HEADLINE: Asian Markets Fail to Sustain Rally

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Asian stock markets fell modestly on Wednesday as analysts and investors digested the details of the massive bailout plans in the United States, and as the poor state of the global economy returned to center stage. 
 In Japan, the Nikkei 225 index, which had rocketed 14.1 percent Tuesday in its biggest-ever one-day jump, eased 1.4 percent Wednesday morning. 
 The prospect of recession in Japan returned Wednesday, with data for August showing Japan's current account surplus shrank 52.5 percent, more than economists had expected. 
 More alarming for the export-dependent Japanese economy, exports during the month edged up only 0.9 percent, while imports soared 20.2 percent from a year earlier, mostly because of higher oil prices. 
 Although a fall in oil prices in recent weeks will have helped importers of the raw material in September, export volumes are expected to soften further as overseas demand, hurt by slowing global growth, falls. 
 Exporters like the leading carmakers Honda, Toyota and Mazda have been hard hit by falling overseas demand, and were among the biggest decliners in Tokyo on Wednesday. 
 Other Asian stock markets also gave up some of their gains from Tuesday, with Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea all declining more than 2 percent. The Standard & Poor's/Australian Stock Exchange 200 index fell 1 percent. The Shanghai Composite and the Taiwex in Taiwan were down about 1.5 percent. 
 The falls echoed those on Wall Street overnight, where the Dow Jones industrial average ended Tuesday 0.8 percent lower at 9,310.99. 
 Despite relief that the international bail-outs appear to have staved off an imminent collapse of the financial system, and signs that interbank lending rates are gradually normalizing, market observers and economists caution that wider damage to the economy has already been done. Many economists now say that a global recession is a certainty.

HEADLINE: Hong Kong Backs Bank Deposits For 2 Years

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Hong Kong's financial regulators announced on Tuesday that they would provide government backing for all of the territory's $773 billion in bank deposits through 2010. 
 Government assistance for banks in Europe and the United States has put pressure on Asian regulators to follow suit, even though Asian banks tend to be better capitalized.
 The Hong Kong Monetary Authority also said that it was prepared to provide capital to the territory's 23 locally incorporated banks, following the example of the United States and Britain. Separately, the Bank of Japan said it would offer an unlimited amount of dollars to banks and other financial institutions at a fixed rate against pooled collateral. 
 Hong Kong banks are already among the most heavily capitalized in the world, and Joseph Yam, the chief executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said at a news conference that he did not think the new measures announced on Tuesday would be needed. The average capital as a share of assets for banks incorporated in Hong Kong is 14 percent, well above the international minimum of 8 percent.
 ''Our banking system is healthy and robust -- however, we must make preparations for a rainy day,'' said John Tsang, the financial secretary of Hong Kong.
 American and European government assistance to banks has forced Asian regulators to worry whether their banks might be considered weak without comparable assistance. Since the failure of Lehman Brothers last month, a succession of previously strong banks have suffered declines in their share prices and have run into trouble borrowing in the interbank market on fears that their balance sheets were weaker than those of their rivals.
 Britain returned Hong Kong to Chinese rule in 1997, but Hong Kong retains a heavily free-market economy with a completely separate banking system and currency from mainland China. The Chinese government still owns all or most of the shares of big mainland banks; these institutions have seen little trouble from global financial troubles because the mainland Chinese financial system is still shielded from international markets by many barriers.
 By contrast, Hong Kong's system is open, including full convertibility into other currencies for the Hong Kong dollar, whose value is closely pegged to the United States dollar.
 Hong Kong currently insures the first 100,000 Hong Kong dollars in an account, worth $12,900. Raymond Li, the chief executive of the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board, said at the same news conference as Mr. Yam that he did not have figures available on the proportion of deposits in Hong Kong that belonged to individuals and companies from elsewhere.
 Li Kui-wai, the director of the Asian economic policy center at the City University of Hong Kong, said that Hong Kong's history of attracting deposits from all over the world meant that the policy initiatives announced on Tuesday could prove costly.
 He questioned if the Hong Kong government and taxpayers could afford a bailout ''if the one million richest people in the world put their money in a Hong Kong bank, and the bank goes broke.''
 Hong Kong's action could put pressure on other international financial centers with very large deposits and limited populations that have not yet issued blanket guarantees of bank deposits, like Switzerland, which has roughly the same population as Hong Kong at about 7 million people.
 Hong Kong will back up its deposit guarantee with its foreign exchange reserves, now $161 billion.
 Hong Kong was the scene of a bank run on Sept. 24 and Sept. 25 when depositors lined up to pull money out of the Bank of East Asia, the territory's third-largest bank by assets. The bank had enough cash to meet the withdrawals and survived the run after regulators assured the public that the bank had ample capital.

HEADLINE: Disappearing Credit Forces Hospitals To Delay Improvements

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
In late August, even before the credit squeeze reached a full state of crisis, a hospital system in Hawaii filed for bankruptcy reorganization after a lender failed to extend a loan for another month. 
 By September, a nonprofit hospital in Philadelphia found it could not borrow money through a traditional bond offering because the municipal bond market had come to a virtual halt. 
 And now, a hospital system in Minnesota says it plans to delay some new buildings, while another hospital group in Connecticut has decided to postpone the replacement of an emergency room. Other hospitals around the country say they are thinking about deferring the purchase of expensive new equipment like computer systems or multimillion-dollar M.R.I. machines. 
 The hospital industry, in other words, is among those struggling with the credit scarcity that the federal government's latest financial bailout plan is meant to alleviate. And lending relief, if it comes, cannot come too soon. 
 Hospitals ''are not immune,'' said Richard L. Clarke, chief executive of the Healthcare Financial Management Association, a professional group for hospital finance executives. He noted that hospitals, like any other business, relied on credit for building projects and to maintain overall liquidity. 
 Tight credit is adding to a financial challenge that some hospitals are already facing, as greater numbers of patients are unable to afford the rising out-of-pocket portions of their medical bills or lack insurance altogether. Many hospitals say they are already seeing an increase in their bad debt -- money they bill patients for but cannot collect. 
 And that problem could get worse, as people worry first about paying their mortgages and credit card bills before dealing with their medical bills, said Gary Taylor, a hospital analyst at Citi Investment Research. ''We're worrying about collection rates falling,'' he said. 
 Despite the stereotypical notion of health care as recession-proof, hospitals worry that if the financial crisis leads to a severe economic downturn, they will feel deep pain. Many are already cutting budgets.
 And that hunkering down by hospitals could have a ripple effect on suppliers of medical equipment like General Electric and Siemens, not to mention the construction industry, analysts say. The labor market could take a hit, too. As major employers, hospitals had been among the bright spots in the country's job statistics, but their hiring is also starting to slow. 
 For hospitals, the current financial environment stands in stark contrast to the recent past. After years of heavy capital spending on new and improved equipment and buildings, outlays that were driven by easy access to credit from banks and bond markets, many hospitals have scaled back their ambitions as they scramble to protect their cash positions. 
 ''Suddenly, the rug is getting yanked out from under them,'' said Patrick Smyth, a consultant at Kurt Salmon Associates, which advises hospitals. 
 Even hospitals that traditionally have been among the best capitalized and financially robust say they are rethinking their priorities and looking for ways to cut expenses. 
 ''We need to focus on tightening our belt,'' said Steven Glass, the chief financial officer for the Cleveland Clinic, the Ohio system that includes some community hospitals as well as its flagship medical center. The economy is particularly tough in northeast Ohio, where Mr. Glass says unemployment is now hovering around 7.5 percent. 
 Tight credit has left some hospitals with few options. Although some recent bankruptcies have involved hospitals that were struggling before the current credit crisis, Hawaii Medical Center said it was forced to file for Chapter 11 simply because it could not find the short-term credit it needed to keep paying its bills. 
 ''Our suspicion is that we are caught up in this market,'' said Salim Hasham, an executive with Hawaii Medical. 
 This year, the Hawaii center bought two hospitals and lined up a $12 million revolving line of credit from Siemens Financial Services, which it said was secured by accounts receivables -- the money owed to the medical center from insurers and patients. Hawaii said it had been meeting the monthly interest payments of $40,000 or so on the loan, but in August, Siemens was unwilling to extend the credit any further. 
 The center had no choice other than to file for bankruptcy, Mr. Hasham said. ''It gives us breathing room to get what we need done.'' 
 Siemens said that it could not comment on its dealings with the Hawaii center, but that it ''remains committed to being a stable financial partner in these unstable times.''
 In Philadelphia, the Albert Einstein Healthcare Network considers itself lucky, according to its chief financial officer, Brian K. Derrick. It was able to get a one-year loan after failing to raise money in the kind of tax-exempt bond offering that not-for-profit hospitals frequently use. 
 The network needed the financing because, as part of the deal to spin itself off from another hospital system, Einstein initially had agreed to repay its share of the system's overall debt. But despite its strong financials and an attractive interest rate of 6.02 percent, Einstein could not raise $90 million through a fixed-rate bond offering it planned in late September. 
 ''It became obvious that week that nothing was selling,'' Mr. Derrick said.
 Because Einstein had already looked into alternate sources of financing, it was able to secure a one-year bank line of credit for $130 million on Sept. 30. The lead banker, as it happened, was Wachovia, whose own problems have since forced it to sell itself to Wells Fargo. Wachovia was able to line up a second bank to help on the deal, and the credit line has not been threatened, according to Mr. Derrick. 
 ''The real challenge is we're in a somewhat short-term situation here,'' said Mr. Derrick, who said Einstein now had a year in which to find permanent financing. 
 Elsewhere, while the construction sites that have become familiar on so many hospital campuses remain active, many hospital executives and consultants say the building boom is likely to subside. ''What you're going to see is a big slowdown in capital expenditures,'' said Russ Rudish, a health care consultant for Deloitte.
 While many hospitals say they have no plans to abandon projects already under way, they are already deferring new ones. 
 In Minneapolis, for example, construction continues on a new 90-bed hospital, Maple Grove, that began in June 2007. ''That's fully funded,'' said James M. Fox, the chief financial officer for Fairview Health Services, which is one of two hospitals that teamed on the $144 million project and jointly financed it through a tax-exempt bond offering, guaranteed by the two health systems. But Fairview has postponed two other building projects. 
 Hospitals are ''trying to minimize the excess bricks and mortar,'' Mr. Fox said. Fairview is also taking a close look at its operations, he said, to see if there are ways to increase cash flow by speeding up collections or reducing less profitable operations. 
 Hospitals also face the prospect of steep cuts in payments from the federal Medicare and state Medicaid programs. Connecticut, for example, recently projected a $300 million shortfall in the entire state budget, which is likely to impinge on its Medicaid program. ''We see a number of clouds on the horizon,'' said Robert G. Kiely, the chief executive of Middlesex Hospital in Connecticut. ''This is a time to be prudent.'' Middlesex has chosen to delay a new emergency room at one of his hospitals for at least a year and half. 
 Rush University Medical Center in Chicago just broke ground on a new 14-floor building, expected to cost about of $550 million. Rush plans to pay for it through a variety of sources, including $220 million of a $350 million bond offering the hospital system still hopes to initiate before the end of the year. Rush officials say that while they are committed to completing that project, others are much less certain. Higher interest on its existing debt is already costing the system more than $2 million more a year than before, said Catherine A. Jacobson, the chief financial officer for Rush, and the hospital is also taking a hit in its investment portfolio.

 DEAL TO SHARE POWER IN ZIMBABWE FALTERS OVER IMMUNITY FOR MILITARY
 Zimbabwe's military commanders have pressed President Robert Mugabe to shield them from prosecution for the violent crackdown on his political foes this year, and his response is threatening to derail a power-sharing deal that was supposed to halt the country's dizzying downward economic spiral. PAGE A6 
 TENSION BETWEEN ITALY AND FRANCE
 A decision by President Nicolas Sarkozy of France not to extradite Marina Petrella, above, a former member of the Red Brigades, the group that terrorized Italy throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s, has provoked outrage in Italy and stirred dormant tensions between the two countries. PAGE A7 
 BRITISH PRIME MINISTER CELEBRATED
 With his brooding aspect and sagging poll numbers, Prime Minister Gordon Brown of Britain seemed to personify the bleak mood of a world traumatized by collapsing house prices, lost jobs and banks that would not lend. But that was last week. After devising a bank rescue plan that has now been endorsed by European and American officials -- and sent global stocks soaring -- he is being celebrated worldwide and has revived his political career PAGE A6 
 COTTON IS KING IN TAJIKISTAN
 The fact that cotton is often grown to the exclusion of other crops in Tajikistan could have catastrophic implications for the country this winter. After a dry summer, Tajikistan and possibly other Central Asian countries are facing severe food shortages, and international aid organizations are girding for a possible crisis. Cotton is at the core of Tajikistan's economy and, some say, corruption. PAGE A12 
 CHINA RECALLS MILK PRODUCTS
 The Chinese government ordered a recall of all milk products produced before Sept. 14 that are still on the shelves so the products can be tested for the toxic chemical melamine. PAGE A8 
 IRAQI CHRISTIANS STILL UNDER SIEGE
 A church in the northern Iraqi city of Mosul was a target on Tuesday, and Christians continued to leave the city, albeit at a slower pace. Some arrived in Baghdad as bitterness about the government's inability to protect the community grew more intense. PAGE A10 
 INDIAN WINS MAN BOOKER PRIZE

 AN AWARD FOR PROGRESS, 
 But Also a Failing Grade
 The Brownsville Independent School District in Texas won what may be the nation's most important prize for excellence in urban education, even as Texas authorities said the same day that the district had failed to meet achievement targets for two years under the federal No Child Left Behind law. The Brownsville district, with about 50 schools and 50,000 students, won in part because its students outperformed those in other Texas districts with similar student populations. Page A17 
 COURT DENIES INMATE'S APPEAL
 Troy A. Davis was on death row, waiting to be executed for murdering Mark A. Macphail, a Savannah, Ga., police officer, senior government officials say, in 1991. But three weeks ago he was temporarily spared the death penalty. Now the Supreme Court has declined to hear his appeal, a decision that will probably lead to a speedy execution. Page A15 
 SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA FIRES CONTINUE
 Wildfires in Southern California have burned nearly 27,000 acres and destroyed 64 structures, including a number of homes. But. the gale-force winds that many anticipated would worsen the situation never arrived. ''I want to thank God and Mother Nature,'' Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa of Los Angeles said. ''Last night could have been a horrendous evening.'' Page A19 
 OBAMA'S LONG TRYOUT
 As the presidential candidates prepare for their final debate at Hofstra University, the encounters have seemed like a long audition for Senator Barack Obama. And while Mr. Obama's debate performances have improved his standing among voters, Senator John McCain's have hurt his. Political Memo. Page A21 
 BUSH DECLARES EXCEPTIONS IN LAWS
 President Bush asserted that he had the power to bypass several parts of two bills: a military authorization act and a measure giving inspectors general greater independence from the White House. The president signed the two measures into law, but then issued signing statements instructing the executive branch to view parts of each as unconstitutional constraints on presidential power. PAGE A17
 HOW MUCH DISTANCE IS TOO MUCH?
 In a time when most Republicans are distancing themselves from their own party, Gordon H. Smith of eastern Oregon is an extreme case. His campaign ads on television have suggested an alliance of views between himself and Senators Barack Obama. He lavishes compliments on Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, and with other Republicans taking notice, perhaps his trumpet is getting too loud. Page A15

 WITH TRADEMARK FANFARE, 
 Apple Introduces New Laptops
 Steve Jobs, the chief executive of Apple, and an inveterate showman, introduced his company's new line of laptop computers to an audience of about 100 reporters, analysts and bloggers. The company hopes that pent-up demand for its portable products and laptops will continue to buoy its sales as others in the electronic industry brace for rough times as consumers spend less. PAGE B11
 THE NEXT CHAPTER OF THE CRISIS
 David Leonhardt says that the next stage in the economic downturn will involve a slump in worker pay -- the worst since the Great Depression. ''Falling pay will weigh on living standards, consumer spending and economic growth, and will help set the political atmosphere that awaits the next president,'' he writes. PAGE B1
 SLOW SALES PROMPT PEPSI LAYOFFS
 PepsiCo, the maker of Pepsi, Doritos and Quaker Oats cereal, said its quarterly earnings were down 10 percent, in part because consumers have stopped buying soft drinks and bottled water. In response, the company is planning to eliminate 3,300 jobs and close as many as six plants. PAGE B8
 DISCOUNTS AND DISAPPOINTMENT
 There is growing evidence that sales of televisions, computers, cameras and other electronics are falling off sharply. That's good news for consumers, who could receive plenty of discounts this fall. But it augurs a very unhappy holiday season for retailers, electronics makers and component suppliers. PAGE B1
 COURT SHUTS DOWN SPAM RING
 An Illinois court ordered an international spam network to shut down, stopping what federal officials said was one of the most prolific spam gangs on the Internet. In January, the group, which went by names like HerbalKings and Click Fusion, was the leading source of spam on the Internet. PAGE B1
 TRUCK MAKER TO CUT 3,500 JOBS
 Daimler, the world's largest maker of heavy vehicles, said it would eliminate its Sterling truck brand and shift production from the United States to Mexico. The moves will cut about 3,500 jobs in Canada and the United States, and about 1,300 layoffs will come in March, when Daimler closes a Sterling factory in St. Thomas, Ontario. ''This is another log on the fire,'' the auto workers' union president said. ''Ontario is going through a crisis in manufacturing.'' PAGE B14

 Section 527 spending, the lightly regulated money that swamped the presidential election in 2004, has fallen so far this year.

 Matt Stairs is a balding, unassuming 40-year-old who hardly looks the part of a sports hero.

 AS POCKETS EMPTY, RESTAURANTS
 Look for New Ways to Fill Them
 In an economy where belts are tightening to the breaking point, restaurants have been loosening things a bit by doing what most people are doing -- working harder. Hours have increased, adding a breakfast shift or late-night hours. Using staff that are already there and adding simple menus adds minimally to the burden but boosts income. Page D1 
 IN A WORD: UMAMI
 Dashi is quick steeped broth of kelp and dried fish. Mmm. No really, it's good. So good in fact that it is making its way from its Japanese origins into the kitchens of Western chefs, many of whom are trained in French technique that relies on slow simmered stocks. But brushed over raw fish before other seasonings are added, or used to finish mushrooms, it brings out a rare depth in the flavors, or ''umami,'' meaning a mouth watering savoriness. Page D3 
 A STAPLE SHOWS ITS SWEET SIDE
 Ah, poor misunderstood couscous: Few are aware of your true nature. Allow Mark Bittman to set the record straight.

 WHEN PLAYS ARE POLITICAL, 
 Liberal Views Dominate Footlights
 Critics who think that the media and institutions of higher education skew toward liberal viewpoints will find no respite in the theater.

HEADLINE: Daimler to Cut Jobs in U.S. and Canada

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

DATELINE: OTTAWA 

 BODY:
Daimler, the world's largest maker of heavy vehicles, announced plans on Tuesday to eliminate its Sterling truck brand and shift production from the United States to Mexico, moves that will cut about 3,500 jobs in Canada and the United States. 
 The head of Daimler Trucks, Andreas Renschler, said that about 88,000 heavy trucks had been idled in the United States since January, a clear indication that the industry was undergoing a significant and perhaps permanent change.
 ''It would be bad leadership to ignore today's economic realities,'' Mr. Renschler told a conference call for analysts and reporters. ''It's a whole new game now.''
 About 1,300 layoffs will come in March when Daimler closes a Sterling factory in St. Thomas, Ontario, according to the Canadian Auto Workers, which represents those employees. About 720 workers at that plant have already been told that they will be laid off next month, when a shift is scheduled to be eliminated.
 Ken Lewenza, the union president, said that Daimler did not notify the union in advance and that most of his members learned about the closing through the news media. He said that the union would press the company to reconsider next week.
 ''This is another log on the fire,'' Mr. Lewenza said. ''Ontario is going through a crisis in manufacturing.''
 Daimler will also move production of most Western Star brand trucks from Portland, Ore., to Santiago, Mexico, in June 2010. 
 In addition to the factory layoffs, Daimler will cut about 1,200 salaried jobs, about half of those at Sterling.

HEADLINE: A Themed Hotel Comes To an Ivy League Town

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
The economy was collapsing around him, but Paul T. McGowan barely took notice last week as he prepared for the opening of his company's first wholly owned hotel: the Study at Yale. 
 Mr. McGowan, the principal at Hospitality 3, was excitedly unwrapping bronze-and-stone bar tops, taste-testing braised pork ribs and refining the jazzy play list for the hotel's iPod-driven sound system. After two years of planning, he was filling in the final details that would complete the transformation of a 1961 building from tired midrange hotel to boutique lodging for the brainy. 
 From its eyeglasses logo to its ''Food for Thought'' room service menu, the Study at Yale aims to make guests feel connected to their Ivy League surroundings. Mr. McGowan, 47, has applied expertise that he gained developing W brand lifestyle hotels for Starwood to create a Hospitality 3 brand aimed at intellectual, sophisticated and well-traveled visitors to the Yale campus. 
 This week's opening of the 124-room establishment comes at a particularly gloomy time for the hotel industry (or any industry, for that matter), but the privileged status of the Yale campus may offer a degree of stability. 
 ''It's a very difficult time to be launching any sort of lodging concept, but he's somewhat insulated in the heart of one of the premier universities in our country,'' said Scott D. Berman, a partner with PricewaterhouseCoopers who leads the hospitality and leisure advisory practice. ''Regardless of the economy, school's in session.'' 
 The Study's site on Chapel Street is ideal for the culturally minded -- it is opposite the Yale School of Art and a block or two from the School of Architecture, the university art gallery and the Center for British Art. 
 There is a major luxury hotel downtown, the 306-room Omni New Haven Hotel at Yale, but Mr. McGowan is aiming for an even higher level of personal service in a more stylistically sophisticated setting. ''Think of it as New York meets New England,'' he said. 
 Downtown New Haven has enjoyed renewed vibrancy in recent years, thanks to state- and city-backed revitalization efforts that have encouraged development of housing, retail establishments and restaurants. On the horizon are a new cancer center at Yale-New Haven Hospital and the relocation of Gateway Community College and the Long Wharf Theater to downtown. 
 The Study's 124 rooms will bring the number of hotel rooms in the downtown area to about 820, according to Ginny Kozlowski, president and chief executive of the Greater New Haven Convention and Visitors Bureau.
 Many of those rooms have recently been upgraded or are about to be. For example, the Newport Hotel Group, based in Middletown, R.I., is adding 47 rooms to its 160-room Courtyard New Haven at Yale, formerly a Holiday Inn, on Whalley Avenue. The firm is also planning renovations at its recently acquired New Haven Hotel on George Street, according to Jon Cohen, Newport's principal. 
 A Hartford firm, Centerplan Development, recently proposed a 240-room luxury hotel at the corner of College and George Streets at the edge of campus, but the credit squeeze has reportedly put that project on hold.
 Downtown could use the additional accommodations, said Bruce Alexander, vice president for New Haven and state affairs at Yale. ''There are many times of the year when there aren't enough first-class hotel rooms in the city, and people end up staying out in the suburbs,'' he said. 
 Yale has allowed three hotels -- the Omni, the Courtyard and the Study -- to add the university's name to their own. There is no cost to the hotels; the university lends its name as a good will effort to support local enterprise. The decision-making process is markedly informal: typically, Mr. Alexander checks out the facility and decides whether to recommend granting it the right to use the university's name. (''It's a subjective determination -- we're not the AAA rating service,'' he said.)
 This is Hospitality 3's first independent hotel project. The company, which has about a dozen employees and offices in New Haven and New York, is a partner in a new W hotel under construction in Hoboken, N.J., but has primarily focused on managing hotel projects for clients. 
 Mr. McGowan will not disclose his firm's total investment in the Study, other than to confirm that it acquired the property, then operating as the Colony Inn, for about $7 million in 2006. The extensive renovation of the five-story building, which had 86 rooms, included the addition of two more stories and a penthouse function room with floor-to-ceiling views of downtown. 
 The architect, KPMB Architects of Toronto, combined modern lines with natural materials like wood, bronze and fabric to lend warmth and familiarity. The building's open glass front is dappled with colored window panes that mimic those found in some of Yale's Collegiate Gothic buildings. A granite staircase leads to the lobby, where a coffee lounge offers guests fat leather chairs with a street-side view. 
 The main floor includes three walnut-paneled meeting rooms, the largest of which accommodates 110 people, and a restaurant and bar with more leather chairs as well as banquette seating. The restaurant, a small-plate venue called Heirloom, is operated by Main Street Restaurant Partners, a New York City firm that owns several restaurants in Manhattan, including Django, Calle Ocho and Rain. 
 Each guest room has a leather armchair and ottoman, along with a work station that runs the length of the window. The beige linen coverlet on each bed is given added heft by a Vermont-made wool blanket. Blue-and-white seersucker guest robes sport the hotel's eyeglasses logo. 
 There are nine suites and most have a separate study with stocked bookshelves. One suite will instead have an artist's studio outfitted with art supplies. 
 Room rates downtown range from roughly $169 to $269, Ms. Kozlowski said. Rates at the Study will be at the upper end of that range. 
 Even before the Study opens, Mr. McGowan is convinced that the concept ''has legs'' enough to be replicated in other college towns; the challenge, he acknowledged, will be finding similarly ideal locations. In the meantime, Yale parents are already greeting the brand with enthusiasm -- the Study is sold out, with a wait list, for commencement weekend.

HEADLINE: Jury Asked to Decide if Girl Died Because of Her Mother's Indifference

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
What did Nixzmary Brown's mother know about her daughter's injuries, and when did she know it? Was she a wickedly indifferent mother or merely an incompetent one? 
 Those were the questions that a prosecutor and a lawyer for the mother, Nixzaliz Santiago, argued on Tuesday as Ms. Santiago's murder trial in Brooklyn came to a close.
 The prosecutor, Ama Dwimoh, showed jurors photographs of the 7-year-old girl's body, covered with bruises and gashes and black eyes in various stages of healing, which, Ms. Dwimoh said, had accumulated for weeks before the child was found dead, as a result of beatings, on Jan. 11, 2006. The prosecutor said that only a mother who did not care about her child could have refused to get her medical help. 
 ''She had every reason to believe she was going to lose this little girl, and she doesn't call for an ambulance,'' Ms. Dwimoh said. ''She doesn't do anything until it's too late.'' 
 One of Ms. Santiago's lawyers, Kathleen M. Mullin, argued that Ms. Santiago had tried to help Nixzmary that January night; that she had tried to get her husband, Cesar Rodriguez, to stop beating Nixzmary; that she meant well but simply failed -- failed to recognize the signs that Nixzmary was dying and failed in her attempts to revive her.
 ''She didn't 'do nothing,' '' Ms. Mullin said. ''She may not have perceived accurately what was happening to Nixzmary, but she did not 'do nothing.' She did what she thought best based on what she perceived.'' 
 Nixzmary's death gripped the city for weeks and spurred an overhaul of the city's child welfare system.
 The jurors' main task is to determine whether Ms. Santiago, 30, is guilty of second-degree murder, under the theory that, by failing to get help for her stricken child, she acted with ''depraved indifference'' and created a grave risk of ''serious physical injury'' that led to the girl's death.
 Mr. Rodriguez, 29, Nixzmary's stepfather, was convicted in March of manslaughter in her death but acquitted of murder; his murder charge was more narrowly worded than Ms. Santiago's. If convicted of murder, Ms. Santiago could be sentenced to life in prison.
 In her summation on Tuesday, Ms. Dwimoh depicted Ms. Santiago, who was raising six children with Mr. Rodriguez, an unemployed security guard, in a three-bedroom apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant, as ''a manipulator, a deflector, an instigator.'' She said Ms. Santiago had urged Mr. Rodriguez to deal with Nixzmary harshly after the child jammed his computer printer, then tried to distance herself from his punishments, which included pounding Nixzmary with his fists and holding her head under the cold-water faucet in the tub.
 ''Nixzaliz is crazy like a fox,'' Ms. Dwimoh said. ''She's sly.''
 Ms. Dwimoh pointed out Ms. Santiago's statements to the police, in which she said that she had followed the sound of Nixzmary's moans to a spare room where Mr. Rodriguez had left the girl naked on the floor, gasping for air, her body freezing. ''You don't need a rocket scientist to know,'' Ms. Dwimoh said. ''She's moaning in pain, she's becoming unresponsive, body temperature is dropping. You get help.''
 Instead, Ms. Santiago told the police, she gave Nixzmary a warm bath, dressed her, tried to get her to drink some water, put her in the room where her brothers and sisters slept and went back to her bedroom to attend to her infant son.
 Ms. Mullin, in her summation, poked holes in the prosecution's timeline of Nixzmary's final days. A medical examiner who testified for the prosecution said that Nixzmary suffered the blow that ultimately killed her on Jan. 8, three days before her body was found. ''The government asks you to accept,'' Ms. Mullin said, ''that on the evening of the 10th, when the doctor tells you Nixzmary Brown was dead, they ask you to accept that not only is she dead but she's arguing with and fighting with Cesar Rodriguez.''
 Ms. Mullin presented an alternate scenario: Ms. Santiago interrupted Mr. Rodriguez twice, asking him to stop beating Nixzmary, then Mr. Rodriguez took the girl to the spare room, duct-taped her mouth so that her screams could not be heard, and only then beat her fatally.
 ''He inflicted these injuries,'' she said, pointing to a photo of Nixzmary's battered body, ''outside of the sight and outside of the hearing of her mother, who had come for her twice.''
 Ms. Mullin invited the jury to convict her client of criminally negligent homicide, a lesser crime that carries a sentence of no more than four years (though jurors are never told the potential sentences that go with crimes). 
 The jury, 10 women and 2 men, is to begin deliberations on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: To Stimulate Bond Sales, the M.T.A. Tries a Radio Pitch by Koch

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN and PATRICK MCGEEHAN

 BODY:
With the credit markets suffering as a result of the global financial crisis, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has taken the unusual step of appealing directly to its riders for help in raising cash -- but not, in this case, with a fare increase. The authority began running radio ads over the weekend, with former Mayor Edward I. Koch promoting the sale of tax-exempt bonds that it uses to finance its large-scale projects. 
 ''These bonds help buy new equipment and maintain the network, which will improve reliability, safety and customer service,'' Mr. Koch says in the ads. 
 The authority typically sells its bonds to large institutional investors; the appeal to the general public is unusual and intended to generate greater demand for its bonds at a time when the credit markets have been badly shaken. The ads tell interested buyers to contact their broker or financial adviser or to go to the authority's Web site, www.mta.nyc.ny.us, where a prominent link will take them to the bond sale prospectus. 
 Still, the ads' effect was not readily apparent on Tuesday as the authority looked to issue $500 million in fare-backed bonds. It would have been its first large offering in several weeks, but the authority ultimately decided to wait until market conditions improved. 
 ''We saw less firmness in demand than we were comfortable with, and so we decided to delay,'' said Gary Dellaverson, the authority's chief operating officer. He said that so far as he knew, the authority had not used radio ads to promote bond sales in the past. 
 He said the authority would look at market conditions on a daily basis to see if demand increases. Greater demand would mean that the authority would be able to pay a lower interest rate.
 ''As you can imagine there are a lot of issuers that are delaying or scaling back their bond issues right now, just because the state of the market is in such flux and such turmoil,'' said Lynnette Kelly Hotchkiss, executive director of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board.
 Mr. Koch did the ad at no charge to the authority. He said that when he was mayor after the financial crisis of the 1970s, the city advertised bond sales in a similar way. He rejected comparisons to the patriotic promotions for war bonds during World War II. 
 ''This is just a good opportunity for the public to make money,'' Mr. Koch said.
 The transportation authority is not unique in being wary of the current bond market. The New York City government is planning to sell about $345 million of bonds for capital improvements within the next week, but only if market conditions are favorable, said Raymond J. Orlando, a spokesman for the city's Office of Management and Budget. He said that the city has also bought radio ads to promote its bond sale. 
 The State of New York Mortgage Agency postponed a sale of $250 million in bonds last week and is now considering a significantly smaller offering that would be more appealing to individual investors, said Philip Lentz, a spokesman for the agency.
 Not all municipal borrowing was shut down, however. In Connecticut, officials of the town of Avon had expected to have trouble refinancing some short-term debt on Tuesday, but were pleasantly surprised. 
 The town took bids for about $25 million of one-year notes, that funded a new high school gym and renovations to the town hall, said Philip K. Schenck, the town manager. A Boston bank was the winning bidder, offering an interest rate well below what the town had expected to pay, he said.
 New Jersey's state government has not had to withdraw any planned bond sales, but some towns are having trouble raising money, said Thomas Vincz, a spokesman for the state treasurer. Mr. Vincz said Gov. Jon S. Corzine was expected to lay out a plan for helping local governments later this week.

HEADLINE: General Growth, a Mall Owner, May Be Facing a Sale

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
It took only six weeks of negotiations for General Growth Properties, the nation's second-largest shopping mall owner and operator, to agree to buy the Rouse Company in 2004 for $12.6 billion, a breathtaking price at the time.
 Now that hasty decision, which drew immediate fire from Wall Street analysts, has come back to haunt General Growth and may lead to the sale of the 54-year-old company, whose widely known properties include Ala Moana Center in Honolulu, Water Tower Place in Chicago and the Grand Canal Shoppes at the Venetian in Las Vegas.
 General Growth's acquisition of Rouse, which was known for its innovative planned communities like Columbia, Md., and its ''festival marketplaces'' like Faneuil Hall in Boston and the South Street Seaport in Manhattan, was financed almost entirely with short-term mortgage debt. This financing strategy, with debt equal to more than 70 percent of its capitalization, raised fears that General Growth, a real estate investment trust based in Chicago with more than 200 shopping centers, had become overleveraged -- fears that have now been borne out. The deal included $5.4 billion of Rouse's debt. 
 ''They believed that credit markets would continue to be friendly and they would have ample opportunities to restructure their debt,'' said Keven S. Lindemann, the director of real estate for SNL Financial, a research company in Charlottesville, Va. ''But the capital markets turned against them.''
 Earlier this month, the company dismissed its longtime chief financial officer and suspended its dividend. Moody's Investors Service, Fitch and Standard & Poor's have reduced the company's credit ratings.
 John Bucksbaum, chief executive since 1999 of the company founded by his father, Matthew, and an uncle, Martin, who died in 1995, declined to be interviewed. But in a recent statement, General Growth said it was exploring a variety of options, including the sales of individual properties and partnerships with other companies, to ''align the market value of the company's common stock more closely with the intrinsic value'' of its shopping malls. 
 The company has also postponed $1.1 billion of projects, according to Green Street Advisors, a research company in Newport Beach, Calif., including an open-air retail and office development with 1.5 million square feet in Summerlin, Nev., the vast planned community near Las Vegas that it acquired in the Rouse merger.
 Despite these efforts, Rich Moore, a retail REIT analyst at RBC Capital Markets, predicted that another large shopping mall operator, or a combination of rival companies, would end up buying General Growth. ''The reality is, given this credit crunch, they're up against the wall,'' Mr. Moore said. Possible suitors for all or parts of the company include the Simon Property Group, the Westfield Group and Vornado Realty Trust.
 Giving up the company would be a humiliating blow for Mr. Bucksbaum, a cycling enthusiast whose family ranked No. 205 on Forbes magazine's most recent list of the 400 richest Americans. The company traces its roots to a family grocery business in Marshalltown, Iowa, which Mr. Bucksbaum's father and uncle expanded into one of the Midwest's earliest shopping centers, the Town and Country Center in Cedar Rapids, in 1954. The company moved its headquarters to Chicago in 1997.
 Like most REITs, General Growth grew by acquiring other companies. Jim Sullivan, a senior analyst at Green Street Advisors, said John Bucksbaum's biggest mistake was giving Bernard Freibaum, the chief financial officer for 15 years, an unusual degree of autonomy. ''He was the architect of a financial strategy that did not provide for flexibility when things got tough,'' Mr. Sullivan said. 
 Analysts say that General Growth is considered a strong mall operator whose woes are not a reflection of its performance. In more ways than not, General Growth resembles the industry leader, the Simon Property Group. Like Simon, General Growth has a mixture of highly successful shopping centers and others that are less productive. ''The overwhelming share of their growth and income comes from their top 50 to 70 malls,'' said Paul Morgan, a REIT analyst at Friedman, Billings, Ramsey & Company, referring to both companies. But the ratio of Simon's debt to its market capitalization is only 40 percent, he said. 
 In a conference call with analysts on July 31, Mr. Bucksbaum said that mall occupancy during the second quarter was 93.2 percent, a record. The company has remained largely unaffected by the wave of recent retail bankruptcies, with store closings amounting to fewer than 1 percent. And though sales per square foot did not increase since last year, they averaged a healthy $459 a square foot, with the strongest 50 malls generating an average of $648 a square foot, he said. 
 But the company has $8.5 billion in debt coming due before the end of 2010, most of it in the form of maturing mortgage loans. Refinancing the debt is considered highly unlikely because of the credit squeeze and the decline in retail real estate values stemming from the economic downturn.
 And General Growth has made other mistakes as well. It already had a presence in Las Vegas with the Meadows, Boulevard and Grand Canal malls when it bought Rouse, the owner of the Fashion Show mall as well as Summerlin. The $1 billion in debt coming due this year includes loans on the Fashion Show and the Shoppes at the Palazzo, the new mall that General Growth recently acquired from the Las Vegas Sands. ''They put a lot of eggs in a basket that was already pretty full,'' Mr. Sullivan said.
 The Las Vegas area has been hit especially hard by the housing crisis, and tourism is also feeling the effects of the downturn. From August 2007 to August 2008, the number of visitors to the city declined by 4.3 percent and gambling revenue was down by 9.4 percent, the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority reported.
 In an embarrassing legal defeat, General Growth was ordered last November to pay $74.2 million in compensatory damages to a private developer, Caruso Affiliated Holdings, after a jury found that it had tried to block the Cheesecake Factory restaurant chain from opening in a new shopping center adjacent to its own Glendale Galleria in California.
 Shares of General Growth, already battered by its debt problems, recently plummeted further as executives, including Mr. Freibaum, were forced to sell millions of dollars worth of stock to satisfy margin calls. (The Bucksbaum family did not sell any shares, the company said.)
 General Growth's struggles have not stopped the company from pursuing development opportunities. In June, the company announced an ambitious redevelopment plan for the South Street Seaport that would include a 42-story apartment and hotel tower. Last week, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York designated General Growth as one of the developers of a 1.7-million-square-foot development between Second and Third Avenues and 125th and 127th Streets in East Harlem.
 General Growth is hardly the only shopping center company in trouble these days. The Centro Properties Group, a strip center company based in Melbourne, Australia, has faced similar short-term debt problems since its acquisition last year of New Plan Excel Realty Trust, a United States REIT. Feldman Mall Properties of Great Neck, N.Y., which owns seven shopping centers across the country, disclosed last month that it might go out of business by the end of the year.
 But those companies were never in General Growth's league.
 ''This is a blue-chip, incredibly well-respected company with a founding family that helped build the mall business in this country,'' Mr. Sullivan said.

HEADLINE: Those Hard-Boiled Eggheads

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
I'm not sending Paul Krugman Champagne.
 He won the Nobel prize in economics this week, and while I'm sure that's delightful for him, it has raised the bar to an impossible height for his fellow columnists at The Times. We used to strive for Pulitzers, or simply regional awards, or even just try to top each other on the paper's most e-mailed list.
 Now we're supposed to compete for Nobels? 
 It's a total disaster. Any minute, Krugman might swagger into the office wearing that big old 24-karat-gold-plated medal around his neck like a World Wrestling championship belt, talking about how beautiful Sweden is.
 So I must aim higher. Much higher.
 A Nobel in economics is out. I didn't take economics in college because all the classes started at 8 a.m. Physics, chemistry and medicine are out. Literature? They've given up giving it to Americans. So it's going to have to be the Nobel Peace Prize.
 I tried to think of a horrible war going on that needed my mediation skills. And then it hit me: The conservative donnybrook over Sarah Palin, the peppery debate raging about whether she is an embarrassment who should fade away or an impudent but promising wine picked before its time.
 Republicans have been slugging it out over whether Palin is dragging John McCain down or whether his campaign is mishandling her. The governor's favorability rating is now 32 percent, according to the new Times/CBS News poll, plummeting 8 points from earlier this month, and her unfavorable rating soared 9 percentage points to 41 percent.
 On Tuesday, Matthew Dowd, the former Bush strategist who offered a famous apologia for helping get W. re-elected, offered a scorching assessment of Palin's not being ready, saying that McCain ''knows that in his gut. And when this race is over, that is something he will have to live with. ... He put somebody unqualified on that ballot, and he put the country at risk.''
 Christopher Hitchens endorsed Barack Obama on Slate on Monday, calling Palin's conduct ''a national disgrace'' and writing: ''Given the nasty and lowly task of stirring up the whack-job fringe of the party's right wing and of recycling patent falsehoods about Obama's position on Afghanistan, she has drawn upon the only talent that she apparently possesses.''
 Christopher Buckley endorsed Obama on The Daily Beast, writing of McCain's embrace of Palin: ''What on earth can he have been thinking?'' (The endorsement led to Buckley's resigning from The National Review, founded by his father.)
 On ''The Colbert Report'' on Monday, the conservative columnist Kathleen Parker stuck by her assertion, which she said caused the base to treat her like a traitor, that Palin should have bowed out. She said she'd gotten some secret e-mails from Republicans in the White House agreeing with her.
 William Kristol, a Palin fan who thinks she has been horribly managed, wrote in The Times on Monday that McCain should fire his campaign for malpractice. David Brooks, speaking at an Atlantic Magazine event, called Palin ''a fatal cancer to the Republican Party,'' bemoaning the fact that she did not fit in with the late William Buckley's desire to have a party that celebrated ideas and learning.
 I started my campaign to win a Nobel prize by trying to make peace between the two conservatives at odds on our Op-Ed page.
 I called Kristol and asked him if he thought Palin could grow into the next Reagan, reminding him that he was outnumbered by conservatives recoiling from her.
 ''Conservative eggheads are my friends,'' he said, ''but politically they're a contrarian indicator. If they're down on Palin, things are looking up for her. With all due respect for my fellow eggheads, they are underestimating the importance of a natural political gift or star quality. It matters a lot.''
 He suggested that she has a shrewdness and toughness -- ''like Andrew Jackson'' -- beyond what you get with a Yale law degree or Harvard business degree. ''That may be hard for my conservative intellectual friends to grasp,'' he said.
 I didn't seem to be soothing the waters. I called Brooks, who conceded: ''Her political delivery skills are incredible.''
 So you agree with Kristol that she might be a star in the party? Could Palin be the nominee in 2012?
 ''The short answer is no,'' Brooks said. ''She has reinforced the worst of talk-radio culture. The party will need a leader to strike out in a new direction, a fiscally conservative president more like a high-tech Teddy Roosevelt. Someone with gravitas.''
 So much for brokering a peace accord. I'll have to leave the eggheads boiling.

HEADLINE: Deficit Hits $455 Billion, Highest Percent Since '04

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The federal budget deficit rose to $455 billion in the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30 as financial market strains slowed economic growth while spending rose the most since 1990. 
 By comparison, the deficit a year earlier was $162 billion, while the previous high was $413 billion in 2004, the Treasury said Tuesday. The gap was 3.2 percent of the gross domestic product, up from 1.2 percent last year, the Treasury said. 
 The 2008 deficit was the largest as a share of the economy since 2004, when it was 3.6 percent of the gross domestic product, the government's principal measure of the country's output of goods and services.
 By comparison, under President Ronald Reagan and the first President Bush, the deficit was more than 4 percent of the gross domestic product. 
 The final total for 2008 was higher than the Congressional Budget Office's Oct. 7 projection of $438 billion.
 In a statement, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said, ''This year's budget results reflect the ongoing housing correction, and the manifestations of that in strained capital markets and slower growth.'' 
 Mr. Paulson added that the figures ''reinforce the need to not only address short-term challenges, but pursue policies that promote economic growth and fiscal responsibility, and address entitlement reform.''
 Total spending in 2008 rose 9.1 percent to $2.98 trillion from a year earlier, the biggest jump in annual outlays since a 9.6 percent gain in 1990. Revenue decreased 1.2 percent to $2.52 trillion, the first drop since 2003.
 For the month of September, the government posted a surplus of $45.7 billion, less than half the surplus of $112.9 billion last September, the Treasury said.
 Corporate income tax revenue fell 18 percent.

HEADLINE: British Prime Minister's Stock Rises as His Bank Plan Lifts Stocks Worldwide

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS JR

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
With his brooding aspect and sagging poll numbers, Prime Minister Gordon Brown had seemed to personify the bleak mood of a world traumatized by collapsing house prices, lost jobs and banks that would not lend.
 But that was last week.
 After devising a bank rescue plan that has now been endorsed by European and American officials -- and has sent global stocks soaring -- he is being celebrated worldwide and has revived a political career that the ''commentariat,'' as Mr. Brown disdainfully refers to the chattering classes, had predicted would soon be at an end. 
 While Mr. Brown, 57, has moved up in the polls, he still trails his younger conservative rival, the fresh-faced David Cameron, 42, whose months of deft parliamentary jabs helped define Mr. Brown as a leaden, out of touch leader.
 But for all the troubles of the British economy, and after a 10-year apprenticeship as chancellor of the Exchequer under Prime Minister Tony Blair, Mr. Brown is suddenly in his element, proudly pointing to his long experience. 
 ''Now is not the time,'' he said in a pointed jab at Mr. Cameron, ''for a novice.''
 Before a packed room of foreign journalists on Tuesday, the many aspects of Gordon Brown were on full display.
 The son of a severe Presbyterian minister, he decried the culture of bonuses in finance and promised that high pay would be reined in at government-owned banks. As a student of international finance, he argued for the formation of a global body to oversee today's complex capital flows.
 And, forgetting for the moment his past enthusiasm for the free-wheeling global capitalism championed by Alan Greenspan, the former Federal Reserve chairman, whom Mr. Brown has called a mentor, he took full credit where he seemed to feel credit was due.
 ''We defined the problem as strengthening the banks so that they could deal with their bad assets,'' he said of his plan of injecting money directly into banks in return for the government's taking ownership shares. He argued that the issue was not only providing additional funds for the banking system but also getting banks themselves to lend again to their business customers and consumers alike.
 Then he dropped the names of those that had fallen in line with the Brown approach: much of Europe, Australia, New Zealand and, on Tuesday, too late for him to name it, Hong Kong.
 Not to mention the United States, he added, saying that he would soon speak to President Bush, who went on television Tuesday morning to endorse a remarkably similar plan from his Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr.
 ''I am pleased that countries around the world have moved to these proposals,'' Mr. Brown concluded.
 A British head of government does not typically attract the notice of his European and American counterparts. And that is particularly true of Mr. Brown, who takes pride in his flintiness and his sharp contrast to Mr. Blair.
 He sat alone at a table, dressed in a loose-fitting suit and a featureless tie, more technocrat than politician as he gave a short lesson on the roots of the mortgage crisis, touching on topics including triple-A rated mortgage securities, the Bretton Woods agreement that established the post-World War II global economic framework, and the demand for oil in China and India.
 But the more than 100 journalists in his audience were in no mood for lectures.
 Would you call yourself a superhero? a reporter asked. What do you think of Paul Krugman, the Princeton professor and Op-Ed page columnist for The New York Times, who was just awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics referring to you as the savior of the world? Are you planning to call a snap election?
 He could not help but wallow a bit. The FTSE 100 stock index was up strongly from its recent lows, and even the British pound had reversed its downward trend.
 In response to one awestruck question on Tuesday, Mr. Brown was characteristically cautious. ''I'm grateful for your deep interest in my personal fate,'' he said. ''But politics is about ups and downs, and you need to treat them both with equanimity.''
 Until the last few days, it was mostly down. Less than a year ago, during one particularly vicious round of parliamentary debate, an opposition party member said that Mr. Brown had gone from Stalin to Mr. Bean, the bumbling British comedian, creating chaos out of order instead of the reverse.
 In interviews, Mr. Brown has compared his crisis management to that of Captain MacWhirr in Joseph Conrad's ''Typhoon,'' who knowingly sailed his ship into the great storm before him. He was a man of ''literal mind'' and ''dauntless temperament,'' wrote Conrad, but who also had ''just enough imagination to carry him through each successive day, and no more.'' 
 Despite his powerful intellect -- he entered college at 16 and has a Ph.D. in history -- and his 10 years overseeing a once ascendant British economy, Mr. Brown has repeatedly suffered by comparison with Mr. Blair. 
 But now, in contrast to Mr. Blair's decision to follow President Bush in the invasion of Iraq, Mr. Brown is hoping to achieve a greater stature for Britain by asserting his independence, coming up with a plan that veered from Washington's approach but then was followed by the Bush administration almost to the letter.
 Not content to stop there, however, Mr. Brown is calling for a supranational body to address the ''lack of transparency, accountability and responsibility'' that led to the crisis.
 That may be fine talk, but regulatory specialists are not clear how it will actually happen.
 ''Mr. Brown has a good record on this topic,'' said Sir Howard Davies, director of the London School of Economics and former chairman of Britain's top regulator, the Financial Services Authority. ''But I am not sure that you can turn the International Monetary Fund into a super regulator.''
 At the moment, the combined efforts of Mr. Brown and Alistair Darling -- his equally dyspeptic chancellor, who just two months ago was ridiculed for saying that Britain's economic downturn could be the worst in 60 years -- seem to be in tune with a revulsion that Britons express about their high-flying bankers.
 Still, there is no doubt that Mr. Brown is more comfortable discussing reform of the International Monetary Fund than sipping tea with a middle-class couple in Birmingham who are overwhelmed by soaring electricity bills and mortgage payments.
 Unlike Mr. Blair and Bill Clinton, he is not good at feeling other people's pain, although he has had his share of suffering. A kick in the head during a rugby game when he was 16 caused him to lose sight in his left eye; he was forced to wait all those years before becoming prime minister; and most recently he lost his first child. 
 And no matter how much the international community may cheer him, Mr. Brown must ultimately face a deeply discontented British electorate before June 2010. But finally, things are looking up.
 As the press conference came to an end, a Swedish journalist asked Mr. Brown if he was Flash Gordon. He made the quickest of smiles and his faced flushed an immediate red.
 ''No, just Gordon,'' he said. ''Just Gordon.''

HEADLINE: For Times Like These, Pep Talks And Hugs

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
''We have to prepare ourselves psychologically and emotionally because the world has changed forever,'' Anthony Robbins, a well-known motivational speaker, said on the ''Today'' show on Monday. And Mr. Robbins has tweaked his message accordingly, promoting a new Web site, thepowerofcrisis.com. 
 While it is to be expected that a life coach who has amassed a fortune through self-empowerment speeches, tapes and even energy drinks would urge followers to seek their inner power in economic ruin, Mr. Robbins is not the only prophet of doom-is-good-for-you. Right after Sept. 11, some humorists in New York declared that irony was dead. Now some celebrity economists and financial advisers are telling viewers that greed is so over. 
 Viewers flipping channels for guidance or reassurance about their college loans, mortgages or 401(k)'s are getting it (up to a point), and a lot more. In the hours and days since the stock market crashed, then fluttered back to life -- if a volatile one -- television has spun an uplifting riches to rags narrative out of a shattered and murky economic picture.
 ''It should bring back some old American values that we've all forgotten about, such as thrift and saving, and that's not all bad,'' Julian H. Robertson Jr., a former hedge-fund manager who shut his company, Tiger Management, in 2000, told the CNBC anchor Erin Burnett on Monday. He said he expected the recession to last as long as 10 or 15 years, and almost seemed to welcome that slowdown: ''We will be a better country when these things have gone into effect.'' 
 In a crisis, television has a weird way of pushing viewers in two directions at the same time. The surfeit of scary images, be they falling buildings or weeping stockbrokers, stokes panic. But the repetition of those images -- and on cable news shows, they are repeated over and over -- has a numbing effect: the unimaginable turns familiar, then quickly becomes old news. 
 On Friday, a day on which the market tumbled, ratings for business news channels spiked. It was probably the worst possible time for newcomers to look in on CNBC or Fox Business Network, a little like walking into an emergency room after a major train collision and being stampeded by doctors and nurses running through the halls shouting ''stat.'' At week's end, reporters on the floor of the Stock Exchange were hollering to be heard and using words like ''hysterical'' and ''panic'' and ''really, really anxious'' while beneath them, tickers turned red, and breaking news flashes were blue: ''Iceland P.M. says country is not bankrupt.''
 By Monday a major recession was not just a given, it was a salvation of sorts, a chance for Americans to get in touch with their inner pioneer, all grit, gumption and Little House on the Foreclosure Block. 
 On ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' the financial advice guru Suze Orman practiced some of her trademark tough love on the 25-year-old Hannah, whose profligate spending on clothes, pedicures and restaurant dinners had driven her deeply into debt. This time it wasn't just her reckless deficit spending that incensed Ms. Orman, it was her values, and Ms. Winfrey agreed. 
 ''You were bemoaning the fact that you can't keep up with the Joneses,'' Ms. Winfrey scolded. In a segment taped over several weeks, Hannah proved she could keep her expenses down, walking to work, packing her lunch, doing her own nails. Then Ms. Orman gave Hannah her stamp of approval because she had chosen ''integrity'' over ''impressing everybody.''
 On ''Today'' Ann Curry had a round with Mr. Robbins, and added her own brand of can-do spirit to his think-positive pep talk. ''So what you're talking about then is just having kind of grit,'' she said. ''And I think that, you know, we forget how much grit we have.'' 
 After Mr. Robbins listed some of the practical steps panicked people should take, including exercise, Ms. Curry asked if she could add a recommendation of her own: ''Hug people,'' she said. ''And just, you know, embrace human beings who are all around you, and make sure that you're a good friend so they can be a good friend to you, and you'll feel better.''
 That was one piece of advice that the business channels didn't entirely take to heart. Fox Business has a new negative ad campaign about its rival channel, warning CNBC viewers to stay away from one of that network's stars, Jim Cramer, the host of ''Mad Money,'' because, among other things, he urged viewers back in mid-September to buy Wachovia, and later had to apologize for the bad steer. 
 ''The last thing you need is bad advice,'' the ad says. ''The last thing you need is Cramer.''
 Mr. Cramer was on ''The View'' on Tuesday, and there he did get hugs from the hosts, including from their special guest E. D. Hill, of Fox News Channel.
 Even the normally excitable and hyperbolic Mr. Cramer seemed in tune with the new embrace of old Depression-era values, telling the audience that this is a time ''to preserve what you have, save and figure out what you need for the next few years.'' Unfettered, unregulated free-market capitalism, he declared, is ''done.''

HEADLINE: From 2 Rivals, 2 Prescriptions

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
With Senator John McCain unveiling a $52.5 billion package of proposals on Tuesday, both presidential candidates have now outlined their plans for addressing the economic crisis, leaving voters with a clear choice when it comes to one of the biggest challenges the next president will face.
 Mr. McCain's new plans include tax cuts on capital gains and on withdrawals from retirement accounts by people 59 and older, bigger write-offs for stock losses and a tax waiver for unemployment benefits.
 Those proposals, which would be effective for two years, complement an overall economic program that hews to the Republican playbook: tax cuts geared especially to individuals and businesses at the top of the income scale, in the belief that they will stimulate the economy and create jobs that benefit everyone.
 ''If I am elected president,'' Mr. McCain said Tuesday in Blue Bell, Pa., ''I will help to create jobs for Americans in the most effective way a president can do this, with tax cuts that are directed specifically to create jobs and protect your life savings.'' 
 The $60 billion stimulus package that Senator Barack Obama announced Monday, combined with his longstanding economic agenda, reflect Democratic emphasis on tax cuts intended for middle-class and low-wage workers and for the smallest businesses, as well as spending increases for public works to create jobs. 
 In setting out his approach on Monday, Mr. Obama predicted that in the long run he would create ''five million new, high-wage jobs'' by investing in renewable-energy industries and ''two million jobs by rebuilding our crumbling roads, schools and bridges.''
 Even with the new proposals, which come on top of the hundreds of billions of dollars the government has already committed to bail out financial institutions and other faltering corporations, both candidates continue to promise that as president they would reduce the ballooning annual budget deficits, without forfeiting any of the big-ticket promises they made pre-crisis.
 Mr. McCain stands by his vow to extend the Bush tax cuts and to layer on several more, including a big reduction in corporate income taxes. And he still insists he would balance the budget by the end of his first term in 2013, though few analysts, if any, believe that is possible. 
 Mr. Obama vows to reduce deficits, while keeping his early promises for near-universal health care coverage and more. Because oil prices have been falling, he has shelved a proposal to offset the estimated $65 billion cost of his proposed tax rebates to the middle class with a windfall-profits tax on oil companies, leaving himself an even bigger budget gap. 
 ''Before the crisis, neither of them was telling how it really was going to be,'' said the economist Robert D. Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office. ''Now one really doesn't know how it's going to be because we seem to have blown away any notion of fiscal limitations.''
 ''At some point,'' Mr. Reischauer added, ''we as a nation are going to have to ask, 'Where are we going to get the money to do all this, and at what price?' That's the question no one can answer.''
 For now, both parties have taken the position that action is more important than short-term budget discipline. The politics of the moment, less than three weeks from the election, almost demanded that the candidates flesh out their philosophical approaches with detailed proposals to try to mitigate the effects of what could be a serious recession. 
 ''Combine a time of potential national crisis with the last weeks of an election, and you have two powerful forces for politicians to show they care through a smorgasbord of supposedly new policies,'' said C. Eugene Steuerle, vice president of the nonpartisan Peter G. Peterson Foundation, which was formed to raise awareness about the nation's economic challenges.
 Whatever the relative merits and flaws, both candidates' proposals would most likely have some short-term benefit for investors, homeowners, retirees and other groups.
 They have been less forthcoming about the longer-term challenges facing the economy, from a low savings rate to the related problem of an aging population and rapidly rising costs of the two big entitlement programs, Social Security and Medicare. 
 Besides their own proposals, the candidates' different approaches have been evident in their responses to the emergency actions of the Bush administration. Mr. Obama gave early public support to the Treasury's move this week to inject $250 billion into major banks. Mr. McCain was silent on the approach for days as the action was under consideration; his party's free-market conservatives were outraged by the plan, and Mr. McCain's economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, said it was ''not the way things should be done in the United States.'' 
 The capital injection plan was widely credited with steadying the financial markets in the last two days, and on Tuesday Mr. McCain gave grudging approval. He told a reporter in Florida, ''Well, I feel we're in a crisis, but I want us out of the banking business as quickly as possible.''
 Mr. Obama, like other Democrats, would provide billions in aid to strapped states, which have fewer revenue-raising options, so they can keep financing public works and avoid cutting education and Medicaid health programs -- by far the states' biggest expenses. Mr. McCain, like Republicans generally, opposes sending more money to states and cities, maintaining that it discourages them from cutting spending.
 Mr. Obama has proposed several actions that could be taken in a lame-duck session of Congress, before the next president takes office. For example, he has called on the Democratic-controlled Congress to expedite his proposed middle-class tax cut of $500 for individuals and $1,000 for couples so that the Internal Revenue Service could potentially get rebate checks to taxpayers before Inauguration Day on Jan. 20. 
 Mr. McCain mostly has proposed steps that he has said he would pursue after he is president, though advisers say a lame-duck Congress could pass the tax breaks proposed on Tuesday. Those would be for tax years 2008 and 2009, meaning taxpayers would not see the first benefits for months after January.
 That $52.5 billion plan is on top of Mr. McCain's announcement last week that, as president, he would order his Treasury secretary to begin buying up to $300 billion in troubled mortgages from lenders, and replace them for the homeowners with government-guaranteed mortgages reflecting their homes' lower value. While Mr. McCain initially said that lenders would cover the cost, a day later his campaign said that taxpayers would do so.
 On Tuesday, Mr. Obama called the McCain mortgage plan one of his ''very bad ideas.'' But the mortgage relief has also drawn opposition from the right, including Republican leaders in Congress, casting doubts on the proposal's prospects. Administration officials are critical of Mr. McCain's plan to use the government's $700 billion bailout funds, since that money is for propping up struggling financial institutions nationwide. And Americans scraping to pay their mortgages are already objecting to bailing out others. 
 But Mr. Holtz-Eakin, in a conference call with reporters on Tuesday, said the benefits would go far beyond the homeowners saved from losing their homes. ''Then the houses as a result do not sit vacant and lead to neighborhood blight,'' Mr. Holtz-Eakin said. ''We stabilize the housing values for every American homeowner who has seen their house values fall and their property taxes go up. We break that cycle.''
 The tax breaks would mostly go to older Americans. Whatever their policy benefits, they could hold political gains in a group that is about 40 percent of the electorate and whose support Mr. McCain has been losing. 
 ''It's not clear that either of these plans would do much good,'' said Leonard Burman, director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. ''But the benefits of Obama's plan would be more widely distributed. McCain's tax proposals would help most those with pretty high incomes -- the group least in need of assistance.''
 Mr. McCain's most costly proposal, at $36 billion, would let people 59 and older who withdraw money from IRAs or 401(k) plans pay a tax rate of 10 percent, instead of current rates of up to 35 percent for the most affluent ''to help the seniors who are counting on their retirement accounts to manage their lifestyles,'' Mr. Holtz-Eakin said.
 Mr. McCain would halve to 7.5 percent the current 15 percent tax on investors' capital gains. Mr. Obama was critical, telling reporters, ''Nobody really has capital gains right now.'' 
 As for those with stock losses, Mr. McCain would raise to $15,000 from $3,000 the amount they could deduct. Both tax proposals would disproportionately benefit older taxpayers.
 But even some in his own party say Mr. Obama has pandered to older Americans as well. He has long called for eliminating income taxes for older people with less than $50,000 in income.
 On retirement accounts, given the market's drop, both candidates proposed to waive the requirement that at age 70 1/2, taxpayers had to begin withdrawing their savings. 
 But where Mr. McCain proposed a lower tax rate for older Americans who do withdraw money, including the wealthy, Mr. Obama would help younger savers who tap into their retirement accounts to get by in the downturn. He would waive the 10 percent tax penalty for withdrawals before age 59 1/2. Many economists object that doing so would further reduce the already low savings rate in the United States.

HEADLINE: Hofstra University Is Agog Over the Presidential Debate on Its Turf

BYLINE: By JAVIER C. HERNANDEZ

DATELINE: HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. 

 BODY:
No corner of Hofstra University, it seems, is safe from politics these days. The chatter in the courtyards and the cafeteria inevitably circles back to the third and final presidential debate, which is to take place at the university on Wednesday night.
 Even the gymnasium has been transformed for the big event, with its floors covered in red carpet and a bald eagle fixture reigning over the basketball court. 
 And in the classrooms, the battle between Senators John McCain and Barack Obama seems to be getting as much attention as the great wars of history, at least this week. In a course on presidential elections, students analyzed the role of race in the 2008 campaign by drawing on the civil rights movement. In a class on nonverbal communication, they dissected Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr.'s laugh and Gov. Sarah Palin's wink.
 ''I've noticed a level of engagement in classes I haven't seen before this semester,'' said Ken M. Donovan, 21, a double major in history and secondary education. ''The debate has really caused people to take a new look at things and think more deeply about these issues.''
 In anticipation of the debate, the university has been offering political courses across disciplines, with such titles as ''From Abigail Adams to Hillary Clinton: Can a Woman Be Elected President of the United States?'' and ''The Biological Impacts of Climate Change.'' And since Hofstra got word last year that it would be the site of the debate, the school has held numerous events -- some with standing-room-only crowds -- featuring commentators and politicians.
 In a course on presidential elections and history this week, Mr. Donovan and his classmates shared political articles that they had clipped from newspapers. They took turns commenting on the last debate, heatedly discussing Mr. McCain's reference to Mr. Obama as ''that one.'' 
 Carolyn Eisenberg, who teaches the course, said on Tuesday that she had tried to show students the historical roots of presidential debates and to tie current events to the debates of past elections.
 ''Right now, a lot of the Civil Rights Act seems remote to them,'' she said. ''I'm trying to get them open to thinking about historical patterns and to see how this event on their campus fits into larger history.''
 Dr. Eisenberg is also teaching courses meant to inspire debate among students about United States policy in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay. She said those courses filled up in three days -- faster than any course she has taught.
 ''There are certain moments on our campus when kids are very attentive to public affairs, but having our debate on campus has really made them feel like they are at the center of things,'' she said.
 Lisa Merrill, a professor of performance studies, put together a course called ''Democracy in Performance'' that is staging historical re-enactments, including mock slave auctions and debates about women's rights. Dr. Merrill said that in preparing students for the debate, she tried to incorporate historical issues that would likely surface throughout the campaign, including race, gender and the economy.
 ''By getting students to not just read about the historical events that lead up to the moment of debate but to become the characters themselves, they get excited and interested in a whole different way,'' she said.
 In a courtyard in the south part of the campus, Christine M. Foley adjusted her spiky crown and robe in preparation for her debut as Lady Liberty. Ms. Foley said the debate had spurred a desire among students to learn more about the past. 
 In Dr. Merrill's class, students have picked apart what they saw as Mr. McCain's stiffness on stage and the fact that Mr. Obama's polished demeanor can sometimes deflect attention from his words.
 Ms. Foley said classroom discussion could get heated, even though Mr. Obama appeared by far to be the favorite of the student population.
 ''It's completely different than the last election,'' she said, adding that Hofstra's being host of the debate had ''actually opened people's eyes to this election.''
 Even for those not tracking the daily blips of the polls, the hullabaloo of the debate has been hard to ignore. The Secret Service and the state and local police have been monitoring the area, and some roads around campus will be closed to traffic on Wednesday. 
 The university expects about 3,100 members of the media in addition to hundreds of audience members (7,000 students entered a lottery for several hundred seats) and an undisclosed number of security personnel.
 The Commission on Presidential Debates brings the traveling debate stage to each location, but it relies on hundreds of student volunteers to work at the doors and to serve as guides around the campus. 
 Peter Eyre, a spokesman for the debates commission, said that holding debates at universities was a way to give students opportunities they would normally not have. The debates have even become networking opportunities, leading to jobs for some students. 
 ''This school looked at this and said 'We're going to make the debate a larger conversation and dialogue,' '' Mr. Eyre said. ''This is an experience of a lifetime for them.''

 BODY:
There are 21 days to go before the presidential election, and only one more McCain-Obama debate. With time running out, the Op-Ed editors asked a few writers and thinkers to pose the last-minute questions that they have yet to hear the candidates answer.
 This week, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson announced that the federal government would purchase $250 billion in stock in America's banks. Won't the government becoming a major shareholder in banks raise the risk that lending decisions will be based more on politics than economics? What would be your administration's exit strategy for returning America's banks to full private ownership? 
 -- RICHARD SYLLA, a professor of financial history and economics at the Stern School of Business at New York University
 Most experts expect another terrorist attack on American soil, and according to recent studies, we have much more work to do to prepare ourselves against a terrorist attack using weapons of mass destruction. What steps would you take to defend the United States against such an attack?
 -- THOMAS H. KEAN and LEE H. HAMILTON, the chairman and vice chairman, respectively, of the 9/11 commission
 Last year, the federal government reported that 25,000 public schools (of 90,000) were labeled ''failing'' as a consequence of the No Child Left Behind legislation. There is growing evidence that most schools will become failing schools if the law sticks to its deadline that all children must be proficient in math and reading by 2014. One recent study published in Science magazine predicted that nearly all of California's elementary schools would fail by 2014 under current provisions of the law. How would you change the law so that it helps schools improve instead of stigmatizing them?
 -- DIANE RAVITCH, a professor of education at New York University and an assistant secretary of education from 1991 to 1993
 On Inauguration Day in January 1993, President Bill Clinton signed Executive Order 12834, which required his appointees to sign a federal ethics contract. For five years after leaving office, Clinton appointees would not lobby anyone in the agency where they had worked; lobby on behalf of any foreign government or entity that would require their registration under the Foreign Agents Registration Act of 1938; or aid or advise any foreign entity in trade negotiations. 
 However, when he left office in January 2001, Mr. Clinton revoked that order, releasing all his appointees from their contractual obligations, instantly. President Bush did not reinstate it. 
 Are you willing to reinstate Executive Order 12834 and then permanently embed its provisions into law via legislation?
 -- PAT CHOATE, the author of ''Dangerous Business'' and Ross Perot's running mate in 1996
 During the crisis between Russia and Georgia, John McCain said, ''We are all Georgians.'' But aren't we all Americans? And doesn't America have worldwide strategic interests? Are Georgia's interests more important to our long-term security than a Russia that genuinely works with the United States to eliminate nuclear weapons, control nuclear proliferation, safeguard nuclear materials and assist in the war against radical Islamic terrorism?
 -- BILL BRADLEY, a Democratic senator from New Jersey from 1979 to 1997
 Senator Obama helped pass a law in Illinois that requires the police to make audio or videotapes of interrogations of murder suspects. Would either of you require federal law-enforcement agencies to record all interrogations of witnesses as well as suspects in felony cases? And would you urge Congress to encourage recordings by state and local police departments? 
 -- PAUL EKMAN, the author of ''Telling Lies: Clues to Deceit in the Marketplace, Politics and Marriage''
 When dealing with people accused of being involved in international terrorism against the United States, what is the proper balance between the use of military proceedings and criminal trials in our courts?
 -- MARY JO WHITE, the United States attorney in Manhattan from 1993 to 2002
 Colombia has worked to eliminate terrorist activity and drug production within its borders, yet it has seen its efforts rewarded by having prominent members of the House and Senate lobby against a free trade agreement with us. What message does this send to other countries, like Afghanistan or Pakistan, that are working at our behest to eliminate security threats to both our nation and theirs?
 -- JOHN ASHCROFT, the United States attorney general from 2001 to 2005
 With the opening of the Large Hadron Collider, the center of research in physics has moved from the United States to Europe. We are producing ever fewer young American scientists -- in all fields. What specific things would you do to assure that America regains its position as the world's leader in scientific research?
 -- DAVID BALTIMORE, who shared the Nobel prize in medicine in 1975
 Should we bring greater consistency to our electoral system by mandating a uniform federal ballot to be used in all 50 states and uniform rules for voter eligibility in federal elections? 
 -- NATHANIEL PERSILY, a professor of law and political science at Columbia Law School

HEADLINE: A New Line From Apple: The Metal MacBook

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

DATELINE: CUPERTINO, Calif. 

 BODY:
Steven P. Jobs, Apple's chief executive, announced a new line of Apple laptop computers on Tuesday that he said were made with a new manufacturing process. 
 Mr. Jobs introduced new versions of the company's MacBook Pro and MacBook portable computers that are carved from 2.5-pound blocks of aluminum. 
 He said that the manufacturing process would allow Apple to build more rigid and reliable products. 
 ''We end with this remarkably precise part that now only weighs a quarter of a pound,'' said Jonathan Ive, Apple's senior vice president for design.
 Ever the showman, Mr. Jobs gave his audience of about 100 reporters, analysts and bloggers in a small auditorium on Apple's campus a tutorial on manufacturing and industrial design. At one point, he passed more than a dozen finished palm-rest frames through the audience. 
 ''It's not only incredibly light but it's very, very strong,'' he said. ''We've been working superhard to build unibody enclosures for some new notebooks.'' 
 Using blocks of aluminum as the starting point for laptop cases resolved much of the speculation among Apple enthusiasts surrounding the term ''brick.'' 
 Many of them had thought the term described an entirely new product.
 In July, the company's chief financial officer said the company would shift its business model toward lower-profit-margin products in the future. 
 Because Apple did not announce products with significantly lower prices, speculation is still centered on products in new categories. ''This is only part of the story,'' Mr. Jobs said in an interview after the news conference.
 Mr. Jobs deflected questions both on the company's financial state, saying that it would report its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings next week, and on his health. He displayed a slide showing that his blood pressure was 110 over 70, adding that questions about his health would cause his blood pressure to rise. 
 Since appearing gaunt and pale at a previous Apple introduction earlier this year, Mr. Jobs's health has been the subject of intense interest. The company and Mr. Jobs have responded by saying that he has not had a recurrence of pancreatic cancer, which he battled four years ago. 
 Mr. Jobs looked thin Tuesday, but otherwise healthy and energetic.
 Apple's challenge, industry analysts said, remains the company's ability to defy gravity if consumers begin to spend less on electronics. 
 Apple has usually been considered uniquely positioned to weather the impending crisis because its highly designed products appeal to an affluent consumer less likely to be affected by an economic downturn. But unintentionally, the company may have another advantage. A delay in refreshing its laptop product line created pent-up demand for its computers. 
 Apple says its computers account for 17.6 percent of the American retail market by volume and 31.3 percent by revenue. 
 A strong product introduction during the current quarter seems to be likely, according to a number of analysts. 
 On Monday, A. M. Sacconaghi, a securities analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, upgraded Apple's stock and predicted it would outperform the market.
 ''Apple's short-term financials are likely to remain relatively healthy despite economic weakness,'' he said.
 On Tuesday, shares of Apple rose more than $5 before falling, to end regular trading down $6.18 at $104.08. The shares were rising slightly in after-hours trading.
 Despite strong retail sales, the company's stock had been hit hard by the broader market sell-off. Apple shares dropped to as low as $88.74 last week, from $189.96 in May. 
 The company displayed an entry level $1,999 MacBook Pro model that comes with a glass touchpad to support a new set of finger gestures to control the computer, a 15.4-inch LED backlighted display and a range of other new features. 
 Apple also plans to sell a 13-inch version based on its standard MacBook line, starting at $1,299. 
 The new models are expected to go on sale in Apple's retail stores on Wednesday.
 Apple said a new version of its thin MacBook Air with 50 percent more storage would start at $1,799. The company reduced the price of its white plastic MacBook portable by just $100, to $999.
 Mr. Jobs trumpeted Apple's relationship with Nvidia, a maker of graphics processors. Several models of the new Macintosh computers will feature two graphics processors from Nvidia, which is also supplying the integrating chipset for the MacBook Pro and MacBook. 
 A new Nvidia graphics processor offers five times the graphics power of the previous Intel graphics processors in the current MacBooks, he said. 
 The shift is a significant one that raised questions about Apple's relationship with Intel, which supplies the central processing unit for the Macintosh.
 Recently Nvidia has been under increasing pressure as Intel has moved to integrate graphics processing into its products.
 ''This throws a lifeline to Nvidia,'' said Nathan Brookwood, president of Insight 64, a consulting firm.

HEADLINE: In Privacy of the Voting Booth, Race May Play a Bigger Role

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
With less than three weeks until Election Day, a big question is looming over the campaign for the White House, and it has nothing to do with the economic crisis or the caustic exchanges between Senators Barack Obama and John McCain over character and credentials. 
 It is race. 
 Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain almost never talk directly about it. In some cases, like the condemnation of the Republican ticket issued last weekend by Representative John Lewis, the Georgia Democrat who is a civil rights leader, the topic has come up openly: Mr. Lewis invoked George Wallace, the noted segregationist, in rebuking Mr. McCain as tolerating political rallies marked by crowds yelling insults and threats at Mr. Obama.
 But more often, it is found only in sentiments that are whispered, internalized or masked by discussions of culture or religion, and therefore hard to capture fully in polling or even to hear clearly in everyday conversation. 
 Political strategists once assumed that polls might well overstate support for black candidates, since white voters might be reluctant to admit racially tinged sentiments to a pollster. Newer research has cast doubt on that assumption. Either way, the situation is confounding aides on both sides, who like everyone else are waiting to see what role race will play in the privacy of the voting booth. 
 Harold Ickes, a Democrat who was the Rev. Jesse Jackson's senior adviser when he ran for president -- and who worked in the civil rights movement in the 1960s and for Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in her race against Mr. Obama this year -- said that when he looked at polls now, he routinely shaved off a point or two from Mr. Obama's number to account for hidden racial prejudices. That is no small factor, considering that Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain are separated by very thin margins in many polls in battleground states.
 ''If he were white, this would be a blowout,'' Mr. Ickes said. ''I think the country has come a long, long, long way since the 1960s. I think everybody would agree with that. But if you talk to people in certain states, they will say there are impulses that do not benefit Barack Obama because of the color of his skin.''
 Saul Anuzis, the Republican chairman in Michigan, said he had become accustomed to whispered asides from voters suggesting they would not vote for Mr. Obama because he is black. ''We honestly don't know how big an issue it is,'' Mr. Anuzis said. But Representative Artur Davis, an African-American Democrat of Alabama, said race was no longer the automatic barrier to the White House that it once was.
 ''There is a group of voters who will not vote for people who are opposite their race,'' Mr. Davis said. ''But I think that number is lower today than it has been at any point in our history. I don't believe this campaign will be decided by race; there are too many other important issues. Jesse Jackson would not have been elected in 1988. But we've changed.''
 But it is hard to tell, as Mr. Ickes and Mr. Anuzis said, to what extent voters who are opposing Mr. Obama might seize other issues -- his age and level of experience, his positions on the issues, his cultural and ideological background -- as a shield.
 And if Mr. Obama is losing support simply because he is black, that is not a one-sided equation. A crucial part of Mr. Obama's theory for winning the election is turning out blacks in places like Florida and North Carolina, a state that Mr. Obama's advisers view as in play largely because of the significant African-American population.

HEADLINE: In Debating McCain, Obama's Real Opponent Was Voter Doubt

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
The presidential debates between Senators John McCain and Barack Obama have been viewed from the outset as a match of the skills, knowledge and appeal between the new leaders of the two major political parties.
 But as Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama prepare for their third and final debate Wednesday at Hofstra University on Long Island, it appears there might be a more instructive prism through which to judge these encounters: not as a competition between two men but as a prolonged tryout for Mr. Obama.
 Unlike Mr. McCain, a fixture in American politics for nearly a generation -- he has appeared on ''Meet the Press'' 51 times, second only to Bob Dole among politicians, while Mr. Obama has appeared 8 times -- Mr. Obama entered these debates at once famous and unknown. Polls suggested that he stirred an ambiguous and slightly suspicious response from much of the public, an impression Mr. McCain has sought to encourage. 
 But every indication -- including a New York Times/CBS News poll released Tuesday that showed Mr. Obama vaulting to a significant lead -- suggests that Mr. Obama has succeeded in erasing many of those doubts, primarily through the debates.
 If that continues through the final debate, it could turn out that the Obama candidacy has become what many Democrats and had hoped and Republicans feared: a reprise of Ronald Reagan's candidacy in 1980. Mr. Reagan struggled until he met President Jimmy Carter in their only debate at the end of the campaign and voters decided they were comfortable enough with Mr. Reagan to take a chance on a relative newcomer to politics.
 ''He looks presidential,'' said Alex Castellanos, a Republican consultant who has advised Mr. McCain at times in this campaign, speaking of Mr. Obama. ''America is getting more comfortable seeing him in the ring. The more they see him, the more comfortable they've gotten.''
 In one strong indication of this, the Times/CBS News poll found that the number of people who said he had prepared himself well enough to be president had jumped to 51 percent now from 44 percent in August. And 17 percent of respondents said that Mr. Obama's debate performance had improved their opinion of him.
 Mr. McCain is highly unlikely to let this third and final debate -- the last time in the campaign that he will command an audience anywhere near this size -- pass without a fight. He said on Tuesday that he would do Wednesday what he did not do at the debate last week, which is bring up the subject of Mr. Obama's occasional interactions in Chicago with William Ayers, a former member of the Weather Underground. Setting the stage for that, Mr. McCain has turned up his advertising mentioning the ''domestic terrorist.''
 If he does, it will not be an obscure reference. The poll found that 61 percent of respondents said they had heard or read about Mr. Ayers and Mr. Obama; 9 percent volunteered his name when asked to identify an association of Mr. Obama's that bothered them.
 Still, history suggests that barring a major mistake by Mr. Obama -- who has over this year not made many -- or some startling new attack or appeal by Mr. McCain, it will be hard to erase the impressions that Mr. Obama left in the first two debates. If that is the case, he may find that he has passed the Reagan threshold. 
 Both the 1980 election and this one, presented a choice between someone who intrigued but worried voters and a familiar figure who was not particularly well liked but was viewed as experienced in the ways of Washington. In both cases, a pressing international matter was at hand -- the Iranian hostage crisis in 1980 and the threat of terrorism now -- making voters reluctant to take a chance on an unknown commodity. At the end of the 1980 campaign, though, the dam broke. And strategists in both parties think it has -- or is about to break again.
 ''Once he passed the threshold on national security, that was it,'' Robert Shrum, a Democratic consultant, said of Mr. Obama.
 But Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center, said this year was different from 1980 in one important way: While Mr. Obama has improved his standing with the American public during this campaign and the debates, Mr. McCain has hurt his. Polls show that in particular he lost ground over his response to the economic crisis and his choice of Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska as a running mate. Still, Mr. Kohut said, the comparisons with Reagan were telling.
 ''It's somewhat of a breakthrough for Obama and somewhat of a collapse for McCain,'' Mr. Kohut said. ''So it's not only people feeling better about Obama -- as it was with Reagan in 1980 -- but also people feeling less comfortable with McCain.''
 Another difference between the two campaigns is that in 1980, there was just one debate, and it took place the Thursday before Election Day. ''The race held to the end,'' said Tad Devine, a Democratic consultant. ''And than the debate happened and boom -- it just moved. ''
 This time, the final debate of three is three weeks before Election Day, meaning that the shift to Mr. Obama has been more gradual and that Mr. McCain has, at least in theory, time to recover. 
 ''But I think this time, after the next debate, people will feel that they've seen enough and make their decision,'' Mr. Devine said.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and MEGAN THEE; Marjorie Connelly and Marina Stefan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The McCain campaign's recent angry tone and sharply personal attacks on Senator Barack Obama appear to have backfired and tarnished Senator John McCain more than their intended target, the latest New York Times/CBS News poll has found.
 After several weeks in which the McCain campaign unleashed a series of strong political attacks on Mr. Obama, trying to tie him to a former 1960s radical, among other things, the poll found that more voters see Mr. McCain as waging a negative campaign than Mr. Obama. Six in 10 voters surveyed said that Mr. McCain had spent more time attacking Mr. Obama than explaining what he would do as president; by about the same number, voters said Mr. Obama was spending more of his time explaining than attacking.
 Over all, the poll found that if the election were held today, 53 percent of those determined to be probable voters said they would vote for Mr. Obama and 39 percent said they would vote for Mr. McCain.
 The findings come as the race enters its final three weeks, with the two candidates scheduled to hold their third and last debate on Wednesday night, and as separate polls in critical swing states that could decide the election give Mr. Obama a growing edge. But wide gaps in polls have historically tended to narrow in the closing weeks of the race. 
 Voters who said their opinions of Mr. Obama had changed recently were twice as likely to say they had grown more favorable as to say they had worsened. And voters who said that their views of Mr. McCain had changed were three times more likely to say that they had worsened than to say they had improved.
 The top reasons cited by those who said they thought less of Mr. McCain were his recent attacks and his choice of Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska as his running mate. (The vast majority said their opinions of Mr. Obama of Illinois, the Democratic nominee, and Mr. McCain of Arizona, the Republican nominee, had remained unchanged in recent weeks.) But in recent days, Mr. McCain and Ms. Palin have scaled back their attacks on Mr. Obama, although Mr. McCain suggested he might aggressively take on Mr. Obama in Wednesday's debate.
 With the election unfolding against the backdrop of an extraordinary economic crisis, a lack of confidence in government, and two wars, the survey described a very inhospitable environment for any Republican to run for office. More than 8 in 10 Americans do not trust the government to do what is right, the highest ever recorded in a Times/CBS News poll. And Mr. McCain is trying to keep the White House in Republican hands at a time when President Bush's job approval rating is at 24 percent, hovering near its historic low. 
 While the poll showed Mr. Obama with a 14 percentage-point lead among likely voters in a head-to-head matchup with Mr. McCain, when Ralph Nader and Bob Barr, the Libertarian candidate, were included in the question, the race narrowed slightly, with 51 percent of those surveyed saying that they were supporting Mr. Obama and 39 percent supporting Mr. McCain, with Mr. Nader getting the support of 3 percent and Mr. Barr 1 percent. Other national polls have shown Mr. Obama ahead by a smaller margin.
 The poll suggested that the overwhelming anxiety about the economy and distrust of government have created a potentially poisonous atmosphere for members of Congress. Only 43 percent of those surveyed said that they approved of their own representative's job performance, which is considerably lower than approval ratings have been at other times of historic discontent. By way of comparison, just before the Democrats lost control of Congress in 1994, 56 percent of those polled said that they approved of the job their representative was doing. 
 And after nearly eight years of increasingly unpopular Republican rule in the White House, 52 percent of those polled said that they held a favorable view of the Democratic Party, compared with 37 percent who said they held a favorable view of the Republican Party. Voters said they preferred Democrats to Republicans when it came to questions about who would better handle the issues that are of the greatest concern to voters -- including the economy, health care and the war in Iraq. 
 The nationwide telephone poll was conducted Friday through Monday with 1,070 adults, of whom 972 were registered voters, and it has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points for both groups. 
 After several weeks in which the McCain campaign sought to tie Mr. Obama to William Ayers, a founder of the Weather Underground terrorism group, 64 percent of voters said that they had either read or heard something about the subject. But a majority said they were not bothered by Mr. Obama's background or past associations. Several people said in follow-up interviews that they felt that Mr. McCain's attacks on Mr. Obama were too rooted in the past, or too unconnected to the nation's major problems. 
 ''What bothers me is that McCain initially talked about running a campaign on issues and I want to hear him talk about the issues,'' said Flavio Lorenzoni, a 59-year-old independent from Manalapan, N.J. ''But we're being constantly bombarded with attacks that aren't relevant to making a decision about what direction McCain would take the country. McCain hasn't addressed the real issues. He's only touched on them very narrowly. This is a time when we need to address issues much more clearly than they ever have been in the past.''
 The poll found that Mr. Obama is now supported by majorities of men and independents, two groups that he has been fighting to win over. And the poll found, for the first time, that white voters are just about evenly divided between Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama, who, if elected, would be the first black president. The poll found that Mr. Obama is supported by 45 percent of white voters -- a greater percentage than has voted for Democrats in recent presidential elections, according to exit polls.
 Mr. McCain was viewed unfavorably by 41 percent of voters, and favorably by 36 percent. Ms. Palin's favorability rating is now 32 percent, down 8 points from last month, and her unfavorable rating climbed nine percentage points to 41 percent. Mr. Obama's favorability rating, by contrast, is now at 50 percent, the highest recorded for him thus far by The Times and CBS News. 
 There were still some strong findings for Mr. McCain. Sixty-four percent of voters polled said Mr. McCain, 72, was well-prepared for the presidency, which has been a central theme of his campaign. Fifty-one percent said Mr. Obama, 47, was.
 But roughly 7 in 10 voters said Mr. Obama had the right kind of temperament and personality to be president; just over half said the same of Mr. McCain. 
 Mr. Obama's supporters continued to be more enthusiastic about him than Mr. McCain's supporters, the poll found, and more of those surveyed said they had confidence in Mr. Obama than in Mr. McCain to make the right decisions about the economy and health care. And while more than 6 in 10 said Mr. Obama understood the needs and problems of people like them, more than half said Mr. McCain did not.

HEADLINE: Downward Spiral

 BODY:
After years of denial and negligence, President Bush and his aides are finally waking up to the desperate mess they've made in Afghanistan. They have little choice, since the alarms are coming from all corners. 
 In a rare moment of agreement, America's 16 intelligence agencies are warning that Afghanistan is on a dangerous ''downward spiral.'' Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, is publicly predicting that next year will be an even ''tougher year.''
 As The Times reported last week, a draft intelligence report blames three problems for the breakdown in central authority and the Taliban's rising power: rampant corruption, a booming heroin trade and increasingly sophisticated attacks from militants based across the border in Pakistan. Unless all three are addressed quickly, the war in Afghanistan could be lost. 
 Under pressure from the United States and other NATO governments, Afghanistan's president, Hamid Karzai, appointed a new interior minister over the weekend who will be charged with cleaning up and strengthening the country's police force. Mr. Karzai now must cut all ties with corrupt officials. He must take a hard and credible look at allegations that his brother may be involved in the heroin trade that is pouring $100 million annually into the Taliban's coffers.
 The United States will also have to send more troops into Afghanistan and persuade its allies to send more. It's chilling to watch America's defense secretary, Robert Gates, begging NATO -- and the White House -- for help. Germany's commitment of another 1,000 troops is commendable but marred by its refusal to deploy them in southern Afghanistan where the fighting is heaviest. NATO members that can't or won't send more troops must contribute money to build Afghanistan's national army and finance local development.
 NATO's recent decision to authorize its forces to go after drug lords and drug labs is a (much belated) start, but it still has far too many strings attached. 
 The Bush administration must drop its resistance to working with tribal leaders to fight the Taliban. The time for worrying about undermining President Karzai is long past. Reconciliation talks should also be explored with members of the Taliban -- if they forsake violence. 
 Washington must also come up with a better mixture of incentives and pressures to persuade Pakistan to shut down Taliban and Al Qaeda havens. The country's new civilian leaders and army chief say that they understand the threat posed by militants and are willing to fight them. That must be encouraged, including with more carefully monitored military and economic aid. 
 Imagine if Mr. Bush had not invaded Iraq in 2003 and instead put all of this country's resources and attention into defeating Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan. Even optimistic analysts say that things have now gotten so bad that, with the best strategy, it could take another 5 to 10 years to stabilize Afghanistan. 
 That is one more reason why the next president must plot a swift, orderly exit from Iraq and begin a swift and serious buildup of troops and aid in Afghanistan -- the real frontline in the war on terror.

HEADLINE: A Winner for Treasury? Time Will Tell

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
The Treasury Department will make substantial profits on its investments in banks under the bailout program announced Tuesday -- if the banks return to health within a few years. If not, the government could end up breaking even, or perhaps even lose money.
 In a number of ways, Washington's proposal comes with fewer strings attached than the rescue plans in European countries. That would seem to place the American government at a disadvantage, but Washington could benefit if that relative leniency helps banks recover quickly and provides a big profit on the equity stake it is receiving. 
 Whereas some European plans barred banks from paying dividends on common stock until the government got its money back and demanded promises that the banks would keep loans flowing to businesses and individuals, Washington allowed the banks that it invests in to continue paying dividends on existing common and preferred shares.
 In addition, while European banks are being required in some cases to put government representatives on their boards, the American government will not receive board seats or have voting power.
 Those differences were reflected in stock market reactions on Tuesday. Shares in the British banks that are being partially nationalized fell, as investors adjusted to the fact that it could be years before dividend payments are resumed. Share prices in American banks generally continued to rise as details of the Treasury's plan became known.
 Under the American plan, the government is guaranteeing new loans to banks -- and planning to collect a fee for doing so -- and it is planning to invest $250 billion by buying preferred stock from banks. That stock will come with warrants that give the government a chance to earn big profits if share prices recover.
 The American plan provides both a carrot and a stick to encourage banks to repay the government as soon as possible with money they raised by selling shares to private investors. 
 The carrot allows banks to cut in half the number of common shares the government will eventually be able to purchase. That can be done if a bank sells stock by the end of 2009, and raises at least as much cash as the government is investing.
 ''If they can replace government capital with private capital, there will be much less dilution to existing shareholders,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG. ''That is important to current shareholders.''
 Meeting that 2009 deadline may be a challenge. Economies in the United States, Europe and Japan appear to be in recession, and many economists think the declines will continue well into 2009. The extent to which banks will be able to regain investor confidence before the economy recovers -- reducing the number of loans that are not being paid -- is open to question.
 The stick comes from the terms of the preferred stock. For the first five years, the Treasury will receive 5 percent interest, a rate not too far above what the government itself was paying to borrow a few months ago before financial panic caused investors to gobble up Treasuries as a way to avoid risk.
 After five years, if a bank has not been able to repay the government, that interest rate will leap to 9 percent, and stay there until the money is paid back. There is no deadline for the repayment, but the government may sell its stake to private investors, assuming there are any who wish to buy it.
 One important determinant of how well the American government does financially will be whether it makes wise choices regarding which banks to invest in. It has not promised to let all banks into the program, and it has not announced the criteria it will use.
 Should banks fail despite the capital injection, the Treasury would be likely to lose most, if not all, of its investment. The government would be treated the same as other preferred stockholders, who generally suffer major losses in bank failures.
 Another possible break for the banks is that the exercise price for the warrants will be the average common share price for the 20 days before the government makes its investment. That means that the price will reflect investor knowledge of the plan. If it continues to be favorably received by investors, that could mean the banks get higher prices for their shares than they would if the price were fixed today.
 One index of regional bank stocks has risen 10 percent this week, with some banks that had been deemed among the most vulnerable doing even better. 
 The government will receive warrants equal to 15 percent of its investment. For a bank that gets a capital infusion of $10 billion, that would mean the government could buy $1.5 billion of common stock. If that bank had an average share price of $20 a share during the period before the deal was concluded, that would give the government the right to buy 75 million shares at that price.
 If the stock was trading at $30 a share when the warrant was exercised, that would give the government a profit of $750 million.
 However, if the bank managed to raise $10 billion in a stock offering before the end of next year, the government would only be able to exercise warrants for half the shares, or 37.5 million in this example. That would cut the government's possible profit in half.
 In some cases, smaller banks will get a sweeter deal. If the preferred shares are issued by a bank holding company, they must be cumulative, meaning that if the company misses a dividend it must eventually make it up. But individual banks not in holding companies, generally smaller institutions, will be allowed to issue noncumulative preferred stock. Such companies could halt dividends for one or more quarters, and then resume them without having to make up the missed dividends.
 Only if a bank has missed dividends for one and a half years would the government be able to claim spots on the board.
 By forcing nine major banks to ''volunteer'' for the program, and by making it possible for them to suffer relatively little dilution if they can reassure investors by the end of next year, the Treasury Department hoped to remove any stigma that would be attached to participating in the program.
 How well it succeeded will become clear as more banks announce that they have signed up and receive capital infusions. If markets react by bidding up the share prices of those banks, the Treasury will have scored an early victory.
 But the final verdict will not be rendered until all the money has been repaid, or lost. At best, that number will not be known for several years.

HEADLINE: Volunteers for Obama Face a Complex Issue

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Rebecca Cathcart contributed reporting from Los Angeles.

DATELINE: ELKO, Nev. 

 BODY:
On a recent evening here in eastern Nevada, Cathy Vance, a volunteer for the presidential campaign of Senator Barack Obama, went knocking on doors of voters who had been identified as potential Obama supporters. Elko County is largely rural, with few black residents, located in a state with a dearth of black elected officials. 
 Among the people she found that night was Veronica Mendive, who seemed cautiously warming to Mr. Obama's candidacy. But she had a thought. 
 ''I don't want to sound like I'm prejudiced,'' Ms. Mendive said. ''I've never been around a lot of black people before. I just worry that they're nice to your face but then when they get around their own people you just have to worry about what they're going to do to you.''
 Ms. Vance responded: ''One thing you have to remember is that Obama, he's half white and he was raised by his white mother. So his views are more white than black really.'' She went on to assure Ms. Mendive that she was so impressed with Mr. Obama the person, that she failed to notice the color of his skin anymore. 
 The exchange, posted on The Caucus blog on nytimes.com, evoked outrage among many readers. ''Amazing how even white people who support Obama and are canvassing for him default to classic white supremacist language,'' wrote one reader. 
 Another said, ''What in the world is this volunteer thinking?''
 But Ms. Vance's efforts reflect the complex task that many volunteers canvassing for Mr. Obama face. While she and other Obama volunteers may feel offended by remarks like Ms. Mendive's, an admonishment would not persuade a voter on the fence to pull the lever for Mr. Obama. So she often takes another tack.
 ''I meet people like that from time to time,'' Ms. Vance said later. She described one woman she met who explained that she knew herself to be ''prejudiced,'' had come to abhor that quality in herself, and also saw it reflected through her young son, ''who she said was full of hate,'' Ms. Vance explained.
 ''We sat and talked at her kitchen table for a long time that day,'' Ms. Vance recalled. ''I tried to explain to her that maybe the only way to heal those years of hatred and prejudice was to finally make the move and vote for Obama.'' 
 David W. Nickerson, a professor of political science at Notre Dame who studies campaign voter outreach, called it unusual for someone to admit racial bias to a stranger. A person from the community where the voter lives might be more persuasive on racial issues, he said. 
 ''If you were going to persuade someone on an issue like race,'' Professor Nickerson said, ''I'd imagine that it would have to come from a credible source. Having it come from someone you know or someone from your neighborhood that represents.''
 Darry A. Sragow, a political consultant based in Los Angeles who has worked on various Democratic campaigns, said volunteers were generally trained to ''shift the discussion from anything that sounds like it may be race-based to arguments that are working best for the Obama campaign, like the economy.'' 
 He added: ''It's like selling a car. You're not going to convince them it's a beautiful car if they think its ugly. But you get back to whatever the strongest points are. You don't get far trying to convince someone that something they think of as negative is positive.''
 Another person who posted a comment in response to the nytimes.com blog item from Elko wrote: ''I'm canvassing for Obama. If this issue comes up, even if obliquely, I emphasize that Obama is from a multiracial background and that his father was an African intellectual, not an American from the inner city. I explain that Obama has never aligned himself solely with African-American interests -- not on any issue -- but rather has always sought to find a middle ground.''

HEADLINE: Drama Behind a Banking Deal

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and ERIC DASH; Mark Landler reported from Washington, and Eric Dash from New York. Louise Story and Ben White contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The chief executives of the nine largest banks in the United States trooped into a gilded conference room at the Treasury Department at 3 p.m. Monday. To their astonishment, they were each handed a one-page document that said they agreed to sell shares to the government, then Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. said they must sign it before they left.
The chairman of JPMorgan Chase, Jamie Dimon, was receptive, saying he thought the deal looked pretty good once he ran the numbers through his head. The chairman of Wells Fargo, Richard M. Kovacevich, protested strongly that, unlike his New York rivals, his bank was not in trouble because of investments in exotic mortgages, and did not need a bailout, according to people briefed on the meeting.
But by 6:30, all nine chief executives had signed -- setting in motion the largest government intervention in the American banking system since the Depression and retreating from the rescue plan Mr. Paulson had fought so hard to get through Congress only two weeks earlier. 
What happened during those three and a half hours is a story of high drama and brief conflict, followed by acquiescence by the bankers, who felt they had little choice but to go along with the Treasury plan to inject $250 billion of capital into thousands of banks -- starting with theirs.
Mr. Paulson announced the plan Tuesday, saying ''we regret having to take these actions.'' Pouring billions in public money into the banks, he said, was ''objectionable,'' but unavoidable to restore confidence in the markets and persuade the banks to start lending again.
In addition to the capital infusions, which will be made this week, the government said it would temporarily guarantee $1.5 trillion in new senior debt issued by banks, as well as insure $500 billion in deposits in noninterest-bearing accounts, mainly used by businesses.
All told, the potential cost to the government of the latest bailout package comes to $2.25 trillion, triple the size of the original $700 billion rescue package, which centered on buying distressed assets from banks. The latest show of government firepower is an abrupt about-face for Mr. Paulson, who just days earlier was discouraging the idea of capital injections for banks.
Analysts say the United States was forced to shift policy in part because Britain and other European countries announced plans to recapitalize their banks and backstop bank lending. But unlike in Britain, the Treasury secretary presented his plan as an offer the banks could not refuse.
''It was a take it or take it offer,'' said one person who was briefed on the meeting, speaking on condition of anonymity because the discussions were private. ''Everyone knew there was only one answer.''
Getting to that point, however, necessitated sometimes tense exchanges between Mr. Paulson, a onetime chairman of Goldman Sachs, and his former colleagues and competitors, who sat across a dark wood table from him, sipping coffee and Cokes under a soaring rose and sage green ceiling.
This account is based on interviews with government officials and bank executives who attended the meeting or were briefed on it.
Mr. Paulson began calling the bankers personally Sunday afternoon. Some were already in Washington for a meeting of the International Monetary Fund.
The executives did not have an inkling of Mr. Paulson's plans. Some speculated that he would brief them about the government's latest bailout program, or perhaps sound them out about a voluntary initiative. No one expected him to present his plan as an ultimatum.
Mr. Paulson, according to his own account, presented his case in blunt terms. The nation's largest banks needed to begin lending to each other for the good of the financial system, he said in a telephone interview, recalling his remarks. To do that, they needed to be better capitalized.
''I don't think there was any banker in that room who was going to look us in the eye and say they had too much capital,'' Mr. Paulson said. ''In a relatively short period of time, people came on board.''
Indeed, several of the banks represented in the room are in need of capital. And analysts said the terms of the government's investment are attractive for the banks, certainly compared with the terms that Warren E. Buffett extracted from Goldman Sachs for his $5 billion investment.
The Treasury will receive preferred shares that pay a 5 percent dividend, rising to 9 percent after five years. It will get warrants to purchase common shares, equivalent to 15 percent of its initial investment. But the Treasury said it would not exercise its right to vote those common shares.
The terms, officials said, were devised so as not to be punitive. The rising dividend and the warrants are meant to give banks an incentive to raise private capital and buy out the government after a few years. Still, it took some cajoling.
Mr. Kovacevich of Wells Fargo objected that his bank, based in San Francisco, had avoided the mortgage-related woes of its Wall Street rivals. He said the investment could come at the expense of his shareholders.
Mr. Kovacevich is also said to have expressed concern about restrictions on executive compensation at banks that receive capital injections. If he steps down from Wells Fargo after completing a planned takeover of Wachovia, he would be entitled to retirement benefits worth about $43 million, and $140 million in accumulated stock and options, according to James F. Reda & Associates, a executive pay consulting firm. Pay experts say the new Treasury limits would probably not affect his exit package.
Mr. Kovacevich declined to be interviewed about the meeting.
Kenneth D. Lewis, the chairman of Bank of America, also pushed back, saying his bank had just raised $10 billion on its own. Later, Mr. Lewis urged his colleagues not to quibble with the plan's restrictions on executive compensation for the top executives. These include a ban on the payment of golden parachutes, repayment of any bonus based on earnings that prove to be inaccurate, and a limit of $500,000 on the tax deductibility of salaries.
If we let executive compensation block this, ''we are out of our minds,'' he said, according to a person briefed on the meeting.
In an interview on Monday, before the meeting, John J. Mack said his bank, Morgan Stanley, did not need capital from the Treasury. It had just sealed a $9 billion deal with a large Japanese bank. During the meeting, Mr. Mack, Morgan Stanley's chief executive, said little, according to participants.
Mr. Paulson, however, was peppered with questions about the terms of the investment by other chief executives with experience in deal-making: Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, Vikram S. Pandit of Citigroup, John A. Thain of Merrill Lynch and Mr. Dimon.
Among their concerns were: How would the government's stake affect other preferred shareholders? Would the Treasury Department demand some control over management in return for the capital? How would the warrants work?
With the discussion becoming heated, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, who was seated next to Mr. Paulson, interceded. He told the bankers that the session need not be combative, since both the banks and the broader economy stood to benefit from the program. Without such measures, he added, the situation of even healthy banks could deteriorate.
The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Timothy F. Geithner, then proceeded to outline the details of the investment program. When the bankers heard the amount of money the government planned to invest, they were stunned by its size, according to several people.
As they heard more of the details, some of the bankers began to realize how attractive the program was for them.
Even as they insisted that they did not need the money, bankers recognized that the extra capital could be helpful if the economy became shakier. Besides, many of these banks' biggest businesses are tied to the stock and credit markets; the quicker they improve, the better their results.
Later, Mr. Pandit told colleagues that the investment would give Citigroup more flexibility to borrow and lend. Mr. Dimon told colleagues he believed the relatively cheap capital was a fair deal for his bank. Mr. Lewis said he recognized the prospects of his bank were closely aligned with the American economy.
Mr. Thain was intrigued by the terms of the guarantee by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation on new senior debt issued by banks, participants said. He mentally calculated the maturities on debt issued by Merrill Lynch, to determine how the program could benefit his bank.
For Mr. Paulson, selling the bankers on capital injections may not have been as difficult as overhauling a rescue program that had originally focused on asset purchases from banks. In the interview, Mr. Paulson said the worsening conditions made a change in focus imperative.
''I've always said to everyone that ever worked for me, if you get too dug in on a position, the facts change, and you don't change to adapt to the facts, you will never be successful,'' he said in the interview.
Mr. Paulson insisted that purchases of distressed assets would remain a big part of the program. But having allocated $250 billion to direct investments, the Treasury has only $100 billion left from its initial allotment of $350 billion from Congress to spend on those purchases.
As the meeting wound down, participants said, the bankers focused more on contacting their boards before signing the agreement with the Treasury Department. With time running short and private space limited, some of the bankers left the Treasury building, heading for their limousines while speaking urgently into cellphones.
''I don't think we need to be talking about this a whole lot more,'' Mr. Lewis said, according to a person briefed on the meeting. ''We all know that we are going to sign.''

(PHOTOGRAPH BY MARK WILSON/GETTY IMAGES) (pg.A25) CHART: Investing in banks The government is investing $250 billion in senior preferred bank stock, under the following conditions: Half has been invested in nine large banks
half will be available to thousands of small and regional banks. The investments count toward each bank's base, or Tier 1, capital ratio. The minimum investment will be 1 percent of risk-weighted assets
 the maximum will be up to $25 billion or 3 percent of risk-weighted assets, whichever is less. Banks will pay dividends of 5 percent on the investments for the first five years. If the banks have not paid back the investments by then, the rate will jump to 9 percent. Banks may not pay dividends on other stock until dividends have been paid to the government. The government will not have voting rights, except on matters that may adversely affect the investments, but it will be able to appoint directors if a company misses six quarters of dividends. The preferred stock may be paid back after three years at face value. Alternatively, during that time, the banks may pay back the investments at face value with money raised from outside investors. The government may sell the preferred stock to a third-party. INCREASING THE INVESTMENT The government will have warrants allowing it to buy 15 percent of the value of its senior preferred investments in common stock. The price will be based on market prices in the weeks before the government made its investment. If a bank is able to raise an equal amount of capital from investors by the end of 2009, the government will be able to exercise only half its warrants. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION Banks that have received government investments will limit compensation of the top five executives and will limit golden parachutes for those executives. Executives who are compensated based on company performance that is later found to be inaccurate will have to forfeit that compensation. Compensation over $500,000 cash will not be tax-deductible for the company. Extending federal deposit insurance The F.D.I.C. has guaranteed senior debt issued by all banks that it insures through June 30, 2009. The F.D.I.C. has guaranteed the deposits of all noninterest-bearing accounts through Dec. 31, 2009. These accounts are primarily used by businesses to meet payroll and other continuing expenses. Buying commercial paper The Federal Reserve will be able to buy commercial paper with a three-month maturity issued by companies with investment-grade credit ratings.

HEADLINE: Tap Water's Popularity Forces Pepsi To Cut Jobs

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
Tap water is making a comeback. That's bad news for PepsiCo's profits.
 The company, which makes Pepsi, Doritos and Quaker Oats cereal, announced on Tuesday that its quarterly earnings were down 10 percent in part because of declines in sales of soda and bottled water in the United States. 
 In response, the company is planning to eliminate 3,300 jobs and close as many as six plants to cut costs and to refocus its efforts on stabilizing its domestic beverage business. 
 ''Revitalizing this business is a huge priority for us,'' said PepsiCo's chief executive, Indra Nooyi.
 Pepsi reported net income of $1.58 billion for the third quarter, compared with $1.74 billion a year earlier. Excluding losses related to commodity hedges, the company's earnings were $1.06 per share. Analysts surveyed by ThomsonReuters were expecting $1.08 per share.
 The company's stock price dropped $7.37 to close at $54.40 on Tuesday. The stock has fallen 28 percent since the beginning of the year, most of that in the last two weeks. PepsiCo's stock on Oct. 1 was $71.64.
 Sales of carbonated soft drinks have been declining in the United States for several years, as consumers turn to a growing number of new beverages like enhanced waters, sports drinks and energy drinks. But the problems have accelerated in a volatile economy, with consumers eating at restaurants less and buying fewer grab-and-go beverages.
 In addition, consumers are increasingly choosing tap water over other beverages at restaurants and at home to help save money and the environment, according to PepsiCo and industry analysts. Research by William Pecoriello, an analyst at Morgan Stanley, found that 34 percent of consumers say they are reusing plastic bottles more often and 23 percent say they are cutting back on bottled beverages in favor of tap water or beverages in containers that create less waste.
 Information Resources, a research firm, found that sales of water filters increased 16 percent in the first half of the year.
 PepsiCo said volume for beverages in North America declined by 4 percent in the third quarter, which ended in Sept. 6. 
 In recent years, noncarbonated beverages were an engine of growth as soda sales slipped, but no longer. Volume for noncarbonated beverage sales dropped 5 percent in the quarter, led by double-digit declines in Aquafina and Propel, a flavored and vitamin-enhanced water drink.
 Carbonated soft drink volume in North America declined by 3 percent in the quarter.
 In response, PepsiCo is creating new packaging and logos for many beverages, and plans to introduce new products in the coming year.
 ''Because of the economy, there is some movement, probably temporarily, back to tap water,'' said John Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest, an industry publication. He predicted that both PepsiCo and Coca-Cola would ratchet up their efforts to improve beverage sales in 2009.
 ''Unless both Pepsi and Coke do something quickly, they could lose a generation of carbonated soft drink consumers,'' Mr. Sicher said.
 To increase sales in the United States, Ms. Nooyi said, would take a ''breakthrough'' product. Both Pepsi and Coke are hoping for a breakthrough when they introduce beverages that use a natural, low-calorie sweetener derived from the stevia plant.
 Despite the lackluster beverage sales in North America, Ms. Nooyi said international growth remained robust, particularly in the Middle East, India and China. Revenue for PepsiCo's food businesses in the North America grew by 12 percent in the quarter, and profit increased by 9 percent.

HEADLINE: Canada's Conservatives Miss Goal of a Legislative Majority

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

DATELINE: OTTAWA 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Stephen Harper's gamble that forcing the country into its third election in four years would give him firm control over Parliament failed on Tuesday. While his Conservative Party improved its results over the last election, it still fell short of a majority in the House of Commons, according to unofficial and incomplete tallies.
 The Conservatives were projected to have picked up 19 additional seats, giving them a total of 145. But that was still 10 shy of the majority Mr. Harper needed to pass legislation without the help of opposition parties. 
 Speaking to supporters early Wednesday morning in his hometown, Calgary, Alberta, even as numbers continued to shift slightly, he said, ''The voters have entrusted us with a strengthened mandate to continue to lead the government and take Canada forward.'' He continued, ''We have shown that minority government can work, and at this time of global economic instability we owe it to all Canadians to show it again.''
 A clear loser in the election was the opposition Liberal Party, whose membership in Parliament apparently dropped to 75 seats from 103. Though he conceded defeat, the Liberals' leader, Stephane Dion, gave no indication that he would step down.
 After taking power in 2006, Mr. Harper set a fixed election date of October 2009, an idea introduced with much fanfare, but abandoned last month when he called this election. It appeared that he was relying on the strong economy, as well as disarray in the Liberal Party, to secure the parliamentary majority he was denied in the last election, in January 2006. 
 Mr. Harper was blindsided, however, by the recent turmoil in financial markets. Canada's banks have avoided the troubles experienced in the United States and Europe, but the Toronto Stock Exchange has gyrated with its counterparts elsewhere. 
 If anything, Mr. Harper made an undesirable situation even worse for his party by projecting an attitude of nonchalance. 
 During a debate, he found himself on the defensive after saying, ''What Canadians are worried about right now is not the job situation, not losing their home like in the U.S.'' Their concerns, he said, were limited to their investments.
 Later, in a television interview, he suggested that the world's economic problems might not be all bad. ''I think there are probably some gains to be made in the stock market,'' Mr. Harper said.
 Canadians do not vote directly for a political party or the prime minister, but elect a local member of the House of Commons, the lower house of Parliament. 
 For Mr. Harper to achieve a majority in Parliament, it was essential for him to expand from his base in Western Canada and substantially improve his party's standing in Ontario and Quebec, which control 181 of the 308 seats. 
 The current economic uncertainty has been a particular concern in parts of Ontario where industries rely heavily on exports to the United States. 
 A rise in the value of the Canadian dollar over the last two years made many of those factories much less competitive. The economic slowdown in the United States has only aggravated the problem.
 Peter Donolo, a former official in a Liberal government who now is an executive at the Strategic Counsel, a polling firm, said the perception of Mr. Harper in Quebec reversed during the campaign, from 60 percent approval to 60 percent disapproval.
 ''The support just evaporated,'' Mr. Donolo said. ''He chased away Quebec votes kind of off-handedly.''
 French-speaking Quebecers reacted poorly to suggestions by Mr. Harper that artists were members of the elite who spent too much time at government-financed galas. A proposal to stiffen penalties for young people who commit crimes also found little following in the province.
 The collapse of the Conservatives in Quebec helped the separatist Bloc Quebecois, which had been written off by some of its supporters as the election began, retain 48 of the 51 seats it won in 2006.
 But the Liberal campaign had its share of problems. The party was led for the first time by Mr. Dion, a former academic. He has vigorously opposed Quebec separatism, which made him unpopular in many parts of his home province. His often peculiar English sometimes made him difficult to understand.
 The Liberals' biggest problem was the key element of their platform. Mr. Dion proposed controlling greenhouse gas emissions by introducing a carbon tax on all fossil fuels except gasoline. 
 Under Mr. Dion's plan, the revenue would be used to reduce income taxes. The Conservatives relentlessly attacked the plan as a tax grab.
 Adding to Mr. Dion's woes was the resurgence of two other left-of-center parties. The New Democratic Party, supported by organized labor and led by Jack Layton, won 37 seats, according to incomplete results, up from 29. 
 The Green Party had an unusually high profile during the campaign, but won no seats.

HEADLINE: A Currency as Sound as a Slim-Fit Shirt

BYLINE: By MIKE ALBO

 BODY:
I HAVE rarely seen someone as crazy and as determined as the Italian mother who jostled me in the Gap flagship store in Midtown. She bumped into me as she snatched up a pair of tan cargo pants. She went over to her teenage son and threw them at him. He exhaled furiously -- the international sign for ''God, Mom, whatever!'' -- and went to the dressing room. Then, to my right, a Frenchman wheeled a baby carriage onto my foot until I moved out of his way. 
 There must have been 100 Europeans in this store: men wearing sweaters tied around their shoulders, women wearing sunglasses inside, entire families chattering and pointing. All of them had rapacious looks in their eyes because they knew time is money. They needed to buy as much as possible before the increasingly global financial meltdown turned their powerful euros into a currency as pathetic as, well, the United States dollar. 
 But ... Gap? At first it was difficult to understand why the Eurofolk were so intense about this place. It leaves the bland taste of the 1990s in my mouth. I see the square blue sign, and it calls to mind Helen Hunt on ''Mad About You,'' sitting on a puffy couch in comfy khakis and a big, shapeless chambray shirt, holding a huge mug of tea with both hands. When Gap was at its peak of influence, Seinfeld was a style icon. Blech.
 But Gap is on a mission to lure us back, hiring the sharp, youthful designer Patrick Robinson to revamp the line. His designs started showing up in stores last spring. Maybe the Eurofolk are on to something. 
 Walking into the giant store, I could see the revamping effort. The space was brightly lighted, cool music was playing, huge photos of Hugh Dancy and the sexily scarred hockey star Sean Avery were on the walls, and the mannequins wore hip outfits in layered combinations I wanted to wear -- especially one tweed jacket, sleeves pushed up. 
 A lot of the merchandise invites you to try it on right there on the floor, like a warm charcoal cable knit cardigan ($138), a leather bomber ($298) or a hip-length cargo jacket on sale for $49.99. This was a total of about 360 euros, and if I were a literature grad student visiting from Strasbourg, I would have bought all three and then gone home and worn them while smoking loose tobacco cigarettes and reading Houellebecq. 
 Mixed in with those updated items were some gross familiars from yesteryear: baseball hats with the word GAP sewn on the front ($16.50) and khaki cargo pants with lumpy thigh pockets ($44.50). One look at those items and I wanted to breathe into a paper bag. 
 But then I slipped on the gray tweed blazer ($108). Unfortunately it bunched up at the shoulders and looked a little less svelte on me. I selected a bunch of other garments to try on and headed back to the dressing rooms. 
 In the big bright room, I could tell the clothes had Mr. Robinson's touch. A T-shirt ($16.50) in an emerald color had a nice bicep-hugging upper body. A pair of slim-fit dress pants ($68) would look clean and impressive on a first date. A white button-down fit adequately, and for $39.50, it was a perfect purchase for someone who works in catering or an office and needs at least to pretend to care about his job. I liked the way a cashmere V-neck fit (on sale for $29.90), although it had a strange seam along the sides as if it were inside out.
 Before I made any decisions, I went to Gap Kids on the top floor to scout for future Kooky Uncle Mike gifts. Boy's crew-neck waffle shirts were on sale, two for $25. In Baby Gap a cute cotton cable-knit pullover was $34.50, and an adorable tweed toggle coat with a wool-lined hood was $54.50. Perfectly dressed mannequins appeared amid the racks and tables, as well as illuminated photos of happy children in quirky poses. As everywhere in the store, I found the sales clerks busy folding and helping out customers -- they seemed helpful, alert and in surprisingly good moods.
 IN the women's section on the second floor, two Spanish ladies gesticulated wildly over a trench coat, while four women who seemed to be from an exotic cash-rich country known as Texas had exhausted themselves with browsing. ''Whooee, I'm going to sit down right here,'' one of them in big gold earrings said. (Gap astutely placed the women's and kid's sections on the upper levels, understanding that most men will exert as much effort browsing for clothing as it takes them to open a bottle of beer.)
 As on the first floor, the mannequins were puzzlingly stylish and sexy. The female form displayed by Gap Body, the brand's line of soft, cottony feminine warm-up styles, looked like a shapely yogic zombie of Christy Turlington, still walking after she was beheaded. Somehow, the striped henley she had on looked gorgeously fitted. 
 Upon closer inspection, I realized that the mannequin's shirt was tucked in the back to give it the illusion of a slimmer fit. I ran downstairs to the male mannequins. Nearly all of the garments were meticulously gathered into a pleat in the back, even the tweed jacket I had tried on. I pulled at the jacket and the form went from svelte to normal in two tugs. 
 I've noticed this tactic in other stores: clipping or tucking the clothes to make the garments seem as if they are gloriously tailored, and it always drives me crazy. It is my hope that during the next presidential administration I can form the Truth in Visual Merchandising Commission and put an end to this travesty. Be warned, retailers: End this deceitful practice now! Either stop clipping or tucking your clothes, or get fatter mannequins! 
 Even so, I ended up buying two slim-fit shirts: a light blue oxford for $39.50 and a plaid button-down on sale for only $12.97. They actually fit nicely on my human-shape torso. Then, I walked out onto Fifth Avenue, crowded with European shoppers, and listened to the lilting cadences of the many Romance languages. I bet all of them were talking about the exchange rate.
 Gap 680 Fifth Avenue (54th Street); (212) 977-7023.
 BIG STORE The huge, bustling Fifth Avenue flagship for the newly updated (but still dependably generic) brand of cheap clothing basics.
 LITTLE EUROPE There are few people in this neighborhood with a United States passport, so take a promenade up and down Fifth Avenue and feel displaced in your own country. Why go to Europe?
 WIDE SMILES Delete the old SNL skit. At least at this store, the employees are cute, young and friendly.

HEADLINE: Banks Brace for Slump As Economy Weakens

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH

 BODY:
JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and State Street have weathered these bad times better than most banks. But things are about to get worse. 
 Sobered by the prospect of a drawn-out erosion in the economy, investors drove down the shares of all three Wednesday even after they reported earnings that beat the low expectations of Wall Street analysts. 
 ''If you made it past the credit crisis, you are not making it past the economic carnage,'' said Meredith A. Whitney, a banking analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. ''And there is more to come.'' 
 The banks are among the first to announce their results in what is expected to be yet another dismal quarter for nearly all financial firms. Bank of America already reported disappointing earnings as it struggled to raise $10 billion in fresh capital. And Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, PNC Financial, and Bank of New York Mellon are expected to release weak results on Thursday, followed by regional and small banks whose fortunes have been changed by the upheaval of the American financial landscape.
 Profit at JPMorgan Chase slumped 84 percent, to $527 million, or 11 cents a share, in the third quarter as the bank weathered losses of $3.6 billion on bad investments, leveraged loans and a bevy of unusual charges, including ones tied to its takeover of Washington Mutual last month. In a sign it is preparing for more fallout from a contracting economy, the bank set aside another $2.2 billion to cover current and future losses on credit card, mortgages and commercial real estate loans.
 Wells Fargo & Company said profit fell 25 percent, to $1.64 billion, or 49 cents a share, after absorbing big losses on investments in Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Lehman Brothers. It also bolstered its reserves by $2.5 billion as it braces for higher loan losses, and will soon inherit tens of billions in new losses from its takeover of Wachovia. 
 At State Street Corporation, a custodial bank based in Boston, profit rose 33 percent, to $477 million, or $1.09 a share, as it booked higher trading fees amid volatile markets. But it, too, faced heavy losses on investments, including loan collateral from Lehman Brothers. It also may need to set aside as much as $450 million to prop up some of its battered investors in its fixed-income funds. 
 The banks were among the nine firms compelled by Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. on Tuesday to take a big cash infusion from the government. Both JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo agreed to received $25 billion investments; State Street, which has a much smaller balance sheet, received about $2 billion. Though all of the firms denied needing the money, federal officials hope they use it to increase lending.
 Even if the flow of credit improves soon, executives are planning for a future shaped by thousands of lost jobs in the economy, weaker consumer spending and more market turmoil and uncertainty. ''We necessarily need to be prepared for a bad environment,'' said Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's chairman and chief executive. 
 With losses on housing far worse than anticipated, he said the bank was ''getting braced'' to increase its reserves against losses on loans over the next couple of quarters, and for ''very tough'' trading results. The finance chief, Michael J. Cavanagh, said the bank believed the economy was already experiencing ''recessionary conditions'' that would worsen. 
 On Wednesday, Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, warned that the American economy was headed toward an extended period of difficulty in spite of a worldwide effort to stabilize the markets. Investors, fearful that the worst is still to come, sent financial stocks plummeting. The KBW Index, a popular measure of the sector, fell more than 7 percent on Wednesday. It is down more than 45 percent since last year. 
 A continued contraction may make it even tougher for consumers to pay off loans, especially credit card and auto debt, creating another layer of risk.
 And banks are also being hurt by narrower lending margins. Without the volume of new business, banks will find it especially challenging to be profitable. ''Profit pressure is picking up at a time when you are trying to build it up as fast as you can to handle these credit problems,'' said Gerard Cassidy, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets.
 Wells Fargo's chief financial officer, Howard I. Atkins, warned that the bank faced intense pressure on its huge consumer loan portfolio. He cited weakness in residential real estate, rising unemployment and increases in bankruptcies. 
 JPMorgan outlined signs of strain already showing up in its big consumer businesses. Its Chase retail banking operations reported $247 million in net income, a 61 percent drop from the period last year. It has pulled back on new lending, tightening standards on mortgages and home equity loans. And Chase's big credit card division reported $292 million in net income, a 63 percent drop from last year. The unit took a $2.2 billion write-down to buffer against potential losses, as more consumers struggled to pay their credit card balances.
 ''Credit has deteriorated meaningfully this quarter, and it is going to get worse before it gets better,'' Mr. Cassidy said. ''That is going to continue to drive the results well into 2009.'' 
 Mr. Dimon, on a conference call with analysts, said he expected lending to return to normal eventually. But now, he added, is the time to be prudent. ''We are not going to say, 'Yahoo, this is over,' and go extend credit like we did without fear,'' he said. ''If you are not fearful, you are crazy.''
 Ms. Whitney, one of the most bearish banking analysts on the call, shot back, ''I'm fearful, thanks.''
 Mr. Dimon deadpanned: ''We know you are. We are waiting for you to reverse your position.''

HEADLINE: Back to The Blitz

BYLINE: By ANDREW O'HAGAN. 
Andrew O'Hagan is the author of three novels and ''The Atlantic Ocean: Essays on Britain and America.''

DATELINE: London 

 BODY:
 IF one is willing to wait long enough, the looniest books can come to seem like masterpieces of common sense. For instance, this has been a very good week for Edmund Wilson's 1963 rant ''The Cold War and the Income Tax,'' in which Wilson, the great American stylist and Britain-hater, chooses to unload on those who would use his taxes to build nuclear bomb shelters. 
 Only yesterday I saw a man in a three-piece suit reading Wilson's tome rather avidly in Regent's Park. I swear he was nodding, clearly oblivious to the fact that the book in his hands was barking louder than the dogs at his feet. In London, when people start reading Edmund Wilson's economic opinions in broad daylight, you know that hysteria has suddenly overpowered the rational faculties. 
 I checked the book when I got home and concluded that the man on the park bench had not been turning purple via the rigors of self-analysis. ''The present image of the United States,'' it concludes, is ''homicidal and menacing. ... And for all our boasts of wealth and freedom we are submitting to deprivation and coercion in order to feed and increase it.'' 
 London has no very distinguished record of claiming responsibility for its own messes; therefore, this very bad case of black lung at the banks has many a Londoner seething at the subprime-mortgage disaster in America. In contemplation of the terrible gulf between credit and deposits, Britons are liable to sound like the disillusioned narrator Nick Carraway in ''The Great Gatsby'' as he assesses the brutal world of Tom and Daisy Buchanan: ''They smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money or their vast carelessness or whatever it was that kept them together, and let other people clean up the mess they made.'' 
 But it's our own fault too, and everybody knows it. London has been living like a drunken sailor for the last decade, tripping up the High Street in a small delirium of deregulation and fantasy wealth. In the last few years, house prices in tony Primrose Hill have doubled and doubled again as traders on huge bonuses -- proud of London's reputation as a center of the new financial universe, with them as its masters -- bought $8 million houses and effectively banished most of the rest of us from inner London. Champagne sales have been through the roof -- Britain drinks more of it than the whole of the United States -- but last week The Times of London reported that the only product showing a fresh boom in sales was home safes, as people begin to feel it might be safer to lock their money up at home than keep it at the bank. Prime Minister Gordon Brown's $870 billion rescue plan for British banks didn't do much for the confidence of anyone I spoke with. 
 ''It might save Brown's reputation, but the big party's over for everybody else,'' said one of three men staring into the depths of their cappuccinos at the Cafe 79 on Regent's Park Road. The cafe is just a few doors down from where Friedrich Engels once lived, now marked with a blue plaque. The men in the cafe were very much at one with the national mood, seeking urgently to punish those fat cats and other greed-driven oligarchs who were pulling us into recession. 
 ''Look,'' one of them explained, ''they might call it 'recapitalization,' but what they are doing is nationalizing the banks. It's beyond belief. I don't know if people really understand what is happening.''
 ''Yeah, it's beyond belief,'' said his friend. ''After all this global market stuff we've been hearing for years, the government is basically doing what Tony Benn'' -- a hardcore socialist politician -- ''was advocating in 1983. Trade is contracting and it's as if Thatcher had never existed. All that stuff.'' 
 ''God,'' said his friend. ''Remember it, 'The End of History' and all that?''
 ''Madness.''
 ''We're back to where we started, with the government bailing out the banks and everybody reusing their teabags.'' 
 My friend India Knight, a columnist for The Sunday Times, joined me. ''It's quite nice,'' she said. ''A bit like the Blitz. A bit of decadence in the dark, you know?'' 
 ''Socialism is bursting out all over,'' I said. 
 ''I know,'' said India. ''Greed is not good.'' 
 The restaurants in Primrose Hill were looking pretty but empty. The men finished their coffee and shrugged as they left. ''Good luck,'' one said to the cafe owner. ''Things are going to be very tough.''
 Another old friend turned up with cigarettes for everybody. ''It's amazing,'' he said, with an observation about the glistening financial center on the Thames. ''It looks as if Canary Wharf is going back to what it was -- the Isle of Dogs.''

HEADLINE: Staying Healthy in a Sick Economy

BYLINE: By MANDY KATZ

 BODY:
ON Wall Street, when the going gets tough, will the tough get yoga mats? 
 Adding classes in yoga, meditation and other so-called mind-body regimens is just one way fitness professionals in the financial district are responding to recent economic uncertainties roiling their corporate clientele. Some are also offering shorter, cheaper personal training sessions and, in at least one health club, quiet discounts for members who lose their jobs.
 Amid layoffs, concerns about staying buff could seem trivial. (Imagine the headline ''World Markets Near Collapse: Muscle Tone Under Threat.'') Yet, businesspeople themselves wonder how a perilous financial climate will affect their physical fitness -- and if exercise could help them weather hard times.
 Some struggle to squeeze in any workouts at all. But others, like Amy Sturtevant, an investment director for Oppenheimer & Company in Washington, find themselves doubling down on conditioning for relief. ''Professionals are doing their best not to panic, but I know a lot of professionals who are panicking'' about the markets, she said. ''The only way to get away from it is to have some kind of outlet.'' 
 Ms. Sturtevant, a mother of four, is training for her fourth marathon. With brokerage clients needing more hand-holding, she said, she stints on sleep rather than skip her 5 a.m. daily boot camp and 20-mile weekend runs.
 But one of Ms. Sturtevant's training partners, a portfolio manager, said in an e-mail message that she had not been as diligent as Ms. Sturtevant and had been ''scarce'' at their workouts. The portfolio manager said she had weathered some tough financial cycles, ''but this one has been uniquely disabling.'' 
 ''Forget the 5 o'clock wake-up to run,'' she wrote. ''Who is sleeping?'' 
 One business owner, Sheri David, is backsliding for business reasons. As chief executive of Impressions on Hold, a company based in New York that sells corporate voicemail systems, a tougher sales environment has meant Ms. David sees more of her customers and less of her personal trainer. Over the summer, she dropped from five sessions a week to three; by mid-September, she said, ''it turned into one day for one hour.'' 
 Her trainer, Chris Hall, chides Ms. David to make time and, when she does, to tune out her BlackBerry, she reported. ''But I say, 'You don't understand -- there's 27,000 reasons I have to pay attention,' '' referring to her accounts. 
 For his part, Mr. Hall -- whose clients have included Catherine Zeta-Jones -- is now offering 30-minute, ''high-core, high-intensity'' sessions and shared workouts, he said, ''because people don't necessarily have as much time as they used to, and they don't want to spend as much money.''
 About a third of the 42 million Americans who exercise join fitness centers (a number that's been flat for several years), according to American Sports Data. To keep them on the roster, clubs may be willing to bargain. Most customers who quit the Telos Fitness Center in Dallas, for example, must pay to rejoin. But, for suddenly strapped longtime members, ''I'll put a note in their file and we'll let them pick up their membership without any fees,'' said Clarisa Duran, the center's sales and marketing director.
 For Plus One, which operates in-house fitness centers, corporate accounts are the issue; until recently, its major accounts included the investment banks Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. Though still operating in all of those except Bear Stearns (which closed in March), the company now must look to its recent expansion in other regions and industries for growth, said Tom Maraday, the senior vice president. (Google is one new client.)
 ''We're a little experienced with stress because we went through 9/11 down here,'' said Grace DeSimone, Plus One's national director of group fitness. When disaster strikes, she noted, demand for yoga goes up, and on-site gyms exert a special pull: ''People come and they want someone to talk to -- it's like Cheers.'' 
 And, as in a bar, the televisions stay on. ''In the banks, we have to keep the news on,'' Mr. Maraday said. But at Cadence Cycling and Multisport Centers, TV's show training videos rather than CNBC, because ''we want this to be an escape,'' said Mikael Hanson, director of performance for Cadence in New York.
 During the Bear Stearns collapse, as becalmed financiers sought their escape, midday classes at the in-house gym grew crowded, according to a former Bear Stearns trader who declined to be named. When the final ax fell, they lost not just jobs but access to a club offering ''everything,'' she recalled, a hint of longing in her voice.
 ''They even gave you the shirts and shorts so you didn't have to worry about laundry.'' Now she can no longer get in her daily 5:30 a.m. workout. Her new employer has no gym and, with the markets erupting, her workday starts even earlier. ''I wish there was a gym that opened at 5 in midtown,'' the trader said, ''but there isn't.'' 
 Stephanie Shemin Feingold misses a cushy fitness center, too. Since leaving a Midtown law firm in June to work at a nonprofit in Harlem, she's been using her apartment building's spartan fitness room. ''When there are only three treadmills, it can get crowded pretty quickly,'' she said.
 ''I'm lucky if I get in 20 minutes instead of the hour I used to do,'' Ms. Shemin Feingold said. ''My pants are getting tight. I'm going to have to figure out a new routine, because I can't afford a new wardrobe.'' 
 Fitness matters more than ever if you're laid off, career counselors advise, not just for health, but to network and stay positive. ''The last thing you want is to gain 20 pounds during a job search, '' said Dr. Jan Cannon, author of ''Finding a Job in a Slow Economy.'' ''That just compounds that sense of, 'What's wrong with me?' '' 
 Exercise, she added, can also spur creativity. ''You know how we always have those 'aha' moments in the shower?'' Dr. Cannon said. In the same way, ''a good brisk walk can be very helpful.''
 Jenny Herring, a Des Moines financial writer, usually walks or bikes for respite from the fulltime job search she began in June, after being downsized as part of the subprime mortgage fallout. But one day last month, feeling frustrated when her phone refused to ring, she varied the routine: ''I said, I'm going to get outside, and I mowed the front and back yards'' for exercise.
 For a motivated few, extra time for conditioning actually proves a rare upside of unemployment. ''A lot of people who are between jobs are using this downtime to go after a goal,'' like a triathlon, said Mr. Hanson of Cadence Cycling. 
 Dr. Cannon recalled a client whose workouts last spring ''got more frequent as time went on'' -- to block out the disappointment, and to give her something to get up and do every day. 
 ''She lost 40 pounds.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 23, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article last Thursday about staying fit during the economic crisis, using statistics from American Sports Data, misstated the number of Americans who belong to fitness clubs. The organization estimated that 41.5 million Americans belong to health clubs; it did not say that a third of the 42 million Americans who exercise join such clubs.

HEADLINE: Hello, Customers. Are You Out There?

BYLINE: By ERIC WILSON

 BODY:
THE decline and fall of global economies has not stopped Christophe Decarnin from charging $1,500 for a Balmain T-shirt. That's his cheapest T-shirt. As in a cotton T-shirt, the only distinguishing characteristics being some artfully placed holes. Sparkles will cost you $3,000.
 A fashion director from a top New York specialty store, shopping the Paris collections this month, questioned the wisdom of stocking up on Balmain after visiting the company's showroom, where the price range of fanciest dresses is $12,000 to $22,000, and jackets are priced at about $5,000. Like pretty much every other retailer, she wanted to carry one of the hottest labels in town, but really now, an entire outfit would cost modest 401(k) holders the equivalent of their losses during last week's market chaos. 
 With the spring Fashion Weeks coinciding with the fall financial meltdown, retailers are faced with a dilemma that is partly economic and partly psychographic: How do they convince consumers of luxury goods to loosen their wallets when even the wealthy are showing signs of cutting back? And how do they plan for spring when the fall collections, now in stores, seem to be toxic? Sales were off last month by 15.8 percent at the specialty retail segment of Neiman Marcus, which includes Neiman Marcus stores and Bergdorf Goodman; 10.9 percent at Saks Fifth Avenue and 9.6 percent at Nordstrom, declines that surprised even seasoned retail executives. Luxury goods have seemed all but impervious to economic downturns over the last decade.
 In Paris, as retail executives received sales reports from their stores back home -- in some cases hourly and in most cases dire -- the mood turned cautious. Some stores told designers they would delay the orders for spring.
 ''You've got to put yourself in the minds of customers,'' said Pete Nordstrom, a president of Nordstrom. ''We just have to be a lot better to try to earn their business.''
 Down the front row was Burt Tansky, the chief executive of Neiman Marcus, who had noted as early as March that aspirational customers had begun to pull back in response to economic concerns. Mr. Tansky has projected that the fall season will end up with lower margins and higher leftover inventory than normal. (This did not dissuade Neiman from mailing its Christmas Book last week, an annual exercise in excessiveness that includes a $10 million thoroughbred racing stable in Kentucky alongside a $1,995 Prada lace bag.) ''Like all of us, we'll have to wait to see what happens,'' Mr. Tansky said.
 Several retailers said sales of expensive fashion, especially clothes, had come to a standstill at the end of September. At the shows in Paris, some executives said spring orders would be cut by as much as 10 percent overall, which had a chilling effect on the magazine editors in the audience, because designers will most likely reduce their advertising next year.
 By most accounts, neither designers nor retailers are expecting improvement this year. The critical holiday shopping season is projected to be one of the worst since the last deep recession in the 1980s, before the luxury boom that inspired millions of customers to dream of receiving a Louis Vuitton or Coach handbag rather than a kitchen appliance. The effect of last week's market swings was not as apparent in New York as it may have been in other parts of the country; Barneys New York and Bergdorf Goodman, for example, were fairly buzzing on Friday with foreign shoppers taking advantage of still favorable exchange rates. But at other times last week, and again on Monday, the stores appeared to be almost empty.
 One woman, stopped outside Barneys on Friday, was carrying two shopping bags from the store. Asked what she had bought, she said, ''Nothing. I'm just returning everything.''
 Yes, Louis Vuitton's numbers still look good, up 12 percent last week, Jean-Jacques Guiony, the LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton finance director, assured skeptical analysts on a conference call. But with Wall Street shedding tens of thousands of jobs and financial industry bonuses expected to be meager, one wonders if there are enough members of the Saudi royal family to sustain the designer stores on Fifth Avenue and Madison Avenue.
 ''There is a sense that the air has been taken out of the room,'' said Andrew Jassin, the managing director of Jassin-O'Rourke Group, a fashion consulting firm. Monday's news of a government intervention in ailing banks briefly lifted the spirits of some retailers, who are hoping that new accessories and handbags will continue to sell, even if customers plan to wear them with last year's little black dress.
 ''Before today, it almost looked un-American to shop,'' Mr. Jassin said. ''Saks, Neiman and Nordstrom certainly looked like they were in a lot of pain. And in the immediate and near-term future, there's going to be a downturn in the frequency of trips made to luxury stores.''
 Fashion, to a greater degree than many industries, relies heavily on credit so that designers can buy fabrics to produce expensive clothes for which they will not be paid for at least six months. Should the banks that lend money for that production become even more cautious, or should retailers be unable to pay for the clothes that are in stores now, many designers could face increasingly difficult odds of survival.
 On a positive note, the situation has inspired retailers to more aggressively pursue and promote new labels as a means of differentiating themselves and bringing excitement to their stores. This creates opportunities for smaller, independent designers, as well as some established names who include accessibly priced fashion in their collections. Phillip Lim, Tory Burch, Zac Posen and Nanette Lepore, all of whom have a strong following among younger customers, are potential beneficiaries should stores concentrate their orders on designers with contemporary appeal.
 Stephanie Solomon, the fashion director of Bloomingdale's, said that she was excited about Aquilano.Rimondi, a new label from the Gianfranco Ferre designers, Tommaso Aquilano and Roberto Rimondi. Ann Watson, the fashion director of Henri Bendel, cited Sharon Wauchob, an Irish designer working in Paris, as one of the most promising collections of the season. 
 ''We're looking for special things, but we are being prudent as to how we invest,'' said Stephen I. Sadove, the chief executive of Saks, which has also forecast weak sales through the end of the year.
 Tatsugo Yoda, the president of Aloha Rag, with a new fashion-forward boutique in New York, bought more items that he felt were reasonably priced but that also offered surprise. He ordered all-in-one looks from M/Marani, which cost about $400, Giuseppe Zanotti sandals and new 1980s-inspired shoe styles from the Venetian cult brand Golden Goose. 
 ''Really high-end clothing is a little bit slow, but people still want to play around,'' Mr. Yoda said. ''They're looking for something with different details than what everybody else has.''
 While retailers acknowledged that they were likely to place smaller orders this season, several said they were at the same time looking for directional fashion -- something that will appeal to customers' emotions -- rather than making safe choices that may not even inspire them to walk into a store.

HEADLINE: In Gold We Trust

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPH PETERS. 
Christoph Peters is the author of the novel ''The Fabric of Night.'' This article was translated by John Cullen from the German.

DATELINE: Berlin 

 BODY:
 ''SOME problems may lie in store for us, but I don't foresee a catastrophe,'' said a woman I know, a business consultant in risk management. When I asked her to be specific, she referred to the Swedish banking crisis of the early 1990s. It was dealt with pretty successfully, she said, by measures similar to those now being put in place, though of course you can't compare Sweden to the United States.
 ''This shouldn't surprise you,'' my octogenarian neighbor, formerly an exemplary comrade in East Germany and still a convinced socialist, smugly remarked. ''It's the great crisis inherent in the transition from monopoly capitalism to state monopoly capitalism; in other words, the final stage of your system. Under the Communists, kids learned about this process in grade school.'' 
 Despite the dramatic headlines about the spreading financial crisis, and although it's been clear for some time that the problem is no longer confined to the American real estate market, Germans are reacting to the situation with remarkable calm. I don't know anyone who has thought seriously about taking his savings out of the bank and stashing them in the fridge. Unlike professional investors, savers are behaving quite rationally, perhaps because of the continual assertions from all sides that our economy, despite everything, is in fine shape and accordingly stocks will soon be climbing again, or maybe simply because no expert can offer advice that another expert won't denounce as the worst possible approach.
 Apart from perplexity, the most frequent reaction is sarcasm, which can be bitter or absurd, depending on one's character and degree of exposure. Everyone who has eschewed risky so-called ''financial products'' feels something like schadenfreude, accompanied by a measured concern. 
 Television viewers accustomed to watching stockbrokers in action on their screens have long suspected that these are people with severe personality disorders, people who exercise their crude mixture of special talent and gambling compulsion in a morality-free zone and couldn't care less about the consequences for the rest of the world. The idea that such people may soon find themselves, if not in prison, then at least in a soup kitchen provides satisfaction to many a German who in recent years has had to bear the contempt of clever financial advisers looking down upon him as a timorous fool for passing up the chance to let his money really work for him.
 I felt a certain uneasiness last week when Chancellor Angela Merkel and her finance minister, Peer Steinbruck, stood before the cameras and announced that the state would guarantee all the nation's savings accounts, an amount estimated to be at least 1.6 trillion euros. That they considered it necessary to talk the citizenry out of being worried suggested for the first time that there were, in reality, grounds for even greater worries.
 I briefly considered whether, with winter coming on, there might still be some possibility of acquiring a piece of land, complete with potatoes and cows, near Berlin. I quickly realized, however, that I know even less about farming than I do about financial markets and concluded that I had better steer clear of both. 
 I asked my friend the business consultant what she thought about investing in gold, which -- although it lacks any practical nutritive value -- has been for millenniums a most desirable commodity; she rolled her eyes at my naivete and explained that the gold market was highly speculative right now: as soon as confidence in businesses and securities returns, she said, people will dump gold by the ton and the price will be cut in half.
 Nonetheless, I confess that I've been secretly thinking about converting at least a portion of my next royalties, assuming there are any, into gold coins and stuffing them into a pretty leather bag, like the one Pippi Longstocking keeps in her big wooden chest. That way, at least, when the looming (even though nobody can tell you exactly what it's going to look like) catastrophe arrives, I'll still have something to swap for candy for my daughter.

HEADLINE: The Virtues of Spending

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER. 
Keith Bradsher also reported from Dongguan, China, last month and later added additional reporting from Hong Kong.

DATELINE: GUANGZHOU, China 

 BODY:
For years, Asians have been held up as an example to the world for their discipline in saving rather than spending. Now their leaders are trying to break them of that habit.
 As Americans and Europeans pull back in what many expect to be a global recession, Asian consumers may be the last hope to preserve economic growth in part of the world -- and even Asian consumers are becoming nervous about falling real estate prices and slumping stock markets in their own countries.
 At the Canton Fair, the world's largest export exposition, which opened here Wednesday, executives from across China, from manufacturers of chain saws to producers of stereo headphones, complained of rising costs and falling sales.
 China's customs agency said Monday that 52.7 percent of the country's toy exporting companies had ceased operations in the first seven months of this year. Most of the 3,631 toy exporters that went out of business were small. Still, those closures came before the global economic picture was made even bleaker by a slump in bank lending and confidence in Western financial centers. 
 ''It's a disaster,'' said Kevin Cao, the export manager of the HuangYang Bronze Company, a producer of aluminum wire whose exports have dropped by nearly half since July and which has had to cut a quarter of its work force.
 Difficulties among Chinese exporters may seem incongruous, given that China announced Monday that its exports were 21.5 percent higher in September than a year earlier, and the country had a record monthly trade surplus of $29.3 billion.
 But when adjusted for inflation and the Chinese currency's rise against the dollar, Chinese exports actually fell 0.5 percent in August from a year earlier, and are likely to be flat for September, for which inflation data has not been released.
 The gloom among suppliers at the Canton Fair on Wednesday suggests that shipments will slow further in the months to come.
 This has all come as a shock to China's huge export sector, which enjoyed annual growth -- even with inflation and currency changes -- of 20 to 30 percent a year through the summer of 2007. 
 But now order books are thinning. At the Ningbo Deye Domestic Electrical Appliance Technology Company, which makes space heaters and air-conditioners, orders have shrunk by half, said Allen Dong, the company's export manager.
 Many Chinese companies initially responded to weakness in United States sales last year by stepping up marketing in Europe. Chinese exports to Europe quickly surpassed those to the United States. That growth came to a screeching halt this summer as economic and financial troubles jumped the Atlantic to Europe.
 Ningbo Deye's exports to Europe were down 20 percent last month compared with a year earlier. It has shrunk its work force to 1,000, from 1,500 last year.
 Some of the most striking drops in exports have occurred in shipments of consumer electronics, garments and toys to the United States, even as some Chinese producers are moving to Vietnam, partly because of lower wages there.
 Over the last year, the Yangzhou Sure International Trading Company's sales of television remote controls have dropped more than 80 percent in the United States and sales to Europe have fallen 30 percent, said Allan Peter, the general manager.
 But it is far from clear that Asians will pick up the slack in consumption. Most economists say current economic conditions will make it hard to persuade Asian consumers to replace Western buyers. For instance, homes and stocks are worth less here and food and energy prices -- still high by historical standards -- are eroding incomes.
 ''Consumer behavior cannot be changed by the wave of a wand,'' said Ifzal Ali, the chief economist of the Asian Development Bank. ''Domestic demand-led growth is easier said than done.''
 Stephen S. Roach, the chairman of Morgan Stanley Asia, calculates that even with more than a billion inhabitants apiece, China and India each have total personal consumption spending that lags that of Germany, which has 82 million people.
 Political leaders across Asia are tailoring policies to change that. India has given generous raises to the country's four million civil servants, hoping that they will spend some of the money. The government also encouraged banks to lend by reducing the amount of cash they are required to deposit with the central bank. China also has reduced bank reserve requirements, and has cut interest rates and lowered taxes. 
 Japan and Taiwan have increased government spending on all kinds of projects. 
 The difficulties in Asia now are completely different from the financial crisis that shook the region a decade ago. Much of the problem then lay in banks that failed after borrowing heavily. Those failures left corporations starved for credit and they had to drastically curtail operations -- a predicament many fear for the United States and Europe now.
 By contrast, most Asian banks have been more cautious in their lending since then. The contagion infecting Asian economies now is mainly economic, through trade. JPMorgan calculates the annualized rate of growth in Asian emerging markets in the second quarter compared with the first was 6.6 percent, and just 2 percent excluding China and India. 
 Most of the region's economies appear to have slowed further in the third quarter. 
 At stake is not just economic growth, but also social stability. Japan's previous prime minister resigned Sept. 1 as his country's economy shrank. Malaysia's opposition has attracted throngs of voters unhappy about inflation. Crowds protesting Thailand's weak growth and fractious politics have blocked airport runways and the Parliament building. And candidates promising a minimum wage and other measures to shore up embattled workers won last month's legislative elections in Hong Kong. 
 Though Asian leaders face an uphill struggle to shift from export-led growth to a dependence on domestic demand, businessmen say there is no choice. 
 In Chennai, India, Rafeeque Ahmed, the chairman of one of India's biggest shoe exporters, laid off 800 of his 6,800 employees as exports weakened this year. Now his company, the Farida Group, plans to start selling to Indian stores in June and is exploring plans to open its own chain of Indian stores in 2010. ''We feel like the whole world is now looking at India, so why aren't we looking at India?'' he said.
 Similarly, Henry Ye, chairman of a large Chinese garment manufacturer, the Smartex Group, has bought a 60 percent stake in a chain of 300 clothing stores in east-central China. He wants to reduce his factories' dependence on sales to Western retailers.
 Mr. Ye has converted the original headquarters of his company in Xiamen, China, into a hotel to appeal to the growing numbers of Chinese who travel domestically. He has also set up a construction division to build homes.
 ''The U.S. dollar is still very, very weak'' compared with China's currency, Mr. Ye said. ''The future for China is promising.''
 Many economists say China is the Asian country least vulnerable to slowing exports. 
 Until this summer, the economy had double-digit growth. The government has a small budget surplus and modest debts, which give it a lot of room to cut taxes and spend more on big projects in response to factory closings and other problems that are starting to appear as companies move some manufacturing elsewhere in Asia.
 Still, Western economists have been reducing their growth forecasts to 8 or 9 percent by early next year. That would be a bonanza for most countries, but could pose a problem for China, where officials are already struggling to find jobs for close to 20 million rural people who move to cities each year. 
 Factory closings have spread in and around Dongguan and Guangzhou, sprawling industrial cities in southeastern China. Zheng Peixi, 30, a waitress who works at a Thai restaurant in Guangzhou that has had a lot of empty tables lately, said she was eating out less and doing more window shopping than buying. 
 India, Japan, Taiwan and Southeast Asian nations with weaker demand at home and less solid government finances face greater troubles, though nothing as wrenching as the Asian financial crisis a decade ago.
 Japan's economy has already begun shrinking, economic growth in India has slowed to the weakest pace in nearly four years and economies elsewhere in Asia have decelerated noticeably. Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand are all looking at ways to finance increased government spending beyond what they had planned at the start of their fiscal years.
 Americans and Western Europeans were conspicuous for their absence on the opening day of the Canton Fair. But they were partly offset by customers from South America, Russia, Africa, Asia and the Mideast, where the global financial crisis is only beginning to hurt.
 A few exporters that sell only to emerging markets maintain they have not seen weakness in sales. Li Gang, sales manager of the Shanghai Pudong Import and Export Company, which specializes in exports of power saws to Eastern Europe and South America, said that the company's order book was steady.
 Other businesses, including rivals in the power tool business, said that no exporter had escaped the downturn. ''Big or small, everyone has been affected,'' said Dai Chao Yang, the general manager of the Shanghai Kedun Power Tools Company, which has experienced a 20 percent drop in exports this year.
 But the market is not entirely bleak for the company. Half its sales are in China, and these sales are still rising.

HEADLINE: Lending Alternative Hits Hurdle

BYLINE: By BRAD STONE

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
It was one of the most audacious ideas of the Web 2.0 boom -- that people could lend money to other people over the Internet and cut out the middlemen, also known as traditional banks.
 In the last three years, Internet start-ups with names like Prosper, Lending Club, Zopa and Loanio have all pursued that goal. Together, these companies were on pace to broker roughly $150 million in loans this year, a 50 percent increase over 2007, according to the Online Banking Report, a financial industry newsletter.
 But this so-called peer-to-peer lending, which until recently seemed that it might offer a reliable source of money in this calamitous economic environment, is now experiencing a squeeze of its own.
 On Wednesday, the nation's largest peer-to-peer lending site, San Francisco-based Prosper, stopped allowing lenders to make new loans, saying it needed to wait while the Securities and Exchange Commission evaluated its regulatory filings. 
 Monthly loan volumes at the company have been declining since the credit crisis worsened this spring. Prosper, which is unprofitable after raising $40 million in venture capital, now faces the damaging possibility that lenders may take their money off the site instead of waiting for the S.E.C. to allow lending to resume. That could take several months.
 ''Regulatory agencies seem to want to make sure they have all this understood before it gets too big,'' said Jim Bruene, editor of the Online Banking Report. ''This is definitely going to slow peer-to-peer lending down.''
 There are other signs of trouble as well. Last week, the London-based Zopa closed its Web site aimed at the United States, citing ''extremely difficult consumer credit circumstances.'' Zopa continues to maintain lending sites in Britain, Italy and Japan.
 The problems in this fledgling corner of the finance world come at a particularly bad time. As traditional lenders hoard cash and shun even dependable borrowers, peer-to-peer lending sites could have offered an alternative source of credit -- and, in some cases, a lower interest rate.
 On Prosper, for example, interest rates on three-year fixed loans are set in an auctionlike format. Borrowers publicly disclose the amount they want to borrow, their credit histories and some personal details (stories of hardship and photos of cute pets sometimes help). Lenders compete with the best interest rates to offer those people cash, and Prosper collects fees on each loan.
 Prosper's founder and chief executive, Chris Larsen, speaking on Monday just before the company unexpectedly entered a quiet period mandated by the S.E.C., said peer-to-peer lending harked back to an age when borrowers and lenders knew one another personally.
 ''This is the big trend right now; Wall Street firms are becoming banks again and getting back to their roots,'' he said. ''Peer-to-peer lending is the simplest form of pure banking there is.''
 But Prosper and its cohorts are now encountering some modern hurdles. Last April, Lending Club, a start-up based in Sunnyvale, Calif., that facilitates borrowing between members of social networks like Facebook, asked the S.E.C. for permission to create a secondary marketplace -- a place on its site where lenders could resell their loans and cash out before the end of a loan's three-year life cycle.
 According to Renaud Laplanche, the founder and chief executive of Lending Club, the S.E.C. surprised the company by asking whether it should have registered as a seller of securities before it started to broker loans. In response to those discussions, Lending Club stopped all new lending on its site for six months, frustrating its lenders, many of whom withdrew their cash. 
 ''If we had a clean situation to start with, we probably could have registered the new offering while our current marketplace continued on,'' Mr. Laplanche said. On Tuesday, the S.E.C. accredited Lending Club, and the site reopened. 
 On Monday, Mr. Larsen said he did not believe Prosper would need to follow the same arduous route, pointing out that Lending Club sets the interest rates on its loans and was itself financing about half the overall loan volume on the site. 
 But on Tuesday, Prosper changed its mind and also filed to create a secondary marketplace, halting activity on Prosper.com. The company would not comment, citing the quiet period, but the painful step suggests that it too decided it needed to obtain proper registration from the S.E.C. and avoid any legal ambiguity that could get it into regulatory trouble. 
 Even before lending on Prosper was halted, the much-hyped start-up appeared to be encountering some problems. Though the company says 7.9 percent more money has been lent on the site this year than last year at this time, the monthly total actually peaked in May and has been steadily declining ever since. The average loan amount on Prosper has also fallen 13 percent from last year, as lenders have become nervous about whether borrowers will repay the loan.
 Francis A. Vasquez, a 44-year-old lawyer in Vienna, Va., who has lent more than $186,000 on the site since January 2007, says one reason for those jitters is the high default rates on the site. 
 In his first four months on the site last year, for example, Mr. Vasquez said nearly 30 percent of his loans were in default or were four months late, costing him a 1.2 percent loss on his investment. ''I don't think there is a whole lot of trust on the site,'' he said, citing borrowers who never had any intention of paying back loans in the first place.
 Many lenders, including Mr. Vasquez, have responded by seeking out more reliable kinds of borrowers in the top credit-score categories. 
 Indeed, prime borrowers accounted for 45 percent of the activity on the site in September, up from 30 percent a year earlier. But those borrowers, at least in normal economic times, have plenty of other places to raise cash.
 Other large lenders on Prosper have simply stopped lending altogether. Half of the 20 largest lenders on the site have not made a new investment since August, according to the tracking site Lendingstats.com. A majority of the others have markedly decreased their lending. That might account for the declining month-to-month activity on the site during a time when Prosper needs to show that it has legs.
 ''Companies like Prosper are really just starting up and need to ramp up to significant growth levels to get to a point where they become profitable,'' said Eric Petroelje, a computer programmer in Grand Rapids, Mich., who maintains a Web site at www.ericscc.com that tracks activity on Prosper and other lending sites. ''Instead, it is just kind of leveling off.''
 Nevertheless, there remains a resilient strain of optimism in the fledgling world of online lending.
 Loanio, a start-up based in Nanuet, N.Y., opened a new site this month focusing on the subprime borrowers that other sites are increasingly leaving behind. The start-up believes it can get these difficult loans financed by having borrowers persuade friends or family to co-sign and step in if the borrower falls behind on payments. 
 Another company, Pertuity Direct, based in Washington, said that when it introduces its site in November it will target only respectable prime borrowers.
 On Monday, Mr. Larsen of Prosper said he expected that things could get rough during the current economic crisis, but that peer-to-peer lending was well suited for a protracted recession.
 ''In many ways this is a good opportunity for us to show we can be part of the solution,'' he said. ''I just love the idea that Americans have a place to turn for credit, and that they don't have to wait for lenders and major banks to decide when we are going to come out of this thing.''

HEADLINE: Start-Ups Give Idaho An Identity Beyond Potatoes

BYLINE: By JAMES FLANIGAN. 
This column about small-business trends in California and the West appears on the third Thursday of every month. E-mail: jamesflanigan@nytimes.com

 BODY:
IDAHO may be best known for its potatoes -- it produces, after all, a third of all the potatoes in the United States. But its economy is increasingly being driven by technology and green manufacturing companies, big and small. 
 Most of those companies have settled in the Boise Valley, an area of about 600,000 people, where they have received an enthusiastic response from city officials and technological and business assistance from Boise State University. 
 ''Some 70 percent of Idaho's economy is in high technology,'' said Jason Crawforth, founder and chief strategy officer of MobileDataforce, a Boise company with a software system for compiling and transmitting information from handsets in the field to databases in the home office. Mr. Crawforth cited American Electronics Association statistics that show Idaho's exports to be chiefly in computer chips, parts and equipment, notwithstanding the potato. 
 Yet it was the potato, in a way, that started Boise on a path to high technology industry. In 1978, the late Jack Simplot, founder of the J.R. Simplot Company, developer of Idaho russet potatoes and of freeze-dried French fries for McDonald's, invested in a start-up called Micron Technology, a maker of semiconductors. 
 Micron now has more than 20,000 employees and close to $6 billion in annual revenues. (Micron is not immune to the turmoil in global economic markets. It announced last week that it would lay off more than 3,000 employees in the next two years because of a glut in microchips.) 
 Idaho farmers have been backing technological start-ups ever since. Gerald R. Thompson, for example, said he raised $2 million from farmers near Boise in 2006 to start a company, Sky Detective. The company combines global positioning satellite technology with cellular phone technology from Qualcomm to produce a device capable of tracking people and cargoes anywhere in the world.
 Mr. Thompson, now a retired deputy sheriff in Los Angeles, said he saw a device that added satellite surveillance to a Qualcomm system to monitor the whereabouts of commercial trucks and found that law enforcement agencies were interested in the device as well. 
 So he went back to Boise, where he had grown up, raised the start-up money and now has a company with 13 employees, as well as contract consultants in the United States and a manufacturing staff in China. ''We make the hardware in China,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''But for software, I recruited engineering students at Boise State University who came up with all sorts of great ideas.'' 
 The Sky Detective product is now being used by law enforcement agencies, and the company is pursuing expansion worldwide and into consumer markets, so users can track children and pets. It is also seeking substantial capital investment, though Mr. Thompson said last week that ''it's a tough time to raise money.'' He added: ''I am seeing very cautionary demeanors in the venture capital and investment banking community. But they also tell me there is a lot of money on sidelines for the right opportunity.'' 
 MobileDataforce, Mr. Crawforth's company, also uses cellphone technology for tasks as diverse as enabling workers in the field to give instant estimates and insurance payments for damages to automobiles and homes to keeping track of every metal rod and bolt in the new Bay Bridge under construction between San Francisco and Oakland. The company, Mr. Crawforth said, is awaiting a contract from the Agency for International Development to monitor distribution of AIDS vaccines and medicines in 13 African countries. 
 And yes, he said, the company has concerns these days about cash flow. ''We do the work ahead of time and need to keep payments coming in.'' Mr. Crawforth said he and MobileDataforce's three other owners were looking to raise capital. 
 Another Boise company, the two-year-old Balihoo, uses complex Web-based software to help advertisers find potential audiences in the fragmented media field of social networks, Web sites and phone devices, not to mention newspapers, television and cable channels. ''There are unmanageable numbers of Web sites,'' said Vincent Martino, who is in charge of technology as Balihoo's chief operating officer. ''But our software can communicate with 100 sites directly and get the advertiser information to make an intelligent, efficient decision.'' 
 Balihoo was founded by Peter Gombert, an entrepreneur who had previously started and sold three software companies. The company, which has 75 employees, is financed by $5.5 million in venture capital raised from Lacuna Gap Capital in Boulder, Colo., and Highway 12 Ventures, a Boise firm. 
 As to current economic conditions, Mr. Gombert said in an interview last week: ''As a venture-backed firm, we do not rely heavily on general credit markets. The bigger concern is whether recession causes companies to reduce marketing and advertising. We have seen some pullback from our advertisers, but nothing significant at this point. The true tale will be told over the next three to six months.''
 Boise's enthusiasm for business encouraged Dr. Carl R. Thornfeldt, a dermatologist for 25 years, to found a company, Episciences Inc., and create nonprescription products to reduce skin inflammation. The company now distributes those products through physicians' offices. Episciences has 22 employees and, he said, ''will expand this year through a venture in Japan.'' 
 Sandhill Industries, which recycles plate glass to make tiles for kitchens and bathrooms, moved to Boise six years ago from Alaska. The company was founded in 1998 by Terri Raudenbush, an engineering graduate of Colorado State University, and her husband, Jim, a forest firefighter for the federal government, with close to $400,000 in grants from the state of Alaska's Science and Technology Foundation and the federal Environmental Protection Administration. The move to Boise helped her business, Mrs. Raudenbush said, ''because we are closer to a supply of plate glass and to customers for shipping.'' 
 In a factory just outside Boise, Mrs. Raudenbush and three employees fuse recycled powdered glass in a low-energy furnace, add pigment for up to 36 colors, cut and bake tiles in kilns, cool them and ship them out. The company was included in a list of green producers on Martha Stewart's television show two years ago and has distributed its tiles through its Web site from that time. Sandhill Industries has about $500,000 in annual sales, Mrs. Raudenbush said. 
 ''Our big advantage is the fact that we are a 'green' producer,'' she explained. As to the current economic financial environment, ''We have minuscule debt,'' she added, with emphasis. ''We pay off every month any advances we take from our $10,000 credit line from the bank.''

HEADLINE: Mob Muscles Its Way Into Politics in Bulgaria

BYLINE: By DOREEN CARVAJAL and STEPHEN CASTLE

 BODY:
SOFIA, Bulgaria -- Politics is played to the death in Bulgaria, where the lives of politicians can be as cheap as spent bullets and murky business groups wage a murderous struggle for their cut of everything from real estate deals to millions in European aid.
During a furious political season last year, the home of the chairwoman of a municipal electoral committee was set on fire, and the garages of mayors were firebombed. The mayor of a resort town in central Bulgaria was shot and killed with seven bullets, as was the wealthy City Council chairman in the outwardly idyllic Black Sea port of Nesebur.
''Other countries have the mafia,'' said Atanas Atanasov, a member of Parliament and a former counterintelligence chief who is a magnet for leaked documents exposing corruption. ''In Bulgaria, the mafia has the country.''
By almost any measure, Bulgaria is the most corrupt country in the 27-member European Union. Since it joined last year, it has emerged as a cautionary tale for Western nations confronting the stark reality and heavy costs of drawing fragile post-Communist nations into their orbit, away from Russia's influence. 
European Union membership has done little to tame the criminal networks in Bulgaria. It has arguably only made those networks richer, raising worries that if the union cannot tamp down criminal activity in a member like Bulgaria it may have little sway over other fragile nations that want to join.
The United States helped Bulgaria into NATO, has rotated troops through for joint exercises since 2004 and has tried to encourage commerce, education and democracy. It has just announced that it will invest more than $90 million in facilities and equipment for joint use in military exercises.
The European Union, eager to improve the lives of the 7.5 million Bulgarians, has promised 11 billion euros, or nearly $15 billion, in aid.
Far from halting crime and violence, the money effectively spread the corruption. Once Bulgaria's shady businessmen realized how much European Union money was at stake, said many of Sofia's advocates for reform, they moved from buying off politicians to being directly involved in politics themselves.
And so European officials froze almost $670 million in financing this summer and may halt the flow of billions more, alarmed at freewheeling white-collar criminals with links to the very highest reaches of power.
The nation's homegrown mobs of men in black -- the ''mutri,'' or mugs -- control construction projects in city halls. And questionable business networks have moved from declining black markets for smuggled cigarettes and alcohol to legal investments in booming real estate. They have made their mark on the capital's atmosphere: men nicknamed ''thick necks'' for their muscular appearance linger in neon-lighted nightclubs like Sin City and Lipstick, or keep watch over Mercedes jeeps and Audis outside. Sofia guidebooks offer tips: Avoid restaurants that draw businessmen with four or more bodyguards.
Now, men like this are muscling into public office.
Ties to Top Officials
Investigators with the European Union's antifraud office are focusing on the Nikolov-Stoykov group, a sprawling conglomerate of dozens of companies with interests from meat processing and cold storage to scrap metal and a Black Sea resort.
The group's leading partners -- both briefly detained last year on suspicion of fraud -- boast top connections. Ludmil Stoykov helped finance the campaign of President Georgi Parvanov, organized a business group supporting him and maintained ties to a former deputy minister of foreign affairs.
Mr. Stoykov, who has not been charged with any crime since his arrest last year, denies knowing about criminal activities involving European Union funds. ''I categorically object to these attempts to stain my name and to be treated as a criminal,'' he said in answer to written questions.
He acknowledges giving 25,000 leva, about $17,000, as a campaign contribution to Bulgaria's president. ''I participated with a donation according to all requirements by the law,'' he said. ''And no one is saying the opposite.''
His partner, Mario Nikolov, who is scheduled to stand trial next week on fraud charges, forged discreet alliances to Prime Minister Sergei Stanishev, according to contracts and bank deposit slips turned over to prosecutors last week by Boyko Borisov, the mayor of Sofia, who is a fierce rival of the prime minister. Those documents show he steered more than $137,000 to Mr. Stanishev's Socialist Party as contributions from his companies.
In an unusually blunt report leaked this summer, European Union fraud investigators accused the Nikolov-Stoykov group of being a front for a ''criminal company network composed of more than 50 Bulgarian enterprises and various other European and offshore companies.''
Among the European Union investigators' accusations were tax and subsidy fraud: taking development aid to buy new equipment for companies and then passing off ancient equipment from the former East Germany and pocketing the difference. The companies were also accused of illegally importing huge quantities of Chinese rabbit meat for export to France and Germany with fake health certificates from Argentina.
Reached at his office at Eurofrigo, a cold storage company in Sofia, Mr. Nikolov repeatedly declined to comment on the documents indicating contributions to the prime minister, which Bulgarian prosecutors said Wednesday were under formal investigation. After the European fraud report was leaked, Mr. Nikolov said: ''I became public enemy No. 1. I am afraid for my life.''
Mr. Stanishev, the prime minister, did not respond to 10 attempts to seek comment over a six-day period. A former journalist educated at the London School of Economics, Mr. Stanishev was called ''Mr. Clean'' by President Bush last year for his efforts to fight organized crime. After other European nations started complaining about aid fraud, Mr. Stanishev said publicly that there was no ''umbrella'' of protection for rich businessmen or organized crime figures.
But when he made those comments, it was not known that he met in 2005 with Mr. Nikolov. A five-minute video obtained from Sofia's mayor shows Mr. Stanishev greeting Mr. Nikolov at his meat factory, inspecting equipment and a table laden with goose liver sausages before sitting down to lunch with white wine.
A few weeks later, according to deposit slips handed to prosecutors by Mr. Borisov, Sofia's mayor, contributions to Mr. Stanishev's party started to flow. One Western European diplomat, who spoke anonymously because of being involved in sensitive negotiations in Bulgaria, said that copies of the contractual agreements on donations appeared authentic: ''It means they know they won't be prosecuted, so why not have secret contracts?''
A summary agreement was addressed to Rumen Petkov, who headed the Socialists' campaign at the time and resigned as interior minister a few months ago amid revelations that he had met organized crime figures.
Origins of Crime
Bulgaria's gray economy is looped around disparate politically connected companies that shift in and out of business as opportunities and legal obstacles arise, according to a report from the Center for the Study of Democracy, an anticorruption group in Sofia.
According to the center and other anticorruption activists, bosses typically enlist longtime employees to register companies in their names; if there are legal problems, the companies cease functioning without being linked to the actual leaders. Meanwhile, profits from sources like cigarette or alcohol smuggling are plowed into legal front companies, like soccer clubs, where money can be laundered through huge fees paid for transfers of players.
The competition is brutal: all three past chairmen of the soccer club Lokomotiv Plovdiv have been killed, one by a sniper by the Black Sea. Seventy-five percent of Bulgarian businesses have security protection, far more than in other countries in Eastern Europe, according to Enterprise Surveys, analysts for the World Bank.
As in Russia and some other Balkan nations, corruption has seeped into the fabric of life. Sofia has a thriving black market for blood outside hospitals, where patients' families haggle over purchases with dealers, according to Bulgarian news reports that track the prices.
The roots of this organized crime date to the collapse of Communism in the early 1990s. Thousands of secret agents and athletes, including wrestlers once supported and coddled by the state, were cast onto the street. During the United Nations embargo of warring Serbia in the 1990s, they seized smuggling opportunities and solidified their networks.
The wrestlers, in particular, developed private security forces and insurance companies that were little more than shakedown protection rackets. Other men became shadowy entrepreneurs with close ties to the government.
In the past five years, Bulgaria has weathered machine gun assassinations and inventive daylight attacks. Hitmen disguised themselves as drunks and Orthodox priests. In 2004, a bomb planted atop an elevator in central Sofia was detonated by cellphone, killing a businessman and three bodyguards.
The toll now tops more than 125 contract killings since 1993, according to a list compiled by the United States Embassy in Sofia, which does not include at least four people killed this year, including the head of an energy company. Most of the killings are unsolved.
A Power Grab Begins
Admission to the European Union did not halt the carnage, but emboldened a power grab. According to corruption fighters and election observers, votes can be traded, depending on the town, for marijuana cigarettes or sold for up to 100 leva, or $69. People document their votes by taking pictures of their ballots with their cellphone cameras, according to Iva Pushkarova, executive director of the Bulgarian Judges Association.
''They trade votes freely on the streets, kill and threaten people with no shame,'' Ms. Pushkarova said.
While corruption affects many corners of society, the impact is particularly stark in the legal system, where some people without political connections have resorted to hiring decoy lawyers, for fear that their legal documents would vanish if presented to particular clerks by lawyers recognized as working for them.
Kremikovtzi, an insolvent Communist-era steel plant and one of Bulgaria's largest companies, has become a test case. Foreign creditors -- many of them American hedge funds -- are pursuing a $474 million claim against Kremikovtzi, whose former chief executive is under investigation by the Bulgarian authorities for fraud and embezzlement.
''When your law enforcement system isn't cleaning up the corruption in the legal system, who do we go to?'' asked Justin Holland, an adviser to the Kremikovtzi investors committee, ''Literally, we cannot go to anybody in Bulgaria.''
Among Western nations, impatience is growing, particularly at the lack of trials of high-level government officials accused of corruption. As Frans Timmermans, the Dutch minister for European affairs, argued, ''What we need to see is real people put before real judges, convicted and put in jail.''
Meglena Pluchieva, Bulgaria's newly appointed deputy prime minister for oversight of European government funding, said she believed that the nation was making headway similar to that of nations that joined the European Union a few years earlier, in 2004. The difference is that then there was enthusiasm for union expansion, but today ''the situation is entirely different,'' she said. She also accused wealthier nations of double standards, citing a scandal over rotten meat in Germany last year.
Some European countries have simply given up on Bulgarian justice.
Germany complained of getting little local help in its effort to prosecute Konstantin Hadjivanov, a wealthy businessman and a member of the City Council in Petrich, Bulgaria, who is known as ''the Kitty.''
So the Germans waited until he had stepped into Greece to serve their warrant. Now he sits in a jail cell on cigarette smuggling charges while facing another fraud inquiry.
But it is only a matter of time before he returns home to resume his political career, say his supporters and wife, a former Mrs. Bulgaria.
City elections, canceled once because of irregularities, took place on Saturday. From his Greek jail cell, Mr. Hadjivanov gamely ran for re-election, but the voters finally rebelled: He won less than 1 percent of Petrich's vote.

HEADLINE: As Consumers Keep Wallets Shut, Economic Outlook Dims

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
Even as the federal government and its counterparts around the world readied an ambitious financial bailout, more signs emerged on Wednesday that the economic downturn had taken a darker turn.
 Retail sales fell sharply in September as consumers shunned department stores, auto showrooms and shopping malls, ratcheting back spending for a third month. Economic activity slowed, according to a report from the Federal Reserve. And the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, warned in a speech that a recovery ''will not happen right away.''
 Each bleak economic report compounded on the last, and by the end of the day the Dow Jones industrial average had fallen 733 points. Many investors fear that corporations -- and by extension their workers and shareholders -- will face harder times. 
 The key troubles lie with the American consumer, who, after months of coping with soaring gasoline prices, is faced with losses in the stock market and an uncertain financial future. 
 The impact of the crisis on Wall Street put a clear dent in consumer spending. Last month's 1.2 percent decline in retail sales was the sharpest drop in years, and it came in the back-to-school shopping season, traditionally the busiest time of the year for retailers outside of the December holidays.
 The cutback in spending was underscored by the anecdotal reports in the Fed's ''beige book,'' a regular survey of businesses around the country. The report found that spending decreased in all 12 metropolitan districts included in the report, and businesses that responded to the Fed complained they ''had become more pessimistic about the economic outlook.''
 ''Normally the beige book has a lot of, 'On the one hand, on the other hand,' '' said Ethan Harris, an economist at Barclays Capital. ''But all 12 districts weakened. That's a recession sentence, without using the word.''
 Auto dealers and manufacturers were hit hardest, as motor vehicle sales plummeted and orders tapered off at industrial companies. The real estate market remained stagnant and credit was tight. Discount and dollar stores reported more buyers, but sales fell 1.5 percent at department stores.
 The slower sales are, in part, a result of the evaporation of common sources of consumer credit, which fueled the growth in consumption in the last decade. That flood of credit now has slowed to a trickle. ''You're beginning to see the deterioration of credit cards, consumer debt, home equity lines,'' said Stephen Wood, a strategist at Russell Investments. 
 And a precipitous decline in consumer spending -- the primary engine of economic growth for the last decade -- could have dire consequences for the labor market, workers' salaries and American industry.
 ''There can be no doubt now that the economy is in recession,'' Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics wrote in a note. ''It will be there awhile.''
 The bleak numbers could also spur further interest rate cuts from the Fed, which meets again at the end of the month. Mr. Bernanke, in his speech in New York, underscored the bleak outlook suggested by Wednesday's reports, warning that the economy would face an extended period of difficulty.
 Businesses may also be unnerved by signs that the global economy is slowing. Over the last year, as the American economy stumbled, domestic businesses became heavily dependent on foreign sales to prop up their bottom line. A downturn in Europe, coupled with a stronger dollar, could cut off that crucial source of revenue. Even Mr. Bernanke cautioned that export sales would slow.
 Mr. Harris, of Barclays, said: ''Trade has been one of the crutches of the economy in the last year. And it's clearly weakening.''
 The retail sales report, released by the Commerce Department, showed that automobile sales fell about 4 percent last month. A broad range of products sat unsold in stores as well, including furniture, electronics and clothing, suggesting that Americans were delaying big purchases. 
 ''There is almost nothing positive to say about these figures,'' Rob Carnell, an economist at ING Bank, wrote in a note.
 Even a sharp drop in gasoline prices did not lure Americans back to the mall. A measure of inflation at the producer level, the Producer Price Index, fell 0.4 percent in September on the back of cheaper oil.
 Prices for many other products stayed high; outside of energy products, businesses and wholesalers paid 0.4 percent more for finished goods in September than in August, according to the Labor Department.
 In the last year, producer prices are up 8.7 percent; ''core'' prices, which exclude gasoline and food, rose 4 percent in the last year.
 Still, economists suggested that as the economy slowed and oil got cheaper, inflation would be less of a worry. ''You've got all the ingredients for a big drop in inflation going forward,'' Mr. Harris said.
 A measure of conditions in the manufacturing industry, released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on Wednesday, plunged to the lowest level since the survey began in 2001. The Empire State survey dropped to minus 24.6 points as demand for factory orders plummeted in October. The reading was at minus 7.4 in September.

HEADLINE: Mortgage Inquiries Focusing On Florida

BYLINE: By LYNNLEY BROWNING

 BODY:
Federal prosecutors and investigators, under pressure to scrutinize possible mortgage fraud by financial companies, have opened 151 criminal cases since last October, most of them in southern Florida, according to a new study of government data.
 The study, released Wednesday by researchers at the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University, is based on fresh data obtained from the Justice Department, which has a new program to track criminal mortgage fraud by lenders and financial companies. 
 Because the Justice Department only recently began tracking mortgage fraud as a separate category, there is no comparative data for previous years, and thus no indication of how much, or whether, the 151 cases represent a significant increase amid the subprime debacle. 
 The data covers the first 10 months of the 2008 fiscal year, October 2007 through July 2008, a period when the deflation of the subprime lending bubble accelerated and foreclosures mounted. It does not cover efforts at the state level to scrutinize possible mortgage fraud. 
 Over all, there is no centralized effort by regulators or the private sector to track the total extent of possible mortgage fraud nationwide, a gap that has drawn criticism from some policy analysts.
 Nearly half of the federal prosecutions, or 71, are being carried out by the F.B.I., which opened preliminary mortgage fraud inquiries last month into Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers and the American International Group. 
 The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, which regulates the nation's banks, was the second most active investigator, handling one in five of the cases.
 The data shows that despite the indications of possible mortgage fraud, federal prosecutors have narrowly focused their efforts and opened criminal cases in only 10 of the 89 judicial districts across the 50 states, in California, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Vermont.
 Only a fraction of the cases now being prosecuted have been completed, resulting in convictions or settlements, but the actual number is likely to be higher because of delays by courts in reporting outcomes. 
 The researchers did not indicate how the Justice Department defined mortgage fraud.
 The F.B.I., which has publicly taken the lead in investigating mortgage fraud, has said that the schemes it is investigating involve material misstatements, misrepresentations or omissions relied upon by an underwriter or lender to finance, purchase or insure a loan. 
 In addition to the major cases, the F.B.I. is working with other federal, state and local agencies on about 1,400 investigations into smaller companies and individuals who are suspected of mortgage fraud, nearly double the level of 2005. 
 Nearly half, or 69, of the federal cases are being handled by prosecutors' offices in southern Florida, a flash point of falling housing prices. The second-busiest region is the Pittsburgh area in western Pennsylvania, where 24 prosecutions are taking place. 
 Southern and central California, northern Georgia and southern New York were next, each with an average of 10 cases. 
 David Burnham, the co-director of the clearinghouse, said that ''we don't have any trends, because this data is just the first 10 months.'' But in a statement, he and his co-director, Susan B. Long, said that ''given the broad troubles now confronting the economy of the United States, and the role that mortgage fraud may have played in these problems, the relatively small number of cases in this area is somewhat surprising.'' For example, they said, during the same period, United States attorneys prosecuted far more cases, 554, involving simple drug possession. 
 Mr. Burnham also said there had been five times as many filings by financial institutions describing possible mortgage fraud in October 2006 as there were in October 2002.

HEADLINE: The Ice Storm

BYLINE: By GAUTI KRISTMANNSSON. 
Gauti Kristmannsson is an associate professor of translation studies at the University of Iceland.

DATELINE: Reykjavik, Iceland 

 BODY:
 ICELANDERS have woken up in a new novel by Franz Kafka, where everybody is guilty by default. One by one, the mighty banks have been seized by the government, and Icelanders, aghast, have been told that each and every one of us owes millions of dollars -- to whom, we don't know. The earnest faces of the politicians, of bankers and tycoons almost crying, give us the final touch of the surreal. The situation is comparable only with the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the 9/11 attacks -- something final and yet beyond one's individual grasp has happened. 
 This time, however, instead of looking on we are in the middle of it. The first 500 bankers have lost their jobs in one go; many others are waiting for the double blow of unemployment and losing their house as their mortgage payments soar. When the Reykjavik stock exchange reopened on Tuesday after three days of suspended trading, its index, dominated by bankrupt financial institutions, had lost 75 percent of its value. 
 Suddenly, there are lines in the bank for foreign currencies, and there is a limit on how much we can get -- overseas banks are refusing to accept our freefalling currency, the krona. One of my students, studying in Spain, can't get money from Iceland for her rent. Importers and exporters can't get currency to conduct business. Icelandic tourists abroad have problems getting cash from A.T.M.'s. The British government has applied terrorist laws to freeze the assets of an Icelandic bank; the list goes on as if it were a script for the nightmare of globalization.
 We thought we had friends, in Europe and in the United States. They were sought in the hour of need and found to be busy with their own problems; only the Scandinavians were prepared to extend a helping hand, and then, all of a sudden, Russia -- somehow the world has changed. The disappointment with our old ''friends'' is great and people ask, did we really behave any worse than the others?
 People joke about going back to the '70s, when there were restrictions on how much currency one could take abroad and the government devalued the krona regularly to reduce spending on foreign luxuries. It wasn't all that bad then, they say, apart from the bellbottoms and high-heeled shoes for men, perhaps. 
 But the jokes are not funny, for we did join the party in the 1990s, we did pour money into our apartments, houses, cars, gadgets, stocks; the money was borrowed, too. After an era of deprivation, we were eager to enjoy the newfound freedoms of capitalism and credit cards. We believed everything would add up; certainly the free-market enthusiasts told us so time and again. And most of us could pay our mortgages and credit cards, at least until last week. 
 Now that we don't know if we can, the shock is so strong that neither anger nor sorrow have really taken hold. We thought Iceland was an independent country that could take care of itself without the help of Russia or the International Monetary Fund, that our currency amounted to something, that we could own companies and banks all over the world. We thought we could enjoy our beautiful country and clean air in the backyard of the aluminum smelter. 
 In many ways, we uncritically accepted the capitalist system, which now appears to have been a gigantic casino without an owner. We did in the end believe that we could get ''money for nothing'' and now we face the fact that we will get nothing for our money. 
 What to do, nobody knows, least of all the politicians, bankers, tycoons; but then again, I heard that a new edition of ''The Communist Manifesto'' will be published here this autumn. Coincidence, of course, but like everything else, unreal. Kafka's Iceland probably has an ending different from anything that we can possibly imagine.

HEADLINE: Infant Deaths Fall in U.S., Though Rate Is Still High

BYLINE: By GARDINER HARRIS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Infant deaths in the United States declined 2 percent in 2006, government researchers reported Wednesday, but the rate still remains well above that of most other industrialized countries and is one of many indicators suggesting that Americans pay more but get less from their health care system.
 Infant mortality has long been considered one of the most important indicators of the health of a nation and the quality of its medical system. In 1960, the United States ranked 12th lowest in the world, but by 2004, the latest year for which comparisons were issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that ranking had dropped to 29th lowest. 
 This international gap has widened even though the United States devotes a far greater share of its national wealth to health care than other countries. In 2006, Americans spent $6,714 per capita on health -- more than twice the average of other industrialized countries. 
 Some blame cultural issues like obesity and drug use. Others say that the nation's decentralized health care system is failing, and some researchers point to troubling trends in preterm births and Caesarean deliveries. 
 Many agree, however, that the data are a major national concern. More than 28,000 infants under the age of 1 die each year in the United States.
 ''Infant mortality and our comparison with the rest of the world continue to be an embarrassment to the United States,'' said Grace-Marie Turner, president of the Galen Institute, a conservative research organization. ''How can we get better outcomes?''
 The data, collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, indicate that the nation's infant mortality rate has been static for years despite enormous advances in the care given to preterm infants. Two-thirds of the infant deaths are in preterm babies. 
 In 2006, 6.71 infants died in the United States for every 1,000 live births, a rate little different from the 6.89 rate reported in 2000 or the 6.86 rate of 2005. Twenty-two countries had infant mortality rates in 2004 below 5.0 infant deaths per 1,000 live births, with many Scandinavian and East Asian countries posting rates below 3.5. While there are some differences in the way countries collect these data, those differences cannot explain the relatively low international ranking of the United States, according to researchers at the disease control agency.
 Preterm birth is a significant risk factor for infant death. From 2000 to 2005, the percentage of preterm births in the United States jumped 9 percent, to 12.7 percent of all births. The most rapid increase has been among late preterm births, or babies born at 34 to 36 weeks of gestation. Some 92 percent of these increased premature births are by Caesarean section, according to a recent study. 
 Dr. Alan Fleischman, medical director of the March of Dimes Foundation, said that a growing number of these late preterm births might be induced for reasons of convenience. ''Women have always been concerned about the last few weeks of pregnancy as being onerous,'' Dr. Fleischman said, ''but what we hadn't realized before is that the risks to the babies of early induction are quite substantial.'' 
 Dr. Mary D'Alton, chairwoman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University, said doctors should not induce labor before 39 weeks of gestation unless there was an urgent medical or obstetrical need. For unknown reasons, the number of preterm births is far higher among African-American women even when those women have access to good medical care, Dr. D'Alton said. 
 There is some evidence, she said, that steroids given to mothers at risk of giving birth early may help. A trial to test this theory is about to start.
 Some economists argue that the disappointing infant mortality figure is one of many health indicators demonstrating that the health care system in the United States, despite its enormous cost, is failing. 
 Although the United States has relatively good numbers for cancer screening and survival, the nation compares poorly with other countries in many other statistical categories, including life expectancy and preventable deaths from diseases like diabetes, circulatory problems and respiratory issues like asthma. 
 Ms. Turner blamed socioeconomic factors like obesity, high drug use, violence with guns and car accidents -- factors that she said could not be addressed by health reform. Karen Davis, president of the Commonwealth Fund, a nonprofit research organization, agreed that socioeconomic factors played a role but said that the nation's heavy reliance on the private delivery of care was also to blame. 
 ''We're spending twice what other countries do,'' Ms. Davis said, ''and we're falling further and further behind them in important measures like infant mortality.''

 SECOND ATTACK BY TALIBAN ON AFGHAN CITY IS STOPPED
 Afghan government troops repulsed an attack by Taliban fighters massed outside the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah in southwestern Afghanistan, the second in four days on that city, the provincial governor's office said. NATO spokesmen said the attack underscored the growing abilities of the Taliban, and Western diplomats said the attacks also demonstrated an increased political sophistication. PAGE A16 
 VIOLENCE SHAKES NORTH LEBANON
 After a string of bombings over the last two months, the streets of Tripoli, Lebanon, are starting to resemble a battleground. At least 20 people are dead, most of them Lebanese Army soldiers, and scores more have been wounded. Hard-line Sunni Islamist leaders have gained followers, above, fueling sectarian violence that has scarred the city and its economy. But this being Lebanon, it is not clear what part of all this is terrorism and what is just election-year politics -- or which of those is more dangerous. PAGE A6

 The all-powerful incumbent in Azerbaijan's presidential election, Ilham Aliyev, won 89 percent of the vote in early results, which is not too surprising considering the opposition boycotted the election in protest, saying the government had drawn up rules that made it impossible for them to compete. The catch? Few in Azerbaijan seemed to care. PAGE A10

 More than 20 members of the Iranian Parliament petitioned their colleagues to impeach the interior minister after investigations indicated that he did not hold several academic degrees that he had claimed.

According to the Constitution, if 10 cabinet members are dismissed, all members must face a confidence vote. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has dismissed nine cabinet members in the past three years.

 Infant deaths in the United States declined 2 percent in 2006, government researchers reported, but the rate remains well above that of most other industrialized countries. The international gap has widened even though the United States devotes a far greater share of its national wealth to health care than other countries. Blame is spread widely. PAGE A19
 BACK PAY FROM WAY BACK WHEN
 Tens of thousands of Mexicans who labored in the United States under a World War II-era guest worker program will be eligible to collect back pay under a settlement of a long-fought lawsuit. A portion of the workers' pay was deducted and transferred to the Mexican government to be given to them when they returned to Mexico, but many of the laborers said they never received the pay.

 DISPUTE STALLS DETAINEES' RELEASE
 An urgent effort by the Bush administration to find a country willing to accept 17 Guantanamo detainees that a federal judge ordered to be released has stalled because of a bitter dispute inside the government. People briefed on the issue said the State Department argued that the Justice Department had compromised diplomatic efforts with a court filing Friday that described the detainees as ''a danger to the public.''

 RULING MAY IMPEDE OHIO VOTING
 More than 200,000 registered Ohio voters may be required to cast provisional rather than regular ballots on Election Day and face challenges by partisan poll workers because of a federal appeals court decision requiring the disclosure of lists of voters whose names did not match those on government databases, state election officials and voting experts said.

 READYING FOR AN OVERFLOW
 At Hearings on Term Limits
 The main City Council chambers has room for 250 people, but an overflow area will be set up for the start of hearings before the Government Operations Committee on Thursday. At issue: Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's proposal to extend term limits to 12 years from 8. Given the level of interest on both sides of the question, the rhetoric -- and theatrics -- may go on for a while. A second day is scheduled, too. PAGE A36 
 BACK WHEN BANKS HAD MONEY
 Amit Chatwani, above, the 26-year-old behind the satirical Wall Street blog Leveragedsellout.com, may get points for his wit, but his timing leaves something to be desired. His book, written under the name Leveraged Sell-Out and titled ''Damn It Feels Good to Be a Banker,'' was published in August. Sales are not what he or his publisher had expected. ''But I'm kind of hoping that people will look at it as a sort of historical document,'' he said, ''a parody of a world that existed until basically a moment after it came out.'' PAGE A33 
 SPORTS
 TIME IS GROWING SHORT
 For Red Sox and Captain
 As time runs out on the Red Sox in the American League Championship Series, it may also be running out on Jason Varitek, the team captain. Varitek, 36, is good at handling a pitching staff, but he had a brutal season with the bat this year -- including no hits so far against the Rays -- and that has created uncertainty about whether he will return to Boston after his contract expires at the end of the season.

 A WIDE-BODIED COOK
 Kris Jenkins, the Jets nose tackle, outweighs most other players in the N.F.L., so naturally his story always involves cuisine. But food means more to Jenkins than it does to most football players, even 350-pound ones. He regards cooking as an art form, an aphrodisiac and a barometer for his life. It reminds him of Sundays full of soul food at his great-grandmother's house. And it shows who his friends are, since he cooks only for people he likes. PAGE B16
 PENN STATE'S THROWBACK SEASON
 Just a few years ago the naysayers were calling for the head of Joseph Vincent Paterno, who began his tenure at Penn State when a fellow named Truman was in the White House. But success works wonders for job security, and an emphasis on deportment -- a number of players have had run-ins with the law -- and improved recruiting have produced an unbeaten team for a coach without a contract for next season.

 Retail sales fell 1.2 percent in September, the sharpest drop in years, as consumers cut back spending for a third consecutive month. The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, warned in a speech that a recovery ''will not happen right away.'' And on Wall Street, stocks plunged, with the Dow Jones industrial average falling 733 points. PAGE B4

 UNRAVELING THE BUNDLE
 Bundling cable, Internet and home phone service from a single provider often results in one bill that is lower than paying for the services separately.

But there are steps that can reduce the headache. PAGE B5

 It began with a challenge: ''We want the greenest house you've ever designed, but we have almost no money.'' Instead of laughing, the architects gave Thomas Small, Joanne Brady and their two young children a 4,200-square-foot, eco-friendly house that uses crushed sunflower husks (for wall panels and bookshelves) and shredded blue jeans (for insulation) costing about a third of the going rate for architect-designed houses of the size in the area.

HEADLINE: New England's Political Houdini Attempts One More Escape

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn. 

 BODY:
 It wasn't hard to figure out the direction of most of the political action on Political Action Day at the University of Connecticut's Stamford campus early Wednesday afternoon.
 In the airy marble lobby of what used to be the Stamford Bloomingdale's, there was an Obama table with information and bumper stickers for both the Democratic presidential candidate and the local Congressional candidate, Jim Himes, but nothing for the Republican side. The T-shirts along the lines of ''Elect 'That One,' '' the Amnesty International table, the Rock the Vote gear, the young, racially diverse crowd -- all seemed to be a long way from Wasilla. 
 Shortly after 1 p.m., Mr. Himes, 42, a former Goldman Sachs investment banker who is an executive with a nonprofit agency that builds urban housing, bounded to the lectern. He even looked Obamaesque, with his wiry runner's build, delivering a brisk, rather generic call for change, focusing on education, health care, the economy and getting the country back on track. 
 Before this young audience, he didn't feel a need to mention his opponent, Christopher Shays, the 21-year incumbent, who should count as the Houdini of Northeastern politics. But no one's missing the main story line in one of the most closely watched Congressional races in the country. 
 The only remaining Republican House member in Connecticut -- in fact, the last one standing in any New England state (though it's a stretch to think of Fairfield County as New England) -- Mr. Shays finds himself in campaigns that are like ''Groundhog Day.'' In 2004 and 2006, facing an increasingly Democratic electorate increasingly hostile to the Bush administration and the war in Iraq, he was a prime target of national Democrats. And twice -- even during the Democratic Congressional landslide of 2006 -- he managed to hang on as other Republicans in contested districts were sent home. So the big question is no secret: Is this the year the tidal forces swamping Republicans outside solid red districts finally sweep away Mr. Shays, or does he escape again?
 Mr. Himes, a Rhodes scholar and a former chairman of the Democratic town committee in Greenwich, said that this year Mr. Shays faces voter hostility not just on Iraq, but also on the economic meltdown. He argues that the latter will hurt even more than the former.
 ''This district came to understand Chris Shays's position on the war over a period of years, and it almost cost him his job,'' he said. ''This year, in addition to that, people see he's been asleep at the wheel as well with regard to the economy. He's been a full-throated supporter of the Bush tax cuts. He's supported the Bush economic policies, lock, stock and barrel, for all to see.''
 Mr. Shays once again will argue that he's hardly a Bush clone (his campaign cites a Congressional Quarterly study that showed he voted with his party 65 percent of the time over the past four years, among the least partisan records in Congress). 
 You could certainly make the case that this should be Mr. Shays's toughest election year. It's not just two years on, with a disastrous economy now added to a disastrous war. In addition, Democrats say, a prime reason that Mr. Shays was able to beat his 2006 Democratic opponent, Diane Farrell, a former first selectwoman from Westport, was the failure to get a big enough turnout in Bridgeport, Connecticut's largest city. With Barack Obama at the top of the ticket, Democrats have reason to believe that that could change, with more urban minority voters joining well-to-do suburbanites who see Mr. Shays as a guy who has gone too far right for too long, not the plucky independent he tries to portray himself as.
 ''I remember when Shays first ran for mayor of Stamford,'' said James Perrone, a psychology professor at the Stamford campus, referring to a 1983 race that Mr. Shays lost. ''Back then, he really was a moderate. Since then, he's sold out and drunk the Republican Kool-Aid. Lieberman too. This year, I think Obama is going to be able to carry Himes along with him.''
 Still, you won't find many people who would bet a lot of money either way on the Congressional race, including Mr. Shays. ''There's a tsunami against Republicans, because people blame Republicans two to one for the economic crisis,'' he said. ''And controversy is the enemy of the incumbent. I know that, and I just have to deal with it.''
 Unlike Mrs. Farrell, Mr. Himes is barely known in the district. Mr. Shays hasn't stayed in Congress for 21 years by accident. And he can argue that his voting record on issues like stem cell research, the environment, fuel standards for automobiles and regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac leaves his record of independence intact. 
 ''I'm the only Republican left in New England,'' he said. ''That's not what makes me unique. What makes me unique is that I'm one of the few elected officials of either party who is truly independent and works on a truly bipartisan basis. That's what makes me effective.''
 Whether he's been so independent and wise on the two big issues, the economy and the war, will be debated in the campaign. On Wednesday, with the Dow diving another 733 points, he stuck by a statement he made in September, used by the Himes campaign, that ''our economy is fundamentally strong.'' But short of some astounding sea change between now and Nov. 4, when people sort through the wreckage of this campaign for clues, this will be one of the races everyone looks at.
 If he wins, Mr. Shays gets a few more Houdini points, and Connecticut Democrats will once again feel like Charlie Brown whiffing the kickoff. If he loses, chances are only the Republicans on the highest ground will have managed to avoid getting washed away.

HEADLINE: Switzerland Rejects Intervention, Expecting Its Banks to Grow Stronger

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH

DATELINE: ZURICH 

 BODY:
As governments in Europe and the United States have rushed to pump trillions of dollars into their troubled banks, the Swiss have thus far chosen to stand pat. 
 Switzerland is wagering that its institutions, backed by hundreds of years of tradition and lots of capital, will not only survive these hard times, but also ultimately thrive.
 The gamble is bold, even risky -- particularly given the Swiss banking giant UBS's $44 billion in write-downs related to risky subprime mortgage securities, losses greeted with a mixture of embarrassment and anger by many Swiss shareholders. At a meeting in February, shareholders upbraided management for breaking Switzerland's conservative banking norms; one even rushed the stage. A month later, the chief executive announced his resignation.
 Today, UBS and Credit Suisse each have balance sheets several times larger than the Swiss economy. If they ran into deep trouble, the Swiss might well find that they did not have the resources to deal with it, as happened in Iceland. 
 But in the face of the global financial crisis, customary Swiss calm is still on vivid display here -- evidence of confidence, overconfidence or the greatest national poker face around. In fact, here in the Swiss banking capital, the word that keeps coming up, among experts and ordinary citizens alike, is ''opportunity.'' The thinking is that with weaker competitors falling around the world, stable banks are likely to emerge even stronger.
 It would not be the first time that a global crisis strengthened Switzerland's discreet bankers. In the years leading up to World War II -- after passing a bank-secrecy law in 1934 that made the country a haven for the wealthy to protect or hide assets -- Zurich vaulted to the top ranks of the world's financial capitals. 
 ''This is the chance to pick up businesses on the cheap, or real estate in America,'' said Michael Dufek, a Zurich businessman. ''It's stirring the pot in a new way, and on the whole, I believe this is an opportunity for Switzerland.''
 Mr. Dufek, 24, was far from an outlier. His views reflected the sentiment voiced by Swiss up and down the Bahnhofstrasse, the so-called bankers' boulevard. The street runs from the train station -- where a statue of the industrialist and statesman Alfred Escher, founder of the institution that became Credit Suisse, stands watch -- to Lake Zurich, passing along the way private banks and publicly traded financial institutions holding assets worth trillions of dollars.
 Nino Giuralarocca, senior partner at Ambition HR Consulting, which recruits for the bank system, called the lack of panic here a national trait. ''People don't generally overreact to situations,'' he said. ''From that point of view, Switzerland has always been sort of a stable island.''
 That does not mean it will remain so. Conventional wisdom says the Swiss, like everybody else, are exposed and vulnerable. Banking is more than just the symbol of the nation. Its economy depends on it, with more than one in 10 Swiss francs generated by the financial sector. It has a population of just 7.6 million people and has chosen prosperous isolation over the support network of the European Union. 
 There has been enough concern in the capital, Bern, that the economy minister, Doris Leuthard, felt compelled to say on Swiss radio last week that the government would not allow UBS or Credit Suisse to fail. The acting finance minister has said she would support raising guarantees for depositors as other European countries -- and tiny Hong Kong, also a financial center -- have done.
 The Swiss banks are certainly not out of the woods. The price of UBS shares has fallen nearly 72 percent from its peak of 71.15 francs on June 1, 2007. They closed on Wednesday in Zurich at 20.08 francs. Credit Suisse, which is down more than 50 percent from its peak in April 2007, closed at 45.9 francs.
 But so far, outside experts say, the Swiss approach appears to be working. Both stocks have rebounded from their lows of recent week. And Simon Maughan, banking industry analyst at MF Global Securities in London, said comparisons between Switzerland and Iceland were off the mark. 
 ''To compare the liabilities of the Swiss banks to the overall Swiss economy is not that relevant,'' he said. ''They've got functioning, stable and growing long-established businesses outside of Switzerland.''
 He added, ''I think we've moved on from the Swiss banks and beating up UBS. The fear has switched away from Swiss banks and into banks with big lending books, and the Swiss banks just don't have big loan books.''
 Zurich's future as a world financial capital in many ways rests on a regulation with a quaint, old-fashioned name: the Swiss finish. This dash of polish burnishing the balance sheets of banks here is a requirement that lenders provide an additional 20 percent in capital beyond that required by the global accord known as Basel II.
 ''Then on top of that, and we don't publish how much, we have a third cushion just for the two big banks,'' Alain Bichsel, spokesman for the Swiss Federal Banking Commission, said. He would not elaborate, but he said Swiss regulators were considering stricter requirements.
 Moreover, in contrast to the wholesale borrowing in short-term markets that has gotten so many big banks in trouble, Swiss banks have a huge deposit pool to fall back on, because of a high national savings rate and the many wealthy foreigners who park their assets here.
 This makes the Swiss far less dependent on the disrupted money markets for their financing than foreign counterparts. Besides Credit Suisse and UBS, the other Swiss banks are financed in a very stable way and say they are attracting even more capital from abroad thanks to their safe-haven image.
 UBS appeared to be in a particularly rocky position this spring after posting a $10.9 billion loss in the first quarter. But experts here and abroad praise the company for its early write-downs and say it has emerged in a stronger long-term position.
 Beat Bernet, director of the Swiss Institute for Banks and Finance said he supported the view that the Swiss banks could come out in a stronger position.
 ''UBS and Credit Suisse have been the first improving their capital base at very favorable conditions,'' Mr. Bernet said. ''They have also strengthened their liquidity position during the third quarter. That's the reason why you don't hear many negative news in the actual turmoil.''
 Mr. Bernet noted that their recent Tier 1 capital ratios -- a measure of a bank's core equity, which serves as a cushion against losses in comparison with its overall risk-based assets -- were more than 11 percent for UBS and more than 10 percent for Credit Suisse. By comparison, HSBC had 8.8 percent, Royal Bank of Scotland 8.6 percent and Barclays 7.9 percent.
 Yet the Swiss regulators did not manage to keep UBS, which owns an American investment bank as well as its Swiss based wealth-management operation, out of trouble. And fear of worse to come is never far from the surface.
 ''If you make a line before UBS with actors and a tourist takes a picture, it would be quite dangerous,'' said Beat Kappeler, a columnist for Neue Zurcher Zeitung. ''From a specialist's point of view, there is no risk, but of course, if every bank fails there are risks to the entire system.''

HEADLINE: Mr. Mugabe's Latest Betrayal

 BODY:
It took a lot of international pressure to force President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe to accept a power-sharing deal with Morgan Tsvangirai, the opposition leader. It will take a lot more to force Mr. Mugabe to respect it. 
 The original agreement, brokered by Thabo Mbeki, South Africa's former president, left too many crucial details unsettled. Mr. Mugabe is now filling in the blanks in a way that ensures that he keeps all of the power. 
 Last weekend, Mr. Mugabe announced that his loyalists would run all of the major ministries, including those that control both the army (which considers opposition activists its main enemy) and the police (who have failed to control or investigate the army's abuses). 
 Mr. Mugabe's generals are reported to be worried about retribution for the campaign of abuse and murder that they unleashed on Tsvangirai supporters during this spring's presidential elections. 
 Unfortunately, political power in Robert Mugabe's Zimbabwe comes from the truncheons and firearms of its security forces. If voters had any real power, Mr. Tsvangirai would now be president and Mr. Mugabe would be out of office. Mr. Tsvangirai defeated Mr. Mugabe in the first round of elections but was forced to withdraw from the runoff by army-backed thugs.
 Mr. Tsvangirai rightly says he won't serve in a government that shuts his party out of both major security ministries. He has agreed to emergency negotiations led by Mr. Mbeki. We have long been dismayed by Mr. Mbeki's overt pro-Mugabe bias. The only way he can save his deal and some shred of his reputation is by going back to the core principle of power-sharing, this time with all the relevant details spelled out and guaranteed.
 Restoring (or improving on) those terms will take renewed diplomatic pressure and sanctions from the United States, the European Union and, most importantly, from the rest of Africa, starting with the new South African government. There must be no international recognition of any cabinet that leaves Mr. Mugabe fully in control of the security ministries. 
 Until there is a fair agreement, the army generals and cronies blocking a fairer deal must be denied visas to travel abroad. Their foreign bank accounts and other assets must be frozen. Their stonewalling should not come cost-free. 
 It has not been cost-free for the rest of Zimbabwe's people, who must continue to cope with desperate food shortages and the world's highest inflation rate. The faster Mr. Mugabe and his generals are distanced from power, the faster Zimbabwe can be rescued from the disaster he has inflicted on it.

HEADLINE: Trying to Uphold Coney Island's Character, City Buys Wonder Wheel Site

BYLINE: By JENNIFER 8. LEE

 BODY:
New York City has bought the one-acre site of the Wonder Wheel for $11 million as part of the Bloomberg administration's plan to preserve the historic character of Coney Island, the city announced on Wednesday.
 The city said that it expected to acquire additional land from local owners in the coming months.
 The property joins the Cyclone roller coaster and Steeplechase Park in bringing the total of city-owned land in the area to four acres out of the nine it hopes to protect. The land would be designated as parkland, limiting further redevelopment yet allowing for recreational activities like rides and restaurants. 
 Much of the area is currently designated under a highly restrictive zoning category, known as C7, that permits only large amusement rides. This has contributed to the area's decline, as many amusement properties that have closed have not been replaced or redeveloped.
 The city plans to begin a seven-month rezoning process late this year or early next year. ''It would be optimal to have as much support as possible,'' said Seth Pinksy, president of the Economic Development Corporation, the agency that handled the negotiation for the city.
 He said that by the time the process was completed, he hoped to have support ''from all the local players.''
 The Wonder Wheel Amusement Park property had been in contract with Thor Equities, an investment company that has clashed with the city over the future of the historic seaside district.
 The deal with Thor, which has invested more than $100 million in buying up Coney Island property, fell through about three months ago, said Christopher F. McGratty, chairman of Ward Realty, owner of the site.
 ''We went to the closing table with everything ready,'' said Mr. McGratty, who is the grandson of William J. Ward, a 19th-century Coney Island pioneer. ''Thor failed to close, then they wanted to renegotiate the contract, and we couldn't come to an agreement.'' 
 As a result, Thor forfeited its deposit. Several weeks ago the Ward family began negotiating with the city, which bought the property for the same price that Thor had agreed to.
 A Thor Equities spokesman did not immediately return a call for comment. ''We have made it clear that we are very interested in doing this in a way that benefits everyone,'' Mr. Pinsky said.. ''I think this is an example of our ability to accomplish this.''
 The city and Thor Equities, the largest landowner in the area, had been at loggerheads despite a proposed compromise by the Bloomberg administration to shrink the city-owned amusement area that would be protected in perpetuity to 9 acres from 15. ''We continue to stand behind the rezoning framework,'' Mr. Pinsky said. ''We think it's the right plan for Coney Island both from an amusement perspective and for the larger community.''
 The chairman of Thor, Joseph J. Sitt, who grew up in nearby Gravesend, had developed his own $1.5 billion proposal for the area, which involved a much more elaborate area of amusements, stores and condominiums. In recent months, Mr. Sitt seemed willing to wait for the arrival of the next mayor, but that strategy has been complicated by Mr. Bloomberg's attempt to seek a third term.
 Mr. McGratty said that the purchase would help achieve the goal of preserving the character of Coney Island. ''The family is really happy to see the city step up and maintain grandpa's vision,'' Mr. McGratty said.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 18, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article and a headline in some editions on Thursday about New York City's purchase of land in Coney Island, Brooklyn, referred incorrectly to the one-acre parcel. It is inside Wonder Wheel Amusement Park, but it is not the site of the Wonder Wheel itself. (That land is still owned by the Vourderis family, which operates the ride.)

HEADLINE: Botox Hits Men Right in the Brow

BYLINE: By SETH KUGEL

 BODY:
FIVE years ago, when a fourth horizontal line appeared on the forehead of Cody E. Lee, he knew he had his family's wrinkle gene. Both his mother and maternal grandfather had deeply furrowed foreheads, so he could see what the future held. 
 ''That was the point at which I said, 'I'm going to get some help here,' '' said Mr. Lee, who is 40 and manages a small business in San Francisco. ''I think it's fine having some lines or wrinkles on your face, but I wanted to avoid those deep impressions.'' 
 Not so long ago, those wrinkles (or transverse forehead rhytides, as plastic surgeons and dermatologists call them) might have been thought of as masculine signs of wisdom or maturity. But that sentiment appears to be changing as doctors report a steady stream of men signing up for Botox injections. 
 Many of those male patients, including Mr. Lee, appear to be pleased with the results. 
 With regular treatments, Mr. Lee said his forehead is in the clear. Gone are the days when colleagues would ask if he had gotten enough sleep the night before. Now they say he looks younger than he did in an office party photo taken eight years ago. 
 Though the off-label use of Botox (the commercial name for diluted botulinum toxin) to treat wrinkles has been around since the mid-'90s, the number of people seeking the treatment rose sharply when the Food and Drug Administration approved it in 2002 to lessen the glabellar lines between the eyebrows.
 In 2001, doctors performed 856,000 cosmetic Botox procedures, including 106,000 on men, according to statistics from the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. In 2007, 4.6 million procedures were performed, of which about 300,000 were on men. (Many doctors who watched the recent vice-presidential debate are convinced that Joe Biden may be one of those men who use Botox, though the Biden camp has denied it.)
 Still, the idea of men using Botox, which is made by Allergan, is hardly mainstream. 
 ''I don't think there is anything wrong with aging,'' said Manish Pandit, a 38-year-old from Jersey City who works in technology on Wall Street. ''The way you look is you. That's it.''
 But for those who are seeking wrinkle relief, there may be more options in the near future. Reloxin, another injectable form of the botulinum toxin, from Medicis Pharmaceutical and Ipsen, could be approved by the F.D.A. by early 2009, breaking Allergan's Botox monopoly. 
 ''There may be others to follow,'' said Dr. Alan Gold, the president of the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery, who practices in Great Neck, N.Y. ''So what you'll find is an increased public awareness of the availability of these products.''
 Meanwhile, Allergan has started marketing more directly to men. There is a prominent pitch on the Botox Web site (www.botoxcosmetic.com), noting that the product ''is certainly not just for women,'' and a pamphlet features the Olympic gold-medal swimmer Mark Spitz, who started using Botox this year.
 Doctors say the most common reasons male patients cite for using Botox include looking better for social and romantic ends, succumbing to their wives' encouragement (or demands), and, perhaps most important, a desire to remain competitive in the workplace, especially for those in finance and business.
 ''In general, the pressures for aging are far greater for women,'' said Dr. Alan Matarasso, a plastic surgeon in Manhattan. ''However, when we see a blip in the economy and how many people are going to be laid off today, you now have a 40- or 50-year-old advertising or bank or media person looking for a job,'' said Dr. Matarasso, who is also a clinical professor of plastic surgery at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. ''People have a tendency to look for vibrancy and youth. At times of economic downturns you will often see greater interest. It really ranks up there with an expensive haircut.''
 The 45-year-old publisher of a New York-based magazine, who spoke on the condition that his name not be used, started Botox treatments when he was 41. In typical fashion, he went in after his wife started having treatments. ''Initially, it was curiosity,'' he said. ''I was starting to get three long lines and I was like, 'That's definitely a sign of aging,' and I thought if I slow it down, that won't be a bad thing. I spent $4,000 on a suit, why not use Botox?''
 Medically speaking, there are only slight differences in the way Botox affects the typical man and woman. The procedure works the same way in both, eliminating or reducing wrinkles by temporarily paralyzing and atrophying the facial muscles that cause them. But men often have thicker skin and stronger muscles, doctors say, and frequently require higher doses.
 What specific facial areas are targeted is another difference. Men are more likely to complain of angry brows and horizontal forehead lines; women are often more concerned about vertical lines that start between their eyes. (Crows feet, alas, do not discriminate.) 
 Other differences are societal. Men are more likely to wait longer to come back for treatment, Dr. Gold said. ''Men tolerate the return of wrinkles better,'' he said. ''They're not as bothered as quickly. Women sit in front of a mirror putting on makeup every day and are acutely aware of changes.'' 
 There are, of course, exceptions.
 Michael Speaker, a 51-year-old medical consultant for a laser company in San Diego, was a hairdresser when he first tried Botox. ''When you stand in front of a mirror for 22 years, you know exactly what you look like,'' said Mr. Speaker, who receives injections every four to six months.
 Mr. Speaker bounced between doctors before settling on Dr. Robert Singer, a plastic surgeon in La Jolla, Calif. His bouncing included one unpleasant experience when a doctor gave him a Botox injection in his lower chin: he developed a lisp that lasted three months.
 SUCH incidents are more likely to be avoided if patients do what many doctors urge: have Botox injections done by a board certified plastic surgeon, dermatologist or otolaryngologist. 
 Still, the bad experience did not dilute Mr. Speaker's enthusiasm. Even though he says he does not rely just on quick fixes to stay young (he eats organic and avoids sugar and caffeine), he is convinced that ''nothing can do the job like Botox.'' 
 Many men are not so enthusiastic. During two recent visits to outdoor bars on Stone Street in Manhattan's financial district, a popular gathering point for financial types who, in their 30s and 40s, are entering their Botox years, only one 32-year-old man said he had tried Botox -- but not for wrinkles. He said he used it to reduce sweating in his armpits, another F.D.A.-approved use. 
 The most typical response was dismissive.
 ''You just have to keep acting young,'' said Nick Chopey, 47, a risk-control manager for a financial services firm in Manhattan. ''You just exercise, and keep the right attitude, and the looks will follow.''

HEADLINE: For First Time in 14 Months, Oil Falls Below $75 a Barrel

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Oil prices closed below $75 a barrel for the first time in nearly 14 months Wednesday after the OPEC cartel, fearing that a severe global slowdown was unavoidable, cut its 2009 petroleum demand forecast. 
 The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries said rich nations were expected to need only 400,000 barrels a day more oil in 2009 than this year. Demand from developing countries was expected to increase by an estimated 1.1 million barrels, with most of that growth coming from China, the Middle East and India.
 Another down day on Wall Street on Wednesday also pressured oil prices, which have tumbled 49 percent since reaching a high of $145.29 in early July. The Dow Jones industrial average lost 733 points on Wednesday.
 Jim Ritterbusch, president of the energy consulting firm Ritterbusch & Associates in Galena, Ill., said oil traders using the stock market as a barometer for economic health were ''undoubtedly'' pricing a recession into the market.
 Light, sweet crude for November delivery fell $4.09, or 5.2 percent, to settle at $74.54 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. It was lowest settlement price for crude oil since Aug. 31, 2007.
 OPEC's report comes about a month before the cartel is scheduled to hold a special meeting to discuss ways to deal with the slide in oil prices, including the possibility of tightening output. OPEC controls 40 percent of the world's oil supply, though analysts say a cutback in OPEC production would probably not drastically alter the downward direction of crude prices.
 A global economic slowdown is forcing consumers and businesses to cut back on energy use. American and European leaders this week announced plans to pump billions of dollars into the beleaguered banking system to jump-start lending, though experts say the damage to the wider economy has already been done.
 The OPEC report reflected the extent of the downturn in developing countries while showing that the appetite for crude oil remained robust elsewhere.
 While total oil consumption dropped in developed countries by more than a million barrels a day as of September over a 12-month period, demand growth from developing countries increased by a daily 1.2 million barrels over the same time, OPEC said.
 Worries about a recession are strengthening expectations that crude oil prices still have some way to go before they bottom out. The trader and analyst Stephen Schork suggested that $50 ''is now within the realm of possibilities.''
 Investors are also watching for signs of slowing American demand in the weekly oil inventories report to be released Thursday from the Energy Information Administration of the Energy Department. The report is a day later than usual because of the Columbus Day holiday.
 The petroleum supply report was expected to show that oil stocks rose 3.1 million barrels last week, according to the average of analysts' estimates in a survey by the energy information provider Platts.

HEADLINE: Airlines Differ on Their Profit Prospects

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
Two of the airline industry's biggest carriers, American and Delta Air Lines, posted third-quarter losses Wednesday. But they gave differing views on what lies ahead for the industry.
 Executives at Delta said the drop in oil prices, coupled with steps to cut flights and routes, might protect the nation's airlines from feeling the brunt of the economic downturn.
 But executives at American Airlines warned that fuel prices could be volatile, and that the fallout from the financial turmoil was showing up in weaker bookings from corporate travelers and those in New York. 
 Delta said that it lost $26 million in the third quarter, excluding special items, mostly because of fuel prices that peaked in July. It earned $220 million a year ago. Delta closed at $7.44, up 1.2 percent.
 American, a unit of the AMR Corporation, and the country's biggest airline, said it lost $360 million, excluding special items, because of fuel costs. It earned $175 million in last year's quarter. Shares of AMR closed down 1 cent in regular trading, to $8.78.
 The nation's airlines have cut about 13 percent of the flights within the United States in the fourth quarter, or equal to the size of a major airline. Tighter capacity is allowing airlines to raise ticket prices on some routes. At the same time, fuel prices have dropped to $2.58 a gallon compared with a record $3.97 a gallon in July, according to the Energy Department.
 Delta said those factors, as well as new fees on various passenger conveniences that were once built into the price of a ticket, have put the airlines in better shape to deal with any drop in demand.
 ''When you think about what you would rather manage at an airline, you would rather deal with demand cessation than $150 oil,'' Richard H. Anderson, the chief executive at Delta, said in a conference call. ''In some respects, with fuel dropping the way it's dropping, we're somewhat hedged against the economic downturn.''
 If current fuel prices remain steady through the quarter, Mr. Anderson said, Delta potentially could earn ''a couple hundred million dollars'' in profits. ''Fuel dropping like a rock is a big offset to the economy,'' he said.
 But American's chief executive, Gerard J. Arpey, was more pessimistic. Current oil prices ''are not really a bargain by historic standards, and volatility continues to be a concern,'' Mr. Arpey said. ''We can't necessarily depend on oil, one way or another.''
 Advance bookings for each airline tell a slightly different story. Delta executives said they expected domestic flights to be fuller in November and December than a year ago, in part because of capacity cuts.
 But American said it expected planes to be less full on its domestic routes. Both airlines said they were seeing slightly less demand for international flights.
 American's chief financial officer, Thomas W. Horton, said bookings by corporate travelers had dropped in August and September compared with a year ago. Demand out of New York is softening more than elsewhere, something American said it expected.
 Meanwhile, American said it had placed orders with Boeing to purchase 42 of its new 787 jets, with options to buy another 58 planes. American joins Northwest Airlines and Continental Airlines as customers for the plane, which is nicknamed the Dreamliner. 
 The aircraft, suited for long flights, is expected to be 20 percent more fuel efficient than existing long-range jets. However, development of the plane is more than a year behind schedule, and the jet has not yet made its first test flight. Production at Boeing has been halted for more than a month because of a strike by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers. 
 In an interview, Mr. Horton said the delays should be well behind Boeing by 2012, when American expects to take delivery on its first planes.
 The switch will mean American will operate an all-Boeing fleet, including the MD-80 series jets made by McDonnell Douglas, now part of Boeing. American is in the midst of retiring its Airbus A300 jets. 
 Mr. Horton said American had not discussed how it would finance the newer planes, but said the airline was making a ''very modest'' down payment for them.

HEADLINE: Eldest Rooney Brother Poised to Buy Steelers

BYLINE: By JUDY BATTISTA

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. 

 BODY:
The Pittsburgh Steelers' muddled ownership picture could clear by the end of the year, with the team's chairman, Dan Rooney, buying out his four younger brothers, N.F.L. owners were told at a meeting here this week. 
 The league is pushing the Steelers to settle their ownership situation. The four younger brothers are also working against their own deadline: they want to sell before the end of the year because they fear an increase in the capital gains tax rate if Senator Barack Obama is elected president in November. 
 Although the N.F.L. has not set a deadline to conclude the sometimes contentious intrafamily negotiations -- which have now stretched into a third year -- some owners have privately wondered why it has allowed three of the younger brothers to continue to own shares of the team while also owning racetracks in Florida and New York that have casino gambling operations, a violation of league rules. That, one owner said Tuesday, is a double standard.
 The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette has reported that at least two of the brothers have recently tilted toward selling to Dan Rooney.
 Rooney and his son Art II met with the league's finance committee last week to update it on their offer for the team, which includes outside investors who have not been publicly identified. Each of the five brothers owns 16 percent of the team, and N.F.L. rules mandate that one person own at least 30 percent.
 Last month, the four younger brothers rejected a bid from the hedge fund billionaire and Steelers fan Stanley Druckenmiller, who had offered an all-cash deal to buy out their shares of the team. That decision followed a meeting of all five brothers with Commissioner Roger Goodell, after which Goodell made clear that the owners of the other 31 N.F.L. teams would do everything possible to ensure that Dan Rooney retained control of the team -- an indication that the owners, who must approve the sale, would reject any other suitor.
 When the four brothers rejected Druckenmiller's offer, they said they wanted to reopen the bidding to others. But the global financial crisis probably means additional bids could be hard to come by in the next few months. 
 Dan Rooney also has a right of first refusal for any outside offer his brothers receive. 
 ''Dan Rooney made it extremely clear that he was not going to be involved in the gambling business moving forward if he was successful in being able to complete this transaction,'' Goodell said. He added, ''That is important to our ownership because it is one of the rules that they are not in compliance with.''
 EXPANDED SCHEDULE DISCUSSED Owners discussed what seems like an inevitable move to extend the regular season to 17 or 18 games. Roger Goodell said the prevailing sentiment was for 18 games because it would allow a balanced schedule. No change would be made before 2010.
 One concern was how teams would develop and evaluate players, especially quarterbacks, with a reduced preseason, particularly with no N.F.L. Europe.
 To address that, the N.F.L. could create a developmental league. And Goodell said some teams suggested playing a spring game -- either intrasquad or against another team -- to gauge readiness. 
 ''The focus was on how do we prepare teams for the season, football readiness?'' Goodell said. 
 Adding regular-season games is one way that the N.F.L. could increase revenue -- it could charge more for broadcast rights, for instance -- which will be critical entering collective bargaining negotiations with the players union. But an extended regular season also raises the issue of severe weather at the end of the regular season, with games being played outdoors in early January in places like Green Bay, New England and Pittsburgh.
 The possibility of expanding the playoff field was discussed, but it has little support. 
 ''I am totally against that,'' the Steelers' Dan Rooney said. ''We have enough games now in the playoffs.''
 LEAGUE TIGHTENS BELT Owners spent considerable time talking about the financial crisis. Roger Goodell said that the league had done some belt-tightening but that he did not expect that there would be layoffs.
 There is also the possibility the league could lower the debt ceiling -- the limit on how much teams can borrow. This is especially critical for teams that are building stadiums. Players have opposed such a move in the past, but Goodell believes they will be sympathetic in the current economic climate. 
 ''I really believe players recognize what's going on,'' he said ''Obviously the developments in the last couple of weeks, there are risks in the marketplace Those risks are shifting to owners.''

HEADLINE: Persuading Companies To Keep Up Their Pitches

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
MARKETING executives may well be the most upbeat people in business, invariably seeing a glass that is half full rather than half empty -- even when some consumers can no longer afford a glass. Now, as leading marketers gather for a big annual conference, it appears that their reputation for making Pollyanna seem pessimistic may be put to the test.
 The reason is of course the tumultuous economy in all its manifestations, among them the drastic slide in the stock market, the accelerating decline in retail sales, the reluctance of banks to make loans, the rise in unemployment and the concerns that a painful recession may be under way. 
 Shoppers who are anxious about their jobs, savings and retirement accounts are in no mood to pay attention to the blandishments of Madison Avenue. That could jeopardize billions of dollars in ad spending -- not to mention the continued employment of almost as many chief marketing officers. 
 Already, there are signs that advertisers are starting to sit on their wallets. For instance, the Publishers Information Bureau reported this week that ad pages in magazines during the third quarter fell 12.9 percent compared with the same quarter a year ago.
 The glum economic news threatens to cast a pall over the conference, which is being held from Thursday through Sunday in Orlando, Fla. 
 The conference is the 98th annual meeting of the Association of National Advertisers. The organization has 400 members that spend an estimated $100 billion a year on advertising and other forms of marketing to sell about 8,000 brands.
 ''It has been quite a roller coaster, to say the least,'' said Robert D. Liodice, the president and chief executive of the association, who is scheduled to speak to the conference on Friday. 
 A recent survey of association members found that ''more than half expected spending to decline over the next six months,'' Mr. Liodice said in an interview, so ''there is a retrenchment'' coming, particularly among ''car companies, home building companies and financial institutions, who will have tough times for some time to come.''
 However, ''we expect a very subdued spending environment, not material declines,'' he added, because of a growing belief that the recent moves by governments around the world to thaw the frozen credit markets ''will loosen things up.''
 ''The questions being asked last week -- 'Were we heading for a depression?' 'Was the economy going to spin out of control?' -- was something I don't recall,'' Mr. Liodice said. ''It was kind of scary.''
 ''Now, I think we will be O.K.,'' he added, ''till we see fundamental growth return.''
 In previous economic downturns, the association was joined by advertising agencies and media companies in recommending that companies maintain ad spending levels rather than substantially cut back.
 ''It takes a level of courage and confidence,'' Mr. Liodice said. ''We know it is very tough to do, especially as one is managing to earnings targets.''
 ''But where market-share opportunities arise, increasing spending into the malaise is a very proven strategy,'' he added, ''and those who do it are going to be the long-term winners.''
 Needless to say, a long-term perspective is difficult to assume when the word ''crisis'' appears daily in the financial media.
 Andrew Robertson, the president and chief executive at BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, likened current conditions to ''standing on the burning bridge'' and described them as ''crazy, crazy.''
 Still, Mr. Robertson, who is also scheduled to address the conference on Friday, made a case for staying the course on marketing spending.
 ''If there has ever been a good time to look for incremental volume opportunities, it has to be now,'' he said, even if those opportunities ''vary client by client, brand by brand, country by country.''
 Mr. Robertson plans to discuss the results of a global study conducted by BBDO on the daily ''rituals'' of consumers and how marketers can ''identify additional roles for their brands'' in the everyday lives of target audiences.
 ''It is definitely true the nature of what information is valuable to consumers changes at a time like this,'' Mr. Robertson said, but consumers will still ''engage, and stay engaged, with communications they find valuable and useful.''
 Also among the 1,200 people registered for the conference is Nancy Hill, the president and chief executive of the American Association of Advertising Agencies, the trade organization that is the agency industry's counterpart of the organization for marketers.
 ''I've been spending a lot of time out with the agencies'' since the economy became Topic A, Ms. Hill said, ''and they say most clients understand that eliminating their advertising and marketing budgets during these times doesn't make sense because if you maintain budgets, you can gain market share during this kind of situation.''
 ''Nobody has said it's going to be horrendous,'' Ms. Hill said, referring to ad budgets for 2009, which most marketers are now planning.
 ''But there's no question there will be more focus on every dollar spent,'' she added.
 One bright spot for the marketer association is that the registration of 1,200 represents only the second time the annual conference has been sold out. The first came last October, when the conference was held in Phoenix.
 Several marketing executives scheduled to speak at the conference should have some enlightening war stories to share because they are responsible for brands in the financial sector. Among them are Claire M. Bennett of American Express, Anne Finucane of Bank of America, Becky Saeger of Charles Schwab and Nick Utton of E*Trade.
 Among the other marketing executives overseeing blue-chip brands who are on the agenda are Mark Addicks of General Mills; Joaquin Hidalgo of Nike; Lisa Klauser of Unilever; Michael Mendenhall of Hewlett-Packard; James R. Stengel, who is retiring from his post at Procter & Gamble, the world's largest advertiser; and Joseph V. Tripodi of Coca-Cola.

HEADLINE: Home Prices Are Seen as Far From Bottom

BYLINE: By VIKAS BAJAJ; Tara Siegel Bernard contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The American housing market, where the global economic crisis began, is far from hitting bottom.
 Home prices across much of the country are likely to fall through late 2009, economists say, and in some markets the trend could last even longer depending on the severity of the anticipated recession. 
 In hard-hit areas like California, Florida and Arizona, the grim calculus is the same: More and more homes are going up for sale, but fewer and fewer people are willing or able to buy them. 
 Adding to the worries nationwide are rising unemployment, falling wages and escalating mortgage rates -- all of which will reduce the already diminished pool of would-be buyers. 
 ''The No. 1 thing that drives housing values is incomes,'' said Todd Sinai, an associate professor of real estate at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. ''When incomes fall, demand for housing falls.'' 
 Despite the government's move to bolster the banking industry, home loan rates rose again on Tuesday, reflecting concern that the Treasury will borrow heavily to finance the rescue. 
 On Wednesday, the average rate for 30-year fixed rate mortgages was 6.75 percent, up from 6.06 percent last week. While banks are moving aggressively to sell foreclosed properties, the number of empty homes is hovering near its highest level in more than half a century. 
 As of June, 2.8 percent of homes previously occupied by an owner were vacant. Nearly 1 in 10 rentals was without a tenant. Both numbers are near their highest levels since 1956, the earliest year for which the Census Bureau has such data.
 At the same time, the number of people who are losing jobs or seeing their incomes decline is rising. The unemployment rate has climbed to 6.1 percent, from 4.4 percent at the end of 2007, and wages for those who still have a job have barely kept up with inflation. 
 In New York and other cities that rely heavily on the financial sector, economists expect that job losses will increase and that pay heavily tied to year-end bonuses will decline significantly.
 One reliable proxy of housing values -- the ratio of home prices to rents -- indicates that in many cities prices are still too high relative to historical norms. 
 In Miami, for instance, home prices are about 22 times annual rents, according to analysis by Moody'sEconomy.com. The average figure for the last 20 years is just 15 times annual rents. The difference between those two numbers suggests that a home valued at $500,000 today might be worth only $341,000 based on the long-term relationship between prices and rents.
 The price-to-rent ratio, which provides one measure of how much of a premium home buyers place on owning rather than renting, spiked across the country earlier this decade. 
 It increased the most on the coasts and somewhat less in the middle of the country. Economy.com's calculations show that while it remains elevated in many places, the ratio has fallen sharply to more normal levels in places like Sacramento, Dallas and Riverside, Calif. 
 The current housing downturn is much more national in scope and severe than any other in the postwar period, partly because of the proliferation of risky lending practices. Today, foreclosures are running ahead of the downturn in the economy, a reversal of previous housing slumps.
 ''We are in uncharted waters,'' said Brian A. Bethune, an economist at Global Insight, a research firm.
 Colleen Pestana, a real estate agent in Orange County in California, said many people losing their homes in Southern California used to work at mortgage and real estate companies. Many of them bet heavily on real estate by upgrading to bigger houses every few years. Now, many are losing their homes.
 At the same time, Ms. Pestana said, her clients who are looking to buy are having a harder time lining up financing. One of her clients recently had to give up on a home after the lender that had offered a pre-approved loan changed its mind -- a frequent occurrence, according to real estate agents and mortgage brokers. 
 ''I am working harder than I have ever had to work to get a deal together and keep it together,'' said Ms. Pestana, who has been a real estate agent for seven years.
 To cushion themselves from potential losses if homes lose value, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage finance companies that the government took over in September, have increased fees on loans made to borrowers who have good but not excellent credit records, even those who are making down payments as big as 30 percent.
 Those higher fees are generally invisible to borrowers because banks factor them into mortgage interest rates. While the national average rate for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is now 6.75 percent, according to HSH Associates, mortgage brokers say the rates for many borrowers in the Southwest or Florida can be as high as 8 percent, especially for so-called jumbo loans that are too big to be sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. (Those loan limits vary by area from $417,000 to roughly $650,000.) 
 Higher interest rates result in bigger monthly payments, pricing some potential buyers out of the market. For example, monthly payments are $2,700 on a 6 percent 30-year, fixed-rate loan of $450,000. If the interest rate rises to 7 percent, those monthly payments jump to $3,000. All things being equal, when rates rise prices generally fall. 
 This month, Fannie and Freddie canceled a fee increase that would have applied to markets where home prices are falling, but the companies still have many other fees in place. In an effort to help drive down rates, the Treasury Department has announced plans to buy mortgage-backed securities issued by Fannie and Freddie. The government also recently increased the amount of loans the companies can buy and hold.
 Still, those efforts will take time to have an impact and it is not clear whether they will be sufficient to get banks to lend more freely, especially in areas where jumbo loans make up a bigger percentage of lending, like New York and parts of California and Florida. Economists say that prices in those places will probably fall further. 
 In some of those places, price declines are being driven by a sharp increase in sales of foreclosed homes. 
 Hudson & Marshall, a Dallas-based auctioneer that holds sales for lenders, reports that banks are accepting prices that they refused to consider just 12 months earlier. In a recent auction of 110 foreclosed homes in the Las Vegas area, for instance, the auctioneer's clients accepted 90 percent of the bids submitted by buyers, up from 60 percent a year earlier, said David T. Webb, a co-owner of the company. 
 Single-family home prices in Las Vegas have already fallen 34 percent from their peak in the summer of 2006, according to the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller home price index. Prices in San Diego have fallen 31 percent since late 2005.
 While those declines have been painful to homeowners in those cities, economists said the quick decline might help the markets reach bottom faster than in previous housing cycles, said Edward E. Leamer, an economist at the University of California, Los Angeles. In a previous boom, home prices peaked in the Los Angeles area in 1990 but did not hit bottom until 1996. Prices remained near that low for more than a year before starting to climb again. 
 ''In some areas of California, we are really at appropriate levels,'' Mr. Leamer said of current home prices. But he added: ''The risk is that we are going to get some overshooting, meaning that prices will be lower than they ought to be.''
 In Florida, Jack McCabe, a real estate consultant, said that while some cities, like Fort Myers, are showing tentative signs of a rebound, others like Miami and Fort Lauderdale are still under pressure. Two homes on his street in Fort Lauderdale that sold for about $730,000 apiece in 2005 recently sold for $400,000 -- a 44 percent decline. 
 ''The rocket has run out of fuel, and now it's plunged back down to earth,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Asia Stocks Drop Dramatically in Early Trading

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

DATELINE: HONG KONG 

 BODY:
Asian stock markets appeared to be headed for another rough session on Thursday, with the Nikkei 225 index dropping dramatically in early trading. 
 The key Japanese index was down 9.6 percent, or 920 points, at 8,624 by mid-morning, echoing similar blood-letting last week, and erasing an extraordinary 14 percent rebound Tuesday on the back of the global efforts to stabilize the teetering financial system.
 The picture on Thursday was little better in South Korea, where the Kospi dropped 7 percent. Stocks in Hong Kong, Australia and Singapore were each down more than 6 percent, and Taiwan was 3.2 percent lower.
 The mass sell-off followed the biggest one-day percentage fall on Wall Street since 1987. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 7.9 percent on Wednesday, or 733.08 points, to 8,577.91 points, while the broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 9 percent. Investors on Wall Street -- frightened by the prospect of falling company earnings as U.S. retail statistics provided the latest evidence of economic slowdown -- dumped shares.. 
 The latest U.S. retail data, released Wednesday, showed a 1.2 percent drop in sales in September -- the sharpest decline in years.
 Slowing consumer and corporate spending in the United States is inevitably filtering through to Asian exporters, which are seeing demand for their products seize up.
 Adding to the woes in Japan was the strength of the yen, which has risen as investors pile into the perceived ''safe haven'' it represents. 
 The dollar fell .3 percent against the to the yen on Thursday to 99.64 yen.

TAKING 
 QUESTIONS
 Following is the first set of answers from the editors of the soon-to-be-released ''Gastropolis: Food and New York City'' (Columbia University Press), Annie Hauck-Lawson and Jonathan Deutsch, who will answer readers' questions on the history and culture of food in the city through Friday. 
 Q: How did New York become so famous for the wonderful drink known as the egg cream? And why are there no eggs in it? Jeff 
 A: A classic egg cream as it is known today is a mixture of Fox's u-bet chocolate syrup, milk and seltzer.
 How it got its name, whether or not there was ever egg or actual cream and other aspects of its form, past and present, are not definite. The controversy is discussed in Jennifer Berg's chapter ''From the Big Bagel to the Big Roti?: The Evolution of New York City's Jewish Food Icons'' in Gastropolis. 
 Q: Joseph Mitchell describes a New York event called a ''beefsteak'' (''All You Can Hold for Five Bucks'' in McSorley's Wonderful Saloon) that went on from the late 1800s until past when he wrote. 
 These would be held at restaurants and were basically all-you-can-eat affairs with preset menus and a truckload of meat. When did these die out in New York? Is there any place where they are still done? Bob V.
 A: Beefsteaks were just one of numerous food and drink events of turn-of-the-20th-century New York that also included banquets, picnics, boat rides and ice cream socials. Many of these events were intended to curry political favor.
 While the tradition declined in the city, beefsteaks (and not the tomato) are alive and well across the river in New Jersey. Participants are usually served unlimited amounts of grilled beef on bread, with beer being the beverage of choice to wash it all down.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Asks Recovery Of Bonuses At A.I.G.

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER and VIKAS BAJAJ

 BODY:
New York's attorney general demanded on Wednesday that the American International Group recover bonuses and other payments from its former executives, lest he take formal action against the insurer.
 Recently bailed out by the federal government, A.I.G. is afloat only because of billions of dollars in government loans. With more and more taxpayer money committed, Congress and others have expressed outrage over high pay in general at financial firms and in particular at some of the perks that have come to light at A.I.G. 
 The attorney general, Andrew M. Cuomo, made his demand in a letter to A.I.G.'s board, citing ''unwarranted and outrageous expenditures'' by the company as contrary to New York law. The letter, which described a lavish golf outing and an overseas hunting trip that cost nearly $100,000, follows other recent disclosures of excess by corporate America. 
 The threat against A.I.G., which Mr. Cuomo announced at a news conference on the street just a block away from the New York Stock Exchange and his office, seeks to recover multimillion-dollar payments to Martin Sullivan, A.I.G.'s former chief executive, and Joseph J. Cassano, who ran the unit blamed for the losses that pushed the company to the brink of collapse. 
 ''A.I.G.'s belief is that they had the party, and the taxpayers will have the hangover,'' Mr. Cuomo said, addressing a sidewalk throng of reporters, camera crews and tourists. He added that his office could bring civil charges if A.I.G. did not work to recover big bonuses paid to executives. 
 His actions are reminiscent of the sweeping attacks on Wall Street by Eliot Spitzer, who was the attorney general before his brief term as governor, which ended in scandal.
 Public anger has grown the last few weeks over executive compensation. Lawmakers in Washington last week criticized the $442,000 that an A.I.G. subsidiary spent on a weeklong resort retreat for top sales staff, within days of receiving government aid. The Treasury Department, in the midst of engineering a multibillion-dollar bailout of the financial industry, has announced that it will limit compensation to top executives whose companies took advantage of federal aid. 
 ''People are outraged that these large businesses have shafted the shareholders, that's why were seeing this,'' said Kenneth N. Klee, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. ''And rightly so.''
 In his letter, Mr. Cuomo pointed to payments made even as A.I.G.'s losses were mounting. 
 ''The board awarded its chief executive officer a cash bonus of over $5 million and a golden parachute worth $15 million,'' Mr. Cuomo wrote. ''Similarly, in February 2008, a top-ranking executive who was largely responsible for A.I.G.'s collapse was terminated, but still permitted by the board to keep $34 million in bonuses. This same individual apparently continued to receive $1 million a month from the company until recently.''
 Mr. Cuomo was apparently referring to Mr. Sullivan, the former chief executive at A.I.G., and to Mr. Cassano, who ran A.I.G. Financial Products, the company unit that was heavily involved in the complex financial transactions that led to billions of dollars in losses. 
 An A.I.G. spokesman, Nick Ashooh, said the company had received Mr. Cuomo's letter and ''will of course fully cooperate with the attorney general's office, and it will get the immediate attention of the board.''
 Two weeks ago, long before Mr. Cuomo's letter was sent, the company began reviewing all expenses and activities, Mr. Ashooh added.
 Lawyers for Mr. Sullivan, who was ousted in June, and Mr. Cassano, who resigned in February, did not return calls on Wednesday. In his letter, Mr. Cuomo went on to cite golf and hunting trips that executives at A.I.G. took after the government extended an $85 billion line of credit to the insurance company, which has since obtained additional financing from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. 
 A handful of A.I.G. officials flew to England on a private jet for a partridge hunt that reportedly cost about $90,000. The use of the plane cost about $17,000, according to a person familiar with Mr. Cuomo's investigation.
 Mr. Cuomo's demand rests on a provision of New York law that allows creditors to challenge any payment by a company if the company did not get adequate value in exchange. In this case, the argument would be that the executives took millions of dollars in compensation and severance but did not provide service worth the money.
 ''Obviously, it's a question of proof,'' said Jim Cohen, a law professor at Fordham University. Lawyers for the attorney general, in the name of creditors of A.I.G. -- say, the people of New York to whom the company may owe taxes -- would try to convince a judge of how little executives' services were worth. 
 ''It's a difficult situation, because you're going to have to get into what the market was,'' Professor Klee said. He added that if Mr. Cuomo's tactic worked, creditors might try to use it in other contexts to pursue highly paid executives, like those who worked at Lehman Brothers, now in bankruptcy proceedings.
 ''It's not going to be easy litigation,'' he said, ''but it certainly could be brought.''

HEADLINE: City Said to Explore Rise In Personal Income Tax

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
City officials are considering an increase in the city's personal income tax as they confront multibillion-dollar budget gaps in coming years, Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn said on Wednesday.
 In remarks to the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit civic association, Ms. Quinn said that even after the city rolls back a 7 percent property tax cut it enacted last year and agencies fulfill budget cuts ordered for this fiscal year and next, the city would still have not raised enough to bridge a $5.2 billion gap projected for the 2011 fiscal year -- a figure that does not take into account the effects of the worldwide financial crisis.
 ''Hopefully, we'll be able to find some stuff through creative, different ways, but the truth is, some of it will have to come from tax increases,'' Ms. Quinn said. 
 ''We'll need to look at personal income tax changes, and we need to consider other ideas,'' she said. ''We should try to come up with a mix, whatever the amount is, that doesn't put the entire burden on one group of taxpayers.''
 Raising the income tax has been discussed between members of the speaker's and the mayor's staffs in recent weeks, according to one of her aides, as they try to find ways to offset some of the damage caused by the downturn on Wall Street, which accounted for 9 percent of the city's tax revenue in 2007.
 ''We are reviewing all of the speaker's proposals thoroughly,'' said Jason Post, a spokesman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. 
 The city last raised income taxes in 2003, a temporary rise that ended in 2005 and affected only individuals earning more than $100,000 and married couples with a combined income of more than $150,000. 
 Fourteen states have a local income tax, imposed by cities, counties or school districts. And in five of them -- New York, Maryland, Ohio, Indiana and Pennsylvania -- cities are particularly reliant on local income taxes, according to a July analysis by the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan group in Washington. 
 The personal income tax rate in New York City ranges from 2.9 percent to 3.648 percent, depending on various criteria. In Philadelphia, the rate is 3.98 percent. In Cleveland, it is 2 percent, and in Bowling Green, Ky., it is 1.85 percent, the analysis says.
 Any change to the personal income tax in New York City would have to be approved by the state, which is facing deficits of its own. After property taxes, personal income taxes are the city's largest source of revenue; in fiscal year 2008, income tax revenue made up about 22 percent of the total tax revenue, said Doug Turetsky, a spokesman for the nonpartisan Independent Budget Office. 
 In her remarks, Ms. Quinn presented other proposals -- eliminating spending programs, for example; selling advertising space on the sides of city-owned buildings or garbage trucks; and encouraging business growth by exempting small-business owners and freelancers who make up to $150,000 a year from paying the unincorporated business tax.
 Her presentation was, in a way, an effort to pre-empt by several months a discussion that usually unfolds in the winter, after the mayor unveils his preliminary budget in January and before the Council releases its response in March. Ms. Quinn said she hoped that by doing so, the Council would be able to have more of a say on where spending cuts will come from and how much each agency will have to cut.
 She hinted that tax increases were all but inevitable, though exactly which taxes will be increased and by how much will largely depend on how much the agencies are able to trim.
 But unlike Mr. Bloomberg, who last month ordered across-the-board cuts of 2.5 percent this fiscal year and 5 percent in the next, she favors a more discriminate effort, with some agencies, perhaps, cutting more than others. 
 ''Every agency has to look'' for places to cut, Ms. Quinn said. ''Will every agency sustain the same level of cut? It's too early to answer that question.''
 Among her suggestions were reducing the number of Human Resources Administration workers assigned to a unit that reviews applications for public assistance and identifies which applicants are eligible, which could save the city more than $10 million a year. (According to the speaker, the unit has the same number of employees that it did in 1998, when the city's welfare rolls were at their highest.) 
 Other cuts could come from reducing the city's fleet of cars, saving $30 million a year; and eliminating an Education Department team that tracks classroom progress through data analysis, which costs $13 million a year. 
 In all, Ms. Quinn suggested about $150 million in cuts -- a small amount, she conceded. ''I don't think there's anybody who thinks that $100 million to $200 million is going to be enough to get us out of the fiscal crisis that we're in now,'' she said. 
 ''But what is significant about what I did today is, it is October and we're now beginning a process of articulating what the Council's priorities are, and what the Council's priorities are for cutting money out of the budget,'' Ms. Quinn added. ''We're just starting that today, but obviously, we need to do more.''

HEADLINE: Looking Back, Moving On

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN

 BODY:
MY first Life's Work column ran nine years ago, give or take a few weeks. This Life's Work will be my last regular column. 
 I started writing about this topic just before we knew the boom boom years were over. There were columns about Bring Your Pet to Work Day, and about I.T. workers who could walk across the street during lunch and find a better job.
 Then came Sept. 11. Looking back through my columns in the months after that day, I am struck by how many were an attempt to sort through the ''new normal,'' to suss out whether the fierce determination we all felt -- to relish our lives and back off a little on our obsession with work -- was fleeting or forever. 
 The answer turned out to be somewhere in the middle. The years after Sept. 11 have been marked by a real determination by many workers to dovetail their lives with their work, and a striking accommodation by employers, who have begun to see that flexible workers are at least as productive, if not more so, than those who arrive at the office first and are the last to leave. 
 This march toward flexibility was begun by women -- mothers overwhelmed by the demands of a workplace designed in the olden days, when it was assumed that workers would have a spouse taking care of things back home. Some of those women -- the ones who were financially able -- began to vote against the double load with their feet, leaving the kinds of high-powered jobs that had once been the Holy Grail of the women's movement. 
 I wrote an article for The New York Times Magazine about this, and, as it happens, coined a phrase: opting out. It was published on Oct. 26, 2003, almost exactly five years ago, and it was met by a rush of conversation, not all of it friendly.
 Women who had been soldiers in the fight for equality were furious, at me and at the women I profiled, for turning their backs on the cause. Women who loved their work were angry that other women were reinforcing the impression that women aren't serious about careers. Women who could not afford to just walk away from a paycheck saw this as a class schism.
 When the shouting died down, though, change began to happen. I have long seen that piece as a bottle-opener. There was discontent and imperfection fizzing around the workplace, and the article popped off the cap and let it all spill out. The last five years have seen a jump in the attention paid by corporate America to ways to make work work, not just for women but everyone. Things are far from perfect, but I have spent a lot of time of late writing about all sorts of variations on the traditional model, ''sit in your chair and do your job the way I tell you.'' 
 I am often asked what happened to the women whose choices I profiled in ''The Opt-Out Revolution.'' There were predictions by many who took time to e-mail me that they would be abandoned by their husbands, becoming unemployable caricatures of a '50s housewife. 
 In fact, one marriage did break up, and because it was messy, the woman in question asked me not to use her name here. It was tough for her getting back to work, she said, because she had allowed a gap to open in her resume -- as tough as her critics had warned it would be. 
 Others have less dramatic, less ''moral of the story'' endings. Of the women I tracked down, one, Tracey Van Hooser, a former advertising and marketing executive, is still married, now the mother of a third child and still a stay-at-home mom in San Francisco. Another, Sally Sears, a former television reporter, is itching for a faster pace and plans to go back into television news once her son, Will, starts college in the fall. And Katherine Brokaw is now the dean of students at the Emory Law School, proving that you can take time out and land very well. 
 Looking back at how far the work/life conversation has come in the last five years leads to looking forward and wondering where things will head from here. The economy, of course, will be the determining factor. 
 During the last decade -- while words like flextime and telecommuting were burrowing themselves into the language; while accounting firms were changing their client contracts so that workers were no longer on the road for weeks at a time; while law firms were questioning the tradition of the billable hour -- there was always the question of whether this was fundamental change, or a sop to quiet the complaining. 
 All these programs, like recruiting Wall Street women who had left the work force for a few years, or bringing banking women up to speed on what they had missed when they were out so they could confidently pop back in -- would these things evaporate at the first hints of economic trouble? 
 We've had more than a few hints of late. And some of the companies that have taken the biggest hits -- Lehman Brothers comes to mind -- happened to be prominent players in the life/work arena. No one is suggesting that the reason Lehman failed had to do with the resources spent on progressive recruitment and retention programs. But the sorts of initiatives that make work more family friendly are also the newest, and it is likely that when cuts have to be made in companies, these kinds of programs will be the first to go. 
 I wonder, too, about the women who have left work for home, or have ratcheted back their ambitions during their years of raising children, and who are now scrambling to return to the work force as the stock market gyrates. Can someone who has been jobless by choice possibly compete in this market with someone who was laid off just weeks ago? 
 And, finally, I wonder about the future, when we stabilize to some ''new normal.'' How will the workplace continue to change? The way we work today is unrecognizable when compared with the industrial revolution, and it has little in common with work just a few decades ago. Will Generation Y redefine worker productivity and loyalty, and make it just fine to work from the beach? Will ''retirees'' never really retire, but craft niches within the workplace that allow them to keep doing the parts they love, but jettison the things they don't?
 I have been immersed in this subject for too long to stop writing about it entirely. The questions are rich and the answers are important. It is time, though, for me to change the location and the frequency of what I write. I have started a daily blog called Motherlode on the Web site of The New York Times (nytimes.com/parenting). It is about the ''life'' part of life and work. I will also be writing longer pieces on the subject for The Times Magazine, and periodically here in Thursday Styles.
 Nine years ago, when I was first asked to take on this column, I thought it would be about answers. I figured I would call smart people and ask them the secrets to a balanced working life, and then I would put that in the newspaper and be a hero. 
 It didn't take me long to realize there were no answers -- just endless and penetrating questions. Instead of a ''how to,'' the column became a conversation. I am now taking that conversation online. I hope you join me there, so we can keep talking together.

HEADLINE: Rivals Split, With Joe in the Middle

BYLINE: By ALESSANDRA STANLEY

 BODY:
Barack Obama looked like a prosecutor delivering a polished summation in a long civil case, Joe the Plumber v. George W. Bush. 
 John McCain was closer to a personal injury lawyer, staring into the camera to address ''Joe the Plumber'' as if he were standing by with an 800 number. (''If you or a loved one has been wronged in an accident ...'' or in this case, in an Obama tax bracket.)
 It was the last debate before the November election, the last chance to measure the two candidates side by side. 
 But much of the debate turned into a tug of war over Joe the Plumber, an Ohio man who had an off-the-cuff discussion with Mr. Obama about his tax policies and complained that if he fulfilled his ''American dream'' of owning his own plumbing company his taxes under Mr. Obama would rise. Mr. Obama told him other less-fortunate people needed a tax break to ''spread the wealth.'' The plumber's name was invoked more than 20 times.
 Mr. McCain repeated his name more than nine times and kept looking into the camera and addressing Joe the Plumber directly, as when he said, ''Joe, you're rich! Congratulations.''
 At a moment when conservative Republicans are complaining that President Bush has led the country into socialism with a country-club face, Mr. McCain went on the attack against Mr. Obama for ''class warfare.'' 
 It was Mr. McCain's last chance to cast doubt on his opponent's character and credentials, and he threw the kitchen sink at him -- along with the plumber. Mr. McCain invoked class war, culture war and the Iraq war. He cast himself as a victim of a Democratic attack machine, calling Representative John Lewis's reference to former Gov. George Wallace of Alabama in criticizing the McCain-Palin campaign for stirring up the crowds ''so hurtful.'' 
 They were seated, and this time, Mr. McCain made a point of looking at Mr. Obama, if often with a disdainful smirk and roll of the eyes. He kept taking out his pen to write on his yellow pad, almost as though it were a surrogate for reaching across and throttling the younger man he does not think should be challenging him because, as his aides put it, he hasn't bled. 
 Instead of roaming restlessly across the stage, Mr. McCain roamed restlessly across Mr. Obama's resume. 
 Mr. McCain spoke vividly, and often personally, even mentioning his adopted daughter from Bangladesh in a terse exchange about abortion. He smiled tightly when Mr. Obama spoke, perhaps under instruction from aides not to be grumpy as he attacked on multiple fronts.
 But viewers saw not the happy warrior so much as the harping warrior as Mr. McCain needled Mr. Obama about his relationship with an ''old, washed up terrorist,'' William Ayers, the group Acorn (he said a voter fraud scandal was ''destroying the fabric of democracy''), and Hugo Chavez. With viewers obsessing about their shrinking retirement funds and a drop of more than 700 points in the Dow, Mr. McCain yanked the conversation to free trade with Colombia and vouchers in the District of Columbia. ''Free Trade with Colombia is something that is a no-brainer,'' he said scornfully. ''But maybe you ought to travel down there and visit them and maybe you could understand it a lot better.''
 Mr. McCain succeeded at steering the conversation away from the economic crisis that is the conversation in America, and Mr. Obama let himself be led away. Mr. McCain tried to distance himself from the Republican in the White House. ''I am not President Bush,'' Mr. McCain said. ''If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago.''
 Mr. Obama was calm, but also flat and dispassionate. He looked defensive, smiling and shaking his head as the fusillade of charges came at him.
 Mr. McCain was more focused and had a narrative about Joe the Plumber, but his tone was often sarcastic. He managed to change the subject from the economy, as he tried to woo independent and working-class voters and put himself on the side of the working man. And in this bad economy, he even knows his name: Joe.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 17, 2008

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, the TV Watch column in some editions on Thursday, about the presidential debate, gave the incorrect home state in some copies for George Wallace, whose name was invoked this week by Democratic Representative John Lewis when he said Senator John McCain and his running mate were ''sowing the seeds of hatred and division'' in a way that reminded him of the former governor. Mr. Wallace was from Alabama, not from Mr. Lewis's home state of Georgia.

HEADLINE: Are Big Deficits in Our Crystal Ball?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Big Government Ahead'' (column, Oct. 14):
 While I agree with David Brooks that Senator Barack Obama will probably be the next president, I disagree with his prediction that Mr. Obama will succumb to committee chairmen who want him to create a huge government and keep throwing money after our problems. 
 Mr. Obama understands that many of the campaign promises he made will have to be tempered, put on hold or canceled because of the economic crisis we are in after eight years of Republican control of the White House. 
 Mr. Obama will make job creation the centerpiece of his first year in office. By setting up infrastructure programs to rebuild our roads and bridges, and by making the investment in the development of clean alternative energy, he will put millions of people to work in decent-paying jobs. 
 By giving tax credits to companies that keep jobs here, Mr. Obama will add hundreds of thousands more jobs, which will create tax revenue. 
 That is the best way to restore our economic stability, and Barack Obama gets it.
 Henry A. Lowenstein New York, Oct. 14, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Memo to David Brooks: Big government is also behind us -- eight years' worth. 
 The difference is that this time the average American stands to benefit from critical investments that will pay dividends, as opposed to the gift-wrapped giveaways President Bush lavished on his cronies, wealthy acolytes and insider contractors at the expense of the remaining 98 percent of American taxpayers. 
 No ''backlash''; just a sigh of relief long overdue.
 Jack Luft Sanibel, Fla., Oct. 14, 2008
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks is spot on.
 Whenever one party takes over with a huge majority, the beauty of our system of checks and balances is destroyed and one ideology runs amok. 
 Either extreme -- getting government out of our lives, or big government that runs our lives -- is unhealthy in today's global world.
 This election started out with such promise, but now we're back to extreme left and right. The American people will lose in the long run.
 Marina Re New York, Oct. 14, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Why is Barack Obama's relief plan for the middle and lower classes fanciful and improbable, and by implication inappropriate, while the bailout for Wall Street and the wealthy class is absolutely necessary and responsible?
 Why is it acceptable for members of Congress to have full health insurance paid for by taxpayers, while broadening the coverage to average Americans is fiscally irresponsible?
 Why is it O.K. for John McCain to suggest a huge capital gains tax reduction for big corporations, but not acceptable for Mr. Obama to suggest an income tax cut for those American families that make less than $250,000 a year? 
 Carrie Golkin New York, Oct. 14, 2008
 To the Editor:
 David Brooks's balanced conservatism is a welcome relief from the dogma that usurped the Republican Party leadership after the political failures of Barry Goldwater and Richard M. Nixon. 
 Mr. Brooks underestimates, however, the caution of Senators Barack Obama and Joseph R. Biden Jr. in dealing with the challenges that lie ahead. This is their strength, not their weakness. 
 Whereas Senator John McCain's lurching emotionalism and nostalgia for the greatness that was Ronald Reagan have become turnoffs to voters, not to mention the risks associated with the Sarah Palin element, these Democrats know well that in order to succeed, they must draw strength from both liberal and conservative doctrine alike. 
 The challenges we face, we face together. What their own party's leadership may deny them, they will surely find from thoughtful and wise conservatives on the other side. 
 Gus Nicholson Denver, Oct. 14, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Like the major players in the Bush administration, David Brooks projects into the future without considering the past. 
 Our country needs ''big government'' now because George W. Bush has increased our national debt by 80 percent in two terms -- from $5.7 trillion to $10.3 trillion -- largely through his disastrous policies in Iraq and Afghanistan, his tax cuts for corporations and the rich, and his lack of oversight of the ''fat cats'' on Wall Street. 
 And now Mr. Brooks raises concern about deficits? Imagine where this country would be today if the 2000 election had ended differently. Would the big government spending Mr. Brooks predicts be necessary?

HEADLINE: Schools Spend on Debates, but Gain Prestige

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS

 BODY:
A crew was dismantling the elaborate media tent on the soccer fields at Belmont University on Wednesday morning, with the aluminum doors the last lingering evidence that a presidential debate had occurred eight days earlier on the university's 75-acre campus, two miles southwest of Nashville, Tenn. 
 The reporters and camera crews and morning-show sets were long gone, as was the bunting. But not the bills: the university still needed to solicit more donations to cover the roughly $3 million it spent on the event. 
 ''We're not quite there, but we will be,'' Robert Fisher, Belmont University's president, said in an ebullient telephone interview this morning. ''It's the easiest money I've ever had to raise.'' 
 The Commission on Presidential Debates, the nonprofit, nonpartisan organization that has staged debates since 1988, had already moved its traveling show to Hofstra University on Long Island in preparation for the third and final presidential debate of the current race, set for Wednesday evening. 
 But Belmont, a small Christian-affiliated university (enrollment 5,023) known mainly for its music-business and performance schools, was still basking in the national recognition. 
 The spotlight had last flashed on the university in March, when its men's basketball team, seeded 15th in its bracket of the N.C.A.A. Tournament, nearly upset the No. 2 seed, Duke, in the first round; Belmont was defeated by a single point.
 ''Losing to Duke was our biggest claim of fame, strangely enough,'' Dr. Fisher said, before adding, ''until the debate.''
 The four universities that were chosen this year -- three for presidential debates and one for the vice-presidential candidates -- after a rigorous application process each spent at least $3 million to stage a debate, including the necessary infrastructure and a $1.35 million production fee paid to the commission. 
 The University of Mississippi upgraded its facilities just to host this year's first presidential debate on Sept. 26. When Senator John McCain announced just days beforehand that he was suspending campaigning to address the financial crisis, Ole Miss officials were concerned that they would have been out about $5 million if the debate were to be canceled. 
 Such outlays, not to mention the strain on human resources on campus, might seem a lot for a university to pay for some visibility and a one-time enhancement of its student experience. 
 But consider the potential payoff, especially for smaller schools. 
 Greg Pillon, the marketing and communications director for Belmont, said the publicity value of staging the debate was estimated as of Tuesday to be $21.6 million, according to the company it hired to track mentions of Belmont in the news media, News Power Online. There were 3,920 television mentions since the end of September, he said, and the university's web site traffic had intensified.
 ''Clearly, in the days surrounding the debate, more people learned about Belmont University than ever before,'' Dr. Fisher said, who also took note of the nine-minute debate parody sketch on ''Saturday Night Live,'' which mentioned the site. ''We're on our way to building a world-class university, and this is an event that will accelerate that.''
 Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, where the 2004 vice-presidential debate between Dick Cheney and John Edwards took place, said it reckoned the publicity value of the event at $44 million, for its $4 million ''investment,'' according to Lara Kalafatis, vice president for university relations at Case Western.
 In a survey conducted along with the city of Cleveland and its convention and visitors' bureau, Ms. Kalafatis, who was the campus coordinator for the 2004 debate, said the city had received a $20 million positive impact from the debate.
 Although it was difficult to determine just how much the debate may have spurred student applications or alumni giving, applications at Case Western did rise after 2004, Ms. Kalafatis added. 
 Washington University in St. Louis has been a popular school for decades (tied for 12th in the recent U.S. News & World Report rankings), and officials there say they have not seen a bump in applications from staging debates.
 No campus has been host to more national campaign debates in recent years than Washington University, which held the vice presidential debate this month and three presidential debates in other years dating back to 1992. 
 ''The real impact is on our students who are already here,'' Steven Givens, the university's vice chancellor for public affairs, said in an interview. 
 ''We hear over and over how meaningful it is to have something like this on our campus,'' Mr. Givens said. ''Students often recall whatever their involvement was in the debate, whether it was a great volunteer experience, or in getting a ticket, being on campus and seeing the media here for a couple days. They see this as the highlight of their college careers.'' 
 That enthusiastic reaction was evident when Chris Wallace of the MSNBC program ''Hardball'' did impromptu pre-debate interviews with students.
 The presidential and vice-presidential debates are made-for-television events. Seating in the hall is limited to ensure optimum sight lines for the cameras, and those cameras do not always capture the political buzz spread through a student union, nor a university's specially designed curriculum, or even the related events throughout the host city. 
 Belmont devised a speaker's series for the current term which includes talks by the historians Ken Burns and David McCullough, as part of its ''Art of Being Free'' curriculum. Hofstra already had an American presidency studies program, in addition to its Educate '08 program.
 In 2004, Case Western worked with the Western Reserve Historical Society to develop a political memorabilia exhibit, and sponsored local lectures. There were satellite sites on campus for students who did not score tickets to watch the debate on television screens. Alumni around the country hosted parties. 
 ''When you don't have a sports team going to March Madness, this gave our alumni something to cheer for our university,'' Ms. Kalafatis said. 
 For universities that want to stage a debate, the application process is not unlike the one they put prospective students through. 
 Candidate universities must fulfill all of a strict set of requirements -- from arranging for 750 temporary telephone lines in a media center to keeping the temperature on stage at a steady 65 degrees despite the bright television lights. 
 Beyond that, though, ''we look for something extra,'' said Peter Eyre, senior advisor for the Commission on Presidential Debates. ''It may be a particularly easy facility, a community involved and ready to meet the challenges, or it may be a special curriculum.''
 The sites chosen are not always colleges and universities, but they get the lion's share because of the chance to involve students in the process and to promote voter education. 
 Sometimes, it is the schools themselves that need educating. 
 This summer, representatives from Belmont and Hofstra, both first-time sites, met with officials at Washington University to prepare. ''In general, what they wanted to hear was, are all the requirements necessary?'' Mr. Givens said. ''Our main message is not to assume that this is like anything else you might have done before.''
 Dr. Fisher can agree with that; he said he is recovering from all the excitement of the town-hall-style debate last week. He said he had not decided yet whether the university would apply again in the next election cycle. 
 ''We put together a team of 400 people and students who pulled this off,'' he said. ''Right now, we're all just taking victory laps.''

HEADLINE: Three Guys And A Table

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
The last debate! Couldn't help feeling nostalgic Wednesday night. It was a little like the last bonfire at summer camp. 
 So many memories. That Republican debate where people had to raise their hands if they didn't believe in evolution. The snowman who asked the question about global warming. The time John Edwards made fun of Hillary Clinton's jacket. Dennis Kucinich. Ron Paul. ''That one.'' And now, the sufferings of Joe the Plumber.
 O.K., on second thought, perhaps not quite as much fun as summer camp. 
 For the last two years, dedicated voters have practically lived with Barack Obama and John McCain. We've watched three dozen debates! We've seen them in groups large enough to stage a small invasion, then one-on-one, then at a faux town hall, surrounded by regular people made only slightly irregular by the rule prohibiting any show of emotion. We've seen them debate standing behind podiums, wandering around the stage, and finally -- in a dramatic change of pace -- sitting around a table!On swivel chairs!
 The staggering McCain campaign virtually closed down this week as everybody attempted to come up with a big debate game-changer that did not require an entirely different pair of candidates. 
 Once he calmed down and stopped grinning manically, McCain did, indeed, go on the offensive. He not only managed to compare Barack Obama to Herbert Hoover, he told America that the community group Acorn was ''maybe destroying the fabric of democracy'' with their sloppy voter-registration programs.
 Did it work? Was the audience moved by McCain's description of the plight of Joe, the Ohio plumber, who discovered that the Obama program might mean higher taxes for him if his business were to net more than $250,000 a year? Or were they stunned by the idea that anybody still expects to make that much money in the foreseeable future? 
 For a while, it seemed as if Joe was sitting right there at the table. McCain began addressing him directly through the TV screen. (''If you're out there, my friend ...'') Then, at one point, Obama joined in the discussion with the phantom plumber, and the two candidates for president of the United States argued over whose health care plan Joe would like the best. By next week, I expect Joe will have his own cable TV show. Or at a minimum, a really fancy blog. 
 You had to give McCain credit for spunk. It's been, after all, a dreadful couple of weeks. He built his entire Senate career around low taxes, low spending and a war on those earmarks that his peers use to get special funding for their pet projects. Then suddenly he was in Washington voting to give the secretary of the Treasury $750 billion for what turned out to be a partial-government takeover of the banking system. Not only was he financing a semi-socialist handout to wasteful financiers, the bill was also stuffed with earmarks. Evil, hateful, soul-destroying earmarks!
 O.K., debates done. We're ready to move on. We've compared the economic recovery plans. We know more about Bill Ayers the ex-Weatherman than his mother does. We have developed a tic when we hear the words ''my friends.'' We are really, really well acquainted with Barack Obama and John McCain.
 Neither, to be honest, is everything we were hoping for when this all began. Back to that summer camp metaphor: Obama is like the coolest, most popular camper. You can't wait to see him again after school starts. Then you discover that back in real life, he's founder of the Model Boat Society and the president of the Safety Club. And McCain is like the head counselor who led all the hikes and who you wished was your older brother. Until you realized that he spent the cold weather hanging out at a biker bar and watching reruns of ''Dog the Bounty Hunter.''
 And they've moved on, too. None of their effort during the debate was for those of us who have been with them since the beginning. At this point, they only care about the small chunk of undecided voters in swing states. That means a handful of people in Ohio who have managed to avoid noticing that Obama and McCain disagree on virtually every important issue facing the nation and continue to insist that they are torn between them. 
 Plus, of course, a couple of folks who got picked for a long-running television panel of undecided voters and don't want to admit they've made up their minds because they'll get thrown out.
 This is one of the reasons why the last few weeks of a presidential campaign tend to be so awful. The candidates are gearing their remarks to people who have managed to completely ignore nearly two years of news about the 2008 elections. In the end, it's always all about the ones who play hard to get.

HEADLINE: Markets Suffer as Investors Weigh Relentless Problems

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN; Peter S. Goodman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Stock markets plunged anew on Wednesday, nearly wiping out the record gains of Monday and sending another wave of wealth destruction washing over American households.
 The government's rescue of the banks has been widely embraced, but the frenzied selling, which pushed the Dow Jones industrial average down 733 points, underscored how the economy's troubles are too broad to be fixed by the bailout of the financial system. 
 Investors are recognizing that the financial crisis is not the fundamental problem. It has merely amplified economic ailments that are now intensifying: vanishing paychecks, falling home prices and diminished spending. And there is no relief in sight. 
 Wednesday's rout began in the morning with the latest evidence of the nation's economic deterioration -- reports showing that retail spending slipped in September and broader signs of a pullback among suddenly thrifty American consumers. 
 Selling picked up momentum in the afternoon as the Federal Reserve's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, cautioned Americans that the bailout would not swiftly lift the economy and that continued weakness was certain.
 ''Stabilization of the financial markets is a critical first step, but even if they stabilize as we hope they will, broader economic recovery will not happen right away,'' Mr. Bernanke said in a speech to the Economic Club of New York. ''Economic activity will fall short of potential for a time.''
 By day's end, the Dow had surrendered most of Monday's 936-point gain, dropping 7.87 percent. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 9 percent, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq was down 8.47 percent. Expectations that a worldwide slowdown will reduce demand for oil pushed prices below $75 a barrel. Signs of improvement continued in the credit markets, making it somewhat easier for companies and states to secure financing, but interest rates remained elevated.
 Mr. Bernanke's remarks -- offered in the sober tones of a man cognizant that a stray syllable may prompt the loss of more billions on Wall Street -- underscored the reality that the economy's troubles go well beyond the financial crisis. The United States and many other major economies are almost certainly headed into a slog through economic purgatory, one that could last many months.
 ''People have focused so much on the immediate financial crisis that they haven't realized how much the real economy is going down, largely independently,'' said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. ''I don't think there's a way we can get out of this without a full-fledged recession and a lot of people losing their jobs. All we can really talk about is ameliorating it, making sure the people who are hit have support.''
 On Monday, as the Dow posted its fifth-largest one-day percentage gain in history, some investors found quantifiable proof that the crisis was solved. Yet an unpalatable historical detail complicated that idea: The four previous largest percentage gains occurred from October 1929 to March 1933, in the early days of the Depression. 
 Then, it must be noted, the markets swung far more widely than they do in this era, and an epic collapse would still be required to bring the United States anywhere near a comparable depression. 
 Mr. Bernanke, a leading academic expert on the Depression, offered pointed assurances that no repeat of that disaster would unfold on his watch. The Fed stands ready to use all its tools to battle the financial crisis, he said. He exuded confidence that the American economy ''will emerge from this period with renewed vigor.''
 But when? Mr. Bernanke could not say. That uncertainty added to the gnawing worry gripping the economy. 
 ''Ultimately, the trajectory of economic activity beyond the next few quarters will depend greatly on the extent to which financial and credit markets return to more normal functioning,'' he said.
 Strikingly, Mr. Bernanke expressed concern about how huge amounts of capital are increasingly concentrated in a handful of enormous financial institutions.
 ''The real concern that we have is that we have got and developed, in this country, a very serious 'too big to fail' problem,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''And that problem, we've just recognized now in the current situation, how severe it is.''
 It seemed a curious concern for a man whose central bank has worked with the Treasury to engineer a series of shotgun corporate weddings, such as Bank of America's purchase of Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan Chase's acquisition of Bear Stearns -- deals that have further concentrated money in fewer hands.
 Mr. Bernanke's prognosis and the latest carnage on Wall Street lent urgency to the debate over what the government should do now to soften the blow to the economy. 
 In Washington, and on the campaign trail, conversation centers on putting together a second round of so-called government stimulus spending, following the $152 billion unleashed this year via tax rebates to households and tax cuts for businesses.
 Democrats in the House are drafting a roughly $150 billion package of spending measures aimed at spurring the economy, according to senior aides, including aid for states, large-scale construction projects to generate jobs and the expansion of unemployment benefits. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, the Democratic presidential nominee, is urging $175 billion worth of relief measures.
 The Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, has declined to outline his own proposal, though his senior economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, said he is ''open to any measure that genuinely stimulates the economy.'' 
 Republicans on Capitol Hill have emphasized tax cuts for businesses in any stimulus package, a stance that puts them at odds with Democrats, though recent signs suggest greater potential for a compromise.
 ''We need fiscal stimulus,'' said Douglas W. Elmendorf, a former Treasury and Federal Reserve Board economist, and now a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. ''The outlook is much darker than it was even a few months ago.''
 The checks the government sent to households last summer appear to have kept the economy growing, but economists are skeptical such a course could work again.
 ''The spend rate will be really low because people are scared to death,'' Mr. Baker said.
 When economists met with House leaders on Monday to suggest a course, the favored means appeared to be aiding state and local governments, whose property tax revenues are diminishing as home values fall. Local governments are a crucial source of employment and social services relied upon by the poor.
 ''The states are taking steps right now that are deepening the recession, through no fault of their own,'' said Jared Bernstein, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. ''They're forced to either raise taxes or cut services. Neither of those are where we need to be right now.''
 The crisis on Wall Street has sown fears that banks would hold tight to their dollars and starve the economy of capital, preventing businesses from securing finances to hire people and expand. If the bailout succeeds in restoring confidence, that should eventually get money flowing and lift economic activity.
 But regardless of Wall Street's travails, a broader set of difficulties has been taking money out of the economy, putting the squeeze on American households and businesses.
 The economy has lost 760,000 jobs since the beginning of the year, and millions of workers have seen their hours cut, shrinking paychecks just as plunging real estate prices prevent households from borrowing against the value of their homes. 
 In short, American spending power is declining, and this has become a downward spiral: As wages shrink, workers spend less, and that limits demand for workers at the businesses that once captured their dollars. 
 Many economists now assume that unemployment, currently at 6.1 percent, will climb to 9 percent by the end of next year. Some now envision it could reach 10 percent -- a level not seen in 25 years.
 ''At this point, the thing has probably just got to play out,'' said Martin N. Baily, a chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton and now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''I don't know that there's anything that we can do to avoid a mild recession. The question is what can we do to avoid a very severe recession.''

Obama's Acorn Ties
 Mr. McCain once again sought to link Mr. Obama to the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or Acorn, the community organizing group. Acorn has worked to register 1.3 million new voters during this election cycle and has come under fire from Republicans and the McCain campaign over instances of fraudulent voter registrations. Acorn has acknowledged some problems but not to the extent portrayed by Republicans. 
 At the debate, Mr. McCain said, ''We need to know the full extent of Senator Obama's relationship with Acorn, who is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy.''
 The number of ''problematic'' voter registration cards that have been submitted by Acorn employees is not yet known. But the problem of false registrations is under investigation in several states. 
 Though Mr. Obama said that the group was not working for his campaign, he has sought to draw a distinction between voter fraud and voter registration fraud. He said people with fake names would not be allowed to vote on Election Day. And Obama campaign officials assert that the accusations of voter fraud were an effort to distract attention from what they say are Republican efforts to engage in voter suppression tactics. 
 In terms of Mr. Obama's connections to the group, he represented Acorn and several other groups in a lawsuit in 1995 and conducted training events for its leaders. The McCain campaign also says that the Obama campaign paid Acorn more than $800,000 for get-out-the-vote efforts.
 That payment was made to Citizens Services Inc., a consulting firm affiliated with Acorn. But according to a spokesman for Acorn, less than $80,000 of the Obama campaign's payment to Citizens Services went to Acorn.
 Mr. McCain also has associations with Acorn, which the Obama campaign has been trying to highlight. In 2006, Mr. McCain participated in an event at Miami-Dade Community College that was sponsored by eight groups supporting the comprehensive immigration reform bill that Mr. McCain co-sponsored in the Senate. Acorn was one of those groups.

HEADLINE: The Final Debate

 BODY:
When John McCain embarrassed himself last month by declaring that the ''fundamentals of our economy are strong,'' he quickly claimed that he was talking about his belief in the American worker -- and darkly implied that anyone who disagreed was less than patriotic. 
 For all of that concern, it's a shame that Mr. McCain hasn't come up with policies that would actually help workers. Instead, he's served up the same-old trickle-down theories and a government-is-wrong, markets-are-right fervor that helped create this economic disaster. 
 Wednesday night's debate was another chance for Mr. McCain to prove that he is ready to lead this country out of its deep economic crisis. But he had one answer to almost every economic question: cut taxes and government spending. Unfortunately, what Mr. McCain means is to cut taxes for the richest Americans and, inevitably, to reduce the kinds of government services that working Americans need more than ever.
 Mr. McCain also stuck to his campaign's nasty tone. He could not let go of the ''Joe the Plumber'' parable, saying his opponent's plan was ''to take Joe's money, give it to Senator Obama and let him spread the wealth around.'' Mr. McCain then accused Barack Obama of engaging in the sort of ''class warfare'' that has, in fact, been a focus of his own campaign.
 In another astonishing exchange, Mr. McCain acted as though he was the truly aggrieved party, insisting that he had repudiated all of the attacks on Mr. Obama by surrogates and ''some fringe people'' at rallies. He didn't mention that his running mate, Sarah Palin, is one of the loudest attackers, and he certainly didn't repudiate her absurd, repeated charge that Mr. Obama has been ''palling around with terrorists.'' 
 Quite the opposite. Mr. McCain again raised Mr. Obama's old and meaningless acquaintance with William Ayers, a violent, 1960s radical who served with Mr. Obama on charitable foundations. Mr. McCain ended up seeming angry and desperate. 
 Mr. McCain's biggest problem is that he has no big ideas for fixing the country's problems. His speech on the economy this week was replete with seriously bad ones, starting with cutting the already very low capital gains tax in half. That won't rescue the economy. What it will do is dig the government further into debt while making the current tax structure that rewards the rich even more unfair.
 Mr. McCain made more sense when he proposed eliminating income tax on unemployment benefits in 2008 and 2009. He would have done a lot more for struggling Americans if he had pressed his party earlier this month to help extend expiring unemployment benefits. 
 Mr. McCain says he wants to help Americans threatened with foreclosure by using federal money to purchase loans that exceed the value of the home. A better approach -- one that would not overburden the taxpayer -- would be to allow a bankruptcy court judge to modify mortgage terms. Mr. Obama has long supported that change. Mr. McCain has not.
 Mr. Obama has better ideas to respond to the financial crisis and to put the economy back on the right track. He supports a 90-day moratorium on foreclosures and more money for states and localities, both of which would quickly bring relief beyond Wall Street. 
 Mr. Obama wants to raise the minimum wage and tie it to inflation. Mr. McCain wants to make the Bush tax cuts permanent -- a big break for the top 1 percent of society. Mr. Obama would cut taxes for low- and moderate-income families and raise them for richer Americans. 
 As for how Mr. McCain would create jobs, his big idea in Tuesday's speech -- surprise, surprise -- was that ''the most effective way a president can do this'' is to use ''tax cuts that are directed specifically to create jobs.'' After the last eight years, that pinched view of government ought to sound depressingly familiar to the millions of Americans who are still waiting for that downward trickle of prosperity.

HEADLINE: Cue the Fireworks: Hearings on Term Limits Begin

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN and MICHAEL BARBARO; Jonathan P. Hicks contributed reporting.

 BODY:
The caffeine will flow, extra security will be on hand, and the room is expected to be packed. Some staffers are joking about bringing cots and pajamas into the Council chambers. 
 Thursday opens the most eagerly anticipated hearings in years at City Hall, as friends and foes of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's plan to overhaul New York's term limits law marshal their forces to testify on the legislation.
 The mayor's political operation is showing its muscle, using Neil Giacobbi, director of Mr. Bloomberg's 2005 campaign volunteer operation, to turn out a crowd in favor of Mr. Bloomberg's proposal, which would permit the city's elected officials to serve for 12 years rather than 8.
 Mr. Giacobbi has called on the mayor's network of supporters to show up in droves, writing in a mass e-mail message: ''I need your help again.'' 
 Mr. Bloomberg's measure is expected to be lauded by former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and former Mayor Edward I. Koch.
 Not to be outdone, the Working Families Party is urging those who object to the mayor's plan to show up, too. And to get the word out, the party produced a commercial to air during Wednesday's presidential debate and distributed fliers focusing on undecided council members in their districts.
 No matter what happens, people are already expecting that the hearings will be a memorable moment in the city's political history.
 ''I'm surprised at the tremendous effort going on on both sides, in getting the vote, and in spinning this story the right way,'' said George Arzt, a veteran political consultant and former City Hall reporter. ''We haven't had an issue as dramatic as this in many years. I haven't seen anything like since the 1970s.''
 The hearings start at 1 p.m. Thursday before the Government Operations Committee, in the main Council chambers in City Hall. A second day is scheduled for Friday, starting at 10 a.m.
 Each speaker will be given roughly two minutes to testify. And given the level of interest, there is already pregame speculation and political gamesmanship over just how long the Thursday session will last, and how many people will show up. The chamber can hold 250 people, but an overflow area will be set up.
 Some of the mayor's fiercest critics, for instance, are whispering nervously, perhaps as part of a strategy of lowering expectations, that the session will be dominated by Bloomberg supporters. Others, including Representative Anthony D. Weiner, a Democrat who has been a vocal critic of the mayor, are all but encouraging residents to drag out the hearing until the small hours of the morning.
 Bloomberg supporters are calling upon a Rolodex of notables, past and present, to echo the mayor's argument that in these difficult economic times, continuity and a proven track record are preferable. So, too, are aides to City Council Speaker Christine C. Quinn, who, in an announcement on Sunday that took no one by surprise, declared her support, too. Mr. Koch, a longtime Bloomberg ally and the last mayor to serve three terms, was invited to appear by Gary Altman, legislative counsel to the City Council. Mr. Koch said that he would testify that it takes 12 years for both a mayor and legislator ''to get things done -- not just to see through a proposal but to make sure it takes hold.''
 Other boldface names who are also expected to support the mayor are John Sexton, president of New York University; and Kathryn S. Wylde, president of the Partnership for New York City, which represents major businesses.
 Labor unions endorsing Mr. Bloomberg's proposal will also be present, like those representing emergency medical technicians, sanitation workers, firefighters, police officers and construction workers.
 ''With this very scary economic climate we're in now, I come out with the answer, why deny the public access to Bloomberg, because he has done a good job over the last seven years?'' said Michael Palladino, president of the Detectives' Endowment Association. 
 But opponents are relishing the opportunity to make their case.
 Despite Mr. Bloomberg's popularity, the measure has set off some intense opposition, mainly because voters approved the limits of two four-year terms through referendums in 1993 and again in 1996. The mayor is pushing the Council to change the law without a public vote.
 Richard Emery, a civil rights and election lawyer who helped dismantle the city's Board of Estimate in the late 1980s, said he was invited to speak by a member of the Government Operations Committee.
 Mr. Emery said he is a ''big supporter of Bloomberg'' and opposes term limits. But he plans to testify against the mayor's legislation, arguing that such a change, without voter input, would weaken the City Council and hurt the integrity of city government.
 ''If these council members now degrade themselves by lining their own pockets and jumping into the lap of the mayor, they will have forfeited that 20 years' process of obtaining legitimacy and will slip back, in the view of the body politic, into being hacks, which is what they were always thought of,'' Mr. Emery said.
 Randy M. Mastro, who is representing, pro bono, several elected officials opposed to the term limits extension, dubbed the legislation ''profoundly undemocratic'' and ''blatantly illegal.''
 To Mr. Mastro, a former deputy mayor, the hearing represents ''a historic moment and it will define us as a city. Will we reaffirm our commitment to democratic principles and respect for the will of the people, or are our elected officials going to turn their back on the electorate and say their views don't matter?''
 The loudest and most persistent foe has been the union-backed Working Families Party, whose officials say that volunteers have collected 15,000 signatures for a petition opposing the mayor's plan to change term limits through legislation.
 Dan Cantor, the party's executive director, said that he expected a large turnout at the hearings, even though ''it's not an issue of great salience -- it's not health care or their job. But it's struck a chord.''
 It is unclear how late the hearing on Friday will last, or if the committee will even hold a vote on the mayor's bill. If it drags into the evening, council officials expect that the committee's chairman, Councilman Simcha Felder, a strong Bloomberg ally, to hand the gavel over to someone else, in observance of the Sabbath.
 The entire Council could take up a term limits bill next Thursday, and 26 votes are needed for passage. Though the situation is fluid, a tally of council members Wednesday evening by The New York Times showed 19 opposed to the measure, 14 in favor, and 18 undecided.
 In a decision that was viewed as a setback for opponents, the city's Conflicts of Interest Board on Wednesday ruled that council members could vote on the measure without violating the prohibition on using their office for ''personal or private advantage.''
 Meanwhile, there will no shortage of press conferences and moments of political intrigue each day, and almost every hour.
 A 10-minute panorama on the steps of City Hall on Tuesday provided an apt illustration. First, State Senator Kevin Parker held a press conference to denounce the mayor's bill. A few minutes later, a group of about two dozen ministers took their place, and declared their support of the mayor. 
 As they were finishing their news conference, Mr. Bloomberg showed up, and entered City Hall without taking questions. It would be very unlikely, city officials say, for him to show up or say anything on Thursday or Friday, so as not to distract from the Council.

(PHOTOGRAPH BY ANDREW HENDERSON FOR THE NEW YORK TIMES) CHART: DRAWING THE LINE ON TERM LIMITS: As the City Council opens public hearings this week on whether to extend term limits from two to three to allow Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to run for re-election, the body is divided. Much of the support comes from the Bronx, while much of the opposition is from Queens. A vote could be held as early as Oct. 23.

 BODY:
The final presidential debate was rife with accusations and counteraccusations, claims and counterclaims, many of which were not entirely grounded in fact. Here is an examination of some of the issues raised by the candidates: 
 Fannie and Freddie
 As the debate began, Senator John McCain argued, as he repeatedly does on the campaign trail, that the blame for the financial meltdown lies with the mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which were a unique hybrid -- government-chartered but shareholder-owned -- until they were forced into government conservatorships last month. 
 ''The catalyst for this housing crisis was the Fannie and Freddie Mae [sic] that caused the subprime lending situation that now caused the housing market in America to collapse,'' Mr. McCain said.
 Few analysts of the current crisis trace its roots to Fannie and Freddie, whatever their mistakes. The companies' investments in subprime mortgages, which are those made to borrowers with spotty credit histories, were indeed a major factor in the financial problems that led to the government seizure in mid-September. But most financial experts say the companies actually were late to the game of investing in mortgage-backed securities heavy with subprime mortgages. 
 A new book by an outside adviser to the McCain campaign, Mark Zandi, who is chief economist and co-founder of Moody's Economy.com, suggests that the mortgage companies' investments in subprime mortgages were in part because the Bush administration ''put substantial pressure on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to increase their funding of mortgage loans to lower-income groups.'' President George Bush, who had been elected on a vow to create ''an ownership society,'' was eager to raise the rate of homeownership.
 Mr. McCain has a political interest in tying Fannie and Freddie to the current crisis because the companies have long had close ties to Democrats in Congress, including Senator Barack Obama. James Johnson, a former chairman of Fannie Mae, was a former outside adviser to Mr. Obama, and Mr. Obama in recent years has received more contributions from Fannie and Freddie employees than any member of Congress other than the chairman of the Senate banking committee, Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut. 
 But Mr. McCain and other Republicans in Congress also have ties to Fannie and Freddie, which long were careful to cultivate lawmakers in both parties. Several McCain advisers have been lobbyists and consultants to the two companies, including Rick Davis, the campaign manager. JACKIE CALMES

HEADLINE: Bernanke Says Bailout Will Need Time to Work

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, warned on Wednesday that the American economy was headed toward an extended period of difficulty, despite worldwide efforts to stabilize the financial markets. 
 But he said federal officials had armed themselves with ''the tools we need to respond with the necessary force to these challenges.''
 ''Broader economic recovery will not happen right away,'' Mr. Bernanke said in a speech to the Economic Club of New York, even if financial markets stabilize ''as we hope they will.'' 
 But he said that ''Americans can be confident that every resource is being brought to bear to address the current crisis.''
 Mr. Bernanke, in his remarks, said that because of the worldwide downturn, ''our export sales, which have been a source of strength, very probably will slow.'' 
 The labor, housing and credit markets would also take time to recover, he said, and consumer spending and business investment remained weak.
 Inflation, however, appeared to have ''held steady or eased,'' Mr. Bernanke said, citing the sharp drop in oil prices in the last few weeks. He said that stable prices, coupled with the broader downturn, would probably keep inflation in check, offsetting other problems.
 ''Although much work remains and more difficulties surely lie ahead,'' Mr. Bernanke said, ''I remain confident that the American economy, with its great intrinsic vitality and aided by the measures now available, will emerge from this period with renewed vigor.''
 He added that, ''ultimately, the trajectory of economic activity beyond the next few quarters will depend greatly on the extent to which financial and credit markets return to more normal functioning.''
 The speech offered a chronological account of the financial crisis, with Mr. Bernanke emphasizing the adaptability and innovation of the triage efforts undertaken by the Treasury Department and the central bank. He said that, unlike in past crises, the government had responded quickly and aggressively.
 ''Waiting too long to respond has usually led to much greater direct costs of the intervention itself and, more importantly, magnified the painful effects of financial turmoil on households and businesses,'' Mr. Bernanke said in his remarks. ''That is not the situation we face today.''
 ''We will not stand down until we have achieved our goals of repairing and reforming our financial system and restoring prosperity,'' he said.
 The Fed chairman also touched on one of the third-rail issues of the last several weeks: why the government allowed Lehman Brothers to collapse, the catalyst that set up the latest and most turbulent period of the current crisis. Some have argued that the government should have made more efforts to prevent the investment bank from filing for bankruptcy protection.
 But Mr. Bernanke said that ''a public sector solution for Lehman proved infeasible.''
 ''The firm could not post sufficient collateral to provide reasonable assurance that a loan from the Federal Reserve would be repaid, and the Treasury did not have the authority to absorb billions of dollars of expected losses to facilitate Lehman's acquisition by another firm,'' he said.
 ''Consequently,'' he said, ''little could be done except to attempt to ameliorate the effects of Lehman's failure on the financial system.''

HEADLINE: A Republican Incumbent Finds a Once-Safe Race Less So

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

DATELINE: GREENVILLE, N.C. 

 BODY:
Before this campaign season, Senator Elizabeth Dole was not considered a particularly vulnerable incumbent. As Washington royalty with a gold-plated resume, she won the seat once held by Senator Jesse Helms by a nine-point margin in 2002. 
 But on Tuesday, when Mrs. Dole appeared at a rally for Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, the Republican candidate for vice president, she was appealing for her political life. She told the crowd of party faithful that the head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Senator Charles E. Schumer, was spending nearly $10 million of ''New York money'' on ''negative, ugly, mean-spirited, untruthful ads'' against her, and the crowd responded with lusty boos.
 ''Elizabeth Dole's in a tough race,'' she said. 
 As economic turmoil has driven down support for Republican candidates in recent weeks, several polls have suggested that Mrs. Dole's opponent, Kay R. Hagan, a relatively unknown state senator from Greensboro, has closed Mrs. Dole's double-digit lead or even pulled ahead, and many analysts are now calling the race a tossup. 
 Ms. Hagan is a crucial part of the effort by Democrats to gain a 60-seat majority in the Senate, a margin that could limit Republican filibusters. From Nov. 16, 2007, to Oct. 5, the Democratic senatorial committee spent more than $4 million on advertising in North Carolina, more than in any other Senate race, according to TNS Media Intelligence/CMAG, a political data firm in Arlington, Va. The Democrats have reserved television time worth millions more. 
 The National Republican Senatorial Committee, which has less money, has also spent more in North Carolina than in any other state, $1.7 million. That disparity between parties is reversed when it comes to the candidates' own treasuries. By the end of September, Mrs. Dole had raised $12.9 million, and Ms. Hagan, $4.8 million. 
 Ms. Hagan, a banking executive who became a full-time mother before she started her State Senate career in 1998, was not the party's first choice to oppose Mrs. Dole, who had served in the cabinets of two presidents and as president of the American Red Cross. Michael F. Easley, the outgoing governor, declined to run, as did former Gov. Jim Hunt and Representative Brad Miller of Raleigh. Even Ms. Hagan said at first that she would not enter the race, but changed her mind after a concerted effort to recruit her. She was co-chairwoman of the budget committee in the General Assembly and had served as a county chairwoman in Greensboro for Mr. Hunt's campaigns.
 Asked if promises of financial help induced her to run, Ms. Hagan sidestepped the question. ''There's not been a day since I decided to get in the race that I've regretted it,'' she said. ''I'm going to win this race.''
 One of Mrs. Dole's weak points is the lack of time she spent in the state in the first four years of her term. (She maintains a residence at the Watergate in Washington and owns a home in Salisbury, N.C., where she was born.) In a review of Senate records, news releases and news clippings, The Winston-Salem Journal recently found that Mrs. Dole spent only 13 days in the state in 2006. Dole campaign officials said that the records did not reflect trips paid for by the campaign or by Mrs. Dole personally, and that news organizations did not report on every visit to the state.
 Still, from 2004 to 2006, Mrs. Dole was busy raising money as the chairwoman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. In 2006, Republicans lost control of the Senate.
 ''Right now, we've had somebody in Congress that is an absentee -- she really doesn't leave Washington,'' Ms. Hagan said Monday in an interview after a campaign stop at a nursing home in Lexington, N.C.
 Ferrel Guillory, a political science professor at the University of North Carolina, said there was a sense in the state capital that Mrs. Dole had been disengaged, but, Mr. Guillory added, ''It's hard to know how much of this sinks in to the general public, the general voters.''
 It was difficult last week to find a voter who had given much thought to the Senate race. Asked if she was familiar with the candidates, Sharon Freeman, 28, who was shopping in Greenville for microphones for her church, said, ''I've seen the smears.'' But she said she had not yet made a decision.
 At the nursing home in Lexington, Mollie Mason, 79, said that she, too, was undecided. She was impressed that Ms. Hagan had visited the home, but, she said: ''Elizabeth Dole, she's our senator. I like her, I really do. To me, her promises seem true.''
 Analysts said it was unclear how the pitched presidential campaigns in the state would affect the Senate race. On North Carolina ballots, voters cannot vote a straight party ticket for the entire ballot. The presidential ticket must be chosen separately.
 ''The main effect the presidential race is likely to have is its influence on turnout,'' said David W. Rhode, a political science professor at Duke University.
 In the last year, the number of registered Democrats has increased by 9.7 percent, compared with 2.7 percent for Republicans. Democrats substantially outnumber Republicans, but the state leans Republican in federal races. 
 Ms. Hagan, who is 55, has tried to link her opponent to President Bush and attacked Mrs. Dole based on a ranking by the Web site Congress.org that rated her 93rd in effectiveness in the Senate, not so subtly trying to make Mrs. Dole's age an issue at the same time. One advertisement shows an old man in a rocking chair saying, ''I tell you, Liddy Dole is 93.'' (Mrs. Dole is 72.)
 Mrs. Dole's advertisements returned fire, showing a yapping dog leaping at a fence and saying, ''They call her fibber Kay Hagan,'' telling ''fib after fib'' as ''she tries to turn us against Elizabeth Dole.''
 But Ms. Hagan and her supporters had a head start -- they ran attack advertisements all summer, and political analysts said the Dole campaign had been slow to gear up its response.
 Mrs. Dole has been defending her record, playing up her efforts to help local law enforcement agencies enroll in a federal program to determine the immigration status of people in custody and her involvement in the federal tobacco crop buyout. 
 At Tuesday night's rally for Ms. Palin, which was the first public appearance by a member of the Republican presidential slate in North Carolina since the primaries, Mrs. Dole said she had been an early proponent of regulating Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the mortgage giants.
 ''This infuriates me,'' she said. ''They break something, and then they blame it on the Republicans, and next thing, it's a bumper sticker.''

HEADLINE: Mortgages, Health Care, Free Trade And Truth

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
Single-Payer Care
 Mr. McCain said: ''Senator Obama wants to set up health care bureaucracies, take over the health care of America through -- as he said, his object is a single-payer system. If you like that, you would love Canada and England.'' 
 Mr. McCain was wrong in saying that Mr. Obama's proposal called for a single-payer system. Mr. Obama wants private insurers to continue to operate, but would subject them to strict federal regulation, so, for example, they could not deny coverage to people in poor health.
 Under his proposal, Mr. Obama says, people who have private health insurance and like it could keep it. People without insurance could sign up for a ''new public plan,'' like the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, which covers federal employees, including members of Congress.
 Alternatively, under the Obama proposal, people could enroll in a private health plan offered through a national health insurance exchange, a sort of marketplace for health plans meeting federal standards.
 Mr. Obama would not eliminate or explicitly discourage private insurance plans. But some economists and insurance companies say it could be difficult for private insurers to compete effectively with the new public plan that Mr. Obama would make available to millions of uninsured Americans.

HEADLINE: Transactions In Decline, EBay Cuts Its Forecast

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
The slowdown in consumer spending has begun to flatten the growth at eBay, the online retailer, which said on Wednesday that continued weak spending would reduce revenue for the rest of the year. 
 For the first time, eBay's gross merchandise volume, the total sum of all transactions on the eBay Marketplace, declined. 
 It was the biggest disappointment in eBay's announcement of its third-quarter financial results. Volume, which analysts consider an important measure of growth for the company, fell 1 percent in its third quarter from the same period last year, to $14.28 billion. Volume had increased 8 percent in the second quarter, which also showed a big decline from the robust double-digit growth of earlier periods. 
 EBay, once primarily a marketplace for high-end unique merchandise sold in online auctions, has in recent months found itself increasingly vulnerable to consumers' cutting back on spending. It has started shifting to fixed-price sales, improving service and beefing up its other businesses. The company warned analysts Wednesday that its revenue for the year could be as low as $8.53 billion, well below its earlier forecast of $8.8 billion to $9.05 billion. For the fourth quarter, eBay expects revenue of $2.02 billion to $2.17 billion, compared with Wall Street's estimate of $2.43 billion.
 The company reported net income of $492.2 million, or 38 cents a share, compared with a loss of $935.6 million, or 69 cents a share for the same period last year because of eBay's acquisition of Skype, an online phone and messaging service. The company said revenue climbed 12 percent, to $2.12 billion, driven largely by growth in advertising and its PayPal payment services.
 ''We delivered strong results in a very challenging time,'' said John J. Donahoe, eBay's chief executive, in a conference call with securities analysts on Wednesday. ''These are turbulent times for which no one has a playbook.''
 ''It was not a clean quarter, to say the least,'' said Youssef Squali, an analyst with Jeffries & Sons. The biggest surprise, he said, was the first decline ever in gross merchandise volume, particularly outside the United States. ''That was the biggest red flag.''
 Shares in eBay fell more than 5 percent, to $14.46, in after-hours trading subsequent to the announcement, extending a 13.6 percent decline in regular trading hours on Wednesday. Shares of eBay have lost more than half their value since mid-April.
 Hoping to soften the impact of the report, eBay warned investors last week that it expected third-quarter revenue to fall below Wall Street expectations. 
 The company has said it will lay off 10 percent of its work force of 16,000, including 1,000 permanent employees, and pay a total of $1.35 billion to acquire the online payment firm Bill Me Later and two Danish classified advertising companies. 
 The company said that most of the layoffs would come in eBay's core marketplace division, where growth has slowed significantly.
 The marketplace unit, which includes Shopping.com and the ticket reseller StubHub in addition to eBay's core auction site, recorded 4 percent revenue growth -- more than half of that from outside the United States.
 Revenue in its PayPal unit increased 27 percent as total payments volume grew 28 percent. Revenue from Skype grew 46 percent as that business added 32 million new users during the quarter.

HEADLINE: Gates Seeks More Military and Civilian Support in Afghanistan

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Wednesday that the mission to stabilize Afghanistan had shown significant gaps in the ability of the United States and NATO to integrate their civilian and military efforts, and he warned that it ''remains to be seen'' whether the allies could better coordinate their work. 
 To be successful in Afghanistan, Mr. Gates said, the entire NATO alliance, the European Union and nongovernmental development organizations ''must better integrate and coordinate with one another and also with the Afghan government.''
 ''These efforts today -- however well intentioned and even heroic -- add up to less than the sum of the parts,'' Mr. Gates said. 
 The main objective of the NATO defense ministerial meeting last week was to take concrete steps ''to reverse that equation,'' Mr. Gates noted. He added, ''Whether we will make progress remains to be seen.''
 The defense secretary's grim assessment came in an evening address to the United States Institute of Peace in which he described the Afghanistan security and stabilization mission as ''the test, on the grandest scale, of what we are trying to achieve when it comes to integrating the military and civilian, the public and private, the national and international.''
 With overall violence and the number of American combat deaths rising in Afghanistan, the Bush administration has begun a review of its strategy in the military effort against insurgents and terrorists, as well as broader initiatives to improve governance and economic development and to battle the drug trade.
 Mr. Gates said the challenge of better integrating civilian and military missions was vital for more than just success in Afghanistan. ''The security of the American people will depend increasingly on our ability to head off the next insurgency or arrest the collapse of another failing state,'' he said. ''These are the things that we must be able to do as a nation, as an alliance and as an international coalition.''
 The address allowed Mr. Gates to return to what has been a repeated rebuke of NATO allies that send troops to Afghanistan, but limit the combat missions they may undertake. 
 ''In the case of Afghanistan, NATO's operations are hamstrung by national caveats, where different countries impose different rules on where their forces can go and what they can do,'' he said. Beyond that, Mr. Gates noted, many allies also ''have defense budgets that are so low, and coalition governments so precarious, that they cannot provide the quantity or type of forces needed for this kind of fight.''

HEADLINE: Presley, Palin and the Heartland

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: BRANSON, Mo. 

 BODY:
 I never imagined that a Republican mayor from Bible-belt Missouri would revive my faith in American democracy, but Raeanne Presley did just that.
 As a high-energy brunette running a small town, she's been ribbed since Sarah Palin became her party's nominee for vice president. ''Guess you'll be moving on to governor soon,'' she gets told. ''And up from there.''
 But Presley's not interested. She's Midwestern practical to Palin's rabble-rousing frontierswoman. Common sense interests her more than aw-shucks nonsense. She prefers balanced budgets to unbalanced attacks. 
 Presley -- no relation to Elvis -- runs the capital of the American heartland. Branson, population 7,500, is to country-western, country-first, evangelical culture what Haight-Ashbury once was to the hippie movement: its mother lode.
 You won't find gambling in wholesome Branson. Food gets deep-fried; Christmas gets celebrated from Nov, 1; churches get filled.
 On the gridlocked ''strip'' -- more theater seats than Broadway -- nobody blows their horn. The featured speaker at veterans' week in November will be Oliver North, the Reagan-era rogue of the Iran-contra scandal. He'll get a cheer: this area of southern Missouri voted about 70 percent Bush in 2004.
 What you do find on the strip are the 8 million tourists -- more than a thousand times the population -- who come here annually in search of religious, family and patriotic entertainment. Dream on, Wasilla.
 (If the Branson population-tourist ratio applied in New York, the city would get upward of 8 billion tourists a year. It gets around 46 million.)
 Entertainment includes country-western music, the ''Dixie Stampede'' rodeo show, old favorites like Andy Williams, Chinese acrobats, Irish tenors and a Veterans Memorial Museum. A Japanese violinist does country and Cajun.
 ''For skimpy costumes or harsh language,'' Presley, 50, said, ''you go to Vegas or New York. We've no rules against a racy show. You're welcome to give it a shot. But we hope you don't succeed.''
 One thing Branson does not have is foreign tourists. Head-shaking Europeans bewildered by ''the other America'' should check it out. The town, with its more than 50 theaters (Broadway has 39), would be an education.
 My own did not go according to plan. I came to Branson and its mayor with my liberal prejudices and was disarmed. Presley reminded me of my ex-mother-in-law, another brisk, pragmatic, funny, no-nonsense Republican Midwesterner with little tolerance for debt, delinquency, dumbness or dereliction of duty. She also reminded me of a great American virtue: getting on with it.
 And it dawned on me that Palin, with her vile near-accusations of treason against Barack Obama, her cloying doggone hymns to small-town U.S.A., her with-us-or-against-us refrain, is really an impostor.
 She's the representative of a kind of last-gasp Republicanism, of an exhausted party, whose proud fiscal conservatism and patriotism have given away to scurrilous fear-mongering and ideological confusion.
 It's a party in need of a break from power after the Bush years in order to re-learn what Presley represents: the can-do, down-to-earth, honest, industrious, spend-what-you-earn civility of the heartland. That civility has been usurped into Palin's trash talk.
 Presley's busy, in a tough economic climate, balancing a $61 million budget, trying to preserve jobs, getting a new $500 million convention center rolling, seeking a better balance between development and the environment.
 I asked her about the election. ''This is an exciting moment,'' she said. ''An African-American at the top of the Democratic ticket. As Americans we should be proud of that. A woman running for vice president. We can be proud of that, too.''
 I asked her if she was a closet liberal. She laughed.
 She said her oldest son, Nick, went to Stanford, and she expected him to come back from California ''with a tattoo and a piercing.'' But, no. He's now working at the family's Country Jubilee Theater.
 It was one of the first to open on the strip. I'm 53, and I reckon the night I saw the show I lowered the audience's average age to about 78. Fall is ''empty-nester'' season -- oceans of gray hair.
 The audience roared when a hillbilly idiot said something dumb and was rebuked by his father: ''Next thing, you'll believe in global warming!''
 So go the culture wars in Branson.
 This is red-state central, dear to evangelicals. But Presley has few illusions. Obama has been surging in bellwether Missouri with its long and almost perfect record of voting for the winner. He is now neck and neck with John McCain in the state polls.
 Americans still vote their pocketbooks -- always have, always will. 
 ''I can see how the drift is going, but we'll move on,'' the mayor said.
 A speech four years ago brought Obama to the national stage: ''There is not a liberal America and a conservative America. There is the United States of America. There is not a black America and a white America and Latino America and Asian America. There's the United States of America.''
 I found that spirit in Branson, the last place I expected. And it gave me hope, in these sobering days, for a nation aching to unite behind a new start and uplifting endeavor.

HEADLINE: Lively Exchanges on Policy and Character

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG; Michael Cooper contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Senator John McCain used the final debate of the presidential election on Wednesday night to raise persistent and pointed questions about Senator Barack Obama's character, judgment and policy prescriptions in a session that was by far the most spirited and combative of their encounters this fall.
At times showing anger and at others a methodical determination to make all his points, Mr. McCain pressed his Democratic rival on taxes, spending, the tone of the campaign and his association with the former Weather Underground leader William Ayers, using nearly every argument at his disposal in an effort to alter the course of a contest that has increasingly gone Mr. Obama's way.
But Mr. Obama maintained a placid and at times bemused demeanor -- if at times appearing to work at it -- as he parried the attacks and pressed his consistent line that Mr. McCain would represent a continuation of President Bush's unpopular policies, especially on the economy.
That set the backdrop for one of the sharpest exchanges of the evening, when, in response to Mr. Obama's statement that Mr. McCain had repeatedly supported Mr. Bush's economic policies, Mr. McCain fairly leaped out of his chair to say: ''Senator Obama, I am not President Bush. If you wanted to run against President Bush, you should have run four years ago.'' 
Acknowledging Mr. McCain had his differences with Mr. Bush, Mr. Obama replied, ''The fact of the matter is that if I occasionally mistake your policies for George Bush's policies, it's because on the core economic issues that matter to the American people -- on tax policy, on energy policy, on spending priorities -- you have been a vigorous supporter of President Bush.''
The debate touched on a wide variety of issues, including abortion, judicial appointments, trade and climate change as well as the economy, with the candidates often making clear the deep differences between them.
But it also put on display the two very different temperaments of the candidates with less than three weeks until Election Day. The lasting image of the night could be the split screen of Mr. Obama, doing his best to maintain his unflappable demeanor under a sometimes withering attack, and Mr. McCain looking coiled, occasionally breathing deeply, apparently in an expression of impatience.
Sitting side by side with only the host, Bob Schieffer of CBS News, between them on the stage at Hofstra University, Mr. McCain made clear from the start that he was going to follow the prescriptions of many of his supporters -- among them his running mate, Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska -- and try to put Mr. Obama on the defensive and shake him from his steady debate style.
Seizing on an encounter in Ohio this week with a voter -- Joe Wurzelbacher, a plumber -- who told Mr. Obama that he feared that his tax policies would punish him as a small-business owner, Mr. McCain pressed his attack on Mr. Obama as a tax-and-spend liberal. Mr. Obama's plan would raise taxes on filers earning more than $250,000 a year, a category that includes some small businesses, but would cut taxes on households earning less than $200,000 a year.
Seeking to suggest that Mr. Obama would hurt the economy and many entrepreneurs, Mr. McCain said, ''The whole premise behind Senator Obama's plans are class warfare -- let's spread the wealth around,'' repeating a phrase Mr. Obama had used to Mr. Wurzelbacher in explaining the rationale for his upper-income tax increase.
''Why would you want to do that -- anyone, anyone in America -- when we have such a tough time, when these small-business people like Joe the Plumber are going to create jobs unless you take that money from him and spread the wealth around,'' Mr. McCain said.
The plumber came up directly or indirectly 24 times during the debate, an Everyman symbol of the divide between the candidates on how best to address the economy.
As he has done in previous encounters, Mr. Obama looked into the camera and repeated his plan: ''Now, the conversation I had with Joe the Plumber, what I essentially said to him was, five years ago, when you weren't in the position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then. And what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who doesn't yet have money, I want to give them a tax break now.''
Coming on a day that the Dow Jones average had one of its worst drops in history, Mr. Schieffer tried something other moderators had failed to do this fall: get the two candidates to enumerate which proposals they would specifically have to postpone or cut in the face of an economic environment that has changed drastically since they first drew up their plans.
Neither man went very far, though Mr. McCain perhaps offered a more detailed list. Repeating his pledge of an across-the-board spending cut, he said, ''Well, one of them would be the marketing assistance program. Another one would be a number of subsidies for ethanol.''
Mr. Obama, for his part, specifically cited the ''$15 billion a year on subsidies to insurance companies,'' a component of the Medicare program. But, he said more generally, ''we need to eliminate a whole host of programs that don't work, and I want to go through the federal budget line by line, page by page. Programs that don't work, we should cut.''
Still, though the winner of this election will inherit the most sweeping federal intervention in financial markets in at least three generations, the debate, while not short of policy discussions, was at least as much about the styles of the two men as they engaged one another.
In the days before the debate, Mr. Obama had appeared to have goaded Mr. McCain, saying in an interview with ABC News that he did not know why Mr. McCain had not personally made an issue of Mr. Obama's association with Mr. Ayers, with whom he worked with on two nonprofit boards, in their last debate considering that Mr. McCain's campaign had done so repeatedly in recent weeks.
And there was some degree of anticipation over whether Mr. McCain would do so this time. He did, though only after a bit of prompting from Mr. Schieffer, who, in a question about the tone of the campaign directed at both men, asked Mr. McCain specifically, ''Your running mate said he palled around with terrorists.''
Mr. McCain initially did not address that point directly.
But as Mr. Schieffer seemed prepared to move to another topic, Mr. McCain returned to Mr. Ayers on his own. Mr. McCain seemed most agitated in that moment, saying: ''I don't care about an old, washed-up terrorist. But as Senator Clinton said in her debates with you, we need to know the full extent of that relationship. We need to know the full extent of Senator Obama's relationship with Acorn, who is now on the verge of maybe perpetrating one of the greatest frauds in voter history in this country, maybe destroying the fabric of democracy.''
He was referring to a community activist group that focuses on housing issues and has been running voter registration efforts in many states that have drawn accusations of fraud.
Mr. Obama's aides said during the day that he was preparing for the Ayers question.
''Bill Ayers is a professor of education in Chicago. Forty years ago, when I was 8 years old, he engaged in despicable acts with a radical domestic group. I have roundly condemned those acts,'' Mr. Obama said. ''Ten years ago, he served and I served on a board that was funded by one of Ronald Reagan's former ambassadors and close friends, Mr. Annenberg.''
On Acorn, Mr. Obama said, ''Apparently what they have done is they were paying people to go out and register folks. And apparently some of the people who were out there didn't really register people, they just filled out a bunch of names. Had nothing to do with us. We were not involved.''
Speaking of his involvement with the group, he said, ''The only involvement I've had with Acorn was I represented them alongside the U.S. Justice Department in making Illinois implement a motor voter law that helped people register at D.M.V.'s.'' Mr. Obama's campaign made some payments to an affiliate of Acorn.
Mr. Obama said sternly as Mr. McCain bristled, ''And I think the fact that this has become such an important part of your campaign, Senator McCain, says more about your campaign than it says about me.''

HEADLINE: Bush Calls Bank Intervention Temporary

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. 

 BODY:
President Bush came here on Wednesday to explain and defend his program to resuscitate the nation's economy, and he said any long-lasting federal intervention in the banking industry would be a mistake. 
 Mr. Bush had lunch with local bankers and business people at a small restaurant in Ada, Mich., just outside Grand Rapids. 
 A longtime champion of free-market principles, Mr. Bush looked uncomfortable as he defended the huge sudden expansion in the role of the federal government, which is buying up to $250 billion of bank stock in an effort to encourage new lending. The exercise of federal power, he suggested, was virtually forced on him by the crisis on Wall Street and the threat it posed to creditworthy consumers and businesses across the country.
 ''I frankly don't want the government being involved with businesses, owning businesses -- it's not -- I don't think it's good for the country,'' Mr. Bush told reporters gathered in a small parking lot behind the restaurant. ''It was necessary that the stock be purchased to help us through this financial crisis, but in the long run it's not good for the country.''
 The whole purpose, he said, is ''to restore confidence in our financial system'' and thus to get the ''economy back on its feet again.''
 Before leaving Washington on Wednesday, Mr. Bush met with his cabinet at the White House to discuss the financial rescue plan.
 ''It's very important for the American people to know that the program is designed to preserve free enterprise, not replace free enterprise,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Decisions we took to enhance liquidity and make sure our financial instruments are strong is a temporary decision.''
 Defending the actions of his administration, Mr. Bush said, ''We have taken extraordinary measures because these are extraordinary circumstances.''
 Grand Rapids, once the home of President Gerald R. Ford, has been a Republican stronghold. But the nation's economic troubles have taken a toll here, as in the rest of the state.
 On Monday, General Motors announced plans to close a local metal-stamping plant that makes doors, fenders, hoods and other auto parts. The factory, opened more than 70 years ago, is to close by the end of 2009. The automaker cited slumping sales of trucks and sport utility vehicles as a reason for its decision, which came as a shock to more than 1,300 workers.
 After lunch on Wednesday, Mr. Bush went to a fund-raiser at the estate of Dick DeVos, a former chief executive of Amway, the consumer goods distribution company.
 Even though Mr. Bush's approval ratings are low, Republicans said, he was able to raise tens of thousands of dollars for Republican House members facing serious challenges in their bids for re-election. 
 Mr. Bush was in Michigan less than four hours. But he said, ''It's good to be out of Washington, out here with people who are taking risk and working hard.''

HEADLINE: Excerpts From the Debate

 BODY:
Excerpts from the presidential debate on Wednesday night in Hempstead, N.Y., between Senator John McCain and Senator Barack Obama, as recorded by Federal News Service. The moderator was Bob Schieffer of CBS News. A full transcript and video: nytimes.com/politics. 
 MR. MCCAIN A couple of days ago Senator Obama was out in Ohio, and he had an encounter with a guy who's a plumber. Name is Joe Wurzelbacher. Joe wants to buy the business that he's been in for all these years. Worked 10, 12 hours a day. And he wanted to buy the business, but he looked at your tax plan and he saw that he was going to pay much higher taxes. You were going to put him in a higher tax bracket, which was going to increase his taxes, which was going to cause him not to be able to employ people. Joe was trying to realize the American dream.
 Now, Senator Obama talks about the very, very rich. Joe, I want to tell you, I'll not only help you buy that business that you worked your whole life for, and I'll keep your taxes low, and I'll provide available and affordable health care for you and your employees. 
 And I will not have, I will not stand for, a tax increase on small-business income. ... 
 MR. OBAMA I think tax policy is a major difference between Senator McCain and myself. And we both want to cut taxes. The difference is who we want to cut taxes for.
 Now, Senator McCain -- the centerpiece of his economic proposal is to provide $200 billion in additional tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in America. ExxonMobil and other oil companies, for example, would get an additional $4 billion in tax breaks.
 What I have said is, I want to provide a tax cut for 95 percent of working Americans, 95 percent. If you make less than a quarter-million dollars a year, then you will not see your income tax go up, your capital gains tax go up, your payroll tax. Not one dime. ...
 Now, the conversation I had with Joe the Plumber, what I essentially said to him was, five years ago, when you were in the position to buy your business, you needed a tax cut then. And what I want to do is to make sure that the plumber, the nurse, the firefighter, the teacher, the young entrepreneur who doesn't yet have money, I want to give them a tax break now.

HEADLINE: OIL PRICE DROPS, AIDING ECONOMY AND CONSUMERS

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
Oil prices dropped below $70 a barrel for the first time in 14 months Thursday, prompting the OPEC cartel to call for an emergency meeting next week to establish some stability in prices that have plummeted recently after rising for months. 
 Oil prices have tumbled by nearly $40 a barrel in just three weeks as indications grow that demand for energy will slow along with weakening economies around the world. As recently as July, oil was trading at a record of $145 a barrel.
 The decline in oil prices could provide a form of stimulus to the economy as consumers pay less to fill up their tanks. If oil prices stay at current levels, consumers would have $250 billion more, over a year, to save or spend elsewhere, according to Lawrence Goldstein, an energy economist. Some analysts expect oil prices to keep declining, perhaps to as low as $50 a barrel in coming months. 
 Americans will probably see lower energy bills this winter, as gasoline and heating oil futures also dropped sharply on Thursday. Gasoline prices now average $3.08 a gallon, down from a summer peak of $4.11 a gallon, according to AAA. 
 The decline in oil prices came after a government report showed domestic crude oil stockpiles rose more than expected as Americans use less oil, in part because they are driving less. In the last month, domestic oil demand has fallen to its lowest level since June 1999, at 18.6 million barrels a day, according to the Energy Department.
 Oil settled down $4.69 a barrel, at $69.85. The drop, along with other promising signs on the inflation front, was among the reasons investors bid stocks higher, with the Dow Jones industrial average closing up 401.35 points at 8,979.26. 
 Natural gas prices have also tumbled since their summer peak of $13.58 per thousand cubic feet. On Thursday, natural gas futures rose 19 cents, to $6.81, after a report showed that stockpiles rose less than expected.
 While consumers may have reason to cheer the falling oil prices after such a sharp run-up, the wild roller coaster of volatility is a nightmare for oil producers and petroleum executives who say they need more stability to plan long-term projects to develop new sources of oil. 
 If they cannot be confident that they will get a stable return on their investment, they may hold back. That in turn could set the stage for possible shortages of oil and higher prices when global demand picks up again.
 The sharp drop-off has forced OPEC's hand. The cartel said just last week that it would meet in mid-November, after the United States elections. But on Thursday, it rescheduled its emergency session for next Friday, Oct. 24. 
 The cartel's producers, which control 40 percent of global exports, could curb their output by about a million barrels a day to try to stem the drop in prices, according to analysts. 
 It is unclear what price range for oil the cartel wants to establish. But the meeting ''sends a clear signal that OPEC is concerned about the speed with which oil prices are slipping away from a preferred price of around $80 a barrel,'' said Lawrence Eagles, an oil analyst at JPMorgan. 
 Iran's oil minister, Gholamhossein Nozari, told reporters in Tehran on Tuesday, ''I think the low price is a real damage to the future of production.'' 
 From its inception, the oil industry has gone through countless cycles, with oil companies cutting investments when prices fell. The price collapse of the 1980s forced companies to slash investments and prompted a wave of large mergers through the industry. But this retrenchment left the world scrambling for oil when demand from Asian and Latin American economies soared. 
 Concerns that this pattern might be repeated were mentioned frequently during an industry conference in Venice last weekend, where oil executives said they worried that a prolonged recession, tighter credit and lower energy consumption would mean slower growth in energy supplies in coming years. 
 The credit freeze has already forced some projects to be scaled back, some energy analysts and executives said. ''This is a real test,'' said Jeroen van der Veer, the chief executive of Royal Dutch Shell, in an interview at the conference. ''Some people will be overstretched, and there will be some delays in some projects.''
 Over the last decade, growth in oil consumption has outpaced the ability of producers to meet that demand with more production. Many experts have predicted a new squeeze within the next five years that could once again propel oil prices over $100 a barrel. 
 The drop in prices has already created problems for oil producers. Iran and Venezuela both need oil prices at $95 a barrel to balance their national budgets, Russia needs $70 and Saudi Arabia needs $55 a barrel, according to Deutsche Bank estimates. Algeria's oil minister, Chakib Khelil, said on Thursday that the ''ideal'' price for crude oil was $70 to $90 a barrel.
 In Russia, which is not part of OPEC, the drop in prices is threatening the country's ability to increase production. The Russian government has reportedly agreed to allocate $9 billion to its four major producers -- Lukoil, Gazprom, Rosneft and TNK-BP -- to help them cope with investment needs amid the credit crisis. 
 In the United States, Chesapeake Energy, a gas producer, has recently indicated it will reduce its capital investments over the next few years in response to falling prices.
 Global oil demand is undeniably slowing down, particularly in developed nations. Japanese oil consumption tumbled by 12 percent in August over the same month a year ago, while in the United States, demand fell by 8 percent in September. 
 Consumption is still growing in developing nations, but at a slower pace than in recent years. The International Energy Agency expects global oil demand to grow by just 400,000 barrels a day this year, to 86.5 million barrels a day. The agency, which had been revising downward its predictions all year, forecast growth of 2 million barrels a day for 2008 when the year started. 
 The two-day energy meetings last week were held in private in the baroque setting of the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, home to a 10th-century Benedictine monastery. In many conversations with senior executives outside of the conference meetings, they voiced concerns about their industry becoming increasingly vulnerable to a slowing economy. 
 ''We pretty much know where supplies are going to come from in future years, but today the biggest uncertainty is demand,'' said Christophe de Margerie, chief executive of Total, the French oil company. 
 Some executives, though, are still holding out hope that Asian economies may weather the economic storm and help the global economy recover faster. Lower oil prices could also make it harder for some companies to survive on their own, leading to a new wave of mergers and acquisitions. 
 ''This new environment is not all doom and gloom,'' said Mr. van der Veer, of Shell. ''It can also provide some opportunities. Certain assets may become available.''

 ASIA SOCIETY AND MUSEUM: 'ART AND CHINA'S REVOLUTION,' through Jan. 11. The splashy party that was the 2008 Olympics is yesterday's news, but one-party rule in China remains. New China is still, in significant ways, Old China. The obvious question is: What comes next? To help answer it, Asia Society asks a different, equally timely post-Olympics question: What came before? This exhibition of paintings, drawings, posters and Maoist souvenirs produced in the years leading up to and during the Cultural Revolution gives complicated answers. It lays out the conflicted loyalties that have shaped contemporary China, and finds them in the work of artists who anticipated the current art boom and are part of it. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 288-6400, asiasociety.org. 
 (Holland Cotter) 
 * ASIA SOCIETY AND MUSEUM: 'TRACES OF THE CALLIGRAPHER: ISLAMIC CALLIGRAPHY IN PRACTICE, CIRCA 1600-1900' AND 'WRITING THE WORD OF GOD: CALLIGRAPHY AND THE QUR'AN,' through Feb. 8. These side-by-side exhibitions, perfect in size and carefully thought out, approach Islamic calligraphy from two perspectives. The first show is basically a manual in techniques of fine penmanship and luxury book-making, illustrated by superb examples of tools of the trade and finished products. The second is an array of hand-written Koran pages for total-immersion contemplation. Gorgeous.(See above.)
 (Cotter)
 BRONX MUSEUM OF THE ARTS: 'STREET ART STREET LIFE: FROM THE 1950S TO NOW,' through Jan. 25. If to you ''street life'' means noise-lights-action, you'll find this show a surprise. With its immaculate, stripped-down installation, the exhibition is clearly devoted not to recreating the feel of art on the street, but to recording it, from Robert Frank's unvarnished photographic views of post-World War II America to digital montages by Fatimah Tuggar uniting today's streets of New York and Lagos, Nigeria. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. 
 (Cotter)
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'GILBERT & GEORGE,' through Jan. 11. Dynamic duo, gruesome twosome or just plain geeks in ties and tweeds, the British artists Gilbert & George don't seem to care what you call them as long as you pay attention, which you couldn't avoid doing if you tried in their suffocating and disordered wraparound survey at the Brooklyn Museum. In no particular sequence, we see the shadowy early black-and-white photographic pieces they did while living in a falling-down section of London in the 1970s, and the huge Pop colored murals filled with flowers and crowds of dishy young men, which decrease in number during the most devastating years of the AIDS epidemic. The newest work in the show, from 2005 and 2006, is crazy, end-of-time stuff. Terrorism and religious fundamentalism are the themes, and Gilbert and George themselves, partners in art as in life, are in the picture, mugging, moralizing, unembarrassed and all but unendurable, in art that's right for right now. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
 BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'JESPER JUST: ROMANTIC DELUSIONS,' through Jan. 4. An enchanting show of four short films exhibits most of the qualities for which Mr. Just has become known since completing his studies at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 2003. Melodramatic but never campy or over the top and made with Hollywood-quality production values, his brief musicals explore vulnerable, ordinarily well-armored zones of the masculine psyche, like grief, same-sex love, Oedipal conflict and spiritual desire. The singing is wonderful. (See above.) 
 (Ken Johnson)
 COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'HOUSE PROUD: 19-CENTURY WATERCOLOR INTERIORS FROM THE THAW COLLECTION,' through Jan. 25. The 70 or so jewel-like renderings of rooms and their furnishings here are delightful, mordantly signifying artifacts. They track the domestic effects of exoticism and nostalgia (chinoiserie, Gothic Revival); uncover glimmers of modernity (Biedermeier, smaller rooms); and witness the birth of the contemporary genre known as shelter porn. Accompanied by relevant examples of furniture, decorative objects and books, they also reveal that rooms seen whole, with light and space as well as decor carefully depicted, are among painting's most appealing subjects. 2 East 91st Street, (212) 849-8400, cooperhewitt.org. (Roberta Smith)
 GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'CATHERINE OPIE: AMERICAN PHOTOGRAPHER,' through Jan. 7. Catherine Opie is many artists in one. Best known in the 1990s for her striking portraits of gay, lesbian and transgendered men and women drawn from a circle of friends and intimates, she is also a photographer of landscapes, cityscapes, architecture, still lifes and lifestyles. She is an insider and an outsider: a documentarian and a provocateur, a classicist and a maverick; a trekker and a stay-at-home; a lesbian feminist mother who resists the gay mainstream. It's all here in a fine retrospective. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. 
 (Cotter) 
 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'AMERICA AND THE TINTYPE,' through Jan. 4. This show about the tintype, an early form of photograph made by exposing a lacquered iron plate to light, includes some 200 examples from the museum's collection. Most of the artists, and subjects, are unidentified. These works form a group portrait of Americans, mostly working- and middle-class, struggling to adapt to the rapidly shifting social and economic conditions during the four decades after the Civil War. The exhibition makes the most of the tintype's range of subject matter and emotion, from postmortem shots to vaudevillian caricatures, freedmen to minstrels. It does not dispute the daguerreotype's superior potentials for artistry but simply asserts that tintypes have been unfairly overlooked because of their ubiquity, affordability and anonymity. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org.

 INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'SUSAN MEISELAS: IN HISTORY,' through Jan. 4. A certain moral quandary runs throughout this fascinatingly problematic exhibition: how do you reconcile the demands of professionalism and those of human compassion? To her credit, Ms. Meiselas -- whose coverage of the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua in 1978-79 made her one of the world's most celebrated and criticized war correspondents -- does not duck the question. Tension between opportunism and conscience emerges as the show's main interest -- to the point that it trumps its ostensible subjects, which include strippers in traveling carnivals and forensic investigations of Saddam Hussein's campaign against the Kurds in northern Iraq.

 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE ESSENTIAL ART OF AFRICAN TEXTILES,' through March 22. This show presents 19th-century African textiles, many lent by the British Museum, alongside relevant contemporary artworks from the Met's collection. One of the most spectacular pairings matches El Anatsui's ''Between Earth and Heaven,'' a recent acquisition, with a kente prestige cloth from Ghana. The Met's 2005 exhibition ''Matisse: The Fabric of Dreams'' hinted that textiles had been undervalued in the Western canon; while the current show may not have the same blockbuster appeal, it goes deeper into the techniques and traditions that make the fabrics so striking and seductive. A related show, ''The Poetics of Cloth: African Textiles/Recent Art,'' is at the Grey Art Gallery at New York University. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'EARLY BUDDHIST MANUSCRIPT PAINTING: THE PALM-LEAF TRADITION,' through March 22. Practical features like resilience and portability help explain why books written on dried palm leaves were popular with Buddhists in eastern India between the 10th and 13th centuries. But another factor, surely, was the quality of the illustrations that accompanied the texts: exquisite figures of divinities or scenes from the Buddha's life. And few of these are as finely done and pristinely preserved as the examples in this small selection. (See above.) (Holland Cotter)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'GIORGIO MORANDI, 1890-1964,' through Dec. 14. Aspirants to the role of painter as poet are many. Giorgio Morandi (1890-1964) was the real thing. And this Morandi retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum of Art is something that anyone who loves painting and its very specific poetry will want to see. Morandi's still lifes are beautiful, but with a distinctive kind of beauty. And despite their small size and plain components -- bottles, jars, boxes, pots, seashells, vases -- they are emotionally audacious. This isn't because of what they say outright, but because of what they don't say; because they are so evidently shaped by self-restraint, and the passions that produced it. (See above.) (Holland Cotter)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'JEFF KOONS ON THE ROOF,' through Oct. 26. Panoramic views of Central Park and the Manhattan skyline from the Cantor Roof Garden are distracting, but the three sculptures now on display there are well worth visiting. Each is a greatly enlarged, glossily lacquered, stainless-steel representation of something small: a toy dog made of twisted-together balloons; a Valentine heart wrapped in red foil; and the silhouette of Piglet from a Winnie the Pooh coloring book randomly colored, as if by a young child. (See above.) (Johnson)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'LANDSCAPES CLEAR AND RADIANT: THE ART OF WANG HUI (1632-1717),' through Jan. 4. The Met's first solo show devoted to a Chinese master is gorgeous and revelatory; its focus is the landscape virtuoso Wang Hui, star of the 17th-century Chinese art scene. Wang could do anything and did, synthesizing and transforming disparate strands of almost a millennium of Chinese painting, but also making exact copies of earlier masterpieces. Distinguished by a Mozart-like ease and perfection, his work unsettles Western notions of copy, original and originality. It is aided in this by displays of works by 16 earlier artists dating to the 10th-century -- his mentors, his mentors' mentors and the artists they all revered -- which form a dazzling introduction to Chinese painting in general.(See above.) (Smith)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'RHYTHMS OF MODERN LIFE: BRITISH PRINTS 1914-1939,' through Dec. 7. This interesting but confusingly organized exhibition considers the impact of modernity and machine-age idealism on 13 progressive British printmakers. Much of the show is given over to a group of artists active in the 1920s and '30s -- including Claude Flight, Cyril E. Power and Sybil Andrews -- who created colorful linocuts in a lively synthesis of Cubism, Futurism and Art Deco. (See above.) (Johnson)
 MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'SECOND LIVES: REMIXING THE ORDINARY,' through Feb. 15. The inaugural show in the Museum of Arts and Design's jewel-box-like building continues its haphazard segue from a concentration on craft to a hipper, more wide-ranging program. Unfortunately, the focus is a strategy that is epidemic in the larger art world: the massing of something small (plastic spoons, ladies pumps, spools of thread, dangling eyeglasses) into something large (a pyramid, a loveseat, a view of the ''Mona Lisa,'' a chandelier). It is Surrealism 101, descended from Meret Oppenheim's beloved and far too influential fur-lined teacup. Basically, you see the thing. You see the things it is made of. Something in the way of a punch line follows. 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org.

 MUSEUM OF THE CITY OF NEW YORK: 'PARIS/NEW YORK: DESIGN FASHION CULTURE, 1925-1940,' through Feb. 22. This compact yet kaleidoscopic exhibition celebrates the romance that flourished between New York and Paris in the 1920s and '30s, when French Art Deco was the style, American jazz was the music, and skyscrapers and sumptuous ocean liners were among the symbols of the age. Selected and installed to extract maximum wattage from every juxtaposition, object and image (including many surprisingly effective digital reproductions), it tracks the exchange of goods as much as of ideas, and the roles played by both department stores and museums, knock-offs and originals, businessmen (especially developers) and designers and artists. Most memorably, it clarifies a golden age of design and building, when New York became the world capital of Art Deco architecture. 1220 Fifth Avenue, at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Smith) 
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'KIRCHNER AND THE BERLIN STREET,' through Nov. 10. Focusing on seven paintings produced between 1913 and 1915 by the German Expressionist Ernst Ludwig Kirchner (1880-1938), this exhibition delivers a terrific visual wallop at the start and then continues to reverberate. Vigorously realized in jagged brush strokes of lurid pinks, greens and yellows and shades of charcoal black, the paintings depict stylishly dressed female streetwalkers and furtive, darkly cloaked men on the nocturnal, vertiginously tilted streets of an infernal city on the brink of a world-destroying war. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. 
 (Johnson)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'LOOKING AT MUSIC,' through Jan. 5. This exhibition of about 40 works from the museum's collection emphasizes the experimental nature of both art and music in the late 1960s and early '70s. The lines dividing art, music and film were blurry enough to allow Laurie Anderson, Bruce Nauman and Yoko Ono, among others, to shift from object making to performance and back again. The show, which includes audio recordings and small-press publications alongside more conventional mediums, is accompanied by an extensive film and video program. (See above.) 
 (Rosenberg)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'NEW PHOTOGRAPHY 2008: JOSEPHINE MECKSEPER AND MIKHAEL SUBOTZKY,' through Jan. 5. Josephine Meckseper, a German-born artist in her 40s who was trained at the California Institute of the Arts, makes sleek-looking installations that mix photography and film -- often scenes of political protest -- with consumer objects. The South African artist Mikhael Subotzky, who at 26 is the youngest photographer to have been invited to join the Magnum Group, explores his country's prison system in vivid color and unflinching detail. If Ms. Meckseper finds glossy, consumerist fantasy infiltrating our political consciousness, Mr. Subotzky reminds us that some people don't yet have the luxury of fretting about the commodification of dissent. (See above.) 
 (Rosenberg) MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PIPE, GLASS, BOTTLE OF RUM: THE ART OF APPROPRIATION,' through Nov. 10. More than 100 works, mostly from the museum's drawing collection, represent many different ways of importing nontraditional images, materials, forms and techniques into the realm of art. The exhibition ranges from early Cubist collages by Picasso, Braques and Gris that have newsprint and faux-wood grain paper in them to the suave, agit-prop montages of Barbara Kruger printed on matchbooks and a shopping bag. Other artists include John Baldessari, Hannah Hoch, Sigmar Polke, Sherrie Levine and Richard Prince. (See above.) (Johnson)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'VAN GOGH AND THE COLORS OF THE NIGHT,' through Jan. 5. This small, anomalous exhibition is a Van Gogh antiblockbuster with a seemingly counterintuitive theme, given the importance of the brilliant light of southern France to his art. It explores Van Gogh's special relationship with darkness, where his interests in perception, color and symbolism fuse with unexpected intensity. And seeing a manageable number of Van Goghs -- including masterpieces like ''The Potato Eaters,'' ''The Starry Night'' and ''Night Cafe'' -- in intimate galleries is thrilling. (See above.) ( Smith)
 MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'WUNDERKAMMER: A CENTURY OF CURIOSITIES,' through Nov. 10. This exhibition of mostly prints and illustrated books gives too much space to artists in the Modern's pantheon or to predictable midmarket bench warmers. But it is inspired by a very un-Modern idea: the Renaissance wunderkammer, or cabinet of curiosities, a free-form collection of all things rare and marvelous, natural and man-made. Sensitively installed and rife with images of living, often grotesque creatures, it has the buzz of an aberrant ark and enough fresh material to sustain interest. The addition of a few objects from the museum's design collection is especially smart and effective; ignoring MoMA's departmental divisions is a good thing. (See above.) (Smith)
 NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: 'GEORGE TOOKER: A RETROSPECTIVE,' through Jan. 4. George Tooker has painted some of the 20th century's most memorable images of angst. With its lost souls haunting the New York underground, ''Subway'' (1950) envisions modernity as a spiritual prison system. The Kafkaesque ''Government Bureau'' (1956) pictures an office of seemingly infinite dimensions, where people wait like penitents at the windows of terminally unresponsive bureaucrats. Both paintings are included in this richly affecting five-decade career retrospective. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Johnson)
 NEW MUSEUM: 'LIVE FOREVER: ELIZABETH PEYTON,' through Jan. 11. This lush midcareer survey pays tribute to an artist whose diminutive, irony-free, boldly colored portraits of friends, artists, rock stars and other historic figures, living and dead, have exerted considerable influence over the last 16 years. The reason is a complex, highly effective fusion of the painterly, the personal and the Conceptual, as well as a kind of reverse appropriation, wherein photographs and snapshots are given a new permanence, substance and most of all feeling by being re-engineered into unique art objects. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)
 SCHOMBURG CENTER FOR RESEARCH IN BLACK CULTURE: 'AARON DOUGLAS: AFRICAN-AMERICAN MODERNIST,' through Nov. 30. In 1920s New York a great flowering of black culture emerged that came to be known as the Harlem Renaissance. No visual artist expressed that movement's euphoric sense of possibility with greater verve than the subject of this valuable exhibition, the painter, illustrator and muralist Aaron Douglas. His major works feature semitransparent silhouettes of black people in heroic poses overlaid by concentric, circular bands of light. Rendered in muted, luminous colors, they project visionary romanticism in a suave, Art Deco-like style. 515 Malcolm X Boulevard, at 135th Street, Harlem, (212) 491-2200, nypl.org/research/sc. 
 (Johnson)
 THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'NEW INTUITIONS: LESLIE HEWITT, TANEA RICHARDSON AND SAYA WOOLFALK,' through Oct. 26. The contrasting artistic sensibilities of the latest participants in the Studio Museum's artists-in-residence program maintain its impressive record. Leslie Hewitt, the most accomplished, extends the image-text combination of Conceptual Art in photographs and sculpture. Tanea Richardson, less mature but in some ways more complete, gives found fabrics and abstract form a special vehemence. Saya Woolfalk, a whiz in several mediums (starting with sewing), contributes a video, ''Ethnography of No Place,'' that drags a bit, but is a tour de force of performance, animation, born-again Pattern and Decoration, soft sculpture and anthropological satire. In each case race and ethnicity are among many other issues tackled. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Smith)THE STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'KEHINDE WILEY, THE WORLD STAGE: AFRICA, LAGOS-DAKAR,' through Oct. 26. In 10 recent works Kehinde Wiley shifts the focus of his big, flashy pictures of young African-American men recast as the kings, dandies, and saints of European painting to young African men in the poses of African sculpture. The show reveals a young artist who, despite several years of hotness, is only now beginning to make paintings that don't feel mostly like campy, gaudy illustrations. The compositions are calmer, the details less fussy, and the figures are painted with a new solidity and emotional directness.144 West 125th Street, (See above.) (Smith)

 SIMON LINKE Twenty years ago this London artist made a name for himself with his hand-painted copies of Artforum magazine ads. With the small, square paintings in this exhibition he has resumed that project. Almost all represent ads for famous artists, including Andy Warhol, Chris Ofili and Damien Hirst. Made with thick, buttery paint, they prompt meditation on the sacred and profane values of art. Mireille Mosler Ltd., 35 East 67th Street, (212) 249-4195, mireillemoslerltd.com, through Oct. 25. (Johnson)
 LIZA LOU It's no coincidence that Liza Lou's first New York appearance since a 2002 solo in SoHo takes place in an uptown town house and a Park Avenue lobby. Ms. Lou, a sculptor who makes hand-beaded versions of everyday objects and environments, has shifted from immersive installations (like the ''Kitchen'' and ''Back Yard'' exhibited at the New Museum in the mid-'90s) to highly marketable sculptures and relief paintings. The transition isn't all bad. Ms. Lou's beadwork is still dazzling, and she is certainly experimenting with different genres. The showstopper is ''Security Fence'' (2005-7), a shimmering 10-foot-square enclosure of barbed wire and chain-link steel completely covered with silver beads. (A similar sculpture, ''Maximum Security Fence,'' is on view in the lobby of Lever House, 390 Park Avenue, at 54th Street, through Nov. 29.) L & M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020, lmgallery.com; through Nov. 15 (Rosenberg).

 JOHN ALTOON Mr. Altoon (1925-1969), who made his name in the Los Angeles art scene of the 1950s and '60s and suffered a fatal heart attack shortly thereafter, is the latest West Coast artist to be exhumed by the contemporary market. In this exhibition of paintings and works on paper, organized by Klaus Kertess, Mr. Altoon's well-chronicled personal demons -- thrill seeking, womanizing, depression, paranoia -- are on full display. His drawings, in ink, watercolor, graphite and pastel on board, show men, women and animals engaged in explicitly violent and sexual interactions. Mary Boone, 745 Fifth Avenue, (212) 752-2929, maryboonegallery.com, through Oct. 25. (Rosenberg)

 RIRKRIT TIRAVANIJA: 'DEMONSTRATION DRAWINGS' This ambitious conceptual show by Rirkrit Tiravanija is made up of some 200 small, highly detailed graphite drawings of political protests and demonstrations from around the world. Most of the images were derived from newspaper photographs and have the on-the-spot look of reportage. All were done by artists in Thailand working on generous commissions from Mr. Tiravanija, with proceeds from the sale of the pictures going to the Land Foundation, a sustainable housing community in Thailand. The results in the show: drawing, the sine qua non of ''real'' art, meets the real world, and paradoxes unroll. The Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org, through Nov. 6. (Cotter)
 Galleries: Chelsea
 JOSEF KOUDELKA: 'INVASION 68, PRAGUE' During a few days in August 1968, Josef Koudelka had his first experience as a street photographer, taking pictures inside history as it unfolded. He gave a firsthand account of life, death and resistance on the streets of Prague, as the mostly Soviet tanks of the Warsaw Pact crushed the lenient Communist government led by Alexander Dubcek. Although a few negatives were smuggled to the West immediately after the occupation, this throat-catching show is the largest yet devoted to them. Aperture Gallery, 547 West 27th Street, (212) 505-5555, aperture.org, through Oct. 30. (Smith)
 DANIEL MCDONALD Daniel McDonald has been so important a part of the New York art scene since he arrived from California in 1989 that it's hard to believe that ''Bohemian Monsters'' is his first local solo show. This group of painstakingly made miniature environments, detailing the struggles of impoverished artists played by yesterday's B-movie horror film heroes, has been worth the wait. Broadway 1602, 1182 Broadway, at 28th Street, Apartment 1602 , (212) 481-0362, through Oct. 25. (Cotter)
 JEFF WHETSTONE: 'POST-PLEISTOCENE' The human urge to leave a mark has developed extensively, but caves -- the first canvases -- have never been left behind. Proof positive are 10 large, haunting color photographs in this engrossing New York debut. They record the accumulated drawings, signatures, messages and graffiti in caves in Tennessee and Alabama. The tools range from rocks and charcoal (such as the original cave painters used) to fluorescent spray paint; the mark makers range from slaves to contemporary teen-agers. The result is an inadvertent cultural cross-section that is sometimes beautiful and always eerie. Julie Saul Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 627-2410, saulgallery.com, through Oct. 25. (Smith)
 SUE WILLIAMS: 'PROJECT FOR THE NEW AMERICAN CENTURY' In this bifurcated show the artist starts to recapture the energy and fury of the crudely painted, scathingly feminist cartoon paintings that established her reputation in the first place in a series of small, messy, politically motivated works on acetate. The larger and more expensive items have a new level of visual nastiness, but they are also more drawn than painted -- in fact, their mechanical, textilelike exquisiteness is exactly the problem that the smaller efforts avoid. David Zwirner, 525 West 19th Street, (212) 727-2070, through Oct. 25. (Smith)

 'ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM: A WORLD ELSEWHERE' A gallery chain based in London and owned by an auction house opens in New York in an overdone, chopped-up space with a shapeless, absurdly unnecessary exhibition of paintings and sculptures by those mythic market stalwarts, the leaders of the New York School. Under crowded (auction-house-like) conditions await exceptional works by Clyfford Still, Franz Kline, Jackson Pollock, Willem de Kooning, David Smith and more, often lent by museums. That nothing is for sale is meant to impress, but it doesn't do much to reduce the aura of commercial savvy, or the sense that a history recounted often and better elsewhereright?/lg//yes/lb is being told yet again for all the wrong reasons. Haunch of Venison, 1230 Avenue of the Americas, near 49th Street, Manhattan, (212) 636-2034, haunchofvenison.com, through Nov. 12. (Smith)
 'BEGIN AGAIN RIGHT BACK HERE' With a small, early Sol LeWitt grid sculpture as touchstone, the curatorial debut of the artist B. Wurtz proves that less can be anything. The modest efforts of 14 artists, 3 designers and 1 writer -- including Vincent Fecteau, Sterling Ruby, Taylor Davis, Jessica Jackson Hutchins, Fawn Krieger, Anna Castelli and Wayne Koestenbaum -- variously mix aspects of sculpture, design object, architectural model, clothing or book. Their delicate mood is nicely confirmed or disrupted by smaller displays of Mark Barrow's texture-obsessed paintings; the raucous quilts of Violette Alby; and a 25-year survey of work by the talented Dan Asher, whose irresistible musical video ''Moonscape'' should not be missed. White Columns, 320 West 13th Street (entrance on Horatio Street), West Village, (212) 924-4212, whitecolumns.org, through Oct. 25. (Smith)
 'IMPLANT' Organized by a curator at the Horticultural Society of New York, ''Implant'' takes inspiration from Michael Pollan's 2001 book, ''The Botany of Desire,'' which suggests that plants are using us for evolutionary purposes just as much as we are using them. Musicians entertain the foliage in Peter Coffin's greenhouse; a tree in a digital animation by Hiraki Sawa trots on human legs through a Daliesque landscape. Roughly 100 works by 45 contemporary artists add to our sense of a gradual shift in the artist-plant relationship, from sublime awe in the face of nature to something more reciprocal. UBS Art Gallery, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, between 51st and 52nd Streets; (212) 713-2885, hsny.org, through Oct. 31.

 'OUT NOW!' The artist Anton Vidokle organized this exhibition to protest both the war in Iraq and the tepid response of American art institutions to that war. The work is tightly installed, text-intensive and hot with information. Among the contributors are the Irish journalist Patrick Cockburn; the peace activist Kathy Kelly; the writer Jalal Toufic; the artists Natasha Sadr Haghighian, Trevor Paglen and Martha Rosler; and the artist collective Friends of William Blake. E-Flux, 41 Essex Street, Lower East Side, (212) 619-3356, e-flux.com, through Nov 8. (Cotter)
 'THE POETICS OF CLOTH' Emphasizing the place of traditional textiles in works by contemporary African artists, this exhibition includes internationally renowned figures like the Nigerian-born Yinka Shonibare and the Ghanaian El Anatsui. One of the show's discoveries, Grace Ndiritu, uses printed fabrics in an evocative four-screen video installation -- allowing her bare limbs to peek out from behind curtains or posing as a mummified Olympia. A related show, ''The Essential Art of African Textiles: Design Without End,'' is at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart, through Dec. 6. (Rosenberg) 
 * 'SCULPTING TIME' This exceptionally beautiful exhibition features four painters who are famous for repeating themselves over many years: Josef Albers, On Kawara, Giorgio Morandi and Roman Opalka. (A fifth, Andrew Grassi, who creates small, technically impressive Photorealist paintings, seems to have wandered in from another exhibition.) Sparely installed in a warren of eight intimate rooms, the show turns the gallery into a numinous aesthetic funhouse. Sperone Westwater, 415 West 13th Street, West Village, (212) 999-7337, speronewestwater.com, through Nov. 1. (Johnson)
 TADASKY In the 1960s Tadasky (Tadasuke Kuwayama) painted optically captivating compositions of concentric rings on square canvases. Excellent examples are included in a retrospective exhibition at Sideshow and in D. Wigmore's ''Four Optic Visionaries,'' which also features works by Richard Anuszkiewicz, Sue Fuller and Mon Levinson, who were all included, along with Tadasky, in the Museum of Modern Art's famous 1965 exhibition ''The Responsive Eye.'' Sideshow, 319 Bedford Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 486-8180, sideshowgallery.com; through Oct. 19. D.

 Last Chance
 GUILD HALL MUSEUM: 'LARRY RIVERS: MAJOR EARLY WORKS' Tracking Larry Rivers's rapid evolution from figurative realism at the start of his career in the early 1950s to Pop-style history painting in the mid-'60s, this show reveals a terrifically fertile, energetic and daring talent discovering itself and lunging into the future. His 1955 painting of his corpulent mother-in-law, Berdie Burger -- who appears in the painting twice, both times nude -- is one of the great miracles of 20th-century American art. 158 Main Street, East Hampton, N.Y., (631) 324-0806, guildhall.org; closes on Sunday. 3/5cq 4/5 (Johnson)
 7DAVID HARRISON: 'GREEN AND PLEASANT LAND' The force of the New York debut of this London artist is somewhat muffled by the current profusion of retro, awkward and/or small-scale figurative painting and drawing (to which this gallery has certainly contributed). The best works merge goth suggestion, visionary light and Edwardian comportment, usually in landscapes with mysterious houses. Colors are rich; styles, subjects and paint handling vary; robust chunks of collage sometimes enter the pictures, as does an owl or two. Enough is happening to bode well for the future. Daniel Reich Gallery, 537A West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-4949, danielreichgallery.com; closes on Saturday. 3/5cq 4/5 (Smith)
 EUNICE KIM: 'MOON THE MAGIC LOSER' In her first gallery show Eunice Kim has created something like a walk-in Cornell box, only more ephemeral and overtly recycled. After lining the gallery's two exhibition spaces with sheets of newspaper, she populated it sparsely with sculptures and mobiles, all made of found materials and objects. Some are better than others, but the low-tech, light-touch transformation of the white cube is hard to beat. Canada, 55 Chrystie Street, near Hester Street, Lower East Side, (212) 925-4631, canadanewyork.com; closes on Sunday. (Smith)
 THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'PHOTOGRAPHY ON PHOTOGRAPHY: REFLECTIONS ON THE MEDIUM SINCE 1960' This second installation in the Met's new modern photography galleries is much better than the first, largely because of its variety of works (by artists male and female, young and old, American and European, famous and fledgling). Thomas Ruff and Hiroshi Sugimoto are here, but so are Janice Guy, an artist turned dealer who is benefiting from a sudden interest in her early self-portraits, and Mark Wyse, a young photographer who is also active as a curator. The show is also an excellent epilogue to the historical survey ''Framing a Century: Master Photographers 1840-1940,'' just across the hall in the Howard Gilman Gallery. If ''Framing a Century'' presents a hallowed history of photography, ''Photography on Photography'' gleefully violates that sanctity. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org; closes on Sunday. 3/5cq 4/5 (Rosenberg)
 STAN VANDERBEEK Stan VanDerBeek (1927-1984) was an experimental filmmaker, animator, computer graphics pioneer, painter, photographer, collagist and poet who was ahead of his time. He was globalist in his thinking, believed that aesthetics and science could fruitfully merge, and nurtured an avid faith -- one lost at present -- in the potential of art to change, for the better, the way people everywhere felt, acted and thought. Guild & Greyshkul, 28 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 625-9224; closes on Saturday. (Cotter)

PERSON: Y. C. Wang 

HEADLINE: Y. C. Wang, 91; Billionaire Led Formosa Plastics

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan 

 BODY:
Wang Yung-ching, who built his Formosa Plastics Group into Taiwan's biggest and most profitable manufacturing conglomerate, died Wednesday in New Jersey while on a business trip. He was 91. 
 His death was announced in a statement by Formosa Plastics. 
 A farmer's son with only an elementary school education, Mr. Wang set up a rice store with his two brothers in his early 20s. He then established the Formosa Plastics Corporation in 1954 with a loan from a United States aid program.
 Forbes listed Mr. Wang as the island's second-wealthiest person this year, with a personal fortune estimated at $6.8 billion.
 Known widely as the God of Management, Mr. Wang expanded his plastics and petrochemicals empire and diversified into electronics, cosmetics, hospitals and car manufacturing.
 A strong proponent of closer economic ties with rival China, Mr. Wang invested in power plants and plastics factories on the Chinese mainland. Formosa Plastics also set up chemical companies in the United States and owns several oil wells and properties rich in natural gas in Texas.
 Mr. Wang is said to have lived an austere life, staying in an apartment inside his group's headquarters in downtown Taipei. The group's immense success is partly attributed to a corporate culture emphasizing thrift and hard work.
 Formosa Plastics was accused in 1998 of dumping 3,000 tons of waste contaminated with high levels of mercury near the Cambodian port city of Sihanoukville, causing a local panic. The company later agreed to ship the waste back to Taiwan.
 Formosa Plastics said Mr. Wang assigned seven senior managers to run the group in 2006 and they will continue to oversee operations collectively after his death.
 Mr. Wang is survived by his wife, Lee Pao-chu; two sons; seven daughters; four sisters; and one brother. His son, Winston Wang, runs Grace T.H.W., a group active in petrochemicals and electronics in China. His daughter Cher Wang and her husband, Chen Wen-chi, run the chip developer VIA Technologies.

HEADLINE: New Building to Be Home For the Health Department

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration and Tishman Speyer Properties have struck a deal to move the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene and 2,700 of its employees to a planned $316 million office building in Long Island City, the first phase of a large-scale project designed to bolster a nascent business district in Queens. 
 The project, called Gotham Center, has been in the planning stages for more than three years. It is near Queens Plaza, at 28th Street and Thomson Avenue, where a six-story municipal garage now sits. Work has begun on demolishing that garage, widely considered to be an eyesore. Tishman Speyer completed the financing for the 21-story building last week and signed a lease with the health department.
 ''I'm so pleased we finally got here,'' said Deputy Mayor Robert C. Lieber. ''I think this is going to be huge for Long Island City. Hopefully, it will bring a vibrancy and more people to the area and catalyze the development'' of more retail and service businesses.
 The city has wanted to create an office district in Long Island City for companies unwilling to pay higher Midtown Manhattan rents. It is using government offices to anchor the project with the hope that private companies will follow. The move would also be enable the health department to consolidate some of its operations in more modern space, officials said.
 Citigroup built a 48-story tower nearby in the 1980s, and a second, smaller tower was recently completed across the street. But Long Island City has not quite caught on as an alternate commercial district.
 The new building would be the first step in Tishman Speyer's plan for 3.5 million square feet of housing, office and retail space. The Modell sporting goods family, which had owned some of the land, is a partner.
 The Bloomberg administration has been eager to promote new development projects, especially now that the economy has slowed after a long boom and developers are finding it almost impossible to get financing, delaying a number of projects.
 Tishman Speyer obtained financing from Wells Fargo for the Long Island City building, which will be occupied solely by the health department under a 20-year lease. The city comptroller, William C. Thompson Jr., said on Thursday that two municipal pension funds were also investing a total of $18.6 million as part of an ongoing agreement with Tishman Speyer to back some of Tishman's New York projects. He said the deal had benefited the city and the pension funds.
 ''We applaud the city's commitment to development, especially in this environment,'' said Rob Speyer, co-chief executive of Tishman Speyer.

HEADLINE: Three Rivals

 BODY:
Ukraine's president, Viktor Yushchenko, has called another parliamentary election -- the third in as many years -- in an attempt to resolve his never-ending political struggle with his rivals, Yulia Tymoshenko and Viktor Yanukovich, the current and former prime ministers. 
 We sympathize with Mr. Yushchenko's vision of anchoring his country in the West. And if new elections help clear up the political mess, well and good. The main thing is to make sure these are elections by and for Ukraine, without meddling from Russia or the West. 
 Mr. Yushchenko and Ms. Tymoshenko were allies and favorites of Europe and the United States in the so-called Orange Revolution of 2004. Thousands of Ukrainians went into the streets to overturn the rigged -- with lots of Russian help -- presidential election of Mr. Yanukovich. 
 The Orange allies quickly fell out. And Mr. Yanukovich was soon back in the Parliament -- and, for a spell, Mr. Yushchenko's prime minister. Ms. Tymoshenko now has that job, much to Mr. Yushchenko's dismay.
 While it sounds like a soap opera, the endless wrangling among the three has become a serious obstacle to Ukraine's hopes for political and economic reform. Ukraine's geographical division -- and deep-seated differences of identity and loyalty -- has made it even harder to build consensus. Mr. Yushchenko is supported by West-leaning Ukrainian nationalists in the country's west, Mr. Yanukovich by Russia-leaning eastern Ukrainians and Ms. Tymoshenko is seeking allies and advantage anywhere she can. 
 Ukrainians must be allowed to sort out their own problems. Russia's meddling in the name of a specious sphere of influence is unacceptable. Countering it with American pressures to join NATO will only stoke internal divisions, so long as Ukrainians are far from agreed about the alliance. 
 The better course at this stage is to encourage Ukraine's hopes of joining the European Union. Fearful of provoking Russia, the Europeans resisted American efforts to start moving Ukraine toward NATO membership. They should not drag their feet on European Union membership.
 All three of Ukraine's rival leaders have declared support for European Union membership. Letting them know that their country's chances will increase if they can work together might even help break the stalemate.

HEADLINE: Its Native Tongue Facing Extinction, Arapaho Tribe Teaches the Young

BYLINE: By DAN FROSCH

DATELINE: RIVERTON, Wyo. 

 BODY:
At 69, her eyes soft and creased with age, Alvena Oldman remembers how the teachers at St. Stephens boarding school on the Wind River Reservation would strike students with rulers if they dared to talk in their native Arapaho language. 
 ''We were afraid to speak it,'' she said. ''We knew we would be punished.'' 
 More than a half-century later, only about 200 Arapaho speakers are still alive, and tribal leaders at Wind River, Wyoming's only Indian reservation, fear their language will not survive. As part of an intensifying effort to save that language, this tribe of 8,791, known as the Northern Arapaho, recently opened a new school where students will be taught in Arapaho. Elders and educators say they hope it will create a new generation of native speakers. 
 ''This is a race against the clock, and we're in the 59th minute of the last hour,'' said a National Indian Education Association board member, Ryan Wilson, whom the tribe hired as a consultant to help get the school off the ground. Like other tribes, the Northern Arapaho have suffered from the legacy of Indian boarding institutions, established by the federal government in the late 1800s to ''Americanize'' Native American children. It was at such schools that teachers instilled the ''kill the Indian, save the man'' philosophy, young boys had their traditional braids shorn, and students were forbidden to speak tribal languages. 
 The discipline of those days was drummed into an entire generation of Northern Arapaho, and most tribal members never passed down the language. Of all the remaining fluent speakers, none are younger than 55. 
 That is what tribal leaders hope to change. About 22 children from pre-kindergarten through first grade started classes at the school -- a rectangular one-story structure with a fresh coat of white paint and the words Hinono' Eitiino' Oowu' (translation: Arapaho Language Lodge) written across its siding. 
 Here, set against an endless stretch of windswept plains and tufts of cottonwoods, instructors are using a state-approved curriculum to teach students exclusively in Arapaho. All costs related to the school, which has an operating budget of $340,000 a year, are paid for by the tribe and private donors. Administrators plan to add a grade each year until it comprises pre-kindergarten through 12th-grade classes.
 ''This environment is a complete reversal of what occurs too often in schools, where a child is ridiculed or reprimanded for speaking one's heritage language,'' said Inee Y. Slaughter, executive director of the Indigenous Language Institute, a group in Santa Fe, N.M., that works with tribes on native languages. 
 ''I want my son to talk nothing but Arapaho to me and my grandparents,'' said Kayla Howling Buffalo, who enrolled her 4-year-old son, RyLee, in the school. 
 Ms. Howling Buffalo, 25, said she, too, had been inspired to take Arapaho classes because her grandmother no longer has anyone to speak with and fears she is losing her first language. 
 Such sentiments are not uncommon on the reservation and have become more pronounced in the five years since Helen Cedar Tree, at 96 the oldest living Northern Arapaho, made an impassioned plea to the tribe's council of elders. 
 ''She said: 'Look at all of you guys talking English, and you know your own language. It's like the white man has conquered us,' '' said Gerald Redman Sr., the chairman of the council of elders. ''It was a wake-up call.'' 
 A group of Arapaho families had sent their children to a pre-kindergarten language program for years, but it was not enough. Heeding Ms. Cedar Tree's words, the tribe began using Arapaho dictionaries, night classes, CDs made by the tribe, and anything they could find to help resuscitate the language. In the end, ''we knew in our hearts that immersion was the only way we were going to turn this around,'' said Mr. Wilson, a member of the Oglala Lakota tribe. 
 He was referring not just to the potential for the Arapaho language's extinction but to a host of other problems that have long plagued the vast reservation, which the tribe shares with the Eastern Shoshone. 
 ''Language-immersion schools offer an environment that goes beyond teaching the language,'' Ms. Slaughter said. ''It provides a safe place where a child's roots are nurtured, its culture honored, and its being valued.'' 
 According to tribal statistics and the United States Attorney's Office in Wyoming, 78 percent of household heads on the reservation are unemployed, the student dropout rate is 52 percent and crime has been rising. 
 Most recently, in June, three teenage girls were found dead in a low-income housing complex. The F.B.I. has not yet released autopsy results, but many tribal members think drugs or alcohol were involved. The deaths left the reservation reeling. Officials here hope that the school will herald a positive change, just as programs elsewhere have helped native youth become conversational in their tribal languages, enhancing cultural pride and participation in the process. A groundswell of language revitalization efforts has led to successful Indian immersion schools in Hawaii, Montana and New York. 
 Studies show that language fluency among young Indians is tied to overall academic achievement, and experts say such learning can have other positive effects. 
 ''Language seems to be a healing force for Native American communities,'' said Ellen Lutz, executive director of Cultural Survival, a group based in Cambridge, Mass., that is working with the Northern Arapaho. At a recent ceremony to celebrate the school's opening, held in an old tribal meeting hall, three young girls sang shyly in Arapaho. Behind them, a row of elders sat quietly, their faces wizened and stoic, legs shuffling rhythmically as familiar words carried through the building. 
 ''They are the ones who whispered it on the playground when nobody was looking,'' Mr. Wilson said, referring to the elders. ''If we lose that language, we lose who we are.'' 

CORRECTION-DATE: October 23, 2008

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Friday about a new school in Wyoming that will teach students in Arapaho in hope of preserving the language described similar schools in Hawaii incorrectly. They are native Hawaiian language schools; they are not Indian immersion schools like ones in Wyoming, Montana and New York. 
An article on Friday about a new school in Wyoming that will teach students in Arapaho in hopes of preserving the language referred incorrectly to the school's curriculum. The curriculum, which will be taught in the Arapaho language, is based on a curriculum used at the Wyoming Indian Elementary School, a public school that teaches its students in English and adheres to Wyoming state education standards. The state did not specifically approve an Arapaho curriculum for the new school.

HEADLINE: Canada and Europe Ponder Trade Pact

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

DATELINE: OTTAWA 

 BODY:
Since the first free trade agreement between the United States and Canada, 20 years ago this month, Canada's economy has become increasingly integrated with that of the United States. On Friday, with the American economy in disarray and its global leadership in question, Canada will take what appears to be a step back from that relationship.
 Following a meeting in Quebec City, Canada's prime minister, Stephen Harper, and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, who is the president of the European Union as well, are expected to sign an agreement for preliminary negotiations meant to create a trade pact between Canada and Europe that would be even more sweeping than the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
 A person who is familiar with the government's plan, but who did not want to be identified as upstaging an announcement by two heads of state, said the agreement would begin ''a scoping exercise leading to the launch of talks.'' 
 It follows the release Thursday of a 192-page study by the Canadian and European governments that concludes such a deal could increase exports from Canada to Europe by 20.6 percent by 2014. 
 Thomas P. d'Aquino, the chief executive and president of the Canadian Council of Chief Executives, a lobbying group, said in an interview that a deal for Canada and Europe could, in the long run, also involve the United States.
 ''One of the arguments I'll be sensitive to from Americans is, 'Now that we're in trouble, you're turning your back on us,' '' Mr. d'Aquino said from Chicago, where he is speaking on trade issues. ''But this is not about us saying that we're tired of having our eggs in one basket. It would be an excellent step to doing something more ambitious on trans-Atlantic trade.''
 Although proximity has made the United States Canada's top trading partner, there have been many attempts to reduce the country's economic dependence on its neighbor to the south. 
 When Pierre Elliot Trudeau was prime minister he championed what he called a ''third option'' which emphasized increasing trade with Europe and Asia.
 Political resistance in both Canada and Europe, as well as business disinterest, stymied such efforts. 
 Trade with the United States made up about 37 percent of Canada's gross domestic product in 1990 and rose above 65 percent 10 years later. (It has generally been just under that peak for most of this decade.)
 The preliminary trade deal suggested by the study, which was released by the European Union but not by Canada, exceeds Nafta in some respects. If adopted it would minimize barriers in services, include sales to government, open up the air travel market and allow skilled Canadians and Europeans to work across borders without visas.
 Mr. d'Aquino said that Canada's experience with the first trade agreement and Nafta meant that most Canadian governments and businesses would welcome a European pact. Any deal would also require provincial approval on many issues. 
 Jean Charest, the premier of Quebec, has been among the most prominent proponents for a deal. Europe's enthusiasm, it seems, is largely a product of Mr. Sarkozy, who has a long relationship with the Montreal financier Paul G. Desmarais Sr. Through the Power Corporation of Canada, Mr. Desmarais and his family control investments in several prominent European companies, including the French oil and gas company Total and GDF Suez, a major gas and water utility operator. 
 The preliminary work leading up to Friday's announcement has passed relatively unnoticed in Canada. 
 But the 1988 trade deal and, to a lesser extent Nafta, were polarizing issues. Maude Barlow, the chairwoman of the Council of Canadians, a group that was formed in part to protest the first trade talks with the United States, acknowledged that there might be less public debate over a deal with Europe.
 ''It doesn't involve one big, dominating superpower,'' she said. ''Europe seems far away, it seems benign.''
 Ms. Barlow is concerned that a sweeping deal would open up the privatization of traditionally public services in Canada, such as water utilities. 
 But she and her supporters may not have much to worry about, at least in the view of Michael Hart, a professor of trade policy at Carleton University in Ottawa and a former senior trade official.
 Mr. Hart is skeptical Mr. Sarkozy will win over Europe's trade bureaucrats, and he said that Canadian companies that want to do business in Europe would generally continue to invest there rather than export merchandise from Canada.
 ''There are things we can do with Europe,'' he said. ''But there's not a basis for a full-fledged agreement.''

 AMERICAN BALLET THEATER (Tuesday through Thursday) A gala is the customary start to Ballet Theater's annual fall season, and this one attempts a compromise between a taste of the two-week season to come and gala-suitable fare. The season features Ballet Theater celebrating the centennial of the birth of Antony Tudor (slightly ahead of time, since he was born in 1909) by performing at least one of his ballets -- including ''The Leaves Are Fading,'' ''Pillar of Fire,'' ''Jardin aux Lilas'' -- on each program. The gala (and an all-Tudor evening on Oct. 31) includes a special performance of Tudor's ''Romeo and Juliet'' pas de deux, an excerpt from one of his more rarely seen ballets, originally choreographed for Ballet Theater in 1943. Another excerpt, from Jiri Kylian's ''Overgrown Path,'' prefigures the full-company premiere of the piece, made as a tribute to Tudor, on Thursday. Also on the program are the Act III pas de deux from ''Don Quixote'' and a solo by Craig Salstein for Michele Wiles, as well as Balanchine's ''Theme and Variations'' and Paul Taylor's ''Company B'' (also a new work for the company). On Wednesday and Thursday nights, Ballet Theater gets down to business as usual, with mixed repertory programs. 
But look out for a new work on Wednesday and thereafter by Lauri Stallings, whose intriguingly kinetic, propulsive style is strongly influenced by her years as a dancer with Ohad Naharin's Batsheva Dance Company. (Through Nov. 2) At 7:30 p.m., City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org; $25 to 110. (Roslyn Sulcas)
 LUCIANA ACHUGAR (Tuesday through Thursday) Luciana Achugar has made several pieces in which she explores the nature of shared experience between audience and performer, and in her new piece ''The Sublime Is Us,'' she takes things a step further. Instead of presenting her work in Dance Theater Workshop's theater, she will show it in the David R. White Studio on the third floor so that the audience is essentially in the performance space. As Tere O'Connor showed so well in his ''Rammed Earth,'' watching dance blossom around you is a very different experience from seeing it at a remove onstage. Here's an opportunity to see Ms. Achugar's dancers -- the wonderful Hilary Clark among them -- up very close indeed. (Through Nov. 1) On Wednesday there will be a post-show talk with Levi Gonzalez; on Thursday a pre-show talk at 6.30 p.m. with Victoria Anderson Davies. At 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; $26; $15 for students and 65+. (Sulcas)
 BALLET HISPANICO (Friday through Sunday) Tina Ramirez, who founded the company in 1970 and is stepping down this season as artistic director, has assembled a rich repertory that includes the premieres of Carlos Sierra Lopez's ''Destino Incierto,'' inspired by ''Carmen,'' and Jean Emile's ''Tres Bailes,'' a tribute to the dancers' athleticism. Live music will enrich every performance. Friday at 8 p.m.; Saturday at 2 p.m. and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m.; Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $19 to $49. (Jack Anderson)
 BANGARRA DANCE THEATER (Tuesday and Thursday) This Australian company has been exploring the interstices between Aboriginal traditions and contemporary dance since it was founded in 1989, and the dancing is reliably thrilling, even if the themes of the works tend to be alike. On the program for the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Next Wave Festival is Stephen Page's ''Awakenings,'' a dance about forgotten Aboriginal rituals. (Through Oct. 25.) At 7:30 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music Harvey Theater, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $20 to $45. (Sulcas)
 TRAJAL HARRELL (Friday and Saturday) Many people have been moved by Olivier Messiaen's creation of the ''Quartet for the End of Time,'' which he composed while being held in a Nazi prison camp. But who other than the marvelous choreographer and dancer Trajal Harrell would have thought to reframe it ''as a hoochie-koochie show''? They don't make many artists like Mr. Harrell; his sophisticated, nuanced works are not to be missed. At 7:30 p.m., Dance Theater Workshop, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, dtw.org; $26. (Claudia La Rocco)
 ODC/DANCE (Tuesday through Thursday) This San Francisco company was actually founded at Oberlin College in Ohio, hence its name, which stands for Oberlin Dance Collective. But the group has been on the West Coast since 1976 and is still run by its founder Brenda Way, who has established an impressive contemporary arts institution there that includes a dance school, a company and a theater. Apparently she finds time to choreograph too: ODC brings three pieces by Ms. Way and one by K T Nelson, the company's co-artistic director. (Through Oct. 26.) Tuesday and Wednesday at 7.30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $19 to $49. (Sulcas)
 ROSAS (Wednesday and Thursday) The Belgian choreographer Anne Teresa De Keersmaeker has remained one of contemporary dance's most important voices since her striking 1982 ''Fase,'' which was partly choreographed during a year's study in New York. That four-part piece was set to music by Steve Reich, whose work Ms. De Keersmaeker first encountered as a student, and which she has continued to choreograph to over the last 25 years. In ''Steve Reich Evening'' she shows two older works -- the justly famous duo ''Piano Phase'' from ''Fase'' and Part 1 of ''Drumming'' -- as well as two pieces, ''Eight Lines'' and ''Four Organs,'' created last year for this program. Ms. De Keersmaeker also offers her own curatorial take on Mr. Reich's oeuvre by adding his ''Pendulum Music'' and ''Marimba Phase'' and Ligeti's ''Poeme symphonique pour cent metronomes'' to the evening. (Through Oct. 25.) At 7.30 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music Opera House, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $20 to $55. (Sulcas)
 SAN FRANCISCO BALLET (Friday and Saturday) The final three performances by the San Francisco Ballet offer a last chance to see two of the three programs that the company brought along as part of its 75th-anniversary tour. A Saturday matinee features works by the artistic director Helgi Tomasson and two pieces by Val Caniparoli and Jorma Elo, created for the company's recent New Works festival. On Saturday night an even more alluring program offers Balanchine's glorious ''Divertimento No. 15'' and works by Christopher Wheeldon and Yuri Possokhov, also New Works commissions. Friday at 8 p.m.; Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m.; City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org; $30 to 110. (Sulcas)
 ROSEANNE SPRADLIN (Thursday) RoseAnne Spradlin's works aren't a sink-back-in-your-seat kind of experience; they tend to be gritty and confrontational, visceral and raw. But even when you have reservations about Ms. Spradlin's work, it's not unusual to still be thinking about her images and ideas weeks after you've seen a piece. Her new work ''Blue Liz'' takes imagery, text and sound from the 1960s to explore the idea of ''the cultural transformation of America'' and a ''wartime mindset.'' Sounds timely. (Through Oct 25.) At 8 p.m., the Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-5793, thekitchen.org; $15; $12 for students and 65+. (Sulcas)
 TAMI STRONACH DANCE (Thursday) ''How can giving too much be as devastating as too little?'' asks Tami Stronach (according to press materials) in her new ''But it's for you.'' This question seems like a complex matter of economics well suited to the current moment, although how Ms. Stronach will address it choreographically remains to be seen. An eight-foot helium balloon is featured too, and the piece has sets by the lighting design wizard Joe Levasseur. (Through Oct. 25.) At 8.30 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (212) 674-8194, danspaceproject.org; $18. (Sulcas)
 JO STROMGREN KOMPANI (Friday through Sunday) The connection between Scandinavia and Performance Space 122 continues with the New York premiere of the Norwegian dance-theater troupe Jo Stromgren Kompani, a presentation of P.S. 122 and the Abrons Arts Center. The work is called ''The Society.'' Expect strangeness. Friday and Saturday at 8:30 p.m., Sunday at 6:30 p.m., Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (212) 352-3101, ps122.org; $15 to 25. (La Rocco)
 DARIO VACCARO DANCE PROJECT (Thursday) What exactly was Dario Vaccaro thinking when he called his new piece ''Zonko -- From The Moment of Conception''? Perhaps it will be good anyway, since Mr. Vaccaro has a reputation for accomplished work and excellent dancers. The Joyce's Web site promises ''an exquisitely captivating aesthetic experience.'' Let's hope so. (Through Oct. 26.) At 8 p.m. (Thursday benefit performance at 7:30 p.m.), Joyce Soho, 155 Mercer Street, (212) 352-3101, joyce.org; $25; $15 for students and 65+; $100 for the benefit.

HEADLINE: Region's Small Businesses in Path of a Financial Hurricane

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN and KEN BELSON

 BODY:
Ms. Blau, 34, president of On Location Tours in Midtown Manhattan, started her company in 1999 after graduating from Skidmore College. With a staff of six full-time employees and about two dozen part-time guides, she operates bus tours of New York locations from popular movies and television shows, most prominently ''Sex and the City.'' While foreign tourists have been a boon for her, sales to Americans have declined 20 percent this year. Now, with Europe's economy in trouble and the dollar rising, she is worried that international travel will also fall sharply. 
 Travel's a luxury, so they're not going to come to New York. They're going to pay their gas bill first. We were pretty strong through the end of August. There's a natural drop in September, but we had more of a drop than normal.
 In the past week alone, we've seen five U.K. tour companies go out of business. We've seen people from about 10 countries, mainly, so I think we'll be O.K. because a lot of the U.K. will be absorbed by another country. 
 We're also hoping that rather than hiring more employees, we might also be able to do things with interns and move forward like that. A lot of our work can be done by interns who are going to school. But I'm thinking, just a really rough guess, it could be down 20 percent in 2009.
 We recently launched a movie tour in Washington, D.C., but we're prepared to start that slowly. A lot of Washington is also dependent on international visitors, so we'll see where that goes. We went through 9/11. We're kind of trained on being able to cut back on things that need to be cut back, and to do it in a fast way.

HEADLINE: Recession in New York City: Dark Clouds, Some Still on the Horizon

BYLINE: By FORD FESSENDEN

HEADLINE: The Lion, the Bull and the Bears

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
What's been going on in the stock market hardly fits canonical notions of rationality. In the last month or so, shares in Bank of America plunged to $26, bounced to $37, slid to $30, rebounded to $38, plummeted to $20, sprung above $26 and skidded back to almost $24 on Thursday. Evidently, people don't have a clue of what Bank of America is worth. 
 It is hard to believe that stock prices are being driven by a rational assessment of value. Investors seem to be relying on the same primitive emotion that made our forebears on the savanna bolt when approached by a hungry lion: fear. 
 Of course, fear can be rational, as the experience with the lion might suggest. But the dynamics of the financial mess suggests that -- on the way up and on the way down -- investors, regulators, policy makers and homeowners have been operating by gut-driven nostrums rather than hardheaded analysis of facts. Behavioral economists politely refer to this as cognitively flawed heuristics. 
 The world is a complex place, so it's understandable that we'll try to master it by using simple rules. The problem is they are often wrong -- like the incorrect yet popular belief that past behavior, say soaring house prices, is a good guide to future performance. Unable to make quantitative judgments about risky propositions, we often decide based on the best and worst possible scenarios regardless of their probabilities. That leads to binary decisions like going all in when the going is good and pulling out in panic when the tide turns.
 These quirks are magnified by our well-known tendency to herd. We use other people's behavior to validate ours -- allowing ourselves to believe that housing is a good investment because our neighbor does. 
 There are such things as well-thought-out financial runs. The gyrations of the Bank of America stock might be caused by rational investors trying to puzzle out whether the bank will survive the crisis in good shape. 
 Even the rise and fall of American housing finance could be spun as a tale of flawless logic: homeowners and banks bet on reasonable forecasts that home prices would continue to rise. When they didn't, defaults rose and banks became insolvent. Other banks ceased lending to them. Investors sold bank shares. The End.
 I don't think so. There is another big psychological distortion to account for: our tendency to believe our own theory of the world. Consider the former Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan's repeated insistence during the housing price run-up that there was nothing to fear. Though he once warned about irrational exuberance, Mr. Greenspan lived by the belief that unfettered markets always lead to optimal outcomes.
 ''Not only have individual financial institutions become less vulnerable to shocks from underlying risk factors, but also the financial system as a whole has become more resilient,'' he said in 2004. After the past few weeks, he might want to reconsider. EDUARDO PORTER

HEADLINE: Ruby-Red Stairs With View of the Great White Way

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
The best seats on Broadway are now absolutely free.
 After the longest out-of-town tryout in history, a new TKTS booth opened on Thursday in Duffy Square, eight years later and nine times costlier than originally estimated.
 What the extra time and money bought, besides headaches and heartaches for the project's sponsors and the thousands of patrons who line up for discount theater tickets every day, is nothing less than a new way of seeing the Times Square ''bowtie,'' that dazzling intersection of Broadway and Seventh Avenue. 
 That is because the TKTS booth proper is topped by a sweeping cascade of 27 ruby-red structural glass steps, rising to a height of 16 feet 1 inch above the 47th Street sidewalk, where hundreds of people (as many as 1,500 if they squeeze in tight) will be welcome to congregate every day until 1 a.m.
 Those who make it to the top -- and it seems to be the natural instinct of just about everyone to make that beeline -- will be rewarded by a kinetic panorama: the perfect picture-postcard angle on the colossal sluice of entertainment, commerce and humanity that has bedazzled Americans and bemused foreign visitors for more than a century.
 It is as if all the lights of the Great White Way, not just one side or another, not just one sign or another, were on display simultaneously. The developers of the TKTS booth and the expanded and re-landscaped plaza around it -- the Theater Development Fund, the Times Square Alliance and the Coalition for Father Duffy -- have finally provided the bleachers that make it possible to take in this spectacle.
 ''People in offices around Times Square have had a sense of it,'' said Victoria Bailey, executive director of the Theater Development Fund. ''But now it belongs to everybody.''
 And could there be a better moment for a truly public amenity, where the price of admission is zero, than now, when the clouds of a long recession are gathering? 
 ''It's a bright light in a dark economic time,'' said Tim Tompkins, president of the Times Square Alliance. 
 The former headquarters of Lehman Brothers is clearly visible two blocks north of the Duffy Square steps, as if to underscore the point. But the stairway itself is so bright and so polished that visitors could be convinced they had stepped momentarily out of 2008 and onto the set of some fizzy Busby Berkeley extravaganza.
 Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who joined the confetti-tossing ceremony to mark the opening of the stairway to nowhere (and everywhere), said the city picked up $11.5 million of the $19 million cost of the project. As he went on to discuss the importance of investing in culture and the arts, the clouds above broke briefly. ''The sun comes out right when I say that,'' the mayor noted.
 Mr. Tompkins said he hoped that the steps would ''create a new standard for the public realm in Times Square.''
 As far as behavior standards are concerned, he said, visitors will be expected to follow the conduct guidelines common to any city park, as Duffy Square is technically city parkland. Employees of the alliance, which runs the Times Square business improvement district, will clean, maintain and guard the structure. It may be designated a no-smoking zone.
 Eating and drinking, however, are expected and encouraged. ''Stoop-sitting will take on a whole new meaning,'' said Janette Sadik-Khan, the city transportation commissioner, as she made her way down the steps on Thursday.
 Along the business end of the staircase, on 47th Street, TKTS patrons will find 12 ticket windows, 20 percent more than the old Duffy Square booth, which opened in 1973 and closed in 2006. They will also find that they can use credit cards for the first time, in addition to cash and traveler's checks.
 The TKTS booth proper is a fiberglass shell fabricated by Merrifield-Roberts of Bristol, R.I., which also makes boat hulls. The overall structure was designed by Nicholas S. Leahy and his colleagues at Perkins Eastman, based on a competition-winning concept by the architects John Choi and Tai Ropiha. William Fellows was the landscape architect. Dewhurst Macfarlane & Partners were the structural engineers.
 Duffy Square, the north end of the Times Square bowtie, is named for the Rev. Francis P. Duffy, a civic and neighborhood hero in his day, who was chaplain to the 69th New York Infantry regiment during World War I and pastor of the nearby Holy Cross Roman Catholic Church. A bronze likeness, in front of a Celtic cross, stands at the foot of the stairs. The triangular square gained extra space in the redevelopment project by annexing one lane of Broadway and one lane of Seventh Avenue.
 The project, announced in 1999, was bedeviled at almost every turn, most recently by the sudden failure of the Scottish glass manufacturer Haran Glass. In the end, the designers turned to Eckelt Glass of Austria, which fabricated the multilayer panels that make up the structure.
 Though no one wanted to dwell on the tortuous process during Thursday's ceremony, everyone remarked on it.
 ''Talk about living in glass houses,'' said Adrian Benepe, the city parks commissioner. ''Try building one.''

HEADLINE: Small Businesses in a Financial Hurricane

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN and KEN BELSON

 BODY:
A butcher's longtime customers stop paying their bills. A building contractor has half as many jobs as he did a year ago. A restaurant owner considers sharing space to stay afloat. Steadily, inexorably, the fallout from Wall Street's layoffs and the credit crisis is trickling down to small businesses across the region. Over the coming months, The New York Times will track six of those businesses to see how they are weathering the economic storm.
 Downtown's Lean Time
 Mouhamad Shami, 54, the owner of Alfanoose, a Middle Eastern restaurant on Maiden Lane in the financial district, came to the United States in 1974 and opened his restaurant in 1999, operating it with three employees: his wife; his daughter, who plans to attend law school; and his son, a junior at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. Sales have dropped by nearly 30 percent as layoffs have mounted at nearby banks and brokerage houses, causing him to scrap plans to serve breakfast and to consider asking the deli next door to share his space and split the rent. 
 ''It's scary, to tell you the truth. I can feel it, the cutting back. Our business depends on orders from the big financial companies. A.I.G., they used to order from us. Goldman Sachs, they cut down a lot. Citigroup, I hardly get any orders from them anymore.
 ''They are afraid. I am afraid. It's crazy and it's scary. I'm afraid more for my kids' future.
 ''I'll do everything I can, honestly, to stay in business. As is, I put in long hours. Like I said, the whole family works in this establishment. And we take a pride of what we do. So we built a name and a good reputation. And we don't want to lose it.
 ''We did bounce back after Sept. 11. I did have to start all over again, my wife and I. But we survived. This is America. We are built strong.''
 Less Light in the Freezer
 Michael Menna, 47, the owner of Menna's Quality Meats and Salumeria in the Throgs Neck section of the Bronx and the father of two young girls, has managed his family's 50-year-old meat market for the last 14 years. He is being squeezed by rising energy, transportation and food costs (he also took on two new employees this year) and declining demand: He estimates that business is down 20 percent this year.
 ''You see customers buying less. They are just buying what they need. Maybe one pound of chicken cutlets. They are buying much less in bulk. People are also using credit cards more. No one has cash anymore. 
 ''I condensed all my freezers downstairs. From two chest freezers to one chest freezer. From three walk-in boxes to two walk-in boxes. These lights, they have four bulbs in each, we cut them down to two in each. Con Ed. That's the real killer for me. Close to $4,000 a month. It's come down about $600. 
 ''I noticed they are staying away from the good steaks, like a rib-eye that is higher, like $11.99. They'll buy something that is cheaper, a sirloin or the boneless club steaks for $5.99. Everyone loves the rib-eye, my favorite as well, but you buy four of them for a family of four, it could be expensive.
 ''Sometimes if somebody doesn't pay, you lose the customer and you lose the money. You try to remind them at the end of the month to get a check or get paid. It is awkward, especially with people you know so long. I'm not one to push people, either, but I get hurt.
 ''We're holding our own, just trying to keep our head above water, just trying to survive like I believe everybody else is trying to do, trying to make the right business decisions, trying to conserve and hope for the best in '09, have a strong holiday season and keep your head above water.''
 No Rush to Fix Up
 Ruben Villasante, 46, owner of V & V Construction in Ditmas Park, Brooklyn, and father of two sons, immigrated from Uruguay in 1986. He has been in business for 17 years, running a small contracting firm that specializes in painting and home renovations in a mainly upper-middle-class section of Brooklyn. He typically employs nine workers during the busy months. But with half as many jobs as he had last year, he has been operating with only his four regular workers. 
 ''It's down. The economy is bad and people don't have the money, though I work in a neighborhood that is middle-class.
 ''In my kind of work, it's the first kind of thing you see, because when people cut down on expenses, they put money where they really need it, like schools and colleges, and wait for the new bathroom a year. In this neighborhood, it's changing. 
 ''In the summertime, we usually do a lot of overtime, and work Saturday and Sunday. We haven't done overtime this year. This summer, we haven't been working on the weekends because there is no rush.
 ''Last year, you could see two, three guys doing the same work when you drive around. But now it's just the old-timers like me. 
 ''Everything went up, delivery, supplies. The price of cedar doubled this year from last year. You have to include it in the price. The labor is just the same. 
 Slowdown in Sightseeing
 Georgette Blau, 34, president of On Location Tours in Midtown Manhattan, started her company in 1999 after graduating from Skidmore College. With a staff of six full-time employees and about two dozen part-time guides, she operates bus tours of New York locations from popular movies and television shows, most prominently ''Sex and the City.'' While foreign tourists have been a boon for her, sales to Americans have declined 20 percent this year. Now, with Europe's economy in trouble and the dollar rising, she is worried that international travel will also fall sharply. 
 ''Travel's a luxury, so they're not going to come to New York. They're going to pay their gas bill first. We were pretty strong through the end of August. There's a natural drop in September, but we had more of a drop than normal.
 ''In the past week alone, we've seen five U.K. tour companies go out of business. We've seen people from about 10 countries, mainly, so I think we'll be O.K. because a lot of the U.K. will be absorbed by another country. 
 ''We're also hoping that rather than hiring more employees, we might also be able to do things with interns and move forward like that. A lot of our work can be done by interns who are going to school. But I'm thinking, just a really rough guess, it could be down 20 percent in 2009.
 ''We recently launched a movie tour in Washington, D.C., but we're prepared to start that slowly. A lot of Washington is also dependent on international visitors, so we'll see where that goes. We went through 9/11. We're kind of trained on being able to cut back on things that need to be cut back, and to do it in a fast way.'' 
 Triple Threat to Car Sales
 Lawrence Vayda, 65, sales manager at Parkfield Saab in Rochelle Park, N.J., has been selling cars for 17 years, the last four at Parkfield Saab. The dealership, with six salesmen, had done a booming business in lease-sales deals, but business has been off mainly because of high gasoline prices, tightening credit and financial industry layoffs. Now Saab's parent company, General Motors, is reported to be dangerously low on cash and in merger talks with Chrysler.
 ''My best estimate is we are three years out from having it all wash out. Apparently, the entire automobile landscape has been impacted. Sales are down across the board. Several years ago, they were talking about 16 million cars sold a year. Now they are down 20 percent from what they predicted. 
 ''It used to be if you were creditworthy, the banks would finance the entire amount. But now they want 10 to 20 percent down. It's a concern for consumers. It's a new reality. Lessees were unaccustomed to mobilizing large amounts of capital. They wanted to drive around in a nice vehicle without having to put large amounts of money down. 
 ''This is the worst I've seen it. The possibility of a merger is indeed in my mind. I worry that if G.M. and Chrysler merge, I don't know their motives. It's always a cause for concern. Saab is unique, but it's wholly owned by G.M. When you're in the retail business, you have to have products that people want. I want to see them being less numbers driven and more product driven. It ultimately affects my ability to make a living.''
 Facing Soaring Costs
 Al Venditti, 35, is manager of sales and customer service at Worksman Cycles in Ozone Park, Queens.
 The company, founded as a bicycle shop in 1898, produces heavy-duty industrial bicycles and tricycles. Sales to longtime customers in government, manufacturing and the military have been steady. But the company, with 60 employees, is limiting overtime and cutting overhead by means including the installation of solar panels.
 ''Everything that we purchase has gone up in price over the last year. We used to change our pricing moderately every three years. We've had to change pricing three times this year already, which we've never had to do before. If we got a 3 percent price increase from a supplier, that's understandable. But when it jumps 20 percent three times in a year, that's unprecedented.
 ''The bicycle industry is kind of like alcohol: When times are good, people drink. When times are bad, people drink.
 ''We're busier than we've ever been because of high gas prices. This is one of the highest years we've ever had, but the profits get chipped away because the costs have gone up so much. 
 ''The economy can't stay like this. We're just going through a slump. We'll be O.K. I'm not worried. We'll see what happens after the election. They're both tooting change. After seeing what they were able to do for Wall Street, I think they have the power to change anything they want to.''

HEADLINE: Let's Get Fiscal

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
The Dow is surging! No, it's plunging! No, it's surging! No, it's ...
 Nevermind. While the manic-depressive stock market is dominating the headlines, the more important story is the grim news coming in about the real economy. It's now clear that rescuing the banks is just the beginning: the nonfinancial economy is also in desperate need of help. 
 And to provide that help, we're going to have to put some prejudices aside. It's politically fashionable to rant against government spending and demand fiscal responsibility. But right now, increased government spending is just what the doctor ordered, and concerns about the budget deficit should be put on hold. 
 Before I get there, let's talk about the economic situation. 
 Just this week, we learned that retail sales have fallen off a cliff, and so has industrial production. Unemployment claims are at steep-recession levels, and the Philadelphia Fed's manufacturing index is falling at the fastest pace in almost 20 years. All signs point to an economic slump that will be nasty, brutish -- and long.
 How nasty? The unemployment rate is already above 6 percent (and broader measures of underemployment are in double digits). It's now virtually certain that the unemployment rate will go above 7 percent, and quite possibly above 8 percent, making this the worst recession in a quarter-century.
 And how long? It could be very long indeed.
 Think about what happened in the last recession, which followed the bursting of the late-1990s technology bubble. On the surface, the policy response to that recession looks like a success story. Although there were widespread fears that the United States would experience a Japanese-style ''lost decade,'' that didn't happen: the Federal Reserve was able to engineer a recovery from that recession by cutting interest rates.
 But the truth is that we were looking Japanese for quite a while: the Fed had a hard time getting traction. Despite repeated interest rate cuts, which eventually brought the federal funds rate down to just 1 percent, the unemployment rate just kept on rising; it was more than two years before the job picture started to improve. And when a convincing recovery finally did come, it was only because Alan Greenspan had managed to replace the technology bubble with a housing bubble. 
 Now the housing bubble has burst in turn, leaving the financial landscape strewn with wreckage. Even if the ongoing efforts to rescue the banking system and unfreeze the credit markets work -- and while it's early days yet, the initial results have been disappointing -- it's hard to see housing making a comeback any time soon. And if there's another bubble waiting to happen, it's not obvious. So the Fed will find it even harder to get traction this time. 
 In other words, there's not much Ben Bernanke can do for the economy. He can and should cut interest rates even more -- but nobody expects this to do more than provide a slight economic boost.
 On the other hand, there's a lot the federal government can do for the economy. It can provide extended benefits to the unemployed, which will both help distressed families cope and put money in the hands of people likely to spend it. It can provide emergency aid to state and local governments, so that they aren't forced into steep spending cuts that both degrade public services and destroy jobs. It can buy up mortgages (but not at face value, as John McCain has proposed) and restructure the terms to help families stay in their homes.
 And this is also a good time to engage in some serious infrastructure spending, which the country badly needs in any case. The usual argument against public works as economic stimulus is that they take too long: by the time you get around to repairing that bridge and upgrading that rail line, the slump is over and the stimulus isn't needed. Well, that argument has no force now, since the chances that this slump will be over anytime soon are virtually nil. So let's get those projects rolling.
 Will the next administration do what's needed to deal with the economic slump? Not if Mr. McCain pulls off an upset. What we need right now is more government spending -- but when Mr. McCain was asked in one of the debates how he would deal with the economic crisis, he answered: ''Well, the first thing we have to do is get spending under control.''
 If Barack Obama becomes president, he won't have the same knee-jerk opposition to spending. But he will face a chorus of inside-the-Beltway types telling him that he has to be responsible, that the big deficits the government will run next year if it does the right thing are unacceptable.
 He should ignore that chorus. The responsible thing, right now, is to give the economy the help it needs. Now is not the time to worry about the deficit.

HEADLINE: Dow Gains 401 Points In Day of Wild Swings

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM; Vikas Bajaj, David Jolly and Sharon Otterman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
For once, fear fled the markets at 3 p.m. 
 An hour that has become known for its heartbreaking declines proved a boon on Thursday, as stocks gained 400 points in the final minutes, despite a rash of weak reports on the health of the economy. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average, which had swung wildly throughout the day, mounted its recovery on shares of energy companies and consumer favorites like McDonald's. The index finished up 401.35 points at 8,979.26, but not before lurching more than 800 points up and down the chart. 
 For much of the day, investors seemed at a loss. Promising signs on the inflation front -- including a tame Consumer Price Index and a $4.69 drop in the price of oil -- were undermined by weak reports on the manufacturing industry. At 9:50 a.m., the Dow was up 150 points; by 11, it was down 300. The rest of the afternoon was a bumpy ride in and out of negative territory, until the last hour brought a critical mass of buyers back into the market.
 The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.3 percent and the Nasdaq gained about 5.5 percent as technology shares staged a rebound from this week's heavy losses.
 ''These days, 400 points -- at least over the last couple of weeks -- is par for the course,'' said Richard Sparks, an analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research. ''I think that the only thing that might bring stability is time.''
 In the credit markets, investors were treated to mixed signals. Yields on Treasury bonds rose, a sign that investors were willing to move out of the ultra-safe government bills. Banks charged each other slightly less for overnight loans. And California successfully sold $5 billion in municipal bonds, placating fears that the state would face a fiscal crisis because of a lack of buyers.
 But lending of commercial paper -- short-term financing that many businesses depend on to fund their daily operations -- shrank in the week ended Wednesday, declining by 2.6 percent from a week earlier to its lowest level since the summer of 2005. That means that many banks and businesses remain reluctant to lend, even for very short amounts of time, starving some businesses of critical cash.
 The recent chaos has also kept investors skittish about the markets. For the week ended Wednesday, investors withdrew $9.9 billion, or 0.5 percent of assets, from stock-based mutual funds. Taxable bond funds paid out redemptions of $12.6 billion, or 1.8 percent, according to AMG Data Services. There were also significant outflows from municipal bond funds, which lost $2.3 billion, or 0.9 percent.
 Until the late-day rally, investors had focused on troubling signs about the economy, which many fear is headed toward or already embroiled in the deepest recession in years. While the number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits last week was slightly lower than expected, two Federal Reserve reports hinted at trouble in the manufacturing sector. 
 One showed that production at the nation's factories dropped by 2.8 percent in September, largely because of the two gulf hurricanes. That drop, the biggest since 1974, was far worse than economists had expected, and it came a day after the Commerce Department said that retail sales shrank last month during the back-to-school shopping season, usually the second-strongest time of year behind of the December holidays. Another showed factories in the Philadelphia area had the worst month for business in 18 years. The Philadelphia Fed index dropped to a minus 37.5 reading in October from September's 3.8 reading.
 Stock charts turned vertical after the report was released at 10 a.m., and the Dow plunged nearly 4 percent, before its afternoon surge.
 ''The realization is dawning on people that we are heading into a recession, and it may not be the short and shallow recession that we had hoped for,'' said Brian Gendreau, an investment strategist at ING Investment Management. ''The focus has shifted from the financial crisis to the real economy, but the news is not good there either.''
 Still, while the economy may be sputtering, the threat of stagflation -- a condition of inflation during a period of economic stagnation that concerned some economists just weeks ago -- appears to have receded.
 Prices paid for common consumer products did not budge in September, the Labor Department said on Thursday, keeping in line with a similar slowdown in August. The Consumer Price Index, considered an important gauge of inflation, was unchanged last month, driven down by cheaper gasoline, automobiles, and clothing.
 Outside of energy and food products, the core index rose 0.1 percent. Foods and beverages cost more, as did medical care. In the last 12 months, consumer prices grew 4.9 percent, less than the 5.4 percent annual rate recorded in August. The core index rose 2.5 percent in the last year.
 The report comes a day after the government said that prices paid by businesses and wholesalers declined in August. The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, also said Wednesday that inflation pressures would recede in the fall as the economy slowed further. The encouraging inflation data may make it easier for Fed policy makers to lower interest rates when the central bank meets at the end of the month.
 In Europe, the major stock indexes in London, Paris and Frankfurt all ended more than 5 percent lower as investors reacted to Wednesday's 733-point drop in the Dow.
 Asian stocks rose on Friday morning. Japan's Nikkei 225 Stock Average climbed 1.5 percent to 8,588.11, while the broader Topix index rose 20.65, or 2.4 percent, to 885.17.
 Oil prices dropped $4.69 to settle at $69.85 a barrel. Gold prices dropped more than $42 to $804.60 a Troy ounce. 
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury bill fell 3/32, to 100 11/32, and the yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was 3.96 percent, up from 3.95 percent late Wednesday. 
 Following are the results of Thursday's Treasury auction of 191-day and 247-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: The Rays Show the Way for African-American Players

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN. 
E-mail: wcr@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Boston 

 BODY:
 Until Tampa Bay's meltdown Thursday, the Rays' spectacular postseason performance was distinguished by bold moves, free swinging and the uninhibited exuberance of youth. 
 Now, after watching the defending champion Red Sox overcome a 7-0 deficit, Tampa Bay will have to wait until Saturday for its potential first -- a trip to the World Series -- as the American League Championship Series moves to Florida for Game 6 and, possibly, 7.
 File the outcome under the category of lessons learned. 
 So far, the most impressive part of Tampa Bay's success in the playoffs has been the play of its young players, a group that will be with the team for seasons to come.
 The Rays also have a core of talented young African-American players -- outfielders B. J. Upton and Carl Crawford, and pitcher David Price -- whose presence raises the hopeful prospect of a renaissance of black players in major league baseball. 
 How did Crawford, 27; Price, 23; and Upton, 24, avoid the basketball-football magnet? The answers underline economic realities and cultural complexities that go into making choices.
 Crawford said he didn't really have a choice. ''I had a scholarship to play football,'' he said before the game Thursday. He was headed to Nebraska. ''The baseball draft was in June. I ended up getting drafted.
 ''I'm from a poor area. When baseball came with a contract, basically that was it. It was the money that changed my mind. Baseball kind of chose me, I didn't really choose baseball.''
 Crawford, who is from Houston, said the key to sustaining his early interest in baseball was playing in predominately black youth leagues from ages 9 to 14. The league was well organized, and the equipment was furnished free of charge. But the key was growing in an environment in which baseball was a natural and daily part of the community's cultural life.
 ''I figure if they did more stuff like that, it would be easy because that's all we knew growing up,'' Crawford said. ''If we didn't play baseball, it was the end of the world.''
 Crawford said baseball's problem in retaining African-American players came after youth baseball.
 ''It gets kind of tough when you get to high school -- it seems like, that's where all the black kids get weeded out,'' Crawford said. ''It seems like they don't want black kids to play in high school, like they do everything to try to run them off the field.''
 Price, a first-round pick in 2007, was raised in Nashville and earned a scholarship to Vanderbilt. He was pulled into baseball by the Atlanta Braves and David Justice. ''He was a superstar, everybody liked David Justice and he was black, so that's how it all started,'' Price said.
 Like Crawford, Price played in an all-black youth league, and his coaches were African-Americans as well. Price's high school experience was different from Crawford's, and far more enjoyable. 
 The school was mostly white, ''though not by much,'' he said. Baseball was always Price's focus, and he was nurtured in his pursuit to reach the majors. 
 In the absence of a thriving, organized baseball presence in African-American communities, high-profile players must be used as aggressive recruiters.
 ''You have to just sit down and have talks,'' Price said. ''Kind of spread the word. Right now I don't think baseball is deemed as cool as basketball and football to young black athletes. But we've got guys over here making more money than a lot of football and basketball players will ever make. That's kind of slid under the rug, but I think it's something that will change in a couple years.''
 Upton has blossomed in the A.L.C.S. On Thursday, with a three-hit performance against Boston, Upton became the seventh player in A.L.C.S. history to drive in 10 runs.
 Upton was raised in a predominantly white area in Norfolk, Va., where baseball was ubiquitous. ''Based on my location and where I lived, baseball was more accessible,'' he said. ''My dad grew up on baseball, so it was always baseball for me.''
 Upton said he thought that the Rays' success -- and his own -- might help baseball's popularity among young African-American athletes. ''You definitely hope it turns heads,'' Upton said, referring to his success in the postseason. ''At the same time, we have to reach out to the inner-city kids and help them see us more. They always see the football and the basketball. You have to be more hands-on and do as much as you can to try to lure them into playing baseball.'' 
 Upton, his brother and Ryan Zimmerman, the Washington Nationals third baseman, are building a baseball-only workout facility in Norfolk, designed for young athletes who may not be able to afford baseball camps. 
 The secret to recruiting more African-Americans to the game is to persuade young people and their parents that baseball is the better long-term route. Careers last longer, the wear and tear on the body is less severe, the compensation is exceptional and the union is stronger than those in football or basketball.
 ''I tell kids back home, 'If y'all only knew,' '' Crawford said. ''This is the big secret they don't want anybody to know. This is the sport that you want to play.''
 Thanks to Tampa Bay and especially to Crawford, Upton and Price, baseball may be a secret no longer.

 BATISTE MADALENA AND THE CINEMA OF THE 1920S (Monday and Wednesday) Hired in 1924 to create custom posters for the Eastman Theater in Rochester, Batiste Madalena applied his talents to more than 1,400 original works before he left Eastman's employ in 1928. Approximately 250 of his elegant Art Nouveau creations survive, and 53 of them will be on display in the lobby galleries of the Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters at the Museum of Modern Art, through April 6. A series of films for which Madalena designed posters runs concurrently, beginning on Monday with D. W. Griffith's 1925 ''Sally of the Sawdust,'' starring W. C. Fields, and Mauritz Stiller's 1927 ''Hotel Imperial,'' with Pola Negri. The film program continues through March 14. Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $10. 
 (Dave Kehr)'A TIME FOR BURNING' (Monday) From the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences film archive, a new print of William C. Jersey's Oscar-nominated 1967 cinema-verite documentary. The subject is the Rev. L. William Youngdahl, a white Lutheran minister in Omaha, Neb., who bravely tries to establish ties with a black Lutheran congregation on the other side of town. But this is no Hollywood heart-warmer: things do not go as planned. Elvis Mitchell, a former film critic for The New York Times, is scheduled to lead a post-screening discussion with Mr. Jersey and the former Nebraska State Democratic Senator Ernie Chambers, who was a young Omaha barber and budding community leader when he appeared in Mr. Jersey's film.

 TRUTH OR DARE: THE FILMS OF ANDRZEJ WAJDA (Friday through Thursday) Born in 1926, Andrzej Wajda has become Poland's semi-official national filmmaker, a witness to his country's troubled 20th-century history, from the German occupation (depicted in the brilliant mid-'50s trilogy that introduced him to the world: ''A Generation,'' ''Kanal'' and ''Ashes and Diamonds'') to the spread of the Solidarity movement (in ''Man of Marble'' and ''Man of Iron'') and the collapse of Polish Communism. This retrospective, said to be the most complete to be assembled in the United States, is sponsored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Polish Cultural Institute of New York, and will go on a national tour after its Lincoln Center engagement. More than 30 films and television productions are included, ranging from famous works like ''Everything for Sale'' -- Mr. Wajda's 1969 tribute to the actor Zbigniew Cybulski, who starred in his first films and died in a train accident in 1967 -- to intriguing obscurities like his 1972 ''Pilate and Others,'' an adaptation of the biblical chapters of Mikhail Bulgakov's ''Master and Margarita,'' made for West German television. Mr. Wajda will be present to introduce Friday's 7:30 p.m. screening of the 1975 nationalist epic ''The Promised Land,'' and will be joined by the actress Elzbieta Czyzewska to present ''Everything for Sale'' on Saturday at 6:30 p.m. Walter Reade Theater, 165 West 65th Street, Lincoln Center, (212) 975-5600, filmlinc.org; $11.

 MOVIES
 Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies.
 'AN AMERICAN CAROL' (PG-13, 1:23) Michael Moore and the blame-America-first set are satirized, sort of, in this lazy, mean-spirited movie by David Zucker. (Nathan Lee)
 'APPALOOSA' (R, 1:47) Ed Harris, who directed, stars with Viggo Mortensen, Renee Zellweger and Jeremy Irons in this sly, relaxed western, which is less concerned with gunfighting and law and order than with jealousy, friendship and the perils of frontier romance. It's a somber shoot-em-up with the mischievous soul of a sex comedy. (A. O. Scott) 
 'BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA' (PG, 1:25) As multimillion-dollar frivolities about the pets of the ruling class go, ''Beverly Hills Chihuahua'' is reasonably diverting. As one released in the middle of an economic meltdown, its mere existence feels utterly insane. (Lee)
 'BLINDNESS' (R, 2:01) An outbreak of metaphor threatens civilization. A fine group of actors -- especially Julianne Moore and Mark Ruffalo as a doctor and his wife -- does its best to save this adaptation of Jose Saramago's overrated book from its dull, earnest allegorical intentions. (Scott)
 'BODY OF LIES' (R, 2:06) Ridley Scott's new movie raises a potentially disturbing question. If terrorism has become boring, does that mean that the terrorists have won? Or, conversely, is the grinding tedium of this film good news for our side, evidence of the awesome might of Western popular culture, which can turn even the most bloodthirsty real-world villains into fodder for contrived and lifeless action thrillers? (Scott)
 'BURN AFTER READING' (R, 1:36) A predictably self-amused comedy from Joel and Ethan Coen with a tricky plot, visual style, er, to burn, but so little heart as to warrant a Jarvik 8. With George Clooney, Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt. 
 (Manohla Dargis)
 'CHOKE' (R, 1:32) Marinated in the aesthetic of cooler-than-thou irony and hip transgression, this absurdist comedy, adapted from a novel by the ''Fight Club'' author Chuck Palahniuk, is clever but not laugh-out-loud funny, except for a couple of hilarious riffs. (Stephen Holden) 
 'CHRISTMAS ON MARS' (No rating, 1:25) The Oklahoma band the Flaming Lips are the stars of this dreamy movie, which loosely concerns a remote, imperiled Red Planet outpost on Christmas Eve. The lead singer, Wayne Coyne, who directed, plays a horned alien who arrives in a glowing orb and dons a Santa suit. But forget plot; it's all about the black-and-white images, bursts of psychedelia and homemade-looking but sometimes lyrical effects. And the great soundtrack. (Andy Webster)
 'CITY OF EMBER' (PG, 1:35) In this science-fiction juvenilia, adapted from Jeanne DePrau's children's novel, two fresh-faced adolescents discover the path to freedom from a dying subterranean city whose power source is breaking down. (Holden) 'THE DARK KNIGHT' (PG-13, 2:32) Pitched at the divide between poetry and entertainment, Christopher Nolan's follow-up to ''Batman Begins'' goes darker and deeper than any Hollywood movie of its comic-book kind. With Christian Bale as the big bat and a spellbinding Heath Ledger as the smiler with the knives. 
 (Dargis)
 'THE DUCHESS' (PG-13, 1:45) An overstuffed, underbaked portrait of the cosseted, tightly corseted late-18th-century life of Georgiana Spencer, the Duchess of Devonshire. Saul Dibbs directs, Keira Knightley stars, and Ralph Fiennes acts. 
 (Dargis)
 'EAGLE EYE' (PG-13, 1:58) Shia LaBoeuf and Michelle Monaghan on the run from something. From what? A ticked-off government computer, apparently. Did I spoil it? Sorry. I mean, you're welcome. (Scott)'ELEGY' (R, 1:48) Ben Kingsley and a radiant Penelope Cruz star in Isabel Coixet's polite take on Philip Roth's insistently impolite short novel ''The Dying Animal.'' (Dargis)
 'THE EXPRESS' (PG, 2:09) Like ''GloryRoad,'' ''The Great Debate'' and numerous similar movies, ''The Express'' packages a real-life story of athletic triumph and social progress into an accessible, rousing melodrama that is no less potent for being almost entirely predictable. (Scott)
 'FIREPROOF' (PG, 2:02) In this film aimed at the Christian market, Kirk Cameron plays a firefighter who tries to save his marriage by embarking on a faith-based regimen called the Love Dare, but his wife (Erin Bethea) seems unresponsive. It's a much better attempt to merge storytelling with faith than is usual for the genre, and the amateur cast is surprisingly good. (Neil Genzlinger)
 'FLASH OF GENIUS' (PG-13, 2:00) In this doggedly workmanlike and passionless variation on the lone crusader doing battle with the big, bad establishment, Greg Kinnear plays the real-life inventor of the intermittent windshield wiper who sued Ford for stealing his patent. (Holden)'FLY ME TO THE MOON' (G, 1:30) Three flies stow away on Apollo 11 in this animated feature created start to finish expressly for 3-D. But not, alas, for pleasure or art. (Lee)
 'FROZEN RIVER' (R, 1:37) Venturing deep into the trenches where hard-working Americans struggle to put food on the table, Courtney Hunt's powerful, somber film evokes a perfect storm of present-day economic and social woes. Playing an impoverished mother of two who smuggles illegal aliens across the Canadian border, Melissa Leo gives an awards-worthy performance. 
 (Holden) 'GHOST TOWN' (PG-13, 1:43) A misanthropic dentist (Ricky Gervais), a roguish ghost (Tea Leoni) and a zany Egyptologist (Greg Kinnear): as this unlikely threesome scamper around Manhattan in this fluffy latter-day hybrid of ''Topper'' and ''Blithe Spirit,'' they resurrect the spirits of classic '30s screwball characters in Woody Allen territory. (Holden)
 'HAPPY-GO-LUCKY' (R, 1:58) Happiness is a complicated, difficult matter, and for the bopping bloom at the center of Mike Leigh's generous, expansive new film -- a gurgling stream of giggles, laughs and words played by a glorious Sally Hawkins -- it's also a question of faith. 
 (Dargis)
 'IGOR' (PG, 1:26) An animated twist on the Frankenstein story that never sparks to life, ''Igor'' inhabits a cloud-covered kingdom where evil scientists are rewarded for diabolical inventions. John Cusack competently voices the hunchbacked servant who assembles a female monster, but kiddies will be undiverted by the humdrum animation and a palette that mirrors the film's moral and meteorological gloom. (Jeannette Catsoulis)
 'I SERVED THE KING OF ENGLAND' (R, 1:58, in Czech) There is hardly a moment in this picaresque slapstick epic, directed by Jiri Menzel (''Closely Watched Trains'') and set mainly in 1930s and '40s Czechoslovakia that you are not aware that its absurdist view of the human condition was shaped by traumatic 20th-century events. (Holden)
 'LAKEVIEW TERRACE' (PG-13, 1:46) In this silly exercise in mock provocation, Samuel L. Jackson plays a Los Angeles police officer who terrorizes his new neighbors, a perfectly nice interracial couple played by Patrick Wilson and Kerry Washington. (Scott)
 'MAN ON WIRE' (PG-13, 1:34) Philippe Petit's 1974 tightrope walk between the towers of the World Trade Center might have seemed, at the time, like a crazy stunt, but James Marsh's beautiful documentary understands it as a work of art. (Scott)
 'MIRACLE AT ST. ANNA' (PG-13, 2:40) Spike Lee's World War II drama about a squad of African-American soldiers fighting in Italy is overlong and ungainly, but it has enough moments of warmth and conviction to make it a worthy addition to the combat genre. (Scott) 'NICK & NORAH'S INFINITE PLAYLIST' (PG-13, 1:30) Teenagers falling in love on the tame night streets of Manhattan. As thin as an iPod Nano and as sweetly self-conscious as a Facebook page, but not without charm. (Scott)
 'NIGHTS IN RODANTHE' (PG-13, 1:37) Richard Gere and Diane Lane fumble like teenagers and mouth some pitiful, platitudinous, risible dialogue in a soggy romance directed by George C. Wolfe and based on a Nicholas Sparks book. (Dargis)
 'QUARANTINE' (R, 1:26) The recent resurgence of the pseudo-documentary horror movie continues with this tale of a television news team trapped in an urban apartment building whose residents are harboring a mysterious infection. Cleverly working his claustrophobic setting (and the adapted script from the Spanish movie ''[REC]''), the director, John Erick Dowdle, keeps the action tight and the injuries nasty. (Catsoulis)
 'RACHEL GETTING MARRIED' (R, 1:54) Anne Hathaway plays Kym, furloughed from rehab to attend her sister Rachel's wedding. The director, Jonathan Demme, working from a script by Jenny Lumet, takes a fairly conventional family-therapy drama and packs it with exuberant vitality. There is ample sorrow and recrimination at this party, but nonetheless you'll be sorry when it ends. (Scott)
 'RELIGULOUS' (R, 1:41) The comedian and outspoken religious nonbeliever Bill Maher travels the world interviewing Christians, Jews and Muslims about their beliefs, which he views as dangerous nonsense.
 (Holden)
 'RIGHTEOUS KILL' (R, 1:40) Robert De Niro and Al Pacino go macho-a-macho in a thrill-free B-movie thriller (more like C-minus) that probably sounded like a grand idea when their handlers whispered it in their ears. Jon Avnet directed. (Dargis)
 'ROCKNROLLA' (R, 1:57) In his latest, the director Guy Ritchie pumps up the volume, tilts the camera, flexes the muscle, struts the stuff for some bang bang, blah blah. (Dargis)
 'A SECRET' (No rating, 1:45, in French) Claude Miller's adaptation of Philippe Grimbert's autobiographical novel is a subtle and moving exploration of intimacy and desire in a French Jewish family before and after World War II. (Scott)
 'TALENTO DE BARRIO' (R, 1:47, in Spanish and English) Daddy Yankee, the reggaeton star, tries acting here, and looks as if he might have some ability in that department, but the story is so cliched that it's hard to tell. He plays a gangster who rules a ratty slum in Puerto Rico but -- guess what? -- he aspires to be a performer. Will his drug-dealing past drag him down, or can he escape the bad life? Original it ain't. 
 (Genzlinger) 'TELL NO ONE' (No rating, 2:05, in French) In the shortcut language of a movie pitch, Guillaume Canet's delicious contemporary thriller is ''Vertigo'' meets ''The Fugitive'' by way of ''The Big Sleep.'' This French adaptation of Harlan Coben's 2001 best seller (same name) is the kind of conspiracy-minded mystery almost no one seems capable of creating anymore, except David Lynch in his surreal way. Beautifully written and acted, it is a labyrinth in which to get deliriously lost. (Holden)
 'TROPIC THUNDER' (R, 1:47) A flashy, nasty, on-and-off funny and assaultive sendup of the film industry, directed by Ben Stiller, who stars alongside Robert Downey Jr. (in blackface) and Jack Black (in itty- bitty bikini underwear). (Dargis) 'TROUBLE THE WATER' (No rating, 1:33) While making this superb documentary about that natural and unnatural disaster, Hurricane Katrina, the filmmakers Carl Deal and Tia Lessin hit the jackpot when they meet two New Orleans survivors, Kimberly and Scott Roberts, who rode out the storm with a video camera. (Dargis) 
 'TYLER PERRY'S THE FAMILY THAT PREYS' (PG-13, 1:51) The suds that cascade through Tyler Perry melodrama more than equal the cubic footage from nighttime soaps like ''Dallas,'' ''Dynasty'' and their offspring. (Holden)
 'VICKY CRISTINA BARCELONA' (PG-13, 1:36) A rueful comedy from Woody Allen about two young American women (Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall) who, during a summertime European idyll, savor numerous Continental delicacies, some provided by the equally alluring Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz. (Dargis)
 'WALL-E' (G, 1:37) The latest Pixar movie is many things: a silent comedy, a robot love story, a cautionary science fiction parable. Also a masterpiece. (Scott) 'WILD COMBINATION: A PORTRAIT OF ARTHUR RUSSELL' (No rating, 1:10) This exquisite documentary by Matt Wolf pays homage to the soulful sounds of Arthur Russell, an extravagantly gifted musician who died of AIDS in 1992. (Lee)
 'THE WOMEN' (PG-13, 1:54) ''What is this, some '30s movie?'' a character asks in this misbegotten remake of George Cukor's feline look at female friendship and rivalry. If only. (Scott)

 DETAILS When a place develops as quickly as Costa Rica has recently, residents often fear that a local identity could be lost. Sure, large hotel chains may invigorate local economies with their megaresorts, but will the indigenous culture fade as beachfront towers rise? One development seeks to balance these concerns is Alegria, in the town of Flamingo on the north Pacific coast. Created by a native Costa Rican, Roberto Facio, who in the mid '80s served as the country's minister to Canada, the 19-acre project is centered on a nonprofit center dedicated to Costa Rica's artistic and cultural heritage. There are initial plans for 200 two- and three-bedroom condominiums in four eight-story buildings, with 64 two- and three-bedroom town houses to be added in the future. The residences are sold in whole ownership, and a rental program is planned. The arts center, which will be in a central plaza with restaurants and a market selling local produce and seafood, will consist of a gallery with a permanent collection of work by Costa Rican artists and studios for artists-in-residence. There will also be a private clubhouse with the full-service spa, a swimming pool, another restaurant and a fitness center with yoga and pilates studios. Three beaches are within walking distance of the site, and a nearby marina is expected to be overhauled. The international airport in Liberia is about an hour's drive away.

 DETAILS For some prospective second-home buyers, there's nothing better than a simple homesite. Starting with that blank canvas, buyers can create a dream home step by step, tailoring it to meet every need. Others, however, are put off by the amount of work that comes with building a home independently. Colorado Mountain Estates, a new development in a north-central Colorado golf community called the Fairways at Pole Creek, aims to simplify the process by offering buyers homesites and a selection of ready-to-build house designs bundled together. The 40 sites, which cover two acres each, are spread around the development surrounding the 27 holes of the public golf course, designed by Gary Player and Dennis Griffiths. There are four 3,600-square-foot designs to choose from, each with four bedrooms, decks, multiple fireplaces, vaulted ceilings and custom options like extra space for guestrooms or media rooms. The new clubhouse will have a lounge and restaurant. The Winter Park ski resort, with more than 3,000 acres of terrain, is about 10 minutes away. The Denver airport is about two hours east.

HEADLINE: In a Downturn, College Strains Family Budgets

BYLINE: By JONATHAN D. GLATER

 BODY:
In difficult dinner-table conversations, college students and their parents are revisiting how to pay tuition as personal finances weaken and lenders get tough.
Diana and Ronnie Jacobs, of Salem, Ind., thought their family had a workable plan for college for her twin sons, using a combination of savings, income, scholarship aid and a relatively modest amount of borrowing. Then her husband lost his job at Colgate-Palmolive.
''It just seems like it's really hard, because it is,'' Ms. Jacobs, an information technology specialist, said of her financial situation. ''I have two kids in college and I want to say 'come home,' but at the same time I want to provide them with a good education.''
The Jacobs family may be a harbinger of what is to come. Ms. Jacobs pressed the schools' financial offices for several thousand dollars more for each son's final year of college, and each son increased his borrowing to the maximum amount through the federal loan program. So they at least will be able to finish at their respective colleges. 
With the unemployment rate rising and a recession mentality gripping the country, financial aid administrators say they expect many more calls like the one from Ms. Jacobs. More families are applying for federal aid, and a recent survey found that an increasing portion of families expected to need student loans. College administrators worry that as fresh cracks appear in family finances, they will not have enough aid money to go around, given that their own endowment returns are disappointing, states are making cutbacks and fund-raising will become more difficult.
''We are looking ahead and trying to be prepared for what might be coming,'' said Jon Riester, associate dean of financial assistance at Hanover College, a private institution with about 1,000 undergraduates, including Justin Keeton, one of Ms. Jacobs's sons. ''We're looking internally at our own budgets to see what we may be able to do in terms of providing additional assistance to students under various situations.''
The concern is widespread, even though college officials say it's too soon to quantify how many students will face a shortfall. Even at wealthy institutions, financial aid administrators have begun weighing contingency plans. ''Part of the conversation that's going on now in many institutions is, do we want to put a dollar figure on how much we are willing to extend ourselves,'' said L. Katharine Harrington, dean of admission and financial aid at the University of Southern California.
Ms. Harrington said she opposed setting a limit on aid, but added that the university's pockets were not bottomless. ''If we start seeing massive layoffs,'' she added, ''we may be in for a real bumpy ride.''
The credit crisis has made it harder for students and their parents to borrow, even as their needs grow and their savings accounts dwindle. In plenty of cases, students who had been borrowing on their own have had to ask parents -- and in some cases, other relatives and friends -- to help cover tuition or to cosign loans, both aid officials and lenders say.
Officials at most four-year colleges say that they have not seen rampant problems so far, because students have found alternatives. The financing for the fall semester was mostly in place many months ago, before the severity of the credit crisis and the economic downturn became apparent.
Others wonder privately whether there will a rebellion by parents about paying so much for education if the country's economic distress is prolonged. A survey of nearly 3,000 parents by Fidelity Investments released earlier this month found that 62 percent of parents planned to use student loans to help finance expenses, up from 53 percent last year.
Ms. Jacobs said that with a family income of more than $100,000 a year, they had been counting on some loans to help pay for college for her 21-year-old sons, Justin and Jacob Keeton. Tuition, room and board add up to just over $32,000 at Hanover College in Hanover, Ind., which Justin attends, and nearly $29,500 at Franklin College, in Franklin, Ind., which Jacob attends.
Then, in December, Colgate-Palmolive closed its Jeffersonville plant, where her husband worked.
''I said, 'This year the loans are going to have to be in your name, I'm not going to be able to pick up as much as I have before,' '' Ms. Jacobs recalled. ''They said they would be willing to put the student loans in their names and continue on. We all came to that consensus, but I hate it because I hate for them to come out of school with $20,000 in student loans,'' Ms. Jacobs added. ''To me that is so much money.''
She also called the two colleges, and each contributed about $3,000 more in aid, she said.
Financial aid administrators have been scrambling in a rapidly changing market, as many companies have decided that student loans are just not profitable enough. Many student loan providers, citing reduced profit margins and greater difficulty selling loans, have stopped making federally guaranteed loans, private loans or both.
Federal loans account for about three-quarters of student borrowing, and the government has assured that money will flow uninterrupted by agreeing to buy those loans, even if fewer companies are in the business. Federal loan volume is likely to grow this year; the number of applications for federal aid so far this year has risen to 13.5 million, up nearly 10 percent from 12.3 million a year earlier.
Private lending, which helps families plug the gap between federal aid and the total cost of attendance, has been the fastest-growing segment over the last decade but has been undergoing rapid changes. Some of the biggest lenders, like Sallie Mae, have tightened their credit standards and raised their interest rates yet again in recent weeks. ''The current financial markets provide no other choice,'' Sallie Mae wrote to colleges last week. ''When conditions improve, we hope to relax our underwriting criteria and serve more students.''
Tim Ranzetta, the founder of Student Lending Analytics, posted the lender's letter on his blog, where he called it ''extremely bad news for students.''
Michaela Rice, now a sophomore at Plymouth State University, is one of the students who had to redesign her borrowing after she learned in the spring that a student loan she had taken out with her father as cosigner would evaporate because the lender was getting out of that business. A financial aid specialist at Plymouth State, which has about 4,300 undergraduates in Plymouth, N.H., suggested the family switch to federal parent loans.
That led Ms. Rice to ask her mother, who is divorced from her father, to take on $17,000 in debt. The new loan, called a Parent Plus loan, has a more flexible repayment options and a fixed 8.5 percent interest rate. But it also puts her mother at risk if Ms. Rice does not earn enough as a teacher to cover repayments.
''We haven't really sat down and talked about how am I going to pay for it,'' said Ms. Rice, 19. ''My senior year we'll probably sit down.''The subject touched on other sensitive issues -- in this case, the question of how Ms. Rice's biological father might continue to help pay for her college education and what her stepfather's role should be.
Ms. Rice's mother, Judy Krahulec, remarried to an American Airlines pilot who already had children of his own, and she did not want to saddle him with debt for children who were not his. She and Ms. Rice hesitated over the parent loan.''If I sign papers, who am I really indebting? My husband,'' Ms. Krahulec said. ''That's who I'm indebting. It's not my loan, it's his.''
''It would be in my mom's name,'' said Ms. Rice, who said she would repay her mother, ''but it's my stepdad's money if anything went wrong.''
Still, she was lucky, because not all students' parents qualify for Plus loans. To satisfy companies that make private loans, more students have had to find cosigners.
Kiara S. Holiday, a sophomore this year at High Point University in High Point, N.C., learned just weeks before classes were to start that her mother had not qualified for a Plus loan.
''It threw me for a loop,'' said Ms. Holiday, who is 19. ''Person after person, they just denied, like my mother, my aunts.''
Ms. Holiday said she investigated the options. But even taking advantage of larger maximum federal Stafford loan amounts available to students whose parents are denied Plus loans, she did not have enough to cover about $31,000 in tuition, room and board at High Point.
So she called her great-grandmother, an octogenarian in Boston. Ms. Holiday, who wants to go to medical school and become an immunologist in a laboratory, said that despite the poor economy, she was not worried about being able to pay her debts after graduation.
''I'm pretty sure something will work out for me,'' Ms. Holiday said.

HEADLINE: Man Who Helped Set the Stage for Nobel-Winning Work Has Left Science

BYLINE: By KENNETH CHANG

 BODY:
In a couple of months, Roger Y. Tsien and Martin Chalfie will head to Oslo to collect the Nobel Prize in Chemistry and $450,000 in prize money each in recognition of their development of a revolutionary technique that lights up the inner workings of living cells.
 Meanwhile, the scientist who provided the essential piece that made Dr. Tsien's and Dr. Chalfie's work possible -- a jellyfish gene that produces a fluorescent protein -- is out of science. 
 Douglas C. Prasher, who conducted his research on the Aequorea victoria jellyfish while at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts in the early 1990's, now drives a courtesy van for a car dealer in Huntsville, Ala., earning $10 an hour.
 He said he is not bitter or jealous of this year's winning chemistry Nobelists: Dr. Tsien of the University of California, San Diego, Dr. Chalfie of Columbia and Osamu Shimomura, the original discoverer of the jellyfish protein in 1961.
 Still, if events had unfolded slightly differently, Dr. Prasher, 57, might have been the one in the spotlight last week.
 Trained as a biochemist, Dr. Prasher was interested in the chemistry of how certain animals are able to glow. In the late 1980s, he applied to the National Institutes of Health for a five-year grant to track down the fluorescent protein gene. 
 Dr. Prasher said that his proposal included speculation on how the fluorescent protein might be used as a beacon to light up structures in cells. ''That would have certainly been part of my research program,'' Dr. Prasher said. ''I knew it could serve as a genetic marker and it would be really, really useful, which it has turned out to be.''
 Dr. Prasher's application was turned down.
 A parallel proposal to the American Cancer Society succeeded, but that grant provided only two years of financing. That gave Dr. Prasher enough time to fish out thousands of jellyfish out of waters off Friday Harbor, Wash. and to successfully isolate the gene.
 However, by then, Dr. Prasher had decided that Woods Hole was not the work place for him. Instead of putting himself through the trials of the tenure process -- he thought he would be turned down, anyway -- he set out for a new job and wound down his jellyfish research.
 Dr. Chalfie and Dr. Tsien independently contacted Dr. Prasher asking about the jellyfish gene. Dr. Prasher generously shared the gene with both of them.
 Dr. Prasher then worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture, first on Cape Cod and later in Beltsville, Md., developing methods for identifying pests and other insects. Again, Dr. Prasher was not happy, the beginning of bouts of depression. ''I was not happy with management there, so I looked for another position,'' he said.
 The next shift in locale and occupation was Huntsville, where he worked for a NASA subcontractor that was developing mini-chemistry laboratories, which would be needed as health diagnostic tools if astronauts eventually make the trip to Mars.
 That job Dr. Prasher loved. He said his ideal science job would be to manage a group like the one he worked with at NASA's Marshall Spaceflight Center. (His ideal non-science job, he said, would be to run an architectural supply store.)
 But a Mars mission is hypothetical, and at least more than a decade away. NASA eliminated the financing for the project, and Dr. Prasher lost his job. For family reasons, he is staying in Huntsville, which greatly restricts his opportunities. ''The amount of life science done here is very limited,'' he said.
 The depression returned. ''That's been a serious problem off and on, but anyone who doesn't have a job has that problem,'' Dr. Prasher said. ''If they don't, there's a problem with them. Or they're independently wealthy.''
 After a year of unemployment, he started driving the van for Bill Penney Toyota, his job for the last year and a half.
 Then last week, the Nobel in Chemistry was announced, and some media attention turned to Huntsville and Dr. Prasher. He said someone in Chicago who had read about him called him and offered a check. ''That totally freaked me out,'' Dr. Prasher said. ''We actually had a nice conversation.''
 Dr. Prasher also said, perhaps with a bit of surprise even to himself, that he would have been uncomfortable if he had been selected as one of the Nobel winners, nudging aside one of the others. (Each Nobel traditionally is shared by no more than three people.)
 ''There are other people who would have deserved it a whole lot more than me,'' he said, ''They worked their butts off over their entire lives for science and I haven't.''

HEADLINE: UBS Given An Infusion Of Capital

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

DATELINE: PARIS 

 BODY:
Switzerland extended urgent help Thursday to its storied banking industry as the government acknowledged that even the world's biggest wealth needed protection from the tumult gripping the global financial system. 
 Less than a week after Europe and the United States coordinated moves to ease the crisis, the Swiss government said it would take a 9 percent stake in UBS, the financial giant that has been among the hardest hit by losses from American subprime mortgage debt, and provide it with 6 billion Swiss francs ($5.36 billion) in capital. 
 Rebuking UBS for failing to maintain adequate risk controls, regulators also set up a $60 billion fund to absorb troubled assets lingering on its books, a move intended to strengthen its financial and competitive position. 
 Credit Suisse, the country's other banking powerhouse, rebuffed an offer of direct government help and said it would raise $8.75 billion on its own from the Qatar Investment Authority and other private backers to shore up its capital base. 
 Although neither bank is in danger of collapse, the Swiss National Bank, Switzerland's central bank, moved quickly as it became evident that confidence in UBS's core wealth management business was eroding. 
 ''We have time,'' Jean-Pierre Roth, president of the national bank, said, underscoring both the depth of UBS's difficulties, as well as the traditional long-term view Swiss bankers are known for. ''UBS does not have time.''
 For the Swiss, whose usually prudent and discreet banks are as much of an international symbol of the nation as its neutrality, the Matterhorn or Swiss Army knives, the idea of the government having to shore up the financial system is a humiliating comedown.
 ''This operation is highly unusual, both with regard to its scope and the reasons for it,'' Mr. Roth said. ''In carrying it out, we are making a contribution to an essential element of the Swiss financial system at a time when financial markets have been in turmoil for some months now.'' 
 The knowledge that the losses at UBS stem from such un-Swiss habits as reckless borrowing and betting on shaky American mortgages is doubly painful. Many individual Swiss shareholders believe their banks should have stuck to the private wealth business they have long dominated, rather than getting caught up in what they consider the casino-like world of Wall Street.
 ''It's not nice that UBS is getting partly nationalized, and we are not happy that the Swiss government has to take a 9 percent stake,'' Roby Tschopp, managing director of Actares, a Swiss organization that represents shareholders, said. ''But we know this is happening worldwide, and $60 billion is a lot less than the $700 billion Paulson plan in the U.S.,'' he said, referring to financial rescue efforts shaped by the United States Treasury secretary, Henry M. Paulson Jr.
 Mr. Roth emphasized that the move was critical to helping Switzerland ''weather the economic difficulties resulting from the anticipated global economic slowdown in the months ahead.'' The Swiss government also plans to increase protection for depositors from a current guarantee of 30,000 Swiss francs ($22,400), after similar steps were taken elsewhere in Europe. 
 The reputation of UBS as one of the world's most conservative banks was left in tatters after it made an astonishingly large bet on risky mortgage securities that one point reached $80 billion. UBS, which has seen several top executives step down in the last 18 months, has already been forced to write down more than any other bank in the world on that financial roll of the dice. 
 This year, UBS conceded it had fundamentally misread the market for mortgage securities as it took advantage of cheap leverage in Switzerland to load up on what appeared to be low-risk, high-yield mortgage-backed securities flowing from America. It has also acknowledged that its vaunted risk-management system had broken down, a problem the Swiss Banking Commission was quick to note on Thursday. 
 The hangover from risky bets became more apparent as both UBS and Credit Suisse previewed poor third-quarter results on Thursday. UBS earned a slight profit of 296 million francs ($261 million) but disclosed that private depositors had withdrawn 49.3 billion francs ($43.4 billion), much of it during the last turbulent weeks of the quarter. In coming quarters, UBS will be under pressure to stanch that outflow since its private wealth management business has long been considered the company's crown jewel and a profit engine.
 Credit Suisse announced a third-quarter loss of $1.12 billion ($986 million) as a result of heavy write-downs in its investment bank, mostly stemming from problems in the hard-hit structured products and leveraged finance units.
 Mr. Roth, of the Swiss central bank, said it would work with the Federal Reserve on the rescue effort for UBS, securing dollars through a swap agreement for francs, underscoring the global nature of the efforts now under way to stem the crisis. The $40 billion in write-downs taken by the bank since last summer stunned a country closely identified with conservative bankers and prompted the retirement of Marcel Ospel, UBS's longtime chairman, this year.
 On Thursday, his successor, Peter Kurer, thanked the Swiss authorities ''for their willingness to develop a commercial solution under economic terms that will support both the stability of the Swiss financial system and UBS.'' 
 UBS acquired its huge portfolio of toxic mortgage debt in an effort to capture higher yields, assuming wrongly that its high credit ratings would protect it from losses if the American housing marked soured. 
 At the same time, UBS managers were caught off guard by the speed with which liquidity in the market for mortgage-backed securities evaporated, making them impossible to unload. Under the terms of Thursday's agreement, $31 billion worth of American assets will be taken over by the Swiss central bank, much of it in the form of debt linked to subprime and Alt-A mortgages, and securities linked to commercial real estate and student loans. 
 The government will take UBS bonds convertible into a nonvoting stake for the capital injection. 
 ''It was difficult for the Swiss banks to raise more capital, so it's a good deal,'' said Alex Koagne, an analyst with Natixis Securities in Paris.

HEADLINE: Two Generals, Still Maneuvering

BYLINE: By CHARLES McGRATH

 BODY:
''Grant and Lee in War and Peace,'' which opens on Friday at the New-York Historical Society, is a rejiggering of an exhibition mounted last year by the Virginia Historical Society in Richmond, where it was called ''Lee and Grant.'' The flip-flop in billing is partly a nod to local bias and to the fact that Grant is, after all, buried right here in New York, where he was a bit of a substance abuser and lost a fortune on Wall Street -- he was one of us, in other words -- while in Richmond they prefer the white-bearded patriarch who seemingly had no faults at all. But the title switch is also a reflection of the way these two generals, implacable opponents on the battlefield, have been linked by posterity in push-me-pull-you fashion, so that the reputation of one can't go up unless the other's sinks. 
 For most of the last 140 years Lee, or a romanticized version of him, has been on top. This Lee is the tragic and valorous embodiment of the Lost Cause, a mythic South that fought not so much to defend slavery as to protect states' rights and a noble, superior way of life, while Grant becomes a drunken butcher, a slaughterer of his own men and a failed, scandal-plagued president who belongs in the company of Warren G. Harding. 
 The scale had so far tilted that by 1920 or so, when John Leon Gerome Ferris painted his famous depiction of the surrender at Appomattox, ''Let Us Have Peace, 1865'' -- which is in the show -- he put Lee, regal and imposing, bathed in light, in the center of the picture, while a shadowy, supplicant Grant, in muddy boots, approaches from the left. If you didn't know better, you would think Lee had won.
 Only in the last few years have historians tried to address the balance a little -- demolishing the long-cherished notion that Lee was personally opposed to slavery, for example, and arguing that it was he who was reckless about casualties and that overaggressiveness contributed to his defeat. In this light Grant starts to look a little better. Even his drinking has been exaggerated, some biographers now claim. The Historical Society show incorporates some of the latest scholarship pointing to Grant's advanced views on civil rights and Indian policy, and even suggests that the failures of Reconstruction were not his so much as those of the nation, which lacked the political will to follow his lead.
 But ''Grant and Lee'' does not, strictly speaking, weigh the merits of one versus the other; nor is it really a Civil War show. Die-hard buffs and Civil War re-enactors seeking to learn more, say, about campfire cookery or latrine excavation at Manassas will probably be a little disappointed, though there is an extensive display examining the Wilderness campaign of 1864-65. And, as always at the New-York Historical Society, there is a lot of excellent stuff on view, some of it borrowed, some of it from the society's own vast troves. 
 Looking for one of Zachary Taylor's spurs or a shako from the Mexican War? No problem. The New-York Historical Society has everything you need right there in the attic at 170 Central Park West. Also on display are Lee's tiny dancing slippers (he was a compulsive flirt and ladies' man), his sword and revolver (courtesy of the Museum of the Confederacy) and Grant's high-pommeled Mexican saddle. There are some audiovisual presentations, and a computer screen that lets you flip through a sketchbook kept by Capt. Abner Doubleday during the Mexican War, a few years after he supposedly invented baseball. 
 ''Grant and Lee'' tries to take a longer view of the two men, putting them in a context that carries right up to the present. As Louise Mirrer, the president of the Historical Society, said last week, the organization recently did two big shows on slavery and felt that it had to offer something that went beyond the traditional Civil War narrative. So the new show explores larger questions about the origins and growth of the military in the United States and about the proper role of the army in a civilian, democratic society. 
 The exhibition begins at West Point, pointing out that when Grant (Class of 1843) and Lee (Class of 1829) went there it was as much an engineering school, where cadets learned to sketch, paint, survey and draw maps, as it was a proving ground for future soldiers. (There are samples of both men's work, and Grant, though otherwise a dismal, demerit-ridden student, turns out to have been a better artist than Lee, just as he proved to be by far the better writer.)
 And fully a third of the show looks at the Seminole Wars, the crisis of Bleeding Kansas and the Mexican War in ways that are meant to draw parallels with American involvement in Vietnam and in Bosnia and Kosovo, and with current debates over immigration.
 It's a provocative arrangement, especially at the end of the show, where the viewer is encouraged to think about the challenges of Reconstruction in light of American efforts to stabilize and rebuild Iraq. And yet thinking about the army this way, as a tool of policy, risks underplaying the degree to which the Civil War was not just another military engagement, but, as Drew Gilpin Faust has argued in her recent book ''The Republic of Suffering,'' something approaching massacre on an organized scale. 
 This was a conflict that fundamentally changed the nature of the American military, turning it into a bureaucracy dependent on political favor and patronage, and that changed the nature of warfare itself. Slaughter became ruthlessly efficient, as did economic war, and in the brand-new arena of public relations, battles began to be waged of the sort that provoke museum exhibitions a century and a half later.
 Though the exhibition doesn't dwell on the personalities of the two generals, they keep asserting themselves nonetheless. The differences between them are apparent in the very first gallery, where a portrait of Lee, the West Point graduate, commissioned by his wealthy plantation family, hangs next to a reproduction of a little daguerreotype that was all the Grant family of Point Pleasant, Ohio, could afford. 
 Lee, brown-haired and clean-shaven except for a dashing mustache, looks like a Byronic hero, while Grant appears to be squirming under a pair of epaulets the size of scrub mops. Lee's uniform coat, in a case down the hall, is trimly tailored and festooned with gold braid; Grant's, next to it, is made of shapeless black sackcloth and is devoid of decoration. Unlike Lee, Grant never looked the part of a general -- he sometimes seemed uncomfortable in his own skin, let alone in a uniform -- and that he was so good at generalship is something of a miracle. The wall labels play down the extent to which he had been a failure at just about everything else.
 The show suggests that the style of each general was partly shaped by his commanding officer in the Mexican War, in which Lee's mentor was Winfield Scott, Old Fuss and Feathers, while Grant was a protege of Zachary Taylor, Old Rough and Ready, but the viewer senses that the differences were deeper than that.
 In some photographs taken near the end of his life, Lee already looks marmoreal -- a statue of himself -- as if he has become trapped in a myth of his own making, while Grant remained a pragmatist and a self-inventor to the end. In 1884, broke and dying of throat cancer, Grant reluctantly sat down and wrote his autobiography, hoping it would sell well enough to leave his wife a legacy. 
 Fittingly, a copy of his ''Personal Memoirs,'' which became one of the best-selling books of the 19th century, is in a case at the end of the show, though the wall label quotes from Whitman and not from Grant's own prose, which was something new at the time, free of the false piety and flannel-mouthed rhetoric that characterized so much Civil War literature. Grant's book, like its author, was clear, concise, no-nonsense and scrupulously honest, and it's the best exhibit we have of what this war was really like. The only thing he was wrong about was his conviction that it would deter us from ever having another one. 
 ''Grant and Lee in War and Peace'' continues through March 29 at the New-York Historical Society, 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street; (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org.

HEADLINE: Buy American. I Am.

BYLINE: By WARREN E. BUFFETT. 
Warren E. Buffett is the chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, a diversified holding company.

DATELINE: Omaha 

 BODY:
 THE financial world is a mess, both in the United States and abroad. Its problems, moreover, have been leaking into the general economy, and the leaks are now turning into a gusher. In the near term, unemployment will rise, business activity will falter and headlines will continue to be scary.
 So ... I've been buying American stocks. This is my personal account I'm talking about, in which I previously owned nothing but United States government bonds. (This description leaves aside my Berkshire Hathaway holdings, which are all committed to philanthropy.) If prices keep looking attractive, my non-Berkshire net worth will soon be 100 percent in United States equities. 
 Why?
 A simple rule dictates my buying: Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful. And most certainly, fear is now widespread, gripping even seasoned investors. To be sure, investors are right to be wary of highly leveraged entities or businesses in weak competitive positions. But fears regarding the long-term prosperity of the nation's many sound companies make no sense. These businesses will indeed suffer earnings hiccups, as they always have. But most major companies will be setting new profit records 5, 10 and 20 years from now.
 Let me be clear on one point: I can't predict the short-term movements of the stock market. I haven't the faintest idea as to whether stocks will be higher or lower a month -- or a year -- from now. What is likely, however, is that the market will move higher, perhaps substantially so, well before either sentiment or the economy turns up. So if you wait for the robins, spring will be over.
 A little history here: During the Depression, the Dow hit its low, 41, on July 8, 1932. Economic conditions, though, kept deteriorating until Franklin D. Roosevelt took office in March 1933. By that time, the market had already advanced 30 percent. Or think back to the early days of World War II, when things were going badly for the United States in Europe and the Pacific. The market hit bottom in April 1942, well before Allied fortunes turned. Again, in the early 1980s, the time to buy stocks was when inflation raged and the economy was in the tank. In short, bad news is an investor's best friend. It lets you buy a slice of America's future at a marked-down price.
 Over the long term, the stock market news will be good. In the 20th century, the United States endured two world wars and other traumatic and expensive military conflicts; the Depression; a dozen or so recessions and financial panics; oil shocks; a flu epidemic; and the resignation of a disgraced president. Yet the Dow rose from 66 to 11,497. 
 You might think it would have been impossible for an investor to lose money during a century marked by such an extraordinary gain. But some investors did. The hapless ones bought stocks only when they felt comfort in doing so and then proceeded to sell when the headlines made them queasy.
 Today people who hold cash equivalents feel comfortable. They shouldn't. They have opted for a terrible long-term asset, one that pays virtually nothing and is certain to depreciate in value. Indeed, the policies that government will follow in its efforts to alleviate the current crisis will probably prove inflationary and therefore accelerate declines in the real value of cash accounts. 
 Equities will almost certainly outperform cash over the next decade, probably by a substantial degree. Those investors who cling now to cash are betting they can efficiently time their move away from it later. In waiting for the comfort of good news, they are ignoring Wayne Gretzky's advice: ''I skate to where the puck is going to be, not to where it has been.''
 I don't like to opine on the stock market, and again I emphasize that I have no idea what the market will do in the short term. Nevertheless, I'll follow the lead of a restaurant that opened in an empty bank building and then advertised: ''Put your mouth where your money was.'' Today my money and my mouth both say equities.

 IN WAKE OF ECONOMIC CRISIS,
 Climate Change Plans May Suffer
 Fears of a sharp worldwide economic slowdown are threatening a European plan on climate change that leaders hoped would set an example for the rest of the world. At a summit meeting, the heads of state of the European Union said they could no longer afford to slash greenhouse gas emissions as envisioned under a broad agreement. The plan called to cut such emissions, blamed for climate change, by 20 percent, from 1990 levels by the year 2020. PAGE A6
 PROGRESS REPORT IN AFGHANISTAN
 The head of United States Special Operations forces is meeting this week with the senior American commander in Afghanistan, as well as top Special Operations officers there, to assess the mission in Afghanistan. He also went to Pakistan to observe a new American-led training program, senior military officials said. PAGE A14 
 JUDGE OPENS FRANCO-ERA CASES
 The crusading investigative judge Baltasar Garzon opened Spain's first criminal investigation into Franco-era executions and repression with an order to open 19 mass graves, including one believed to contain the remains of the poet Federico Garcia Lorca. The order raised an immediate controversy within Spain. PAGE A8
 MAN KILLED IN WEST BANK CLASH
 Israeli troops shot and killed a Palestinian man during a clash in the West Bank, the third such fatality in three days, according to Palestinian officials. The Israeli Army said all three had been holding or about to hurl firebombs when they were shot. PAGE A14
 ECONOMIC RIPPLE ARRIVES IN INDIA
 Jet Airways, India's largest private carrier, having posted large losses over the past year, announced layoffs of 1,900 crew members, including 800 flight attendants. This was part of India's first taste of pain from a bruising global economic slowdown, although the airline reinstated the workers. Until recently, Indians had been spared the worst of the fallout from the current global financial crisis, but now their stock market has plummeted, and property prices have begun to drop. PAGE A12
 PLEDGE TO REJECT TAINTED DONATIONS
 Prime Minister Sergei Stanishev of Bulgaria pledged to donate any campaign contributions tainted by irregularities to charity, after documents were given to prosecutors indicating that his party took $170,000 from people accused of being part of a criminal network. The network is at the center of a European Union investigation into development-aid fraud that provoked the authorities to cut off $670 million to Bulgaria, the poorest nation in the bloc. PAGE A8

 NATIONAL
 E.P.A. TIGHTENS STANDARDS
 For Airborne Lead Particles
 The Environmental Protection Agency cut the maximum allowable concentrations for airborne lead particles to one-tenth of the previous maximum, the first change in federal lead standards in three decades and one praised by environmentalists. But the cleanup of areas with excessive lead levels is not required for more than eight years. PAGE A15
 INQUIRY INTO COMMUNITY GROUP
 Several F.B.I. offices are reviewing reports of fraudulent voter registrations submitted by the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, or Acorn, a liberal community organizing group that has been under fire from Republicans. But law enforcement officials sought to tamp down speculation that the agency had begun a broader investigation into the group's activities. PAGE A19
 CALIFORNIA AVERTS CASH SHORTAGE
 California has managed to borrow $5 billion in the credit markets, the state treasurer announced, averting a severe cash shortage that could have led to service cuts and layoffs. State officials were rejoicing at a better-than-expected reception to the sale of ''revenue anticipation notes,'' essentially short-term loans to tide the state over until its spring tax collections refill coffers. It initially planned to seek $4 billion. PAGE A17
 RECAPTURING A LANGUAGE
 A history of government efforts to ''Americanize'' Indians has left only about 200 Arapaho speakers, none of them younger than 55. As part of an intensifying effort to save the language, a small tribe, known as the Northern Arapaho, recently opened a school in Wyoming where students will be taught in Arapaho. ''This is a race against the clock, and we're in the 59th minute of the last hour,'' said a consultant hired to help start the school. PAGE A15
 OBITUARIES
 TOM TRESH, 70
 A Yankees shortstop and left fielder, he was the American League's rookie of the year in 1962 and played on three World Series teams. PAGE A22
 JACK NARZ, 85
 A mellow-voiced television host who, though blameless, became ensnared in the quiz-show rigging scandal of the late 1950s, but who made a comeback with a five-year run in front of the big puzzle board on ''Concentration.'' PAGE A22
 NEW YORK
 IN NEW TKTS BOOTH, 
 A New Times Square View
 A new TKTS booth opened in Duffy Square, eight years later and nine times costlier than originally estimated. What the extra time and money bought, besides headaches and heartaches for the project's sponsors and the thousands of patrons who line up for discount theater tickets every day, is nothing less than a new way of seeing the Times Square ''bow tie,'' that dazzling intersection of Broadway and Seventh Avenue from atop the booth's 27 ruby-red glass steps. PAGE A29 
 NO AVERAGE JOE
 Overnight, it seemed, the fawning references in the final presidential debate to ''Joe the Plumber'' had elevated the status of that lowly tradesman. But was the old cliche (plumber as schlub) really true? You can still find ''the chubby guy with the cigar,'' said Gil Perez, a Staten Island plumber who holds a law degree, ''but it's really not like that anymore. Plumbers today are businessmen. Some are metrosexuals. Especially in New York City, they're not what you think.'' PAGE A23 
 SPORTS
 RAYS OUTFIELDER LIFTS TEAM
 And a Group of Young Followers
 Rocco Baldelli, an outfielder for the Tampa Bay Rays, has mitochondrial disease, a mysterious cell disorder that caused him such muscle fatigue this spring that he feared retirement, and worse. He still can't practice normally or play a full nine innings without debilitating exhaustion. But he's become a role model for children with the same disease, and his home run against the Boston Red Sox Monday night was potent inspiration. PAGE B13
 SKATER'S DEATH LEAVES MYSTERY
 Van Wastell was born into a renowned snowboarding family, and before his 20th birthday he was hurtling toward stardom as a skateboarder. He set himself apart from the rest of the field with deft athleticism, prodigious creativity and a devil-may-care public image. But when his body was found last month in the alley behind a hotel in Berlin, apparently the victim of a fall, Wastell, 24, became the subject of enduring intrigue. PAGE B13
 HIGH SCHOOL PLAYER DIES
 A football player for Montclair High School in New Jersey who sustained a brain hemorrhage during a game three days ago died Wednesday night, a spokeswoman for the Hackensack University Medical Center confirmed. The player, Ryne Dougherty, a junior linebacker, collapsed after making a tackle during a junior varsity game. Dougherty is the third teenager to die in New Jersey in the last three months after participating in football activities. PAGE B18
 BUSINESS
 STOCKS RIDE ENERGY COMPANIES
 For Late Afternoon Recovery
 Stocks gained 400 points in the final minutes, despite a rash of weak reports on the health of the economy. The Dow Jones industrial average, which had lurched up and down the chart, mounted its recovery on the back of shares of energy companies and consumer favorites like McDonald's. The broader Standard& Poor's 500-stock index rose 4.3 percent and the Nasdaq gained about 5.5 percent. PAGE B5
 DOCTORS' TIES QUESTIONED
 Two senators looking into potential conflicts of interest are asking tough questions about the financial ties between heart doctors and the companies that make medical devices, notably heart stents. The senators, Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and Herb Kohl, Democrat of Wisconsin, sent a letter asking the Cardiovascular Research Foundation for information about its financial relationships with device manufacturers and drug producers. PAGE B3
 GOOGLE PROFITS UP 26%
 Analysts are growing increasingly confident that Google just might be recession-proof. Its growth rate continued to slow in the third quarter, but the company fared better than Wall Street had expected as it reported a solid 26 percent jump in net income to $1.35 billion, or $4.24 a share, compared with $1.07 billion in the third quarter of 2007. The company's results were bolstered by strong gains in online advertising and efforts by Google to slow hiring and rein in costs. PAGE B1
 CANADA LOOKS TO FRANCE FOR TRADE
 Canada is expected to take a step back from its trade relationship with the United States, whose economy is in disarray and whose global leadership is in question. Canada's prime minister, Stephen Harper, and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France are expected to sign an agreement for preliminary negotiations intended to create a trade pact between Canada and Europe that would be even more sweeping than the North American Free Trade Agreement. PAGE B7
 TWO MORE AIRLINES POST LOSSES
 Two more major airlines said they lost money in the third quarter, including Southwest, which posted a loss of $120 million because of a noncash charge to write down the declining value of its hedging contracts for jet fuel. Continental Airlines said it lost $145 million. PAGE B3
 ESCAPES
 WHEN A VACATION RETREAT
 Becomes a Retirement Home
 A fair number of vacation homes are bought with the idea that they will become full-time retirement residences. The key to making a successful transition, according to real estate agents and people who have made such moves, is to become involved with the community. PAGE D1
 AN OVERLOOKED JEWEL
 For most Californians, the notion of mountains conjures up the vast Sierra Nevada. In contrast, the Trinities are pocket-size. A five-hour drive north of the San Francisco Bay Area, the region exudes the feel of a place that time is in the process of forgetting. PAGE D8
 Weekend
 THE END OF THE VERY WORLD,
 Now on View Behind Glass
 Reminiscent of one of those houses that horrifyingly depict the wages of sin, ''Climate Change: The Threat to Life and a New Energy Future,'' at the American Museum of Natural History, is heavy on the dire straits. Polar bears forage around junk heaps and the tip of Manhattan is underwater. It's all very ''Scared Straight,'' reduce your emissions now, or else. And watch that carbon footprint, Edward Rothstein writes. Page C25 
 SMALL WORKS FOR A PRIVATE MOMENT
 Small works in bronze by one of the most famous sculptors of the Italian Renaissance, 35 to be exact, are on display at the Frick Collection. The show, ''Andrea Riccio: Renaissance Master of Bronze,'' features small-scale statuettes, oil lamps and reliefs. They appear at first modest and ordinary, but allow your eyes to see their expressive nature and you might just fall for them, Ken Johnson writes. Page C28 
 MADONNA IN THE DIRECTOR'S CHAIR
 Bumping, grinding and stripping with a salacious twist and a concern for impoverished African children, that's ''Filth and Wisdom,'' directed and written by the pop star Madonna. In London, three roommates peddle themselves to fulfill their dreams. From light bondage or riding a silver pole in gentlemen's clubs, the film keeps you watching while not doing anything very original, Manohla Dargis writes. Page C10 
 SQUEEZING POP FROM A BLUES STONE
 With pop sensibilities that seem to be steeped deeply in that Southern boogie, the Cold War Kids slammed their way through a recent set at Webster Hall in New York. Ranging from blues-seasoned rock to dirges and melodrama, it was obvious which of their material they favored most, but when it was right, it was right on, no matter how wrong it may have been, Nate Chinen writes. Page C5 
 Editorial
 THE ACORN STORY
 In Wednesday night's debate, Senator John McCain warned that a group called Acorn might be ''destroying the fabric of democracy.'' Viewers may have been wondering what Mr. McCain was talking about. So were we. page A26
 TALE OF THREE RIVALS
 Ukraine's president, Viktor Yushchenko, has called the third parliamentary election in three years to try to resolve his never-ending political struggle with his two rivals. The main thing is to make sure these are elections by and for Ukraine, without meddling from Russia or the West. page A26
 $1,000 FOR 50 POINTS
 Some colleges seem more concerned with their own rankings than with fairly ranking applicants. Baylor University in Texas is a particularly embarrassing example. The school has been paying freshmen it admitted to retake the SAT. page A26

 PAUL KRUGMAN
 It's politically fashionable to rant against government spending and demand fiscal responsibility. But right now, increased government spending is just what the doctor ordered, and concerns about the budget deficit should be put on hold. page A27
 DAVID BROOKS
 There has never been a moment when, at least in public, Senator Barack Obama seems gripped by inner turmoil. It's not willpower or self-discipline he shows as much as an organized unconscious. Through some deep, bottom-up process, he has developed strategies for equanimity and now he's become a homeostasis machine. page A27
 BUY AMERICAN. I AM.
 The financial world is a mess, writes Warren E. Buffett, the chief executive of Berkshire Hathaway, a diversified holding company, adding that history tells us that this is precisely the time to invest in American stocks. page A27

HARVARD ART MUSEUM RECEIVES PULITZER GIFT
 As museums grapple with the potential effects of the economic crisis, the Harvard Art Museum has received a windfall from Emily Rauh Pulitzer, a former curator who earned a graduate degree at Harvard, that includes artworks worth nearly $200 million and a cash gift of $45 million.
 The bulk of the money will go toward the expansion and renovation of 32 Quincy Street in Cambridge, Mass., the building that formerly housed the university's Fogg Art Museum and the Busch-Reisinger Museum. The university plans to integrate its arts holdings from the Fogg, the Busch-Reisinger and its Arthur M. Sackler Museum there in a project overseen by the architect Renzo Piano. 
 The art to be donated by Mrs. Pulitzer includes 31 modern and contemporary works. Although Harvard's art collection boasts about 265,000 objects, said Thomas W. Lentz, the museum's director, it had ''shocking gaps'' in the postwar period that the gift will help remedy. 
 Ms. Pulitzer and her husband, the newspaper scion and collector Joseph Pulitzer Jr., who died in 1993, have been major donors to Harvard for decades. Over the years they have financed the purchase of 92 works of art, including paintings by Georg Baselitz, Georges Braque and Piet Mondrian. 
 ''Harvard is developing a really exciting program with a greater emphasis on 20th-century art,'' Mrs. Pulitzer said in a telephone interview. 
 She is also a founder and chairwoman of the Pulitzer Foundation for the Arts, which opened in St. Louis seven years ago in a building designed by the Japanese architect Tadao Ando. She said the gift to Harvard was intended not only to strengthen its holdings but also to make the museum a more important part of the university.
 She said Mr. Lentz had given her a list of the art the university needed most. Helen Molesworth, head of the Harvard Art Museum's department of modern and contemporary art, ''wrote such a compelling plea'' for a Richard Serra sculpture, ''Untitled (Corner Prop Piece),'' that she has already sent it to Harvard, Mrs. Pulitzer said. 
 The gift also includes major works like one of Picasso's ''Harlequin'' paintings from 1918; a self-portrait by Vuilliard; two Brancusi sculptures, including ''Sleeping Muse II'' from 1926; sculptures by Alberto Giacometti; and prime examples by Donald Judd, Roy Lichtenstein and Claes Oldenburg. 
 While some of the works will go on view in galleries in the building that now houses the Sackler, most of them will be displayed in the Quincy Street building after the expansion is completed in 2013. 
 A MET CANOPY RETURNS
 An 18-foot-tall Italian ciborium, or altar canopy, that has been on view at the Cloisters, the Metropolitan Museum's medieval-style outpost in Fort Tryon Park, will return to the Met's Fifth Avenue building. 
 Moving the 12th-century marble structure, which is decorated with colored hardstone and gilt-glass mosaics, was a complex five-month undertaking that included cleaning, dismantling and reassembling the work. ''Moving it back to the Met is something I've wanted to do since I came here in 1998,'' said Peter Barnet, the Met curator for medieval art and the Cloisters. An expansion of the museum's galleries for Byzantine and Western European art dating from 1050 to 1300, which open on Nov. 18, gave him the opportunity to rethink the collection. ''It had been in a reconstructed chapel in the Cloisters, where we are now installing stained glass,'' Mr. Barnet said. He said the transfer of the ciborium would free up that chapel and provide a centerpiece for the Met's newly renovated gallery. 
 The canopy originally surrounded the altar in the Church of Santo Stefano near Fiano Romano, northwest of Rome. Attributed to Nicolaus Ranucius and his sons, Johannes and Guittone, part of a Roman family of marble workers, it consists of four plain white marble columns with square bases, Corinthian capitals and a complex polygonal roof. It was removed from Santo Stefano around 1889, when the church lost its religious function, and was purchased by the Met in 1909 from Henry W. Poor, a financier, publisher and collector. It was one of the earliest purchases of a major Italian Romanesque work of art by an American museum. 
 It was transferred to the Cloisters in the late 1940s, although Mr. Barnet said it was unclear what motivated the move. 
 ''Now the public will be able to see it from all angles,'' he said, ''something that wasn't possible at the Cloisters.'' 
 CHRISTIE'S REVISES POLICY
 The economic downturn has prompted Christie's to institute a new policy: Although extended payment terms remain in place, art can no longer be released until it is paid for in full. This week Christie's has been calling top clients to deliver the news.
 ''We are being particularly prudent in these volatile financial times,'' said Marc Porter, president of Christie's in the Americas. 
 Its arch-rival, Sotheby's, reported a week ago that it had borrowed $250 million from Bank of America. On Thursday a Sotheby's spokesman, Matthew Weigman, said, ''Sotheby's has always made credit decisions on a case-by-case basis and will continue to do so.'' 
 CONCOURSE COLLAGES
 Last month the Bronx Museum of Art opened an interactive display of photographs of everyday street sights in the borough and invited the public to create collages. The photographs, on view in the lobby as part of the exhibition ''Street Art, Street Life: From the 1950s to Now,'' were taken in recent months by the Nigerian-born artist Fatimah Tuggar. 
 In a project organized by the Public Art Fund 11 collages selected by Ms. Tuggar went on view this week on bus shelters along the Grand Concourse. ''It's been more than 20 years since the Public Art Fund has worked with bus shelters,'' said Rochelle Steiner, the fund's director. 
 NATIONAL GALLERY CURATOR
 The National Gallery of Art in Washington has appointed Mary L. Levkoff, curator of European sculpture and classical antiquities at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, as its new curator of sculpture and decorative arts. She replaces Nicholas Penny, who left in February to become director of the National Gallery in London.

HEADLINE: A.M.D.'s Results Show Improvement

BYLINE: By LAURIE J. FLYNN

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
Advanced Micro Devices, the troubled chip maker, said on Thursday that its earnings were showing significant improvement despite the turmoil in the economy.
 The company, which is preparing to spin off its manufacturing operations and focus on chip design, reported its eighth consecutive loss but beat Wall Street's forecasts for both revenue and earnings. 
 The improvement was attributed in part to strong demand for A.M.D.'s new line of graphics processors, which were released during the quarter. 
 A.M.D. reported a net loss of $67 million, or 11 cents a share, in the third quarter, compared with a loss of $396 million, or 71 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue rose 14 percent to $1.78 billion, helped by $191 million in revenue from technology licenses. 
 Excluding one-time charges, A.M.D. said it turned a profit of $80 million, or about 13 cents a share. 
 Analysts had expected a loss of 40 cents a share excluding charges, on revenue of $1.48 billion, according to a survey by Thomson Financial. 
 ''These are very strong numbers,'' said Cody G. Acree, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. ''It means they are doing something right with new products.''
 Dirk Meyer, A.M.D.'s president and chief executive, called the performance ''directionally correct,'' but not entirely satisfactory.
 ''We're on a path to be the company we aspire to be,'' he said.
 On the critical measure of gross margin, A.M.D. also beat Wall Street's estimates. Gross margin for the quarter was 45 percent excluding licensing fees, compared with analysts' average forecast of 41 percent.
 The report was released after the close of trading Thursday. Shares of A.M.D. rose as much as 19 percent in after-hours trading; they closed up 21 cents at $4.12 in regular trading.
 Looking ahead, A.M.D. expects revenue in the fourth quarter to be roughly the same as in the last quarter.
 A.M.D.'s report follows a largely downbeat forecast from its rival Intel. On Tuesday, Paul S. Otellini, Intel's chief executive, warned investors that the global economic crisis could hurt Intel's business in the coming months, but he said it was too soon to determine the actual impact. He said that while Intel experienced some ''softness'' in September, the company's profit rose 12 percent during the third quarter, but sales rose only 1 percent. 
 Last week, A.M.D. announced plans to split into two entities. One will continue to design microprocessors, while a new company, owned jointly by A.M.D. and a fund controlled by the Abu Dhabi government, will manufacture them.
 The announcement of the split-up of A.M.D., based in Sunnyvale, Calif., came just as investors were starting to lose confidence in the company. In the last few years, A.M.D. lost considerable ground as it endured a bruising price war and encountered technical problems that hampered the introduction of its critical new chip, Barcelona. A.M.D. had long been struggling to pay for capital-intensive plants in order to stay competitive.
 The Advanced Technology Investment Company, created by the Abu Dhabi government, said it would invest up to $8 billion in A.M.D.'s factory spinoff in exchange for a 55.6 percent stake in the new company. 
 After A.M.D.'s seventh consecutive quarterly loss, reported in July, the company's board ousted Hector Ruiz from the chief executive job and replaced him with Mr. Meyer, an engineer who had been president and chief operating officer since 2006.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Show Little Change in September

BYLINE: By MICHAEL M. GRYNBAUM

 BODY:
The economy may be sputtering, but the threat of stagflation -- a concern among some economists just weeks ago -- appears to have receded somewhat.
 Prices paid for common consumer products did not budge in September, the Labor Department said on Thursday, keeping in line with a similar slowdown in August. 
 The Consumer Price Index, considered an important gauge of inflation, was unchanged last month, driven down by cheaper gasoline, heating oil and clothing.
 The sharp decline in oil prices, which began in July, has led to lower prices for many Americans at the shopping mall. Outside of energy and food products, the core index rose 0.1 percent.
 In the last 12 months, consumer prices grew 4.9 percent, less than the 5.4 percent annual rate recorded in August. The core index rose 2.5 percent in the last year.
 Stock index futures jumped after the report, as investors bet that the more optimistic economic data would bring buyers back into the stock market.
 The report comes a day after the government said that prices paid by businesses and wholesalers declined in August. The chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke, also said on Wednesday that inflation pressures would recede in the fall as the economy slows further.
 The latest figures on inflation do not suggest that the economic downturn will be avoided, but suggested that the country might sidestep some of the stagflation seen in the 1970s. The combination of stagnant growth and rising prices would make it even more difficult for businesses and consumers to navigate a slowdown. This week's reports also make it easier for Fed policy makers to lower interest rates.
 ''The inflation news is brightening by the day,'' Rob Carnell, an economist at ING Bank, wrote in a note.
 Prices for transportation, motor vehicles, and clothing were all down last month. Foods and beverages cost more, as did medical care.
 In another economic report, the Federal Reserve said that industry production declined significantly in September, largely because of hurricanes Gustav and Ike. Production at the factories, mines and utilities fell 2.8 percent in September, on top of a 1 percent drop in August.
 The Fed estimated that disruptions from the two hurricanes accounted for about 2.25 percentage points of the total drop in industrial production in September. 
 A separate report on Thursday said that new claims for unemployment benefits dipped by 16,000 last week to the 461,000 level. Continuing claims remained at a five-year high while the four-week moving average of jobless claims is at a seven-year high.

 BODY:
Often Asked Q:
 Is It Time to Buy?
 How much should you pay to buy a factory? All things being equal, about as much as it cost to build it. For a company? A stock market? Roughly speaking, about as much as they cost to create. That, at least, is the insight behind a measure called Tobin's Q, used by some analysts to gauge stock market value.
 This theory, devised by the economist James Tobin, measures the relationship of the market price of an asset to the cost of replacing it. When the market price is higher than the replacement cost, Tobin's Q runs above 1. Usually, only rabid bears think stocks should trade with a Q as low as 1. But after recent declines, the companies composing the S.& P. 500-stock index now cost about the same to buy as they would to build. 
 Andrew Smithers, a strategist with Smithers & Company, has calculated historical replacement costs for the S.& P. index. His calculations use simplified assumptions -- for instance, they don't include financial assets, and they don't take intangibles like brand values into account. But they are probably as good as it gets for indicative purposes. 
 His latest replacement-cost value for the companies in the index -- calculated for the second quarter of 2008 -- implies, assuming a Q of 1, a value for the S.& P. of 910. A few weeks ago, when the S.& P. was still trading well above 1,000, that still seemed unrealistically low. But at one point on Thursday, the index dipped below 870 -- a Q below 1, based on calculations by Mr. Smithers -- before closing at 946.
 If Mr. Tobin's concept were a good predictor of stock prices, it could soon be time to think about buying. But the stock market's gyrations over the last century have been quite wide. At its 2000 peak, the S.& P. stood 125 percent above the level implied by a Q of 1. In the six market lows since 1920, the index has, on average, fallen to a level only just above half the estimated replacement cost.
 So Q is not quackery, but neither is it a surefire indicator of when to invest in the stock market. As to the question -- ''Is it time to buy?'' -- the answer is ''not quite yet.'' 
 Swiss Raise the Bar 
 The British set the standard last week on bank clean-ups, leaving America and others to play catch up after it announced government investments in its banks. But the Swiss have now leaped over the bar set by the British by establishing a fresh benchmark for bank rescues. 
 Some actions announced by Swiss authorities Thursday to shore up the banking system track those of their counterparts. There is, for instance, a pledge to guarantee certain bank borrowing if needed. The government is also injecting new capital into UBS, Switzerland's largest bank, to the tune of 6 billion Swiss francs ($5.3 billion). 
 This will cost UBS shareholders, but given the exodus from its private bank and asset management arms in the third quarter, the bank had few options but to participate in the government program. In addition, UBS may be able to resume dividends next year. By comparison, British banks receiving government assistance will face tighter restrictions, while the American rescue plan is less onerous to financial institutions. 
 The big new idea the Swiss have come up with, however, is the creation of a ''bad bank'' to take up to $60 billion of mortgage-related and other toxic assets from UBS. The bank itself will supply the new vehicle with $6 billion of equity capital to accompany a $54 billion loan from the Swiss central bank. The intention with a bad bank is to sell assets and wind it down reasonably quickly -- a better guiding principle than the longer-term asset management notion that underlies the United States Treasury's Troubled Asset Relief Program. 
 Switzerland's other big bank, Credit Suisse, declined government help -- as Barclays did in Britain. But Credit Suisse has already secured 10 billion francs of new money from existing shareholders based in Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Israel. Barclays has merely persuaded the British government that it will be able to do something similar before long.
 The Swiss -- learning from others' experiences -- have come up with the most effective-looking bailout yet. EDWARD HADAS AND JEFFREY GOLDFARB

HEADLINE: Honeywell Cuts Its 4th-Quarter Profit Forecast

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Honeywell International cut its fourth-quarter profit forecast and said it would brace for ''recessionary conditions'' in the United States and Europe next year. Third-quarter profit increased to $719 million, or 97 cents a share, from $618 million, or 81 cents a share, a year earlier. That topped the average Wall Street estimate by 2 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 6.2 percent, to $9.28 billion. Honeywell now expects to earn 97 cents to $1.01 a share on revenue of $9.4 billion in the fourth quarter. Analysts, on average, had looked for profit of $1.04 a share on sales of $9.8 billion.

HEADLINE: What's the Matter at City Hall: Democracy, the Voice of the People and All That

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN. 
E-mail: haberman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Let's begin with a civics quiz.
 Of the following political figures, whose actions have shown a true belief in the concept that the people, not the politicians, should decide an issue as fundamental as term limits for government leaders? Is it (a) Michael R. Bloomberg, New York's mayor, (b) Christine C. Quinn, New York's City Council speaker, or (c) Hugo Chavez, Venezuela's president?
 Stumped? Here are some hints, starting with the mayor and the Council speaker. 
 They struck a deal to undermine the results of two referendums in the 1990s in which New York City voters said by large margins that important officeholders -- including the mayor and all 51 Council members -- should be limited to two consecutive terms. Mr. Bloomberg and Ms. Quinn used to speak about those two plebiscites as virtually amounting to sacraments. Not anymore.
 This week, Ms. Quinn made it clear that she would be Mr. Bloomberg's chief enabler in the Council to push through a voter-dodging bill that would stretch the limit to three terms. The bill goes by the nondescript title of Proposed Intro No. 845-A. You may reasonably think of it as the Incumbency Protection Act of 2008.
 On Thursday, a hearing was held in the main Council chamber. As a sign of how critical this issue is, more than half of the Council's members showed up -- an unusually high turnout.
 The room was packed with spectators. Dozens of seats were filled with people carrying green signs bearing slogans like ''Democrats for Choices: Extend Term Limits.'' They were on the mayor's side. (Essentially, he and his minions assert that by taking away the people's right to decide the future of term limits, they are actually increasing the voters' ballot options in next year's municipal elections. In other words, less choice means more choice. Orwell, anyone?)
 The sign holders resisted efforts to find out who they were and why they had gone to City Hall. Everything about them screamed rent-a-crowd.
 The hearing stretched into the night. It is scheduled to resume on Friday morning. And that will be that for the public's say in the matter.
 Typically on so highly sensitive an issue, with nothing less than the democratic process on the line, many hearings are held, often with at least one in every borough. But this is a rush job. The full Council may vote on the matter next week. The bill is moving like an express train. It might as well be called the Bloomberg Unlimited.
 Both the mayor and the speaker bristle at suggestions that theirs is ''a backroom deal.'' They may be right. Who knows what room the deal was made in? But they definitely have, shall we say, an understanding.
 In lavishly praising Ms. Quinn, Mr. Bloomberg used some intriguing language on Monday. Were she not in government, he said, she ''would have enormous opportunities in the private sector as well as the public sector.'' Until the billionaire businessman-turned-politician uttered those words, no one had talked about Ms. Quinn in any kind of role beyond government service.
 Then on Wednesday, having rejected holding a third voter referendum on New York's electoral process, Mr. Bloomberg flew to Los Angeles to support a referendum that would change how Californians elect their public officials. He was not amused when someone pointed out the contrast. Chalk it off to a sudden bout of irony deficiency anemia.
 Ms. Quinn had her own interesting take on the end-run around New York voters. At a news conference this week, she described Proposed Intro No. 845-A as ''the essence of democracy.'' When asked how New Yorkers could be assured that they won't witness a similar attempt to cling to power four years from now, Ms. Quinn replied, ''I don't believe this is something that we'll see happening on a regular basis.''
 Let's see. After the 2001 terrorist attacks, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani used that crisis to try to keep himself in office beyond the expiration date set by term limits. The ploy didn't work. Now Mr. Bloomberg and Ms. Quinn are using this economic crisis to extend their stay in office.
 How many times must New Yorkers see this movie before it qualifies as ''happening on a regular basis''?
 Oh, yes, we haven't forgotten the civics quiz. Here's another hint: Ten months ago, Mr. Chavez of Venezuela held a referendum on his attempt to increase his considerable power by, among other things, ending term limits. He lost.
 In the last few days, a few critics of Mr. Bloomberg and Ms. Quinn have cited Venezuela's experience. Generally speaking, any day when New York's leaders are compared unfavorably with Hugo Chavez is probably not a good day.

HEADLINE: G.M. Teeters Toward Merger

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC; Nick Bunkley contributed reporting.

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
Rick Wagoner is running short of time and options to save General Motors and salvage his legacy as leader of the world's biggest automaker.
 With G.M. burning through cash and auto sales sinking to historic lows, Mr. Wagoner is pushing hard for a merger with Chrysler -- in talks reported in The New York Times a week ago -- after testing the waters for a similar deal with the Ford Motor Company.
 The fact that Mr. Wagoner is even considering a merger with one of his cross-town rivals illustrates G.M.'s precarious state.
 Mr. Wagoner, G.M.'s chief executive since 2000 and the chairman since 2003, has not granted interviews since the Chrysler talks were revealed. But Mr. Wagoner and G.M.'s president, Frederick A. Henderson, are convinced that the automaker is in dire need of the cash, additional revenue and cost savings that a merger could provide, according to several people with knowledge of the talks. 
 The merger discussions, intended to be private, are gaining momentum as both sides want to reach an agreement within the next two to three weeks, according to people briefed on the discussions. 
 Financial institutions that hold Chrysler debt, including JPMorgan Chase and Goldman Sachs, are pressing Cerberus Capital Management, which owns Chrysler, to sell the automaker, these people said. 
 In recent weeks, the credit crisis and weak economy have driven auto sales to their lowest levels in 15 years, and ratcheted up pressure on Mr. Wagoner. 
 G.M.'s shares sank below $5 last week, as analysts projected that the automaker could exhaust its cash reserves -- $21 billion at the end of the second quarter -- by early next year and possibly be forced into a bankruptcy filing. 
 G.M.'s most actively traded bond was up slightly on Thursday, at 22 cents on the dollar, a sign of investors' skepticism about the company's prospects in the near future. G.M. has responded in recent months by announcing sharp cuts to its North American vehicle production that it said would bolster its cash position by $10 billion through cost cuts. It also hopes to raise $5 billion by selling assets like its Hummer brand. 
 Shares rebounded on news of the Chrysler discussions, closing at $6.40 on Thursday, up 2.9 percent. But that has hardly alleviated the gloom hanging over G.M. and the rest of Detroit. The company's market capitalization is just $3.6 billion.
 ''This is the worst that G.M. has looked in nearly 50 years,'' said David Healy, an analyst with Burnham Securities. ''If auto sales stay at this level, they can't survive for very long.''
 G.M. lost $18.8 billion in the first half of this year. Mr. Healy projects that G.M. will lose $2.9 billion during the third quarter, not including special charges, and its revenues will decline about 12 percent, to $38.5 billion.
 Making matters worse, G.M. is burning through more than $1 billion in cash each month, according to analyst estimates -- with no end in sight.
 ''Macroeconomic factors could overwhelm them at some point,'' said Robert Schulz, lead auto analyst with the Standard & Poor's credit-rating agency.
 For Mr. Wagoner -- an analytical executive and former Duke basketball player who joined G.M. straight out of Harvard Business School -- the deepening crisis threatens to torpedo a methodical turnaround plan that appeared promising when he started it three years ago.
 Since 2005, G.M. has cut $9 billion in structural costs and reduced its worldwide employment 18 percent, to 266,000 workers.
 The cuts have been even broader in its core North American operations, where G.M. has reduced its number of employees by about 30 percent, and downsized its annual production by 800,000 vehicles. Its market share has been falling for years, down to 22.4 percent in September.
 Mr. Wagoner also earned credit for negotiating a new contract last year with the United Automobile Workers union that reduced wages for new hires and created a trust to administer health care costs for retirees.
 But shrinking G.M. has not been enough to counteract the effects of rising gas prices on sales of trucks and sport utility vehicles, and tightening lending standards for people who want to buy new vehicles.
 ''This has been a period of unprecedented chaos in the auto market,'' said David E. Cole, chairman of the Center for Automotive Research in Ann Arbor, Mich. ''It's not just G.M. It's Ford and Chrysler and everybody else.''
 Yet as the leader of the industry's biggest player, Mr. Wagoner has become the focal point for what's gone wrong in Detroit.
 ''If you start reciting the adversity that's come his way in the last three or four years, it's a long list,'' said Gerald C. Meyers, a University of Michigan business professor and former chief executive of American Motors. ''In order to survive, he has to be hardened. Not get used to it, but not be torn by it.''
 In August, the lead director on G.M.'s board, George Fisher, made a rare public declaration of the board's support of Mr. Wagoner.
 ''These are the toughest times I have ever seen,'' Mr. Fisher said. ''But we are absolutely convinced we have the right team under Mr. Wagoner's leadership.''
 The board's support of Mr. Wagoner will be necessary again, though, if G.M. hopes to close a deal with Chrysler. The board has formed a special committee to study the matter.
 G.M. needs the $11 billion in cash that is currently on Chrysler's books, and Cerberus is said to be considering a large investment in G.M. stock should the deal be done.
 However, merging with Chrysler -- whose United States sales have fallen 25 percent this year -- would carry risks for G.M.
 To get Chrysler's cash and revenues, Mr. Wagoner would be trying to meld two organizations with overlapping brands.
 In addition, he would have to drastically reduce Chrysler's manufacturing capacity and employment, and absorb billions of dollars of its outstanding debt.
 The possibility of a merger is still considered 50-50, according to people briefed on the talks. Cerberus is said to be considering other possible partners for Chrysler, including the alliance of Nissan Motor of Japan and the French carmaker Renault (the two companies develop vehicles together and hold cross-ownership stakes). 
 Mr. Wagoner had an opportunity to acquire Chrysler in 2006 before it was put up for auction by its owner at the time, the German automaker Daimler.
 But Mr. Wagoner showed minimal interest then, and he also rejected a chance for G.M. to join the Nissan-Renault alliance, vowing that G.M. could turn around its business on its own.
 Now Mr. Wagoner, 55, faces the prospect of cutting a deal for Chrysler or perhaps another automaker -- or possibly going down in history as the executive who presided over G.M.'s demise.
 Adding Chrysler and its cash hoard could give G.M. some breathing room until the auto market recovers. ''In this case, money is time,'' Mr. Healy said.
 Industry experts now predict that auto sales in 2009 could be even worse.
 One critical factor in G.M.'s favor could be the availability of $25 billion in federal loans for automakers to retool their factories for the production of more fuel-efficient vehicles. The loans could free up cash already earmarked by G.M., Ford and Chrysler for alternative-fuel projects.
 Analysts say G.M. and the other automakers may also be preparing to ask for additional financial help from the government, after the Nov. 4 election.
 ''The big question is whether the government is going to let G.M. or other industry members fail,'' Mr. Cole said.
 People close to G.M. say they do not believe Mr. Wagoner's job to be in jeopardyfrom his board, which has been holding weekly conference calls since the summer to monitor the company's performance.
 Indeed, the greatest risk may be to the company, not the person running it. ''In any other situation where the results are as poor as they are in this business, the board would have long ago let him go,'' Mr. Meyers said. ''But it doesn't do any good to fire the chief executive now because the next guy in is not going to do any more to save it.''

HEADLINE: Corzine Outlines Steps to Counteract the Fiscal Crisis

BYLINE: By PATRICK MCGEEHAN

 BODY:
Seeking to blunt the effects of the financial crisis on New Jersey, Gov. Jon S. Corzine laid out a $150 million package of tax breaks and state spending on Thursday that he said would spur the creation of jobs and help struggling homeowners stave off foreclosure.
 Addressing a special joint session of the State Legislature in Trenton, Mr. Corzine proposed giving businesses $3,000 for each new employee they hire and called for state agencies and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to immediately speed up work on approved infrastructure projects. He also proposed depositing $500 million of state funds money from state pension funds in community banks to spur them to lend to local businesses. 
 ''Too many of our neighbors and friends are living with a layoff, lost health care, a mortgage larger than the value of their home or a late notice on a credit-card bill,'' Mr. Corzine said in his midday speech. ''We can't stand by.''
 The efforts to stimulate the economy come as the gap in the state budget widens. Mr. Corzine said the state treasurer's ''best guess'' on the state's revenue shortfall this fiscal year is $400 million. 
 New Jersey's economy has been weakening for several months. The state has lost 21,000 jobs this year, including 3,900 last month, and its unemployment rate has risen to 5.8 percent, from just over 4 percent in mid-2007. The average home price in the state has fallen about 10 percent from its peak and the rate of decline has been accelerating.
 To pay for his new proposals, which he estimated would cost the state $150 million, the governor said he had directed state officials to start cutting spending on equipment and consultants. 
 ''We will undoubtedly need more cuts,'' he said. ''We may have to take more drastic steps in the months ahead.''
 Alex DeCroce, the Assembly's Republican leader, said that he supported some of Mr. Corzine's ideas in principle, but added, ''I'm not sure if all of them will fly.''
 Mr. DeCroce said it had been years since he had heard a proposal to pay companies for hiring workers, but he said that if it is done right, it could be a constructive approach to fighting unemployment. He also said he doubted whether investing in banks was necessary. He would rather see the governor endorse the Republicans' proposal of halving the state sales tax during the holiday shopping season to stimulate consumer spending and lure out-of-state residents to New Jersey's stores and malls, he said.
 ''It seems like we're just growing government, that there's going to be a larger government and more spending,'' Mr. DeCroce said.
 Mr. Corzine, a Democrat, has been talking about accelerating spending on transportation projects, like widening the New Jersey Turnpike, for several weeks. But on Thursday, he also called for a less risky variation of Washington's playbook by proposing an infusion of state money into local banks to induce them to make more loans to companies caught in the credit crunch. (Mr. Corzine and Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson, the architect of the federal government's bailout plan, once shared the chief executive's job at Goldman Sachs.)
 Mr. Corzine's plan calls for $500 million of state pension funds and other state-managed funds to be lent to banks in the state at market interest rates, providing the banks with more money with which to make business loans. The state's Economic Development Authority would pitch in $50 million in financing for small and medium-size businesses.
 But it was not clear whether that step would have the desired effect. James Silkensen, president of the New Jersey League of Community Bankers, said he had not heard complaints from his members about needing more cash.
 ''Our members are telling us that they've got money to lend,'' Mr. Silkensen said. ''They aren't going to change their underwriting standards. I can't say every bank has sufficient funds to lend. But most I have talked to are lending, though they're being careful.''
 Mr. Corzine's idea for getting small businesses to hire new workers was simpler: He proposed that for the next two years, any company with 500 or fewer employees receive $3,000 for each worker hired and retained for a year.
 ''Create a job and we will send you a $3,000 check,'' he said.
 Companies should also receive tax credits for capital investments they make, he added.
 To slow the rising number of foreclosures in New Jersey -- now 50,000 a year -- Mr. Corzine said he had worked with the State Office of the Courts to make mediation mandatory in all contested foreclosures. He said that program would be implemented within a month in the seven counties with the highest numbers of foreclosures and within two months in other counties.
 ''Mediation can literally stop unnecessary foreclosure actions and allow for informed workouts,'' the governor said. 
 Among Mr. Corzine's other proposals were an increase in emergency aid to food banks, an additional $10 million appropriation to help 200,000 households cover the costs of heating. and property tax breaks for the elderly.

HEADLINE: Polls Cause Campaigns to Change Their Itineraries

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and JIM RUTENBERG; Michael Cooper and Jeff Zeleny contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Confronting an increasingly bleak electoral map, top aides to Senator John McCain said Thursday that they were searching for a ''narrow-victory scenario'' and would focus in the final weeks on a dwindling number of states, using mailings, telephone calls and television advertisements to try to tear away support from Senator Barack Obama.
 Mr. Obama's advisers said they would use the remaining 19 days of the campaign to focus mainly on capturing states that President Bush won in 2004; he is going to Missouri, North Carolina and Virginia, over the next three days and spending two days in Florida next week. 
 In a sign of the differing fortunes of the candidates, advisers to Mr. Obama said he was escalating his effort in West Virginia, which Mr. Bush won by 13 points in 2004, with a surge in advertising spending and a campaign swing there in the coming days by Mr. Obama or his running mate, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr. 
 ''West Virginia is real,'' said Mr. Obama's campaign manager, David Plouffe. ''We have been watching it for a long time.''
 By contrast, Mr. McCain is spending the next three days campaigning in states that Mr. Bush won in 2004 and that earlier this year Republicans had considered relatively safe: he will visit Florida on Friday, followed by North Carolina, Virginia and Ohio. Republicans said their hopes of capturing any state the Democrats won in 2004 appeared to be dwindling, though they said they held out hope for Pennsylvania, where Mr. McCain campaigned on Thursday but where he has recently slipped far behind Mr. Obama in some polls.
 The emerging strategies were described by top aides to the candidates as the long campaign turned to the final chapter, following the last presidential debate Wednesday night. By every indication, Mr. Obama entered this post-debate period in a significantly stronger position than Mr. McCain, with broader support in polls, more options for an Electoral College victory and voters increasingly fixated on the economic crisis, to the decided advantage of Mr. Obama.
 Mr. McCain's advisers said that in his speeches, television advertisements and mailings, he would seize on a remark Mr. Obama made in an encounter with an Ohio voter, Joe Wurzelbacher, who had pressed him to explain his support for a tax increase for upper-income filers. Mr. Obama responded by saying he wanted to ''spread the wealth.'' Mr. McCain repeatedly invoked that encounter with the man, whom he called ''Joe the Plumber,'' during the debate on Wednesday.
 ''Spread the wealth around: We will focus acutely on that,'' said Steve Schmidt, Mr. McCain's chief strategist. ''Spread the wealth around is a big mistake.''
 With a sense of anxiety rising among Republicans, many were urging the McCain campaign to abandon its effort to win back the four Democratic states where Mr. McCain is still competing but is behind in polls --Minnesota, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- and instead put all its resources into holding on to the states Mr. Bush won in 2004. In one sign of this, the Republican National Committee, which operates independently of the McCain campaign, pulled its advertisements out of Wisconsin, a state where polls show Mr. Obama pulling away.
 But Mr. McCain's advisers made clear that their candidate would continue to campaign aggressively in those states, even as they acknowledged that their options were limited.
 ''The scenario for winning for us is a narrow-victory scenario,'' Mr. Schmidt said. ''The fact that we're in the race at all -- within striking distance with a 5 percent right track -- is a miracle. Because the environment is so bad and the head wind is so strong.'' 
 Mr. Plouffe said he viewed Colorado and Virginia as the two states that Mr. Obama had the best chance of pulling from the Republican column.
 Mr. Obama outspent Mr. McCain on television by four-to-one nationally last week, displaying a financial advantage that Mr. McCain's advisers described as smothering.
 Still, the Republican National Committee and Mr. McCain by all appearances have retained a significant amount of money to pay for a late surge of television advertisements, get-out-the-vote calls and mailings. On Thursday, an independent unit of the party began an $18 million advertising campaign that will run until Election Day and started with a commercial questioning Mr. Obama's qualifications to lead. 
 Called ''The Chair'' and running in eight states -- including Indiana, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Virginia -- the spot shows the president's desk in the Oval Office as an announcer says of the current financial crisis, ''This crisis would be Obama's first crisis -- in this chair.''
 The effort also includes what Republicans said would be an ambitious automated telephone get-out-the-vote operation, with calls already going out in 10 states. Some appeals invoke Mr. Obama's passing dealings in Chicago with William Ayers, a member of the Weather Underground radical group in the 1960s.
 In Colorado, New Mexico, Ohio, Pennsylvania and several other states, the party was running a robotic call in which a man says he is calling because ''you need to know that Barack Obama has worked closely with domestic terrorist Bill Ayers, whose organization bombed the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, a judge's home and killed Americans.'' (It does not say that Mr. Obama, in fact, worked with Mr. Ayers, now a professor of education, on two nonprofit boards.)
 Mr. Obama is preparing to announce his September fund-raising figures in the next three days, with several top contributors saying the tally is estimated at more than $100 million. The campaign is already so heavily invested in television advertising that it is having serious problems finding open spots to place more commercials. The fund-raising has so exceeded its projections, aides said, that the campaign decided to take the rare step of buying time on network television, including a half-hour informercial in prime time across several networks later this month.
 For Mr. Obama, complacency has become a critical worry. E-mail alerts and text messages will be sent in the coming days to re-energize supporters. With that in mind, he intensified on Thursday his criticism of Mr. McCain, amplifying the arguments that he had made in the debate instead of simply ignoring his rival.
 ''We don't take anything for granted,'' said Mr. Obama's chief strategist, David Axelrod. ''We've been up and down and sideways over these past two years. We have to be ready for anything. We're not going to let up for one week.''
 Mr. Obama admonished his supporters on Thursday not to grow overconfident about his recent surge in crucial electoral battlegrounds and national polls, making public a worry he has privately been raising for more than a week with his circle of advisers. 
 ''For those of you who are feeling giddy or cocky or think this is all set, I just have two words for you: New Hampshire,'' he told top contributors at a fund-raising breakfast in Manhattan. ''I've been in these positions before, when we were favored and the press starts getting carried away and we end up getting spanked.''

HEADLINE: A Relieved California Finds Lenders in Credit Markets

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
California has managed to borrow $5 billion in the credit markets, the state treasurer announced Thursday, averting a severe cash shortage that could have led to service cuts and layoffs. But more fiscal troubles loomed on the horizon here.
 Two weeks ago, as the markets plummeted and Congress scrambled to act, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger served notice on the United States Treasury Department that the state might need a $7 billion emergency loan to pay its bills if the bond market did not come through.
 But on Thursday officials were rejoicing at a better-than-expected reception to the sale of the state's ''revenue anticipation notes,'' essentially short-term loans to tide it over until its spring tax collections refill coffers. 
 While the state, one of the world's biggest economies, initially planned to seek $4 billion, it ended up with $5 billion, a result of both the loosening market and a sales pitch that included Mr. Schwarzenegger in radio advertisements urging people to invest in the state, said Bill Lockyer, the state treasurer. 
 ''I think people thought it was a safe place to put their money,'' Mr. Lockyer said. The state plans to seek the remaining $2 billion of the $7 billion needed at a later date.
 Still, the credit market for state and local governments remained largely sluggish, a possible bad sign for the kind of long-term lending that finances roads, bridges and other large projects.
 ''There is no real sense the market is dramatically better,'' said Matt Fabian, managing director of Municipal Market Advisors, an independent consulting firm, who saw the California sale as something of an anomaly. ''It may get a little better, but this is a long-term condition.''
 Because of the economic downturn, moreover, California must still contend with a shortfall of about $1 billion it expected in revenue from sales, real estate and corporate taxes. Analysts project that the hole could reach more than $3 billion.
 California is not alone. South Carolina legislators on Thursday were planning to use grant and Medicaid money and spending cuts of up to 15 percent among state agencies to fill a half-billion dollar hole in the state budget. Cities, too, are rebalancing the ledger. The Dallas school district on Thursday laid off 375 teachers, 3 percent of its work force, to help patch a $84 million deficit.
 Nonetheless, California and its finances are always watched closely as a barometer of the nation's economic health.
 Mr. Schwarzenegger, a Republican, and legislative leaders have said they will work together to resolve the budget problems, though they have a history of contentious negotiations. The $103.4 billion budget was adopted 85 days overdue because of disagreements over closing a $15 billion deficit.
 They are likely to battle anew over raising taxes, cutting spending or both, and in interviews Thursday Democrats and Republicans were staking their turf. Mr. Schwarzenegger, who plans to meet again with legislative leaders next week, is widely expected to call a special session of the Legislature, most likely some time after the presidential election.
 The Assembly speaker, Karen Bass, and the Senate president pro tem, Don Perata, both Democrats, said they did not see how the state could resolve its problems without considering at least a temporary expansion of taxes.
 Mr. Perata said he would push for expanding the sales tax to goods and services that are not taxed, like health club membership fees. Republicans who oppose new taxes, he said, will have to identify which services to cut, since several billion was already cleaved in the last budget.
 ''They are going to have to put on the table what programs they want to cut,'' Mr. Perata said, pointing to prisons and education as two expenditures most politicians would be loath to cut. ''Those are the two services we spend the most money on. They can no longer have it both ways.''
 Republicans were just as defiant, saying that it was time to make hard choices but that tax increases would only harm the wobbly economy.
 Dave Cogdill Sr., a Republican who is the Senate minority leader, said, ''I think we have a huge challenge ahead of us.''
 ''We definitely have to go back to the budget,'' Mr. Cogdill said, ''and see where we can achieve the greatest savings and look for ways to get there outside of tax increases.''
 He suggested that the sale of underused state land could help raise revenue, and did not rule out cuts to prisons or education, something powerful unions have often defeated. ''I think they have to be looked at,'' Mr. Cogdill said.

HEADLINE: Russian Billionaires Still Like Valuable Art

BYLINE: By SOPHIA KISHKOVSKY; Compiled by DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
As an economic crisis fed speculation about the stability of the art market, Russian billionaires were spotted this week at Moscow previews of top works scheduled for auction. Sotheby's and Christie's brought works worth nearly $500 million to Moscow, including examples by Degas, Kandinsky, Picasso, Francis Bacon and Andy Warhol. At least two billionaire collectors, Mikhail Fridman and Pyotr Aven of the Alfa Group, were among those who attended Sotheby's Champagne-reception preview on Wednesday night. A day earlier Mikhail Kamensky, the general director of Sotheby's for the former Soviet republics, said he was optimistic that the Russians might come through at the auctions, scheduled for this month in London and early November in New York. ''The behavior of Russian buyers doesn't always fit into the standard Western rules and habits,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Southwest Has First Loss in 17 Years

BYLINE: By MICHELINE MAYNARD

 BODY:
Southwest Airlines has long been the envy of the industry for its foresight in arranging contracts to lock in jet fuel prices. But its strategy may have backfired now that oil prices have dropped.
 Southwest Airlines said Thursday that it lost $120 million in the third quarter, its first quarterly loss in more than 17 years, because of a noncash charge to write down the declining value of its hedging contracts.
 The airline took a one-time charge of $247 million, reflecting the decline in oil prices, which hit record high levels in July. The last time Southwest lost money was in the first quarter of 1991. 
 Without the charge, Southwest said it would have earned $69 million. It had record operating revenue of $2.9 billion, up 11.7 percent.
 ''It's like you can't win,'' said Betsy J. Snyder, an industry analyst with Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. ''People bother you when you don't hedge, and when you do, and prices go down, you get hit.''
 Another airline, Continental, said Thursday that it had posted a third-quarter net loss of $145 million, not including extraordinary items. Continental earned $241 million in the period a year ago.
 On Wednesday, Delta Air Lines reported a net loss of $26 million for the quarter, while American Airlineslost $360 million.
 The losses at the four big airlines underscored the difficulty of the carriers this summer in maneuvering through record oil prices. The price of oil peaked at about $145 a barrel in July, and fell below $70 a barrel Thursday. That news lifted airline stocks. Southwest rose 93 cents, to $12.49, while shares of Continental rose 22.6 percent, to $15.75.
 After prices spiked this summer, many airlines cut flights and routes, grounded aircraft and imposed fees for features that used to be included in the price of a ticket, like checking bags, booking trips with frequent flier miles and even beverages.
 Executives hoped the steps, coupled with higher ticket prices, would improve results in the fourth quarter and next year. But they now are facing the uncertain economy, which could keep travelers off planes. ''Economic downturns are going to create less travel, that's true whether domestically or internationally,'' Lawrence W. Kellner, the chief executive of Continental, said in a conference call Thursday. ''This looks to be a global downturn, not just one in the United States.''
 Gary C. Kelly, the chief executive at Southwest, added that his airline was concerned about the volatility of fuel prices. 
 ''I don't think anybody really knows where fuel prices are going in the next three months,'' Mr. Kelly told analysts. ''All I have to do is look back at the last three months and the three months before as evidence of that.''
 Throughout the decade, Southwest has aggressively purchased contracts to guarantee the price of fuel. It has contracts covering part of its fuel purchases through 2012, and has begun buying contracts for 2013. 
 In past quarters, Southwest has booked millions of dollars in gains because it paid far below market price for fuel. The practice seemed especially prescient earlier this year, when fuel prices nearly doubled compared with 2007.
 At the end of the second quarter, Southwest's contracts, which stretch through 2010, were worth $6 billion. But at the end of the third quarter, the value of the contracts had dropped to about $2.5 billion, and have since fallen to $1.1 billion, Southwest executives said Thursday.
 The contracts' value reflected the drop in the price of oil. But under federal accounting rules, Southwest must exclude about 10 percent of its future contracts, and value them at current prices. 
 When fuel prices are rising, the practice can be beneficial. Indeed, Southwest booked a $511 million gain in the second quarter because of favorable swings in its contracts. But when prices drop, a company is required to take a charge reflecting the decline.
 Southwest said it still had hedging contracts in place for 85 percent of the fuel it planned to purchase in the fourth quarter; 75 percent of its 2009 fuel; and 50 percent of the fuel it planned to buy for 2010. 
 Mr. Kelly said he was not discouraged by the loss. ''Over all, declining fuel prices are a very good thing for an airline including Southwest Airlines,'' he said in an interview.
 Southwest did not anticipate, Mr. Kelly said, that any future swings in oil prices to be as significant as in the second quarter. But analysts are still concerned about the industry's outlook.
 Last week, Standard & Poor's cut its rating on Southwest from A minus to BBB plus, still the best among the carriers. Mr. Kelly said he was pleased with the airline's overall performance, and said he expected it could maneuver through the economic crisis. 
 ''The world is on fire, and we're in pretty good shape,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''We're going to fight hard to blast through the headlines.''

HEADLINE: Overseer Of Banks In Europe Shifts Focus

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
The European Central Bank was created with a single mandate: keep inflation in check. But the bank has transformed itself into a crisis manager over the last month as it has battled to keep Europe's financial system and integrated economy intact.
 The bank has sublimated its usual obsession with inflation -- at least temporarily -- cutting interest rates once, with more reductions in the pipeline. It is lending ever more cash to struggling banks. And, most noteworthy, the central bank's president, Jean-Claude Trichet, has waded into the highly politicized question of recapitalizing European banks as it became clear that little else would forestall a further disintegration of confidence in financial institutions. 
 ''For the national governments, this was a task they would just have soon let alone,'' said Gernot Nerb, head of sector research at the Ifo Institute, a research center based in Munich. ''The E.C.B. played a role as a kind of mediator in Europe.''
 The bank's architects could hardly have imagined such a role when it began its work 10 years ago. But the collapse of Lehman Brothers on Sept. 15 turned Wall Street's traumas into a global financial crisis and pushed the central bank to act much more like the Federal Reserve, with its forward-leaning style of managing financial challenges. 
 With a European credit crisis unfolding, even central bank officials worried about inflation decided that Europe faced a more immediate threat. As a result, many analysts expect the bank to cut its benchmark rate by half of a percentage point when it meets in early November, as it did on Oct. 8 in conjunction with several other central banks. Many expect rates will go lower still next year.
 Critics, of course, accuse the central bank of being behind the curve and not acting faster to cut rates at the first signs of slowing. ''I see them as someone who had a loss-making position for a long time and finally closed it out,'' said Thomas Mayer, chief Europe economist at Deutsche Bank in London. ''They didn't panic -- they just made the wrong judgment.''
 Lately, the bank has moved speedily, as when the currency swap market in London dried up after Lehman filed for bankruptcy, for instance. The swaps allow European banks to convert the euros or pounds they receive from their central banks to meet dollar-denominated liabilities, liabilities that were often linked to the United States mortgage market.
 Within two days of Lehman's collapse, the central bank's decision-making body, which comprises 6 people in Frankfurt and 15 national central bank governors, approved a plan proposed by the Fed. Instead of ad hoc injections of cash, the central banks agreed on Sept. 17 to provide $180 billion in overnight dollar loans and to do it as long as necessary.
 After the operation began, Mr. Trichet lauded the ''intimate cooperation'' that allowed central banks to carry it out smoothly, while playing down any systemic risk within banks.
 ''We have a responsibility, as regards liquidity providing,'' he said. ''We have no responsibility as regards the solvency issue that might emerge here and there.''
 The ''here and there'' case-by-case approach to ensuring solvency proved inadequate. 
 Government officials arranged rescues for Fortis, a bank based in Brussels, and Hypo Real Estate, a German lender. With investors pounding other bank stocks, Mr. Trichet began to speak obliquely about the need for elected officials to act more expansively. 
 ''In exceptional cases, where financial stability is at stake and we have done everything we can in terms of providing liquidity,'' he said at the bank's meeting on Oct. 2, ''it is important that governments also make the appropriate decisions.''
 Two days later, he joined a meeting of major European countries in Paris and made the case for a broader effort. He knew emulating the United States by having a single bailout fund was impossible because Europe did not have a federal budget.
 Officials at the central bank knew that every modern banking crisis had ended with a sovereign guarantee for banks in some form. They had studied the Scandinavian approach -- where governments rescued banks after bad real estate loans in the early 1990s by recapitalizing them and buying shrunken assets.
 But the idea ran aground at the meeting. Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany was wary of financing rescues of non-German banks. A Dutch proposal for each country to commit to providing the equivalent of 3 percent of gross domestic product went nowhere. 
 Financial markets fell sharply the next Monday, Oct. 6, a prelude to a long, scary week on exchanges worldwide.
 By then, after signaling its willingness to cut interest rates, a landmark, the central bank was ready to move. The Fed had long wanted to pursue a coordinated rate cut, insiders said, but in the collegial world of central banking, it could not pressure the bank.
 What the Fed could do, when a globally coordinated rate cut was announced on Oct. 8, was communicate the decision in European terms, emphasizing that the situation with banks had ''diminished further the upside risks to price stability.''
 On Sunday, Oct. 12, Mr. Trichet joined the heads of state from the euro zone for the second gathering in a week in Paris. The falling markets had brought the Germans around. Following the lead of the British prime minister, Gordon Brown, the leaders hashed out rescue packages, which Mr. Trichet and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France called for a week earlier.
 On Tuesday, the central bank made good on its earlier promise to provide unlimited liquidity at its new rate of 3.75 percent, and lent 185 billion euros, or about $250 billion, to banks.
 Europe still faces an economic downturn. But ''it's now conceivable that the financial crisis may be terminated more quickly,'' said Charles A. E. Goodhart, a former top official at the Bank of England.
 ''We had an adverse shock,'' he added, ''but now we've had a policy response that looks like it might work.''

HEADLINE: Rivals' Visions Differ on Unleashing Innovation

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD and CORNELIA DEAN; Kenneth Chang contributed reporting.

 BODY:
For decades, the United States dominated the technological revolution sweeping the globe. The nation's science and engineering skills produced vast gains in productivity and wealth, powered its military and made it the de facto world leader.
Today, the dominance is eroding. In 2002, the nation's high-technology balance of trade went south, and it never came back. By 2007, the annual gap between high-tech exports and imports had grown to $53 billion. The gap this year is expected to be the largest ever -- approaching $60 billion.
Both presidential candidates, in their careers and in their campaigns, have made detailed arguments for how the nation should deal with technology rivals, sharpen its competitive edge and improve what experts call its ''ecology of innovation.''
Yet their visions are strikingly different. They diverge mainly on the appropriate role for the federal government in education, in spending on research, and in building, maintaining and regulating the complex infrastructure on which innovation depends. The visions both face tough questions on their viability amid the nation's deepening financial crisis. 
Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee for president, seeks to encourage innovation by cutting corporate taxes and ending what he calls ''burdensome regulations'' that he says inhibit corporate investment. But Mr. McCain has also repeatedly gone up against business if he sees a conflict with national security, for instance, in seeking to limit sensitive exports.
In Senator Barack Obama's view, the United States must compete far more effectively against an array of international rivals who are growing more technically adept. Mr. Obama, the Democratic nominee, looks to the federal government to finance science, math and engineering education and the kind of basic research that can produce valuable industrial spinoffs.
The personal styles of the candidates also contrast. Mr. McCain says his leadership of the Senate commerce committee has versed him in technology issues, but he also jokes about his ignorance of personal computers and e-mail. Mr. Obama, an avid BlackBerry user, commenced an aggressive drive for campaign donations over the Internet.
Mr. Obama embraces the theory of evolution and argues that the teaching of intelligent design and other creationist ideas ''cloud'' a student's understanding of science. While Mr. McCain says he personally believes in evolution, he has also said children should be taught ''all points of view.''
Mr. McCain has written five books, starting in 1999, but none discuss in any detail how the nation might respond to technical rivals -- a central theme of Mr. Obama's second book, published in 2006. Mr. Obama posted a detailed set of technology proposals on his Web site late last year; Mr. McCain did so in recent months.
It remains to be seen how the candidates would pay for their proposals.
At the request of The New York Times, the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a nonpartisan research group in Washington, estimated the annual costs of the plans and put Mr. Obama's at $85.6 billion and Mr. McCain's at $78.8 billion, excluding his proposed reductions in corporate taxes.
''The pressures of an unfolding fiscal crisis make these priorities recede on the list of what politicians want to do,'' said Robert Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office from 1989 to 1995.
Nevertheless, there is wide agreement among economists and other experts that the capacity to innovate is central to growth, quality of life and success in the global marketplace -- a point on which the candidates agree.
''If we don't have an innovation agenda, if we don't invest in science research, if we don't provide encouragement for our kids to pursue careers in math and science, I don't see where our country can go economically in the future,'' said John Edward Porter, a Republican former congressman who is the board chairman of Research!America, an advocacy group.
Several experts faulted both campaigns for failing to give the innovation issue higher visibility, despite their many plans and proposals.
''I understand the immediate pressures and vicissitudes of elections,'' said Charles M. Vest, president of the National Academy of Engineering and former president of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''But I'd like to see them raising the discussion on this, which is absolutely fundamental to the future of jobs and the economy.''
Restoring the nation's competitive edge is urgent, said Norman R. Augustine, a former chief executive of the aerospace giant Lockheed Martin who led an influential innovation study by the National Academies.
''If we don't wake up,'' Mr. Augustine said in an interview, ''there's a high chance that the generation of children we're leaving behind will have a much lower quality of life.''
McCain as Committee Leader
The golden age of American invention began after World War II, when the government and industry poured big money into research and produced advanced goods like the transistor, the laser, new drugs, fiber optics, new kinds of jets and spacecraft, modems and the desktop computer. All were exported in vast quantities.
Signs of trouble appeared in September and October of 1995, when the nation registered its first negative balances of trade in advanced technology goods, according to the Foreign Trade Division at the Census Bureau.
In 1997, Senator McCain, of Arizona, became chairman of the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation, beginning a tenure that, with an interruption in 2001 and 2002, went until early 2005.
Though often approving of business and deregulation, he could reverse course if the issue impinged on what he saw as national security. An early initiative of his sought to restrict American exports of certain high-tech goods, even as the Clinton administration pushed for trade liberalization.
''It's critical that safeguards are in place,'' he said in opening a 1998 hearing on missile and satellite exports to China. Later, Republicans charged the Clinton administration with dangerous irresponsibility in allowing the Chinese to import high-performance computers. Getting the export issue right, Mr. McCain said at a hearing in 2000, is ''one of the greatest challenges of our time.''
The drive helped tighten export regulations. But technology analysts faulted the attack as political and the tightening as unnecessary.
James A. Lewis, an export specialist at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, wrote in 2001 that the new system ''expends enormous resources on trivial and unimportant security risks'' and threatens to damage important sectors of the economy, like the defense industry. The Republicans ''closed off space exports,'' he added in an interview this month. ''So, many countries started their own space programs to get around the export controls.''
Domestically over the years, Mr. McCain's committee sought to spur things like Internet development, the private space industry and the commercial licensing of federally owned inventions.
But in 2002, for the first time, the nation registered negative balances of trade in advanced technology goods for a whole year. ''Time to wake up,'' Representative Donald Manzullo, an Illinois Republican, said as he led a hearing in July 2003 on preserving the defense industrial base.
Mr. McCain, who held no hearings on the issues, did push for new innovations. For instance, he introduced a bill in 2005 to limit heat-trapping gases that sought to spur the development of green technologies.
A few months later, the National Academies issued its influential report ''Rising Above the Gathering Storm.'' The academies, the nation's most eminent scientific and engineering organization, called for an urgent effort to strengthen American competitiveness.
The report said industries like chemical, semiconductor and automotive were growing in other countries while comparable American efforts atrophied. The patent office issued most of its information technology patents to foreigners. The United States ranked 17th among industrialized nations in high-school graduation rates, and the country had become ''a net importer of high-technology products,'' many from China.
The report added that corporations were cutting back on basic research and eliminating in-house laboratories.
Among other things, it proposed that the government finance 10,000 scholarships for math and science teaching careers and 30,000 scholarships for college-level study of science, math and engineering; increase the basic research budget by 10 percent a year for seven years; and establish programs to make broadband available nationwide at low cost.
Representative Sherwood L. Boehlert, a New York Republican who was chairman of the House science committee, praised the report at a hearing and said, ''Complacency will kill us.''
Outlook in Obama Book
In October 2006, Mr. Obama, who had been elected to the Senate from Illinois two years earlier, published his second book, ''The Audacity of Hope: Thoughts on Reclaiming the American Dream.'' He wrote of visiting Google headquarters in Mountain View, Calif., where, among other things, he saw a map of the world with lights showing where Google searches were going on. Swaths of Africa and South Asia were dark. But so were portions of the United States, he wrote, where ''thick cords of light dissolved into a few discrete strands.''
Many of the engineers Mr. Obama met at Google were from Asia or Eastern Europe. ''As far as I could tell, not one was black or Latino,'' he wrote. His guide told him that finding American-born engineers of any race was getting so hard that American companies were setting up shop abroad, in part for access to talent.
America, Mr. Obama wrote, cannot compete with countries like China and India simply by cutting costs and shrinking government. ''If we want an innovation economy,'' he added, ''one that generates more Googles each year, then we have to invest in our future innovators -- by doubling federal funding of basic research over the next five years, training 100,000 more engineers and scientists over the next four years, or providing new research grants to the most outstanding early-career researchers in the country.''
He acknowledged that his plan would cost about $42 billion over five years -- ''real money, to be sure, but just 15 percent of the most recent federal highway bill.''
The next year, Mr. Obama joined other senators to introduce a bill that built on the recommendations of ''The Gathering Storm.'' It eventually drew 69 co-sponsors from both sides of the Senate aisle; Mr. McCain was not among them.
Mr. Obama then offered amendments to the bill intended to increase federal support of science education, particularly among women and underrepresented minorities. ''If we do not tap the diversity of our nation,'' he said on the Senate floor, ''we will diminish our capacity to innovate.''
The Senate passed the bill 88 to 8. Mr. McCain abstained. President Bush signed the bill, the America Competes Act, into law. But Congress has yet to finance its programs, estimated to cost about $43 billion for the first three years.
Candidates' Platforms
Mr. McCain and Mr. Obama acknowledge the importance of scientific research. The two men, for instance, advocate making research and development tax credits permanent. They would move the presidential science adviser back into the close orbit of the White House, a position it occupied until 2001, and they support the human exploration of space.
Though their approaches differ, both call for changes in the operation of the patent office, agree that access to broadband must be expanded and advocate steps to encourage technically trained foreigners to enter and stay in the United States.
But Mr. Obama looks to encourage basic research with infusions of federal cash. Mr. McCain says easing regulatory and tax burdens will encourage private spending on research. (Experts say industry now tends to focus on near-term applications, while government finances more basic research that has greater breakthrough potential.)
Mr. Obama has proposed doubling federal financing for basic research in physics, life sciences, mathematics and engineering over 10 years. He has promised to review export rules he calls outdated and sees as having ''unduly hampered the competitiveness of the domestic aerospace industry.''
By contrast, even before the current economic crisis, Mr. McCain proposed freezing, at least initially, almost all discretionary federal spending -- a budget category that includes federal research efforts.
And he makes hay on the stump by citing, as an example of wasted money, a study of the DNA of grizzly bears in Montana, wondering aloud why anyone would think bears were involved in paternity suits or criminal activity. (In fact, the project, undertaken by the United States Geological Survey, intended to find ways of estimating the region's population of grizzlies, endangered in the lower 48 states.)
The McCain campaign has said he will encourage corporate research by reducing the capital gains and corporate taxes and promoting ''conditions favorable to investment.'' In response to a survey by Science Debate 2008, a private group that tried to arrange a debate on science issues, he cited ''burdensome regulations'' as inhibiting innovation in the United States and said he would work to remove them.
''I am uniquely qualified to lead our nation during this technological revolution,'' he said in the survey response, pointing to his Navy experience with advanced technologies as well as his leadership on the Senate commerce committee. ''Under my guiding hand,'' he added, Congress developed a wireless spectrum policy that prompted the rapid rise of mobile phones and Wi-Fi technology.
Seeking to reduce the government's role in choosing technologies and to increase that of entrepreneurs, Mr. McCain has now proposed federal sponsorship of a $300 million prize to encourage the development of a revolutionary new battery for electric cars.
Mr. Obama supports expanding research on human embryonic stem cells. The research is regarded as a promising avenue toward novel treatments for serious diseases. But because such research involves destruction of early stage human embryos, opponents of abortion rights oppose it. Mr. Bush severely restricted the work in 2001.
Mr. McCain has voiced support for this research, but he now adds that he hopes it will soon be unnecessary to use these cells. In his response to the Science Debate 2008 questionnaire, at sciencedebate2008.com, Mr. McCain said the nation should refuse ''to sacrifice moral values and ethical principles for scientific progress.''
Mr. McCain's campaign did not respond to repeated requests for information. According to the journal Science, he has ''no formal structure'' for seeking science advice. It reports that Douglas Holtz-Eakin, a former economic adviser and head of the Congressional Budget Office under Mr. Bush, serves as Mr. McCain's ''point man'' on science, having been in touch with experts on climate, space and ''science in general.''
On the other hand, Mr. Obama established a science advisory committee led by Dr. Harold Varmus, a Nobel laureate who is president of the Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. Dr. Varmus said the group's leaders communicated almost daily with the campaign's policy leaders. And this month, the campaign announced that 61 American Nobel laureates in science had endorsed Mr. Obama. (When Martin Chalfie, a Columbia biologist, learned last week that he had won the Nobel Prize in chemistry, he said one of the first things he did was to call one of the 61 to ask how to add his name to the list.)
Dr. Varmus acknowledged that finding the money to pay for the Obama innovation agenda ''is not an easy question.'' But he said Mr. Obama would focus on federal spending on high priority areas ''and among the things he mentioned as being central to economic recovery are science and technology.''
Experts agree that the immediacy of the financial crisis is overshadowing the innovation debate and predict little headway until a new president has settled into office and confronts budgetary realities.
''The problem,'' said Mr. Boehlert, the former chairman of the House science committee, who left Congress last year, ''is that it takes an immediate investment that won't pay immediate dividends, and people are looking for an instant fix.''

HEADLINE: Debates Over, Candidates Begin Final Sprint

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and MICHAEL COOPER

DATELINE: LONDONDERRY, N.H. 

 BODY:
With their final debate behind them, Senator Barack Obama admonished his supporters on Thursday to avoid overconfidence and Senator John McCain warned that his Democratic opponent would raise taxes on small-business owners, as the two candidates opened the final chapter of a 19-day sprint to the election.
 ''For those of you who are feeling giddy or cocky or think this is all set, I just have two words for you: New Hampshire,'' Mr. Obama told top contributors during a fund-raising breakfast in Manhattan, alluding to his recent gains in opinion polls. ''I've been in these positions before, when we were favored and the press starts getting carried away and we end up getting spanked.'' 
 With that lesson in mind, Mr. Obama arrived at a rainy afternoon campaign stop here in New Hampshire, a state whose primary he lost nine months ago to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton. The outcome set off the longest nomination fight in the party's history.
 Mr. McCain rallied supporters in Downingtown, Pa., reprising the character of ''Joe the Plumber'' as an example of business owners who he said would be affected by Mr. Obama's tax plan. But even as he was cheered at the rally, questions and scrutiny of the employment and tax records arose for Joe Wurzelbacher of Holland, Ohio, who had met Mr. Obama at a campaign stop on Sunday.
 ''The real winner last night was Joe the Plumber,'' Mr. McCain said, adding: ''He won and small businesses won across America, they won, because the American people are not going to let Senator Obama raise their taxes in a tough economy.''
 Mr. McCain then recounted his version of the encounter Mr. Obama had with the man who is suddenly the most famous plumber in America. He is a worker who would apparently get a tax cut under Mr. Obama's plan, but who also expressed concerns that his taxes would increase if he ever makes enough money to buy his own business and net more than $250,000 a year.
 ''You know what Senator Obama had to say to Joe?'' Mr. McCain asked. ''That he wanted to spread his wealth around, he wanted to spread his wealth. What does that mean? He wants government to take Joe's money and give it to somebody else. His hard-earned dollars! We're not going to stand for that. America didn't become the greatest nation on earth by spreading the wealth; we became the greatest nation by creating new wealth.''
 Here in New Hampshire, Mr. Obama dismissed the criticism from Mr. McCain.
 ''He's trying to suggest that a plumber is the guy he's fighting for,'' Mr. Obama said. ''How many plumbers do you know who's making a quarter of million dollars a year? I have a different set of priorities.''
 Trying to keep his supporters motivated, he added: ''Now, in the closing weeks, John McCain thinks he can make this campaign all about me -- but the truth is, this campaign is about you.''
 Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain were both headed back to New York on Thursday afternoon for the annual Alfred E. Smith charity dinner at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel. In the waning days of the presidential campaign, it will be the second consecutive night -- and likely the last -- that the two rivals will spend time in the same place.
 Both campaigns released new commercials on Thursday, which were made overnight after the debate at Hofstra University on Long Island. Mr. Obama's message sought to tie Mr. McCain to President Bush, charging that his rival would ''keep spending $10 billion a month in Iraq while our own economy struggles -- same as Bush.'' For his part Mr. McCain in his ad distanced himself from the administration, saying ''We need a new direction, and I have a plan.''
 Even as Mr. Obama warned his supporters against overconfidence, he told them he would need their help, not only in the final days of the campaign but also in his administration should he win the election.
 ''Once we're done, there is extraordinary expertise in this room, and we're going to need good advice,'' Mr. Obama told about 120 business executives and other contributors sitting in a gilded room in the Metropolitan Club on Fifth Avenue. ''And who knows, there might be even some of you who decide that you want to spend a little time in government. We're going to need people who can roll up their sleeves and make sure that Washington and Wall Street and the country as a whole are working.''
 In a brief morning speech to contributors, Mr. Obama said the end of the campaign was in sight, but the most the pressing challenges still lay ahead. 
 ''One of the things that I think we have to remember is that we are now 19 days, not from the end, but from the beginning,'' Mr. Obama said. ''The amount of work that will be involved for the next president is going to be extraordinary.''
 While in New York, Mr. McCain was preparing to appear on ''The Late Show'' with David Letterman on Thursday evening, Mr. Obama is set to attend an evening fund-raiser headlined by Bruce Springsteen and Billy Joel.

HEADLINE: In Colorado, Voting by Mail Alters Both Campaign Strategies

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON; Dan Frosch contributed reporting.

DATELINE: FORT COLLINS, Colo. 

 BODY:
The presidential debate had barely ended Wednesday night when Kristin Marshall had her ballot on her lap, pen in hand, ready to vote. Three friends, all supporters of Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee, had their ballots, too. 
 ''Obama's the second one down -- don't accidentally pick the first,'' said Ms. Marshall, 27, a reference to the ballot placement of Senator John McCain, Mr. Obama's Republican opponent, as her living room of Obama supporters erupted in laughter.
 The traditional American vote -- a solitary moment behind a black curtain in a booth, civics in secret -- was never thus.
 With Election Day less than three weeks away, the number of people voting by mail has exploded in Colorado, a closely divided state up for grabs in November. Nearly half of the state's registered voters have requested ballots by mail, compelling the Obama and McCain campaigns to kick-start their get-out-the-vote efforts -- and devise new and imaginative ones. 
 All across the state, the traditional Election Day sprint by campaign workers has changed into a nearly monthlong marathon, made all the more pressing by the tightness of the race.
 Two recent statewide polls suggest a dead heat in Colorado. Both the latest CNN/Time poll and one conducted by Suffolk University in Boston give Mr. Obama a four-point advantage, an edge that falls within each poll's margin of sampling error.
 ''You have to get creative, to find ways to get them to return their ballots,'' said Anne Filipic, the Obama campaign's general election director for Colorado.
 Volunteers for Mr. McCain and other Republican candidates are hand-delivering information packets to 35,000 households in Weld County, east of Fort Collins, that have voters who requested mail-in ballots. The county, traditionally a Republican stronghold, has one of the highest rates of mail-balloting in the state, and is regarded by both campaigns as among a few counties that could tip the state blue or red.
 The Obama campaign made a big effort this week to encourage debate-and-vote parties like the one at Ms. Marshall's home here in Larimer County, another pivotal county with a lot of mail-balloting.
 Mail-in voting has put down its deepest roots in Oregon, Washington and California, but election experts say the significance of Colorado's mail-in voting this year has been amplified because the state is one of the few tossups left on the electoral map.
 Previously, voting by mail in Colorado has been most common in rural areas, where distances make a trip to the polls problematic and Republican voters usually dominate. But the clerk and recorder for Weld County, Steve Moreno, said the Obama campaign, in particular, had embraced the idea of voting-by-mail this year and met with him about how to expand the numbers.
 Ms. Marshall, the debate-and-vote party hostess, said she was voting by mail for the first time partly because the Obama campaign, for which she has volunteered, had pushed it hard as a tool to increase turnout.
 ''I have the time to go wait in line at the polling place, but the person behind me in line maybe doesn't,'' said Ms. Marshall, a graduate student in ecology at Colorado State University. ''They might have only half an hour to wait on line at lunch break, and if they can't get through the line, they may not vote.''
 Statewide, officials said, there are broader reasons for the spike in mail-in voting, a subset of so-called early voting, which also includes voting in advance at polling places. The reasons range from anxiety over the state's voting machines after a scare involving their technical reliability this year, to a state ballot with more issues and referenda on it than any in 96 years. County clerks also pushed the shift with advertising and mailings, hoping to avoid the long lines that plagued polling places in 2004 and 2006.
 ''I like the fact that you can sit down and think about it,'' said Jim Richardson, a 56-year-old retired school teacher and coach who lives in Greeley, about 40 minutes from Fort Collins, in Weld County. 
 Mr. Richardson is the kind of at-home voter who might as well have a target on his back. 
 He is unaffiliated with any party and undecided in the presidential race, and since every campaign and cause can check the county records to see who requested a ballot, his telephone has not stopped ringing. 
 Mr. Richardson said he thought he had received maybe 25 calls, but had not yet been swayed. The candidates' positions on health care, education and the economy will swing his decision, he said.
 Campaign workers and elections experts say that having so many people voting from home alters the chemistry of the election. So far, 1.4 million of Colorado's 3.2 million registered voters have requested mail-in ballots; voters can request them until Oct. 28. (In 2004, about 668,000 voters requested the ballots).
 ''It used to be in the traditional concept of a campaign, there was a persuasion phase -- vote for us and against the other candidate, then a window before Election Day to get out the vote and close the deal,'' said Doug Chapin, an elections expert at the Pew Center on the States, a nonprofit, nonpartisan research group. ''My guess is that in the 21st century, the campaign consultants of greatest value to campaigns are going to be the ones able to predict not just who people will vote for, but when and how.''
 In other closely fought states, mostly in the Midwest and the South, data on mail-in (sometimes called absentee) voters are imprecise, but the numbers seem to be far fewer than in Colorado. 
 In North Carolina, for example, election officials said there had so far been 141,148 requests for ballots by mail. Florida keeps no statewide count, though in Miami-Dade -- the county with the most registered voters in the state -- about 10 percent of registered voters had requested ballots.
 In Nevada, also up for grabs, about 10 percent of voters typically vote absentee, and election officials there said they expected no change from that pattern. Virginia, also in play, requires any voter who cannot come to the polls on Election Day to provide an excuse for a mail-in ballot, a requirement eliminated in Colorado in 1992, and one that tends to limit the mail-in vote. In Ohio, this is the first general election where anyone can request a mail-in ballot without explaining why. 
 In coming up with strategies to get out the mail-in vote in Colorado, both campaigns have focused on making the mail-in voters feel part of a bigger movement.
 The Obama campaign's debate-and-vote parties, for example, were intended to create a feel of civic participation. Republican efforts to hand-deliver packets create a support structure for voters who might feel put off by the lack of Election Day traditions, volunteers said.
 ''We're a friendly face at the door,'' said Jim Kepler, a real-estate broker and Republican volunteer in Greeley who has assisted in delivering the information packets. ''We're there to help them, and they like that.''
 Choosing the moment to sit down to fill in the little ovals indicating one's choices, and how to return the ballot after that, have also become a consideration for some mail-in voters.
 Sue Friede, an office manager in Greeley, said her ballot was ready to go but she did not trust the United States mail, so she said she would hand-deliver her vote for Mr. Obama to the election offices. ''I'm paranoid,'' Ms. Friede said. ''I just feel like every vote is so important this year you can't take a chance.''
 Penny Cecil, the co-owner of a small business in Greeley, and her husband, Bill, are waiting to vote for Mr. McCain and have not even opened their ballots yet.
 ''We're going to wait until closer to the election, because then it still seems more like you're really voting,'' she said.

HEADLINE: After the Last Debate, Voters Weigh In

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''McCain Presses Obama in Last and Pointed Debate'' (front page, Oct. 16):
 The confrontational and argumentative tone of the final debate (as well as earlier debates) may serve to alienate voters rather than provide clear, authoritative and definitive information regarding critical problems facing the country. 
 The accusatory and confrontational remarks between the candidates seemed rather juvenile, and voters have had less opportunity to make well-informed and knowledgeable decisions about the candidates.
 Should the candidates' behavior result in voter apathy and indifference, everyone loses. Harold Langus 
 Poughkeepsie, N.Y., Oct. 16, 2008
 To the Editor:
 To me, the most telling aspect of the last presidential debate was the demeanor of the candidates. 
 Senator John McCain seemed edgy, unable or unwilling to answer the questions that were asked and desperate to make the big score. 
 Senator Barack Obama was cool, on point, prepared to address every question directly. 
 Given the instability in the financial markets and throughout the country, I know that I want the steady hand on the tiller. Mr. Obama was the clear winner.
 Walt Cygan 
 Minneapolis, Oct. 16, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Senator John McCain was so much better in the last debate, and I must admit I had no idea that Senator Barack Obama wanted to tax that much and cut so little in government waste. 
 I was also a little upset at Mr. Obama's condescending smile, all the time acting as if he was so much smarter. He needs to act a little more mature. 
 Laura Taylor
 Ambler, Pa., Oct. 16, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Senator Barack Obama won the debate based on performance. Senator John McCain won on substance and trust. 
 I think Mr. Obama is a socialist who will change the very foundation of our nation. That may appeal to some, but the reality is that socialism does not work.
 Heavily taxing hard-working citizens and businesses because they make more than $250,000 a year and allowing the government to redistribute it to others is just plain Marxist-style socialism. 
 It limits the American Dream by penalizing achievers. It taxes millions of small businesses, and that will kill jobs for the very people it is intended to help.
 Our current financial meltdown is largely the result of giving people something they could not afford. The bad home loans that couldn't be paid off began a financial meltdown and domino effect, and that has left taxpayers paying for this failed socialist scheme.
 Mr. Obama believes in government control. Mr. McCain believes in us -- that we are better managers of our own lives. It's a clear choice. 
 Bonnie O'Neil

 To the Editor:
 Senator Barack Obama clearly showed his strength in leadership with his eloquent temperament, character, compassion and wisdom, and, more succinctly, with his statement, ''I don't think America's youth are interest groups, I think they're our future.'' 
 As the mother of two grown boys, I recognize the value of this priority to the future success of our country.

 Re ''The Final Debate'' (editorial, Oct. 16):
 I have one question for Senator John McCain regarding ''Joe the Plumber'': Do you have a specific economic policy for the country, or are you planning to have a custom-made policy for each Joe the Plumber, because there are about 100 million of them in the country? 
 Prakash Navare 
 Succasunna, N.J., Oct. 16, 2008
 To the Editor:
 There was one extremely telling moment in Wednesday night's debate. During a discussion on free trade with Colombia, Senator Barack Obama said that union leaders are being targeted for assassination in Colombia and that there haven't been prosecutions. 
 All Senator John McCain could do was raise his eyebrows and look down at his notes.
 Eight years ago when Mr. McCain was really a maverick, I had great respect for him. His response in the debate severely diminished that respect. 
 William Sarokin 
 Mount Kisco, N.Y., Oct. 16, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Your editorial refers to Senator Barack Obama's relationship with William Ayers as a ''meaningless acquaintance.'' It is anything but. 
 It does not make the senator a terrorist, nor does it suggest that he shares Mr. Ayers's views. What it does is speak to his judgment in the same manner that his willingness to sit down and negotiate with international tyrants without preconditions is anathema to many. 
 In both cases, he lends legitimacy to outlaws. And that is not meaningless.
 Robert Leonard Raphael
 New York, Oct. 16, 2008
 To the Editor:
 In Wednesday's debate, Senator John McCain clearly thought his condescension to ''Joe the Plumber'' laudable, but I have to wonder how he would like being repeatedly referred to as ''John the Politician.'' 
 If ''John'' had really wanted to demonstrate his respect for ''Joe the Plumber,'' calling him Mr. Wurzelbacher would have been a good place to start.

 Re ''Pressing All the Buttons, McCain Attacks, but Obama Stays Steady'' (news analysis, Oct. 16):
 The third presidential debate only reinforced my impression that the baby boomers need to abandon their obsession with the 1960s and focus on contemporary issues. 
 Bill Clinton was reviled by cultural conservatives for what he did, or did not do, in the 1960s. John Kerry's participation in and opposition to the Vietnam War became a campaign issue more important than the present war in Iraq. And now John McCain wants Americans to be angrier about William Ayers than about the global economic meltdown. 
 As a thirtysomething voter, I'd like to see more concern for the present and the future than for events 40 years in the past. James Monk 
 Houston, Oct. 16, 2008
 To the Editor:
 John McCain said he was hurt by Representative John Lewis's comparison of the McCain campaign's inflammatory rallies to the vile hatred generated in the 1950s and 60s by Gov. George Wallace of Alabama. It appeared to be phony outrage.
 Mr. McCain wasn't hurt enough to rein in Gov. Sarah Palin's absurd comments that Senator Barack Obama has been ''palling around with terrorists'' or tell Ms. Palin to squelch those who are yelling ''kill him'' in reference to Mr. Obama at her rallies. 
 Mr. McCain wasn't hurt enough to stop running the strange, race-coded ads that ask, ''Who is Barack Obama?'' 
 In short, Mr. McCain does not seem hurt enough by the comments of Mr. Lewis -- a man Mr. McCain in August, at a forum on faith, called one of three ''wise people'' he would listen to -- to examine his campaign honestly, admit the truth of Mr. Lewis's comments and change the conduct of his very nasty campaign. John E. Colbert 
 Chicago, Oct. 16, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Fair taxation isn't about ''redistributing the wealth'' -- it's about giving back to the great country that gave you the opportunity to benefit so greatly. 
 It's not about taking money from ''Joe the Plumber.'' It's about making sure that ''Joe's Mega-Plumbing Incorporated'' gives back to the country and the people who gave him:
 Roads and bridges for his trucks to roll on.
 Support for research for his latest plumbing equipment.
 Public education so he can have a well-trained work force.
 Markets so he can raise capital.
 Police and firefighters so his business is protected.
 Health care so the employees who helped him build his business can stay on the job.
 Freedom so that he can build his business creatively.
 If ''Joe'' has been able to become wealthy because of the bounty of America, then he should pay his fair share back to America -- that is patriotic.

HEADLINE: Calder At Play Finding Whimsy In Simple Wire

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
Is art basically glorified child's play, extending into adulthood, through a lifetime, picking up ideas and gaining finesse as it goes? That's one way to think of ''Alexander Calder: The Paris Years, 1926-1933'' at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Few exhibitions have focused so intently on one artist's child within. It's a Peter Pan syndrome show.
 It's also a large show, with a chunky, charming catalog. Yet it feels intimate and light, not to say lightweight. Gallery by gallery, it's as suspenseful and insubstantial as a magic act: what will the artist pull from his sleeve next? The story it tells is like a Kids R Us version of early 20th-century Modernism, with a grown-up surprise at the end.
 Calder didn't start out with ambitions to be an artist; if anything, he was pulled in the opposite direction. He watched his father, a professional sculptor, fret over commissions and struggle with money. So when it came time for college the young Calder chose an engineering school in New Jersey over art school. 
 But of course he was an artist, a natural. He may just not have known at first what that meant. Even as a child he was astonishingly inventive. The tiny figure of a rocking-horse-style bird shaped from brass sheeting is, for economy of form and conceptual daring, one of the more radical works in the show. He made it when he was 11. 
 He made stuff all the time. He was one of those people with nonstop eyes and hands: every scrap of stray matter was a candidate for transformation. Give him some wire, clothespins and a scrap of cloth and, presto chango, you had a bird or a cow or a circus clown: nothing, then something, which is what magic is. 
 There's a hyperactive pace to his early career. While working at engineering jobs after college, he was also drawing like crazy and designing toys. In 1923 he enrolled at the Art Students League to study painting; John Sloan and George Luks were his teachers. At the same time he took on illustrating gigs for publications like The New Yorker and The National Police Gazette.
 His academic drawings from the time are gauche and ordinary. The staying-still-in-a-studio they required obviously cramped his style. Much fresher is the dashed-off, manic-looking magazine work. And his Ash Can School-type paintings of New York scenes -- a drunken party; a trip to the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus -- have a gawky spark of life. Then there are his pen-and-ink drawings of zoo animals. They're in a different category, almost by a different artist, one more relaxed and assured. Often done as one continuous line, they are like an effortlessly sophisticated form of penmanship. So are some of the openwork sculptures of bent and twisted wire that he began to experiment with at this time. 
 In 1926, with all these balls in the air, he suddenly moved to Paris, because motion for him was a stimulant and because he felt that Paris was the hot place to be, which it was. With its crowded cafes, charged thinking, endless talking and jumpy personalities, the city was hyperkinetic. Calder fell in love with it. And, although he continued to return to New York for long stretches, he made Paris his home base for seven years.
 His wire sculpture took off there. Several examples in the form of portrait heads are the first thing you see when you step off the elevator on the Whitney's fourth floor. They're an arresting sight, in a gently wow-inspiring way. Wows were what Calder was after, along with chuckles and satisfied ahs. He was a showman, a performer. ''See what I can do, right before your eyes, without even trying?'' his art seems to say. 
 For his purposes industrial steel wire was an ideal medium. It was cheap, malleable, portable and equally adaptable to precision work and doodling, which to him were almost the same thing. Wire was like three-dimensional ink; it was a means of combining drawing and sculpture in space.
 In the Paris years he used it for portraiture. His first subject was a star he admired from afar, Josephine Baker. She was the toast of the town in the 1920s. One look at film clips of her dancing a semi-nude Charleston tells you why. Calder made five small Baker figures; four are in the show. With their tiny heads, spiraling breasts and long, long single-strand legs, they catch something of the image Baker wanted to project: that of an ethnographic specimen come to irrepressibly self-amused life.
 He made other figures too, of the tennis champion Helen Wills, of John D. Rockefeller playing golf. They are the work of a pop illustrator, clever but nothing special. But for people he actually knew, portrait heads were the form of choice. Of the 18 examples in the show, most depict people Calder had met in avant-garde circles in Paris, including celebrity friends like Edgard Varese, Joan Miro and Alice Prin, the multitasking muse better known as Kiki de Montparnasse. You can see why Calder did these likenesses: they were an attention-getting novelty; they advertised his skill; they gave him a pretext to network. 
 They also look as if they were fun to make. One of the attractive features of Calder's art from this period is its gee-I-could-do-that unpretentiousness. At the same time each is a fabulous little virtuosic feat, abstract but exacting. Set on bases or freely suspended, and casting subtle shadows -- Jennifer Tipton, the theatrical lightning designer, was in charge of illumination -- the portraits have the wit and refinement that will show up again in Calder's first abstract sculptures.
 Refinement is not a quality associated with the famously funky tabletop assemblage known as Calder's Circus. A prime draw of the Whitney's permanent collection, it has rarely been off view since the museum acquired it 25 years ago. But it gets a rethinking here. 
 Up to now it has been exhibited as a compact, one-ring affair with its many tiny handmade figures -- clowns, acrobats, animal trainers and so on -- doing all the varied things they do at once. The show's curators, Joan Simon of the Whitney and Brigitte Leal of the Centre Pompidou in Paris, have separated the components into individual acts meant to be seen as taking place sequentially, a format that corresponds to the way Calder himself presented the work in live performances. 
 You can see him giving one in a 1955 film by Jean Painleve, which is in the show. Calder introduces the figures silently one by one, manipulating them and activating the low-tech mechanisms (cranks, pull-strings, air hoses) that animate their activities. If, like me, you've always found Calder's Circus a little too cute for comfort, the film may change your mind. 
 When at one point Calder slowly and carefully removes layer after layer of hand-sewn costumes from one clown figure until he arrives at what looks like a skeleton, it's hard to known whether you're seeing a circus or a medieval morality play. No wonder the original Paris performances pulled in the savvy audiences they did. Jean Cocteau, Marcel Duchamp and Piet Mondrian were among the many vanguard types who sat on crates and watched with rapt attention. 
 The Whitney show's real shock comes a bit later, though, in the last three galleries, when Calder the polymath entertainer becomes Calder the Modern sculptor. The shift happened almost literally overnight. In October 1930 he visited Mondrian's Paris studio; instantly he became an abstract artist. And for some people Calder starts to become interesting only at this point. No more Kikis and tennis players. Now everything is floating circles and curving lines anchored by balls in space. 
 But two things stayed constant: motion and play. For conservation reasons only one sculpture in the Whitney show is now motorized as intended; others can be seen in action on film. And action is the essence in a piece like ''Small Sphere and Heavy Sphere'' (1932-33), which consists of two suspended wooden balls and, set out on the gallery floor, a wooden box, four wine bottles, a can and a gong. 
 Nothing much, right? Until -- as seen on film -- the balls, attached to a motorized bar, start to move in a slow circle, hitting a bottle, then the can, then the gong. Music! (Varese loved this piece.) Yet move a bottle an inch or two this way or that and the performance changes. Turn on a fan or open a window and you could create a new score. The game Calder is playing is a finely tuned, verging on magical, game of chance. And it really is a game. And it really is play.
 ''Alexander Calder: The Paris Years, 1926-1933'' remains at the Whitney Museum of American Art, 945 Madison Avenue (at 75th Street), through Feb. 15. It will then be at the Centre Pompidou, Paris, from March 18 through July 20.

HEADLINE: World Markets Fall as Investors Weigh Relentless Trouble

BYLINE: By PETER S. GOODMAN

 BODY:
Stock markets plunged anew on Wednesday, nearly wiping out the record gains of Monday and sending another wave of wealth destruction washing over American households.
 The government's rescue of the banks has been widely embraced, but the frenzied selling, which pushed the Dow Jones industrial average down 733 points, underscored how the economy's troubles are too broad to be fixed by the bailout of the financial system. 
 In trading in Asia on Thursday, the markets followed Wall Street's lead. The Nikkei closed down 11.41 percent, or 1,089.02 points, the Hang Seng dropped 1,312.91 points, about 8.5 percent, the South Korean Kospi fell 8.25 percent, the Standard and Poor's/Australian Stock Exchange 200 index shed 7 percent and Taiwan dropped 3 percent.
 Investors are recognizing that the financial crisis is not the fundamental problem. It has merely amplified economic ailments that are now intensifying: vanishing paychecks, falling home prices and diminished spending. And there is no relief in sight. 
 Wednesday's rout began in the morning with the latest evidence of the nation's economic deterioration -- reports showing that retail spending slipped in September and broader signs of a pullback among suddenly thrifty American consumers.
 Selling picked up momentum in the afternoon as the Federal Reserve's chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, cautioned Americans that the bailout would not swiftly lift the economy and that continued weakness was certain.
 ''Stabilization of the financial markets is a critical first step, but even if they stabilize as we hope they will, broader economic recovery will not happen right away,'' Mr. Bernanke said in a speech to the Economic Club of New York. ''Economic activity will fall short of potential for a time.''
 By day's end, the Dow had surrendered most of Monday's 936-point gain, dropping 7.87 percent. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 9 percent, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq was down 8.47 percent. Expectations that a worldwide slowdown will reduce demand for oil pushed prices below $75 a barrel. Signs of improvement continued in the credit markets, making it somewhat easier for companies and states to secure financing, but interest rates remained elevated.
 Mr. Bernanke's remarks -- offered in the sober tones of a man cognizant that a stray syllable may prompt the loss of more billions on Wall Street -- underscored the reality that the economy's troubles go well beyond the financial crisis. The United States and many other major economies are almost certainly headed into a slog through economic purgatory, one that could last many months.
 ''People have focused so much on the immediate financial crisis that they haven't realized how much the real economy is going down, largely independently,'' said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington. ''I don't think there's a way we can get out of this without a full-fledged recession and a lot of people losing their jobs. All we can really talk about is ameliorating it, making sure the people who are hit have support.''
 On Monday, as the Dow posted its fifth-largest one-day percentage gain in history, some investors found quantifiable proof that the crisis was solved. Yet an unpalatable historical detail complicated that idea: The four previous largest percentage gains occurred from October 1929 to March 1933, in the early days of the Depression. 
 Then, it must be noted, the markets swung far more widely than they do in this era, and an epic collapse would still be required to bring the United States anywhere near a comparable depression. 
 Mr. Bernanke, a leading academic expert on the Depression, offered pointed assurances that no repeat of that disaster would unfold on his watch. The Fed stands ready to use all its tools to battle the financial crisis, he said. He exuded confidence that the American economy ''will emerge from this period with renewed vigor.''
 But when? Mr. Bernanke could not say. That uncertainty added to the gnawing worry gripping the economy. 
 ''Ultimately, the trajectory of economic activity beyond the next few quarters will depend greatly on the extent to which financial and credit markets return to more normal functioning,'' he said.
 Strikingly, Mr. Bernanke expressed concern about how huge amounts of capital are increasingly concentrated in a handful of enormous financial institutions.
 ''The real concern that we have is that we have got and developed, in this country, a very serious 'too big to fail' problem,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''And that problem, we've just recognized now in the current situation, how severe it is.''
 It seemed a curious concern for a man whose central bank has worked with the Treasury to engineer a series of shotgun corporate weddings, such as Bank of America's purchase of Merrill Lynch and JPMorgan Chase's acquisition of Bear Stearns -- deals that have further concentrated money in fewer hands.
 Mr. Bernanke's prognosis and the latest carnage on Wall Street lent urgency to the debate over what the government should do now to soften the blow to the economy. 
 In Washington, and on the campaign trail, conversation centers on putting together a second round of so-called government stimulus spending, following the $152 billion unleashed this year via tax rebates to households and tax cuts for businesses.
 Democrats in the House are drafting a roughly $150 billion package of spending measures aimed at spurring the economy, according to senior aides, including aid for states, large-scale construction projects to generate jobs and the expansion of unemployment benefits. Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, the Democratic presidential nominee, is urging $175 billion worth of relief measures.
 The Republican nominee, Senator John McCain of Arizona, has declined to outline his own proposal, though his senior economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, said he is ''open to any measure that genuinely stimulates the economy.'' 
 Republicans on Capitol Hill have emphasized tax cuts for businesses in any stimulus package, a stance that puts them at odds with Democrats, though recent signs suggest greater potential for a compromise.
 ''We need fiscal stimulus,'' said Douglas W. Elmendorf, a former Treasury and Federal Reserve Board economist, and now a fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington. ''The outlook is much darker than it was even a few months ago.''
 The checks the government sent to households last summer appear to have kept the economy growing, but economists are skeptical such a course could work again.
 ''The spend rate will be really low because people are scared to death,'' Mr. Baker said.
 When economists met with House leaders on Monday to suggest a course, the favored means appeared to be aiding state and local governments, whose property tax revenues are diminishing as home values fall. Local governments are a crucial source of employment and social services relied upon by the poor.
 ''The states are taking steps right now that are deepening the recession, through no fault of their own,'' said Jared Bernstein, senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. ''They're forced to either raise taxes or cut services. Neither of those are where we need to be right now.''
 The crisis on Wall Street has sown fears that banks would hold tight to their dollars and starve the economy of capital, preventing businesses from securing finances to hire people and expand. If the bailout succeeds in restoring confidence, that should eventually get money flowing and lift economic activity.
 But regardless of Wall Street's travails, a broader set of difficulties has been taking money out of the economy, putting the squeeze on American households and businesses.
 The economy has lost 760,000 jobs since the beginning of the year, and millions of workers have seen their hours cut, shrinking paychecks just as plunging real estate prices prevent households from borrowing against the value of their homes. 
 In short, American spending power is declining, and this has become a downward spiral: As wages shrink, workers spend less, and that limits demand for workers at the businesses that once captured their dollars. 
 Many economists now assume that unemployment, currently at 6.1 percent, will climb to 9 percent by the end of next year. Some now envision it could reach 10 percent -- a level not seen in 25 years.
 ''At this point, the thing has probably just got to play out,'' said Martin N. Baily, a chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton and now a fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''I don't know that there's anything that we can do to avoid a mild recession. The question is what can we do to avoid a very severe recession.''

HEADLINE: Passions High On Term Limits In City Council

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN and MICHAEL BARBARO; Nicholas Confessore, Jonathan P. Hicks and Sewell Chan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A 14-year-old girl touched off wild applause when she accused Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of buying elections and pleaded with the City Council to ''choose honesty over bribery.'' A political consultant startled listeners when he threatened to smear the reputations of council members who vote to change term limits. Councilman Charles Barron of Brooklyn scolded former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo for his testimony praising Mr. Bloomberg, telling him, to cheers from the balcony, ''You've got a lot of nerve!''
It remains to be seen whether Mr. Bloomberg will persuade the Council to rewrite the term limits law so he can seek a third term next fall, but this much is clear from an extended public hearing at City Hall on Thursday: It is not going to happen quietly.
''Do I have to remove somebody already?'' Councilman Simcha Felder, who chaired the proceeding, yelled at the rowdy crowd. 
Hundreds of people packed the Council chambers for the hearing on the bill, which would allow officials elected citywide and Council members to serve for 12 years rather than 8. The plan has set off intense reaction, mainly because voters approved the two-term limits twice through referendums, and the mayor wants to revise the law through Council legislation, rather than another public vote.
For more than 10 hours, the hearing returned repeatedly to a single point of dispute: Those backing the mayor say the Wall Street crisis creates an extraordinary situation that warrants revising term limits so Mr. Bloomberg can remain in office and manage the city's finances. Those opposed say the economic distress is a convenient excuse for a power grab by a billionaire with contempt for the democratic process.
The city's corporation counsel and several prominent supporters of the mayor testified that the Council was well within its rights to change the law without holding another referendum.
''When you come in here saying it's unethical conduct, you're wrong,'' Councilman Domenic M. Recchia Jr., a Brooklyn Democrat and close ally of Mr. Bloomberg, told the former public advocate, Mark Green. ''This is within our power, and we have the authority to do this within the best interests for our city.''
As the testimony rolled on in the chamber, major developments were unfolding offstage, too. An hour after the hearing began, Tom Golisano, the billionaire owner of the Buffalo Sabres, announced that he would join critics in opposing a third term and was considering a campaign of TV and radio ads to defeat the mayor's plan.
Mr. Bloomberg, who usually delegates the details of the legislative process to aides, personally tried to corral the 26 votes needed in the 51-member Council to pass the measure. He has started calling wavering members to press his case, arguing that the economic trouble requires ''continuity of government.'' A person who was briefed on one of the conversations said the mayor told members fearful of a backlash that if they voted to allow themselves a third term, ''people do forget about things like this.''
Councilman Peter F. Vallone, who said he had spoken with Mr. Bloomberg within the last 48 hours, said the mayor told him it would be too ''distracting and time consuming'' to hold a referendum on his plan.
The mayor's political operation did not take much for granted, shepherding about 50 people into the chamber about two hours before it began, taking up prime seats and holding signs supporting the plan. Several opponents complained that they were not allowed in because it was crowded with the supporters, who declined to speak to reporters.
For the first three hours, the witness list was heavy on political heavyweights, in what amounted to a reunion of winners and losers from elections past. Mr. Cuomo, an ardent foe of term limits, said that even though he did not vote for Mr. Bloomberg, he considered him ''spectacularly well-suited to the task'' of leading the city through financial tumult.
Later came former Mayor Edward I. Koch, the last mayor to serve three terms, who backs the mayor's plan, and Mr. Green, the former public advocate who lost to Mr. Bloomberg in 2001 and opposes the measure.
The Bloomberg administration presented its legal arguments through Anthony W. Crowell, counsel to Mr. Bloomberg, and Corporation Counsel Michael A. Cardozo, the city's top lawyer.
Mr. Crowell praised the partnership between the mayor and the City Council. In comments that sounded as much like a campaign stump speech as testimony before a committee, he ticked off the administration's accomplishments over the last seven years: lower crime, budget deficits that turned into surpluses, rising employment, the transformation of Lower Manhattan and more.
''Crisis has a way of clearing the mind and forcing us to put pragmatism first,'' he said.
Mr. Bloomberg also was supported by several labor leaders. Edward J. Malloy, president of the New York State Building and Construction Trades Council of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said ''unexpected challenges'' meant that the public should be ''allowed to re-elect the mayor, comptroller, public advocate, borough presidents and members of the Council.''
Many others who testified said it was not the mayor's performance that is most relevant, but his attempt to make an end-run around the voters.
Richard Emery, the civil rights lawyer involved in the litigation that abolished the Board of Estimate, praised Mr. Bloomberg, saying that ''the mayor has done an excellent job of elevating the notion of nonpartisan, principled government,'' but that his plan to change term limits without a public vote smacked of self-interest and moral corrosiveness.
''Sitting in the lap of the mayor'' as the process goes ahead will ruin the Council's reputation, he said. ''Either you opt for the principled position -- which is to go back to the people, even though you don't have to -- or you take the self-interested road and put the Council in the position of ignominy it was in the past.''
Still, the day ultimately belonged to the parade of less prominent citizens who made their way to the overcrowded and humid room to get their two minutes, give or take, before the Government Operations Committee.
Rachel Trachtenberg, the 14-year-old singer in a family band, said her family was forced to move to Brooklyn recently after they were ''priced out'' of the East Village, and complained about Mr. Bloomberg's wealth.
''He had to spend $100 million to keep and buy his first two elections, and he will spend another $80 million to buy the next one,'' she said. ''I hope you will choose honesty over bribery and keep term limits as they are.''
Andre Ramon Soleil, a lawyer in Brooklyn and a past Republican candidate for the State Senate, cited Abraham Lincoln, saying, ''You are not just servants but stewards of our sovereign will -- that we in our democracy have a modicum of self-control and that you must respect the will as we have expressed it.''
The committee is expected to pass the bill in the coming days, and a full Council vote could be held as early as Thursday.
Fourteen members are now on record supporting the mayor's plan, 19 are opposed and 18 are undecided. The Council rarely fails to go along with mayoral legislation, and rejection of this measure would be a dramatic political blow for Mr. Bloomberg.
The hearing, at which 150 people spoke, began at 1 p.m. and ended at 11:32 p.m. As the night wore on, people crowded the Council coffee machine to keep alert. At one point, Councilman James S. Oddo, Republican of Staten Island, jokingly suggested that the Council's sergeants-at-arms be directed to order 75 pizzas for the audience -- and send the bill to the billionaire Ronald S. Lauder, who supports the mayor's plan.

HEADLINE: Few Takers So Far as Europeans Make Financial Rescue Packages Available

BYLINE: By CARTER DOUGHERTY; Carter Dougherty reported from Frankfurt and Julia Werdigier from London.

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
Lawmakers in Germany and France gave final approval Friday to huge bank rescue packages, but many embattled European banks were in no hurry to sign up for the government money.
 There were few signs that continental European governments were planning to force banks into a state recapitalization, as the United States and Britain had.
 Many banks are reluctant to line up early for the government funds. Some are wary of the message it might send to financial markets and some worry about limits on decision-making and executive pay. 
 But investors pounded some financial stocks, notably the huge Dutch banking and insurance group ING, seeming to send the message that before the crisis is over more banks would end up with governments holding big stakes in them. 
 ''Some still believe they have sufficient strength and can meet capital ratio requirements through other means,'' Howard Wheeldon, senior strategist at BGC Partners in London, said of the banks. ''Markets seem to doubt that.''
 UniCredit of Italy seized the moment to improve its balance sheet by letting Libyan state investors increase their stake to 4.2 percent, or $1.6 billion.
 Perhaps most surprising to some, particularly after the British and American actions, there appeared to be no European rush to nationalize this week.
 Peer Steinbruck, the German finance minister, hinted strongly Friday that he would focus first on interbank lending guarantees, which take up 80 percent of the 500-billion-euro ($670 billion) German package. The plan also provides money for the government to take direct stakes, but limits the pay of top executives at banks that take cash to 500,000 euros.
 The crisis is ''above all a liquidity crunch,'' Mr. Steinbruck said, explaining why recapitalization would be ''a second pillar'' of Berlin's strategy.
 The French plan calls for up to 320 billion euros ($429 billion) in lending to banks, with 40 billion euros set aside to take stakes in French financial institutions. Michel Camdessus, who led the International Monetary Fund during the Asian financial crisis of the late 1990s, will run the program.
 No German bank has asked for cash in any form under Berlin's plan, the details of which will be hammered out over the weekend. Nor has Mr. Steinbruck, whose ministry will run the plan, insisted they take it, said one bank lobbyist, who requested anonymity because the details were not final.
 But the plan has clearly led German banks to consider all their options, because their British and American counterparts are getting state money to improve their capital positions. Investors and customers around the world are now eager to see that banks have capital ratios well above regulatory minimums, German executives said.
 ''We need to see how things develop, and what happens in other countries,'' said Reiner Rossmann, a spokesman for Commerzbank, a major German lender. ''It's also a competitiveness issue at the end of the day.''
 Analysts said that it could be a short hop from looking at the plan to taking money, especially with governments wanting to make good on their promises to prevent any major bank from failing.
 ''It has become a political matter to make banks overcapitalized so that there is no doubt they can survive a recessionary environment,'' said Simon Adamson, a banking analyst at CreditSights in London. ''And the banks are not in a position to resist.''
 Other European banks were adjusting to the new realities of finance in different ways.
 European cooperative banks said Wednesday they would open a 15-billion-euro credit line to one another for unsecured interbank lending, precisely the market that has dried up during the crisis. Owned by their members and not listed on exchanges, they control about a fifth of the European retail market and want to highlight their private sector solution.
 UniCredit, whose stock was pummeled in recent weeks, turned to three Libyan state banks to increase their stake. In addition to raising their stake to about 1.2 billion euros, the Libyans will buy 500 million euros worth of shares in UniCredit's future offer.
 The Libyan purchase is not the first sovereign wealth to flow into western banks since the financial crisis began, with funds from Singapore, Abu Dhabi and China all having pitched in cash. But it has a particular poignancy -- and circularity -- since Italy agreed in August to pay Libya, a former colony, $5 billion in reparations to compensate for its occupation.
 Shares in ING, the Netherland's biggest financial services firm, lost 27 percent Friday in Amsterdam as investors became increasingly concerned about the company's financial strength. The bank said on Friday that it would post a loss of 500 million euros in the third quarter because of market-driven write-downs.
 The Netherlands has earmarked 20 billion euros to strengthen financial institutions, but Dutch banks so far have shunned their government's bailout fund, according to the financial ministry.
 Goldman Sachs, which rates ING a ''conviction sell,'' said in a note that ING needed to raise more capital, and warned that would be difficult.

HEADLINE: Water and What Else?

 BODY:
As consumers hunker down to cope with hard economic times, an environmental group in Washington has offered a suggestion for saving money: Get your water from the faucet not a bottle. 
 The Environmental Working Group released a report Wednesday that charged that some bottled waters were ''no different than tap water.'' And it found fertilizer residue, pain medication and other chemicals in some major brands. 
 While a lot of bottled water may be as pure as promised in those alluring commercials, the real problem is telling which is which. Public water supplies are regulated by the federal government. Not so for bottled water. The Food and Drug Administration does have some oversight, but bottled water is not very high on their long list of priorities.
 The International Bottled Water Association, which represents most of the industry, has voluntary standards to make sure there are no contaminants. The association encourages (but does not require) bottlers to release pertinent information about what's in their water when consumers call and ask. 
 Among the states, so far only California has set strict standards to make sure carcinogens and other contaminants are not being sold as something purer than that mountain stream usually pictured on the labels.
 Some metropolitan water is better than others, of course, and New Yorkers are proudly unafraid to ask for their four-star tap water at the fanciest restaurants. The federal government requires all public water works to tell consumers once a year what is in their water and whether it meets federal standards. 
 Those public reports are not always as helpful as they should be. Some are printed in ant-size type and best understood by chemists. But at least they are readily available, and the same detail should be publicly available for bottled water. 
 For the extra cost and the promise of added purity -- and the mound of plastic in landfills -- that bottled water should be as good or even better than the less-expensive stuff that comes out of a tap. And consumers should be able to see certified data that prove it.

HEADLINE: In Tough Times, Some Splurges Are Still Allowed

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER

 BODY:
In the last month or so, it has become much harder to take out our wallets without feeling guilty.
No single authority figure has told us not to spend. But people are scared, and that fear is showing up in lower sales on all sorts of big-ticket items, from autos to electronics.
Homeowners had already been feeling poorer, and the devastating investment losses have made thrift a necessity for many people. Saving every extra dollar now seems the most sensible course of action, given predictions of rising unemployment and daily mentions of the Great Depression.
But it's easy to forget a couple of important things. First of all, the vast majority of people in the United States are not going to lose their jobs. Second, most of us work not merely for subsistence but so we can spend money on things and experiences that bring us some form of contentment. 
So let this serve as a reminder that there may be plenty of good reasons left to spend what you earn.
This is not a call to consumer patriotism, a suggestion that we all go shopping for the good of the economy. Instead, I'm merely suggesting that if you're feeling undeserving of anything special at this particular moment, or think you should help perform some sort of collective penance for our national overspending, you may want to cut yourself some slack.
I was reminded of this about a month ago, when I got a note from a man in Ann Arbor, Mich., named Ron Stefanski. At the time, I was writing about reducing financial risk, and he and his family had recently splurged on a 38-foot sailboat and lowered the 20-year-old vessel into the waters of Lake Charlevoix. The question his message raised was whether spending money on a boat was actually wise, and if so, why?
Money was part of what kept the family from buying a boat for years, even though Ron had long wanted one. Until four years ago, Ron's wife, Kay, had been home raising their two boys, Dan, now 15 and Will, 17. Ron, who is 48 years old, is a vice president at Gale, a reference publisher.
''We don't have trust funds for our kids or oodles of discretionary income,'' Ron said. ''So I was the one who kept saying, 'Do we really need to be spending money like this when we need to get money in the bank for college?' ''
But trying to do the math on buying a boat will often end badly, as it will with many large discretionary purchases. Boats depreciate, vacations are over in a week or two, and you probably won't recoup the entire cost of your remodeled patio.
Instead, the Stefanskis came to realize, the boat was an investment in something much more valuable than money. Ron's mother died when he was 16, and his grandmother helped raise him. Three months before his first son was born, his grandmother was murdered in her Detroit home by her newspaper delivery boy.
''When you look at life from that perspective, it's about creating memories,'' he said. ''Because the good moments can be fleeting and they can be peppered with other experiences that you don't want to be as memorable.''
A boat is also an investment in relationships, something that isn't readily apparent until you're on one a lot. Kay, who is 46 and works in textbook sales, helped talked Ron into buying the boat.
''We're getting ready to be empty-nesters, learning how to navigate the space of being alone together, and that's something that's been a little bit sobering,'' Ron said. ''What she helped me to see is that having the boat is an opportunity to connect, to spend time together when the boys are off doing their own thing.''
In fact, Dan and Will have been on the boat a fair bit, too.
''As a teenager, I look forward to doing things that teenagers do, going to parties and hanging out with my friends,'' Dan said. ''But the boat was something I really learned to love.''
That has been an added bonus, given that the boys will soon be in college or away for the summers.
''This was a window of opportunity,'' Ron said. ''And the fact that we have to put the effort into driving up to the lake, it marks the time as untouchable.''
The Stefanskis paid $55,000 for their boat and financed the purchase with a $30,000 home equity line of credit. They earn more than $250,000 each year, though that is a relatively recent development in their lives.
If you make much less and have much less, you may be wondering what all this has to do with you. But not every investment of this sort needs to have a four- or five-figure price tag to be significant.
Perhaps it's buying a better bicycle and taking daylong rides with others (or commuting to work to get in shape and save money on gas). Or it's the fanciest paella pan or pizza stone you can find, which keeps you out of expensive restaurants and at home with friends and family who will appreciate your new skills, the free meal and the conversation.
A sports car probably doesn't qualify here. Nor does a tummy tuck. Instead, it's about investing money tactically in our relationships with one another, building bonds that last beyond ones to any particular employer or a house that we may no longer be able to afford.
For people who find themselves frightened by the possibility of a long, deep recession, well, the Stefanskis know how you feel. Since they bought the boat, the balance in their retirement accounts has fallen by about a quarter. The investments in the college savings accounts for the two teenage boys have hit the skids, and the troubled regional economy means their house in Ann Arbor is worth a lot less as well.
In the last downturn, Ron lost his job two weeks before the Sept. 11 attacks, and it wasn't a great time to be looking for work.
What the family learned then, however, leaves them with no regrets now that they are boat owners, even though their jobs are potentially vulnerable once again.
''If you value family and friendships and experiences, the things that you might lose don't mean quite as much,'' Kay said. ''It puts it all in perspective.''
Ron added, ''Your job as a parent, a friend or life partner is to create memories with each other. That's what we're here for. And I think in that respect, the decision to purchase the boat was a good decision.''

 In the house for the late-night miracle of Fenway on Thursday night into Friday morning were Mystique and Aura on a traitorous visit from the Bronx, along with a longtime Yankees fan in a Red Sox cap, in cahoots with a delirious Nation as the home team staged baseball's greatest postseason comeback in a mere 79 years.
 ''The Red Sox grow on you,'' Jeremy Flug of Denver by way of Manhattan said from his perch along the left-field line where the stands jut out. 
 In the seat next to him, I was inclined to agree, but we'll get to that point in a moment.
 In a less-enlightened stage of baseball fanaticism, Flug might have cursed Rays Manager Joe Maddon for going to sleep on the slumping David Ortiz, not summoning the left-handers J. P. Howell or Trever Miller from the bullpen when the Sox were stirring in the seventh inning, though still trailing, 7-1, before winning, 8-7. Ortiz's three-run homer off reliever Grant Balfour changed the complexion of the night, and maybe the American League Championship Series, if Red Sox A.L.C.S. comebacks in the Champagne-pouring years of 2004 and 2007 are prologue. 
 Long before the Rays' 24 1/2-inning bombardment of Fenway and gallop to the pennant were so spectacularly interrupted, Curt Schilling of Yankee-taunting and bloody sock fame threw out the first pitch of Game 5. Flug recalled being at Yankee Stadium when Schilling pitched with sutures in his ankle -- Game 6 of the 2004 A.L.C.S. -- and the red stains on his Sox sock symbolized Boston's longtime pain and eventual gain.
 ''A cold, rainy night, I'm there with old friends, all of us Yankee fans from the time we were kids, and I'm thinking, I'm not really upset by this; this is great baseball. But I kept my thoughts to myself.''
 In an unsolicited e-mail message months ago, Flug shared with me the story of his recent affections for the Red Sox: He is 47, the father of four school-age sons, the part owner of a manufacturing company in Colorado that builds machinery for the food industry for large-scale processing. He also owns a home on Martha's Vineyard, where his family spends summers. Hence, many ferry trips and drives into Boston, carting a van full of children to Fenway, where he can't remember a bad time.
 I wrote back, saying I had a similar epiphany on Oct. 27, 2004, a cool late night in St. Louis. Minutes after the Red Sox' sweep of the Cardinals was completed, the lower stands were taken over by hundreds of the long-suffering in their caps stitched with the familiar B. And I, a passionate Yankees fan into early adulthood, found myself thinking: good for them, and good for the Red Sox.
 In my return e-mail message to Flug, I noted that as a sports journalist I didn't have traditional rooting interests anymore but had come to admire the Red Sox' core players and their manager, Terry Francona. He wrote back that while he still carried Mickey Mantle's 1988 American Express card in his wallet (long story) and was planning to bring one of his sons to Yankee Stadium for its final weekend, it had become ''harder to warm up to that team.'' 
 It made me wonder how many fans are or should be more like independent voters, more like Flug, making choices based not on unquestioned loyalty, but by what player or team is deemed deserving of their support. I'll say this: when I have driven past the two Yankee Stadiums this season -- and especially since the economy has tanked -- the thought of rooting for a franchise that conspired to wipe precious parkland from a neighborhood of have-nots does not sound tempting.
 Over the past weeks, Flug and I decided to try to go to a game at Fenway together. He flew in from a business meeting in Florida, but it seemed we had chosen a funeral until the seventh inning, when two boisterous brothers in Evan Longoria jerseys up from Florida sensed what was coming and slumped in their seats nearby.
 By the bottom of the ninth, one fan in our section, having serenaded the rookie third baseman Longoria with chants of ''A-Rod,'' took full credit when his throwing error set up the winning run. You never do get away from the old blood rivalry here, but as Flug said as the celebration erupted all around us: ''This was amazing. And you know what? I don't miss the Yankees being in the playoffs.''
 What will Game 5 represent in a historical sense if the Red Sox lose in St. Petersburg? An I-was-there event, the same, I suppose, as those chilly nights at Yankee Stadium in 2001, when the Yankees kept hope alive against the Diamondbacks before falling in Arizona.
 It was Schilling who scoffed at the Yankees' Mystique and Aura then, calling them nightclub dancers, not factors in determining the outcome of a World Series game. Wonder what he thought after Big Papi came alive when everyone thought he and the Sox were dead, when Coco Crisp singled in the tying run with a marvelous 10-pitch at-bat in the eighth and Fenway turned from dulled and quiescent to demonstrative and crazy.
 Until the defending champions are beaten four times, Mystique and Aura wear Red Sox caps.

HEADLINE: Japan Defeats Iran in U.N. Council Vote; Financial Woes Said to Have Hurt Iceland's Run

BYLINE: By NEIL MacFARQUHAR; Graham Bowley reported from New York.

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS 

 BODY:
Japan easily drubbed Iran in the election on Friday for a two-year seat on the Security Council, while the recent financial meltdown in Iceland appeared to have contributed to its loss against Austria and Turkey in the heavily fought contest for two seats reserved for a group of mostly European countries. 
 Some Council members portrayed the lopsided vote against Iran, with Japan garnering 158 votes to Iran's 32, as an international referendum critical of the country's confrontational stance over its nuclear program. 
 ''Its comprehensive defeat -- a thrashing of Iran -- is a very important signal of the whole membership's concern about Iran's actions,'' said Sir John Sawers, Britain's ambassador to the United Nations, a position echoed by the United States. 
 Ambassador Alejandro D. Wolff, the deputy permanent representative for the United States, said, ''Hopefully they will understand that this means that there is no support from the international community for that type of behavior.'' 
 Even the ambassador from South Africa, which is about to give up its two-year seat and has had numerous face-offs with the Western permanent members, thought that worries over Iran's nuclear program, which have led to three rounds of United Nations sanctions, played a role. 
 ''I think it is quite a low number,'' said Dumisani S. Kumalo, the South African ambassador, referring to the number of votes Iran received. ''It may not have helped that it is also on the agenda of the Security Council. I suppose some people may have had difficulty with that.''
 Some countries have worried that Iran could behave as Rwanda did in the early 1990s, when it used its seat to hinder resolutions aimed at curbing violence there.
 The Iranian Mission to the United Nations issued a statement saying that it considered the votes that it received an endorsement for its call to broaden the way the Council is selected. It did not mention the nuclear standoff directly but blamed the ''false propaganda campaign by certain major powers'' as contributing to its defeat. Iran says its atomic work has been aimed solely at producing electrical power, but Western countries fear that Iran's goal is to produce weapons. 
 Iran ran a low-key campaign, arguing that it deserved the spot because it had not been on the Council since 1956, while this will be Japan's 10th time, the last one ending in 2006. Iran issued a small brochure with a bar graph pointing out that difference, along with pictures of Iranian industrial complexes and famous historic sites in the country. It also included a classical Iranian poem that ended, ''If thou feel not for the other's misery, a human being is no name for thee.'' 
 In any case, Japan is considered a formidable rival, given its huge foreign aid program and the fact that it is the second-largest contributor to the United Nations budget behind the United States. It gives $304 million to the organization each year, beyond financing nearly 17 percent of the almost $7 billion in annual costs for peacekeeping, according to the Japanese Mission.
 ''The reality is that nobody expected Iran to prevail against Japan even if there was no nuclear problem,'' said Colin Keating, a former New Zealand ambassador and now the head of Security Council Report, a nonprofit organization that tracks the body. He suggested that 32 votes meant that Iran does have a few committed friends. 
 The 10 nonpermanent seats out of 15 total on the Security Council drew heated competition because the Council is the only body with real power in the United Nations.
 The vote for the seats is one of the few truly electric events on the General Assembly calendar. All 192 member states showed up, a rarity. Each member's vote carries the same weight, and the outcome is often viewed as a kind of popularity contest for a member's standing in the world. Competing nations often drop out rather than live with the embarrassment of receiving few votes. 
 Iceland, too, was facing two formidable opponents in Austria and Turkey. More than 100 nations have diplomatic outposts in Vienna because of its role as a regional headquarters for the United Nations, and Austria has been campaigning for the seat for years. Turkey last held a seat in 1961 and has been seen by other members as working hard to establish peace in a difficult region -- it has been the liaison between Israel and Syria, for example. 
 Many ambassadors said Iceland's effort was dented by the widespread publicity given to its bank failures, especially since there is an informal understanding that it helps for countries that want a seat to be able to contribute generously to aid programs. 
 Iceland's ambassador, Hjalmar W. Hannesson, said he had expected a sympathy vote, saying that 141 countries had promised to vote for his nation. Ultimately, Turkey got 151 votes, Austria 133 and Iceland 87. (A two-thirds majority, or 128 seats, was needed to win.)
 Regional groups often select their candidates beforehand, so Mexico was elected without opposition for the Latin America seat, while Uganda took the Africa slot. In addition to South Africa, the countries that will leave the Council on Jan. 1 are Belgium, Indonesia, Italy and Panama.

HEADLINE: Home Building at Slowest Pace Since 1991

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Government data released Friday showed that construction of new homes declined more than expected in September as builders cut production to the slowest pace since early 1991.
 The Commerce Department reported that construction of new homes and apartments dropped 6.3 percent last month, a much bigger decline than the 1.6 percent decrease that had been expected. 
 The drop pushed total production to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 817,000 units. That is the slowest pace since January 1991, when the country was in a recession and going through a similar painful housing correction.
 The declines last month reflected weakness in many parts of the country. It was led by a 20.9 percent drop in the Northeast, where construction of single-family units dropped to the lowest level on record.
 Construction slipped by 16.8 percent in the West, with single-family building hitting a record low there, too. The Midwest had a gain of 5.6 percent, although that reflected strength in apartment construction; single-family building hit a record low in that region.
 Construction activity in the South was up a slight 0.5 percent.
 Applications for building permits, considered a good sign for future activity, also fell sharply in September, dropping 8.3 percent to an annual rate of 786,000 units, the weakest level since November 1981.
 The housing industry, which enjoyed a five-year boom, is suffering its worst downturn in decades.
 The weakness in housing, in which prices have been falling sharply in many parts of the country, has caused severe economic problems. The government has been forced to rush through a $700 billion rescue package for banks, which have been hit with billions of dollars in losses from soaring defaults on mortgages.
 Banks, worried about their cash reserves and the health of other banks and businesses, have tightened lending, causing credit markets around the world to freeze, stock markets to tumble and anxiety about a global recession to rise.
 Builder sentiment dropped to a record low in October, according to the latest survey from the National Association of Home Builders, which said builder confidence had been shaken by the recent financial market troubles. Builders have been facing tighter lending standards as they try to get financing for new projects.

HEADLINE: A Blow to Poor Women

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Nicholas D. Kristof (''Can This Be Pro-Life?,'' column, Oct. 9) raises an important point about the contradictory policies of the conservative right. 
 For nearly eight years, the Bush administration has worked to restrict abortion around the world, yet its policies that limit access to contraceptives and family planning services have been detrimental to international efforts to curb unwanted pregnancy. 
 Studies have shown that restricting abortion does not reduce its incidence. Rather, it forces women to seek risky procedures that endanger their lives. It is the poorest women who suffer from these policies. 
 The most effective way to diminish the number of unwanted pregnancies, the root cause of abortion, is to increase access to family planning, sex education and contraception. Greater investments in sexual and reproductive health also play an important role in reducing poverty. Yet the United States Agency for International Development's recent restrictions represent another harsh blow to the goals it ostensibly promotes.

HEADLINE: Korea and Adoptions

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Korea Aims to End the Stigma of Adoption and Stop 'Exporting' Babies'' (news article, Oct. 9): 
 That South Korea is working to encourage adoption within its own country is laudable. But even if South Koreans become more accepting of adoptive families, that will not address the underlying issue: the societal prejudice against unwed mothers and their children.
 Too many South Korean women give up their babies because they feel social and economic pressure to do so. Unwed mothers are often shunned by society -- even by their own families -- and get little support from the government. Seventy percent of unmarried South Korean women give up their children for adoption. 
 South Korea is a wealthy democracy. Women there should have a choice whether or not to keep their babies, just as they do in other advanced nations. They need support; when they receive that support, Korean society will ultimately benefit. 
 If a woman chooses not to keep and raise her baby, domestic adoption should be readily available. That South Koreans have started to openly discuss the issue is a positive step, but it is only the beginning.
 Richard S. Boas Wilton, Conn., Oct. 13, 2008
 The writer, an adoptive father of a daughter born to an unwed South Korean mother, is the founder of the Korean Unwed Mothers Support Network.

HEADLINE: Struggling Mervyns to Close Its Doors

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE ROSENBLOOM

 BODY:
A tightening economy has led another retailer in bankruptcy to shut down its operations. 
 Mervyns, the California-based department store that filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in July, announced Friday that it planned to hold going-out-of-business sales at its remaining 149 locations. 
 The move comes after Linens 'n Things, the home goods retailer that filed for bankruptcy protection in the spring, announced on Tuesday its own plans to liquidate.
 The collapse of the chains comes after a dismal back-to-school shopping season -- generally the most important time of the year for retailers next to Christmas -- that has left the retail industry reeling. The Commerce Department said Wednesday that retail sales sank 1.2 percent last month.
 Unable to return Mervyns to profitability, company executives, along with the board, decided that going-out-of-business sales during Christmas would be the best way to drive traffic to the stores and pay creditors. 
 ''We are disappointed with this outcome,'' John Goodman, the chief executive of Mervyns, said in a statement, ''but the company's declining liquidity position and the extremely challenging retail environment, together with the fact that we have exhausted all other possibilities, requires that we take this action.'' 
 Mervin G. Morris opened the first Mervyns store in San Lorenzo, Calif., south of Oakland, in 1949. 
 ''Although we took a number of steps to improve our financial performance, we were unable to return the company to profitability,'' Mr. Goodman said. ''We appreciate the hard work and loyalty of our store associates, whose continued assistance we will rely upon during our going-out-of-business sales.'' 
 Also on Friday, Liz Claiborne, the clothing house that is trying a turnaround, announced that Michael Scarpa, chief operating officer, would leave the company on Nov. 30. There will be no replacement for Mr. Scarpa; his responsibilities will be divided among the company's senior management team. 
 Andrew C. Warren, chief financial officer, will add the title of executive vice president to his duties. At Liz Claiborne, which owns popular brands including Juicy Couture and Kate Spade, profit for the three months ending July 5 decreased 7.1 percent from a year ago, to $973.7 million.

HEADLINE: Climbing Down The Ladder

BYLINE: By BOB HERBERT

 BODY:
I asked Kim Richardson, who is 59 and lives in a modest ranch house in Rocky Mount, N.C., what she would do if a hearing next month goes against her and she loses her home to foreclosure.
 After a long pause, she said, in a voice faint from worry, ''I don't know. I'll be out on the street, I guess. I don't have anywhere to go.''
 Ms. Richardson, who lives on a pair of monthly disability checks, lies awake night after night, unable to fend off the frightening homeless scenarios that dominate her thoughts. ''I never believed that anything like this could ever, ever happen to me,'' she said. 
 If you believe Ms. Richardson's account, and I do, she was fast-talked into a mortgage that would have been impossible to pay off with her fixed income. Foreclosure would have seemed inevitable. But Ms. Richardson and her current lawyer, Carlene McNulty of Raleigh, N.C., said the figures that would have made it obvious to Ms. Richardson that she couldn't afford the mortgage were deliberately concealed.
 While the news media have been focusing on the banks, brokerage houses and mega-millionaires being buffeted by the ill winds of the financial crisis, the millions of lower- and middle-income Americans sinking toward the protracted hell of destitution are getting very little attention. 
 Older Americans are taking a particularly wicked hit. Analysts at AARP have found that ''Americans age 50 and over represent about 28 percent of all delinquencies and foreclosures in the current crisis.''
 Losing a home to foreclosure is a disaster for anyone. It's a catastrophe for older people. The AARP Public Policy Institute, in a recent report, poignantly explained: ''For Americans age 50 and over, losing a house represents a loss from which there is limited time to recover, and for some, a recovery may be impossible given their age and limited incomes.''
 When Ms. Richardson bought her house in December 2005, she tried to make it clear that she could not afford monthly payments much higher than $500. Fine, she was told. She closed the deal with the understanding that she had a fixed-rate mortgage with monthly payments of $537. Prudent and skeptical, she tried to find out if there were any economic bombs hidden in the confusing mass of paperwork that she was confronted with. 
 ''I had all these stacks of papers at the closing,'' she told me, ''and they were just passing papers back and forth to me, back and forth, telling me to sign. And I kept saying, 'Wait a minute. Wait a minute.' ''
 She was assured that nothing untoward was going on.
 Ms. Richardson did not have a fixed-rate mortgage. Her monthly payment rose, and rose again, eventually passing $800, which she could not pay. There was also a balloon payment provision hidden in the welter of documents, along with other obligations that would not emerge until Ms. Richardson was waist-high in economic quicksand.
 Ms. McNulty, the lawyer, is trying to forestall the foreclosure, while at the same time trying to locate those who, in her view, defrauded her client. Her attempt to hold anyone accountable has been maddeningly difficult. As she explained, the original deal ''was securitized into one of these now infamous trusts.''
 The distress calls from despondent men and women who believed until very recently that they were living the American dream are coming from all over the country. Tova Navarra of Atlantic Highlands, N.J., was waylaid by illness. ''I will end up bankrupt, disabled and bereft of a career,'' she told me. ''I'm wondering if this will become a bankrupt society.''
 After a series of medical setbacks forced her to stop working, Ms. Navarra, 60, watched her standard of living deteriorate step by agonizing step to the point where she was forced to leave her condominium and move into a senior citizens' residence that she currently cannot afford. The condo is in foreclosure, and she is staring at a future with no upside.
 ''The first time you realize that you can't pay the mortgage -- that's the beginning of a very keen panic,'' said Ms. Navarra. ''The medical bills pile up and that's when people start deliberately skipping doses to try to make the medicine stretch out a little more.
 ''You find yourself gradually climbing down the economic ladder, and you start thinking, 'How am I going to survive, and where am I going to go?' I said to myself, 'Oh, my God. I'm going to end up sleeping in my car.' '' 
 Real people. Real suffering. We may be fascinated by Wall Street, and bogus yarns like Joe the Plumber's. But the real story in this country right now is the increasingly dire plight of those heading toward the bottom of that ladder that Ms. Navarra was talking about.

HEADLINE: In Hard Times for Humans, Hardships for Pets, Too

BYLINE: By TINA KELLEY

 BODY:
With all the talk of bulls and bears lately, what's happening to cats and dogs?
 At New York City's main animal shelter, monthly calls to the volunteers who can help people keep their pets through tough financial times doubled, to 225 from 115, between January and September. 
 ''We knew how valuable the program was, but now something like this hits, and people can't afford vet care,'' said Richard P. Gentles, the director of administration services for the shelter, Animal Care and Control of New York City. ''Some can't even afford food.'' 
 Volunteers who work for the shelter's four-year-old Safety Net program provide struggling pet owners with low-cost boarding or pet-training services, food donations, lists of apartment buildings that allow pets, even legal help if a landlord is trying to illegally evict a pet owner. 
 As the country's financial crisis has deepened, more pet owners are asking the shelter for help. 
 Sadie Judge, 50, has been living with friends and relatives ever since she got sick and lost her teaching job at Brooklyn College as well as her apartment.
 ''I kept saying, 'At least I've got my kitty cats,' '' Ms. Judge said. But in early September, without her permission, she said, her roommate's boyfriend took her four cats, Michael, Michelle, Molly and Gunzu, to Animal Care and Control, on East 110th Street between First and Second Avenues. 
 Ms. Judge said that after learning from her niece where her cats had been taken, she was told that she had 24 hours to get them out or they would be put up for adoption. But she had nowhere to take them. She was in tears when she happened to look up and see the Safety Net poster. Within two days, her cats were in two separate foster homes, and she hopes to get them back when she finds permanent housing. 
 Animal Care and Control took in 9.4 percent more pets in the first half of 2008 compared to the same months in 2007. However, in the 12 months that ended in August, 168 fewer dogs were adopted than in the previous 12 months.
 ''Probably because of the crisis, fewer people could make a commitment to adopt,'' Mr. Gentles said. ''It will be a huge problem for us if it continues.'' 
 He said the agency needed to recruit three times the number of new foster homes for pets to keep up with demand, in part because many people who serve as foster petkeepers end up adopting them and leaving the program. 
 The situation is much the same at shelters throughout the country.
 Betsy Saul, founder of Petfinder.com, a national pet adoption Web site, said that smaller shelters simply did not have enough food, while donations were plummeting. A survey conducted by her site found that 57 percent of shelters and rescue groups were seeing a decrease in adoptions.
 ''We're hearing that individuals who are caring for feral cat populations with their own money or small rescue groups are feeding them bread soaked in water now, because there's not enough cat food,'' she said.
 Veterinarians are concerned that pet owners may hold off on medical treatments, like hip replacements, that were more common during flush times, Ms. Saul said. And because research has shown that a typical pet owner starts considering euthanasia once the cost of treating an ill pet surpasses $500, they fear that more owners will make that choice sooner than they have in the past.
 Kristen Levine, president of Fetching Communications, a public relations firm based in Florida that works with the pet industry, says veterinarians are finding that pet owners have become more likely to skip annual checkups to save money, even though early diagnoses can detect illnesses that get more costly over time. 
 ''Some vets are offering special incentives for wellness visits, like a free microchip or free nail trimming, for giving something back to owners for recognizing the importance of preventative health care,'' Ms. Levine said.
 In the worst case, pets become homeless. The number of strays taken in by Animal Care and Control in September increased by almost 300, to 2,902, from last year. As the city's only open-admissions shelter, Animal Care and Control has to euthanize animals after all adoption and foster care resources have been exhausted. Last year, it euthanized 15,768 animals, 55 percent fewer than in 2000.
 At that shelter on Wednesday, two women -- one of them crying -- were surrendering a dog together. They declined to speak to a reporter because they said they were too upset. Nearby, another man was surrendering a stray cat, explaining that someone had dumped it in an alley near his apartment on the Lower East Side. 
 ''If I could keep him I would, but I have three at home,'' said the man, Ted Sterns, the chief stage manager for Merkin Concert Hall on West 67th Street, adding that the cat was trained to use a litter box and seemed to have been a pet. ''Somebody dumped this poor baby out.'' 
 But some people may find that as their savings evaporate, their need for companionship may grow stronger. This weekend at Madison Square Garden, the Mayor's Alliance for NYC's Animals will be holding its annual Adopt-a-Cat day, with hundreds of cats and kittens looking for new homes. Prospective owners can fill out a survey that will color-code their personalities to match with available animals. 
 On average, a cat costs $1,000 a year to maintain, compared with about $1,500 a year for a dog, Ms. Levine said. Having a pet can bring healthy returns, especially during bear markets.
 ''They comfort us; they don't care if your 401(k) lost money today,'' Ms. Saul of Petfinder.com said. ''They're one of the few people in the family who are not going to be stressed out about what you did with your money.''

HEADLINE: Troubles for New York Hotels

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
The city's hotels, whose 77,000 rooms have been packed with record-setting numbers of visitors from Germany, Hong Kong and Peoria, are starting to feel the slowing economy.
 Until recently, tourism had been a bright spot in the city's increasingly gloomy economic picture, fueled largely by foreign tourists taking advantage of a weak dollar. 
 But many hotel operators have begun reporting that bookings for the next few months, traditionally the strongest part of the year, are falling below last year's levels. Cancellations are also on the rise, and corporate travel executives are negotiating for steeper discounts on room contracts for 2009. 
 ''We're already seeing cancellations,'' said Vijay Dandapani, chief operating officer for Apple Core Hotels, which has five budget hotels in Manhattan with a total of almost 800 rooms. ''There's hesitancy in bookings. We hold our breath and fill up rooms at the last minute. Occupancy has been weaker in October, traditionally one of the strongest months.''
 John Fitzpatrick, president of Fitzpatrick Hotels, an Irish chain, said that the three hotels he operates in Manhattan were nearly full Wednesday night, but that he was seeing a ''slowdown in November bookings, with people canceling or holding back.'' He said that he was redrawing his budget for next year in anticipation of a decline, and that he had postponed finishing a $4 million renovation of one hotel, the Fitzpatrick Grand Central. 
 For the first time since 2001, the effective cost of a New York hotel room for a European traveler is going up, because the dollar has gained strength against the euro in recent weeks, according to the Hotel Association of New York City. At the same time, a recessionary wave has started to move across Europe.
 American companies under financial pressure are also placing greater restrictions on corporate travel. 
 The situation is not yet dire. Although Apple Core's occupancy is down 10 percentage points from over 90 percent during the same period last year, it is still better than in most other American cities. 
 But no one knows whether it is a temporary or long-term trend. Mr. Dandapani, Mr. Fitzpatrick and other operators fear that falling bookings and rising cancellations hint at a downturn for one of the city's most robust industries. Hotels have been full more than 200 days a year for four years, and the average room rate has soared 48 percent since 2004 to $302.52 last year, according to PKF Consulting, a national research and hotel advisory firm.
 ''The last two weeks have seen occupancy drop substantially over the same period last year,'' said John A. Fox, senior vice president at PKF. ''We are way down, but down to levels other cities would give their right arm for.''
 The average occupancy rate at New York hotels was 86.5 percent last year, and had been on pace to be higher this year. In August, for instance, it was 92.4 percent, up from 90.1 percent in August 2007, according to PKF Consulting. The average room rate, $304.52 in 2007, was the highest in the nation, but New York also faces higher operating and fuel costs. 
 New York hotels have benefited in recent years from the city's international popularity and a deluge of foreign and domestic visitors, which topped a record 46 million last year, according to NYC & Company, the convention and visitors bureau. From 2003 to 2007, the number of international visitors grew by 83 percent.
 Even when domestic tourism began to fall off this year, foreigners picked up the slack. In August, 5 percent fewer people arrived at New York-area airports from other American cities compared with a year earlier, but the decline was offset somewhat by a modest increase in foreign travelers, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.
 But that now appears to be changing.
 ''Our hotels have experienced few cancellations,'' said Michael J. Stengel, vice president of Marriott Hotels in New York City, which includes 21 hotels and about 7,000 rooms. ''But as you look forward, demand is starting to soften for the fourth quarter. Even some of the international travel is starting to soften.''
 Jonathan Tisch, chairman of Loews Hotels, which operates the 400-room Loews Regency on Park Avenue at 61st Street, is also worried about the future. ''My sense is that we'll be O.K. through the holidays,'' Mr. Tisch said. ''My real concern is what happens after the first of the year.''
 Yet the number of hotels continues to increase. About a dozen hotels were expected to open this year, according to a report by NYC & Company. The report projects that 37 more, with more than 7,000 rooms, will open in 2009.
 ''There are a lot of potential hotels supposedly opening in 2009,'' Mr. Stengel said, ''but we think a lot of those will be delayed.'' 
 The hotel trade association is also worried about talk in the City Council of raising the city's hotel tax, already one of the highest in the country, at a time when New York faces a $2 billion budget gap. With the help of the Bloomberg administration, hotel operators blocked a similar proposal in June.
 Lewis A. Fidler, a city councilman from Brooklyn who supports raising the tax, said a one-point increase would raise $70 million annually. ''The idea of not reaching into the pocket of foreign tourists before reaching into the pocket of New Yorkers is offensive,'' Mr. Fidler said.
 But Joseph Spinnato, president of the hotel association, said, ''We feel very strongly that any tax increase would be detrimental to the industry and the city.''
 A report by Sean Hennessey of Lodging Investment Advisors, commissioned by the hotel association, argues that even a one-point increase in the city's 14.54 percent hotel tax could cause a loss of more than $533 million in sales and 3,716 jobs. 
 In the early 1990s, the hotel industry waged a successful battle to cut the tax to less than 15 percent from 21.25 percent. In the years that followed, occupancy increased and the average room rate rose faster than inflation. But one hotel analyst suggested that it had more to do with a thriving economy and New York's popularity than with a lower tax.

HEADLINE: Federal Leap Into Banking Has Its Perils

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Now that the big five investment banks of America have been shut down, sold off or turned into more staid bank holding companies, there is one big risk-taking banker left: the federal government.
The decision this week to put $250 billion in banks in return for shares will make the government a major investor, and owner, in the banking industry. The bold move is one of many that is redefining and enlarging Washington's role in the country's banking system. Especially if conditions worsen, further government actions may be deemed necessary to shelter banks, businesses and consumers from the financial turmoil.
This fundamental shift at least raises long-term questions about government's appropriate role in financing and the economy. Will the government inevitably be tempted to guide lending decisions, steering loans to some and not to others? History shows that government intervention in banking systems can carry its own dangers, with money funneled to political favorites instead of an economy's innovators. 
The federal government's initiatives are all carefully cast as emergency measures that will be phased out in months or years. ''It's explicitly temporary, but we don't really know where this crisis ends yet,'' said Robert E. Litan, an economist at the Brookings Institution. ''The logic of intervention is that the more ownership the government has, the greater the regulation and management control.''
There is a cautionary example, economists say, in today's troubles. The nation's two largest mortgage finance companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, are quasi-governmental institutions. Fannie was created during the depths of the Great Depression, and Freddie in 1970, to help make mortgages more affordable for homeowners.
But as the housing bubble grew, the companies came under political pressure to buy riskier loans and loosen their standards, according to former executives and analysts. Last month, the federal government was forced to bail out Fannie and Freddie and pledged up to $200 billion for the rescue.
''The Fannie and Freddie experience shows what can go wrong if we have too much government interference,'' said Kenneth S. Rogoff, an economist at Harvard and an adviser to the Republican presidential nominee, John McCain.
The government's frenzy of fire-drill policy making in recent weeks has been called ''creeping socialism,'' but even conservative economists generally applaud the moves as prudent in a time of economic peril. Concerns about government intrusion in the marketplace, they say, can be addressed after the financial storm has passed.
''My major concern has been the government not getting sufficiently involved, because financial collapses have been at the heart of the deepest economic contractions over the years,'' said Robert E. Hall, an economist and senior fellow at the Hoover Institution, a conservative research group at Stanford.
Taking ownership stakes in banks to add needed capital to those depleted institutions, Mr. Hall said, was a crucial step. ''We're on the right track now,'' he said.
In a speech on Friday, President Bush portrayed the government moves as forceful yet calibrated. The initiatives were ''decisive measures aimed at the heart of our financial challenges,'' he said. ''And they're big enough and bold enough to work.''
But Mr. Bush also said the bank investments would be limited in size, scope and duration. ''The government intervention is not a government takeover,'' he said. ''Its purpose is not to weaken the free market. It is to preserve the free market.''
The $250 billion bank investment plan is but one sign of the government's expanding role. The Federal Reserve, for example, has traditionally been the lender of last resort to banks. Yet the Fed announced this month that it would become the buyer of last resort for commercial paper -- short-term financing that many businesses issue to finance their daily operations -- acting as a backstop in that $1.6 trillion market.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, as its name suggests, is charged with insuring the savings of bank depositors. The agency not only sharply increased deposit insurance limits, but also said it would guarantee debt issued by banks. The move is an effort to give banks greater confidence to lend to each other and thus get money flowing again. The F.D.I.C. places a ceiling on that guarantee program of $1.5 trillion.
In theory, the funds committed for everything from the bailouts of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and those of the Wall Street firm Bear Stearns and the insurer American International Group, to the financial rescue package approved by Congress, to providing guarantees to backstop selected financial markets is a very big number indeed: an estimated $5.1 trillion.
Still, that unnerving figure -- equal to more than a third of the yearly output of the United States economy -- is mainly a sign of the urgency that government sees in tackling the financial crisis. It is not a total for what will be spent. The unlimited guarantees to backstop lending markets, for example, are temporary confidence-building steps meant to give financially sound banks the comfort to deal with each other. Other steps, like the bank investments, could well turn a profit if the banking industry's fortunes improve later.
The government moves so far are intended to do two things that are essential to stabilize the banking system and nurture an economic recovery. First, the lending and loan guarantee programs by the Fed, F.D.I.C. and Treasury Department are all meant to get normal lending for businesses and consumers flowing again.
Second, the government investments in the banks are intended to steady the banking system by adding capital. Banks have been forced to take big losses as the value of their holdings -- mainly complex securities tied to home mortgages -- has declined. Bank share prices have fallen precipitously as well.
Banks borrow against their assets -- shareholders' equity and holdings -- and lend to customers. As their assets fall, the banks have less leeway to lend, and with asset values declining sharply in recent months, there is the risk of insolvency. So the government has put capital in the banks to add financial ballast and halt a downward spiral in asset values and lending activity.
Eventually, economists and finance experts say, there will surely be a regulatory overhaul of the banking system to try to prevent this kind of financial crisis from recurring.
The current turmoil has its origins in the housing market. The problem developed over years, and many share responsibility: overextended homeowners, overly aggressive mortgage lenders, financial engineers who built exotic securities and bank executives and government regulators who underestimated the risks to the financial system.
As long as housing prices kept climbing, fueled by ever-higher levels of debt, the problems were hidden. But in 2006, when prices peaked and began falling, things started to come undone, though slowly at first. Bank regulators and executives generally agreed there would be losses, but they would be widely dispersed and the impact would be limited. The financial system, they insisted, had been made more resilient by deregulation, technological innovation and the globalization of capital flows.
That remained the prevailing view even after the government prevented Bear Stearns from going under in March by guaranteeing $29 billion of its bad assets, then brokering a deal to sell Bear off to JPMorgan Chase.
But it was the collapse of the investment bank Lehman Brothers in mid-September and its cascading effects across the worldwide financial system that truly changed the thinking everywhere. The complex debt products held by Lehman and others proved to be risk bombs. There was no central exchange, or open marketplace, where the mortgage-backed securities were listed or traded. More banks in the United States and Europe held more of the toxic securities than had been realized.
''No one appreciated how great the failure of risk management really was,'' said Simon Johnson, a former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund.
Shortly afterward, the policy approach shifted from case-by-case bailouts to a more comprehensive approach. After an initial rejection, Congress approved a $700 billion rescue package Oct. 3, giving the Treasury Department and the Fed broad leeway to tackle the problem. At first, the government said it would focus on auctions to buy soured mortgage-backed securities from the banks. But markets plunged the following week, and the government adopted the more emphatic step of taking ownership stakes in banks.
Under the plan, the government is seen as a ''silent partner'' in the banks, without board seats. But analysts expect the government to be more quiet than silent, operating as an adviser that must be consulted. Should the bank sell these mortgage-backed securities for 10 cents on the dollar today or wait a few months and hope to get 40 cents on the dollar? A discrete call to the Treasury or the Fed, analysts say, would seem in order.
''I think the government will be a risk manager extraordinaire,'' said Mr. Litan of Brookings. ''They're not going to tell banks where to lend. But in high-risk kinds of things, they have the role of saying no, no, not there.''

Jenni Williams has been arrested 33 times for leading street protests for social justice during the last five years of President Robert Mugabe's rule in Zimbabwe. The high school dropout with a gift for grassroots organizing has lived underground in Zimbabwe, moving from safe house to safe house as she and her colleagues have built a formidable protest movement in the country's two largest cities.

The draft of an accord between Iraq and the United States would set the end of 2011 as a concrete date for American withdrawal from Iraq. Though the draft does contain specific dates, the language says that the withdrawal date could be changed by mutual agreement and on ''the conditions'' at the time. PAGE A5 
IRAN LOSES SECURITY COUNCIL BID
In the election for the two-year seat on the United Nations Security Council, Japan handily bested Iran, and Iceland's bid to join the council was hampered by its economic woes. Iran's failed bid was painted by some members of the Security Council as a referendum on the country's confrontational stance over its nuclear program. ''Hopefully they will understand that this means that there is no support from the international community for that type of behavior,'' a United States official said. PAGE A8
MEXICO CLOSES INVESTIGATION
The Mexican government concluded that Bradley Will, a journalist from New York City, was shot and killed at close range by an antigovernment protester during civil unrest in the state of Oaxaca two years ago. But that finding was challenged by Mr. Will's family and human rights groups, who called on the Mexican attorney general's office to broaden its investigation to take into account the possibility that Mr. Will was shot from a distance by right-wing radicals.

ENERGY LAW IN CALIFORNIA

In California, Proposition 7, also known as the Solar and Clean Energy Law of 2008, would set among the toughest standards in the country for increasing wind, solar and geothermal sources of electrical power, and seemed like a surefire winner in summertime polls. But renewable-energy companies, environmental groups and the Democratic Party have joined with the major utilities, the business establishment and the Republican Party to oppose it, saying that it is loaded with loopholes and upends a system that is already working.

SENATOR'S TESTIMONY CONTINUES
In his second day of testimony, Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, who is on trial on charges that he knowingly failed to list on Senate disclosure forms some $250,000 in gifts and services for the renovation of his home, emphasized that he did not keep close tabs on the project and left the details to his wife. He said the testimony of his former friend Bill Allen, who is the prosecution's chief witness, was false. PAGE A11

The federal government placed beluga whales that live in Alaska's Cook Inlet on the endangered species list, rejecting efforts by Gov.

Joe Nocera writes that we are past the point of moral hazard, and it may be time for the government to begin helping out struggling homeowners, many of whom owe more on their homes than those homes are worth.

It was not terribly long ago that trial lawyers, who take on companies on behalf of investors, customers or even other businesses, were unpopular among Wall Street types.

FINE ART AND FINANCIAL UGLINESS
Despite several weeks of financial havoc, art is still selling, yet with an underlying sense that the art world has dodged a bullet, but only momentarily. Galleries, museums and other institutions compete for the attention of the international art world with richly stocked booths, exhibitions and opening parties. This week's Frieze Art Fair in London, with 152 participants, was, as usual, more than a bit out of touch with reality, Roberta Smith writes. PAGE C1

HEADLINE: Still True: Live Within Your Means

BYLINE: By M. P. DUNLEAVEY

 BODY:
AS devastating as it is to hear about the global financial crisis, to watch institutions collapse and investors panic, it's not exactly a picnic out here on the sidelines. 
 Countless ordinary Americans are now dealing with a crisis of a personal nature. They're stunned by how quickly the turmoil on Wall Street is spilling over to their own lives and wallets. And few have the slightest idea how to cope, now that normal remedies don't seem to apply.
 ''It's frightening,'' said Andrew Hamersley, an Episcopal priest based in Westfield, N.J. ''I'm hearing a lot of people say that they can't retire when they want to.'' He worries about congregants who are losing their jobs, and people who have withdrawn tens of thousands of dollars from the bank and stashed it at home. 
 The anxiety is at a peak -- and it seems to be contagious. ''I'm consciously not opening the mail,'' Mr. Hamersley admitted, referring to his own retirement statements. ''I don't want to look.''
 In small doses, anxiety can act as a jolt, a wake-up call that prompts people to overcome inertia and take action. But this crisis is so complex and overwhelming that it seems to have pushed many people over a line, into a state akin to helplessness. ''It's like September 12th,'' said Amanda Clayman, a financial therapist based in New York. ''People know the world has changed, but no one knows exactly how.''
 ''I feel unnerved,'' said Robin Bruck-Tanner, a former assistant principal with the New York City Department of Education. Ms. Bruck-Tanner, who is 55, was planning to draw upon her pension next year, but now she questions whether that is the right move.
 She and her husband took an early retirement to move upstate. They started a pottery business, Loving Earth Studio in Arkville. Their investments were such that the move seemed viable, as long as they lived modestly. 
 ''Now we're wondering, were we stupid to have left our jobs so early?'' Ms. Bruck-Tanner said.
 She said that they were trying to restore their previous financial stability, but she was not sure it was worthwhile to build up a bigger savings cushion -- a personal finance standby. ''I'm stocking up on food and other things,'' she said. ''I feel like cash is losing its value. I'd rather use our money to buy things we need.''
 IT'S strange that during a time of such emotional and fiscal chaos, some of the golden rules of personal finance -- save more, spend less, invest for the long haul -- may seem undervalued.
 John Hoina, a podiatrist in Bethpage, N.Y., said he couldn't see any reason to save. ''You wish you had more in reserves. But I look at my investments and think, my God, all that savings -- lost.'' 
 Although he would like to take his money out of the market, that seems even more pointless. ''If I take it out, I get hit with a loss and I'm penalized on top of it. So you have to sit with it.''
 I sympathize. I feel as frozen (and cynical) as anyone else right now -- and I've battled some unholy impulses to cash out my Roth I.R.A. and open a line of credit on my house while I can still get one. But I'm worried about the apparent decline of those basic guidelines.
 If there is one thing I have learned, it is that when any sort of fiscal-emotional fog descends, you may be your own worst enemy.
 There is far too much evidence, behaviorally and even neurologically, that we humans are the most irrational of economic agents, a fact that is not helping anyone right now.
 So if you're sitting on the sidelines enduring the Big Wait, as a friend calls this market limbo, do yourself and your money a favor. Ignore fear; it doesn't help. Re-examine the financial basics; there's a reason ''Live within your means'' has lasted.
 Become a better steward of your money. It is still yours, isn't it?

HEADLINE: A Plan to Improve Health Care and Limit Costs

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH OLSON

 BODY:
THE issue of health care costs usually comes up for discussion right after the economy as costs for businesses and consumers continue to climb. The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association insures 102 million Americans -- one in three people -- and has networks that include 90 percent of the nation's providers and 80 percent of its hospitals.
 The association's board just adopted a four-point initiative aimed at containing health care costs and improving care. The goals range from eradicating hospital infections to pushing for health care coverage for everyone. From Chicago, Scott Serota, the association's president and chief executive, recently discussed the new goals: 
 Q.What was the impetus for adopting a new plan of action, and why now?
 A. Much of what is discussed in virtually all forums as health care reform is really health care financing reform. We really have not gotten sufficient national attention on the real underlying issue, which is that the entire health care delivery system needs to be modified. We, the Blues, feel we should try to drive toward a vision for the health care delivery system which we can move collectively forward with our partners.
 Q.One of your goals is to cut the prevalence of diabetes in half. Why did you select that?
 A. There are 57 million Americans today who are prediabetic. The cost of treating it is $116 billion annually. We treat it pretty well, but there are tangible things we can do in the areas of obesity, weight management, nutrition, fitness and health risk assessment to reduce the incidence of diabetes. We can cut that 57 million number in half and make a dramatic impact not only in the delivery system costs but in people's lives. 
 Q.Your second point is more affordable health care. How do you translate that sweeping goal into something concrete when costs are steadily mounting for both businesses and individuals?
 A. We're not saying the cost of health care will go down. It won't. Our goal is that health care costs rise no faster than any other goods and services. The essential fundamental to getting there is improving the underlying system because 30 percent of care rendered today, according to some studies, is unnecessary, redundant and, in some cases, even harmful. We need to get waste out of the system. That means $700 billion in a $2.4 trillion system. 
 Q.When you say waste, what do you mean?
 A. I'm talking about a whole battery of things like duplicative testing such as two M.R.I.'s instead of one or hospital-acquired infections. The cornerstone of how we get at this is creating a comparative effectiveness institute to study what treatments really work best for a given condition -- and letting everyone know what works. There is legislation on this pending in Congress.
 Q.Medicare just announced it would stop paying hospitals to treat patients harmed by care, like being given an incompatible blood transfusion. One of your goals addressed that -- to eradicate so-called ''never events'' -- but is that the cart following the horse?
 A. Not paying for them is the end point. If they are no longer getting reimbursed for those costs, institutions will be very aggressive in eliminating those events. There are some Blue plans that are not paying for those events. 
 Q.Why haven't more Blue plans limited reimbursement for hospital-caused problems?
 A. More will. We're trying to figure out mechanisms to help them improve their performance. Then we'll tie reimbursement to performance. These events are a huge problem where we haven't made a lot of progress over the last 10 years. We have to fix it, then adjust the financing.
 Q.An ambitious point you have adopted is to ensure that everyone has health care coverage. What specific steps can Blue Cross Blue Shield take to solve something that has remained so elusive?
 A. We believe that every American should have coverage, but 45 million don't have it. The reasons are not the same, but if coverage is affordable, more people will be able to buy it. We also need to work with people who are eligible for government programs but are not enrolling. And we need to develop new products like high-deductible plans to attract people like the ''young invincibles'' -- who think they will never get sick -- and get them in the habit of buying coverage. 
 Q.Do you support proposals like the one from the Republican presidential candidate John McCain that move away from the employer-based system?
 A. It is essential that we continue to support the employer-based system because 162 million Americans today get their coverage through their employer. We should not disrupt this important piece. Employers provide significant financing and they keep us on our toes.
 Q.How do you plan to get others in the health care industry to sign on and help achieve your newly adopted goals?
 A. Conversations, dialogue and meeting with trade association leaders. These are goals for all of us. We are insuring one-third of all Americans so we need to step out and provide leadership with real actionable steps.
 Q.Do you have any near-term -- like one-year -- benchmarks to measure whether the Blues are making progress in meeting each of the new goals?
 A. We will have annual benchmarks that we will put out. We believe that what gets measured is what gets done.

HEADLINE: Caps on Legal Immigrants

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 ''Legal Immigration? Anybody?'' (editorial, Oct. 3) questioned my opposition to a bill sponsored by Zoe Lofgren, chairwoman of the House Judiciary subcommittee on immigration, to increase legal immigration. 
 Ms. Lofgren should be willing to settle on a limit on the total number of immigrants allowed into the United States each year. Exactly how many immigrants can our country absorb without negatively affecting America's economy, culture and environment? 
 I offered an amendment capping legal immigration at one million. Setting a hard cap would force Congress to choose priorities. 
 Today, only approximately 10 percent of legal immigrants are admitted based on the skills and education they bring. If Ms. Lofgren wants more employer-sponsored immigrants, she should have to persuade Congress to reduce other categories proportionally. 
 Ms. Lofgren is opposed to any hard cap on immigration. And she can't name a single immigration category that she would cut. Anyone unwilling to answer these questions should not be setting national immigration policy.
 (Rep.) Steve King Washington, Oct. 8, 2008
 The writer, a Republican from Iowa, is the ranking member of the House Judiciary subcommittee on immigration.

HEADLINE: Work in Progress

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. 

 BODY:
Ask students like Usha Persaud about the Rutgers football team, and they do not talk about its weak offense or whether the Scarlet Knights have a chance against Connecticut in Saturday's homecoming game. 
 Instead, Persaud brings up the campus buses, on which it is harder than ever to get a seat. Or the microphones in the lecture halls, which malfunction so frequently that Persaud and her friend Sushant Bandarpalle have taken to sitting up front to hear their professors. And did she mention that tuition went up?
 Fair or not, Persaud and several other students said that they could not help but link their own hardships to news that the state university planned to move ahead with $102 million in football stadium renovations or that the athletic department received more than $2 million in state earmarks when overall financing to Rutgers was being cut. 
 ''I think it's ridiculous, because there are so many more things they could be spending their money on, like technology in the classroom,'' said Persaud, a junior majoring in biology and psychology. ''Or more buses.'' 
 The mood is sour here these days, and it is not just because the football team is 1-5 this season. Reports about lax and sometimes secretive spending in the athletic department, published in The Star-Ledger of Newark and other New Jersey newspapers in recent months, have come as students are being asked to accept new sacrifices. 
 Tuition, room and board for undergraduates increased 6.5 percent this year, and the state legislature cut funds to the university by 10.8 percent. On Monday, the president of Rutgers, Richard L. McCormick, delivered a pessimistic assessment of the institution's financial state amid the national economic crisis and asked top administrators to draw up plans in case the state cuts its financing again in the middle of the year.
 Sentiments on campus have changed dramatically since 2006, when the football team was the pride of Rutgers, attracting national attention by going 11-2 and nearly winning the Big East championship. The team's coach, Greg Schiano, was courted by Miami and Michigan, and the waiting list for season tickets grew to 12,000. University officials reported that applications and donations grew with the football team's success. For a time, it seemed, Rutgers football had outgrown its reputation as a national punch line and achieved its longtime goal of becoming a contender in big-time college sports.
 But now, even some football fans are reassessing whether university officials moved too quickly to capitalize on the team's success, including authorizing the stadium renovation plan that is now likely to be scaled back because of the economy and anemic private donations.
 ''They had one good year, and everybody said this is the beginning of a trend,'' said George R. Zoffinger, a member of the university's Board of Governors and the chairman of its audit committee, which completed a report in February criticizing the athletic department for poor financial oversight. ''One year doesn't make a trend. That's the problem.''
 University officials were quick to note that athletic department spending did not come at the expense of student services, like the bus system or classroom equipment. Rutgers's $50 million athletics budget -- a mix of private and public money, and revenue from sporting events -- accounted for less than 3 percent of the university's total budget. Although several students mentioned both the crowded bus system and broken classroom equipment, the university has not made cuts in either area, said Greg Trevor, a university spokesman.
 And even if the football team is not doing well, Rutgers's rise in athletic prominence has had positive effects on the university. 
 ''It's become one of the few rallying points for the people of New Jersey,'' said Robert E. Mulcahy III, the Rutgers athletic director. ''It's something that we're very proud of.'' 
 Students and faculty expressed frustration with university officials, especially given revelations about hidden spending and a lack of financial oversight. Articles in The Star-Ledger, for example, reported that Schiano received an extra $250,000 a year from a sports marketing firm that once employed Mulcahy's son and that the state legislature directed $2.25 million over four years to the athletic department, even as the state cut overall financing to the university by $16.4 million.
 ''Oh whoops, where did that $2.25 million out of the last four years of the state budget go, when at the same time they're having consistent cuts to the educational program?'' said Jenifer Branton-Desris, a graduate student. ''When's the state going to 'oh whoops' $2.25 million into coursework and programs?''
 The athletic department's activities are the subject of an investigation by a university committee, and the state comptroller's office is also said to be looking into the matter. Earlier this month, the university announced it would conduct a legal review of all future sponsorship deals and high-level employment contracts, and it hired a supervisor to oversee finances in the athletic department.
 ''I recognize that as we moved from a smaller program to a larger and more nationally visible one, there are points along the way where we could have done better,'' McCormick said.
 Officials now say the second phase of the planned renovation of Rutgers Stadium, which includes adding 13,000 seats and is scheduled for completion in 2009, will almost certainly be scaled back. Rutgers has permission to issue $72 million in state bonds to pay for the stadium, but the rest must be raised through private donations. 
 Until now, the university has been relying on short-term loans to pay for the $35 million already spent on construction, but costs have skyrocketed because of the national credit crisis. 
 ''It's not going well,'' said Raymond J. Lesniak, a New Jersey state senator who is helping to raise money for the project. So far, the university has collected $1.1 million in donations and pledges, Trevor said. 
 Lesniak said he hoped to raise about $10 million in private donations, not enough to close the $30 million financing gap, making it ''certain'' that the stadium renovation would be delayed. 
 But Mulcahy said he was determined to keep the renovations on time and under the $102 million budget. Precisely what may have to be cut has not been decided, he said, but he said he was committed to keeping all of the planned seating because the bonds would be repaid using revenue from ticket and concession sales. In interviews this week, Mulcahy and Schiano said that in stepping up spending on football and other programs, they were carrying out the wishes of university officials to compete at a national level. 
 ''That decision was made long before I got here,'' said Mulcahy, who was hired in 1998. Rutgers entered the Big East in football in 1991, but changing its schedule was not enough, Mulcahy said. ''The problem was that we didn't follow that commitment with the facilities that were necessary.''
 Several students said they still supported the football team and understood that some level of investment was necessary to be competitive. Few, for example, questioned Schiano's $2 million annual salary.
 ''They're not against the expansion, but at the same time, they're wondering, what have we gotten ourselves into?'' said Ryan E. Cooke, the nonvoting student representative on the Rutgers Board of Governors. When he speaks with students, Cooke said, the biggest complaint is the lack of transparency. 
 ''If we were a private university, business decisions like this would not be the people's concerns,'' he said. ''Let's just be honest about what we're doing, and how we're doing it.''

HEADLINE: Indexes Gain After a Volatile Week

BYLINE: By SHARON OTTERMAN; Reporting was contributed by Alan Cowell, Julia Werdigier, Jack Healy and Bettina Wassener.

 BODY:
In the end, Wall Street could not hang on, and the markets closed down again Friday. Yet, after five days of turbulence, all three major indexes finished higher for the week.
 The volatility was extraordinary. The Dow Jones industrial average ranged over 1,600 points in the course of the week, from a high of 9,794 on Monday to a low of about 8,197. The range of the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was even more significant, as it posted its biggest gain since the 1930s on Monday, before plunging Wednesday when retailers reported their sharpest sales drop in three years. 
 ''The magnitude of the shifts was simply unbelievable,'' said Richard Sparks, an analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research. ''As long as I live, I may not see another week like this again in the markets.'' 
 On Friday, the Dow fell 127.04 points, or 1.41 percent, to 8,852.22 and the broader S.& P. index declined 0.62 percent, to 940.55. Leading the decline were shares in Caterpillar, the construction equipment manufacturer, which lost 7.2 percent. The financial and energy sectors also gave up ground. The Nasdaq composite index lost 0.37 percent, to 1,711.29. Yet, the Dow gained 401 points on the week, and the S.& P. 41 points.
 Friday's housing report was the latest data that pointed to a weak September. 
 Housing starts dropped 6.3 percent in September. Not since January 1991, a month of unusually cold weather, had numbers been so low, the Commerce Department said. It was the second-worst month for housing starts since the department began keeping records in 1947.
 ''You get these big swings when you have big differences in opinion among investors,'' said Brian Gendreau, senior investment strategist at ING Investment Management. ''You have some people who are fearful, and others who are looking for opportunity. In this kind of environment, you get this tug of war between them.'' 
 The credit markets showed signs of easing Friday, signs that global efforts to shore up banks might have begun to work. 
 In Washington, the administration continued its campaign to sell the government's financial bailout package to the public, asking Americans to be patient.
 ''The actions will take more time to have their full impact,'' Mr. Bush told the United States Chamber of Commerce. ''It took a while for the credit system to freeze up; it's going to take a while for the credit system to thaw.'' 
 But over all, markets remained at their lowest level in five years. A barrage of bad news over the week indicated that the real economy, beyond the weakness in the financial sector, was heading into or already embroiled in a deep recession. 
 Production at the nation's factories dropped by 2.8 percent in September, the biggest loss since 1974. In addition, manufacturing in the Philadelphia area had the worst month for business in 18 years, and retail sales slumped 1.2 percent, the steepest drop in years. 
 Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at Standard & Poor's, said, ''We already thought that the economy had slipped into a recession. But with the September decline, it's made our estimate for the duration and the depth of the recession greater.'' S.& P.'s analysis indicates the economy will stay in decline until May 2009, he said.
 Oil prices rallied after falling below $70 a barrel to a 13-month low on Thursday. The November contract for crude oil rose $2, to $71.85 in New York trading. 
 One bright spot was Google, which was up 5.5 percent after reporting a 26 percent profit rise for the third quarter, topping analyst estimates after it cut expenses. Revenue rose 31 percent.
 Credit markets showed signs of easing. Yields on three-month Treasury bills rose as investors turned to stocks. Banks charged each other slightly less for overnight loans. And the rate on one-day overnight commercial paper fell, a sign it will be easier for companies to meet their day-to-day expenses. While it remained expensive for companies to borrow money for longer-term needs, those rates also diminished slightly.
 In Europe, stocks advanced on Friday and Asian markets were mixed after a seesaw week.
 The swings on the markets in recent days seemed to leave investors uncertain, even as governments pledged billions in bank bailouts. 
 The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 7/32, to 100 18/32. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was 3.93 percent, down from 3.96 percent late Thursday. 
 Following are the results of Friday's Treasury auction of 74-day and 94-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: Can a President Tame the Business Cycle?

BYLINE: By KEVIN QUEALY

 BODY:
Today, Americans save less and earn a lower minimum wage -- in real, or inflation-adjusted, terms -- than at nearly any other time since 1950. Can voters reasonably expect these and other indicators to change significantly after a new president takes office in January? 
 As important as the economy may be for voters when they go to the polls, many economists contend that presidents have little power over general economic performance during their terms of office, even though some things, like the minimum wage, are set by the government. 
 David Backus, an economist at New York University, recently wrote on the blog of the economist N. Gregory Mankiw that while presidents might contribute to long-term performance, the normal ups and downs of the business cycle had more of an effect on the economy in the short term. 
 ''There's some debate about where business cycles come from, but the president's actions are rarely on the list,'' he wrote. Changes in incomes, jobs and home prices reflect this cyclical behavior, while other indicators, like personal savings as a percentage of disposable income, have shown a gradual decline over decades. If there is a president to praise -- or blame -- for longer-term trends, he is probably not in office now. 
 Kevin Feltes, associate director of the Jerome Levy Forecasting Center in Mount Kisco, N.Y., said that the next president would most likely be reacting to the economy -- not the other way around.'' 
 Given the current condition of the economy, the next president could very well end up running trillions of dollars in federal deficits over the next several years,'' he said, ''whether he likes it or not.''

HEADLINE: Honeywell Cuts Its 4th-Quarter Profit Forecast

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Honeywell International cut its fourth-quarter profit forecast and said it would brace for ''recessionary conditions'' in the United States and Europe next year. Third-quarter profit increased to $719 million, or 97 cents a share, from $618 million, or 81 cents a share, a year earlier. That topped the average Wall Street estimate by 2 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. Revenue rose 6.2 percent, to $9.28 billion. Honeywell now expects to earn 97 cents to $1.01 a share on revenue of $9.4 billion in the fourth quarter. Analysts, on average, had looked for profit of $1.04 a share on sales of $9.8 billion.

HEADLINE: Republicans Rain Negative Automated Calls on Voters in Swing States

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY and JO BECKER; Michael Cooper and Michael Moss contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Voters in at least 10 swing states are receiving hundreds of thousands of automated telephone calls -- uniformly negative and sometimes misleading -- that the Republican Party and the McCain campaign are financing this week as they struggle to keep more states from drifting into the Democratic column.
 Senator John McCain, the Republican nominee for president, has denounced such phone calls in the past: In the 2000 primaries, Mr. McCain was a target of misleading calls that included innuendo about his family, and he blamed them in part for his loss to George W. Bush. This January, too, in South Carolina, Mr. McCain described the calls against him as ''scurrilous stuff,'' and his campaign set up a ''truth squad'' to debunk them. 
 On Friday, a Democratic official in Minnesota said he had received one of these so-called robocalls and had tracked it to a company owned by a prominent Republican consultant, Jeff Larson. According to published news reports, Mr. Larson and his previous firm helped develop the phone calls in 2000 that took aim at Mr. McCain.
 A spokesman for the McCain campaign could not say Friday night whether it had contracted with Mr. Larson's current company, FLS Connect. Phone messages left for Mr. Larson were not answered Friday, nor were messages left at a subcontractor, King TeleServices, which is making the actual calls to voters in Minnesota.
 The Minnesota Democrat, Christopher Shoff, a commissioner in Freeborn County, said the automated call described Mr. Obama as putting ''Hollywood above America'' because he attended a fund-raiser in Beverly Hills hours after the federal government seized control of the insurance giant American International Group. The call was first reported by The Huffington Post.
 ''It is a disgusting form of negative campaigning,'' Mr. Shoff said in an interview, ''calling people randomly off a computerized list, during dinner time, and reciting a message that is misleading, as I knew it to be. Republicans should be talking about serious issues.''
 Tucker Bounds, a spokesman for the McCain campaign, said the ''Hollywood'' robocall was based in fact. ''I would argue that much of these calls are based on hardened facts that American voters should consider,'' Mr. Bounds said.
 Another McCain spokesman, Brian Rogers, said the automated calls placed this year were different from those used against Mr. McCain in 2000 because they were ''100 percent true.'' Mr. Rogers added that it was ''crazy'' to compare these calls to the calls in 2000, which sought to hurt Mr. McCain by describing his ''interracial child'' -- a reference to the McCains' adopted daughter from Bangladesh.
 On Friday, Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, urged Mr. McCain to stop placing automated calls in her state, The Associated Press reported.
 Ben LaBolt, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, said Mr. McCain's use of automated calls in this campaign showed ''just how much Senator McCain has changed since then -- adopting not only President Bush's policies but his tactics.'' In response to the calls, the Obama campaign on Friday added a link on its Web site to FightTheSmears.com, asking supporters to report robocalls. 
 Mr. LaBolt said the Obama campaign was currently making robocalls, but he added: ''The focus of all of our communications is on the direction Senator Obama will take the country and on policy differences between the candidates on issues like health care.'' Republican National Committee officials said they were not aware of any Obama robocalls.
 Such calls are a relatively cheap way to reach large numbers of voters in a short time. A review shows that the current calls on Mr. McCain's behalf are uniformly negative and at times misleading.
 The phone campaign hammers familiar themes that have been playing out for months in the campaign, focusing on Mr. Obama's past associations and trying to portray him as a friend of radicals and liberal Hollywood celebrities.
 In one widely reported call, Mr. McCain raises Mr. Obama's links to William Ayers, a founder of the 1960s-era radical Weather Underground. ''You need to know that Barack Obama has worked closely with domestic terrorist Bill Ayers,'' a recorded voice says. 
 Mr. Obama, 47, and Mr. Ayers, now a 63-year-old education professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, served together on two of that city's philanthropic boards as well as on the board of an education project, the Chicago Annenberg Challenge. The two men have been described as friendly, but are not known to be close. 
 In an Oct. 10 letter to The New York Times, William C. Ibershof, the lead federal prosecutor of the Weathermen in the 1970s, expressed outrage that Mr. Obama was being tarred with the association, adding that he was pleased to learn that Mr. Ayers had ''become a responsible citizen.''
 The ''Hollywood'' robocall, meanwhile, asserts that ''on the very day our elected leaders gathered in Washington to deal with the financial crisis, Barack Obama spent just 20 minutes with economic advisers, but hours at a celebrity Hollywood fund-raiser.'' 
 The information is based on a newspaper report from Sept. 16, when the government took control of the American International Group in an $85 billion bailout. Mr. Obama attended a cocktail reception that night in Beverly Hills that featured celebrities like Barbra Streisand and Leonardo DiCaprio, after a 20-minute briefing by economic advisers. 
 But Mr. LaBolt said Mr. Obama's schedule that day also showed that he was briefed by staff members twice more and spoke with Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke.
 Mr. McCain was not in Washington, either, on the day Mr. Obama was in Beverly Hills; he was campaigning in Ohio. The Obama campaign noted that Mr. McCain had also raised money from Hollywood.
 Voters in North Carolina have received calls accusing Mr. Obama of opposing legislation aimed at protecting aborted fetuses that show signs of life, a position the call states is ''at odds even with John Kerry and Hillary Clinton.''
 ''Please vote,'' the call continues, ''vote for candidates that share our values.''
 The 2003 measure in Illinois that Mr. Obama opposed was virtually identical to federal legislation that Mr. Bush signed into law in 2002 after it was overwhelmingly passed by Congress. But Mr. Obama and other opponents of the Illinois bill have said that the state already had a law protecting aborted fetuses born alive. The Illinois State Medical Society, which also opposed the legislation, said the bill would increase civil liability for doctors and interfere with their patient relationships.

HEADLINE: Whale Protection Bolstered as Palin Objects

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

 BODY:
The federal government on Friday placed beluga whales that live in Cook Inlet in Alaska on the endangered species list, rejecting efforts by Gov. Sarah Palin and others against increased protection.
 The relatively small, whitish whales, sometimes visible from downtown Anchorage, declined by almost 50 percent in the late 1990s, and federal scientists say they have not rebounded despite a series of protections, including a halt to subsistence hunting by Alaska Natives. About 375 whales have been counted in Cook Inlet each of the last two years, according to scientists with the National Marine Fisheries Service.
 ''In spite of protections already in place, Cook Inlet beluga whales are not recovering,'' James W. Balsiger, the acting assistant administrator for the fisheries agency, said in a written statement. The whales are in danger of extinction, Dr. Balsiger said. 
 The announcement, made on a predetermined schedule under the Endangered Species Act, drew further attention to Ms. Palin's positions on environmental issues. The governor, the Republican nominee for vice president, has come under scrutiny for her ambiguous statements about climate change and her administration's failed effort earlier this year to prevent another species, the polar bear, from being listed as threatened. The state is suing the federal government over the polar bear listing.
 As with the polar bear, Ms. Palin's administration opposed the beluga listing in part because of its potential to restrict coastal and offshore oil and gas development. The beluga listing could also affect other projects, including the expansion of the Port of Anchorage and a proposed bridge over Knik Arm that would connect Anchorage to the Matanuska-Susitna Valley and Ms. Palin's hometown, Wasilla.
 ''I am especially concerned,'' the governor said in a written statement in August 2007, when her administration submitted documents to fight the listing, ''that an unnecessary federal listing and designation of critical habitat would do serious long-term damage to the vibrant economy of the Cook Inlet area.''
 On Friday, Ms. Palin said the state had had ''serious concerns about the low population of belugas in Cook Inlet for many years,'' but she called the listing ''premature.'' Her administration challenged the federal government's data, as it did with the polar bear decision. 
 The commissioner of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game, Denby S. Lloyd, said state data showed ''an increase of more than 30 percent in the population, from 278 to 375,'' since 2004. (The National Marine Fisheries Service said estimates had been as low as 278 in 2005.)
 Mayor Mark Begich of Anchorage, a Democrat seeking to unseat Senator Ted Stevens, a Republican, also criticized the listing, citing its potential to impede the port expansion and result in ''hugely expensive new requirements to Anchorage's wastewater treatment.'' Also opposed were Senator Lisa Murkowski and Representative Don Young, both Republicans. 
 The Cook Inlet belugas are among five beluga populations in United States waters, all in Alaska, according to the fisheries agency. 
 Since 2000, the whales have been listed as depleted under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. The fisheries agency made its decision Friday in response to a 2006 petition from environmental groups. An environmental lawyer in Anchorage, Peter Van Tuyn, said he was pleased and somewhat surprised that the agency had agreed that the whales were endangered. 
 ''I have never seen this agency take any more action than it was forced to,'' Mr. Van Tuyn said, ''so going through to endangered is great. I think the population is so darn small that they had no choice.''
 The fisheries agency said the recovery of the whales was ''potentially hindered'' by several factors, including mass strandings, in which large groups of whales can be trapped on land during rapid tide changes that affect Cook Inlet; general development; oil and gas exploration; and pollution. The agency said it would ''identify habitat essential to the conservation of Cook Inlet belugas in a separate rule-making within a year.''

HEADLINE: Beneath the Issues, Strong Personal Views

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER. 
Jennifer Steinhauer and Monica Almeida of The New York Times have traversed the country from the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco to the George Washington Bridge in New York, chatting with voters about the presidential campaign. This is the final article in the series. Previous articles: nytimes.com/politics

 BODY:
That this is a nation of great political passion -- and polarity -- was laid bare on a street corner in Nebraska last week.
Thousands of voters queued up around a giant city block in Omaha to see Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska, whose very presence in a slam-dunk red state said a lot about the topsy-turvy presidential contest.
Opposite the music hall where Ms. Palin, the Republican vice-presidential nominee, was to give her speech, a group of protesters carried signs that read things like, ''I wear Lipstick but I will never vote for you,'' and ''Shill baby, shill!'' as they chanted in support of Senator Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee for president.
One man on the Palin side, who made his way past the protesters, sneered to a friend, ''They act like the world's going to end if Obama is not the president.'' 
While elections often turn on ideas, this one might also be swayed by a paralyzing fear of the other guy. In interview after interview in a 12-state tour from California to New York that ended this week, many backers of Mr. Obama and Mr. McCain seemed utterly convinced that an America under the tutelage of the other ticket would send the nation unbearably toward a precipice.
Nebraska apportions some of its five Electoral College votes by Congressional district, and in Omaha and the surrounding areas there is a fierce battle being waged by the Obama and McCain campaigns for just one of those votes.
There were, of course, pressing issues many voters wanted to discuss. Over the course of two weeks, a majority of those interviewed cited the economy as the crucial issue that would influence their vote next month. Grace notes were health care, national security and occasionally very place-specific concerns, like urban crime, factory job losses and underperforming schools.
But the backdrop to all of that was something far more personal, as voters reacted openly and viscerally to Mr. McCain, the 72-year-old Republican war hero, yoked to one of the least popular presidents in modern times, and Mr. Obama, the unflappable and somewhat inscrutable Democrat from Chicago who would be the country's first black president.
Among the voters who had made up their minds, most expressed an almost frantic dislike for the other candidate -- a dislike that was sometimes far greater than their zeal for their own man.
''With Barack Obama,'' said Cheryl Oddo, a Republican in Strongsville, Ohio, who intends to vote for Mr. McCain, ''I don't even feel like his policies are even a different way of what's right for America. I think his policies are the way of losing America the way we know it now.''
Ditto from the other side.
''I'm voting for Obama because hopefully he'll make a change in the jobs market and with gas prices,'' said Alicia Egas, one of the thousands of unemployed voters in Elkhart, Ind., a hard-hit industrial town. With Mr. McCain in office, she said, she feared ''everything would go downhill from here.''
With Election Day less than three weeks away, the Americans encountered on this road trip held strong opinions but were far less defined by their region than they might have been the last time they voted in a presidential election. Some previously reliable Republican states like Nevada are in play, and there are generally more states not locked into the red-blue grid of the past.
Superficial semiotics offered by pundits rarely proved true. In short, there was an awful lot of latte and Chablis sipping in the red states, and a whole bunch of strict parenting and duck hunting in the blue states.
''Obviously we are conservative here,'' said Cassi Warren, 36, a Republican in Omaha who stared at the protesters against Ms. Palin with a mix of contempt and amusement. ''Fiscally, socially, in every way.''
But she added, ''I don't think there would have been Kerry supporters here four years ago,'' a reference to Senator John Kerry, the Democratic presidential nominee in 2004.
There was a young McCain supporter at the Palin rally with a bright red punk-rock haircut. The next day in nearby Bellevue, Neb., a conservatively dressed retired Air Force X-ray technician ripped into Mr. McCain over, among other things, her perception of his treatment of veterans.
In Omaha, awash in McCain signs and its local paper celebrating Ms. Palin with bold headlines, it was hard to sense any dissent. But at the airport, a rental car saleswoman, who looked as though she was probably young enough to be voting in her first election, had a tiny Obama pin affixed to her Hertz shirt, and a random cafe dweller wore a blue Obama logo shirt.
Ohio was a study in contrasts. In Toledo, the expansive Obama office was buzzing with volunteers, while the McCain office had a lone worker sitting on the same afternoon, staring into a computer.
A walk around Greeley, Colo., revealed several streets with McCain and Obama signs alternating on every other yard. Empty lots by and large featured giant McCain signs, most likely left over from a recent rally there.
Affixed in front of a sad little house on a tiny barren lot was a sign almost bigger than the porch: ''HOPE.'' In many cases, the candidates were more symbols than politicians to so many voters, and they saw no common ground with their neighbors leaning another way. The economy and race were the two great spoons that stirred that political pot.
''I think everyone knows someone who has been out of a job, and that has to change,'' said Susie Velasquez, a voter in Greeley. ''And I don't think that's going to change unless we get Barack Obama in the White House.''
Vernon Cecil, a Republican voter there, said Mr. Obama's economic plan would do just the opposite.
But the economy also has eroded away partisanship, and disgust among even hard-core Republicans toward their party was evident in unlikely corners.
''The concept of nonregulation means don't mess with business and business will take care of us,'' said Mike Jones 63, a geologist in Elko, Nev., who is considering voting for a Democrat for the first time in his life. ''But I was looking to retire, and now what do I retire on?''
Twenty miles away in Lamoille, Nev., Lisa Lafferty, a bartender, summed up her perception of her hometown's view of Mr. Obama in racial, not partisan, terms. She was among the countless people over the two weeks who spoke easily about their distrust of a black candidate to a reporter with a notebook in her hand.
And it caused this reporter to wonder what it was about me. Was it the white color of my skin? My gender? My slight Midwestern accent, all the more pronounced as I moved east of the Missouri River -- that gave people comfort in sharing their ugliest thoughts?
''A lot of people here don't think he's believable,'' said Ms. Lafferty, 26. ''Race background, that's a huge factor out here. If he were another white guy, people probably wouldn't feel that. Most people are saying he won't say the Pledge of Allegiance.''
In Bellevue, Neb., Jessie Puglisi, 22, said, ''Obama is the anti-Christ,'' adding: ''My husband feels the same way. He won't even buy a magazine if Obama's face is on it.''
No matter the place, whether swathed in red or blue, there were voters marooned on their own little political islands.
Dave and Anne Patton, Democrats, sat in the back of the bar in Lamoille, saying nothing as the bartenders and a few customers derided Mr. Obama.
''We don't discuss it much,'' Mrs. Patton said. ''There's no point.''

HEADLINE: Behind McCain, Washington Outsider Wanting Back In

BYLINE: By JODI KANTOR and DAVID M. HALBFINGER; Kitty Bennett and Mark Leibovich contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Cindy McCain was new to Washington and not yet 30 when she arrived at a luncheon for Congressional spouses to discover a problem with her name tag.
It read ''Carol McCain.'' That was the well-liked wife John McCain had left to marry Cindy, to the disapproval of many in Washington.
Fearing that the slight was intentional, she slinked to a half-empty table that never filled. ''No one wanted to sit at her table,'' said Barbara Ross, a friend who was not surprised when Mrs. McCain announced a few months later that she was moving back to Arizona. ''It was like high school.''
Cindy McCain, the wife of the Republican presidential nominee, has spent the last year pursuing a return to Washington: ''a harsh town'' that does not suit her, she has said. 
Nor does campaigning, friends say. She has done relatively few solo events, grants interviews reluctantly-- she declined to speak for this article -- and in introducing her husband at events, she offers few of the heartwarming anecdotes that are the stock in trade of the political spouse. When she finishes, she stands silently behind him, sometimes with an approving smile, sometimes looking strained.
From the start, Mrs. McCain's marriage has been defined by her husband's ambitions, and despite her sometimes punishing ride in political life, she does whatever she must to help fulfill them. As his poll numbers have slid recently, her devotion has seemed only to grow. When the McCain campaign recently stepped up attacks on Senator Barack Obama, Mrs. McCain joined in with startling intensity. The day after the second presidential debate, which did not turn around Mr. McCain's standing in the polls, she interrupted a Fox News interview he was doing to testify to his virtues. At this late date, Mrs. McCain is starting to headline her own rallies, starting in Pennsylvania on Saturday.
''She would walk on broken glass barefoot if it required her to do so in this campaign,'' said Matt Salmon, a former Arizona congressman who knows the couple.
Mrs. McCain, 54, describes herself as her husband's best friend, though for the last two decades they have mostly lived apart, she in Arizona, he in Washington. She initially seemed like an ideal political partner, giving Mr. McCain a home state, money and contacts that jump-started his career. But as the years passed, she also became a liability at times. She played a role in the Keating Five savings-and-loan scandal, and just as her husband was rehabilitating his reputation, she was caught stealing drugs from her nonprofit organization to feed her addiction to painkillers. She has a fortune that sets the McCains apart from most other Americans, a problem in a presidential race that hinges on economic anxieties. She can be imprecise: she has repeatedly called herself an only child, for instance, even though she has two half-siblings, and has provided varying details about a 1994 mercy mission to Rwanda.
Those close to Mrs. McCain say she aspires to be like another blonde, glamorous figure married to an older man: Diana, the Princess of Wales. Mrs. McCain sought out the same mine-clearing organization that the princess supported, joining its board and traveling to minefields, just as her role model had. Mrs. McCain recently told British reporters that as first lady, she would take her cues from Diana, throwing herself into international philanthropy.
First, though, the McCains must win. Mrs. McCain has traveled by her husband's side on the campaign trail and helped reorganize the campaign after it floundered in 2007. When The New York Times reported last winter that Mr. McCain's staffers had urged him to stay away from a female lobbyist during his first presidential run, Mrs. McCain stood by her husband at a news conference and defended his honor.
Politics have always brought the McCains together: as she remarked during his failed 2000 presidential run, campaigns are when the two spend the most time with each other.
''Just when I think we're complete opposites, it turns out we're not, that we've had a common goal -- first the children and now this,'' she told Harper's Bazaar last year.
Washington Experiences
Some of Mr. McCain's Washington friends say they have barely met Mrs. McCain, while fellow mothers at their children's schools say they have little sense of her husband. The two often relax in separate places: Mr. McCain prefers the family's ranch in the Arizona desert, while Mrs. McCain's refuge is a high-rise condominium on the Pacific. (Her husband is ''not a beach person,'' she recently told Vogue.)
From the beginning, John and Cindy McCain had two entirely different experiences of Washington. He was the most popular member of the freshman Congressional class of 1983, with the most heroic background, the most uproarious jokes and, from his days as the Senate's Navy liaison, the highest-level contacts. ''John was clearly the star from the first day,'' said Steve Bartlett, a former congressman from Texas.
Mrs. McCain was 28, nearly two decades younger than her husband and just five years older than his eldest-son. ''Cindy was a little bit star struck by John's fame and the strength of his personality,'' said Diana Dunn, who socialized with the couple. Ms. Dunn, the former wife of William S. Cohen, the former Maine senator and defense secretary, recalls the new Mrs. McCain as gracious but timid, unschooled in Washington conversation, and worried about fitting in.
Carol McCain was still a presence on the social scene, working in the Reagan White House and as an events planner. Everyone knew her story: she had stood by her husband during his captivity in North Vietnam, never passing word of a debilitating car accident, only to discover, a few years after their reunion, that he was leaving her for a younger, richer woman.
Rejected by the clubby Congressional wives, Cindy McCain tried to befriend her husband's aides.
''She seemed lonely,'' said Lisa Boepple, a former chief of staff. But ''she was John's wife, so we didn't really want to hang around with her.''
Mrs. McCain announced she was returning to Phoenix to start a family, but friends detected other reasons. ''I think Cindy made an intellectual decision: I could stay here and fight this, or I could go and do more productive things,'' said Ms. Ross, the friend from back home.
Ever since, the McCains have led only partly overlapping lives, with Mr. McCain -- who was first elected to the Senate in 1986 -- spending the week in Washington. The separation had a political upside: Mr. McCain, initially considered something of a carpetbagger, boasted that his family lived in Arizona. He flew home on weekends, but spent part of them campaigning.
In his absence, Mrs. McCain organized elaborate fund-raisers, like a ''South Pacific'' affair to complement his naval background, complete with Polynesian dancers. She shopped for thoughtful gifts: engraved silver platters to give to staff members on primary night, gold elephant lapel pins, and gag presents, like a cowboy outfit for Victoria Clarke, then an aide who knew little about the West. For his district offices, she ordered native Arizonan plants -- which all promptly died, according to Peggy Rubach, a former aide.
Mrs. McCain expanded her childhood home, turning it into a 10,000-square-foot mansion that struck more than one visitor as a shrine to her husband. On the walls, she hung photos of the storied McCain military clan and her husband clasping hands with Republican presidents. Elephants adorned the wallpaper in one bathroom and a pot rack in the kitchen. In the master suite, she installed a fireplace carved with ''MC,'' for McCain.
When he was home, the two were ''as affectionate as you can be with John McCain,'' said Wes Gullet, a former aide, explaining that his old boss, with his military training, restless energy and sarcastic humor, is not the cuddly type. ''He's a funny and vivacious guy, but he is not someone who spends his weekend watching 'The Way We Were,' '' Mr. Gullet said.
Recently, Mrs. McCain has called the separations painful, volunteering that she endured several miscarriages alone. She spent subsequent pregnancies mostly confined to home, Ms. Ross said, sitting in a favorite stuffed chair, watching videos. But she rarely complained. ''Her attitude was as a good soldier,'' Mr. Gullet said.
As her family grew, her parents moved across the street to help out, even ordering birthday gifts to be given in her husband's name. ''I'm sure John hasn't been able to get anything done, so send something Cindy would enjoy,'' Marguerite Hensley, Mrs. McCain's mother, would tell G. Darrell Olson, a local jeweler. ''John doesn't have a lot of money, so find something in the $5,000 area,'' she added, according to Mr. Olson. (One year, Mr. McCain chose his own gift for his wife: a ring with her children's birthstones.)
Mr. McCain regretted his absences, but he saw himself as an improvement on his own father and grandfather. ''John's dad had gone to war on Dec. 7'' -- the day Pearl Harbor was attacked -- ''and didn't come home for years at a time,'' Mr. Gullet said.
Scandal and an Addiction
Whatever humiliation Mrs. McCain suffered in her first Washington foray, her trips there in 1989, for weeks of Senate hearings on the savings-and-loan scandal, were worse.
''I can remember once during that time, Cindy saying she didn't know how she was going to get up in the morning,'' Ms. Ross said. For the ever-present news cameras, Mrs. McCain developed what Ms. Ross called ''that stone face'' -- an impassive mask.
Her husband was accused of improperly intervening on behalf of a donor, Charles Keating, whose failed savings and loan had cost taxpayers billions. Four other senators were implicated, and one Senate spouse: Mrs. McCain. She and her father had invested in a shopping center with Mr. Keating, and while Mr. McCain insisted that he had reimbursed Mr. Keating for vacations their families had taken together in the Bahamas, he said his wife, the family bookkeeper, could not find the receipts.
Mrs. McCain busied herself with the American Voluntary Medical Team, a charity she founded to supply medical equipment and expertise to some of the neediest places on earth, like Micronesia, Vietnam and Kuwait in the weeks after the Persian Gulf war.
When Mrs. McCain visited Bangladesh after a cyclone, she stopped at an orphanage founded by Mother Teresa, who was not, as the campaign has said, present for the visit. Mrs. McCain returned with two baby girls; Mr. Gullet later adopted one, and Mrs. McCain informed her husband on landing that they would adopt the other.
In 1994, Mrs. McCain dissolved the charity after admitting that she had been addicted to painkillers for years and had stolen prescription drugs from it. She had used the drugs, first given for back pain, to numb herself during the Keating Five investigation, she confessed to Newsweek magazine. ''The newspaper articles didn't hurt as much, and I didn't hurt as much,'' she wrote in an essay. ''The pills made me feel euphoric and free.''
The scandal broke just as her husband had been trying to rehabilitate his reputation. He had no idea his wife had been an addict, he told the press.
On the Trail
Mrs. McCain has said that the smears during her husband's 2000 presidential bid -- he was accused of fathering a black child, a twisted reference to their daughter from Bangladesh -- left her skittish about presidential politics.
Observers of that campaign and the current one say she seems different this time -- more guarded, more tense, superthin. She rarely campaigns away from her husband's side, and yet their interactions on the trail often appear brief and formal. During the rolling primary-season seminars that Mr. McCain held in the back of his bus, Mrs. McCain sat up front. Once in a while, she joined him, sitting very straight, smiling and saying little. Physically, she seems fragile: she suffers from migraines, hobbled around on crutches last year after a knee injury and recently wore a wrist brace because of a handshaking injury.
In speaking about each other, the McCains use standard lines: she praises his experience, he tells the crowd that she should really be the candidate. Meghan McCain, their daughter, performs the image-softening role spouses usually perform for each other: on her blog, she depicts her father joking around on campaign planes and her mother in polka-dot pajamas. On Friday, Mrs. McCain made rare contact with the reporters covering her husband, distributing Halloween candy and gaily advising, ''Make your dentist happy!''
In interviews, some of Mrs. McCain's statements seem questionable. She often tells of how she moved to California, leaving her children behind, for four months in 2004 to recover from a stroke that left her unable to walk or speak. But news reports from the time indicate she had few discernible impediments. She gave interviews four days afterward, attended a baseball game with her husband and a reporter several weeks later, and spoke at a Tempe, Ariz., Chamber of Commerce event. ''One month out, I feel wonderful,'' she told the audience. The McCain campaign declined to resolve the discrepancy.
Similarly, Mrs. McCain often mentions her travels to Rwanda at the height of the 1994 genocide -- she wrote about it in a recent Wall Street Journal opinion piece and has been praised by politicians and newspaper columnists for jetting into the heart of a massacre. As with her other charity trips, participants praised her eagerness to help victims of tragedy. But news accounts and interviews indicate, and a campaign spokesman confirmed, that Mrs. McCain traveled after the genocide had ended, spending time with refugees in neighboring Zaire, now Congo. Asked if she was ever in Rwanda, as Mrs. McCain has stated many times, a campaign spokesman, Jill Hazelbaker, said ''she was driven to the Zaire/Rwanda border in order to assess the conditions of the refugees entering the country.''
Whatever stumbles she may have made in telling her story, Mrs. McCain has exhibited the signal trait of the political spouse: a burning desire to win. In summer 2007, she helped reorganize her husband's campaign after it almost fell apart, sitting down with the books to review the cash-flow. Rick Davis, a contentious figure in the McCain camp because of his lobbying ties, emerged as campaign manager, in part because Mrs. McCain, with whom he spent months traveling and fund-raising, backed him.
''It was at a time when most people had given up on John,'' said Mr. Salmon, the former Arizona congressman. ''When he was down, Cindy was extremely positive.''
Asked to explain how Mrs. McCain can seem so uncomfortable on the trail and yet so intent on victory, friends say she truly believes that her husband is the best man for the job. Some note she has invested for decades in his career and now sees the ultimate prize in reach; others say she wants approval, from either her husband or the public. At a Florida rally on Thursday, the crowd greeted her with chants of ''Cin-dy! Cin-dy!''
If Mr. McCain wins, she would have to return to the town she says she dislikes, attending the same sorts of luncheons she once fled from. But this time -- maybe at the annual event that Congressional wives have for the first lady -- the women of Washington, including a few who shunned her the first time around, would have to applaud in Mrs. McCain's honor.
THE LONG RUN: This is part of a series of articles about the lives and careers of the Republican and Democratic candidates for president in 2008.
Correction: October 22, 2008, Wednesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Saturday about Cindy McCain, the wife of the Republican presidential nominee, Senator John McCain, misspelled the surname of one of his former aides. She is Victoria Clarke, not Clark.

 BODY:
It's over.
I've studied the polls and the electoral map for months, and I no longer believe that John McCain can win. Unless Barack Obama slips up, Jeremiah Wright shows up or a serious national security emergency flares up, Obama will become the 44th president of the United States.* 
The wayward wizards of Wall Street delivered the election to Obama by pushing the economy to the verge of collapse, forcing leery voters to choose between their pocketbooks and their prejudices. McCain delivered it to Obama with his reckless pick of Sarah Palin. That stunt made everything that followed feel like a stunt, tarnishing McCain's reputation and damaging his credibility so that when he went negative it backfired. And, some radical rabble among McCain's supporters delivered it to Obama by mistaking his political rallies for lynch mobs.
This perfect storm of poor judgments has set the stage for an Obama victory. It's over. Fast forward to Nov. 5.
President-elect Obama (yes, get used to it) could wake up that morning as one of the most powerful presidents in recent American history. Not only is his party likely to maintain control of both houses of the Congress, it could dramatically strengthen its hand.
According to a New York Times/CBS News poll released this week, the percentage of people who say that they approve of the way their own member of Congress is handling his or her job has never been lower and the percentage who say they disapprove has only been higher once before: on the verge of the Republican Revolution in 1994 when the Republicans picked up 54 seats in the House and 8 in the Senate. But this time voters seem to be more disenchanted with Republicans than with Democrats. In November 1994, the Republican Party's favorable rating was 54 percent and the Democrats' was 44 percent. In the most recent poll, the Democrats' favorable rating was 52 percent and the Republicans' was 37 percent.
Some think that the Democrats could even pass the magic 60 mark in the Senate, providing them with a filibuster-proof majority. The last president to enjoy that advantage was Jimmy Carter.
Add to that the possibility of Obama appointing several justices to the Supreme Court (Carter didn't appoint any), and the probability of his receiving an enthusiastic embrace from the international community, and we could see an administration unlike any we've seen for more than a generation.
Obama would make history by simply assuming office. But then, the question of governance: could this gifted, 47-year-old, first-term senator with a razor-thin political resume harness his enormous power to push through an agenda that would meet our daunting challenges and secure our future?
History will be the judge, but on Nov. 5, it's on.
*If I'm wrong, I'll take my crow with a six pack of Liquid-Plumr.

HEADLINE: Empires Built on Debt Start to Crumble

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Are the Russian oligarchs going bust?
In the current global financial crisis, perhaps no community of the superaffluent has fallen as hard, or as fast, as the brash Kremlin-connected insiders whose wealth was tied up in the overlapping bubbles of the Russian stock market, commodity prices and easy credit.
Already, Russia's richest man, Oleg V. Deripaska, the nuclear physicist turned post-Soviet corporate raider, has ceded more than a billion dollars in assets to jittery creditors as his aluminum-to-automobile empire reels.
''Half the Russians could fall off the Forbes list'' by next year, Maxim V. Kashulinsky, the editor of the Russian edition of the magazine, said in an interview. 
Those most in favor with the Kremlin -- who expanded fastest and ran up the largest debts -- are most at risk now as borrowing costs soar.
Most of the ultrawealthy have large stakes in the mining and petroleum behemoths of the Russian economy, stakes gained through the legally questionable privatizations of the 1990s. A decade later, company ownership has still not spread to a broad shareholder base as in the West. Without a broad base of potential customers, the stock market here has tanked even faster than exchanges in the United States.
In America, toxic mortgage-backed securities sank mighty investment banks. In Russia, it is the empires of the oligarchs and the loans they took out from Western banks, using shares in their companies as collateral, that are at risk.
In a number of cases the value of shares pledged by Russia's rich has fallen below the value of the loans, an ominous sign for the market here, where the benchmark RTS index is already down 71 percent from its peak in May.
Western banks are not immune. Their exposure to oligarch debt came into focus last week when the Russian central bank reported that, all told, Russian companies have to repay $47.5 billion to foreign creditors by the end of this year, and $160 billion by the end of 2009.
If banks require businesses to sell shares to repay these loans, ''the Russian stock market could come down like a house of cards,'' Michael Kavanagh, a mining sector analyst at Uralsib bank, said.
''This could be a game changer for a lot of very, very large players,'' Rory MacFarquhar, an economist at Goldman Sachs in Moscow, added. ''The ground is shifting under them.''
Not all of Russia's rich are hurting. Their yachts, jets and London mansions are not yet up for sale. For instance, Roman A. Abramovich, the owner of the Chelsea Football Club in London, has not sold his 377-foot yacht, Pelorus. Or the 282-foot Ecstasea, his other yacht.
In the 1998 financial crisis, ordinary Russians lost savings in a devaluation of the ruble. This time is different. The wide middle class that emerged under the former president and now prime minister, Vladimir V. Putin, and the oil boom has yet to feel the financial turmoil, because few own stocks. That could change depending on how badly the economy is hurt by falling commodity prices and the flight of an estimated $74 billion in foreign investment since Aug. 1.
Estimates of the oligarch's losses are necessarily rough. Bloomberg News calculated the richest 25 Russians on the Forbes list lost a collective $230 billion since the market peak, based on declines in value of publicly traded companies and analysts' estimates of private company losses. That would make their collective loss over five months four times greater than the total wealth of Warren E. Buffett.
The oligarchs' remaining assets, based on this estimate, would be worth about $140 billion.
In a more narrow sampling, Forbes magazine on Sept. 22 estimated that the loss for 10 oligarchs whose wealth was primarily in public companies totaled $42.75 billion, or 34.1 percent of their estimated worth on Jan. 1.
Vladimir S. Lisin, the steel magnate, led the list with a loss of $11.21 billion on declining share value at his company, Novolipetsk Steel.
Spokesmen for Mr. Deripaska and Mr. Abramovich brushed off estimates based on gyrating stock prices as misleading, noting that the paper gains at the market peak were just as provisional as the losses today.
But the Moscow office of UniCredit, the Italian bank, said Mr. Deripaska; Mikhail M. Fridman, a partner in a conglomerate with telecoms, oil assets and grocery stores; and Vladimir P. Yevtushenkov, who owns a cellphone company, real estate and retail businesses, are at risk from overstretched credit backed by tumbling shares.
UniCredit, with liquidity problems of its own, has turned to Libyan government investors for a cash infusion.
Mr. Deripaska, who, like Mr. Abramovich, was an orphan and a driven young man, achieved unimaginable wealth in the chaos of the immediate post-Soviet period, seizing on the windfall profits of the commodity boom to begin a global expansion. He built his empire on debt.
Mr. Deripaska and Mr. Lisin, the steel tycoon, are seeking bailout loans from the state for an undetermined amount. The government has set aside $50 billion from its rainy day fund, made up of oil revenue, to aid struggling businesses.
The rules under Mr. Putin as understood by all players after the incarceration of Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky in 2003, suggest a strict quid pro quo of government largess in exchange for fealty and payments to Kremlin pet projects.
Mr. Deripaska has been on both ends.
In 2007, the owner of Russneft, one of the country's largest private oil companies, said he would sell his business to Mr. Deripaska, seen as closer to authorities, but added in an open letter that the sale was not voluntary. ''They made an offer to leave the oil business,'' the owner, Mikhail S. Gutseriev, said. ''To make me more amenable, they tightened the screws.'' Mr. Gutseriev fled into exile and is believed to be living in London.
Expansion of his empire, however, put Mr. Deripaska at risk now that markets are falling.
Last month, Mr. Deripaska shed his investment in Magna International, the Canadian auto parts maker, to a bank that financed the $1.54 billion purchase. Mr. Deripaska's conglomerate, Basic Element, said it did not have a liquidity crisis but sold the stake to finance other projects.
Last week, Mr. Deripaska divested himself of his 9.9 percent stake in the German construction company Hochtief. He refinanced his holding in Strabag, an Austrian construction company, through a 500-billion-euro loan from Raiffeisen Bank, staving off a possible seizure by Deutsche Bank.
''This is global,'' said one Moscow banker of the crisis, who did not want his name used in remarks critical of the business practices of his Russian clients. ''Home rules don't apply.''
In April, Mr. Deripaska bought a 25 percent stake in Norilsk Nickel, a once-coveted company whose stock has turned poisonous for the Russian oligarchy. Norilsk stock tumbled on falling nickel prices and rumors that the owners were dumping shares to repay loans.
In the latest sign unlikely to help build investor trust in Russian corporations, some rich Russians have apparently taken to using their board control of publicly traded companies to siphon off money to bail out unrelated personal projects.
For instance, Sibir Energy, a Siberian oil company, spent $274 million on a Moscow hotel this week. The seller? The oligarch Shalva Chigirinsky, who is also the principal Russian shareholder in Sibir. Similarly, Norilsk has bought 25 percent of a natural gas field owned by a Norilsk shareholder, Vladimir O. Potanin, the metals and mining oligarch.
In a deal typical of the high-wire finance of the oligarchy in the boom, for his stake in Norilsk, Mr. Deripaska paid $8.5 billion in shares in his aluminum company and $4.5 billion in cash, drawn on credit from Western banks, including Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. The stake in Norilsk is worth about $2.34 billion today, less than the loan amount.
Konstantin A. Panin, a spokesman for Basic Element, said the company's diversity would help it pull through the financial crisis and swooning commodity prices. ''There are, however, no companies that have not been affected by the global crisis,'' he said. ''We believe that this crisis will only make us stronger, because we know how to stay competitive and will be there for our partners and customers when everything settles down.''
Until that happens, the Moscow business elite are on edge.
Just last week, they gathered for an anticrisis pep talk from a man who knows: Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor. As waiters drifted silently about, balancing trays of caviar canapes, a string quartet played Tchaikovsky and bankers traded market collapse rumors.
The evening was sponsored by Mr. Fridman's Alfa-Bank to honor Intel with a foreign investors award. Mr. Giuliani suggested that Russia and the United States cooperate on financial stabilization, despite their differences. ''We don't want it to affect the bottom line,'' he said. Meanwhile, a banker eyed the passing caviar trays and with a sigh lamented he had not brought a carry-out bag. (The Alfa Group partners have lost at least $12.1 billion, Bloomberg News estimates.)
Not all of the Moscow business world is worrying about tomorrow's meal, however.
Mikhail D. Prokhorov, the youthful mining tycoon, seemed washed up earlier this year after selling his shares in Norilsk to Mr. Deripaska. Now, he is sitting on $4.5 billion from a syndicated loan from Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and other Western banks.
Speculation has swirled about how Mr. Prokhorov might occupy his early retirement after the Norilsk sale. One pet project is a lifestyle magazine for the Russian rich, titled Snob.
On the cover of the October issue is a man crumbled on the floor, covering his face with his hands, as if in sorrow.

HEADLINE: How and Why of the Financial Mess

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re ''Why How Matters'' (column, Oct. 14):
 Thomas L. Friedman should not blame the Americans who opposed laissez-faire capitalism, starting with the ''Reagan Revolution,'' for the current financial mess, nor its innocent victims for accepting houses they could not afford, given to them by unregulated Ponzi scheme capitalists.
 The blame lies with those still in the White House and those trying to get there who foster the belief that government regulation is not necessary because ''the market will take care of itself.'' Well, the market has indeed ''taken care of itself'' -- and look at the destruction it has wrought. 
 Tom Miller Oakland, Calif., Oct. 15, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman sets aside political correctness and boldly states that many subprime borrowers are, to an extent, responsible for the current financial crisis. Most talking heads and people in Washington continue to lay most of the blame on Wall Street, which intelligent observers know is inaccurate.
 So, who are the responsible parties? The aforementioned borrowers. The solicitors who did not care whether borrowers could repay so long as they received a fee. Banks that did not apply longstanding credit standards to determine if borrowers could repay. Packagers -- investment banks -- that did not concern themselves with credit as the paper was rapidly sold to others.
 And finally, let's not forget Congress and the last three presidents, who promised the ''American dream'' to millions who could not afford it.
 Salvatore J. Bommarito New York, Oct. 15, 2008
 To the Editor: 
 In reading Thomas L. Friedman's column describing the moral hazard of easy credit, I saw a parallel in the federal government's fiscal policy.
 In reducing taxes while increasing spending and driving up the deficit and national debt to record levels, the administration believed that the increased availability of capital from low taxes and high spending levels would generate G.D.P. growth to more than offset any shortfall. Is this really any different from a homeowner's overleveraging on cheap debt in the belief that increases in home values would cover the risk?
 With this kind of fiscal leadership providing the example, is it any wonder the country followed suit in piling on debt and counting on growth to pull it through?
 William Bintzer Mamaroneck, N.Y., Oct. 15, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman writes, ''The Puritan ethic of hard work and saving ... is more alive today in China than in America.'' He warns that we have to return to the basics in mortgage lending to where the person receiving the loan can actually pay it back.
 There are a few sub-subprime lenders in some of the poorest places in the world who are actually getting mortgage lending right. Jamii Bora, a microfinance group started in the slums of Nairobi, Kenya, is building a new town of 2,000 houses and 3,000 business spaces. The houses each have two bedrooms, a kitchen, living room and bathroom and cost the same as a one-room shack in the slums. What is required to qualify for a home loan is having successfully repaid three self-employment loans.
 Grameen Bank's home loans to more than 600,000 Bangladeshis also require successfully repaying three self-employment loans.
 Yes, ''how'' really does matter.
 Sam Daley-Harris Director Microcredit Summit Campaign Washington, Oct. 15, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Thomas L. Friedman wrote: ''You cannot tell tens of thousands of people that they can have the American dream -- a home, for no money down and nothing to pay for two years -- without that eventually catching up to you.''
 We Americans inbreed this mentality, this delaying of payment due, across the marketplace, not only with reckless home-buying commitments. Need I remind everyone about the enticements of zero down, a year before your first payment (in some cases, two years or three) of our leading home appliance giants? Rich or poor, we have all had those pitches drilled into our consumer-driven heads.
 A $600 deferred payment on a stove and a $250,000 deferred payment on a home produce a related, pervasive mentality -- and it is poisonous.
 Cliff Davis Newburgh, N.Y., Oct. 15, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Why is the American dream defined solely in terms of owning one's own home? Why is this particularly American?
 Why isn't the American dream ever spoken of in terms of justice, equality, freedom and responsibility? Does the very definition of who we are as a people and nation have to boil down to things and owning them -- however necessary and desirable?

HEADLINE: Mayor Enlists His Charities In Bid to Stay

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and DAVID W. CHEN; Sewell Chan and Jonathan P. Hicks contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Michael R. Bloomberg, who says he strictly separates his philanthropy from his job as mayor of New York, is pressing many of the community, arts and neighborhood groups that rely on his private donations to make the case for his third term, according to interviews with those involved in the effort.
 As opposition mounts to his plan to ease term limits, those people said, the mayor and his top aides have asked leaders of organizations that receive his largess to express their support for his third-term bid by testifying during public hearings and by personally appealing to undecided members of the City Council. Legislation that would allow him to run for another term is expected to come up for a Council vote as early as next week. 
 The requests have put the groups in an unusual and uncomfortable position, several employees of the groups said. City Hall has not made any explicit threats, they said, but city officials have extraordinary leverage over the groups' finances. Many have received hundreds of thousands of dollars from Mr. Bloomberg's philanthropic giving and millions of dollars from city contracts overseen by his staff. 
 An official at a social service group that receives tens of thousands of dollars from Mr. Bloomberg and has a contract with the city was startled to receive a call in the past few days from Linda I. Gibbs, the deputy mayor for health and human services. Ms. Gibbs asked whether the organization's leaders would be willing to call wavering council members to argue for Mr. Bloomberg's term limits legislation.
 ''It's pretty hard to say no,'' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of upsetting the mayor. ''They can take away a lot of resources.''
 A spokesman for the mayor, Stu Loeser, said that many of the organizations that have publicly supported the extension ''are groups that we have been working with over the last seven years to move New York forward, and the reason we are asking for the opportunity for another four years is to keep New York moving forward.''
 Mr. Loeser said Mr. Bloomberg took pains to separate his charitable giving from his day-to-day management of the city. 
 Nevertheless, public hearings on Thursday and Friday and interviews with council members revealed the extent to which the mayor is relying on those who have received donations from him as he pushes for the legislation, which would permit officials elected citywide and council members to serve 12 years rather than 8. Several administration officials confirmed that top mayoral aides, including Deputy Mayors Edward Skyler and Kevin Sheekey, have encouraged groups to join the effort.
 Officials from five groups that have received significant charitable contributions from the mayor testified on behalf of his bill -- the Doe Fund, the Harlem Children's Zone, the Public Art Fund, the Alliance of Resident Theaters and the St. Nicholas Neighborhood Preservation Corporation. In addition, other recipients of his philanthropic funds, including Safe Space, a charity that works to keep children out of foster care, and Jazz at Lincoln Center, have been lobbying council members behind the scenes.
 None of the officials disclosed their financial ties to the mayor's charity when they testified.
 Mr. Bloomberg routes the money to the groups through large and technically anonymous donations to the Carnegie Corporation, but it is an open secret that he is a source of the gifts, which generally range from $10,000 to $150,000.
 Since he was elected, for example, Mr. Bloomberg has given the Harlem Children's Zone more than $500,000, according to records and interviews with those familiar with the process. The group's president, Geoffrey Canada, vigorously endorsed Mr. Bloomberg's legislation in testimony on Thursday. 
 Mr. Canada said that ''if I thought it mattered to the Council, I would have disclosed'' the contributions from Mr. Bloomberg. He said he supported the mayor's campaign to remain in office because of his record as a manager and his courage to raise property taxes to strengthen the city's finances. 
 Officials from other groups also said they would have backed Mr. Bloomberg's plan whether or not he had given them money or solicited their support. 
 Susan K. Freedman, who heads the Public Art Fund, which has received more than $500,000 from Mr. Bloomberg, testified for his bill and praised his record of promoting projects like Olafur Eliasson's ''Waterfalls,'' the East River cascades that were dismantled this week. ''The mayor believes in what I believe in,'' she said.
 The Doe Fund, a homeless-services organization, has received about $150,000 from Mr. Bloomberg since he took office. At the request of the mayor, the group's founder and president, George McDonald, testified for the mayor's proposal.
 Ken Frydman, a spokesman for the Doe Fund, said that Mr. McDonald ''would have shown up to testify in any case, as a longtime politically active resident of the city, who cares deeply about extending term limits.''
 At least 11 Doe Fund employees, including several senior officials, testified in favor of the mayor's plan, but most of them did not identify their employer, describing themselves only as residents of their neighborhoods. 
 Mr. Frydman said there was no coordination by the Doe Fund.
 Kenneth Sherrill, a political science professor at Hunter College, said it was inappropriate for the mayor to be asking the groups that are so dependent on his good graces to take a position on his legislation.
 ''It's distasteful. And what's distasteful about it is leaning on weak people -- people who are vulnerable,'' Mr. Sherrill said. ''The problem is in the implicit threat that if you don't help, we're going to remember.''
 The mayor remains broadly popular, and many of those who testified before the Council over the past two days, including a former Time Warner chief executive, Richard D. Parsons, argued that Mr. Bloomberg's experience was needed to help the city deal with an economic crisis that could be ''frightening, perilous or even dangerous.'' 
 Still, the opposition Mr. Bloomberg has encountered over the bill has been more intense than anticipated. Despite the intense efforts of his staff to turn out a favorable crowd, a solid majority of the nearly 250 who testified during the two days said they opposed it, according to a tally by The New York Times.
 Fred Siegel, a professor of history at Cooper Union who has studied New York City politics for decades, said Mr. Bloomberg had cynically ''reversed the flow of money'' in politics to build the illusion, if not the reality, of widespread support. 
 ''The traditional politicians are bought by special interest groups, but Bloomberg buys special interest groups,'' he said.
 Mr. Bloomberg, in his radio program on Friday, said he remained ''cautiously optimistic'' that the Council would pass his bill, and he was pleased to see ''democracy at work'' during the two days of hearings.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 22, 2008

 CORRECTION:
An article in some editions on Saturday about Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's enlistment of nonprofit groups that rely on his private donations to support his efforts to ease term limits overstated the action taken by Safe Space, a charity that works to keep children out of foster care. Safe Space collected signatures for a letter to send to New York City Council members supporting Mr. Bloomberg's plan, but never lobbied the council members ''behind the scenes.'' (It ultimately decided not to send the letter.)

HEADLINE: How Voters See the Bailout

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and economics in his blog at norris.blogs.nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THE most important legislation passed by the current Congress almost certainly was the bank bailout bill. Whether it will do much good is still unclear, but there is little doubt that most Americans were not impressed, even though the bill was backed by Congressional leaders, the president and both major presidential candidates.
Passage of the bill appears to have pushed the approval rating for Congress to a record low, leaving Congress far less popular than President Bush, whose standing with voters is close to historic lows. It may affect several legislative races next month, in which senators and members of Congress who backed the legislation have slipped in polls. 
But the bailout seems to be having no impact at all on the presidential race. Both Senator John McCain and Senator Barack Obama voted for it, and neither man chose to mention it in this week's final presidential debate.
There is virtually no difference between Obama backers and McCain supporters in terms of supporting the bailout, as is shown in the accompanying chart based on the New York Times/CBS poll taken from Oct. 10 to 13.
Among those who thought the bailout was a good idea, the split in favor of Senator Obama was 55 percent to 37 percent. Among those who opposed the bailout, the split was 53 percent to 37 percent.
That raises the question of what might have happened if one major candidate had risked going against the unified political establishment in Washington and had voted against the bill. Would that move have appealed to the majority of Americans who say they dislike the bailout, or would it have backfired by making that candidate seem irresponsible?
The debate on Wednesday might have been more entertaining -- and perhaps more illuminating -- if the two most prominent third-party candidates, the independent, Ralph Nader, and Bob Barr, a Libertarian, had been included. They represent the two major strains of opposition: Mr. Nader thinks it is homeowners, not banks, who deserve help, while Mr. Barr sees the bailout as a violation of free enterprise principles.
If the split between the Republicans and Democrats cannot be seen in the overall support for the bailout, it can be seen in expectations of what will happen now.
One question in the poll asked if the beneficiaries would be ''mostly just a few big investors and people who work on Wall Street'' or whether it would help ''homeowners and people throughout the country as well.''
A large majority of those polled -- 63 percent -- thought the bailout would benefit only Wall Street, and those voters were overwhelmingly for Senator Obama, by a 59 percent to 31 percent margin.
If there were more people who thought the bailout would help everyone, perhaps Mr. McCain would be doing better in the polls. Among the 28 percent of Americans who thought everyone would benefit, the Obama lead is a statistically insignificant one point, 44 to 43.
Among the Senate races that could be affected are two seats held by Republicans, in Minnesota and Georgia. The incumbents, Norm Coleman and Saxby Chambliss, were ahead in the polls before their vote for the bailout, but the latest polls give Mr. Coleman's opponent, the former comedian Al Franken, a narrow lead. In Georgia, Mr. Chambliss has seen his substantial lead narrow, although he is still ahead of Jim Martin, a former state legislator. Both Democrats have made the votes a central issue in their campaigns.
In the House, Jim Marshall, Democrat of Georgia, and Paul Kanjorski, Democrat of Pennsylvania, are fighting tough races in which their Republican opponents are criticizing them for backing the bailout.

HEADLINE: NEARING RECORD, OBAMA AD EFFORT SWAMPS McCAIN

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA 

 BODY:
Senator Barack Obama is days away from breaking the advertising spending record set by President Bush in the general election four years ago, having unleashed an advertising campaign of a scale and complexity unrivaled in the television era.
 With advertisements running repeatedly day and night, on local stations and on the major broadcast networks, on niche cable networks and even on video games and his own dedicated satellite channels, Mr. Obama is now outadvertising Senator John McCain nationwide by a ratio of at least four to one, according to CMAG, a service that monitors political advertising. That difference is even larger in several closely contested states.
 The huge gap has been made possible by Mr. Obama's decision to opt out of the federal campaign finance system, which gives presidential nominees $84 million in public money and prohibits them from spending any amount above that from their party convention to Election Day. Mr. McCain is participating in the system. Mr. Obama, who at one point promised to participate in it as well, is expected to announce in the next few days that he raised more than $100 million in September, a figure that would shatter fund-raising records. 
 ''This is uncharted territory,'' said Kenneth M. Goldstein, the director of the Advertising Project at the University of Wisconsin. ''We've certainly seen heavy advertising battles before. But we've never seen in a presidential race one side having such a lopsided advantage.'' 
 While Mr. Obama has held a spending advantage throughout the general election campaign, his television dominance has become most apparent in the last few weeks. He has gone on a buying binge of television time that has allowed him to swamp Mr. McCain's campaign with concurrent lines of positive and negative messages. Mr. Obama's advertisements come as Republicans have begun a blitz of automated telephone calls attacking him. 
 The Obama campaign's advertising approach -- which has included advertisements up to two minutes long in which Mr. Obama lays out his agenda and even advertisements in video games like ''Guitar Hero'' -- has helped mask some of Mr. Obama's rougher attacks on his rival.
 ''What Obama is doing is being his own good cop and bad cop,'' said Evan Tracey, the chief operating officer of CMAG, who called the advertising war ''a blowout'' in Mr. Obama's favor.
 Based on his current spending, CMAG predicts Mr. Obama's general election advertising campaign will surpass the $188 million Mr. Bush spent in his 2004 campaign by early next week. Mr. McCain has spent $91 million on advertising since he clinched his party's nomination, several months before Mr. Obama clinched his. 
 The size of the disparity has even surprised aides to Mr. McCain, who traded accusations with Mr. Obama over the advertising battle in this week's debate, with Mr. Obama telling Mr. McCain that ''your ads, 100 percent of them have been negative'' and Mr. McCain saying that ''Senator Obama has spent more money on negative ads than any political campaign in history.''
 The most recent analysis of the presidential advertisements by the University of Wisconsin, based on the period from Sept. 28 through Oct. 4, found that nearly 100 percent of Mr. McCain's commercials included an attack on Mr. Obama and that 34 percent of Mr. Obama's advertisements, which were more focused that week on promoting his agenda, included an attack on Mr. McCain. 
 That finding reflected the McCain campaign's strategy of trying to make Mr. Obama an unacceptable choice in the eyes of undecided voters and Mr. Obama's goal of making undecided voters comfortable with him.
 But the Wisconsin Advertising Project says that since Mr. Obama wrapped up the Democratic nomination in June, 54 percent of Mr. McCain's advertisements have been completely focused on attacking him, roughly a quarter have mixed criticism of Mr. Obama with a positive message about Mr. McCain, and 20 percent have been devoted solely to promoting Mr. McCain.
 In the same period, the study found that 41 percent of Mr. Obama's advertisements had been devoted solely to attacking Mr. McCain, one-fifth mixed criticism of Mr. McCain with a positive message about Mr. Obama, and 38 percent were solely devoted to promoting Mr. Obama. 
 The group reported that Mr. Obama has also had several weeks in which his advertising was nearly 100 percent negative or contrast advertisements, though considerably fewer such weeks than Mr. McCain has had.
 The percentages do not reflect the vastly greater number of spots run by Mr. Obama. But Mr. Goldstein said Mr. McCain had shown more purely negative advertisements than Mr. Obama had, in spite of Mr. Obama's spending advantage. 
 Here in Philadelphia, the biggest media market in a critical state, both candidates showed a mix of positive and negative advertisements on Friday. The spots seemed to show up across the dial as regularly as the affable Geico gecko or the ambling ne'er-do-wells of FreeCreditReport.com. 
 During ''Dr. Phil'' on the CBS affiliate here, Mr. Obama showed a minute-long positive commercial recounting ''one of my earliest memories: going with Grandfather to see some of the astronauts, being brought back after a splashdown, sitting on his shoulders and waving a little American flag.'' 
 But minutes earlier during the late afternoon news on the NBC station, Mr. Obama had criticized Mr. McCain over a health care plan that an announcer alleges ''could leave you hanging by a thread.''
 Toward the end of the 4 p.m. newscast on the CBS station, Mr. McCain ran one of his rare purely positive spots, speaking directly into the camera and telling viewers, ''The last eight years haven't worked very well, have they?'' He promises, ''I have a plan for a new direction for the economy.''
 But on the NBC affiliate an advertisement approved by Mr. McCain was tying Mr. Obama to Antoin Rezko, a Chicago real estate developer convicted of fraud who is listed as among the friends Mr. Obama is said to reward ''with your tax dollars.''
 That spot was co-sponsored by the Republican National Committee, which is allowed to split the costs with Mr. McCain on an unlimited number of advertisements, helping him to double the number of advertisements he can buy. 
 Mr. McCain has used such advertisements to keep up with Mr. Obama's advertising in vital cities like this one, where the campaigns have combined to spend the most in the general election but where Mr. Obama has recently outpaced Mr. McCain by nearly two to one. But such advertisements come with a caveat: they must include a reference to Congressional issues and leaders, making the message generally less direct. 
 The spot with Mr. Rezko also shows the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, and Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts.
 But for every city like Philadelphia, in a state Mr. McCain views as important to his chances for victory, there are those like Miami, Washington and Chicago, where Mr. Obama has often been able to run advertisements nearly unopposed. Washington and Chicago are particularly expensive, and Mr. Obama will easily win both. But their stations reach parts of the contested states of Indiana and Virginia.
 Mr. McCain is also getting help from the Republican Party's independent advertising unit, but it cannot coordinate with the party leadership or Mr. McCain's campaign, meaning it is not always in line with Mr. McCain's campaign message. And a smattering of outside groups are running hard-charging advertisements against Mr. Obama, but he has the money to immediately meet those attacks with spots directly addressing their charges.
 Now spending almost as much as he can in local television markets, Mr. Obama has increased his advertising on the broadcast television networks, including on National Football League games and soap operas.
 ''They're doing the networks'' said Mr. Tracey, of CMAG, ''because they've saturated these markets and they're looking for more time.''
 Last Sunday, Mr. Obama bought so heavily on football games and other nationally televised programs that, according to CMAG, he spent $6.5 million on a day when Mr. McCain spent less than $1 million.

HEADLINE: Bush Says Bailout Package Will Take Time

BYLINE: By JACK HEALY

 BODY:
President Bush warned on Friday that paralyzed credit markets would ''take a while'' to return to normal, but he again tried to reassure Americans that the federal government's $700 billion bailout was ''big enough and bold enough to work,'' and would accelerate a recovery. 
 Speaking before business leaders at the United States Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Bush pushed back against critics who have called the bailout an expansion of government power tantamount to socialism. He insisted that the emergency measures, which include the government taking ownership stakes in some banks, were only undertaken as a ''last resort.''
 ''The government intervention is not a government takeover,'' Mr. Bush said. ''Its purpose is not to weaken the free market. It is to preserve the free market.''
 President Bush's message was similar to those throughout the week by other Washington officials, including Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke.
 The theme of all of the comments is one of patience -- that the economy has some difficult times ahead but that the package in place will eventually help lead to a recover.
 He said the government intervened only as a last resort to prevent the crisis in stock and lending markets from spiraling out of control.
 ''I know many Americans have reservations about their government's approach,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I would oppose such measures under ordinary circumstances. But these are not ordinary circumstances.''
 While the measures represent ''an extraordinary response to an extraordinary crisis,'' the president said they would be limited in size, scope and duration, and he said the government would recoup much of its $700 billion investment in troubled assets and financial institutions. 
 While the Treasury Department has pledged $250 billion to buy equity in large and small banks, Mr. Bush said the government would buy only a small percentage of stock, and would not act as a voting shareholder. He said the government would collect dividends and would encourage banks to buy back publicly held shares by increasing the government's dividend after five years. 
 Mr. Bush's speech preceded the opening of financial markets, which have swung wildly all week as investors fret about whether the government actions can help avoid a deep recession. Financial markets in New York opened lower Friday morning but had recouped most of their early losses by noon. 
 Shares have remained in a tumult even after Congress passed the $700 billion financial bailout on Oct. 1. Mr. Bush and other global leaders have made dozens of public statements to reassure jittery investors and lenders, pledging to do anything necessary to quell the crisis.

HEADLINE: Is Anybody Happy?

BYLINE: By GAIL COLLINS

 BODY:
Now is the October of our discontent.
First of all, George W. Bush showed up on TV Friday morning to reassure the nation. What could possibly be worse?
Everybody knows that anything our president says is very likely wrong, and certainly won't happen. If he announced: ''I'm sending government agents to Spokane to arrest the looters,'' we would expect that the officials would get lost, nobody would be arrested, and the looters probably never existed in the first place.
So hearts sunk throughout the nation when Bush appeared at a Chamber of Commerce gathering to say that the economy would recover. 
''America is the most attractive destination for investors around the globe. America is the home of the most talented and enterprising and creative workers in the world,'' said the president, who also insisted that ''democratic capitalism remains the greatest system ever devised.''
Which translates into: all the money is going to Asia, nobody will ever get a job again and Karl Marx was right after all.
Bummer.
Americans are also in a very low state about the presidential elections. Once again we've hit that magic moment when both sides are sure they're going to lose.
The Republicans are deeply depressed. Only Sarah Palin is chipper, perhaps because, as she told her supporters, the staff won't let her watch the news.
The Democrats are terrified. They're convinced something terrible is going to happen because something terrible always happens. Look at 2000! Look at 2004! All the exit polls said it was going to be Kerry and then he lost. How could that happen? Because God hates Democrats, that's why.
It's like the curse of the Bambino. The Democrats fear they're under a jinx because they committed some sin, the political equivalent of trading away Babe Ruth. If so, it probably started with nominating Joe Lieberman for vice president.
The only people who seem to have faith that Barack Obama can pull this off are the Republicans. They thought McCain did well in the final debate and were crushed when viewers only saw his rolling eyes and glares.
Maybe McCain's problem is not his temperament but his positions. It's hard to be cheerful and self-satisfied when you're peddling an unpopular product.
This week, when McCain made appearances at the Al Smith dinner and ''The Late Show With David Letterman,'' he was funny and self-deprecating. Suddenly you remembered -- this guy used to be likeable. Back before he was trying to argue that what a country in economic collapse needs most is tax cuts for the rich and an end to Senate earmarks.
With less than three weeks to go, saddled with an unpopular ideology and an unattractive candidate, the McCain campaign's deep thinkers decided the only possible hope was ...
Joe the Plumber! Joe is, of course, the conservative guy from northwestern Ohio who told Obama: ''Your new tax plan is going to tax me more'' because he planned to buy a business that he hoped would reel in more than $250,000 a year in profits.
The proper answer, as Obama should have known, was: ''No, it won't.''
Instead, he engaged JtheP in conversation, remarking that it might be helpful in this time of crisis to ''spread the wealth around'' a little. Since this was before George W. Bush put the nail into the coffin of capitalism at the Chamber of Commerce speech, Joe was appalled.
The Republican presidential campaign is now all Joe, all the time. Obama's plan to give tax breaks to people making less than $200,000 a year is being described on a McCain Internet ad as ''welfare government handouts.'' In Miami, Lieberman told a rally that McCain would ''fight for Jose el plomero!''
Meanwhile, Joe was happily standing in his front yard, holding forth to the assembled national news media on his theories about everything from Social Security (bad) to the war in Iraq (good). And do not condemn him, people, unless you imagine that if all the cable television reporters in the world were in your driveway, begging for your opinion on the state of the nation, you would say: ''No, I leave that to the experts.''
You should, however, understand that once the interview is over, the reporters will go down the street and ask the sanitation man whether you've ever failed to recycle.
Joe the Plumber, it turns out, is actually named Samuel and is not a licensed plumber. He has a lien on his house for unpaid taxes. While his professional life is still a little hazy, there is not much evidence he's ever going to become a small business owner. And he would be a beneficiary of the Barack Obama tax plan.
I think the lessons here are very clear:
1) Do not organize your presidential campaign around a guy you've only seen on YouTube.
2) Before you become a media sensation, examine your conscience and start separating the bottles and newspapers.
3) Never let George W. Bush mention you at a Chamber of Commerce speech.

HEADLINE: A Slow Economy and New Voters Are Helping Obama's Chances in Missouri

BYLINE: By ADAM NOSSITER

 BODY:
STEELVILLE, Mo. -- Missouri is on a political knife-edge. For weeks, Senator Barack Obama has been inching up in the polls here, and some analysts now believe he is slightly ahead.
Mr. Obama's campaign had refused to concede this bellwether state despite remaining behind in the polls for months, manning dozens of offices across rural areas and sending some 2,000 volunteers door-to-door seeking support for him.
At this point four years ago, Senator John Kerry, the Democratic presidential nominee, had all but conceded the state, but the Obama campaign's effort has been unrelenting. About 250,000 voters have been added to the Missouri rolls since January, many -- perhaps most -- in the urban areas of Kansas City and St. Louis, where Mr. Obama is expected to win by overwhelming margins.
''I've never seen this kind of infrastructure being laid down, registering new voters,'' said Clint Zweifel, a Democratic state representative who is running for state treasurer. ''It's pretty overwhelming, the operation.'' 
Missouri, the crossroads between three distinctive regions, has supported the presidential winner nationwide all but once in the last 100 years, and Republican officials here say Senator John McCain cannot afford to lose the state.
But the Democrats' grass-roots effort, along with the bad economic news, may be paying off. Mr. Obama has pulled even with Mr. McCain in the latest CNN/Time/Opinion Research poll, released on Tuesday. David Robertson, a political scientist at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said he believed that the state was now leaning toward Mr. Obama, and that support for Mr. Obama ''could be changing before our eyes.''
''It could be increasing,'' Mr. Robertson said.
That represents a sharp reversal from this summer, when whites in the state's conservative rural and exurban areas put Mr. McCain squarely in the lead. With a hybrid of Midwestern and Southern attitudes, such voters helped President Bush win the state in 2000 and 2004, the last time by nearly three percentage points above his national average.
Now Mr. McCain has been forced to redouble his efforts, expanding the number of offices here over the last month to 16, from 10, party officials said.
''Every day, the level of commitment from the McCain campaign increases,'' said Jared Craighead, executive director of the state Republican Party, conceding that ''it's very difficult to put together a map for Senator McCain where he doesn't get Missouri.''
The candidates and their surrogates have visited the state repeatedly. Mr. Obama will give a speech Saturday at the Gateway Arch in St. Louis, Mr. McCain is scheduled to visit the state on Monday, Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democratic vice-presidential nominee, was here last week, and Mr. Biden's wife, Jill, will be here this weekend.
Registration on the Republican side appears to be down in traditionally conservative bastions in the southeastern part of the state, Mr. Robertson said. ''The Republicans seem to be discouraged,'' he said.
Still, they are far from giving up. Mr. Obama's momentum notwithstanding, the prevailing mood is one of uncertainty, from coffee houses to the suites of political professionals in the suburbs to main street offices like that of Dan Hale, a lawyer here in the east-central country town of Steelville.
''I'm not convinced my prediction is correct,'' Mr. Hale said, having cautiously just forecast that Mr. Obama would win the state in a squeaker.
Nobody is willing to place a no-fail bet on the outcome, largely because of exurban and rural spots like this one.
There are still substantial hurdles for Mr. Obama. Evangelicals, at 37 percent of the population, are a solid base for the Republicans, and in the Democratic primary, Mr. Obama lost all but five counties, two of which contained the state's biggest cities, St. Louis and Kansas City.
He still narrowly won the primary, but general election winners are rarely decided in Missouri's cities. Rural Missouri, where at least 30 percent of the population lives, and the towns between Kansas City and St. Louis pose a challenge to Mr. Obama. Bill Clinton won Crawford County, whose county seat is Steelville, in 1996, but the county has gone Republican, like the state, ever since.
''It won't be easy for people to vote for Obama,'' Mr. Hale said, looking out over the modest brick courthouse in this old mining town, population 1,445, about 75 miles southwest of St. Louis. ''There's concern that Obama is associated with people that don't like us, and don't look like us.''
The deal is not closed in a state that deserves its reputation for cautious deliberation.
''I have mixed emotions about it; I haven't made up my mind,'' said Jack Billingsley, a car salesman up the street from Mr. Hale who usually votes Republican. Crawford County was strictly Republican a few years ago, Mr. Billingsley said. ''But it's not like that this year.''
Mr. Obama has clung tenaciously to his goal of capturing votes in these rolling hills and tenuous downtowns. His field director in nearby Rolla, population 17,000, works out of a storefront where the window's unassuming Obama sign shares inconspicuous billing with local candidates. Mr. Obama made a campaign stop in Rolla this summer. Two years ago, Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, made inroads by campaigning relentlessly in country areas that had been all but conceded for good to the Republicans. She narrowed margins in solid Republican counties in conservative southwestern Missouri, and even picked up a few elsewhere.
''It is a very, very competitive state,'' said David Webber, a political science professor at the University of Missouri.
The state's economy is fraying. The unemployment rate in July was Missouri's highest in 17 years, and a small-machines factory in Rolla that employed 800 closed last year.
These developments suggest why Mr. Obama's television spending in Missouri over several weeks in September outpaced Mr. McCain's by about a third -- Mr. Kerry was pulling advertisements off the air in the state at this point four years ago -- and why even some Republican experts can construct scenarios in which McCain loses the state.
Officially, Republicans say Mr. Obama's ''liberal message,'' as Mr. Craighead, the state party director, put it, rules him out in Missouri.
Unofficially, other factors are in play.
''It's all going to turn on, will the same young voters who put Obama over the top in the primary turn out again?'' said Paul Zemitzsch, a veteran Republican consultant in the state.
Meanwhile, older voters, more resistant to the Democratic nominee, are being softened up by the fragile economic climate. ''The banking crisis has shaken up people in the rural area,'' said Joe Maxwell, a former Democratic lieutenant governor and now a lawyer in Mexico, Mo., who has been stumping the country roads for Mr. Obama.
To win the state, Mr. Obama must capture swing exurban counties, like Jefferson and Washington in the east, and blue-collar, union-heavy areas south of St. Louis that were taken by Mr. Clinton, Al Gore and Mrs. McCaskill, but lost by Mr. Kerry. The state of the economy is giving Mr. Obama an audience.
''Nobody around here likes the Republicans,'' said John Burt, a union carpenter, in the parking lot of a Country Mart store in De Soto, south of St. Louis. Mr. Bush ''didn't do nothing right,'' Mr. Burt said. ''He's for the rich person.''
Up the road at a Wal-Mart, Mike Bosler, a beer truck driver, said he thought Mr. Obama had ''a better feel for what it's like to be from the predominant class of Americans.''
''McCain just seems like he was born and raised a rich kid,'' Mr. Bosler said.
Deeper into rural Washington County, ''people don't know what to do'' about the election, said Tim Gillam, a mail carrier filling his car with gas in Old Mines. ''They're undecided.''
The cultural barriers for a Democrat, though, are real. ''I'm still not sure they're going to overcome past Republican rhetoric, particularly around the gun and abortion issue,'' said State Senator Frank A. Barnitz, a Democrat from the rural Ozarks. ''In this region, it is a very, very big hurdle.
Warren Nelson, a trucker in De Soto, described himself as ''a little bit prejudiced'' in explaining his opposition to Mr. Obama, adding that Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska made Mr. McCain's ticket a powerful draw.
Ms. Palin has added to the state's indecision by attracting some conservative Democrats who had been drawn to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton in the primary.
''There's a lot of women that maybe have different beliefs than Sarah, but they're pretty fascinated that, 'Oh my gosh, we have a woman who could be No. 2,' '' said State Representative Belinda Harris, a Democratic from the rural end of Jefferson County, south of St. Louis.
''I really haven't quite decided yet,'' Ms. Harris added.
STATESIDE: This is part of an occasional series of articles tracking the pace of the presidential race in states across the country.
Correction: October 21, 2008, Tuesday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on Friday about Senator Barack Obama's recent electoral gains in Missouri omitted three areas of the state he won in the Democratic presidential primary. In addition to winning the cities of St. Louis and Kansas City, he also won Boone, Cole and Nodaway Counties. He did not lose ''everywhere but the two big cities.''

HEADLINE: Campaigns Tangle Over Health Care

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
In a coordinated air and ground attack, Senator Barack Obama has charged that his Republican rival for the presidency, Senator John McCain, would make $882 billion in ''drastic cuts to Medicare'' to pay for his health care proposal.
 That assertion, which could resonate among elderly voters in crucial swing states like Florida, is being angrily disputed by the McCain campaign. Mr. McCain's top domestic policy adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, said Friday that the Democrat's latest assault on the McCain health plan constituted the ''worst and most sustained distortion of policy in this entire campaign.'' 
 In fact, the Obama campaign's new television advertisement, which Mr. Obama reinforced on the stump in Roanoke, Va., does mischaracterize Mr. McCain's plan by stitching together vague language from a news report with back-of-the envelope calculations by a partisan policy group.
 The Obama Medicare ad asserts that the McCain plan would require ''cuts in benefits, eligibility or both.'' In his speech, Mr. Obama added that ''it would mean a cut of more than 20 percent in Medicare benefits next year.'' 
 ''If you count on Medicare,'' he said, ''it would mean fewer places to get care, and less freedom to choose your own doctors. You'll pay more for your drugs, receive fewer services, and get lower quality care.'' 
 But Mr. McCain has not suggested cutting Medicare benefits, though it is always possible he might find it necessary to make his plan pay for itself. Rather, Mr. Holtz-Eakin said Friday that Mr. McCain would fill any budget hole in the plan through a variety of changes that would largely leave benefit levels untouched. And he pointed out that Mr. Obama supports many of the same changes.
 Among the cost-saving measures listed by Mr. Holtz-Eakin in a conference call with reporters Friday were accelerating the computerization of health records, eliminating fraudulent Medicare claims, requiring high-income beneficiaries to pay more for pharmaceuticals, speeding the use of generic drugs, and eliminating government subsidies for private Medicare Advantage plans. He also spoke, as Mr. Obama often does, of saving money through more effective treatment of chronic diseases and reconfiguring the Medicare payment system to emphasize prevention and primary care. 
 Economists agree that many of those initiatives should save money over the long term, but estimates of how much and how fast are varied and totally speculative. Nonetheless, both candidates rely on such guesswork to present plans that appear fiscally balanced. 
 The centerpiece of Mr. McCain's plan, which is intended to make the insurance markets more equitable and competitive, is the elimination of the provision that allows workers to exclude the value of employer-sponsored health benefits from taxable income. That tax advantage, often worth thousands of dollars a year, is not available to those who buy insurance individually. In exchange, Mr. McCain would offer all consumers tax credits of $2,500 per individual or $5,000 per family to purchase health coverage.
 Mr. McCain's aides have long asserted that their plan would not add to net government spending. But in July, the Tax Policy Center, a group of analysts from the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, estimated that the change in tax treatment would cost the government $1.3 trillion over 10 years. Mr. Obama's plan to subsidize coverage for low-income workers was estimated to cost $1.6 trillion.
 The Tax Policy Center analysts wrote that they had not evaluated whether the health care savings proposed by either candidate would be sufficient to fill the gaps in their plans.
 Last week, an article in The Wall Street Journal reported that Mr. Holtz-Eakin said any budgetary hole would be filled with reductions to Medicare and Medicaid, without providing much detail. The next day, the Center for American Progress Action Fund, which is led by John D. Podesta, former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, issued a report asserting that a proportional cut would mean eliminating $882 billion from Medicare and $419 billion from Medicaid. 
 The Obama ad released Friday cites both the Journal article and the Center for American Progress study. Mr. Obama used the $882 billion figure in his speech without attributing it to the center, which primarily advocates for Democratic positions.
 Mr. Holtz-Eakin declined Friday to either accept or reject the Tax Policy Center estimate of the McCain plan's cost. ''We believe and have believed from the day we rolled out our health care plan that the comprehensive reforms are budget-neutral,'' he said.
 He emphasized, however, that any reductions would not touch benefits. ''No service is being reduced,'' he said. Every beneficiary, now and in the future, will see exactly the same benefits they have been promised.'' 
 As for Mr. Obama's assertions, he said, ''It's an attempt to simply scare America's seniors.''

HEADLINE: Stocks Dive! A Chance, Perhaps, to View Art in Moscow

BYLINE: SOPHIA KISHKOVSKY


HIGHLIGHT: I mentioned in my last posting that judging by recent visits to a major Moscow shopping mall, it's impossible to tell that the financial crisis has hit the Russian capital. 

 BODY:
I mentioned in my last posting that judging by recent visits to a major Moscow shopping mall, it's impossible to tell that the financial crisis has hit the Russian capital. 
And, unless you eavesdrop very closely, the same goes for the pre-auction showings that Sotheby's and Christie's have been holding in Moscow before the big fall and spring sales in London and New York. The Sotheby's preview in Moscow runs through Sunday. It is, of course, by invitation only, but give it a shot, and call Sotheby's Moscow office. Potential buyers are at a premium these days. Or, you can put on your best oligarch face - and shoes - and try to saunter in.
Although, by Bloomberg's estimates, Russia's top 25 Forbes-list billionaires have lost nearly $240 billion to the financial crisis, Moscow's rich are still flaunting their oil and commodities fortunes and the auction houses are pinning great hopes on their continuing interest in art and purchasing power.
We'll see how long that lasts, but this week both Sotheby's and Christie's held auction previews at restored pre-revolutionary mansions in central Moscow. I attended Sotheby's events, held in a mansion that had been turned into the headquarters of the Union of Artists of the USSR. Now it's opening as the State Museum of Modern Art of the Russian Academy of Arts.
The academy's president is Zurab Tsereteli, the Georgian sculptor who is often criticized for his kitschiness and close ties to Moscow's powerful Mayor Yuri Luzhkov.
He has already opened the Moscow Museum of Modern Art (www.mmoma.ru), which has three branches and has gained respect in recent years thanks to Vasily Tsereteli, his American-educated grandson who is the museum's director and a force on Moscow's contemporary art scene.
It remains to be seen what exhibitions the new branch will offer - the elder Tsereteli has already left his mark on the facility by building a glass pyramid chapel in the elegant old building's courtyard - but it's already made its mark by opening its doors and offering its walls to the Sotheby's preview.
The museum's second floor was filled with everything from works by Andy Warhol, Jeff Koons and Francis Bacon, to Picasso, Matisse and Degas, Kandinsky and Malevich, and a number of pre-revolutionary and migr artists, such as Ivan Aivazovsky and Boris Grigoriev, who are popular with rich Russian collectors.
It was a museum quality show, and the showings were social events. The showing on Wednesday was meant for the super-VIPs - an intimate gathering of oligarchs, their art dealers and designer-bedecked wives and girlfriends -- but through a friend's timely invitation I found myself there too. It looked like a crisis-immune scene, but I did overhear some chatter about the dire financial situation. One businessman known for his Russian contemporary art collection said as he left: ``Half my business is secure, but I must now go save the other half."
Thursday's reception for lesser VIP's (the Champagne was definitely not as good as Wednesday's) was packed. Who doesn't like a free party, and some beautiful art, in tough times? In a few weeks we will know to what extent the crisis has dented rich Russians' willingness to shell out for art. 
If you don't get to see the show this time, you can always try again in the spring. The stock market - and art market - are sure to hold many more surprises in the coming months.

HEADLINE: Capitalism to the Rescue

 BODY:
Jon Gertner (Oct. 5) fails to make explicit the crucial role of oft-derided government regulation in harnessing private enterprise for public good. Public policy can anticipate societal needs not detected by economic forces. Venture-capital firms with green-tech funds like Kleiner Perkins serve a valuable role, but must provide short-term (5- to 10-year) returns in an economy in which the benefits of those investments will be long-term. (Paradoxically, part of the bet of green-tech investment is that government policy, like a carbon tax, will catch up to societal needs.) In the coming decades, it might turn out that doing the most good will be manifestly more important than maximizing return on investment and that waiting for the market to respond to the need for action will mean waiting too long. 
PAUL FLIKKEMA
Flagstaff, Ariz.
While Wall Street cries ''uncle'' and market speculation jolts the price of staple commodities, Gertner's description of available technology that meets actual needs of a daunting global population is an encouragement toward new job markets and more effective ways to power, move and house ourselves. The venture capitalists backing these new designs are not in their business for the sake of social responsibility, but they represent the wheels of the free market turning around companies that will impact the way we perceive business, energy and sustainability. As a college student approaching the threshold of graduation, I find it heartening to read that some aspects of our current system are working in our favor, working to align our economy and ecology.

HEADLINE: 29th on Infant Mortality

 BODY:
After five years of stagnation, the United States has managed to cut its infant mortality a bit. That is no great cause for celebration, especially since this country's rates remain far too high and so many other countries are doing so much better on this important measure of a nation's health and the quality of its medical system. 
 The infant mortality rate in this country declined sharply in the 20th century but then plateaued from 2000 to 2005. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported last week that in 2006 the rate of infant deaths in the United States fell to 6.71 per 1,000 live births, down from 6.86 the previous year. That is still 50 percent higher than the official national goal of 4.5 deaths per thousand.
 What is particularly shameful is how poorly this country compares with other industrialized countries. In 1960, the United States ranked 12th lowest in the world in infant mortality. By 2004, the last year for which comparative data are available, it had dropped to 29th, tied with Poland and Slovakia. Even with the improvement, it is still likely to rank 29th, far behind many Scandinavian and East Asian countries that report rates below 3.5.
 Infant mortality is associated with many factors, including the health and economic status of the mother, her race or ethnicity, access to quality medical care, and such cultural problems as rising obesity and drug use. 
 That makes it difficult to identify the cause of the United States' poor performance. Some researchers blame an increase in premature births, many by Caesarean section. The chief lesson we draw is that the American health care system, despite the highest expenditures in the world, is badly in need of an overhaul.

HEADLINE: A Cheap Lunch Takes a Hit

BYLINE: By JAKE MOONEY

 BODY:
AS economic indicators, the myriad colored signs above the registers at Gray's Papaya, the Manhattan hot dog chain, leave something to be desired. They have advertised the stores' ''Recession Special'' -- two franks and a drink (anything but pineapple and orange) -- since the late 1980s, through boom and bust, high times and low. 
If the signs have looked sadly appropriate at some moments in their history, there have been other times, like the days of the dot-com bubble and the current decade's real estate gold rush, when the idea of a recession-related discount may have felt a tad outdated. A deal is always nice, but a recession? In better days, it seemed a stretch.
But no more. With the stock market's recent slide and the continuing financial crisis, fears of a recession are back, and the signs at Gray's, like a stopped clock, are looking timely again. Not that Nicholas Gray, the chain's founder and its resident sage, is happy to be right.
''I'm as suicidal as everybody else,'' Mr. Gray said with a sigh in a recent phone interview.
In fact, he added, the downturn will soon force a shift in one aspect of the recession special: the price. This week, the special will rise to $4.45 from $3.50, Mr. Gray said.
''Tell them I'm weeping as I do it,'' he said, adding, ''My prices are very low and my rents are very high, so I have a problem.'' Mr. Gray blamed the rising wholesale cost of food, and lamented the price increase's timing, which he called ''the worst.''
The cost of the special has risen before. When it started, Mr. Gray said, ''we used to say, 'For the recession that's over and the one that's still to come.' '' The price was $1.95 through most of the '90s, then jumped to $2.45 in 2002, then to $2.75, and to $3.50 in 2006, all with regrets from Mr. Gray.
''It's always very traumatic for me as well as for the customers,'' he said.
At the store at 72nd Street and Broadway one afternoon last week, business seemed fine. There was a short line, all the spots to stand and eat by the windows were occupied, and a crowd was around the mustard pump.
The appeal of a cheap lunch is timeless, Mr. Gray said. Besides, he added, ''it's always a recession for my customers, you know.''

Wants for Sale
 The price of a painting, like the price of any object, can be set in any number of ways. Of course, that price doesn't mean anything until someone agrees to pay it; the market always gets the last word. But you have to start somewhere, and for Justin Gignac and Christine Santora, a pricing strategy is at the center of their efforts to sell paintings. In fact, their paintings are basically about what things cost. 
 The couple -- art directors in the advertising business in New York -- wanted to work together on a creative project. Part of their motivation was to make a little extra money, and talking about what they might do with it, Santora says, led them to the strategy of ''why don't we just be totally transparent?'' If they wanted to make enough to buy a plate of buffalo wings at Le Figaro Cafe (now defunct) on Bleecker Street, they would render a plate a buffalo wings and charge $12.70. If they wanted a Wii, they would paint one and charge $270.92. 
 They made a first batch of 13 paintings about a year ago, built a Web site called wantsforsale.com and sent instant messages to 30 friends. Within a week their project was mentioned on a variety of blogs and on DailyCandy, the popular trend-spotting e-mail newsletter. Most of the works were promptly snapped up, including ''One Month's Rent,'' which depicted a check for $1,056.07 and cost the buyer $1,056.07. (One painting from that debut collection, titled ''Financial Security,'' is still available for $1 million.) 
 Since then, the couple have regularly released new batches of paintings, and informed potential buyers by way of an e-mail list. Each batch includes a selection of items that range in price from the very cheap to a few thousand dollars. (They also created a parallel Web site called needsforsale.com, with paintings from $100 to $500, each tied to a specific charity or nonprofit group like Toys for Tots or City Harvest that receives the full payment.) Santora, who works at the ad agency Mother, and Gignac, who freelances for various agencies, dream up their list of wants together, make individual sketches, then collaborate on simplifying the image they want to produce -- and often take turns working on the same canvas. Gignac has also experimented with art, commerce and value through his ''New York City Garbage Sculptures,'' which consist of actual trash presented in clear boxes that sell for $50. He says the simplified aesthetic of Wants for Sale was chosen specifically to ''make it impossible to tell that two people had worked on'' each painting. 
 Santora says the couple's ''wants'' have evolved to include more experiences than objects. One group of paintings encompassed various aspects of a trip to Las Vegas -- $201.40 ''To See Showgirls,'' $200 to play slots, $9.99 for aspirin and so on. Their newest group of paintings, finished in late September, includes ''Pinkberry With Banana and Chocolate Chips'' for $5.85 and cooking lessons for $220; those go on sale later this month. It's always interesting, the pair say, to see the order in which paintings sell. For example, ''Dinner at Nobu'' sold for $152 before ''A Slice of Pepperoni,'' a $3 painting in the same set. The latter obviously seems like the bargain, given that all the paintings are of similar size and took similar amounts of effort to produce. 
 Santora speculates that whatever it is that motivates somebody to pay more for one than another, it must not be aesthetics alone but some kind of personal connection to the painting's subject: certain gamer geeks might like the idea of a Wii or Guitar Hero attachment in portrait form. Their customers, some of whom have bought more than one painting, are clearly drawn to the overall concept and perhaps will pay more for its wittier iterations (like the relatively pricey month's rent). In any case, they have tended not to be traditional art collectors. ''We're not really sure what the art community thinks about it,'' Gignac says. But having built their ''brand'' a bit, as he puts it, they're interested in finding out and have been mulling a few ideas that might work in a gallery setting. (Another of their unsold works is a painting of the phrase ''Instant Street Cred,'' with the ''want'' described as: ''Charles Saatchi to Buy This Painting.'')
 Meanwhile, even those with the shakiest grasp on economics can guess that there are far more efficient ways to earn the price of a plate of wings. In fact, Gignac concedes that even the Vegas trip probably took more effort to underwrite with paintings than it would have by simply taking a few extra freelance jobs. So far, in other words, the real payoff of ''Wants for Sale'' hasn't been material but creative -- the kind of reward that's tough to reduce to dollars and cents.

HEADLINE: Prepay a Mortgage? It Depends

BYLINE: By BOB TEDESCHI

 BODY:
HOMEOWNERS with an aversion to debt are sometimes tempted to pay down their mortgages before they come due. That can be a misguided approach, some financial counselors say, if borrowers can instead put that money into relatively safe investments that produce a higher rate of return than the interest rate they are paying on their mortgages.
 In the current financial environment, however, prepaying on a mortgage might make sense. 
 With the securities markets plunging early this month, there have been few well-paying safe harbors for investors, making early mortgage payments more enticing than might otherwise be the case. 
 ''As usual, a lot of this depends on your risk appetite,'' said Jonathan M. Satovsky, chief executive officer of Satovsky Asset Management, a financial counseling service based in Manhattan.
 The strategy of paying down mortgage principal ahead of schedule makes sense only for those with good cash flow and job security, according to financial counselors and mortgage planners. 
 Even for the relatively rare mortgages that have prepayment penalties, such charges typically apply only when a holder completely pays off a mortgage ahead of schedule. There is no penalty for adding a few hundred dollars to a monthly payment. 
 A key to figuring out whether to prepay a mortgage is estimating the net interest burden. For homeowners with fixed-rate mortgages of about 6 percent, the net interest burden after taxes is probably around 4 percent. Borrowers should consider making payments if they cannot find an investment instrument that has a higher rate of appreciation.
 As of early October, Mr. Satovsky said the only investments fitting that description were tax-free municipal bonds, like New York State's general obligation bond paying between 5 percent and 5.5 percent. Even there, investors would have to live with the possibility, however remote, that a municipality might default on the bond.
 The 10-year United States Treasury bond was paying about 3.8 percent this month, and that income is taxable on federal returns. Shorter-term Treasury notes earned significantly less.
 It should be noted that owning a bigger stake in a home does not, in itself, offer an investment benefit -- even if you happen to live in an area of rising home values. If you buy a $250,000 home with cash, for instance, and the home's value doubles, your initial investment has doubled. If, however, you had taken out a loan for $200,000, your initial investment of $50,000 in cash would have multiplied tenfold. 
 Those who live in areas of declining home values could benefit from increasing the equity in their homes, if, for instance, the equity is less than 20 percent of the value of the house. At that point, banks typically require borrowers to obtain private mortgage insurance, which can cost $100 or more a month.
 One consideration that borrowers should take into account when contemplating extra mortgage payments, Mr. Satovsky said, is future cash flow. ''What if you pay down your mortgage but then you get laid off?'' he asked. ''What do you do then?''
 One answer is a home equity line of credit. This offers a smart hedge for owners prepaying on their mortgages, since they give borrowers quick access to tens of thousands of dollars. Lines of credit are akin to credit cards, but they carry interest rates that are much lower. 
 Currently, however, lenders are applying stricter scrutiny to home equity lines, and these credit lines can sometimes be shut down without warning.

HEADLINE: Swapping Secrecy for Transparency

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER COX. 
Christopher Cox is the chairman of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission.

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
 THE historic volatility in the financial markets has raised important questions about the lack of meaningful regulation of financial instruments known as credit-default swaps. The $85 billion government rescue last month of the insurance conglomerate American International Group, for example, was needed in large part to protect those who held A.I.G.'s credit-default swaps and risked crushing losses if those instruments weren't honored. 
 A.I.G. had issued $440 billion in credit-default swaps -- which are like insurance contracts on bonds and other assets that are meant to pay off if those assets default. But as markdowns on A.I.G.'s investments in subprime mortgages led to downgrades in its credit ratings, the holders of the credit-default swaps demanded more collateral, which A.I.G. could not provide. 
 As large as A.I.G.'s swaps exposure was, it represented only 0.8 percent of the $55 trillion in credit-default swaps outstanding -- this total market is more than the gross domestic product of all nations on earth combined. 
 Yet despite its enormous size, the credit-default swaps market has operated in the shadows. There is no public disclosure nor any legal requirement for these contracts to be reported to the Securities and Exchange Commission or any other agency. So government regulators have had no way to assess how much risk is in the system, whether credit-default swaps have been accurately valued or honestly traded, and when people issuing and trading them have taken on risk that threatens others.
 Because these instruments have been bought and sold widely and in many cases anonymously, they have trapped the large financial institutions in a web of transactions. This has created systemic risk that is particularly serious in the current stressful economic environment, contributing to a gravitational pull that stands to drag everyone down.
 All investors -- from individuals through their 401(k) plans to pension funds and asset managers -- are paying a price today for the lack of oversight. We must urgently address the problems created by this unregulated environment. 
 Credit-default swaps are not inherently good or evil. They play an important role in the smooth functioning of capital markets by allowing a broad range of institutional investors to manage the credit risks to which they are exposed. They are also a useful means for investors to signal their view of an entity's business prospects and creditworthiness.
 But our markets function best when they are highly transparent, when everyone can see exactly which transactions are occurring and what the instruments being traded are worth. This gives investors confidence that they can accurately assess risk. 
 Back in 2000, Congress specifically decided not to regulate credit-default swaps. At that time, this market was just a few years old and still very small. For example, in 1999 a report by the President's Working Group on Financial Markets envisioned no systemic risk from such derivatives since ''private counterparty discipline'' -- investors' natural desire to keep their own risks to a minimum -- would work to protect the broader financial system. 
 But the market for credit-default swaps has recently mushroomed. In just the past two years, it has doubled in size. And as the market has grown, private counterparty discipline has proven inadequate. As we have seen, individual market participants did not pay enough attention until it was too late.
 To place a value on credit-default swaps and the mortgage-related securities they insure, buyers and sellers of swaps relied too heavily on financial models that couldn't predict the mortgage market meltdown. They also trusted too much in the credit ratings of the securities and of the firms selling the credit-default swaps, and these ratings underestimated the risk. 
 Congress needs to fill this regulatory hole by passing legislation that would not only make credit-default swaps more transparent but also give regulators the power to rein in fraudulent or manipulative trading practices and help everyone better assess the risks involved.
 Congress could require that dealers in over-the-counter credit-default swaps publicly report both their trades and the value of those trades. This would make the market more transparent, and make it easier for everyone engaged in credit-default swaps to assess their value. It would also provide regulators with the information they need to uncover unfair or fraudulent practices and to monitor risk. 
 Then, the Securities and Exchange Commission should be given explicit authority to issue rules against fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative acts and practices in credit-default swaps.
 Finally, Congress could provide support for federal regulators to mandate the use of one or more central counterparties -- financially stable clearance and settlement organizations -- and exchange-like trading platforms for the credit-default swaps market. As it is now, it is often impossible even to know who stands on the other side of a swap contract, and this increases the risk involved. We at the S.E.C. are already working with the Federal Reserve, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and industry participants to accomplish these goals on a voluntary basis, using the authority we currently have.
 Because of the truly global nature of the over-the-counter derivatives market, we will need to work closely with governments in other major markets. The climate for such cooperation is good, because the cross-border impacts of the current market problems are obvious to all. 
 Transparency is a powerful antidote for what ails our capital markets. When investors have clear and accurate information, and when they can make informed decisions about where to put their resources, money and credit will begin to flow again. By giving regulators the authority they need to bring the credit derivatives market into the sunshine, we can take a giant step forward in protecting our financial system and the well-being of every American.

HEADLINE: Crisis Comes to Hungary in Loans of Francs and Euros

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH

DATELINE: BUDAPEST 

 BODY:
As the financial crisis rippled over Europe in recent weeks, Hungary found itself particularly vulnerable. The country -- once a favorite of Western investors -- is burdened with heavy debt. Worse yet, the government financed past spending sprees, in good part, with foreign currency loans that are growing ever more expensive as its own currency founders.
 Average Hungarians are also in trouble. They flocked in droves to banks here in the last several years for once-cheap loans in Swiss francs and euros to buy their cars and houses. Now, they find themselves exposed to rising debt payments.
 The government has taken steps to shore up its position in the midst of the credit crunch that has grown out of the crisis, lining up support last week from the International Monetary Fund and the European Central Bank. 
 But Hungarian consumers can do little more than hope their wobbly currency, the forint, stabilizes. 
 ''I can't do anything else,'' said Bori Bende, 26, who with her husband owns not one, but two apartments with mortgages denominated in the Swiss franc. The couple had bought a new, larger apartment and were in the process of selling their old one, a one-bedroom in an up-and-coming part of the city, when the credit markets tightened and scared buyers away.
 Borrowing in another currency, a mostly foreign concept for middle-class Americans, had become as simple here as walking into the nearest bank branch and applying for credit. The interest rates were lower. There was a risk, but only if the Hungarian currency declined relative to other currencies, forcing borrowers to pay increasing amounts to cover the same monthly bills. 
 That possibility did not stop nearly 90 percent of consumer borrowers this year from taking out their loans in Swiss francs or euros, according to the central bank. 
 Once the crisis hit, investors concerned about the stability of Eastern European economies began pulling their money out of the country, and risk became reality: the forint began to drop sharply, falling 10 percent against the euro and 13 percent against the Swiss franc this month.
 Although Hungary is in nowhere near as dire a situation as Iceland, where the government has seized control of several major banks, it has been marked as one of Europe's problem countries because of its debt, almost a third of which is in foreign currencies. As credit has dried up, growth targets have been cut, public spending is being curtailed and Hungary's benchmark stock index plunged, dropping close to 40 percent for the month.
 For Ms. Bende and her husband, the economic volatility means they are spending more than $500 a month to maintain an empty apartment. The small calendar in Ms. Bende's wallet tells the story, with hastily scribbled notes detailing the once-steady stream of potential buyers suddenly yielding to blank pages as inquiries ground to a halt last week.
 ''I work really hard, have two jobs, so I can afford it right now,'' she said. But in November the exchange rate for the mortgage on the apartment she and her husband are living in will adjust to reflect the forint's relative value, as it does every six months. In December, the rate will reset on the empty apartment. 
 Andras Simor, head of the National Bank of Hungary, said in an interview in his office here that the bank had campaigned for some time to slow foreign-exchange borrowing. ''If you borrow foreign exchange, you take a risk, but the public was not fully aware of the risk,'' he said. 
 Mr. Simor pointed out that Hungary's banks were not taking the same chances as those in the United States, where mortgages were given out with little money down or scant documentation. 
 But Hungary's banks were making their decisions about offering foreign exchange loans before the economic crisis began buffeting Europe and raised questions about Eastern Europe in particular. 
 While experts said some countries, like Slovakia, the Czech Republic and Poland, had used their borrowing to expand their export capacity and long-term competitiveness, others, most notably the Baltic nations, had put more of their borrowing into houses and shopping malls. 
 But almost all the countries in the region feel somewhat exposed and worry that they could fall prey to the same problems affecting Hungary and Ukraine, which is in talks with the International Monetary Fund. 
 ''If this whole thing gets worse, then inevitably more innocent bystanders will get hit,'' said Christoph B. Rosenberg, head of the I.M.F.'s office for Central and Eastern Europe.
 Hungary was long considered the least socialist of the socialist countries. Even before the end of Soviet hegemony in the region, Hungary allowed a greater measure of free enterprise than others in the bloc, with its so-called ''goulash Communism'' system. After the fall of Communism, the country quickly established itself as the leading destination in the region for Western investors.
 In 2004, along with its Central European neighbors and the Baltic countries, Hungary joined the European Union, an important step toward shedding the label of an emerging market. But the government had grown profligate, and deficit spending reached a peak in 2006 of 9.3 percent of the country's economy. It is a sad bit of hindsight for policy makers here that they had already begun taking steps to get their spending under control before economic fears began to spread. 
 ''The crimes of the past came back to haunt us, actually,'' said Eva Palocz, general director of the Budapest-based economic research group Kopint-Tarki, pointing to the most recent government projection of a 3.4 percent budget deficit this year. 
 There are no lines of anxious customers at banks here, no runs on supermarkets or other signs that the deep concern expressed by average residents has slid anywhere close to panic. ''What really surprises me is that Hungary is mentioned in the same way as Iceland,'' said Aniko Kesmarky, 53, a customer leaving a bank in downtown Budapest on Friday.
 She and her husband bought a new car over the summer, a Spanish Seat Altea, using a loan denominated in Swiss francs. Ms. Kesmarky said that they have been able to handle increased payments so far, but they had decided to put off a planned renovation in their apartment.
 That kind of spending decision, along with the government's planned cutbacks in public spending and falling demand for the country's exports, led officials here to revise their growth expectations significantly, to 1.2 percent for 2009, from previous projections of 3 percent.
 At Havalda Leather in downtown Budapest, the owner, Viktor Hamori, 44, said that he had not noticed a decline in spending by customers, but that economic turmoil and currency woes were all anyone was talking about.
 Two enormous oil paintings of Mr. Hamori's grandparents look down on the shop full of belts and leashes, a reminder of his family's roots in the business. His forebears owned a flourishing leather factory before the nationalizations under the Communist regime. 
 ''If we survived the last very turbulent century,'' Mr. Hamori said, ''I hope we won't lose everything in the next.''

HEADLINE: How to Quell Financial Anxiety

BYLINE: By PHYLLIS KORKKI. 
E-mail: ccouch@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Q.Day after day of economic turmoil is making it hard for you to concentrate on your work. You can't stop worrying about your job security, your retirement portfolio and your whole future. Is this normal?
 A. It's only natural to feel anxious during a financial crisis. But understand that anxiety can distort reality, disrupt thinking and erode performance -- unless you take steps to manage it.
 ''Our minds are trying to protect us by bringing up things we should worry about,'' said Margaret Wehrenberg, a clinical psychologist in Naperville, Ill., and co-author of ''The Anxious Brain.'' Too easily, though, these negative thoughts can crowd out all others as they replay in an endless loop inside the brain. 
 ''Right now, the whole United States is a little uptight,'' Dr. Wehrenberg said. But the feeling is worse for people ''who tend to ruminate a lot anyway and have a hard time turning off those worried thoughts,'' she said.
 Psychologists distinguish between fear, which has a specific cause, and anxiety, which may not. ''One of the things that makes anxiety so debilitating is that you can't entirely put your finger on it,'' said Sigal G. Barsade, associate management professor at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania and an expert on group psychology. 
 Q. How can anxiety affect people's work?
 A. Anxiety creates cognitive distortion and can make it harder for people to concentrate and to process information, said Myra S. White, a clinical instructor at Harvard Medical School who focuses on workplace performance. Their decision-making is impaired, and they are more likely to make mistakes, she said. Because they can't listen as well, they may need to have instructions repeated to them several times. They may also have shorter fuses and become more impatient.
 ''Anxiety is living in the past or the future; it's not living in the moment,'' Dr. Wehrenberg said, so the work in front of you is bound to suffer. 
 Q.Can your co-workers have an effect on your anxiety level?
 A. It is very easy to ''catch'' anxiety through a process known as emotional contagion, Professor Barsade said. Densely populated workplaces, she said, are particularly vulnerable to this phenomenon. 
 So if one of your colleagues is moaning that her portfolio has fallen 40 percent and that she will never be able to retire, or another is ranting that your company is sure to go under, be aware that you could ''catch'' their emotions almost as if they were colds.
 ''Stay open to both positive and negative emotion,'' Professor Barsade said. The key to absorbing negative emotions is ''to take them in but not let them take over,'' she said.
 Professor Barsade said anxiety might be worsening the financial crisis. A kind of collective anxiety -- in part emerging in the workplace -- could cause people to take overly drastic actions with their money, which could hurt the economy, she said. 
 Managers need to be aware that their employees are feeling anxious now, Professor Barsade said. They should let employees express their anxiety -- and should discuss and clarify the company's situation honestly.
 Q.Are there physical aspects to anxiety?
 A. ''Anxiety can wreak havoc on the body,'' said Dr. White, who has a doctorate in psychology. Physical symptoms, she said, can include a pounding heart, sweaty hands, headaches and indigestion. Anxious people tend to hold their breath and take shallow breaths, she said, so work on taking deep breaths, especially when you exhale.
 Yoga, meditation, exercising or simply taking a walk can help dispel symptoms, Dr. White said.
 ''Any time you're really stuck in your mind, moving your body helps shift it,'' Dr. Wehrenberg said.
 Q.What else can you do to tame anxiety? 
 A. Ms. Wehrenberg recommends this strategy: worry once and do it well.
 In other words, if you're going to fret, be systematic about it and get it over with. If you're concerned about your finances, for example, meet with a financial planner and decide what steps to take to protect assets as best you can. If you're worried about losing a job, update your resume and lay all the other initial groundwork for a job search. Then focus on the job you still have; that is something you can control, as opposed to some horrific future scenario that may never occur. 
 If you start to feel anxious about your job or your finances, remind yourself that you have a plan and that you have done everything you can do at this time, Dr. Wehrenberg said. Say to yourself, ''Stop, I already worried,'' then pull yourself back to your work, she said. 
 ''Think about what you've got in the now. Today you're O.K.,'' she said. ''Focus on what you have instead of what you don't have.''
 She says she has patients who feel that they aren't allowed to enjoy themselves because of the economy. ''It's not going to ruin your portfolio if you play or go out with friends,'' she said.
 But if you feel overwhelmed by anxiety to the point that you can't finish your tasks or are having destructive thoughts or abusing drugs or alcohol, you should seek professional help, she said.

HEADLINE: Small Banks Stay Snug, Like the Fabled Ant

BYLINE: By KEVIN COYNE. 
E-mail: jersey@nytimes.com

DATELINE: Oradell 

 BODY:
 THE president's office at Freedom Bank occupies a small corner of the lobby, and through its glass walls Paul Fitzgerald could see the wide-screen television mounted near the main entrance. The news from the other side of the Hudson was screamingly bad. The end of the world was nigh, again, as Wall Street staggered toward the close of its worst week ever. Mr. Fitzgerald barely looked up.
 ''What's it down now, 305?'' he asked, sitting at a desk from which he could see all his customers, and they could see him. The big numbers on the TV screen mattered far less to the health of his bank than the smaller numbers on his desk: the new deposits being recorded, the loans being made. ''You've got to stick to the basics,'' he said. ''If we've learned anything from current events it's that if you ignore the basics, eventually you're going to get in trouble.'' 
 Plenty of New Jerseyans have been upended by that trouble, from the investment captains of Summit to the junior analysts of Hoboken to the retirees of Toms River who wince as they peek at their 401(k)'s. But from inside the small banks and credit unions that anchor the state's downtowns -- like Freedom Bank, which just opened in April in a tidy brick building overlooking the Oradell Reservoir -- the view is more placid, and shaded by a hint of I-told-you-so. 
 ''I think Main Street banking is going to be back in vogue, and I think a lot of people would use the Jimmy Stewart analogy,'' said Mr. Fitzgerald, 59, who has worked for New Jersey banks both large and small throughout his career, and who shares an alma mater (Princeton) with America's favorite small-town movie banker. ''Maybe that's an omen.''
 While national banks gorged on one another in recent years, growing ever larger and devising ever more exotic theories about how and to whom to lend money, smaller, state-chartered institutions watched skeptically from the sidelines, unconvinced that the basic laws of economics had suddenly changed, and husbanding assets that amounted to no more than loose change at their swaggering competitors. A wise strategy, as it turned out. Staying small and staying home has meant staying solvent.
 ''You stuck to your knitting when you had to and maybe it cost you some bottom-line points, but in the end you're going to be there to take advantage of the present circumstances,'' said Steven M. Goldman, the commissioner of the state's Department of Banking and Insurance. State-chartered institutions like Freedom Bank, he said, ''are almost without exception in pretty good shape. None of them participated in any of this subprime lending that has caused so much difficulty.''
 And so -- while Wall Street was sinking on the TV screen, while big companies were wondering whether big banks would lend them any money, while Washington was lurching toward a bailout -- Paul Fitzgerald, like other small bankers in New Jersey, had other matters to attend to: the daily business of keeping a local economy lubricated. Credit might have frozen in the national economy, but it was still flowing here on Kinderkamack Road. The owner of an apartment building was refinancing to make renovations. A small-business owner brought in his financial statements, looking for a line of credit. Depositors stashed cash in money market accounts whose rate of return (3.4 percent) was looking more generous by the hour compared with the investment options on Wall Street.
 Michael Giancarlo came to Freedom Bank because his business -- Atrium Pharmacy of Emerson, which fills and packages prescriptions for nursing homes, group homes and assisted-living facilities -- needed a substantial credit line to bridge the gap between when it has to pay for medications and when it is reimbursed by insurance companies. ''If we needed an extra $100,000 we had to go through their home office and it would take weeks and weeks to come back, so we went searching for another bank,'' said Mr. Giancarlo, 46, co-owner with his brother of Atrium, which is 10 years old, with 18 employees and $6 million in annual sales. They switched from Washington Mutual to Freedom three months ago. ''We explained it all, and they could tell we knew what we were doing.''
 The same shift is under way at other community banks. ''They're playing an even bigger role as some of the larger banks have become paralyzed,'' said Michael Horn, a former state banking commissioner and state treasurer, and the chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, a government-chartered cooperative that has lent 40 percent more over the last year to the community banks it serves. ''People still want the feeling that they know the bank president, and the president knows them.''
 For six months last year, before Freedom Bank opened, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had helped start two other community banks in recent years, was the lone employee, working by himself in the 5,000-square-foot building that had for many years been home to a branch of Provident Bank. Freedom started with 16 investors -- local professionals and business owners -- who each put up $100,000. About 250 other shareholders invested also, and the bank opened with $13 million in capital. At the end of September, its deposits had grown to $50 million. Since April, four other new community banks have also opened in the state.
 ''I've seen what happens when the local touch goes away,'' Mr. Fitzgerald said, as the TV screen beyond his glass wall showed the dire consequences on a national scale. ''These people who took risks and either brought down or caused severe damage to their institutions and their shareholders and their employees get a get-out-of-jail-free card. It doesn't quite pass the smell test.''
 The bank is open each business day until 6, and after the stock market had closed, and the day's damage was tallied up elsewhere, the lobby TV was tuned to a more festive contest: the playoff game between the Phillies and the Dodgers. ''I think people are a little tired of seeing all the red ink,'' Mr. Fitzgerald said. ''It's a nice change of pace.''

 The economy is in a shambles. The United States is mired in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Perhaps it's no wonder that a record-high 89 percent of Americans say things have ''pretty seriously gotten off on the wrong track,'' according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll.
 But what about that 7 percent of Americans who say they think the United States is moving in the right direction? Why are they optimistic? 
 Well, many of them are in another distinct minority: the 24 percent of Americans who approve of President Bush's job performance. They also are generally among the 49 percent who believe things are going well for the United States in Iraq, according to the nationwide telephone poll of 1,070 adults conducted Oct. 10-13.
 Michael Orsi, 65, a retired railroad clerk from Niagara Falls, N.Y., is among those who say the country is moving in the right direction. He also says the president is being unfairly blamed for the state of the nation. ''If I have any hard feelings about things in this country, it's about the Congress,'' he said in an interview after the poll was completed.
 He explained further: ''In my little world, my earnings are keeping up with my expenses. I saved when I was working and paid for my home and my cars. Financially, I'm pretty stable. I've got a pension coming in. The economy is good as far as I can see it.''
 But for Mr. Orsi, his answer is also a matter of perspective. ''I live in Niagara Falls,'' he noted, ''and its been going down for 30 years.''
 The number of people who think the nation is headed in the wrong direction crossed the 50 percent mark in early 2003 and has been trending upward since. As confidence in the economy began to drop, so did optimism about the nation's direction.
 The poll found that most Americans are feeling decidedly gloomy about the economy and expect it to deteriorate further. But like many of the respondents with an upbeat view, Melva DeVries, 73, a homemaker from Gobles, Mich., disagreed.
 ''I guess I'm an optimist and I don't feel like our country is just going to go down the tubes,'' Mrs. DeVries said.
 Laura Cichowski, 51, a homemaker from Denison, Tex., and another optimist, suggested that Americans needed to take the long view on the economy. 
 ''When a lot of focus is on an immediate concern, such as the economy, people tend to see what is right in front of them instead of the overall picture,'' she said. ''I really think this is a blip on the radar and hopefully if you have enough time for your investments to come back, they will and I have confidence that will happen. And in general I feel we're doing well in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan if we stay the course.''
 Brian Lockrey, 41, an Internet marketer from Midland, Mich., offered a similar view.
 ''I believe the country is going in the right direction for several reasons,'' he said. ''We're making some headway in Iraq, despite what the media says. And as far as the economy goes, I know jobs are being outsourced but there are other things here happening in the United States that are not being seen. I see a lot of people making a lot of money online.''
 Larry Nix, 57, an electrical contractor from Toccoa, Ga., who has owned his own business for 15 years, also says he feels good about the country's direction. He said that he and his wife, Judy, ''have been very conservative with our money and we use wisdom; we have saved.'' 
 He blamed the media for putting a negative spin on things. ''I do not think everything was bad,'' he said. ''I believe the media put more of a tailspin than it should have.''
 Others were more equivocal. Gayle Brooks, 64, a retired college dean who lives in Brooksville, Fla., took issue with the question. ''I said right direction because I was given only the options of 'going in the right direction or on the wrong track' but I needed something in the middle.''
 So how does she really feel?
 ''Things are as good as can be expected these days,'' she said.

HEADLINE: F.B.I. STRUGGLING TO HANDLE WAVE OF FINANCE CASES

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU, DAVID JOHNSTON and RON NIXON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Bureau of Investigation is struggling to find enough agents and resources to investigate criminal wrongdoing tied to the country's economic crisis, according to current and former bureau officials.
 The bureau slashed its criminal investigative work force to expand its national security role after the Sept. 11 attacks, shifting more than 1,800 agents, or nearly one-third of all agents in criminal programs, to terrorism and intelligence duties. Current and former officials say the cutbacks have left the bureau seriously exposed in investigating areas like white-collar crime, which has taken on urgent importance in recent weeks because of the nation's economic woes.
 The pressure on the F.B.I. has recently increased with the disclosure of criminal investigations into some of the largest players in the financial collapse, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The F.B.I. is planning to double the number of agents working financial crimes by reassigning several hundred agents amid a mood of national alarm. But some people inside and out of the Justice Department wonder where the agents will come from and whether they will be enough. 
 So depleted are the ranks of the F.B.I.'s white-collar investigators that executives in the private sector say they have had difficulty attracting the bureau's attention in cases involving possible frauds of millions of dollars. 
 Since 2004, F.B.I. officials have warned that mortgage fraud posed a looming threat, and the bureau has repeatedly asked the Bush administration for more money to replenish the ranks of agents handling nonterrorism investigations, according to records and interviews. But each year, the requests have been denied, with no new agents approved for financial crimes, as policy makers focused on counterterrorism.
 According to previously undisclosed internal F.B.I. data, the cutbacks have been particularly severe in staffing for investigations into white-collar crimes like mortgage fraud, with a loss of 625 agents, or 36 percent of its 2001 levels.
 Over all, the number of criminal cases that the F.B.I. has brought to federal prosecutors -- including a wide range of crimes like drug trafficking and violent crime -- dropped 26 percent in the last seven years, going from 11,029 cases to 8,187, Justice Department data showed.
 ''Clearly, we have felt the effects of moving resources from criminal investigations to national security,'' said John Miller, an assistant director at the F.B.I. ''In white-collar crime, while we initiated fewer cases over all, we targeted the areas where we could have the biggest impact. We focused on multimillion-dollar corporate fraud, where we could make arrests but also recover money for the fraud victims.''
 But Justice Department data, which include cases from other agencies, like the Secret Service and Postal Service, illustrate the impact. Prosecutions of frauds against financial institutions dropped 48 percent from 2000 to 2007, insurance fraud cases plummeted 75 percent, and securities fraud cases dropped 17 percent. 
 Statistics from a research group at Syracuse University, the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, using somewhat different methodology and looking only at the F.B.I., show an even steeper decline of nearly 50 percent in overall white-collar crime prosecutions in the same period.
 In addition to the investigations into Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the F.B.I. is carrying out investigations of American International Group and Lehman Brothers, and it has opened more than 1,500 other mortgage-related investigations. Some F.B.I. officials worry privately that the trillion-dollar federal bailout of the financial industry may itself become a problem because it contains inadequate controls to deter fraud. 
 No one has suggested that a quicker response would have averted the mortgage meltdown, but some officials said a faster reaction might have deterred more of the early schemes that seized on loose federal lending regulations. 
 ''They were very late to the game,'' Representative Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat who has quarreled with the F.B.I. over its financing priorities, said of the bureau's response to the mortgage crisis. ''They were not on top of this, and they're just now starting to really do something.''
 Republicans and Democrats in Congress are pushing for a more aggressive response by the F.B.I. Representatives Mark S. Kirk, an Illinois Republican who sits on the House appropriations committee, and Chris P. Carney, a Pennsylvania Democrat, called on Congress to triple the F.B.I.'s financing for financial crimes investigations. 
 ''To fix our system and prevent a repeat of the events we now see,'' they wrote in a letter this month to Robert S. Mueller III, the F.B.I. director, ''we have got to set an example by bringing the full might of federal law enforcement against the people who illegally profited or destroyed companies at the expense of our country.''
 In public, Mr. Mueller has said that the bureau is doing more with less, when it comes to criminal prosecutions. And Justice Department officials have repeatedly asserted the administration's commitment to fight violent and white-collar crime even as they have not provided the bureau additional resources. 
 But current and former officials say Mr. Mueller has lost a behind-the-scenes battle with the Justice Department and the Office of Management and Budget to replenish the criminal ranks.
 Interviews and internal records show that F.B.I. officials realized the growing danger posed by financial fraud in the housing market beginning in 2003 and 2004 but were rebuffed by the Justice Department and the budget office in their efforts to acquire more resources.
 ''The administration's top priority since the 9/11 attacks has been counterterrorism,'' Peter Carr, a Justice Department spokesman, said. ''In part, that's reflected by a significant investment of resources at the F.B.I. to answer the call from Congress and the American public to become a domestic intelligence agency in addition to a law enforcement agency.''
 From 2001 to 2007, the F.B.I. sought an increase of more than 1,100 agents for criminal investigations apart from national security. Instead, it suffered a decrease of 132 agents, according to internal F.B.I. figures obtained by The New York Times. During these years, the bureau asked for an increase of $800 million, but received only $50 million more. In the 2007 budget cycle, the F.B.I. obtained money for a total of one new agent for criminal investigations.
 In 2004, one senior F.B.I. official, Chris Swecker, warned publicly that a flood of fraudulent mortgage deals had the potential to become ''an epidemic.'' Yet the next year, as public warnings about fraud in the subprime lending markets began to approach their height, the F.B.I. had the equivalent of only 15 full-time agents devoted to mortgage fraud out of a total of some 13,000 agents in the bureau.
 That number has grown to 177 agents, who have opened 1,522 cases. But the staffing level is still hundreds of agents below the levels seen in the 1980s during the savings and loan crisis.
 F.B.I. officials said they had had no choice but to make the cuts in the criminal division, which they said were necessary to expand the bureau's national security effort, particularly in the wake of criticism of the bureau's performance in failing to detect the Sept. 11 plot.
 In white-collar crime, they said the bureau has given up only lower-level cases of marginal significance that might have never been prosecuted anyway. They say they have focused the available criminal resources on public corruption and other difficult crime issues in which the F.B.I. can make a unique contribution. 
 ''We only had a finite number of white-collar crime agents available to address the threat that mortgage fraud posed,'' said Joseph Ford, who retired from the F.B.I. this year and once served as its chief financial officer.
 The Justice Department is relying more than ever on the state and local authorities to pick up the slack through joint task forces. And private investigators say that companies victimized by fraud are turning to them in increasing numbers because they are unable to attract much attention from the F.B.I. anymore.
 In some instances, private investigative and accounting firms are now collecting evidence, taking witness statements and even testifying before grand juries, in effect preparing courtroom-ready prosecutions they can take to the F.B.I. or local authorities.
 ''Anytime you bring to the F.B.I. a case that is thoroughly investigated and reduce the amount of work for investigators, the likelihood is that they will take the case and present it for prosecution,'' said Alton Sizemore, a former F.B.I. agent who is a fraud examiner for Forensic Strategic Solutions in Birmingham, Ala. 
 One American company facing extortion demands last year from a computer hacker used private investigators from the Kroll firm to do much of the legwork in the case as the F.B.I. monitored and directed the situation behind the scenes, said Daniel Karson, executive managing director for Kroll. The private investigators even went undercover and set up a sting operation that led them to Germany, where the authorities made an arrest. 
 Mr. Karson said the F.B.I. no longer had the resources to take on such lower-level cases by itself. ''When you come in with a garden variety, plain vanilla crime, you may have to stand in the queue,'' he said.
 Some critics question whether the shift indicates not just a lack of resources, but a lack of interest by the Bush administration.
 After the collapse of Enron in 2002, the Justice Department moved aggressively against corporate fraud -- too aggressively, in the view of some people within the administration. It set up a national task force to tackle the problem, garnered hundreds of convictions at companies like WorldCom, Adelphia and Enron, and forced the closure of Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm, for its role in the Enron collapse.
 But several former law enforcement officials said in interviews that senior administration officials, particularly at the White House and the Treasury Department, had made clear to them that they were concerned the Justice Department and the F.B.I. were taking an antibusiness attitude that could chill corporate risk taking. 
 Justice Department officials said political pressures had never influenced the way prosecutors approached corporate cases. But the department's approach has become noticeably more tempered in the last several years.
 This spring and summer, as public concerns about the subprime mortgage crisis were growing, Attorney General Michael B. Mukasey rejected repeated calls for the creation of a national task force like the one used after the Enron collapse. The attorney general likened the problem to ''white-collar street-crime'' that could best be handled by individual United States attorneys' offices.
 In the last four years, the Justice Department has scored fewer of the big-name prosecutions that marked President Bush's first term in office. Even when investigations have pointed to corporate wrongdoing, the Justice Department has agreed, in dozens of cases in the last four years, to ''deferred prosecutions'' that allowed companies to pay fines in order to avoid criminal prosecution.
 Paul J. McNulty, who served as deputy attorney general under Alberto R. Gonzales, said the complexity of white-collar investigations and the shortage of investigators had driven a decline in high-profile cases.
 ''There's no question that the department has been stretched thin when it comes to resources generally, and that has affected white-collar enforcement in a variety of areas,'' Mr. McNulty said in an interview. 
 ''What happened is that the first years after the Enron collapse, there were some very high profile, noticeable cases -- the low-hanging fruit -- that gave Justice the opportunity to rack up some very big wins,'' he said. ''Those cases played themselves out and it became tougher to find those big cases.''

HEADLINE: Down and Out, With a Typewriter

BYLINE: By HARRY HURT III

 BODY:
ONCE, Richard LeMieux was the envy of all his friends. He owned a publishing firm in Washington State that produced medical and university directories. He also owned a beachfront house, three boats and assorted luxury cars.
 But the rise of the Internet contributed to his downfall, and in 2002, Mr. LeMieux's business failed. In short order, he lost almost everything he had held dear. He became estranged from family members. The bank foreclosed on his house and evicted him. At 59, he was left with his clothes, his Oldsmobile van and a little white pooch he called Willow the Wonder Dog. 
 For 18 months, Mr. LeMieux was homeless. In what can be seen as a cautionary tale for our time, he recounts his descent in ''Breakfast at Sally's: One Homeless Man's Inspirational Story'' (Skyhorse Publishing, $24.95). 
 Mr. LeMieux slept in his van in church parking lots in Bremerton, Wash. He hung out at the local Salvation Army, which he and other homeless people affectionately called ''Sally's.'' He started writing his book on a discarded manual typewriter. 
 The pastor of the First United Methodist Church ultimately allowed Mr. LeMieux and Willow to live in the church kitchen for nine months, where they served as ''security guards.'' The congregation then helped him move into an apartment, where he finished his book.
 In the introduction Mr. LeMieux says that ''about 98 percent'' of the events and stories recounted in the book are factual. He acknowledges changing some names to ''protect the innocent,'' and altering certain time frames to ''make the story more accessible.''
 The book reads like a novel, with the narrative moving in scene-by-scene sequences replete with lengthy dialogue between the author and people he meets. But it has the ring of truth, and an uplifting message that endures on its intrinsic merits.
 Mr. LeMieux's account of his homelessness is convincing because it is neither overwrought nor sensationalist. On Thanksgiving Day 2002, he found himself begging for money in front of a grocery store where he estimated he had spent $192,000 during the preceding 20 years. Most of the store's patrons ignore or disdain his pleas for help. One of them calls him ''a bum.'' A security guard orders him to move on. But as he is leaving the store parking lot, an elderly woman in a red coat gives him $64.50 -- and a renewed faith in humanity.
 Mr. LeMieux goes on to describe scavenging through garbage bins in search of discarded clothes, appliances, and partially smoked cigarettes. He introduces us to a menagerie of colorful characters like ''C,'' a pot-smoking asphalt angel who quotes Jean-Paul Sartre, Joseph Campbell and Franz Kafka; Andy, an alcoholic former logger who gets himself arrested by the local police 44 times in a year so he can spend the corresponding nights drying out in a hospital ward; and Karen -- like him, once accustomed to owning nice things -- who commits suicide by jumping off a bridge shortly after arriving at the Salvation Army.
 Mr. LeMieux also recounts his personal emotional battles, including a suicide attempt he aborted when he heard Willow barking from inside his van. In March 2003, he received a diagnosis of ''clinical depression,'' and was subsequently given a prescription for Zoloft. 
 Mr. LeMieux appears to have difficulty recalling many salient details of his past life. He summarizes his past in a series of flashbacks interspersed throughout his narrative. And he is annoyingly sketchy in accounting for the collapse of his business and the details of his family life. (At the end, he does describe scenes of reconciliation with his children.) He says his memory losses are byproducts of his depression, which makes his plight only more poignant. 
 In the chronicle, Mr. LeMieux, once a Republican fund-raiser, becomes a born-again Democrat and an authoritative advocate for the millions of Americans who are homeless or living in poverty. But what makes his book so compelling is his nonpartisan reportage.
 Mr. LeMieux's profiles of his homeless peers debunk frivolous stereotypes and illuminate a sobering reality that may become increasingly common in America. His anecdotal evidence suggests that homelessness is often caused by economic, social and emotional catastrophes beyond any individual's control. 
 Given the state of the economy and the likelihood of continuing repercussions, his book is timely. He duly reminds us of John Steinbeck's observation in another book about the down and out, ''The Grapes of Wrath:'' ''If you're in trouble or hurt or need -- go to the poor people. They're the only ones that'll help -- the only ones.''

HEADLINE: Monastic Doors Open for Travelers

BYLINE: By JANE MARGOLIES

 BODY:
WHEN Kathleen Mazzocco was researching places for an affordable family vacation in Italy back in 2002, booking a room in a convent was ''like shooting in the dark,'' she recently recalled. 
 The guidebook to religious lodgings that Ms. Mazzocco used had no photographs, and she wasn't sure the information was up-to-date. After mailing money orders to convents in Rome and Florence, she received no response. ''I was on pins and needles,'' she said. ''I had no idea if they had our reservations.''
 But by the time Ms. Mazzocco, a public relations consultant from Lake Oswego, Ore., returned to Italy last year, making a reservation at a monastery was not so different from booking a regular hotel. She found the cliffside Monastero S. Croce, in Liguria, on the Internet, viewed photos of it on the monastery's own Web site, sent an e-mail message asking about availability, heard back promptly, and, at the end of her stay, paid with a credit card. ''They'd entered the modern age,'' she said. 
 For centuries Europe's convents and monasteries have quietly provided inexpensive lodging to itinerants and in-the-know travelers, but now they're increasingly throwing open their iron-bound doors to overnight visitors. They've begun Web sites -- many with English translations and detailed information about sampling monastic life for a night -- and signed on with Internet booking services. Some have even added spa offerings. Occupancy has shot up at many places, and some of the more centrally located are often fully booked. 
 And while some of the people staying at such holy spots are among the 300,000 religious travelers fueling the booming $18 billion faith-tourism industry, others are simply ordinary vacationers seeking a more authentic alternative to an anonymous hotel. 
 ''Twenty years ago, nobody was going to monasteries unless they were into religious tourism,'' said Andrea Moretti, a travel consultant at the Italian Government Tourist Board, who estimates that between 1 and 5 percent of Italy's 93 million annual visitors stay in religious lodgings, with Americans particularly attracted to them. ''Now even if they're not interested in religion, people consider a monastery because they like the pace and feeling.''
 Not to mention the price. While peaceful interior courtyards and the chance to hear nuns singing Vespers are certainly part of the allure, religious lodgings are almost always cheaper than hotels -- often considerably cheaper. And with the dollar remaining weak, more and more travelers are looking at convents and monasteries as a way to beat the euro. So what if they don't have mini bars and room service? 
 ''We spent less than half what we would have in a comparable hotel,'' said Marilyn Henderson, a retired accountant from Lakewood, Wash., of the Opera della Divina Provvidenza, in Venice, where she and her husband stayed in July. The Hendersons paid 136 euros a night ($189 at $1.39 to the euro) for a double room with a private bath in the church-owned guesthouse, which has ceiling frescoes by Tintoretto and Tiepolo and is a 15-minute walk from San Marco. ''It was easily equivalent to a three-star accommodation,'' she said.
 More spartan convents and monasteries, or places in less central spots, can cost less than hostels. ''You CAN Afford Europe This Year!'' shouted the headline of a recent article on the Web site Slowtrav.com, which cites convents and monasteries as ''a great value.'' 
 And if it's disconcerting to think of men and women of the cloth chasing after tourist dollars, for some orders it's a matter of economic survival, according to the Association of Superiors of German Orders, whose German-language site, www.orden.de, lists 311 cloisters in Germany that offer room and board (and, in some cases, housemade beer and marzipan). ''The income from overnight guests is a necessity,'' Arnulf Salmen, a spokesman for the organization, wrote in an e-mail message. 
 The tradition of religious houses offering lodging dates back to the sixth-century Rule of St. Benedict, the document laying out the ways of monastic life, which includes a chapter on extending hospitality. Over the ages monasteries have sheltered individual travelers and those seeking solace, as well as church groups on organized retreats.
 But in recent decades, as farming and other sources of income have fallen off, religious orders have embraced the role of innkeeper.
 The Bridgettine Sisters -- named for the 14th-century St. Bridget of Sweden -- operate guesthouses in 11 European countries (Italy, Britain, Sweden, Poland, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Estonia, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Norway), not to mention Mexico and India and in Darien, Conn. (A full list can be found at www.brigidine.org.) At Casa di Santa Brigida, in Rome, on lovely Piazza Farnese, prettily decorated rooms off marble halls have private baths, plus needle-pointed Madonnas over the single beds, and there's a common room with a flat-screen TV and a roof terrace. In between prayers, the nuns, whose black habits are topped by little crowns of crossed white bands, cheerfully issue room keys at the front desk and wait on tables at breakfast. 
 Other religious communities operate in a more informal way, offering only two or three guest rooms and relying on donations rather than a set daily rate. ''They might give you an envelope and ask you to put in it whatever you'd like,'' said Kevin J. Wright, author of ''Europe's Monastery and Convent Guesthouses,'' which is geared to the Christian traveler. 
 Certain restrictions may apply. Although religious houses generally welcome visitors of all faiths, some monasteries allow only men on the premises (Monasterio de Santo Domingo de Silos in Burgos, Spain; 35 euros)), and some convents only women (Monasterio de San Benito, in Navarra; 30 euros including meals). 
 Some enforce curfews or have daytime lockouts so that the sisters can make the beds. Silence may be required after a certain hour.
 And although abbeys that allow visitors to sleep inside their walls might expect guests to fall in with prayers four times a day, the more tourist-oriented facilities let guests come and go as they please. None of the travelers interviewed for this story reported any pressure to attend Mass, let alone convert, though some were expected to bow their heads before meals.
 ''Normally we wouldn't say a prayer before eating, but that's just part of the deal,'' said Ruth Lake, a Milan-based American corporate-communications consultant who stayed at Monastero S. Croce with her daughter last summer. 
 For those who bristle at rules, or crucifixes on prominent display, there are hotels occupying deconsecrated religious quarters -- guests can have their Gothic arches and 400-thread-count linens, too. At the Hotel Monasterium Poortackere in Ghent, Belgium, housed in a convent that the church sold in 1998, guests can choose between three-star hotel rooms starting at 115 euros a night or convent cells (no phone or TV, use of communal showers and a bathroom down the hall) from 46 euros. 
 Among the 300 formerly religious properties represented on the ZefiroWorld Tour Operator Web site, www.go-to-Italy.com, there are small luxury hotels in former convents, and fabulously appointed villas once owned by the nobility and given to the church ''so the owners could get into paradise,'' said Claudia Sardo Bollweg, a partner in the agency. 
 But for Mary-Rose Leversedge, a freelance copy editor from Christchurch, New Zealand, such dolled-up places are not authentic. On a five-month tour of France and Spain ending in March, she stayed at three convents including Notre-Dame-de-l'Abbaye in Carcassonne, France, where her room was plain but had gorgeous old French shutters. ''It was not materially rich, but it was historically rich,'' said Ms. Leversedge, who is a convert to convents when traveling solo. ''I had not gone to France 'on the prowl,' so it was great to feel safe and not have to worry that anyone would bother me.''
 For years, it was specialized guidebooks that led people to such places. One of the first was ''Bed and Blessings Italy: A Guide to Convents and Monasteries Available for Overnight Lodging,'' published in 1999 and now out of print. But the queen of guidebooks on European convent and monastery stays is Eileen Barish, the Santa Barbara, Calif., author of ''Lodging in Italy's Monasteries'' and similar books for Spain and France. Ms. Barish, whose book on Britain's offerings is due out in February, said she visited a third to a half of the places she covers in each of her first three books, which also include information on nearby sites. ''All of them are personally contacted,'' said Ms. Barish, who works with a researcher. In a news release, her publisher, Anacapa Press, calls convents ''the secret of affordable European travel.''
 But with information about many such lodgings now on the Internet, the secret is out. Monasterystays.com, a booking service that began in 2006 with a roster of 100 Italian properties, currently lists 320 and expects to have 400 by the end of the year. The Web site secures reservations for a fee that's included in the room rate. ''We're making a profit,'' said John Clayton, one of the site's partners. In Spain, the travel agency Guia Monasterios offers bookings at 210 religious houses; the agency's Web site (www.guiasmonasterios.com) will provide an English translation starting this fall, said Liz Salcedo, director, through the Tourist Office of Spain.
 But with the opportunity to share their way of life -- and remain solvent -- on the line, many religious communities themselves are making the pitch. 
 The monks at the Orthodox Monastery of New Valamo, in Heinavesi in Finland's eastern lake district, depend on tourism for their livelihood. The monastery, part of the Orthodox Church of Finland, admits 160,000 visitors a year, of which 25,000 stay overnight in its hotel, student rooms and guesthouses (200 beds in all). 
 The Web site (www.valamo.fi) provides, in four different languages, instructions on asking for a blessing (''hold your hands out in front of you, palms upwards, the right hand on top of the left'') and dress (anything ''open or revealing'' is ''not suitable for a monastery''). Overnights at the monastery have steadily increased every year, and in the peak of July, ''we have nights when we are sold out,'' wrote the monastery's marketing manager, Jaana Nykanen, in an e-mail message.
 The Kloster Arenberg, in the German town of Koblenz, had an occupancy of only 35 percent in 2000; after the construction of a new 99-bed guesthouse and Wellness Center with a sauna, fitness studio and spa menu that includes massage and hydrotherapy, it jumped to almost 80 percent last year.
 In a recent survey of the German cloisters that offer overnight accommodations, 90 percent of the respondents indicated that the number of guests in the last five years has been consistently high or increasing, according to Mr. Salmen of the Association of Superiors of German Orders.
 Ellen Singer of Mahwah, N.J., almost didn't get a room at a convent for a trip that she'll be taking to Rome this month. She contacted every convent listed on the Santa Susanna Web site, www.santasusanna.org, run by the American Catholic Church in Rome. ''They were all sold out,'' Ms. Singer said. Week after week, she filled out the online reservation form for Casa di Santa Francesca Romana a Ponte Rotto -- where she'd stayed in February and liked for its price (80 euros a night) and location (in Trastevere) -- hoping for a cancellation. ''Finally,'' she said, ''I got lucky.''
 Ms. Mazzocco, for one, wonders if the desirability of convents will present a new wrinkle. ''Now that they've gotten so popular,'' she said, ''maybe their prices will go up.''

HEADLINE: Three Trends And a Train Wreck

BYLINE: By TYLER COWEN. 
Tyler Cowen is a professor of economics at George Mason University.

 BODY:
HOW did the world's financial system get into such a mess? It's tempting to blame specific politicians, decisions and laws (or the lack thereof), and leave it at that. 
 While it's certainly true that a great number of serious, identifiable mistakes have been made, we need to broaden our thinking in order to understand what has happened. 
 The crisis is global in nature and its causes are more general and less country-specific than is commonly reflected in the political discourse of any single nation. Many countries -- not just the United States -- came to have fundamentally unsound banking systems. If Japan remains an exception, it is only because it already suffered through similar problems in the 1990s. 
 The current financial crisis comes from a conjunction of three major trends, common to many countries and to a wide variety of financial institutions.
 The first trend was a positive one: an enormous growth in wealth that needed to be moved into investments. Before he became chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben S. Bernanke wrote of a ''global savings glut,'' particularly from Asia. Furthermore, over the last 20 years, many countries have modernized their financial systems and created new channels that linked savings and investment. In Spain, Iceland, Ireland and Britain, the real estate boom was without recent precedent.
 Of course, more wealth is a good thing over all, but the question is whether that wealth has been invested in an effective and prudent way.
 This leads us to the second trend, the greater willingness of both individuals and financial institutions to take on risk. This trend has shown up in many areas, including real estate, derivatives markets, loans to companies like the American International Group, and overpriced equities. Heavy debt, particularly in financial institutions, created a low margin of error for many of these calculations. 
 Greater risk-taking was driven by investor hubris and collective delusion. Banks and other financial institutions bet against the possibility of bad times and in the short run those bets paid off handsomely. But in the long run they were disastrous. 
 For a simple analogy, imagine betting against a sports underdog every year. You may win consistently for a while but eventually you will lose all your money when the odds turn against you. In essence, banks were betting against extreme volatility, which sooner or later does arrive. 
 In the United States, loose monetary policy in the previous decade encouraged this misplaced optimism, while in Europe there was giddiness from the benefits of economic integration. People pursued profits rather than prudence because their minds and emotions were geared to expect further rewards.
 The third component has been weak governance and oversight. That includes inadequate control and monitoring by shareholders, regulators, creditors, accounting systems and ratings agencies, among others. Most people, including informed insiders, simply did not understand the systematic risk that financial institutions were accepting.
 A common view was that a real estate bubble had popped before -- in the late 1980s -- and that the United States had survived that event with a mild recession but not much calamity. Yet, in the meantime, the world had created more fragile interconnections through debt, while most people's expectations about risk had stood still.
 The end result was that both markets and governments failed miserably -- at the same time and on the same issues. With hindsight, it is easy to argue that regulation should have done more, but in most countries, governments were happy about rising real estate and asset prices and didn't seek to slow down those basic trends. (You'll note that greed doesn't play an independent role in this explanation because greed, like gravity, is pretty much always there.)
 Subprime loans collapsed first because those were the investments most dependent on relatively poor borrowers who were the most likely to fail. Since then, we've seen asset values fall throughout the economy. Subprime borrowing was the canary in the coal mine, but it was hardly the only problem. It now seems that a wide range of asset prices were artificially inflated. The market for contemporary art, which depends almost exclusively on very wealthy buyers, will probably be the last market to plummet but that development is almost certainly on its way.
 Over all, then, the three fundamental factors behind the crisis have been new wealth, an added willingness to take risk and a blindness to new forms of systematic risk. All three were needed to bring about the scope of the current mess -- so that means we've had some very bad luck on top of everything else. 
 One prophet of today's crisis was Fischer Black, the late financial economist who developed the Black-Scholes formula for options pricing with the Nobel economics laureate Myron S. Scholes. Mr. Black died more than a decade ago and his work on macroeconomics has not received much attention recently. But in his 1991 book, ''Business Cycles and Equilibrium,'' and his 1995 work, ''Exploring General Equilibrium,'' he argued that major business downturns could be caused by a combination of excess risk-taking and simple bad luck. 
 Most business-cycle analysts have very detailed scenarios for how things go wrong, but Mr. Black's revolutionary idea was simply that we are not as shielded from a sudden dose of bad luck as we might like to think.
 WE'VE already been through a savings and loan crisis, a junk bond crisis and a dot-com bubble, but today's crisis is by far the worst of the lot -- and will probably prove to be more than just a bump in the road. We can do better the next time around, but we have to start by seeing that the current failure is far-reaching and that we can blame many different things and many different people. 
 The real problem is not some particular villain but rather the very fact that we cannot help but put the evaluation of risk into all-too-human hands.

LENGTH: 1305 words

HEADLINE: Sized for the Times

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
HONDA could be forgiven if it resorted to some trash talk right about now. While Detroit -- and even Toyota and Nissan -- went whole hog for big pickups and S.U.V.'s, Honda stuck with its long-term game plan: no Texas-size trucks, no V-8 engines.
 Now the American and Japanese automakers that hitched their stars to big trucks have been humbled. While they're suffering a protracted sales slump, buyers have beaten a path to Honda, lifting the brand's sales this year despite a full-blown recession in the broader auto industry. 
 Cars like the Fit deserve much of the credit. This stubby hatchback arrived to general acclaim in 2006. The Fit defied the image of small economy cars -- honed over decades of flaming Pintos, rusting Renaults and D.O.A. Dodge Omnis -- as cramped, chintzy or unreliable. In contrast, the Fit was roomy and ship-shape, even a little bit sporty. 
 A second-generation Fit steps in for 2009, slightly larger but still barely 13 feet long -- and just 4 inches longer than a Mini Cooper Clubman. Already sold in 115 countries and so popular that Honda dealers can barely keep them in stock, the Fit is all about driving cheaply without feeling cheap.
 From its tight construction and smooth powertrain to upscale options like a voice-activated navigation system, the more refined new Fit gives off a quality vibe that penny-pinching rivals like the Chevrolet Aveo and Toyota Yaris cannot match. 
 I drove the latest Fit around New York and through the Hudson Valley, as part of a press convoy that included the outgoing model, making comparisons easy. Side-by-side parking helped to highlight the Fit's modestly sportier styling, with a more angular nose, a V-shaped bulge in the hood and two enlarged slashes for headlamps.
 The upgraded Fit Sport model adds 16-inch alloy wheels, a front fascia with larger air inlets, rocker panel moldings, a perky spoiler on the hatch and a chrome exhaust tip. (The base model's bargain-basement touches include plastic covers on 15-inch steel wheels). 
 The Fit's thorough safety checklist includes antilock brakes, six air bags and new front head restraints that help to prevent whiplash injuries. A vastly more rigid body structure helps to reduce noise and vibration. That structure is engineered to line up better in collisions with S.U.V.'s and other large vehicles, and the Fit's front end is designed to minimize injuries to pedestrians. Sport models also have electronic stability control, which is not available, unfortunately, on the base model. 
 A larger windshield and front-quarter windows, together with slim front-roof pillars and rear headrests that retract into the seats, give the Fit outstanding visibility. A telescoping steering wheel is a welcome addition. The attractive cloth seats feature bolsters that are surprisingly thick for an economy car. 
 The climate controls are arranged higher on the dash for an easier reach. Once again, the Sport model goes one better with a leather-wrapped steering wheel with illuminated audio and cruise controls; two extra speakers for the 160-watt audio system and a USB port to connect MP3 players. 
 There are also 10 cup holders; don't ask why a car this small needs so many.
 Consumers who've never poked their head into a modern hatchback may be amazed at how much space is packed into the petite body. Two large adults fit quite comfortably in back, thanks in part to reclining second-row seatbacks. Three adults will even fit in a pinch. 
 Honda's so-called Magic Seats dive flat into the floor in a slick one-hand operation, with no need to remove the headrests -- even when the front seats are all the way back. The load floor becomes perfectly flat, unlike those in many rivals, creating a class-leading 57 cubic feet of storage. For comparison, the Ford Escape, a compact S.U.V. that's 13 inches longer, 8 inches taller and 4 inches wider, holds 65 cubic feet.
 Dorm-bound college students will rejoice. Even with passengers in back, the Fit's hatch exceeds the trunk space of nearly every full-size luxury sedan, at least if you stuff it to the roof. And the front passenger seat folds forward to let you carry ladders or other long items.
 The rear hatch opens at a higher angle, making it easier to lean deep inside. There are tie-down hooks, a storage box and a cargo light.
 The new 4-cylinder engine displaces 1.5 liters and turns out 117 horsepower, up 8 from the previous Fit. The Honda takes a modest 9 seconds to reach 60 miles an hour and works hard to climb especially steep hills. But once at cruising speed, the Fit hums along smoothly at 80 m.p.h., and the cabin is notably quieter than it was before.
 The Sport's 5-speed automatic adds a pair of paddle shifters; the transmission isn't the fastest, but a sport setting lets it hold gears right up to the 6,800-r.p.m. red line on the tachometer. Yet it's the 5-speed manual, despite fairly long throws, that coaxes the most fun from the engine. 
 As I headed north from Peekskill on a section of Route 6 that locals call the Goat Trail -- a vertiginous, scenic switchback climb up to the Bear Mountain Bridge across the Hudson -- my back-to-back drives in the new and old Fits were especially telling. 
 The new Fit Sport, with its suspension tweaks and fatter tires, delivered more grip and less body lean when pressed. But the new car's electrically assisted steering, despite having the quickest ratio in its class, felt a bit lifeless compared with the older version.
 While noticeably buzzier and harsher-riding, last year's Fit was more fun to drive, with more of the flingy, devilish attitude that are the hallmarks of a cheap, entertaining hatchback. 
 That said, I always found the Fit's fun-to-drive reputation a bit overstated. Sure, the previous car was agile by the standards of budget subcompacts. But its mileage, practicality and class-leading refinement were what grabbed me, not its performance. And I suspect that for the typical buyer, sharp handling isn't a top priority. 
 The basic automatic-transmission model gets the best economy rating: 28 m.p.g. in town, 35 on the highway. The Sport drops to 27/33 m.p.g. -- a head-scratching deficit for a car with the same engine and transmission ratios, wheels that are only slightly larger and a mere 30 to 40 pounds of extra weight.
 The 2009 Fit is priced roughly $600 more than the '08. The base price is $15,220 with a 5-speed manual transmission. That rises to $17,580 for the better-equipped Sport with an automatic and tops out at $19,430 if you add the navigation system and stability control. 
 Playing catch-up, Ford, General Motors and others are racing to develop more sophisticated subcompacts. But the Detroit contingent won't have their new models here until 2010. For now, only the Nissan Versa and Scion xD are really playing in the same league. 
 While fuel prices are making subcompacts the hottest class of cars the world over, the Fit is not for everyone. The idea that most suburban families are eager to drop two or three sizes to embrace subcompacts -- long associated with drivers who are in school, single-and-struggling or suspiciously frugal -- is wishful thinking. This isn't Europe or Japan, and even when gas hit its recent peak it was selling for less than half what it costs in many countries. 
 But many Americans may consider adding a sprite like the Fit to their family fleet to handle commuting and around-town chores. Honda's research shows some wealthier and better educated buyers migrating to small cars, beyond the usual bargain shoppers.
 In times of economic peril, that receptivity will only grow. Between the usual subcompact buyers and these storm-tossed recruits, Honda should have no problem convincing people that its tiny car is just the right size for the times.

HEADLINE: Suddenly, Europe Looks Pretty Smart

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Paris -- Is Europe no longer an economic museum?
In recent years, as Wall Street boomed, Americans often dismissed Europe as a place for languorous meals and vacations, not economic innovation.
London remained a financial hub, of course, but it was often treated dismissively -- as a flashy aberration pumped up by petrodollars from Russia and the Gulf, an exception to the otherwise somnolent Continent.
That kind of thinking is now under challenge, because during the last 10 days Europeans have proved more nimble than Americans at getting to the root of the global financial crisis, whatever they may have lacked as innovators.
After initially dithering, Europe's leaders came up with a financial bailout plan that has now set the pace for Washington, not the other way around, as had been customary for decades. 
That was clear when the Treasury Department decided to depart from its own initial bailout plan -- the one approved by Congress earlier this month -- and invest up to $250 billion directly in the nation's banks. The nuts and bolts of that approach had been laid out days earlier by European leaders as they tried to save their own financial system.
And that outcome left Gordon Brown, the British prime minister, and Nicolas Sarkozy, the French president, in something of a commanding position to claim the title of wise men. They are now speaking of creating a Bretton Woods agreement for the 21st century, while the leaders of the country that fathered the postwar financial system worked out at Bretton Woods, N.H., prefer to stay away from such big-picture talk.
Mr. Sarkozy, who was to meet this weekend with President Bush at Camp David, told European leaders who gathered in Paris recently that he hoped ''literally to rebuild the foundations of the financial systems.''
C. Fred Bergsten, director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, a centrist economic policy center, summed up the week this way: ''When it came to crisis-response mode, the Europeans, especially the British, did take the lead and the U.S. changed course.''
And the markets seemed to respond accordingly. When stock exchanges around the world bounced back last week from the rout earlier in the month, European shares were big winners. They ended the week up 8.2 percent, compared with a 4.5 percent gain for Wall Street. Many Europeans can't resist crowing. ''European capitalism is better suited to meet the challenges of the current financial crisis,'' Trouw, a Dutch newspaper, declared recently.
In London, where Britain's willingness to follow the United States into Iraq five years ago still evokes outrage, officials have been especially quick to point out they didn't follow Washington's lead this time.
''There's no doubt that it was a British plan that was copied by the U.S.,'' said Leon Brittan, who served as Home Secretary under Margaret Thatcher and was a top official at the European Commission. ''It shows that the American conception of Europe as an economic basket case is outmoded and wrong.''
''Europe showed the capacity to respond to a crisis more quickly than the U.S.,'' he added. ''The U.S. went through agonies to come up with a plan.''
Not everyone was quite so triumphalist in tone, or so confident of generalizing from this one moment. While the course of action that emerged in recent days was smart, it doesn't make up for a long period of denial about Europe's own problems with credit practices before leaders finally recognized that the global financial system was collapsing, said Jean Pisani-Ferry, a former top financial adviser to the French government who is now director of Bruegel, a research center in Brussels. ''For too long, they said the crisis was in the U.S. and wouldn't affect them,'' Mr. Pisani-Ferry added.
Europe, in fact, still has plenty of problems, notably high unemployment and the likelihood of a prolonged recession, as Britain, Ireland, Spain and other countries suffer through a housing bust of their own.
And the fact that France and Germany, Switzerland, Spain and Britain are together anteing up more than $1 trillion to rescue their own financial institutions challenges any assertions that European bankers were any smarter or more prudent than their American counterparts.
So, rather than seeing it as a harbinger of a new dawn, Mr. Pisani-Ferry prefers to view the coordinated move by European leaders last Monday as a welcome departure from their normal glacial approach to policy making.
Whether it was a one-time exception or the first sign of a new pattern, Richard Portes of the Center for Economic Policy Research in London sees a fundamental strength reflected in the European strategy. While Congress and the White House were focused on simply buying up hundreds of billions in mortgage loans gone bad, leaders like Mr. Brown sought to fix a deeper, even more serious threat: a lack of faith in the banks themselves.
That was why their tactic -- becoming the investor of last resort, and the guarantor of loans between banks -- worked to stanch the panic that caused Wall Street to plunge roughly 20 percent in one week.
''The American officials and Congress got so tied up'' with the bad mortgage debt, Mr. Portes said, that ''they didn't see that the key was recapitalizing banks, and re-establishing liquidity in money markets.''
''The Brits and the Europeans saw this first.''
One reason leaders like Mr. Brown might have been more willing to back active government intervention from the beginning is that state ownership of industry has a long history in Britain and on the Continent.
As recently as 1981, Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist president, nationalized the French banking system. And Mrs. Thatcher had to fight tenaciously to push her free-market agenda in the 1980s, cutting back the cradle-to-grave system of benefits introduced after World War II.
Andrew Moravcsik, a professor of politics and international affairs at Princeton, suggests that the experience of following Europe's example, for once, could have domestic political implications for the United States.
''Americans, especially conservatives, have a particular view of Europe as over-regulated, therefore suffering from weak growth and Euro-sclerois,'' Mr. Moravcsik said. ''This could change that view, and create more respect for the European view of regulation more generally.'' It also, he said, might encourage American politicians and voters to take a second look at what used to be called the ''third way'' -- seeking a path that shrinks from dogmatically liberal or conservative views in favor of something pragmatic in the middle.
For the moment, Europe is in sync with the United States, but that may not last, says Mario Monti, the former antitrust chief at the European Commission and longtime proponent of free-market policies. ''A crisis like this can either bring disintegration or further integration,'' he said.
He added that policy makers shouldn't let the acceptance of state ownership of banks pave the way for a broader return of the state-dominated economic model. Already, he said, foes of trade liberalization and other free-market policies in Europe are citing Washington's agreement to dramatically intervene in the American economy as a precedent for advancing their more general argument -- that American-style economics is at a dead end. The United States, he worries, could lose its place as the standard-bearer of traditional, free-market capitalism.
Mr. Bergsten says the true test of Europe's new sense of economic leadership will come in the long term.
''Europe has been a laggard in terms of growth over the last few years,'' he said. ''That's why they're feeling their oats now, because they've been able to trump the U.S. We can give them credit, but we don't know if it's going to lead them to any kind of superior economic performance.''

HEADLINE: Suffolk Angles for Films

BYLINE: By PAT WIEDENKELLER

DATELINE: WESTHAMPTON BEACH 

 BODY:
 STEVE LEVY is standing on top of a pile of boards in the slanting late-day light and looking out over an overgrown field, and he is thinking big. 
 All around him are weeds, scrub and battered outbuildings, but he is conjuring up a vision. It's a 53-acre industrial park of biotech and environmental-technology companies, a hotel, conference center and -- why stop there? -- a film studio, or maybe two or even three, that would lure filmmakers past Manhattan and Queens to a place where movie and TV people have holiday and summer homes anyway. A new junior mecca for New York's film and television industry: Suffolk County.
 ''The producers will see that we have the services and facilities that they need,'' said Mr. Levy, the Suffolk County executive. ''They'll come to us.'' 
 A year ago that might have seemed highly unrealistic: why would any big movie company send its studio work to Suffolk County when New York City is swimming in sound stages, crew and a full-service media industry? 
 But early this year the landscape shifted. Facing tax-break competition from states like Connecticut, New York State tripled its film tax credit to 30 percent, coaxing television and film productions back like hungry pigeons. And in February a veteran television producer reopened a moribund production studio in East Hampton, quickly drawing an HBO pilot with a big-ticket director, Barry Sonnenfeld, because of the tax break and trailing the prospect of more business to come. 
 At the same time, several county initiatives kicked in. Suffolk announced a developer for the Hampton Business and Technology Park at Gabreski Airport here, with a quarter of the site set aside for film production. It introduced incentives, including a $25,000 grant for independent filmmakers who shoot in the county. 
 And Mr. Levy put before the County Legislature a proposal to have the county handle film requests, to spare producers the hassle of getting separate permits from villages and towns (although municipalities may opt out of the arrangement). It would be a first for New York, said Patricia Swinney Kaufman, executive director of the Governor's Office for Motion Picture and Television Development, who said fragmented permit practices in New York have hindered the industry. ''It's going to be a model,'' she said. ''People are going to be watching it.''
 All this, Mr. Levy says, puts his vision well within reach. ''Film and TV production should be one of the mainstays of the economy in Suffolk County,'' he said, bringing all sorts of industry-related jobs but also sending a cascade of business to hotels, restaurants, delis, hardware stores and lumber yards. 
 How much is a matter of debate. Mr. Levy said he had no hard projections, but in New York City the mayor's office estimated that the new tax credit led to an additional $500 million in spending from city-based shoots between April 23 and Sept. 23 compared with that period last year.
 Long Island has been a destination for location shooting since the earliest days of film, and most recently for films like ''Funny Games'' (2007) and television shows like ''The Apprentice.'' 
 But Nassau County gets a lot more of the action, with its Gold Coast estates and proximity to the city. Nassau had 547 film-production days last year to Suffolk's 94, said Lisa Willner, a spokeswoman for the Governor's Office for Motion Picture and Television Development. ''We actually have people fighting over locations,'' said Debra Markowitz, director of Nassau's film commission. ''I can't even say we're trying to attract them because they come anyway.'' 
 Mr. Levy wants their attention. When he took office in 2004, he revived the dormant film commission, appointing a new director and commissioners. His film office director, Michelle Isabelle-Stark, was charged with creating a one-stop Web site and coordinating with municipalities to make shooting in Suffolk easy for filmmakers. ''We'll bend over backward and roll out a red carpet,'' Mr. Levy said. ''It's a clean industry that gets a major infusion into the economy.'' 
 Some things are standing in his way. There is the gantlet of wary villages, towns and local business groups, particularly in magnet locations like the Hamptons with long experience handling film shoots. 
 In East Hampton Village, Larry Cantwell, who as assistant to the mayor issues 25 to 30 film and photography permits a year, is leery of a centralized permit system. ''We want to deal directly with the production companies that are doing the work, we've got 30 years of experience doing this, we have a law that regulates it and we think we do it cooperatively and we do it effectively,'' he said. 
 But Mr. Levy has been chipping away at resistance from town and village leaders, and, he says, most towns and a handful of villages have signed on for a uniform county film application.
 He may have more trouble with skeptics who say the economic advantages to film tax breaks are overstated, depriving states of revenue for a return that is hard to calculate reliably.
 Ms. Swinney Kaufman disagrees. ''We're bursting with film in the city,'' she said, adding that productions lured by the tax credit were already scouting for studio space beyond the boroughs. She called the credit ''a great economic engine for New York,'' generating not just money from film productions but also incubating related industries and skilled jobs -- gaffers, grips, lighting technicians -- for local residents.
 That would be good news to Mitchell Kriegman, a television producer and the writer and creator of the children's programs ''It's a Big Big World,'' ''Bear in the Big Blue House'' and ''Clarissa Explains It All.'' Mr. Kriegman, who owns Wainscott Studios, bought the adjacent East Hampton Studios in December with Michael Wudyka and within months landed a big job: ''Suburban Shootout,'' the HBO pilot directed by Mr. Sonnenfeld with a crew of 125 that was housed and fed locally for two months. He hopes to be a tenant in the new Westhampton Beach complex and said he was already looking at a third location in Suffolk for additional space. 
 He envisions a time when his crews could be called up from the surrounding community, not shipped in from the city, working and keeping the local economy humming even in the off-season. 
 ''It's not 'If you build it they will come,' '' Mr. Kriegman said. ''It's 'They're coming so you better build it before they get here.' ''

HEADLINE: Keeping Lawmakers Happy Through Gifts to Pet Charities

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ and DAVID W. CHEN. 
Kitty Bennett, Brendan Hoffman and Ron Nixon contributed reporting.

 BODY:
They do not seem the most likely classical music patrons: Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics, Boeing and Lockheed Martin.
 But together, these defense contractors are donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to the symphony orchestra in Johnstown, Pa., underwriting performances of Mozart and Wagner in this struggling former steel town. A defense lobbying firm, the PMA Group, even sprang for a Champagne reception at the symphony's opera festival last month.
 Company representatives say they are being generous corporate citizens. But the orchestra is also a beloved charity of Representative John P. Murtha, Democrat of Pennsylvania, whose Congressional committee hands out lucrative defense contracts, and whose wife, Joyce, is a major booster of the symphony.
 ''She just loves knowing that we have an orchestra that is the quality of a larger city orchestra,'' the symphony executive director, Patricia Hofscher, said of Mrs. Murtha. ''Her friends have come here and been impressed by the quality of the orchestra in a geographic and economic region that, let's face it, are not on the beaten path.'' 
 For the first time, corporations and their lobbyists are being required to disclose donations they make to the favorite causes of House and Senate members, and a review of thousands of pages of records shows the extent -- and lavishness -- of this once hidden practice. 
 During the first six months of 2008, lobbyists, corporations and interest groups gave approximately $13 million to charities and nonprofit organizations in honor of more than 200 members of the House and Senate. The donations came from firms with numerous interests before the Congress, such as Wal-Mart, the Ford Motor Company, Kraft Foods and Pfizer, and were received by charities including prominent organizations like the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art, as well as local groups controlled by members of Congress or those close to them. 
 Among the recipients were the Baca Foundation, established by Representative Joe Baca, Democrat of California, to help low-income families in his district; the James E. Clyburn Research and Scholarship Foundation, named for the South Carolina Democrat and majority whip; and the Richard G. Lugar Center for Renewable Energy, founded in honor of the Republican Indiana senator.
 In interviews, donors said they were supporting worthy causes, such as scholarships, research and museums. But several also acknowledged that charitable giving was a way to build good will with lawmakers, whose decisions can have a huge effect on their business.
 In addition, with new restrictions on the access lobbyists have to lawmakers, the practice provides the lobbyists a way to publicly support -- and, sometimes, mingle with -- the members of Congress and their staffs. 
 ''It's a very personal way to curry favor with powerful lawmakers,'' said Keith Ashdown, the chief investigator for Taxpayers for Common Sense, a watchdog group. ''It's also a lobbying tactic that is not completely understood or even known by the public.''
 Several of the defense contractors who contributed to the Johnstown Symphony Orchestra said that they had business ties to Western Pennsylvania and wanted to support community programs there.
 ''Boeing has always had a strong commitment to the endowment of the arts, both in our nation's capital and throughout the country,'' said Douglas J. Kennett, a spokesman for Boeing.
 The disclosure requirement was part of a sweeping ethics rules change adopted by Congress in 2007, after revelations that the House majority leader, Tom DeLay, Republican of Texas, had collected millions of dollars from companies including Exxon and SBC Communications Inc. for his charity for foster children, the DeLay Foundation for Kids, as he ascended the ranks in Congress. Under the law, any time a company or registered lobbyist donates to a charity in honor of a member of Congress, it must be disclosed. There is no limit on how much they can give.
 The practice of such unregulated contributions continues to stir controversy. The House ethics committee is currently investigating whether Representative Charles B. Rangel violated any rules by using Congressional stationery when he solicited some $12 million from corporations and foundations for the Charles B. Rangel Center for Public Service at the City College of New York. Mr. Rangel, a New York Democrat, has said he did not seek funds from anyone with business before his committee and merely encouraged potential donors to meet with City College officials.
 Critics say that the donations not only allow the givers to build connections to lawmakers, they also create another pool of money for incumbent politicians to dole out and raise their standing among constituents. Many of the charities controlled by members of Congress hand out smaller grants to community groups and local projects. In 2005, Representative Joe Barton, a Texas Republican, established the Joe Barton Family Foundation to support charitable organizations within his district, south of the Dallas-Fort Worth area. The foundation employs Amy Barton, the congressman's daughter-in-law, as its executive director.
 Mr. Barton is no ordinary lawmaker. He has served nearly 25 years in the House and remains one of the most influential members of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. 
 The Chicago-based Exelon Corporation, a major nuclear energy company, has emerged as a big donor to his charity. The company gave the foundation $25,000 in June, a month after Mr. Barton introduced a bill that would promote the recycling of used nuclear fuel, which would expand markets for nuclear energy. 
 Exelon has spent years building a relationship with Mr. Barton, and, over the last decade, has contributed about $80,000 to two campaign funds that Mr. Barton controls. 
 The foundation has helped elevate the congressman's profile in the district. He was a featured guest at a groundbreaking ceremony for a Boys and Girls Club in 2006 after his foundation gave nearly $400,000 to the $1.2 million project.
 ''The whole city was there,'' said Sylvia Waters, a director of the Boys and Girls Club of Navarro County. ''We didn't send out invitations. We just made the announcement to the newspapers.''
 A spokesman for Mr. Barton did not respond to phone calls seeking information about the foundation.
 Another legislator, Representative Clyburn, the third most powerful Democrat in the House, has a scholarship fund bearing his name, which took in nearly $90,000 in donations during the first half of 2008, with contributions from energy, pharmaceutical and transportation companies that have business before Congress. 
 Among the donors to the James E. Clyburn Research and Scholarship Foundation is the Nuclear Energy Institute, the trade association representing the nuclear industry, which gave $10,000 during that period, on top of previous donations of about $20,000 in recent years, according to an association spokesman.
 ''Congressman Clyburn has never been shy to say he supports nuclear power,'' said Hannah Simone, senior director of governmental affairs for the institute.
 Roughly two months before the $10,000 donation in June, Mr. Clyburn appeared before a gathering of the nation's energy marketers and said he would urge his colleagues on the Hill to encourage greater use of nuclear power in a bill Congress was considering at the time, according to a published report.
 Kristie Greco, a Clyburn spokeswoman, said that Mr. Clyburn's support of the nuclear power industry is not unusual, given that the industry is to South Carolina what, say, the financial sector on Wall Street is to New York. ''South Carolina is a big nuclear state,'' she said.
 Ms. Greco also said that Mr. Clyburn created the scholarship foundation 20 years ago to provide students with the opportunity to go to college, and he does not solicit donations personally.
 ''As a former public school teacher, Congressman Clyburn saw firsthand that many smart and talented students were not applying for college because they couldn't afford tuition,'' she said. ''The foundation is an independent nonprofit, run by a board which solicits donations and manages the scholarship application process.''
 In Johnstown, the local symphony's reliance on defense contractors for financing was hard to miss on the evening of Sept. 20, as the Murthas greeted guests at the annual Opera Festival, a black-tie affair at the Pasquerilla Performing Arts Center. 
 The event raises about 20 percent of the symphony's annual budget of roughly $650,000. Over the course of the evening, the audience heard pieces by Wagner, Bizet, Verdi, Mozart and Strauss.
 A program for the event paid tribute to the Congressman and Mrs. John P. Murtha Endowment to Benefit the Johnstown Symphony Orchestra. It saluted its platinum sponsors, General Dynamics and Northrop Grumman, which are committed to giving $100,000 each; gold sponsors, Boeing and Lockheed Martin, which are giving $50,000; and a silver sponsor, at $25,000, the PMA Group, a major defense lobbying firm. The donations from the defense industry players are part of multiyear commitments, according to company representatives and Ms. Hofscher. 
 Asked in an e-mail message if Mr. Murtha had any concern that the companies may be giving to the symphony to curry favor with the congressman, his spokesman, Matthew Mazonkey, replied, ''No.''
 Escorting his wife, a tuxedoed Representative Murtha greeted guests as they arrived. Mrs. Murtha has been the honorary chairwoman of the gala for nearly a decade. 
 Mr. Murtha, unlike his wife, is not a fan of opera.
 ''Congressman Murtha comes because he supports Joyce,'' Ms. Hofscher said. ''He just likes different kinds of music.''

HEADLINE: A Real Estate Boom, And Now a Bust

BYLINE: By RUSS BUETTNER

 BODY:
IN another time, Wayne Puff, who had run a small limousine company and twice filed for bankruptcy, might not have won the confidence of major banks or investors with sizable portfolios.
But during the heady days of the real estate boom, some 1,200 investors from across the country poured $123.3 million into his company, New Jersey Affordable Homes. Mr. Puff advertised guaranteed annual returns of 15 to 20 percent from his business buying, renovating and reselling real estate.
Now, more than a decade after he began his real estate investment company, Mr. Puff, 60, of Old Bridge, is being held without bail in the Essex County Jail. Christopher J. Christie, the United States attorney for New Jersey, charged Mr. Puff in June with bilking investors and mortgage lenders through a Ponzi scheme based on mortgage fraud. His company was forced into receivership three years ago, but the mess is still being unwound.
The economic meltdown has focused national attention on Wall Street greed, freewheeling mortgage lenders and lax regulations. All this set the stage for what federal prosecutors say has been a sharp increase in mortgage fraud in neighborhoods across the country. 
In the past year, more than 500 people have been arrested on federal charges related to mortgage fraud, according to the Federal Bureau of Investigation.
Federal prosecutors accused Mr. Puff of employing the usual elements of mortgage fraud: from offices in Woodbridge and Perth Amboy, he worked with a mortgage broker who fudged applications and appraisers who pumped up real estate values. Properties were flipped between insiders at artificially increasing prices.
The scheme cost investors $55 million, saddled banks with $25 million in bad loans and plunged 400 New Jersey properties into legal limbo, according to court records. About half of the homes were in already struggling sections of Newark, Irvington and East Orange in Essex County.
So far, seven people who worked closely with Mr. Puff's company -- two appraisers, four employees and a paralegal for one of his lawyers -- have pleaded guilty on charges related to the scheme.
Some investors are still fighting for their money.
Milija Balabanovic, 82, said he invested a total of $350,000 with Mr. Puff starting in the late 1990s. A former landlord himself, he is once again banging his knuckles under kitchen sinks and mowing yards at two houses he bought with what little money he had left.
''I am not asking anyone to feel sorry for me or anything like that, but I was a self-made millionaire, and now I am a pauper,'' he said. ''Why he was allowed to do business I do not understand.''
Two of his longest-standing friends said they were surprised that Mr. Puff had built such a large enterprise. Lois Keegan said she first met Mr. Puff in the '80s when she was tending bar and he had just moved to New Jersey from Colorado, where he had worked as a ski instructor. She described him as a ''fun'' and ''adventurous'' guy who was the center of a group of 20 friends. She said he worked as a home-repair contractor and came up with a stream of marginal business ideas, including one she partook in called Lady Limousine.
''He had two women drivers, myself and somebody else,'' she said. ''I guess people didn't notice how rickety the limousine was because we were in cute little limousine driving outfits.''
By the early '90s, Mr. Puff was focused on his real estate investment firm, hiring dozens of employees and advertising extensively on radio and in newspapers. He hired as his in-house lawyer George J. Otlowski Jr., whose father was a former mayor of Perth Amboy and a longtime state assemblyman. (Mr. Otlowski has not been charged in the case.) And he arranged to accept money from I.R.A. accounts through Fiserv Trust Company, which administered $46 billion in self-directed retirement and custodial accounts. (Its parent company sold the unit to Ameritrade this year.)
All that suggested credibility in the minds of his investors.
Daniel Kelleher said he began investing with the company in 1995, as he prepared to retire from the Department of Defense. He brought in his brother, Bob, and several friends from a marina in Atlantic Highlands, where he kept a small boat.
Unbeknownst to them, the New Jersey Bureau of Securities raised concerns in 1996 about Mr. Puff's claimed returns and failure to register his securities.
There were some discussions with state and federal regulators but no action was taken against Mr. Puff until three years later.
Meanwhile, Mr. Puff occasionally impressed investors with his fame as a swing dancer. Natalie Gomez, a three-time world swing-dancing champion, took Mr. Puff along for a group appearance on the ''Today'' show on NBC in 1998.
Mr. Kelleher said that Mr. Puff's grace and showmanship on his feet was matched by his facility with banter.
''We used to call him 'Twinkle Toes,' '' Mr. Kelleher said.
In 1999, the New Jersey Bureau of Securities filed a civil complaint in Essex County accusing Mr. Puff of selling unregistered securities. By then, Affordable Homes had 526 active investors who had put in a total of $23.4 million, the complaint said.
In 2002, Mr. Puff signed a consent decree in the case agreeing to stop listing multiple investors on the mortgages for single properties and to offer some investors a chance to pull their money out. His plans typically required investors to leave their money untouched for one to five years.
But most of his investors were not made aware of those actions. Under the agreement, only those eligible to withdraw money had to be notified. In a letter to those investors, Mr. Puff said the company could suffer cash flow problems as a result.
For help, he turned to one of his investors, Herman Gross, of Great Neck on Long Island, who had run a large apparel importing business in the city and owned 50 indoor tennis centers. Mr. Gross put in $2 million to finance the bailout and would eventually invest a total of $11.8 million.
Mr. Gross, 91, said in a court affidavit that he had thought Mr. Puff's ''business model was brilliant'' but that he needed to ''add more professional people.''
In November 2003, Mr. Puff hired Kenneth Lagonia, whom Mr. Puff described to investors as a Wall Street veteran. The next month Mr. Lagonia wrote a letter, which Mr. Puff showed to investors, saying he had received a ''verbal commitment'' for a $60 million bond.
''I am happy to advise you that we have completed our due diligence on Mr. Puff and his firm, and have found them to be honest and trustworthy, with a high degree of integrity,'' Mr. Lagonia added.
Earlier in 2003 a federal judge had released Mr. Lagonia from liability in a civil case the Securities and Exchange Commission had filed in 1998 against him, his partner in two businesses and other associates, charging they had swindled $1.7 million from three investors. A federal judge in Manhattan held that Mr. Lagonia, of Manorville on Long Island, had been involved in some transactions but was not aware of all the details.
The bond never arrived. But with Mr. Gross's cash and with regulators held at bay, Mr. Puff was on his way once again. He moved into new offices in Perth Amboy. He married Kyu Nam Park, a younger woman from Korea.
Some of his investors were catching on. Michael B. Debbs, 73, a boating friend of Mr. Kelleher's who had moved to North Carolina, drove by a property in Aberdeen that was paying him, on paper at least, annual returns of 15 percent. He was startled to see a vacant lot.
''I smelled a rat.'' Mr. Debbs said. ''How can they be paying me all this interest and not doing anything with the property?'' He and Mr. Kelleher said they met with Mr. Puff and Mr. Lagonia, who both tried to reassure them. Mr. Debbs decided to pull out his money, and in June 2004 Mr. Puff agreed to begin paying him $10,000 a month.
Mr. Kelleher stayed in. So did his brother, Bob, who had invested about $200,000 that had grown to $500,000 on paper.
''I felt pretty confident,'' said Bob Kelleher, who works in construction in Topeka, Kan. ''The money was secured by mortgages. And as far as I was concerned, I was getting a statement every month from N.J.A.H., as well as Fiserv.''
By April 2005, Mr. Puff still hadn't returned $275,000 to investors who had demanded their money after the 2002 consent decree. New Jersey officials quietly went back to court. Lucy Santiago, Mr. Puff's head of investor relations, stopped taking calls from angry investors, according to court records.
In 2005, nine years after he was first questioned by New Jersey regulators, the S.E.C. filed a civil complaint in federal court in Newark that resulted in the company being shut down and forced into receivership. The S.E.C. named Mr. Puff and later Mr. Lagonia as defendants.
An accounting firm determined that the company had lost $20.5 million from 1999 through 2003 and needed a monthly infusion of $265,000 in new investor money to stay afloat, according to papers filed in bankruptcy court in Newark. About 90 percent of its recent revenue had been generated by flipping the properties between investors and his employees used as straw buyers, according to the court papers.
Prosecutors and regulators accused the company of fraudulently claiming on mortgage applications that investors would live in the properties. Many of the company's 400 properties were in poor condition, according to Charles M. Forman, the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee. One house in Newark -- which Affordable Homes had bought for $18,250 in 2001 and sold to an investor for $212,000 in 2005 -- was deemed worthless and was demolished.
''The largest group of properties are those which are unoccupied and boarded up,'' Mr. Forman said in papers filed in bankruptcy court in Newark.
Seeking clear title to auction off the properties, Mr. Forman filed hundreds of lawsuits against the lenders and investors, many of whom felt victimized a second time.
''All of the sudden we went from investors to defendants,'' Mr. Kelleher said.
Mr. Kelleher, who had been told he had throat cancer, didn't want to fight the trustee while he was fighting for his life. He had taken out $60,000 in interest from his account, but the rest of his $150,000 investment, which his statements showed had grown to $300,000, is gone. His brother, Bob, 62, also didn't fight and put off plans to retire.
Mr. Debbs barely got his money out in time.
Mr. Balabanovic said the trustee offered to allow him to keep the $140,000 in interest he had withdrawn from his Affordable Homes account if he would give up his rights to the properties.
''That's not even-steven, as far as I'm concerned,'' he said. ''All I want is the $350,000 that I originally invested with him.''
At an auction at the Meadowlands sports complex last October, nearly all the properties sold for less than the mortgages Mr. Puff had on them.
It's not clear what will be left for investors. In a lawsuit against Mr. Puff filed in bankruptcy court, Mr. Forman accused Mr. Puff of pulling $5 million from the company during its last four years, often by taking company checks to check-cashing stores. The trustee won a $67.5 million default judgment against Mr. Puff. But all Mr. Puff's known bank accounts have long since been seized.
Mr. Puff's criminal lawyer, Thomas J. Moran of Newark, did not return calls. Court papers this month in the criminal case said plea negotiations were under way.
Mr. Puff faces one count of wire fraud and one count of obstruction of justice, each carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.
His friends said Mr. Puff's wife returned to Korea. Ms. Keegan said she last heard from Mr. Puff more than a year ago, when he called and said he was ''in a lot of trouble'' and unable to disclose his location.
As it was for others who benefited from loose lending during the real estate boom, the party was over.
''When all this happened, we didn't want anything to do with him,'' she said. ''Sorry, Wayne, you're not fun anymore.''

HEADLINE: What Price Oil?

BYLINE: By ROGER LOWENSTEIN. 
Roger Lowenstein, an outside director of the Sequoia Fund, is a contributing writer for the magazine. His most recent book is ''While America Aged: How Pension Debts Ruined General Motors, Stopped the NYC subways, Bankrupted San Diego and Loom as the Next Financial Crisis.''

 BODY:
Back before the mortgage meltdown turned into the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, the country's big economic problem was energy. The presidential campaign was on fire over what to ''do'' about the price of oil. Gas cost more than $4 a gallon, it was slowing down the economy, people were driving fewer miles and they were flying less. Believe it or not, this was an economic crisis that affected people who didn't happen to be pinstriped bankers, hedge-fund managers or cabinet officials. You didn't have to read the stock-market columns to know it was happening. Ordinary people started walking to town or skipping errands -- taking the compact and not the S.U.V. Actually, I did that. And then, the price of oil plummeted, first because of slowing demand and recently amid panic selling during the credit crisis. And as it plunged more than 40 percent from its record high of $147 a barrel, the issue has faded. 
 Well, gas still costs $3.50 a gallon, and the price of a barrel of oil, last week close to $80, still is four times what it was all of six years ago. If that doesn't sound like a big deal, consider that in the half-dozen years of the housing boom, residential home prices rose only 125 percent, whereas oil prices, even now, are 300 percent higher than they were six years ago. So the energy issue is still here. Remember the winter after Katrina, when home-heating-fuel prices caused an uproar? This winter they are likely to be much higher.
 When the new president takes office, high energy costs will be -- as they are already -- a drag on the economy, one that is becoming conflated with the credit crisis. Last month, the U.S. auto industry sold fewer than one million cars -- its slowest sales rate in 15 years. Tight credit and high gas prices each contributed to that. There is no way to completely unravel the two, but here is one fact: In the early part of this decade, when oil was cheap, Americans spent only 2 percent of their income on gasoline. Recently they have been spending about 4.5 percent -- more than twice as much. And you can bet that the percentage is higher among families with lower incomes.
 What we should do about all this varies greatly according to your view of why gas prices went up. Various people who know the oil industry have been worrying for several years that global supplies were running low. Emerging (and populous) nations like China and India have been consuming more, and in many countries and for reasons varying from geology to politics, production was peaking or actually declining. So the supply-demand equation was getting squeezed on both ends. Last winter -- when the price was in the neighborhood of $100 per barrel -- John Hess, the chairman of Hess Corporation, told a conference of energy specialists, ''An oil crisis is coming -- in the next 10 years.'' Just in case the age of oil is truly ending, Hess, a medium-size oil company, is investing in fuel-cell technology, an alternative to gasoline. Richard Rainwater, the Texas investor who made billions buying oil stocks, shares the view that oil is scarce, and so does Warren Buffett, the investor whom Wall Street has been dialing for rescue capital. ''It's supply and demand,'' Buffett told me. ''The ability to produce 10 percent or 12 percent more than the world needed was there, and we got lulled into thinking -- we just kept assuming -- it would always be there. But there isn't any tap to turn on now.'' (Disclosure: I own stock in Buffett's company.)
 Buffett said this during the summer, before high oil prices (and before the full force of the credit hurricane) slowed the world's thirst for oil. Under current conditions, the oil ''tap'' is not so dry, though presumably, economic activity will pick up someday and oil will become scarce again. Of course, this is if you believe that scarcity had anything to do with why the price rose in the first place.
 There is also another, highly publicized view of the oil market. According to skeptics like George Soros and Michael Masters, a hedge-fund operator, the only thing wrong with the oil market is the market itself. Speculators, they say, drove the price away from its ''fundamental'' value; worse, a new breed of institutional investor has been buying oil futures, hoarding the supply. Masters compares these investors to the Hunt brothers, the Texas billionaires who cornered the silver market in the late '70s -- until silver crashed and the Hunts landed in bankruptcy. Essentially, he says, the oil price is, or was, seriously ''wrong'' -- a distortion caused by traders that has little to do with the amount of oil being produced and consumed.
 According to this view, oil traders are the culprits, as are the futures market and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the federal agency that regulates it. (The agency has also begun its own probe of the oil market.) Masters has fired off scores of e-mail messages to journalists and Wall Streeters, urging limits on speculators. (One message found its way to Senator Joe Lieberman.) Masters is not a disinterested party; his hedge fund has bet heavily on companies, like Delta Airlines, that have been punished by soaring oil prices. But his argument struck a populist chord. ''Speculators are driving up the price of food and energy for everyone else,'' he told me. Shad Rowe, a Dallas money manager, says the situation raises the bigger question of ''whether people in a complex society ought to be allowed to make bets that affect other people and that have nothing to do with them.''
 Of course, capitalism demands that people, or at least investors, make bets. That is how resources are allocated and money is invested where it is needed; high prices communicate scarcity. You could even say the oil market has performed a vital service to the country by telegraphing the need to conserve and to develop alternative supplies. The number of miles driven by Americans has declined, in recent months, by close to 5 percent. Consumers have abandoned S.U.V.'s, forcing Ford to speed up its plans to close truck factories and emphasize small cars. For similar reasons, General Motors and Chrysler are rushing to introduce electric cars. All of this is healthy, and none of it would have occurred in an environment of $20 oil. ''Should speculators go to jail,'' notes Robert Barbera, chief economist with the Wall Street firm ITG, ''or should they get the Congressional Medal of Honor?''
 In a sense, the question is whether we want to return to an era of plentiful oil and low prices -- assuming it is possible -- or to accept that political, geological and possibly environmental limitations will force us to diversify. The candidates, while talking tough about cutting our dependence on foreign oil, have supported some policies that seem inconsistent with that aim. Barack Obama has called for investment in alternative energy sources like wind and solar, and for ramping up production of cars that don't rely on gasoline. John McCain has supported offshore drilling and nuclear power. Such policies are responsive to the idea that energy, oil in particular, is a scarce resource. And a higher oil price is the most persuasive lobby for all of them. But on the stump, each candidate has inveighed against high gasoline prices -- as if prices were the problem, rather than a useful, albeit painful, signal that conventional supplies are running low. Obama supports a windfall tax on oil-company profits, a nonsolution that would discourage drilling and potentially worsen future shortages. (An Obama campaign flier asserts, ''While you're running on empty, Exxon made $4 billion in one month.'') McCain advocated a temporary repeal of the gas tax -- a measure that would do the most to revive Americans' love affair with big cars.
 Congress took a positive step toward energy conservation last year, raising mileage requirements to 35 miles per gallon, but the new standard will not take effect until 2020 and will not, even then, make cars in the U.S. as efficient as those now on the road in Europe, where the average is about 45 miles per gallon. Wind and solar credits were also extended as part of the financial-bailout bill. Congress also held hearings (with Michael Masters as a prime witness) probing the supposed harm done by oil speculators. Blaming speculators is good politics. In 1958, the government shut down the market for onion futures after a price spike, and recently the Securities and Exchange Commission has seemed to blame speculators for the havoc in bank stocks.
 The S.E.C. may not be all wrong, but oil trading and stock trading differ in an important respect. The stock market is a secondary market, in which investors merely exchange shares with one another. Except for the relatively rare occasions on which companies raise capital by selling new stock, changes in stock prices have little effect on nontraders, which means that mispricings (or bubbles) can persist for a long time. But commodity markets affect not just investors but also people who use the actual goods -- all of us, that is. 
 Crude oil and other energy products are quoted on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a vast commodities pit with giant, wall-to-wall screens that is also a market for metals like copper and gold. Traders at the Merc buy and sell oil for future delivery, and the price on the Merc serves as the reference price for oil shipments around the world. In other words, when a refinery contracts to buy crude oil from, say, Saudi Arabia, it generally agrees to pay the price on the Merc less a certain differential. (The discount depends on the quality of the oil being shipped.) Approximately 500,000 crude-oil futures contracts, representing 500 million barrels, trade on the Merc each day. By comparison, the world uses only 86 million barrels of oil daily. Though in theory the price on the Merc reflects the underlying supply-and-demand trends, on any given day the futures market often wags the physical market, not the other way around.
 Last June 5, for example, when the decrease in Americans' gasoline consumption was already apparent, crude oil inexplicably shot up $5.49 a barrel -- a record move. As analysts searched for an explanation, the following day oil soared like one of those fabled East Texas gushers -- up $10.75. According to Raymond Carbone, a floor trader on the Merc, two news items -- neither having anything to do with supply and demand -- were behind it. Jean-Claude Trichet, head of the European Central Bank, had made worrisome comments about inflation, which suggested that Trichet might raise interest rates, a step that could strengthen the euro and weaken the dollar. (When the dollar falls in currency markets, the price in dollars of international goods like vacations in France and barrels of crude oil generally goes up.) Also, an Israeli minister said it might be necessary to attack Iran. Israel did not attack -- nor did the minister's remark reflect any policy change -- and the dollar was about to get stronger. Nonetheless, Carbone, who was betting on the rally to continue, figured the rumors were good for a ride and maintained his bets.
 Looked at in isolation, trusting oil prices to Raymond Carbone and his peers on the Merc, and to their fellow speculators around the globe, does seem like madness. In two days, the price of a commodity that is a staple of everyday life rose 13 percent. According to a calculation by an energy economist at the Dallas Federal Reserve, that 48-hour market orgy weakened the future expected output of the U.S. economy by $90 billion, slicing more than half a percentage point off the gross domestic product.
 But the link to the real economy means that commodity prices tend to correct relatively quickly. After all, when the price of a good is too high, people buy less of it. Also, a futures contract is not just a gambling chit (though many people use it that way). Futures are agreements to buy or sell actual oil (or corn or soybeans, etc.) at a future moment at a particular price. This makes them especially useful to hedgers, who use futures to offset risks in their business. Southwest Airlines correctly anticipated that oil would go up, and via futures bought its jet fuel in advance at prices lower than today's.
 Most of the trading on the Merc is probably done by speculators, not hedgers, and the vast majority settle in cash before their contracts expire. But the fact that traders have the right to settle in kind provides an important check. Say that traders went truly nuts and drove the price to $200 a barrel. Oil companies would take advantage and sell $200 oil by the boatload. Either the people who took delivery would be able to find customers for such expensive oil or -- more likely -- they would go broke, and the price would come crashing down.
 The system sounds wacky, but those that preceded it were hardly better. Beginning in the 1870s, John D. Rockefeller tried to control oil's price by monopolizing the distribution -- until his company, Standard Oil, was dismantled in an antitrust case. In the 1930s, when oil sank to 10 cents a barrel, the state of Texas adopted a system that mimicked Rockefeller's -- or at least got the same result. For the next three decades, the Texas Railroad Commission controlled supplies by restricting well operators to a fixed number of production days per month. Then, in 1960, Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, which by then had supplanted Texas as the center of the oil world, founded the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with the same principle in mind. (In fact, the founders hired a former Railroad Commission engineer to show them the ropes.) Since 1983, when the Merc introduced the crude-oil contract, investors and traders have largely assumed the cartel's former function of setting prices.
 The reason that the history of oil is basically one of attempted price fixing is that, as technology has improved, drilling costs have fallen, meaning that prices have been under near-continuous downward pressure. Like most commodities, oil should sell for whatever the cost of producing one additional unit is -- in this case, one more barrel. Economists call this the ''marginal'' cost. If someone charges much more than that, a competitor can offer to sell it more cheaply.
 It's only when oil is scarce that things become interesting. If there isn't enough to go around, then the marginal cost no longer matters because, at the margin, there is no more oil to produce. Under such conditions, oil will rise to the price at which people stop using it -- either because they drive less or because they find another energy source. This is called the price of demand destruction. Think of that as the upper bound on the price. With the twin shocks of the '70s -- the Arab embargo and the Iranian revolution -- oil did reach an upper bound, jumping tenfold to $40 a barrel in 1981. Demand quickly collapsed, and the price eventually sank all the way back to the marginal cost, $12.
 Low prices were good news for consumers but a mixed blessing for society. Since it takes time for oil companies, as well as consumers, to react to price changes, markets tend to respond with a perilous lag. In the '80s, oil companies were spending billions looking for oil, and Detroit was retooling its plants to make smaller cars, even as the price of oil was collapsing.
 In the mid-1980s the oil industry suffered a terrible slump. Thousands of petroleum engineers were fired or left the business. Congress lost interest in energy conservation, and projects to develop shale oil and other alternatives were dropped. In Europe, high fuel taxes meant that people still had an incentive to conserve. In America, families became unwilling to ride in anything but trucks.
 Even as oil prices rose in this decade, big oil companies -- still responding to the price signal of an earlier period -- plowed most of their cash flow into dividends and stock repurchases rather than risk it on exploration. State oil companies overseas, like Saudi Arabia's, which control four-fifths of the world's reserves, refused to make the investment to develop their fields to full potential for fear of flooding the market (another reaction to low prices). For similar reasons, there was a lull in building critically needed refineries.
 By the time oil companies woke up to the consequences of low prices, it was in some sense too late. There was ''a missing generation of engineers,'' according to Daniel Yergin, the chairman of Cambridge Energy Research Associates and the author of ''The Prize,'' a history of the oil industry. There was also a lack of drilling rigs and men to work them. Drilling costs soared, and equipment was often unavailable. Also, countries where oil is abundant, like Russia and Venezuela, were increasingly chauvinistic and hostile to foreign operators. Civil unrest set back production in Nigeria.
 By the middle of this decade, various big oil regions -- Mexico, Nigeria, the North Sea, Colombia, Venezuela -- were experiencing production declines. Matthew Simmons, an energy banker in Houston, made a startling forecast: the entire world's oil production, he said, was peaking and was headed for irreversible decline.
 Simmons was dismissed as an alarmist, and much of what he said was extreme. He spoke of a looming, postglobal economy in which transportation grinds to a halt, almost a literal return to the Dark Ages. This isn't going to happen. At least not right away. The world has 1.3 trillion barrels of proven reserves, enough for 40 years at current rates of consumption. ''Peak oil is about geology,'' notes Marianne Kah, chief economist at ConocoPhillips. ''I don't think we are running out of oil. We are running out of access to oil.''
 Kah is right: there is plenty of oil. But it cannot be withdrawn at will like money from an A.T.M.; wells yield only so much liquid per day. And since the flow from aging wells declines by about 5 percent a year, producers that stand pat will shrink. To stay even requires investment -- and usually, the incentive of a high price. It also takes time. Thus, in the short run, whether the constraints on supplies are geologic or human may not matter.
 What frightened markets last spring was the awareness that capacity was flattening at the same time that a strong global economy was pushing demand rapidly higher. And emerging nations would seem to have a lot of oil-demand growth ahead of them. While the U.S. consumes 25 barrels of oil per capita annually and Europe 10 barrels, each Chinese consumes 2 barrels a year. Given their numbers, even a small amount of growth in Chinese consumption will offset a great deal of conservation in the U.S. Rising demand is especially ominous in light of Buffett's point: there is less spare capacity than in the previous decade. Before, if a war or hurricane were to interrupt supplies, Saudi Arabia could always open the tap farther. Soon there might not be enough. ''Imagine if you and I were trading jelly beans,'' Ken Hersh, who runs an energy fund, offered in a telling metaphor. ''We both love jelly beans, we know our kids are going to like 'em, and our kids' kids, and five years from now we have to make a trade and we look in the jar and there is only one jelly bean left.'' As traders wondered what would happen if there was a natural or man-made disaster, they were pricing each barrel as if it were the very last jelly bean.
 Institutions also have been counting jelly beans. After the stock-market disasters of the dot-com collapse in 2000 and Enron in 2001, big investors began to look for alternatives to stocks. Wall Street promoted commodities as the answer, and institutions like Harvard University and the California Public Employees' Retirement System have taken a flier on commodity indexes that are heavily weighted in oil. Masters is incensed because such investors tend to hold for the long haul and thus, he claims, to remove supplies from the market. Then again, commodities could be just the latest fad. Literature from A.I.G., the recently rescued insurer, described commodities as ''an asset class which has returns that have historically been comparable to stock returns but with lower volatility.'' This is a gross distortion. (It is true only if you calculate the returns in a highly stylized manner.) The fact is that from 1975 to 2005, the average commodity did not keep up with inflation, much less with the stock market. Whether it is wise to invest pensions and endowments in rocks is, of course, their business, but it is hard to see why they should be less free than others to express an opinion -- even if it does feed into prices. This, in fact, is what speculators are supposed to do: translate (however imperfectly) expectations about the future into today's price.
 You can argue that last July's $147 peak was irrational, but Aubrey McClendon, the chief executive of the Oklahoma-based Chesapeake Energy, says it was merely the answer to a real-world economics quiz: at what price would the world consume less oil? Americans began to cut back on their driving at $50 oil, and at something like $120 oil they garaged their S.U.V.'s en masse. People in many emerging nations were slower to react, because their governments subsidize local gasoline prices. But as the price rose, such a subsidy became costly, and beginning in May, China, India, Indonesia and others cut their subsidies. The upper bound had been reached.
 It's actually the lower bound that should concern Washington now. When you ask economists what the minimum oil price is to sustain the development of alternatives to gasoline -- new battery systems or sugar ethanol or even wood chips -- you get a range of something like $75 a barrel to maybe $150.
 Marginal costs for oil are less than those for alternative technologies, though they are rising. The marginal barrels today are found in remote and costly terrain, like the Canadian tar sands or off the coast of Brazil under 7,000 feet of seawater and more than 10,000 feet of ocean floor.
 One intriguing alternative is natural gas. Its price also soared, from $2 per thousand cubic feet to $13. And while U.S. oil production has been falling for four decades, the gas industry is experiencing a revival. Most recently, gas companies have embarked on a frantic quest to lease land in a vast, wooded region of the Northeast known as the Marcellus Shale that may contain more natural gas than anywhere else in America. The drilling uses a new technology to inject water deep below the surface to split apart the shale, then underground drilling continues horizontally for hundreds of feet.
 Farmers in the Marcellus who once leased land for $2 an acre are reaping fortunes. One 73-year-old dairy farmer leased 1,100 acres for $2.5 million. There could be many more like him out there. The United States has a lot of untapped shale, and there is no engineering reason that America could not substitute gas, which is cleaner and produces only half as much carbon as oil, for much of its driving. Eight million cars in the world already run on natural gas, though very few in the U.S. do. To Barbera, the economist, whose family owns some land in the Marcellus, it proves that technology will frustrate Thomas Malthus, the classical economist who forecast catastrophic, population-induced food shortages. The only risk in the Marcellus is that falling prices will sabotage the entire enterprise. Last summer,when gas was at a peak, Barbera told me that the gas companies rushing to sign up farmers reminded him of the way venture capitalists once threw money at Web sites. They shouldn't be asking how high gas can go, he said; they should be asking at what price does the drilling stop.
 Bingo. Gas has fallen to $7. If it falls much more, the Marcellus looks a lot less interesting. And if oil falls to $70, so do other alternatives.
 It would be a tragedy if falling prices were to extinguish such alternatives and -- given the time lag inherent in energy development -- leave the country vulnerable to a yet another round of shocks. There is no disputing, as Ben Bernanke said, that recently falling oil prices are giving the economy a shot in the arm. But new energy projects also create jobs, and though oil prices impose a cost, Europe has lived with high prices (because of the imposition of taxes) and adjusted to them.
 What can Washington do now? McClendon, the Chesapeake chief executive, whose company is active in the Marcellus, is angling for federal subsidies to help service stations convert to natural gas. This is what every energy pioneer wants: subsidies for what it does. But Congress is probably not the optimal institution for anointing technological winners. Its mandate to use corn for ethanol, while it has done wonders for Iowa farmers, has led to sharply higher corn prices and has not added much (if anything) to the country's energy supply. And even if politicians act with the purest of motives, there are simply too many possibilities for the car of tomorrow (fuel cells, nickel-hydride or lithium-ion batteries, natural gas, biofuel from wood chips and oil itself) to know which will prove the most feasible.
 The government could help finance basic research, but there is no reason to rule out any source -- oil included. By restricting offshore drilling, the United States is shunning an estimated 18 billion barrels of oil (equal to 80 percent of our proven reserves). As McClendon says, it's hard to fault Mexico or Saudi Arabia for not developing their fields to the max when the U.S. declares its own territory off-limits.
 What the country doesn't want is to remain dependent only on oil -- to lose the urgency to develop alternatives. It happened once before. After the gas lines of the '70s, Jimmy Carter declared that solving our energy problems was the moral equivalent of war. Then, in the 1980s, Americans forgot.
 The way to avoid a repeat is to dust off an idea that Gerald Ford once proposed: a tax on oil. Ideally, it would kick in only if the price fell back to, say, $70 a barrel. The beauty of this tax is that, very likely, no one would have to pay it. The tax would merely serve as a floor -- a new lower bound. Auto companies would never have to worry that cheap gas would tempt consumers away from efficient cars; investors could finance development of batteries and fuel cells, because cheap oil could never undercut them. Oil itself would be used more sparingly and last longer. The oil market did its part when it sent the price to almost $150. The government should make sure there is no going back.

HEADLINE: Lure of Big-Time Sports Propels Rutgers

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME. 
E-mail: peappl@nytimes.com

DATELINE: NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. 

 BODY:
 Art Applegate, who played football at Rutgers in the 1960s, when the opponents tended to be Princeton, Lehigh and Colgate, not West Virginia, South Florida and Louisville, is standing outside the chain-link fence, peering down at the most notorious unbuilt seats in New Jersey.
 That would be the 13,000 proposed seats in the south end zone that make up the bulk of the $102 million addition to Rutgers Stadium that began with more enthusiasm than resources and has since gone south on both counts. 
 Maybe the project needs to be delayed or scaled back, he says. But as for big-time football at Rutgers, he can't imagine any path other than full speed ahead.
 ''I'm a firm believer in manning up and not apologizing about it,'' Mr. Applegate says, sipping Diet Pepsi from a KFC cup as he looks down at the pilings meant to complete the bowl around the stadium where he once played. ''If it was up to me, we'd try to join the Big Ten. Look what football has done for Penn State. We don't need to be playing Princeton anymore. It's a state university. I say act like it.''
 Mr. Applegate is probably a bit more gung-ho than most. But he's probably on the winning side in a parable of university life that goes well beyond the losing record of the Rutgers Scarlet Knights this dour autumn. This year is playing out like the reverse of the 11-2, feel-good season two years ago that was hailed as Rutgers's emergence as a football power.
 Yes, there's a revived online version of the Rutgers 1000, the group of professors, students and alumni who protested the growth of the sports program without much success during the 1990s. The group is bitterly opposed to the stadium project and the leadership of the athletic department.
 But the president of Rutgers, Richard L. McCormick, while acknowledging that the university needs to reshape its oversight and ethics policies and that it faces a severe cash crunch that is likely to scale back the stadium project, says that turning back from big-time sports is not an option. He says that the $50 million sports budget is less than 3 percent of the university's $1.75 billion budget. The university provides $15 million of the athletic budget, with the rest coming from ticket sales and other sources. Dr. McCormick then reels off a list of the big-time public universities with big-time sports: Michigan, Virginia, North Carolina, Berkeley and the rest. For better or worse, that's the way the game is played at America's public universities.
 ''This is a policy that's been in place for a long time,'' he says. ''We're going to stay the course.''
 If any state university might try to create a different model, you would think it might be Rutgers, which was established in 1766, was a private college for most of its existence, is relatively new to the athletic big time and has fought furious intramural battles for two decades over big-time sports.
 Many students chafe at the idea of all the money being spent on football while tuition and room and board have gone up 6.5 percent this year, the State Legislature has cut financing to the university by 10.8 percent, the endowment has lost 10 percent of its value, and administrators are drawing up plans in case of further cuts. That said, most of those interviewed on Friday seemed to be questioning the execution, not the rationale. And lousy season or not, the waiting list for season tickets stands at 12,000. (Rutgers managed to beat Connecticut, 12-10, on Saturday to run its record to 2-5.)
 ''Before I came here, the main way I knew about Rutgers was through sports,'' said Peter Fabian, a freshman from Connecticut. ''It shouldn't take precedence over academics, but I think it's something most students want.''
 Kyle Jespersen, a senior, talked about football during his time at Rutgers like someone tracking the Dow. There was the euphoria -- call it irrational exuberance -- during the 2006 season, he said, followed by the university's decision to spend money it didn't have. 
 He said students wanted successful sports but not a program that upended the balance between academics and athletics. ''We shouldn't want to be Ohio State,'' he said. ''It's like everyone got scarlet and white fever, and not enough people were looking objectively and asking if this was a fluke.''
 In the immediate future, Rutgers is facing rising financing costs, a severe budget crunch and a depressed economy that has all but shut down the donations that were expected to help pay for the project. And the questions raised by The Star-Ledger of Newark about the financial management of Rutgers athletics have hurt the university's credibility with the Legislature at a time when it most needs it.
 Chances are the situation will get worse before it gets better, but you could take three lessons away.
 First: Whatever the costs and flaws, the lure of big-time sports in public institutions, and the idea of a payoff in applications and prestige for winning teams, seem to be stronger than ever.
 Second: Almost none of the issues about Rutgers sports would have come to light without The Star-Ledger, which has been facing threats to its continued existence. Anyone doubting the importance of a vigorous press need only contemplate New Jersey officials without it. 
 Third: Even in New Jersey, the cost of being lax or stupid with public money has gone way up. If, as seems inevitable, the financial pressures on Rutgers continue to increase, the cost of a little irrational exuberance is going to be a lot different than it was when the Dow was at 14,000 and all seemed well with the world.

HEADLINE: First, Investors' Real Estate Boom, and Now a Bust

BYLINE: By RUSS BUETTNER

 BODY:
IN another time, Wayne Puff, who had run a small limousine company and twice filed for bankruptcy, might not have won the confidence of major banks or investors with sizable portfolios.
But during the heady days of the real estate boom, some 1,200 investors from across the country poured $123.3 million into his company, New Jersey Affordable Homes. Mr. Puff advertised guaranteed annual returns of 15 to 20 percent from his business buying, renovating and reselling real estate.
Now, more than a decade after he began his real estate investment company, Mr. Puff, 60, of Old Bridge, N.J., is being held without bail in the Essex County Jail. Christopher J. Christie, the United States attorney for New Jersey, charged Mr. Puff in June with bilking investors and mortgage lenders through a Ponzi scheme based on mortgage fraud. His company was forced into receivership three years ago, but the mess is still being unwound.
The economic meltdown has focused national attention on Wall Street greed, freewheeling mortgage lenders and lax regulations. All this set the stage for what federal prosecutors say has been a sharp increase in mortgage fraud in neighborhoods across the country. This year, more than 400 people have been arrested on mortgage-fraud-related charges, according to the United States Justice Department. 
Federal prosecutors accused Mr. Puff of employing the usual elements of mortgage fraud: from offices in Woodbridge and Perth Amboy, N.J., he worked with a mortgage broker who fudged applications and appraisers who pumped up real estate values. Properties were flipped between insiders at artificially increasing prices. The scheme cost investors $55 million, saddled banks with $25 million in bad loans and plunged 400 New Jersey properties into legal limbo, according to court records. About half of the homes were in already struggling sections of Newark, Irvington and East Orange in Essex County.
So far, seven people who worked closely with Mr. Puff's company -- two appraisers, four employees and a paralegal for one of his lawyers -- have pleaded guilty on charges related to the scheme.
Some investors are still fighting for their money.
Milija Balabanovic, 82, said he invested a total of $350,000 with Mr. Puff starting in the late 1990s. A former landlord himself, he is once again banging his knuckles under kitchen sinks and mowing yards at two houses he bought with what little money he had left.
''I am not asking anyone to feel sorry for me or anything like that, but I was a self-made millionaire, and now I am a pauper,'' he said. ''Why he was allowed to do business I do not understand.''
Two of his longest-standing friends said they were surprised that Mr. Puff had built such a large enterprise. Lois Keegan said she first met Mr. Puff in the '80s when she was tending bar and he had just moved to New Jersey from Colorado, where he had worked as a ski instructor. She described him as a ''fun'' and ''adventurous'' guy who was the center of a group of 20 friends. She said he worked as a home-repair contractor and came up with a stream of marginal business ideas, including one she partook in called Lady Limousine.
''He had two women drivers, myself and somebody else,'' she said. ''I guess people didn't notice how rickety the limousine was because we were in cute little limousine driving outfits.''
By the early '90s, Mr. Puff was focused on his real estate investment firm, hiring dozens of employees and advertising extensively on radio and in newspapers. He hired as his in-house lawyer George J. Otlowski Jr., whose father was a former mayor of Perth Amboy and a longtime state assemblyman. (Mr. Otlowski has not been charged in the case.) And he arranged to accept money from I.R.A. accounts through Fiserv Trust Company, which administered $46 billion in self-directed retirement and custodial accounts. (Its parent company sold the unit to Ameritrade this year.)
All that suggested credibility in the minds of his investors.
Daniel Kelleher said he began investing with the company in 1995, as he prepared to retire from the Department of Defense. He brought in his brother, Bob, and several friends from a marina in Atlantic Highlands, N.J., where he kept a small boat.
Unbeknownst to them, the New Jersey Bureau of Securities raised concerns in 1996 about Mr. Puff's claimed returns and failure to register his securities. There were some discussions with state and federal regulators but no action was taken against Mr. Puff until three years later.
Meanwhile, Mr. Puff occasionally impressed investors with his fame as a swing dancer. Natalie Gomez, a three-time world swing-dancing champion, took Mr. Puff along for a group appearance on the ''Today'' show on NBC in 1998.
Mr. Kelleher said that Mr. Puff's grace and showmanship on his feet was matched by his facility with banter.
''We used to call him 'Twinkle Toes,' '' Mr. Kelleher said.
In 1999, the New Jersey Bureau of Securities filed a civil complaint in Essex County accusing Mr. Puff of selling unregistered securities. By then, Affordable Homes had 526 active investors who had put in a total of $23.4 million, the complaint said.
In 2002, Mr. Puff signed a consent decree in the case agreeing to stop listing multiple investors on the mortgages for single properties and to offer some investors a chance to pull their money out. His plans typically required investors to leave their money untouched for one to five years.
But most of his investors were not made aware of those actions. Under the agreement, only those eligible to withdraw money had to be notified. In a letter to those investors, Mr. Puff said the company could suffer cash flow problems as a result.
For help, he turned to one of his investors, Herman Gross, of Great Neck on Long Island, who had run a large apparel importing business in the city and owned 50 indoor tennis centers. Mr. Gross put in $2 million to finance the bailout and would eventually invest a total of $11.8 million.
Mr. Gross, 91, said in a court affidavit that he had thought Mr. Puff's ''business model was brilliant'' but that he needed to ''add more professional people.''
In November 2003, Mr. Puff hired Kenneth Lagonia, whom Mr. Puff described to investors as a Wall Street veteran. The next month Mr. Lagonia wrote a letter, which Mr. Puff showed to investors, saying he had received a ''verbal commitment'' for a $60 million bond.
''I am happy to advise you that we have completed our due diligence on Mr. Puff and his firm, and have found them to be honest and trustworthy, with a high degree of integrity,'' Mr. Lagonia added.
Earlier in 2003 a federal judge had released Mr. Lagonia from liability in a civil case the Securities and Exchange Commission had filed in 1998 against him, his partner in two businesses and other associates, charging they had swindled $1.7 million from three investors. A federal judge in Manhattan held that Mr. Lagonia, of Manorville on Long Island, had been involved in some transactions but was not aware of all the details.
The bond never arrived. But with Mr. Gross's cash and with regulators held at bay, Mr. Puff was on his way once again. He moved into new offices in Perth Amboy. He married Kyu Nam Park, a younger woman from Korea.
Some of his investors were catching on. Michael B. Debbs, 73, a boating friend of Mr. Kelleher's who had moved to North Carolina, drove by a property in Aberdeen, N.J., that was paying him, on paper at least, annual returns of 15 percent. He was startled to see a vacant lot.
''I smelled a rat.'' Mr. Debbs said. ''How can they be paying me all this interest and not doing anything with the property?'' He and Mr. Kelleher said they met with Mr. Puff and Mr. Lagonia, who both tried to reassure them. Mr. Debbs decided to pull out his money, and in June 2004 Mr. Puff agreed to begin paying him $10,000 a month.
Mr. Kelleher stayed in. So did his brother, Bob, who had invested about $200,000 that had grown to $500,000 on paper.
''I felt pretty confident,'' said Bob Kelleher, who works in construction in Topeka, Kan. ''The money was secured by mortgages. And as far as I was concerned, I was getting a statement every month from N.J.A.H., as well as Fiserv.''
By April 2005, Mr. Puff still hadn't returned $275,000 to investors who had demanded their money after the 2002 consent decree. New Jersey officials quietly went back to court. Lucy Santiago, Mr. Puff's head of investor relations, stopped taking calls from angry investors, according to court records.
In 2005, nine years after he was first questioned by New Jersey regulators, the S.E.C. filed a civil complaint in federal court in Newark that resulted in the company being shut down and forced into receivership. The S.E.C. named Mr. Puff and later Mr. Lagonia as defendants.
An accounting firm determined that the company had lost $20.5 million from 1999 through 2003 and needed a monthly infusion of $265,000 in new investor money to stay afloat, according to papers filed in bankruptcy court in Newark. About 90 percent of its recent revenue had been generated by flipping the properties between investors and his employees used as straw buyers, according to the court papers.
Prosecutors and regulators accused the company of fraudulently claiming on mortgage applications that investors would live in the properties. Many of the company's 400 properties were in poor condition, according to Charles M. Forman, the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee. One house in Newark -- which Affordable Homes had bought for $18,250 in 2001 and sold to an investor for $212,000 in 2005 -- was deemed worthless and was demolished.
''The largest group of properties are those which are unoccupied and boarded up,'' Mr. Forman said in papers filed in bankruptcy court in Newark.
Seeking clear title to auction off the properties, Mr. Forman filed hundreds of lawsuits against the lenders and investors, many of whom felt victimized a second time.
''All of the sudden we went from investors to defendants,'' Mr. Kelleher said.
Mr. Kelleher, who had been told he had throat cancer, didn't want to fight the trustee while he was fighting for his life. He had taken out $60,000 in interest from his account, but the rest of his $150,000 investment, which his statements showed had grown to $300,000, is gone. His brother, Bob, 62, also didn't fight and put off plans to retire.
Mr. Debbs barely got his money out in time.
Mr. Balabanovic said the trustee offered to allow him to keep the $140,000 in interest he had withdrawn from his Affordable Homes account if he would give up his rights to the properties.
''That's not even-steven, as far as I'm concerned,'' he said. ''All I want is the $350,000 that I originally invested with him.''
At an auction at the Meadowlands sports complex last October, nearly all the properties sold for less than the mortgages Mr. Puff had on them.
It's not clear what will be left for investors. In a lawsuit against Mr. Puff filed in bankruptcy court, Mr. Forman accused Mr. Puff of pulling $5 million from the company during its last four years, often by taking company checks to check-cashing stores. The trustee won a $67.5 million default judgment against Mr. Puff. But all Mr. Puff's known bank accounts have long since been seized.
Mr. Puff's criminal lawyer, Thomas J. Moran of Newark, did not return calls. Court papers this month in the criminal case said plea negotiations were under way. Mr. Puff faces one count of wire fraud and one count of obstruction of justice, each carrying a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000.
His friends said Mr. Puff's wife returned to Korea. Ms. Keegan said she last heard from Mr. Puff more than a year ago, when he called and said he was ''in a lot of trouble'' and unable to disclose his location.
As it was for others who benefited from loose lending during the real estate boom, the party was over.
''When all this happened, we didn't want anything to do with him,'' she said. ''Sorry, Wayne, you're not fun anymore.''

HEADLINE: The Bubble Keeps On Deflating

 BODY:
By now everyone knows that reckless and even predatory mortgage lending provoked the financial meltdown. But bad lending did not stop there. The easy money also fed a corporate buyout binge, with private equity firms borrowing huge sums to buy up public companies and pay themselves big dividends. 
 The process was much like a homeowner who borrowed big for a house and then refinanced to pull out cash. In corporate buyouts, however, the newly private company was left with the fat loan, while the private equity partners got the cash. 
 In keeping with the mania of the era, banks lowered their lending standards as they competed fiercely to make buyout loans. Lenders also did not worry much about being repaid, because they made money by slicing and dicing the buyout loans and selling them off in pieces to investors. 
 All of this means that the country needs to brace for yet another round of trouble: a potentially sharp increase in corporate bankruptcies. This time, government officials and Congress must not be taken by surprise. 
 So far relatively few companies have gone bust. But that is not necessarily a hopeful sign. Instead, loose lending has very likely allowed many troubled companies to postpone a day of reckoning -- but not forever.
 Under the lax terms of many buyout loans (deemed ''covenant lite''), borrowers could delay payments, say, by issuing i.o.u.'s in lieu of payment or adding the interest to the loan balance rather than paying it. But when the loans come due and need to be repaid or refinanced, terms will no longer be so easy. The likely result will be defaults and bankruptcies. 
 A rash of corporate bankruptcies would obviously be very bad news for employees and lenders, and for stockholders at troubled public companies, like the carmakers. It could also rock the financial system anew.
 As with mortgages, huge side bets have been placed on the performance of corporate debt via derivative securities, like credit default swaps. Derivatives are unregulated, so no one can be sure how widely a big or unexpected default would reverberate through the system. 
 Various measures indicate elevated default risk at a range of businesses, including retailers, media companies, restaurants and manufacturers. A survey released this month by the Federal Reserve and other regulators is especially sobering. 
 It looked at $2.8 trillion in large syndicated corporate loans held by American banks at the end of June. Compared with a year earlier, the share of loans rated as problematic had risen from 5 percent to 13.4 percent. 
 Regulators must continue to monitor possible bankruptcies. Even if they cannot prevent a failure, they can soften its impact by ensuring that it does not come as a shock, further spooking investors. 
 Congress must prepare to deal with higher unemployment from corporate failures. In the coming lame duck session, lawmakers must extend jobless benefits for people who have exhausted their previous allotment. The next Congress and the next president need to upgrade the nation's outmoded system of unemployment compensation to cover more Americans. 
 Congress must also be prepared to investigate large or particularly disruptive bankruptcies to identify both possible unlawful activity and regulatory lapses.
 So far, inquiries into the collapses of Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and American International Group have been little more than public hazings of corporate executives. What is needed is a serious effort to determine accountability and figure out what reforms are needed to make sure these disasters don't happen again.

HEADLINE: A Stark and Sensual 'Of Mice and Men'

BYLINE: By ANITA GATES

 BODY:
If you arrive late for ''Of Mice and Men'' at the Westport Country Playhouse, the entrance and exit of Curly's wife (John Steinbeck never gave the character a name) will help clear things up fast.
 Betsy Morgan plays the young, shapely, lonely, overtly seductive wife as if Madonna had taken over an early Lana Turner role. And when, after a pointed conversation, she slinks out of the bunkhouse, temporary home to many of the other characters, the two leads comment on her. 
 George (Brian Hutchison) calls her a tramp.
 Lennie (Mark Mineart) responds, ''Gosh, she's purty.'' 
 So, for those who never read Steinbeck's 1937 novella or saw a film, television or stage adaptation, the dynamics are clear. George is a relatively intelligent, cynical ranch hand. Lennie is his gentle, simple-minded friend who can work as hard as any man but wanders through life with the sensibility and defenses of a child. Most important, he doesn't know his own physical strength, and that may be his downfall. 
 A 71-year-old drama set in Depression-era California, about men with small dreams doomed to fail, may strike some as a little too close to home as the nation's economy slouches toward recession or worse. But Westport's potent production has a vitality and sensuality that remind us that every life is touched by loneliness and failure.
 More than once, Mark Lamos's vigorous direction yields dual-edged dramatic tension. The first time, Carlson (Tommy Nohilly), one of the established ranch hands, urges the oldest worker, Candy (Edward Seamon), to put his handsome but elderly dog out of his misery. More accurately, he nags at Candy, suggesting strongly that he take out his firearm right there, then aim and shoot. Candy's weak but heartfelt response is always ''I've had him since he was a pup.'' Eventually Carlson takes the dog outside and everyone waits, frozen in horrible anticipation.
 Mr. Seamon is extremely touching as Candy, but if you were looking for the best supporting actor in this production, he'd hardly be the only nominee. Consider Kene Holliday, who plays Crooks, the lone black man on the ranch. Just as Steinbeck's dialogue (yes, he did adapt his own book for Broadway way back when) pulls no punches in the casual use of racial epithets, Mr. Holliday commits completely to a beaten-down, isolated and deeply angry African-American attitude of the time.
 Crooks hates not being able to sleep in the bunkhouse with the other hands. He has a room to himself in the barn and, he tells the other men, nothing but books as company. Imagine Morgan Freeman's docile chauffeur in ''Driving Miss Daisy'' suddenly speaking up and telling the unvarnished truth.
 But this is George and Lennie's story. They are on the road together, going from job to job (as many of the unemployed did during the Depression), hoping to earn enough money to buy a place of their own, where they can farm, raise animals and live off the fat of the land. The dream seems tantalizingly close, especially after Candy offers to contribute.
 The other men are suspicious of George and Lennie's relationship. ''I never seen one guy do so much nice for another fellow,'' says one. But George explains that neither man has any family left and that Lennie is a cousin. In case 1930s readers might have inferred homosexuality, Steinbeck cut off that line of thought by making it clear that George found female companionship in periodic brothel visits.
 The men have had to leave town before, when Lennie has innocently caused trouble. But finally, here on this new job, Lennie, the kind of man who can accidentally kill a puppy just by petting it, goes too far. And George has to take responsibility for him in the only way he knows how. Or the only way the world he lives in will accept.
 Michael Yeargan's bleak and beautiful scenic design adds considerably to the impact.
 Few Westport theatergoers can see ''Of Mice and Men'' without remembering that Paul Newman had been set to direct it but dropped out for health reasons. The production is dedicated to Mr. Newman, who died three weeks ago. 
 ''Of Mice and Men,'' by John Steinbeck, is at the Westport Country Playhouse, 25 Powers Court, through Nov. 1. Information: (203) 227-4177 or westportplayhouse.org.

IRAQIS MARCH IN PROTEST
Of Security Agreement
Followers of the anti-American cleric Moktada al-Sadr demonstrated in Baghdad against the proposed security agreement between the American and Iraqi government. And there were signs that the Iraqi unease with the security negotiations still stretch beyond Mr. Sadr's faction. Quietly, some parliamentary leaders suggested that they, too, were not comfortable with the measure. PAGE 8
MONEY WOES IN HUNGARY
As their government did for its needs, average Hungarians flocked to banks for once-cheap loans in Swiss francs and euros to buy their cars and houses. As a result, they are now exposed to rising payments as the economy and the local currency suffer. The government has taken steps to shore up its position. All the people can do is wait and hope for the best. PAGE 10 
REPORT ON IRANIAN CAMPS
American officials have long cited Iranian training and weapons as reasons for the lethality of attacks by Shiite fighters in Iraq. Iranian officials deny that such training takes place. Now, newly declassified intelligence documents describe in detail an elaborate network used by Iraqis to gain entry into Iran and train under Iranian supervision. They support American claims about Iranian efforts to build a proxy force in Iraq. PAGE 6

A SHOW OF PERSEVERANCE
On the High Plains
Marsau's, an auto parts supply shop in Sterling, Colo., was founded in the age of Model A's and 17-cent gas. It has survived because it diversified, said John C. Wray II, the owner. ''Everybody else quit, or died.'' It is that very kind of high plains persistence that inspired James A. Michener as he researched his 1974 novel ''Centennial.'' PAGE 17
UNABANDONING A SHIP
The Falls of Clyde, a 266-foot square rigger built in Scotland in 1878, is the last survivor of the sailing-ship days of Honolulu Harbor. How much longer it will survive is an open question: it was destined for sinking, and the current rescue attempt is its second. PAGE 18
CANDIDATES' RARE ACCORD
A rare policy agreement between Senator John McCain and Senator Barack Obama on global warming has both industry and environmental groups expecting a big shift, no matter who is elected, on climate legislation, expansion of nonpolluting energy sources and leadership in global talks on creating a new climate treaty. If finances allow, that is. PAGE 20

The last time Brett Favre played in Oakland, where he returns with the Jets on Sunday, it was one of the worst days of his life. His father, Irvin, had died at age 58 the day before, after having a heart attack while driving near their hometown in Mississippi. But what followed was one of the most memorable games that make up the legend of Brett Favre. PAGE 1
A DIFFERENT MANNING
In years past, a performance like Eli Manning's against the Cleveland Browns last week (interceptions, frustration evident) might have triggered speculation that he was not up to the job. But an N.F.L. title affords him some slack. The Manning of 2008 has a ''reservoir of confidence,'' says Kevin Gilbride, the Giants' offensive coordinator. PAGE 1

A Queens community group that is under investigation for possible political work on behalf of Councilman Hiram Monserrate could not produce paperwork to show how it spent nearly $250,000 in city money that the councilman had directed to it, city audits show. The group, Libre, which was overseen by Mr. Monserrate's chief of staff, got money for services like assistance to immigrants. PAGE 28
NEW YORK, NO YORK
''When the aliens shoot up a grain silo, we yawn,'' Michael Miscione, the Manhattan borough historian, says.

The economic turmoil in the United States has spread to Europe, with one positive bit of fallout for travelers: The travel market is getting cheaper, including deals on air fares and hotels. Not bargain basement yet, but more affordable. And the dollar is edging up, too, providing a built-in discount. PAGE 3
MONASTIC DOORS OPENING
Europe's convents and monasteries are increasingly throwing open their iron-bound doors to overnight visitors. They're building Web sites, offering online booking, and some have even added spa offerings, looking for more than just religious travelers. And they trend cheaper than hotels.

As a summer replacement for ''The Jackie Gleason Show'' in 1968, ''The Prisoner'' could not have been a more startling change of pace.

HEADLINE: Through Boom and Bust, Hanging On in the High Plains

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: STERLING, Colo. 

 BODY:
Perseverance and practicality are dominant themes here in the corn and wheat country of northeastern Colorado. Some people and places find the right combination and hang on; others blow away in the nearly constant wind. 
 The same goes for business cycles and economic crises, people here say. They come and they go, and in the long view -- easy to find in a place where you can see for 50 miles -- getting through is about pluck and luck.
 ''We diversified,'' said John C. Wray II, the owner of Marsau's, an auto parts supply shop founded right before the Great Depression in the age of Model A's and 17-cent gas. ''Everybody else quit, or died.'' 
 Marsau's, set in a low-rise red-brick building and unchanged in decor since it opened in 1928, is a story of survival writ small. The wooden shelves are deeply grooved from use. Dogs lounge underfoot in the sun that streams through an open door on a fall afternoon. The grime and grit remain enthusiastically unscrubbed.
 In his 1974 novel ''Centennial,'' James A. Michener created a fictional high plains town, and researched much of the story here, where an autographed copy of the book is proudly displayed at the Overland Trail Museum. The deep cycles of life Mr. Michener captured live on in this community of 11,000 people, perhaps even more fiercely now as the storm clouds of a national economic downturn gather on the horizon.
 Don Bilyeu, better known as Shorty, the parts manager who began manning the front counter at Marsau's in August 1959, when he was 24, has seen all the fads, from tail fins to S.U.V.'s. Tractors, though, are what seem to hang on forever, said Mr. Bilyeu, 73, mainly because of the tight-fisted farmers who will work a good piece of machinery down to its last rusted nub.
 The generator for a 1950s-vintage International came in just this week, ready to be rebuilt yet again. That leads to Emanuele Campanella's part of the shop. He works in the back, rebuilding generators and alternators. 
 Mr. Campanella, known as Campy, is 87, and arrived at Marsau's through a circuitous path that would seem far-fetched even in fiction. 
 He was a soldier in the Italian Army in North Africa in 1943 -- unenthusiastic about the fighting, he said, but happy to work on engines, which was his main duty -- when Allied forces encircled more than 200,000 Italians and Germans in Tunisia after the Battle of El Alamein. The battle turned the tide of World War II in Africa, and brought Mr. Campanella to the United States.
 He was sent to a prisoner-of-war camp 35 miles from Sterling, just across the Nebraska border, where he began to learn English and flirt with a curly-haired beauty, Edith Rocker, who lived in Sterling and worked as a civilian in the camp. She followed Mr. Campanella to Italy after the war, where they married in his hometown of Genoa, then back to Sterling in 1947. She died young, in her 30's. Mr. Campanella remarried, but kept up his love affair with all things mechanical.
 ''If I had a million dollars I'd be here tomorrow morning,'' Mr. Campanella said as he bustled around the back. ''I wouldn't know where to go; I'd be lost.''
 KC's Music, a CD and audio component shop on Main Street, has a survival story, too, in facing off against its competition -- in this case, Wal-Mart, which came to Sterling in the mid-1980s. 
 KC's owner, Chris Delgado, realized he could never compete on price, so he beefed up selection and began offering deals that Wal-Mart could not match -- copying music for customers from his private collection, if it is not available, and giving it away. Mr. Delgado studied the width of Wal-Mart's aisles and expanded the open spaces in his store so that older people and teenagers -- his main customer base -- did not have to bump elbows.
 ''With younger and older customers there's a little friction,'' Mr. Delgado said. 
 Now Mr. Delgado looks at the economic storm -- much of which has yet to hit Sterling -- and thinks he will make it through. But then he shrugs.
 ''It's going to be slow and it's going to be low and we're going to lose a few businesses around here, and who knows, ours may be one,'' Mr. Delgado said. 
 For now, the signals are mixed. Corn and wheat prices -- as much or more of a focus here than the Dow Jones industrial average -- have fallen sharply from their highs this year. Wheat was $12 a bushel in late winter and is now below $6; corn has fallen to about $4 a bushel, from $6.
 But 400 construction workers are scheduled to arrive here next year to build a big wind turbine farm, and the town is projecting a 3.5 percent increase in sales tax revenues next year partly from the local, if temporary, jolt of the workers' wages.
 And the medical center, Sterling Regional, a 36-bed acute care hospital, is seeing an improvement in business precisely because times are tough. An increase in admissions and treatment began this spring, mainly for people who said they previously would have driven to the big hospitals in Denver, two hours away, and now wanted to save on the gas money.
 Meanwhile, Mr. Campanella, between rebuilding generators, is battling moles. 
 They plague his two acres near the Interstate. So Mr. Campanella has been constructing a device out of a two-liter soda bottle that he thinks will get the job done.
 The concept is based, like the wind turbines that are changing economics for the farmers, on the famous high plains wind. It blows through the baffles that Mr. Campanella has cut in the side of the bottles, which are then mounted on a stick directly over the moles' holes. The fluttering, hooting wind noise is intensely disturbing to the average mole.
 That is the theory, anyway.
 ''They get scared and they run,'' Mr. Campanella said.

HEADLINE: On Reality TV, Even 'Survivor' Looks Mortal

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

DATELINE: Los Angeles 

 BODY:
 HUNCHED over a carved wooden coffee table in his office, studying drawings of a river relay race that ''Survivor'' contestants will soon endure, Mark Burnett sounds every bit the acclaimed television producer he is.
 He nods approvingly, calling it ''epic.'' But he worries that he's seen the race once before. 
 ''We haven't done this one since Season 2,'' responds Jeff Probst, the host of ''Survivor.'' Another colleague, John Kirhoffer, does the arithmetic in his head. ''It's been 16 seasons,'' he says, sounding rather astonished. 
 Mr. Burnett can't resist ribbing him. ''Did you have gray hairs then?'' he asks. ''No, but I had more hair then,'' Mr. Kirhoffer says. 
 ''Survivor'' introduced reality television to mainstream American audiences eight years ago on CBS, and for two viewing seasons a year it continues to draw a bigger audience than almost any other show. When it started, it was almost inconceivable that regular people could be prime-time TV stars. '' 'Survivor' turned TV on its head,'' says Leslie Moonves, the chief executive of CBS. 
 But the series -- once renowned for rejuvenating CBS and drawing young viewers to the network -- is showing its age. So, too, is the competition-based reality format that has dominated television for nearly a decade. 
 The innovations of ''Survivor'' are evident in almost every reality show on the market, from ''America's Next Top Model'' on the CW to ''Paris Hilton's My New BFF'' on MTV. It's a copy-and-paste format: collect a diverse cast of strangers, pit them against one another and expel a contestant at the end of each episode. Last year, CBS applied it to a sea expedition on ''Pirate Master'' and with children on ''Kid Nation,'' but the concepts were canceled after one season. 
 ''After eight years, you've got to wonder what's left to come up with,'' said David C. Joyce, a media equity analyst at Miller Tabak & Company who follows CBS.
 That doesn't mean networks will stop trying to dream up new reality shows. They are a proven way to keep costs down, and are especially valuable in a precarious economy. 
 Already, analysts say, the downturn is pressuring advertisers. Most TV ad time is sold in advance during presentations each spring, but ''there are concerns that advertisers may not make good on their commitments,'' Mr. Joyce said.
 Furthermore, analysts say sales of spot advertising have slowed recently. If the economy goes into a long recession, companies short of cash will be tempted to trim their ad budgets even further. Earlier this month, CBS cut its forecast for the fiscal year, projecting that operating income would fall by midteen percentages, versus the previous year. Three months ago, it had forecast growth of 3 to 5 percent.
 Given that bleak picture, CBS will continue to milk every nickel out of ''Survivor'' as long as it can. And despite a 50 percent drop in viewership in the last eight years, ''Survivor'' is still a hit by many measures. It remains No. 1 in its 8 p.m. Thursday time slot -- a remarkable feat for any show -- and continues to earn many tens of millions for the network. 
 In the second week of October, ''Survivor: Gabon'' was No. 9 on the list of most popular programs among the 18- to 49-year-old viewers that advertisers pay a premium to reach. ''The length and strength of this run -- and I obviously believe it will continue -- is pretty astounding,'' Mr. Moonves said.
 For people like Mr. Probst, ''it's not an understatement to say that the show changed my life,'' he says. But Mr. Probst was clear-eyed in a conversation at the offices of Mark Burnett Productions as he discussed the ratings in terms of the inevitable life cycle of television. ''They will continue to dissipate until we're off the air. Just like every other show,'' he said.
 A glance at this year's prime-time schedule confirms that formats like that of ''Survivor'' are no longer the sole staple of reality TV. The revival of ''American Gladiators'' grabbed attention for NBC last winter, and ''The Moment of Truth,'' the lie-detector game show, made headlines for Fox in the spring. And the humiliating obstacle course ''Wipeout'' was an ABC hit over the summer.
 The task for Mr. Burnett's staff, then, isn't to expand the ''Survivor'' brand. It's to manage the decline.
 IT'S easy now, long after ''Survivor'' was born, to forget how audacious the concept was.
 Real people, 16 ordinary Americans, would be stranded on a desert island and forced to compete for basic necessities. Every three days, a contestant would be sent home. The winner, after 39 days in the wilderness, would receive $1 million. ''No food, no water, no fire. Imagine how shocking that was'' for viewers, said Ghen Maynard, who pushed for ''Survivor'' to earn a spot on the CBS schedule and subsequently headed alternative programming for the network until last August. 
 The show's distinct nature made it a phenomenon almost overnight. When the first season ended in the summer of 2000, more than 50 million people were watching, making it the No. 2 program of the year, behind the Super Bowl. 
 Given the first season's success, CBS made the daring decision to schedule the second season on Thursdays at 8, the first hour of network television's most lucrative night. ''Survivor'' was facing the NBC sitcom ''Friends,'' then TV's most popular program. 
 Mr. Probst asked Kelly Kahl, head of scheduling for CBS, why the network seemed to be setting up ''Survivor'' to fail. Mr. Kahl's reply: ''When you have a sledgehammer, you have to use it.''
 Shari Anne Brill, the senior vice president and director for programming at Carat, the media services agency, said ''Survivor'' gave CBS a signature show and ''a completely different reputation,'' drawing younger viewers. 
 The candle burned brightly, and at CBS, executives wondered how long it would last. ''If you can find anyone who says they thought it would run for 16 seasons, I would probably call them a liar,'' Mr. Kahl said. A Newsweek cover titled ''Secrets of Survivor'' still adorns his office wall.
 After the show's success, CBS introduced ''Big Brother,'' about a group of unrelated people living in the same house, and ''The Amazing Race,'' which has won 11 Emmys. (This year, Mr. Probst was the first to win an Emmy in the new category of reality show host.)
 The second season of ''Survivor,'' in early 2001, was its most successful and its only season ranking No. 1 in prime time. The show continued to flirt with 20 million weekly viewers through Season 10, in 2005. But its audience has steadily dwindled, from 18.3 million for the 11th season, in Guatemala, to 13.6 million for the season in Micronesia this year.
 Over time, new formats of reality shows started to supplement ''Survivor.'' ''American Idol,'' the singing competition on Fox, has been prime time's most popular show for five seasons. ''The Osbournes,'' ''The Hills'' and other semi-real soap operas on cable popularized the celebrity-reality format. And gimmicky shows like ''Joe Millionaire'' and ''Temptation Island'' twisted the competition format in ways that made some viewers cringe.
 But the decade's hit reality shows -- ''Survivor,'' ''American Idol'' and ''Dancing With the Stars''-- share traits. They're easy to explain, have high production values and generally stay true to an original idea. ''Survivor,'' in particular, never strays far from the template the producers have painstakingly created. The host never changes. The time slot never changes. The tribal council never changes.
 WITHIN this template, the scenery and the contestants change every season. The locations dot the globe: Thailand, Micronesia, Panama, Fiji, China. But at its heart, ''Survivor'' is a show about characters, about heroes and villains, about loyalty and duplicity. 
 The contestant eliminations add an element of surprise that scripted shows can rarely match. ''In scripted TV, clearly the lead character is not going to die,'' Mr. Burnett said. ''In unscripted TV, oftentimes the favorite character gets voted out.''
 The most important aspect of ''Survivor's'' survival may be its mythology. Sitting in an office decorated by Emmy statues and a map of Pulau Tiga, where the first season was filmed, Mr. Burnett discussed the series' lasting appeal. Citing ''The Hero With a Thousand Faces,'' the mythological study by Joseph Campbell, he said ''Survivor'' adopted classic storytelling styles and devices that ''just work.''
 Mr. Burnett carefully constructed the tribal council sessions at the climax of each episode. They are always held after dark, alluding to sacrificial ceremonies. The contestants are illuminated by torchlight, instilling fear. By voting a member out, ''the tribes are executing one of their own,'' Mr. Burnett said.
 When the votes are counted, the torch of the excommunicated tribe member is snuffed out. Mr. Probst does not let the person say goodbye, continuing the allusion to death. But then he makes a reference to the day ahead, symbolizing rebirth and hope.
 ''I don't often think about this,'' Mr. Burnett said self-consciously. ''You may think this is completely nutty.''
 It's not. It is evidence that the show's storytelling style is layered and novelistic, complete with historical analogies, perhaps demonstrating why it has prospered. No one can say with a straight face that reality TV stunts like this season's ''Hole in the Wall'' (plot: try to contort your body into Tetris-like pieces or risk falling into a vat of yellow water) has mythological roots. 
 The most recent reality shows ''feel a little less sustainable and a little more quick-buck,'' Mr. Probst said.
 Consider ''Secret Talents of the Stars,'' a competition that CBS canceled the day after its premiere in April. Or ''America's Toughest Jobs,'' a summer series that turned into an occupational hazard for NBC when fewer than four million viewers were watching last month.
 The dearth of new hits puts more pressure on producers like Mr. Burnett, whose TV empire now extends far beyond ''Survivor,'' including ''Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?'' and ''The Apprentice.'' The morning he met with Mr. Probst and Mr. Kirhoffer, a binder labeled ''StarMaker,'' a planned MTV reality show about grooming musical talent, was on the table. 
 He has no doubt that reality will remain a TV staple, saying that a generation of teenagers has grown up with reality as a dominant format: ''They may not remember pre-reality TV.''
 REALITY shows are, stereotypically speaking, easy and inexpensive to produce. The budget for each hourlong episode of ''Survivor'' is about $2 million, about $1 million less than many scripted dramas. But unlike scripted shows, reality shows have limited rerun and syndication value. And ''Survivor'' is produced overseas, so it's susceptible to currency fluctuations. ''The value of the dollar is making our budgets shrink because it's worth less than it used to be,'' Mr. Probst said.
 When the series started in 2000, it posed little risk for CBS, because the company had signed up eight advertisers to sponsor it before it entered production. ''We needed a certain amount of advertising backing it up, so if the thing was a disaster we'd be covered,'' Mr. Moonves said. 
 ''Survivor'' integrated products like Dr. Scholl's foot-care items into the first season. While that type of product placement was novel then, it is widespread now, with cups of Coca-Cola on ''American Idol'' and Saturn cars on ''Project Runway.'' 
 CBS charges $213,000 for a 30-second commercial on ''Survivor'' this season, Advertising Age estimated this month, up slightly compared with last year. Only two other CBS shows earn more, the trade publication said, ''Two and a Half Men'' and ''CSI.''
 Mr. Burnett and Mr. Probst have committed to the 19th and 20th seasons, but CBS has ordered the series through only the 18th. Mr. Moonves said, however, that he expected to order more. ''It's not going away anytime soon,'' he said.
 CBS would be foolish to let ''Survivor'' retire, at least until it comes up with something that will deliver higher ratings in the time slot. That something could well be a new reality program.
 Forecasters have learned to be wary of betting against reality shows. By 2005, ''everyone had started saying 'reality's had it,' and then 'Dancing With the Stars' showed up,'' said Ms. Brill, from Carat. ''Dancing,'' on ABC, also has two seasons a year; it averages 18 million viewers a night. 
 ''Somebody, sooner or later'' will have another good idea, she said, ''and will launch a series that everybody will get excited about.''

HEADLINE: A Hemline Index, Updated

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
More suicides? Fewer male births? Less back pain? More laxative sales?
Data points litter the landscape as economists, sociologists, psychologists and marketers examine the societal changes, big and small, trivial and traumatic, that accompany a bad economy. And with this particular version of a troubled economy -- a stock market that goes into convulsions at 3 p.m., a looming global recession, a $700 billion bailout plan that may or may not work, and a jittery public wondering what is coming next -- changes should flow as freely as profits in good times.
It's one thing to measure changes in society, however, and another to ascribe causes. But if the causal link is elusive, you still might expect to see slack soda sales, more frequent car thefts and meaning-laden tunes at the top of the pop charts during a recession.
Terry F. Pettijohn II, a professor of psychology at Coastal Carolina University, is one of those who sees popular tastes shift with economic conditions. Take beauty, for example. ''What we find attractive is not a stable currency,'' said Mr. Pettijohn, who has studied how economic and social factors shape preferences in popular music, movie stars and Playboy models. ''It's affected by the environment, by what's happening in society, and what makes us feel more comfortable in threatening times.'' 
Looking at Billboard No. 1 songs from 1955 to 2003 for a study to be published in the journal Psychology of Music, he found that in uncertain times, people tend to prefer songs that are longer, slower, with more meaningful themes.
''It's 'Bridge Over Troubled Water,' and 'That's What Friends Are For,' '' he said. ''In better times, it's more likely to be faster, upbeat songs like 'At the Hop' or 'My Sharona.' ''
The correlation isn't perfect. The song Mr. Pettijohn's raters called most meaningless, ''Macarena,'' was a hit in a relatively bad year.
The Environmental Security Hypothesis that he and his colleagues have been testing, positing that people look for reassurance in worrying times, also helped explain why Playboy magazine's Playmate of the Year in bad times tended to have a more mature appearance -- that is, to be older, heavier, taller and less curvy -- than those selected when times were good. Similarly, in a study of American movie stars from 1932 to 1955, he found actresses with mature features -- small eyes, large chins, and thin faces -- more popular in hard times.
Buying patterns too, can be predicted in economic downturns, according to Leo J. Shapiro, who has tracked consumer behavior since he was a young man in the late 1930s.
''DURING a recession, laxatives go up, because people are under tremendous stress, and holding themselves back,'' said Mr. Shapiro, now chief executive of SAGE, a Chicago-based consulting firm. ''During a boom, deodorant sales go up, because people are out dancing around. When people have less money, they buy more of the things that have less water in them, things that are not so perishable. Instead of lettuce and steak and fruit, it's rice and beans and grain and pasta. Except this time the price of pasta's so high that it's beans and rice.''
A recent Nielsen report listed tobacco, carbonated drinks and eggs as especially vulnerable to recession, and candy, beer and pasta sauce as recession-proof. On Thursday, Hershey's announced third-quarter sales and income higher than last year's. (''We offer a tremendous variety of affordable indulgences, and people love chocolate, even in hard times,'' said Kirk Saville, a company spokesman.)
Almost anything can be an economic indicator. Back in the 1920s, the economist George Taylor conceived the hemline index, finding that skirts got longer as the economy slowed. These days, there's been talk of a haircut index, with short locks signaling a market drop.
The economic downturn could signal significant changes in American life.
''A stunning statistic is that unlike in past epochs, the higher up the income ladder you go, the more hours you work,'' said Dalton Conley, a sociology professor at New York University. ''More and more, things that used to be outside the marketplace are in the economy. Instead of mom or dad coming home with groceries, they go out, or order in.''
A downturn, then, could result in benefits unmeasured by the market. ''If people eat out less, the G.D.P. goes down,'' Mr. Conley said, ''but nothing in the G.D.P. captures what you gain if you cook and eat in a leisurely way with your kids.''
In a study of coffee growers in Colombia, Grant Miller, who teaches health policy at Stanford's medical school, found that infant and child mortality rates fell as coffee prices slumped, and concluded that it was because parents had more time to take care of their children.
By most accounts, bad times herald an upturn in at least some crime.
''I've never been able to find any relationship between violent crime and the economy,'' said Stephen Raphael, an economics professor in the School of Public Policy at the University of California at Berkeley who specializes in urban and labor economics. ''But there is a relationship with property crime. Whether it's burglary, larceny or motor vehicle theft, they all go up with unemployment.''
And already, the market drop has created many personal crises.
''We've never had this level of call volume'' said Dr. Richard A. Chaifetz, chief executive of ComPsych, the largest provider of employee assistance programs, covering 27 million people. ''It's been going up gradually all year, but then it spiked and we're up 20, 30 percent since late July. And where relationships and personal psychology issues used to the be the No. 1 reason people called, it's now financial and legal issues that are No. 1.''
In a typical downturn, young people flock to higher education, especially lower-cost alternatives like community colleges, state universities and trade schools, to bolster their employability. At the same time, parents and students nationwide are agonizing over choices between public schools and private schools and what loans they can afford or even qualify for.
And although Americans have a hard time paying their medical bills and preventive medical care takes a hit in a poor economy, some economists say that there are positive health effects.
''People are physically healthier in times of recession,'' said Christopher Ruhm, an economist at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. ''Death rates fall, people smoke less, drink less and exercise more. Traffic fatalities go way down, which is not a surprise when people drive less. Heart attacks go down. Back problems go down. People have more time to prepare healthier meals at home. When the economy weakens, pollution falls.''
This Panglossian view has its limits.
''People are healthier, but they're not happier,'' Mr. Ruhm said. ''Suicide rises, and mental health may deteriorate.''
Generally, though, poverty is associated with bad health. And since economic downturns have so many effects, it is often impossible to sort out what mechanism might be responsible for what health result.
Some economists are skeptical of Mr. Ruhm's findings.
''This is a very complicated area,'' said Ralph Catalano, a professor of public health at Berkeley. ''If you're looking at people anticipating economic adversity, worrying about losing their job, some of them will spend less money on alcohol, take fewer risks, do more things that are good for them. So, in some places, the net effect may be fewer people having acute traumatic illness. But if you look at the people who've actually lost a job, or lost a business, they are more likely to have adverse health outcomes. When you get to saying there must be fewer people driving, so there must be fewer traffic accidents and cleaner air, that's what I'd call econometric imagination.''
Mr. Catalano, who found in an earlier study, based on data from Germany, that a bad economy was linked with a decline in male births, cautioned against predicting how this recession would reshape society.
''What we don't know is what's going to happen next,'' he said. ''We don't know yet how anxious people are going to get, or how many people are going to lose their jobs. The experience we're going through is unprecedented. The last time we had this kind of experience was in the 1930s, and we didn't have data.''
Mr. Conley, too, harked back to the Great Depression in suggesting that the current downturn could lead to a more equal America, if the richest people suffer the greatest economic losses.
''Nineteen twenty-nine was the peak of inequality,'' he said. ''It's almost like things get too top-heavy, and they topple over.''

HEADLINE: The Great Iceland Meltdown

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: London 

 BODY:
 Who knew? Who knew that Iceland was just a hedge fund with glaciers? Who knew?
 If you're looking for a single example of how the globalization of finance helped get us into this mess and how it will help get us out, you need look no further than British newspapers last week and their front-page articles about the number of British citizens, municipalities and universities -- including Cambridge -- that are in a tizzy today because they had savings parked in Icelandic banks, through online banking services like Icesave.co.uk.
 As Dave Barry would say, I'm not makin' this up. 
 When I went to the Icesave Web site to see what it was all about, the headline read: ''Simple, transparent and consistently high-rate online savings accounts from Icesave.'' But then, underneath in blue letters, I found the following note appended: ''We are not currently processing any deposits or any withdrawal requests through our Icesave Internet accounts. We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause our customers.''
 Any ''inconvenience?'' When you can't withdraw savings from an online bank in Iceland, that is more than an inconvenience! That's a reason for total panic.
 So what's the story? Around 2002, Iceland began to free its banks from state ownership. According to The Wall Street Journal, the three banks that make up almost the entire banking system in Iceland ''grew quickly on easy credit'' and ''their combined assets rose tenfold in five years.'' The Icelandic banks, while not invested in U.S. subprime mortgages, had gone on their own borrowing and lending binges, wooing savers from across Europe with 5.45 percent interest savings accounts. 
 In a flat world, money can easily seek out the highest returns, and when word got around about Iceland, deposits poured in from Britain -- some $1.8 billion. Unfortunately, though, when global credit markets closed up, and the krona fell, ''the Icelandic banks were unable to finance their debts, many of which were denominated in foreign currencies,'' The Times reported. When depositors rushed to get their money out, the Icelandic banking system had too little reserves to cover withdrawals, so all three banks melted down and were nationalized. 
 It turns out that more than 120 British municipal governments, as well as universities, hospitals and charities had deposits stranded in blocked Icelandic bank accounts. Cambridge alone had about $20 million, while 15 British police forces -- from towns like Kent, Surrey, Sussex and Lancashire -- had roughly $170 million frozen in Iceland, The Telegraph reported. Even the bobbies were banking in Iceland!
 So think about it: Some mortgage broker in Los Angeles gives subprime ''liar loans'' to people who have no credit ratings so they can buy homes in Southern California. Those flimsy mortgages get globalized through the global banking system and, when they go sour, they eventually prompt banks to stop lending, fearful that every other bank's assets are toxic, too. The credit crunch hits Iceland, which went on its own binge. Meanwhile, the police department of Northumbria, England, had invested some of its extra cash in Iceland, and, now that those accounts are frozen, it may have to reduce street patrols this weekend.
 And therein lies the central truth of globalization today: We're all connected and nobody is in charge.
 Globalization giveth -- it was this democratization of finance that helped to power the global growth that lifted so many in India, China and Brazil out of poverty in recent decades. Globalization now taketh away -- it was this democratization of finance that enabled the U.S. to infect the rest of the world with its toxic mortgages. And now, we have to hope, that globalization will saveth.
 The real and sustained bailout from the crisis will happen when the strong companies buy the weak ones -- on a global basis. It's starting. Last week, Credit Suisse declined a Swiss government bailout and instead raised fresh capital from Qatar, the Olayan family of Saudi Arabia and Israel's Koor Industries. Japan's Mitsubishi bank bought a stake in Morgan Stanley, possibly rescuing it from bankruptcy and preventing an even steeper decline in the Dow. And Spain's Banco Santander, which was spared from the worst of this credit crisis by Spain's conservative banking regulations, is purchasing America's Sovereign Bankcorp. 
 I suspect we will soon see the same happening in industry. And, once the smoke clears, I suspect we will find ourselves living in a world of globalization on steroids -- a world in which key global economies are more intimately tied together than ever before. 
 It will be a world in which America will not be able to scratch its ear, let alone roll over in bed, without thinking about the impact on other countries and economies. And it will be a world in which multilateral diplomacy and regulation will no longer be a choice. It will be a reality and a necessity. We are all partners now.

HEADLINE: After W., Le Deluge

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
It is the best of times, it is the worst of times.
 The best of times because W.'s long Reign of Error is about to end.
 The worst of times because, well, you know why.
 In this season of darkness, as Charles Dickens described an earlier mob scene, I'm feeling as vengeful and bloodthirsty as Madame Defarge sharpening her knitting needles at the guillotine.
 I even felt a little thrill go up my leg, as Chris Matthews would put it, when I heard that the Lehman Brothers C.E.O., Richard Fuld, got punched in the company gym after it was announced that the firm was going under. 
 I can't wait to see the tumbrels rumble up and down Wall Street picking up the heedless and greedy financial aristocracy that plundered and sundered free-market capitalism.
 Just when we thought executives of A.I.G., the insurance giant bailed out by taxpayers for $123 billion, had been shamed into stopping their post-bailout Marie Antoinette spa treatments, luxury sports suites, Vegas and California posh resort retreats, we were dumbfounded to learn that some A.I.G. execs were cavorting at a lavish shooting party at a British country manor.
 London's News of the World sent undercover reporters to hunt down the feckless financiers on their $86,000 partridge hunt as they tromped through the countryside in tweed knickers, and then later as they ''slurped fine wine'' and feasted on pigeon breast and halibut.
 The paper reported that the A.I.G. revelers stayed at Plumber Manor -- not the ancestral home of Joe the Plumber, a 17th-century country house in Dorset -- and spent $17,500 for food and rooms. The private jet to get there cost another $17,500, and the limos added up to $8,000 more.
 In an astonishing let-them-eat-cake moment, the A.I.G. big shot Sebastian Preil held court at the bar and told an undercover reporter, ''The recession will go on until about 2011, but the shooting was great today and we are relaxing fine.''
 There were at least three New Yorkers bagging birds -- Jeffrey Malkovsky, a senior director at A.I.G.'s Manhattan office, Hilary James, the general manager of the Bristol Plaza Hotel, and her friend, John Roberts, an A.I.G. adviser.
 Who are these looters of our loot? The New York Times should follow up the excellent Portraits of Grief it did after 9/11 with Portraits of Greed.
 Payback doesn't have to go as far as the French Revolution. The grifters shafting us don't have to shed blood, but they do have to give the money back. As far as these self-serving corporate con men and short-selling traders are concerned, off with their headsets.
 John McCain wasted his last-chance debate Wednesday by trying to stir up faux class rage against Barack Obama with Joe the Unvetted Plumber instead of tapping into the real class rage the country feels over bailing out ungrateful financiers who gambled away the life savings of working people.
 'Tis a far, far better thing that New York's attorney general, Andrew Cuomo, did when he demanded that A.I.G.'s former executives who were trying to abscond with many millions in severance payments, bonuses and golden parachutes surrender the swag. He set a good example for the feds, who slapped Mr. Fuld in the face with a subpoena.
 Cuomo got A.I.G. to instantly reverse itself and cancel 160 conferences and other events that would have cost more than $8 million, as well as give up information on compensation, bonuses and other payments to determine whether they were fitting. (How could they be?)
 ''We stopped a $10 million severance payment to Stephen Bensinger, the chief financial officer,'' Cuomo told me Friday. ''Just look at the words chief financial officer. There's a phenomenon when senior management sees the corporation deteriorating and they concoct a version of looting the company to take care of themselves.''
 Even Cuomo, who has been locked in battle with A.I.G. for a long time, was stunned when he learned of the British hunting folly. At first he thought it could not be true.
 ''That was our partridge hunting trip,'' he said. ''The partridge paid the ultimate price, but the taxpayer came close.''
 He is using a state ''claw back'' law, which he says allows him to recover contracts and rescind payments if there was unjust compensation.
 Great. Now can he find the $123 billion lost by A.I.G. that we now have to plug with taxpayers' money?
 Let's hope that if Barack Obama becomes president, the first thing he does is keep his promise to make the junketeers come to Washington (preferably by bus or carpooling) and write the U.S. Treasury a check, after which he will fire them on the spot.
 Heads must roll.

HEADLINE: The Downturn's Upside

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
Your retirement savings are swirling through the drain of the market meltdown, your home isn't worth what a Chihuahua's doghouse was a year ago, and the United States may be facing the most severe recession since the Great Depression. 
 But cheer up, for this is a happy column! The economic misery is numbingly real, but it's also true that a downturn isn't uniformly bad and might even be good for you in several ways: 
 A recession could save your life. Christopher Ruhm, an economist at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro, argues that death rates go down during economic slowdowns. Professor Ruhm's research indicates that suicides rise but total mortality rates drop, as do deaths from heart attacks, car accidents, pneumonia and most other causes.
 For example, each one-percentage-point drop in unemployment in the United States is associated with an extra 3,900 deaths from heart attacks. 
 Some experts are skeptical. But in downturns we drive less and so car accidents decline, while less business activity means fewer job accidents and less pollution. Moreover, in recessions people have more leisure time and seem to smoke less, exercise more and eat more healthily.
 A bear market might benefit you, if you are in your working years and won't have to sell your stocks soon. That's because you're probably accumulating stocks now in your retirement account, and you'll accumulate more when share prices are low.
 Americans are twice as likely to own a retirement account, like a 401(k) or an I.R.A., as to own a stock portfolio outright. For anyone a decade or more from retirement, a bear market is a chance to pick up bargains.
 For such people, today's bear market probably won't affect share prices when you have to sell. I hit age 70 in 2029, and I doubt that the market level then will be affected by today's turmoil.
 (This is the view of the ''revert to the mean'' school of financial economists, who see share prices eventually returning to long-term trends. Conversely, some economists in the ''random walk'' school think prices won't necessarily ever catch up. In the absence of firm evidence about who is right, you may as well side with the former; you'll feel better as you survey the wreckage of your 401(k).)
 Falling housing prices harm landlords and speculators but benefit renters and first-time buyers (if they can still get mortgages). These beneficiaries tend to be low-income families, thus in this respect the poor may benefit. Likewise, a recession lowers prices of gas, oil and food, which disproportionately affect the poor. 
 More broadly, there's some evidence that falling home and stock prices will raise savings rates in the United States. That is necessary for the long-term health of the economy.
 Income doesn't have much to do with happiness. Americans haven't become any happier as they have prospered in the last half-century. And winning the lottery doesn't make people happier in the long term.
 This is called the Easterlin Paradox: Once they have met their basic needs, people don't become happier as they become richer. In recent years, new research has undermined the Easterlin Paradox, yet it's still true that happiness has less to do with money than with friendships and finding meaning in a cause larger than oneself. 
 ''There's pretty good evidence that money doesn't matter much for how you feel moment to moment,'' said Alan Krueger, a Princeton University economist who is conducting extensive research on happiness. ''What seems to matter much more is having good friends and family, and time to spend on social activities.''
 The big exception to all this is people who lose their jobs or homes, and the new president should act immediately to help them. Professor Krueger argues that for these people, the losses are greater than we have generally realized, for their losses are not only monetary but also the erosion of self-esteem and friendships as they are wrenched out of social networks that enrich their lives (and help them find new jobs). And for those who lose health insurance, a medical or dental problem is enormously stressful, even life-threatening.
 One lesson is that the government should try particularly hard to keep people in their homes. We should, for example, allow courts to ease the terms of mortgages to prevent foreclosures, while also boosting assistance to help the unemployed find jobs. 
 Obviously, a meltdown isn't good. Divorce rates spike in recessions. Credit evaporates, lives are upended, and for retirees counting on selling stocks to survive, a bear market is a catastrophe. 
 Yet that's not the whole picture, and we shouldn't overdo the gloom the way we overdid the giddiness during the boom. For most Americans, those who keep their homes and jobs and are years from retirement, even the most bearish cloud might have a silver lining.

HEADLINE: Life After The Bubble: How Japan Lost a Decade

BYLINE: By JIM IMPOCO. 
Jim Impoco is the executive editor of Men's Journal and a former Sunday business editor of The New York Times; he covered the rise and fall of the Japanese bubble economy as a foreign correspondent for U.S. News & World Report.

 BODY:
Is America the new Japan? Or more precisely, Japan circa 1990, just as it was staggering into its Lost Decade. As recently as six months ago, the notion that the United States would face a decade or more of Japanese-style economic malaise seemed preposterous. But after the last few weeks of financial turmoil and political ineptitude, you could almost argue that America would be fortunate to end up with a downturn akin to Japan's. That's because in several key ways, Japan was much better equipped to withstand its financial lashing in the 1990s than Americans are today. 
 A little history: During the post-World-War-II era, the Japanese economy often lived up to its Homeric epithet: the Miracle Economy. It rose from the ruins of the war to become the world's second-largest economy. By the mid-1980s, America and Japan accounted for a staggering 40 percent of the global economy. Picture Ronald Reagan and Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone belting out ''We Are the World'' in some fancy karaoke bar in the Ginza. 
 Then, in 1986, Japan shifted into overdrive. It was a time of super-easy credit, frenzied financial speculation, and blistering industrial expansion. During the second half of the 1980s, the Tokyo Stock Exchange's compass seemed permanently stuck on north. Between 1986 and 1991, Japan had expanded by roughly the equivalent of France's gross domestic product, then $956 billion. Japan was also outshining the United States, whose consumers bought most of its products and whose military provided its protection. In fact, its rise seemed to coincide with America's slide.
 The United States appeared to be a spent power, done in by imperial overreach, as Paul Kennedy put it. Anything we could do, Japan could do better. We made Pintos; they made Accords. We made ''Ishtar''; they made Walkmans. But mostly we made things like greenmail and leveraged buyouts and they made, well, a lot of stuff -- widgets the world loved. 
 But Japan was also busy manufacturing a second bubble of comical proportions. Its real estate market made our recent mania seem downright restrained by comparison. At the start of the 90s, a square meter of prime Ginza real estate cost as much as $300,000. Homes were so expensive in land-scarce Japan that families took out multigenerational loans.
 My favorite example of how real estate had become an extreme sport: the property that housed the Imperial Palace in downtown Tokyo was believed to be worth (no one knew for sure because it wasn't really for sale) as much as the entire state of California. 
 Then the double bubble turned into double trouble when both burst at the same time. Denial followed denial. When officials did finally admit there was a problem, policy misstep followed misstep as Japan's clever, selfless and indefatigable mandarins (our best and brightest went to Wall Street; theirs went to the Ministry of Finance) started acting like fumbling Soviet bureaucrats, minus the corruption. Experts on Japan, watching Tokyo's initial nonresponse to the crisis, smirked that Americans facing a similar mess would have rolled up their sleeves and busted a few heads. Just look at how we had handled our savings and loan debacle. 
 What came next for Japan was depressing but far from a depression. There were no miso soup lines and the relatively low official unemployment rate often seemed to belie that there was a problem at all. But Japan seemed out of miracles. The economy would grow a little, then stop, then contract a little. Countless bridges to nowhere were built, but all the spending on infrastructure failed to lift the nation out of its doldrums. 
 The notion of Japan as a threat, a ninja-like adversary along the lines that Michael Crichton described in ''Rising Sun,'' suddenly seemed silly. No one worries much about Japan taking over the world today. When we wring our hands, it's China we fear. 
 Now that the United States' second bubble has popped, some Americans worry that this is the beginning of their own Lost Decade. There is still good reason to think that America's policy response will not be -- and cannot be -- denial. 
 Still, America lacks several advantages Japan had as it grappled with the aftermath of its burst bubbles. The most obvious one is that Japan began its Lost Decade as the world's largest creditor nation, and it still is. By contrast, America is now, as it was then, the world's biggest debtor nation. Just to make the United States government run we need to borrow $2 billion a day from increasingly nervous lenders overseas, including the Japanese. 
 For the moment, it is in the best interest of America's creditors to keep the spigot open, but when and if that changes, watch out. Some estimates have the federal deficit weighing in at over $750 billion next year. 
 That's not the biggest ever as a percentage of total economic output, but it's up there; and it's not clear how that number is going to get smaller any time soon. What's more, whereas America has a negative savings rate and its citizens are neck-deep in debt, the Japanese have remained fanatical savers, frugal to a fault.
 That's why when people ask me now if we are turning Japanese, I no longer tell them: ''No Way!'' Now I tell them: ''If we are lucky.''

HEADLINE: Mixing Money and Family

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
AS some New Yorkers try to take advantage of a slowing real estate market, they're seeking loans from lenders whom they haven't borrowed from in years: their parents and other relatives. These buyers aren't people who lean on rich relatives every time they need cash; in fact, most of them said they had never asked for help in their adult lives. 
 But banks have tightened lending standards so much that if the would-be buyers don't ask for help, they will either have no chance to buy, or stand to lose down payments already made or mortgages already negotiated. 
 Financial advisers say they are fielding many more calls than usual from clients asking which investments to tap into to help their sons and daughters and what the tax implications will be. Mortgage brokers, too, are spending hours talking to their clients' relatives about lending money and becoming guarantors. 
 ''It's happening more and more often, especially because banks have tightened their restrictions,'' said Ross Weinstein, a managing partner of the Union Square Mortgage Group. 
 Right now, Mr. Weinstein said, he is advising five clients who are in contract to buy apartments with help from families, and he says half of his upcoming deals involve buyers getting money from relatives. ''The only people they can turn to is their family,'' he said.
 Christian Wagner, 33, and Kristen Grossholtz, 35, asked their parents for help last summer. The couple had saved about $100,000 and started shopping for co-ops that cost less than $500,000. 
 With help from their broker, Debby Klein of Bellmarc Realty, they found a $380,000 one-bedroom co-op at 1270 Fifth Avenue, at 108th Street, that needed about $60,000 in renovations. They felt they had found a bargain that would survive a more troubled market, because comparable renovated units had sold for about $500,000. Mr. Wagner also decided to do some of the renovations himself to trim costs.
 But they used up their savings, putting them toward closing costs and the co-op's required 20 percent down payment. They asked their parents to give them a total of $60,000, to meet the co-op's requirement for the equivalent of two years in mortgage and maintenance payments. They closed on July 31, and are using the remaining money toward renovations and their small wedding in Hawaii.
 Mr. Wagner's parents are not wealthy, but they said they wanted to help. His father, Stephen Wagner, a retired carpenter and building inspector who lives in Apple Valley, Calif., is quick to acknowledge that he's a ''worrywart'' about the state of the economy. But Mr. Wagner said his own parents had helped him and his wife, Virginia, who runs a preschool, in buying their home 30 years ago. They want to do the same.
 ''Everything is kind of a gamble,'' Mr. Wagner said. ''Life is short. We had two boys, and our other son died two years ago. You just try to help people when you can.''
 While the money was given to the couple as a gift, and confirmed as a gift in letters submitted to the co-op board, Christian said he hoped to repay his parents one day. 
 Typically, a relative can give up to $12,000 each year to a family member without paying taxes on the gift.
 The help from family members is taking many forms. Some people offer to pay debts like car loans to improve their children's credit scores. Others place money -- up to hundreds of thousands of dollars in some cases -- in relatives' bank accounts so that they can meet co-ops' new, stricter requirements for post-closing reserves. Co-ops often ask families to document that this money is a gift and not a loan. 
 Some buyers don't actually need cash, but they have asked financially stable relatives to act as guarantors, agreeing to make payments on the mortgage if the buyers default. 
 Stefani Pace, an associate broker at Prudential Douglas Elliman, is representing two different buyers who work in the banking industry and who, based on their salaries, could easily afford the apartments they are trying to buy. But they asked their parents to be guarantors to satisfy the demands of their co-op boards. 
 These loans and monetary gifts are alarming some financial planners, who fear that the givers are jeopardizing their own long-term financial security. 
 David Bendix, the founder of the Bendix Financial Group in Garden City, N.Y., said that in the last two months, he had fielded nearly double the usual number of calls from clients who wanted to know what investments to cash out of to help relatives, often to buy real estate. If a client had large cash savings, he said, he would be more likely to advise making a loan. But it would be another matter if a client needed to sell stocks. ''To ask someone to get out of the equity market or borrow against their retirement plans is not realistic or practical,'' he said. 
 In all cases, he urges his clients to get agreements in writing. At the very least, he encourages them to draft a one-page document that lists the terms of the loan, with details like whether it's interest-free or whether it will be repaid once the property is sold. He suggests getting it signed by both parties and notarized. Ideally, he says, the document should be reviewed by lawyers representing both sides. 
 Some buyers who sought help have had second thoughts since the financial sector came crashing down. Jeff Goodman, an agent for Barak Realty, is representing a couple expecting their first child. They saved $50,000 and planned to ask their family for $20,000 to help buy a $500,000 two-bedroom in the Manhattan neighborhood of Hamilton Heights. But the couple's relatives are small-business owners who could be hurt by the economic slowdown. So instead of borrowing the money, they decided to buy a $380,000 apartment in Inwood on their own. 
 Others say they are providing a safer investment for their family members' money. Alicia Gunderman and Michael Accardi, both 26, bought a $265,000 three-bedroom co-op in Hartsdale, in Westchester. After the couple had been approved for a mortgage by one bank and cleared by the co-op board, the bank canceled the loan. 
 Ms. Gunderman said she was told it was because their credit scores weren't in the 700s and they would have only about $20,000 for post-closing reserves, which is less than what the bank wanted. The couple then tried and failed to get a mortgage through a second bank. They realized that if they didn't find more cash to satisfy the bank, they might lose their $26,500 down payment.
 So they asked four relatives and one friend for help in raising a total of $13,500, to put down an additional 5 percent of the purchase price, and an extra $5,000 each, to show the bank they had sufficient funds for closing costs. They promised to repay some of the money once they closed. 
 Mr. Accardi, who says he has worked since he was 11, found the process of seeking help painful. ''It felt awful,'' he said. ''I had to humble myself.''
 Once the couple presented their case, the relatives all agreed to help. Some family members gave money as outright gifts, while others asked to be repaid with interest. Ms. Gunderman, who works in new development for Warburg Realty, argued that lending to them offered their relatives better returns than investing in stocks. To make that case, she showed them that a similar apartment in the same building was selling for $299,000. 
 They closed on Sept. 29, and they have worked out the terms of repayment with those relatives. 
 In some cases, the mere mention of borrowing money can drive a wedge between family members. Mr. Weinstein said he spent the last two months advising a couple who had negotiated a two-bedroom condominium in East Williamsburg down to $520,000 from $590,000. They had saved about $50,000and decided to ask each of their families for $50,000. That way, they could put down $125,000, pay $25,000 toward closing costs and qualify for a $395,000 mortgage at a more competitive interest rate.
 At first the families agreed to give the money as gifts. They gave their children about $20,000 each and agreed to pay the rest at closing. One side of the family took money from a savings account; the other sold stocks for the down payment and planned to mortgage a home for the remaining amount. Mr. Weinstein said he spent more than 10 hours on the phone with relatives reviewing the terms of the deal. 
 But two weeks after the couple went to contract, both families changed their minds and advised their children to pull out. They did so earlier this month, and are trying to get their down payment returned.
 Mr. Weinstein says the experience of working with families on financing is more of a drain than dealing with any bank. ''Banks don't have a lot of emotion,'' he said. ''Adding the family members into the mix, well now you've got everything that a bank would do, plus emotions.''
 Sometimes, relatives will help once they have done some research. 
 Courtney Fransen, 32, is waiting to close on a studio at the Olive Park condo at 100 Maspeth Avenue in East Williamsburg, Brooklyn. She had saved about $35,000 to put toward a down payment and closing costs. She negotiated the price to $350,000 from $380,000. But although she makes enough money as a television producer to cover mortgage payments, her status as a freelancer made it difficult for her to qualify for a mortgage. She also didn't have enough cash to close. ''It made it beyond my reach to do it alone because there was nothing left over for closing costs,'' Ms. Fransen said.
 So she asked her parents, Barbara and Carl, for help. They visited the neighborhood three times, met the condo's construction supervisor and walked around the nearby Cooper Park to make sure the area felt safe. 
 They asked her what she would do if she lost her job. She found that apartments similar to hers rented for about $2,000 a month. If she lost her job, she reasoned, she would rent her studio to cover her mortgage and move into a cheaper rental with roommates. After that, her parents lent her about $24,000 for the down payment from money they had in savings. Then her mother agreed to add her name on the mortgage as a co-applicant. That meant Barbara Fransen had to go through the same approval process as her daughter, providing her own information about income or assets. She would also be held responsible for the loan if Courtney missed any payments.
 Mr. Fransen said that they would figure out the details of Courtney's repayment later. The couple have helped two of her brothers buy homes in the last decade, and both purchases have appreciated. In a more bearish market, they are realistic about the likelihood that this property may not grow in value as quickly.
 ''We feel that eventually when she does sell, the market will have come back and we will take our share of the proceeds,'' he said.
 Sometimes, relatives put family ahead of their anxiety about the market. 
 Marilyn Calister, a certified public accountant, originally offered to help her niece, Kirsten Calister-Kuhi, buy a $252,000 studio at 321 East 54th Street. Her agent, Shannon Aalai of Citi Habitats, handled the sale. Ms. Calister had offered to provide the down payment while Ms. Calister-Kuhi would handle the monthly payments.
 But the recent declines in the stock market made Ms. Calister consider pulling out of the deal. She moved forward because she wanted her niece to have a safe place to live and didn't want to let her down. She also spent hours reviewing the deal with her niece and her niece's boyfriend, Chad Coronato, who will live there.
 While she did not draft a formal contract with her niece, she put the agreement in e-mail messages. She is confident that she can count on her niece.
 ''This is a kid that I held the day she was born,'' Ms. Calister said. ''She will not let me down.''

To the Editor:
 Re ''The Rise of the Machines,'' by Richard Dooling (Op-Ed, Oct. 12):
 It's true that computer models have tied a financial knot too complex for human understanding. Nevertheless, the financial crisis could have been prevented by regulations to limit leverage and to require transparency in the derivatives market. But now a much larger crisis looms later in the 21st century: the machines that are far smarter than humans.
 But we need not despair if we turn to well-thought-out regulation and international coordination. The thoughts of such machines may be beyond our understanding, but we can require that they all be designed with benign motives. 
 Bill Hibbard New York, Oct. 12, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The financial industry's quant formulas are not beyond the layman's understanding. 
 ''Derivatives'' may sound familiar from high school calculus; they are functions whose value is derived from the value of another, known function. In the present crisis, our error was in trusting Richard Dooling's ''geeks'' to provide the machines with accurate functions.
 The math wizards who built these models used overly optimistic theories about real-life situations -- few foresaw stagnation in wages leading to high rates of foreclosure -- to produce hypotheses, and then put real money into flawed models. Certainly the value of a derivative is positive when it depends on the assumption that ballooning adjustable-rate mortgages will continue to be paid, but what if borrowers default en masse?
 We can't afford to forget that math is a science, bounded by the same empirical rules as any other.
 Michael Niland Boulder, Colo., Oct. 12, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Richard Dooling suggests that we now have financial instruments that only computers can fathom, thereby disempowering, and even enslaving, their erstwhile human masters. 
 Mr. Dooling cites Dr. Freeman J. Dyson, the physicist, who has described his infatuation with the ''seductive power'' of ''technical arrogance,'' and then asks: ''Are we living in a bad sci-fi movie? Is the Matrix made of credit default swaps?'' 
 There is, of course, an alternative view: Dr. Dyson's Los Alamos colleague, Richard P. Feynman, who famously said (and demonstrated through a number of brilliant, conceptually transparent books and lectures) that even the most abstruse concept should be explainable to anyone of normal intelligence using simple words, and props found around the home.
 Caveat emptor.
 David Sadkin Bradenton, Fla., Oct. 12, 2008
 To the Editor:
 In noting that very, very complex financial transactions underlie the subprime mortgage mess, Richard Dooling repeats something that is true, but not important.
 The technical complexity of these transactions is not relevant to a broad understanding of the financial crisis, which can be explained, I believe, in a very simple way: imprudent behavior on the part of supposedly sound financial institutions.
 These firms did not do this because they did not understand the risks of complex financial instruments; they did this because they were, while the party lasted, making enormous sums of money. 
 As usual, it is something simple -- greed -- that best explains why people do what they do.
 Ezra S. Abrams Newton, Mass., Oct. 12, 2008
 To the Editor:
 Richard Dooling explains the dangers of computer-driven financial instruments, but I must protest his alarmist projection of ''the havoc we can wreak by off-loading our minds onto super-intelligent machines.'' We do not off-load our minds onto the machines -- but off-load only certain reasoning processes, like algorithms. 
 Only a human could decide, like Warren Buffett, that these instruments are so complicated that I'm not going to trade them.
 Bob Lucas Oakland, Calif., Oct. 12, 2008
 To the Editor:
 The truth is that computers are created by humans. They are not superintelligent. Even on Wall Street, they merely count very fast at the behest of their human masters, and only fools or idolators imagine they are wise.
 You don't have to be a rocket scientist to look at the world around you and conclude that natural stupidity trumps artificial intelligence any time.
 Emanuel Derman New York, Oct. 12, 2008

TRIED BY WAR
 Abraham Lincoln as Commander in Chief
 By James M. McPherson
 Illustrated. 329 pp. The Penguin Press. $35
 James M. McPherson's ''Tried by War'' is a perfect primer, not just for Civil War buffs or fans of Abraham Lincoln, but for anyone who wishes to understand the evolution of the president's role as commander in chief. Few historians write as well as McPherson, and none evoke the sound of battle with greater clarity. There is scarcely anyone writing today who mines original sources more diligently. In ''Tried by War,'' McPherson draws on almost 50 years of research to present a cogent and concise narrative of how Lincoln, working against enormous odds, saved the United States of America. 
 This is not a book about White House table talk, the president's spiritual values, his relations with Mary Todd or even his deep-seated opposition to slavery. It is about how Lincoln led the nation to victory: his formulation of the country's war aims; his mobilization of public opinion; his diplomatic and economic leadership. Above all it is about his oversight of military strategy, in short, his duties as wartime commander in chief -- duties that Lincoln defined and executed for the first time in the nation's history. A peacetime president is circumscribed by elaborate checks and balances. In the full flush of war, Lincoln learned to act unilaterally. 
 McPherson, the George Henry Davis '86 emeritus professor of history at Princeton, handles the issue of secession adroitly. This was not a war between the states, much less between sovereign countries. It was a war of treason and rebellion. The Constitution reflected the work of the people, not the states, and the people had made it supreme. 
 Consequently, although the states of the Confederacy were temporarily under the control of rebel governments, they remained part of the Union. Lincoln was merely exercising his constitutional responsibility to take care that the laws of the United States were faithfully enforced -- not only in New York and New Jersey, but in Virginia and South Carolina as well. 
 Lincoln's oversight of military strategy consumes most of the book. When Gen. P. G. T. de Beauregard fired on Fort Sumter in April 1861, Lincoln was as green as any recruit. The United States regular Army numbered only 16,000 men, and a third of the officer corps, including a disproportionate number of high-ranking officers, were from the South. Lincoln was not necessarily left with the dregs of the service, but he had to fashion an army almost from scratch. 
 Initially, he deferred to Gen. Winfield Scott and the military professionals. As McPherson points out, Lincoln ''was not a quick study but a thorough one.'' And as it became apparent that the Army's senior leadership had neither the will nor the talent to suppress the rebellion, Lincoln took a more active role. 
 Forced to raise an army of volunteers, Lincoln appointed political figures to high command. Some, like John Logan of Illinois and Daniel Sickles of New York, proved outstanding combat commanders. Others, like Nathaniel P. Banks, Benjamin Butler and Lew Wallace, proved adequate. And a few, John C. Fremont, for example, brought more problems than they solved. 
 But the political officers were no worse than the West Point professionals. Scott, who had forced the Cherokees from Georgia and captured Mexico City during the Mexican War, was well over the hill and soon retired. George B. McClellan and Don Carlos Buell proved to be disasters; not only did both have the ''slows,'' as Lincoln phrased it; they had no interest in destroying the Confederate Army. Likewise, William S. Rosecrans, John Pope, Ambrose E. Burnside, Joseph Hooker and Henry W. Halleck, though eager to defeat the Confederacy, were risk-averse. As a result, Lincoln, in the first years of the war, often had to act as his own general in chief. 
 The security of the capital in Washington, the necessity of maintaining Missouri and Kentucky in the Union and the need to preserve public support in the face of military reverses kept Lincoln fully occupied. McPherson devotes well over half his book to the first two years of the war, because that is when Lincoln's leadership came most directly into play. 
 Not until the president discovered Ulysses S. Grant, and not until Grant came to Washington as general in chief in early 1864, did Lincoln have a leader ready to end the rebellion by destroying the Confederacy's ability to resist. ''Lee's army will be your objective point,'' Grant told George G. Meade in April 1864. ''Wherever Lee goes, there you will go also.'' With Grant in command, Lincoln could relax his control of military strategy. Grant had no appetite for occupying enemy territory or capturing railroad junctions, but he was absolutely determined to destroy the enemy army, and the generals he promoted -- William Tecumseh Sherman, Philip H. Sheridan and George H. Thomas -- shared that view. 
 Thanks to Grant (who had Robert E. Lee pinned to the wall at Petersburg), Sherman (who captured Atlanta) and Sheridan (who defeated Jubal Early in the Shenandoah Valley), the Union's fortunes turned. If the Confederacy had the advantage of interior lines of communication, the United States had the advantage of timeliness. It could determine the time and place of engagement, and by attacking at several points simultaneously, could nullify the South's ability to transfer troops from one theater to another. Under Grant's direction, no Southern army was able to reinforce another. In 1864 Lincoln was overwhelmingly re-elected to the White House, and a separate peace with the Confederacy that would have preserved slavery was avoided. 
 McPherson's treatment of the last stages of the war moves at a breathtaking pace: Thomas's rout of the Army of Tennessee at Nashville; Sherman's march to the sea; the capture of Savannah; and the destruction of the Deep South's will to resist. ''Grant has the bear by the hind leg,'' Lincoln told a visitor to the White House in early 1865, ''while Sherman takes off the hide.'' 
 The final blow was delivered against Lee's Army of Northern Virginia. Richmond and Petersburg were evacuated on April 2. Two days later Lincoln walked the streets of the former Confederate capital with an escort of just 10 sailors, while thousands of former slaves ''crowded to see the Moses they believed had led them to freedom.'' A week later at Appomattox the rebel army turned in its weapons and went home. 
 ''Tried by War'' reminds us of how great a crisis the United States faced when the governments of 11 Southern states attempted to secede in 1861 -- and how one man, Abraham Lincoln, stood in the way. It was his wise use of the war powers, as McPherson so ably demonstrates, that preserved the Union.

HEADLINE: Europe Returning to Land of In-Reach

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
FOR travelers who have been putting off that European vacation because they don't want to pay $400 a night for mediocre hotels or $6 for a can of Coke, relief is in sight.
 The economic turmoil in the United States has spread to Europe, and the financial jitters are beginning to affect the travel market. Airlines are rolling out deals on trans-Atlantic flights -- especially for those cushy seats at the front of the plane. Hotels are beginning to offer sales. And rather than jack up their rates from the year before, as has been the trend in recent years, many travel companies are holding prices steady or taking them down a notch.
 While autumn typically brings lower prices, part of the price drop can be attributed to declines in demand as consumers seem to be cutting back on their travel budgets. 
 But another reason is the rising dollar. ''Your dollar goes farther in Europe today than it did in the summer,'' said Tim Quinlan, an economic analyst at Wachovia. Since July, the dollar has firmed about 14 percent against the euro, to $1.39, and 11 percent versus the pound, to $1.78, bolstering Americans' buying power in Europe. 
 A stay at Scotland's Gleneagles resort, for example, would have cost a minimum of $770 a night in July when the exchange rate was $2 to the pound and rates began at $:385 a night. This month, the same room is about $85 cheaper.
 The Icelandic krona lost nearly half its value against the dollar in the last year, making this historically expensive country an increasingly affordable getaway for Americans. A hot dog in downtown Reykjavik (210 krona) was about $2 at 105 krona to the dollar in early October versus $3.50 last year. A one-day trip with Reykjavik Excursions to Snaefellsjokull glacier, at 11,500 krona was about $110, down from $192 a year ago. Hotels that were prohibitively expensive have become more reasonable. Rates at the popular 101 Hotel in downtown Reykjavik start at 41,900 krona or roughly $400, down from nearly $700 last year.
 While not exactly bargain basement, the combination of a strengthening dollar and softening demand means Europe is more affordable for Americans than it has been for quite a while. 
 Airlines are introducing sales in bursts. Earlier this month, Eurofly, an Italian carrier, offered a five-day sale with fares as low as $679 for one traveler and a companion to fly round trip to Rome this fall. Icelandair recently advertised fall fares from Boston to Europe starting at $478 round trip. Last week it was offering winter airfare specials as low as $400 round trip to Reykjavik from New York or Boston. And Delta recently advertised flights as low as $518 round trip from New York to Dublin and $558 to Amsterdam, Barcelona or Madrid. (These Delta fares do not include taxes and fees, which can range from $90 to $150 a person.)
 Don't wait if you want to nab a deal. Airlines are being very careful not to start a fare war, said Joe Brancatelli, publisher of Joesentme.com, a subscription travel site. ''The deals are very tactical -- book now, do it fast,'' he said. 
 Jetting around Europe is getting less expensive, too. Ryanair, the low-cost Irish carrier, said its average fare in October is 41 euros, down from 46 last year. Just last week the airline offered a million ''free'' seats in a three-day sale, enabling travelers to fly round trip from London to Dublin for as little as $:33, including taxes and fees. 
 But the best bargains are actually at the front of the plane. Aer Lingus, which can charge as much as $5,365 for a so-called walk-up business-class seat from New York to Shannon, recently introduced special holiday fares starting at $1,430 for business-class seats to Dublin or Shannon from Boston, New York or Washington. The special fares require 30-day advance purchase; are only good for travel over Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's; and are only available through Aer Lingus reservations at (800) 474-7424. American Airlines has been offering a free companion ticket to customers booking a round-trip business-class ticket to Britain -- a route where walk-up fares can be close to $10,000.
 The deals are ''much better than last year,'' Mr. Brancatelli said. ''They seem to be coming more frequently, more broadly and more dramatically than any year I've seen.''
 Some of the better hotel and cruise deals are also at the high end. ''What is especially interesting as it relates to the economy is that the luxury hotel market -- your 4 and 5 star hotels -- has strategically brought its rates significantly down,'' Gabe Saglie, senior editor at Travelzoo.com, wrote in an e-mail message. ''And in some cases, high-end hotel experiences in major cities are far more affordable than many U.S. tourists might think.'' 
 For example, the high-end Jumeirah Lowndes hotel in London recently offered a special deal on Travelzoo that cut rates from about $500, to $295 a night. While that deal expired, the May Fair, a Radisson Edwardian hotel in London, is offering 15 percent off its best weekend rates when a guest stays three nights or more. And La Residencia, an Orient-Express Hotel in Mallorca, Spain, is offering one free night to guests who book five or more nights in October, November or December. The deal, which includes buffet breakfast, starts at 280 euros. 
 There is also a new wave of European hotels designed with price-sensitive travelers in mind. The budget chain easyHotel, which offers tiny rooms for as little as $:25 a night, has had a boost as consumers turn to low-price accommodations. Occupancy rates for its London hotels for July and August increased to 95 percent from 73 percent in 2007, according to the company. 
 Don't forget about package deals that bundle airfare, hotel and car rentals into one low-price. They offer some of the best bargains at the moment. Travelocity.com has been listing hotel and flight packages with savings of as much as 30 percent, according to Travelzoo. Isle Inn Tours is offering a six-night Ireland fall package for $899, including a rental car and airfare from New York, Orlando or Washington. That's $150 less than a similar 2007 offer.
 European cruise prices are also dropping. Earlier this month, Orient Lines, a luxury cruise operator, reduced its 2009 prices for European cruises as much as $5,500 a couple. Under the new rate structure, a 15-night April Mediterranean cruise is priced from $6,499 a person based on double occupancy, down from $8,999. And some 11-night Mediterranean cruises are now $1,799 a person. 
 More deals are on the horizon: ''2009 is not going to be pretty,'' said James Chappell, managing director at STR Global, a hospitality research firm. ''When things happen in the marketplace, there obviously is a lag time as people respond to what is going on.''

 WALKING THROUGH THE LORRAINE AMERICAN CEMETERY AND MEMORIAL, NEAR ST.-AVOLD, FRANCE, Aug. 17, 2008: Bruce Lowry, 56, a tax attorney from Seattle, with his wife, Kathy, a retired economics professor. ''I was there on business. We had been the day before at Metz, and we were just driving to Luxembourg and it was time for lunch so we pulled over. On the way in to this little French town called St.-Avold, we saw a sign that said 'American cemetery.' We stopped in on a whim, and it turns out there are more Americans buried there from the Second World War than any other place in Europe. It was a beautiful day, and as we walked out of the chapel toward the cemetery, there's a clock, and it chimed 2. Neither of us had lost relatives in the war, but the place was just so quiet, and when that clock chimed, you couldn't help but think that all these young people -- even now I get choked up a bit -- time stopped for them at that point. It was very peaceful, and this clear chiming of the clock was very appropriate somehow. We were looking out over this sea of crosses, and it was just really quite overwhelming.'' As told to J. R.

HEADLINE: Dealing With the Stars

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL

 BODY:
WAY back when the New York real estate market was strong, a few short months ago, there was a belief in -- or at least a fervent hope for -- the celebrity premium, the idea that an association between an apartment and a legendary, admired, notorious or simply marketable person, could lead otherwise rational buyers to pay far more per square foot for a property. 
 Now, as the economy stalls, that notion appears to have taken a bullet. Last year, after a renovation and redesign believed to have cost more than $1 million over 18 months, Lenny Kravitz, the singer and songwriter, put his large duplex at 30 Crosby Street in SoHo back on the market. 
 After opening up the layout, and adding chocolate-brown walls and idiosyncratic design details, Mr. Kravitz listed the place at $19.5 million, far more than he had listed it for intermittently several years before. (When not on the market, it was rented out to Nicole Kidman and, later, Denzel Washington.) Mr. Kravitz paid about $7.1 million for the apartment eight years ago. 
 In early October, as the stock market plummeted, he cut his price by $750,000, to $18.75 million, at a still pricey $3,125 a square foot, not counting the 3,000 square feet of outdoor space. 
 ''Newly redesigned and renovated with no expense spared to create the most luxurious and important property downtown,'' says the listing, by Andrea Wohl Lucas, an associate broker at the Corcoran Group.
 The celebrity appeal may also be lagging at the penthouse at the Palazzo Chupi, a five-unit condominium building at 360 West 11th Street in the West Village, designed by the artist Julian Schnabel. The striking project, a bright pink stucco box with Venetian-style arched windows and balconies built above an old warehouse, is topped by the three-story 3,700-square-foot penthouse with 13-foot ceilings, three bedrooms and balconies and terraces with river views. ''Every fixture and detail throughout the mansion has been designed by Mr. Schnabel, resulting in a romantic piece of art in its own right,'' the listing by Maria Pashby of Corcoran notes.
 But after going on the market last spring for $32 million, it took price cuts, in stages, to $24 million, with the latest cut in the second week of October, amid the turmoil in the financial markets.
 Then there was the combined $4.5 million in price cuts in mid-September on two town houses once owned by Andy Warhol (though one, a town house at 57 East 66th Street, last listed by Carol Cohen and Deborah Grubman of Corcoran for $35 million, is now off the market). 
 And in Brooklyn, a three-story former firehouse that was the headquarters for Spike Lee's production company, 40 Acres and a Mule Filmworks, sustained a 30 percent cut, too. The 25-foot-wide three-story building (with a two-car garage behind oversized iron gates and an automatic firehouse door) was offered as a two-family house at Citi Habitats for $6 million last March. In August, the price was reduced to $5.88 million; in mid-September it was cut to $4 million. The listing by Scott Kriger notes, ''Owner will consider renting the apartments as well.''
 Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel Inc., an appraisal company, said he believed celebrity apartments were overrated and rarely commanded higher prices. But, he added, anything to do with celebrity, including the price cuts on celebrity apartments, attracts attention and can help a property sell faster. ''Anything to do with celebrity is going to get more eyeballs,'' he said.

CORRECTION-DATE: November 2, 2008

 CORRECTION:
A report in the Big Deal column on Oct. 19 about reductions in the asking prices of properties owned by celebrities misstated the current price of a three-story former firehouse in Brooklyn that was the headquarters of Spike Lee's production company. It is $4.9 million, not $4 million

HEADLINE: Rebuffed by China, Pakistan May Seek Aid from I.M.F.

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan 

 BODY:
President Asif Ali Zardari returned from China late Friday without a commitment for cash needed to shore up Pakistan's crumbling economy, leaving him with the politically unpopular prospect of having to ask the International Monetary Fund for help.
 Pakistan was seeking the aid from China, an important ally, as it faces the possibility of defaulting on its current account payments. 
 With the United States and other nations preoccupied by a financial crisis, and Saudi Arabia, another traditional ally, refusing to offer concessions on oil, China was seen as the last port of call before the I.M.F.
 Accepting a rescue package from the fund would be seen as humiliating for Mr. Zardari's government, which took office this year. 
 An I.M.F.-backed plan would require Pakistan's government to cut spending and raise taxes, among other measures, which could hurt the poor, officials said.
 The Bush administration is concerned that Pakistan's economic meltdown will provide an opportunity for Islamic militants to capitalize on rising poverty and frustration. 
 The Pakistanis have not been shy about exploiting the terrorist threat to try to win financial support, a senior official at the I.M.F. said.
 But because of the dire global financial situation, and the reluctance of donor nations to provide money without strict economic reforms by Pakistan, the terrorist argument has not been fully persuasive, he said. 
 ''A selling point to us even has been, if the economy really collapses this is going to mean civil strife, and strikes, and put the war on terror in jeopardy,'' said the official, who declined to be identified because he was not authorized to speak to the news media.
 ''They are saying, 'We are a strategic country, the world needs to come to our aid,' '' he said. 
 Pakistani officials said they had received promises from the Chinese to help build two nuclear power plants, and pledges for business investment in the coming year.
 But Pakistan had also hoped China would deposit $1.5 billion to $3 billion in its central bank, according to senior officials at the I.M.F. and Western donor countries.
 The infusion of cash would have helped with payments for oil and food as currency reserves dwindle, officials said. 
 Shaukat Tareen, the new Pakistani financial adviser who accompanied Mr. Zardari to China, began to prepare the public for an I.M.F. program on Saturday, saying for the first time at a news conference that if Pakistan could not stabilize its economy within 30 days, it ''can go to the I.M.F. as a backup.''
 ''We may have to go to Plan B,'' he said.
 Economic hardship has been mounting across Pakistan for several months. Electricity shortages have become so dire that even middle-class families in big cities have to ration supply, with power cuts for 12 of every 24 hours, with one hour on, and one hour off. 
 Food prices have soared, making some basics, even flour, too expensive for the poorest to afford. No large-scale riots have occurred, but concern is mounting that such protests are not far off.
 The new government has reduced subsidies on fuel and food, and the central bank moved on Friday to ease an intrabank liquidity crisis.
 In addition, new rules were imposed several weeks ago on the Karachi stock exchange to stop sell-offs.
 But none of those steps have stanched the crisis in confidence.
 The central bank's currency reserves have dipped to $4 billion, enough to cover payments for oil and other imports for about two months. As it became clear over the past two days that the Chinese were not going to provide a cushion for Pakistan, the rupee slumped to a record low. 
 The thin results from the China trip were of little surprise to Western donors. 
 Asked about the likelihood of Pakistan winning the direct cash infusion it was seeking, a senior Chinese diplomat was reported by Western officials to have said, ''We have done our due diligence, and it isn't happening.'' 
 ''What we needed is $3-to-$4 billion,'' said Sakib Sherani, a member of the government's economic advisory panel and chief economist at ABN Amro Bank in Pakistan. That amount was necessary ''to build confidence,'' he said.
 The central bank governor, Shamshad Akhtar, said in a telephone interview on Saturday, ''We are very open to all kinds of financial support.'' She added, ''We've taken a lot of corrective actions, and we plan to take more.''
 But Zubair Khan, a former commerce minister and a critic of the government's economic management, said confidence would improve once Pakistan arranged an I.M.F. rescue package. Mr. Khan said that the alternative would be the imposition of controls on imports and capital flows that could do long-term harm to the economy.
 Meanwhile, the American financial crisis is also expected to hurt ordinary Pakistanis.
 Remittances from Pakistanis living abroad to their relatives in Pakistan were expected to be about $7 billion this year, about $3 billion of that from Pakistanis living in the United States. But those remittances are likely to dwindle, affecting real estate values in Pakistani cities and families who live in poorer rural areas.
 Mr. Zardari had approached the China trip with considerable fanfare, saying he was looking forward to visiting a country that had enjoyed a warm relationship with Pakistan, particularly during the rule of his father-in-law, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. 
 His visit to Beijing followed a trip there by the chief of the army, Gen. Parvez Kayani, and came at a time when the relationship between Washington and Pakistan was strained over how to deal with the escalating threat from the Taliban and Al Qaeda. 
 Javed Burki, a former Pakistani finance minister, said China had provided $500 million in balance-of-payments support in 1996, when Pakistan was on the brink of default. He had flown to Beijing to ask for the money and his request was fulfilled.
 But those days are over, he said, because China is no longer inclined to grant cash outright without structural reforms from the receiving government, he said.

HEADLINE: Keeping Their Opinions to Themselves

BYLINE: By CLARK HOYT

 BODY:
LAST Tuesday, The Times ran a Political Memo about the content and style of Sarah Palin's campaign speeches, and I braced for an outpouring of protest from her supporters.
 The article began, ''Here is the thing about Gov. Sarah Palin: She loves America. Really loves it.'' I thought it sounded sarcastic and condescending, The New York Times making fun of a rube from Alaska, and I was sure others would too.
 But every reader I heard from had an entirely different reaction. They focused on the reporter's assertion that Palin is ''the most electrifying speechmaker'' on a major party ticket this year, a candidate who ''generates enormous fervor at her events.'' Stephen Lathrop of Hull, Mass., said The Times was allowing itself to ''become the victim of a skillful manipulation'' and that it had turned into ''an involuntary Palin booster.''
 Patrick Healy, the reporter, said he intended neither to praise Palin nor to belittle her. After two days on the trail with her, listening to her speeches, her casual remarks to voters and interviewing her advisers, Healy said he was trying to capture the tone and content of her campaign, which stresses patriotism and does not go into policy details. 
 Throughout this election season, most of the thousands of messages I have received about Times news coverage have alleged bias -- bias in headlines, photo selections, word choices, what the newspaper chooses to write about and what it ignores, what it puts on Page 1 and what it puts inside. Most of the complaints, but by no means all of them, have come from the right. Nobody acknowledges the possibility that, because of their own biases, they could be reading more, or less, than was intended into an article, a headline or a picture. Many go a step beyond alleging mere bias to accuse The Times of operating from a conscious agenda to help one candidate and destroy the other.
 ''It's so obvious who the NYT is supporting for the presidency,'' said Cheryl Page of Jackson, Miss. ''How sad that our media can't just report the news, rather than print their opinions in biased ways.'' There is a proper place for opinion in The Times -- the editorial and Op-Ed pages -- and there is no doubt that most of the newspaper's regular columnists and its editorial policy favor Obama. It would be a shock if The Times did not endorse him. 
 But the paper's news coverage is another matter. It is supposed to be evenhanded. I think I've seen bias from time to time, and I think The Times made a serious mistake early this year that gave its critics on the right a lot of ammunition: an article that suggested, but failed to prove, a romantic relationship between John McCain and a female lobbyist. (The Op-Ed page, though independent from the newsroom, added to the problem when it ran an article by Obama without first securing a companion piece from McCain. McCain then offered a rebuttal, but when the paper asked for major revisions, he refused and his supporters cried foul.) But I think the news coverage over a long campaign has been better and fairer than critics would admit. 
 Richard Stevenson, the editor in charge of political coverage, says reporters and editors know they are under close scrutiny and work hard to keep bias out of their work. He acknowledges, ''We no doubt fall short occasionally.'' But that does not mean the newsroom is engaged in an organized effort to tear down McCain -- or Obama, as some think -- and raise up the other candidate.
 Bias is a tricky thing. None of us are objective. We like news that supports our views and dislike what may challenge them. We tend to pick apart each article, word by word, failing to remember that it is part of a river of information from which facts can be plucked to support many points of view. Perversely, we magnify what displeases us and minimize what we like. 
 I spoke to a group in Montclair, N.J., last Monday evening and asked how many thought The Times was a biased newspaper. More than half the hands went up. A man who identified himself as a conservative Republican said The Times always plays up scandals involving Republicans and buries scandals involving Democrats. He had forgotten that just this year The Times broke the story of the sex-for-pay scandal that brought down New York's Democratic governor, Eliot Spitzer, and published a series of investigative stories on Representative Charles Rangel, another Democrat, that put his chairmanship of the House Ways and Means Committee in jeopardy. When reminded, he said, ''I'd call that good journalism.'' 
 There is an entire body of scholarship devoted to what social scientists call the ''hostile media'' syndrome, the belief of people with strong feelings about an issue -- any issue -- that the news media are hostile to their side. 
 ''Journalism is not brain surgery; it's more difficult than that,'' said Andrew Cline, an assistant professor of journalism at Missouri State University, who has written on the perception of bias in news coverage. He said it was impossible for a reporter, in a single article, ''to cover a situation in a way that everyone involved sees themselves the way they understand themselves.'' News coverage has to be judged for fairness over a period of time, he said.
 In political coverage, the accusations are always that the reporter or publication has ideological or party bias. But Cline has written that journalists have a whole set of professional biases that have nothing to do with politics. Journalists are biased toward conflict, toward bad news because it is more exciting than good news, and, obviously, toward what is new. When Obama was the new candidate on the presidential scene, The Times did some tough reporting on his background and record. But that was a long time ago, and memories fade. Palin was new much more recently, so the tough reporting on her happened closer to the general election, leading her supporters to complain that The Times was picking on her and giving Obama a pass.
 Being human, journalists do have personal biases, and a long line of studies has shown that they tend to be more socially and politically liberal than the population at large. There is no reason to believe Times journalists are any different. But Tien-Tsung Lee, an associate professor of journalism at the University of Kansas, wrote in 2005 after reviewing the literature that ''a link between reporters' political beliefs and news coverage has never been convincingly established.''
 Bill Keller, the executive editor of The Times, said, ''Our responsibility, as Times journalists, is to set our personal biases aside, approach the news with an open, skeptical mind, and present readers with the information they need to make up their own minds.'' He said editors talk a lot about filtering out bias in campaign coverage. Though anger toward The Times is now coming mostly from the Republican camp, Keller said he worried early on that reporters might favor McCain because he had been so accessible, charming them with his bluntness and irreverence. ''As the McCain campaign closed off access and took up press-bashing, we had to be on guard for the opposite,'' Keller said.
 So, why is The Times coming under such relentless fire? Conservatives are sure they know and have anecdotes to support their view. But a lot more feeds into the stream of dissatisfaction, some of it beyond the newspaper's control. The Times is aggressive this year in assessing the truthfulness of the candidates' statements and ads, often putting it in an adversarial position with them. The newspaper has run many interpretive articles in the news columns, increasing the opportunities for bias, real or perceived. Finally, the McCain campaign has gone on the attack against The Times and the media since the economy turned sour and his poll numbers began sinking.
 ''I wouldn't want to be a journalist now,'' said S. Robert Lichter, a professor of communication at George Mason University who is tracking network television coverage this year. Lichter got a taste of what it feels like in July. He released a study concluding that Obama was faring worse than McCain on television news. Bill O'Reilly of Fox News, who had previously praised Lichter's work as proving that the media was liberal, was incensed and rejected the study. ''A study like yours gives the bad guys in the media -- and they are legion now -- protection,'' O'Reilly said.
 O'Reilly will presumably be happy again with Lichter, now that his newest study, released last week, concluded that Obama had pulled ahead of McCain in favorable coverage.
 Like a lot of news consumers -- and at least some Times readers -- O'Reilly appears to have a hard time with information that does not fit his view of the world. It is a tough reality every news organization faces.
