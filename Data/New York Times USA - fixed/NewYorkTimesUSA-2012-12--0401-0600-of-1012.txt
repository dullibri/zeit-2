HEADLINE: The 30-Minute Interview: Steven B. Tanger

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Tanger, 63, is the president and chief executive of Tanger Factory Outlet Centers, a publicly traded real estate investment trust based in Greensboro, N.C.
Mr. Tanger's father, Stanley K. Tanger, started the company in 1981 with one of the country's first outlet centers, in Burlington, N.C.
Interview conducted and condensed by 
VIVIAN MARINO
Q. How is the holiday shopping season going?
A. We are planning for a really good shopping season. Our Black Friday was a record-breaking Black Friday. Our traffic was up; sales were up across the country.
Q. Do you have any numbers?
A. We do not report interim month sales. Actually we don't even report monthly sales. But anecdotally I know, because we count cars in and out of our shopping centers and know that traffic was up significantly over the last year.
Q. Retailers started early. Your own outlets were open on Thanksgiving this year.
A. We opened at 10 in the evening in response to requests from our tenants -- they wanted to be competitive. It's part of the Thanksgiving ritual for a lot of families now to enjoy their dinner, watch a football game and then go shopping. I don't know how much earlier in the day it will go. I think there will be some social issues as it gets earlier into the day. But 10 in the evening or midnight seems to be a fun time for people to go out.
Interestingly, sales in the outlet stores started on Veterans Day weekend, well before Black Friday. About 60 percent of our tenants offered terrific prices on Veterans Day weekend, and another 20 percent broke price the weekend before Black Friday.
Q. To what do you attribute the increase in traffic to your outlets?
A. People who have jobs are secure in their jobs now, because their corporations have enhanced their balance sheets. People are now coming back into the work force looking for jobs. Second, there's about three million people net added to the population of the U.S. each year and that gets overlooked in any of the discussions.
Q. How has 2012 been so far for Tanger's bottom line?
A. Comp sales, or same-store sales, were up 7 percent for the third quarter and 5.4 percent year to date. Same-center net operating income was up 5.6 percent for the quarter and 6.5 percent year to date. We're guiding the Street to an increase of 6 percent in same-center N.O.I. for 2012. We now have 31 consecutive quarters that have had net operating income increases. That's almost eight years through the recession. I might say that our balance sheet is a fortress and that allowed us to get through the recession.
Our rents, or what we call our rent spread, blended between the renewals and space we get back and we control, was over a 30 percent increase for new leases at existing centers over the rent in the prior lease.
Q. Can you provide numbers for things like occupancy, renewals and leases?
A. At the end of the quarter we were 98.6 percent occupied. Historically, 80 to 85 percent of the tenants renew in the same space with us.
Our leases are usually five years in duration; in new developments it's maybe five years with one five-year option.
Our tenants average about 4,000 square feet. We do not have a large department-store-like anchor. The largest tenants we have may be 20,000 to 25,000 square feet, which means in a 400,000-square-foot shopping center we'll have 100 tenants. In a mall, 400,000 square feet may be two department stores.
Q. Who are your biggest tenants?
A. Our largest tenant by square footage is Gap, which includes the Gap, Banana Republic and Old Navy.
Another very large tenant is the PVH Corporation, which encompasses Tommy Hilfiger, Calvin Klein, Bass, Van Heusen shirts and Izod.
Q. Let's talk about Tanger's expansion plans.
A. We opened an outlet in the middle of October in Houston, in a joint venture with Simon Property Group. It's on the interstate between Houston and Galveston and 30 days later, in the middle of November, we opened in Westgate. It's near Phoenix, in Glendale, Ariz.
Last week we broke ground on our new development site in National Harbor, which is in Prince George's County, Md., near Washington. That is expected to open about a year from now.
Q. What's the status of your planned outlet center in Charlotte, N.C.?
A. We haven't broken ground yet -- hopefully in the spring. The site in Charlotte will be developed and built by Tanger; we will co-lease it with Simon and then it will be a Charlotte Premium Center, which will be managed and marketed by Simon.
We are 50-50 partners in Houston also.
And we announced at the same time a joint venture in Columbus, Ohio. That site will be developed and built by Simon, and we will co-lease it. It will be a Tanger outlet and we will operate and manage it.
Q. Do you prefer ground-up construction or acquisitions?
A. They each have a place in our growth strategy. We bought five projects, totaling about 1.3 million square feet, last year and we're in the process of ''Tangerizing'' them right now, which means upgrading the facilities, the restrooms, freshening up and renovating the property, and putting the right tenants in the right places.
We bought in Hershey, Pa.; Jeffersonville, Ohio; Ocean City, Md.; Atlantic City, N.J.; and Cookstown, Ontario.
Q. Has the proliferation of online shopping affected your business?
A. We have been monitoring online sales since the mid-1990s, and every year since the mid-1990s our sales have gone up significantly and online business has gone up.
Q. Where do you do your shopping?
A. I buy some of my clothes in the outlet stores, some in department stores, some in specialty stores.
Occasionally I'll buy books, music or movies on the Internet. But I like to touch and feel. I like to go and see it and understand what it's going to look like.
Q. Do you get any discounts?
A. I don't ask and I don't receive a discount. I'd rather pay full price and not have our merchant partners ask me for a discount.

HEADLINE: Rate Inquiry Accelerates With Arrests In London

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and MARK SCOTT; Azam Ahmed and Ian Austen contributed reporting.

 BODY:
9 p.m. | Updated
American and British authorities are shifting to an aggressive new phase in their broad investigation of interest-rate manipulation as they identify potential criminal targets and complete settlements with some of the world's biggest banks.
In a sign of the escalation, Britain's Serious Fraud Office made the first arrests in connection with the rate-rigging inquiry on Tuesday.
In a predawn raid, police took three men into custody at their homes on the outskirts of London. One of the men is Thomas Hayes, 33, a former trader at UBS and Citigroup, according to people briefed on the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. The other two men arrested worked for the British brokerage firm R P Martin, said another person briefed on the matter.
British authorities typically make arrests in the early stages of an inquiry, and the actions on Tuesday do not necessarily signal that the individuals will be charged with wrongdoing. 
UBS, Citigroup and R P Martin declined to comment. A lawyer for Mr. Hayes, who has not been accused of any wrongdoing, could not be reached for comment.
Mr. Hayes also faces scrutiny from American authorities. The Justice Department could file criminal charges against him in the coming weeks, according to people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing. The people cautioned that American authorities had not made a decision about charging Mr. Hayes and might have difficulty extraditing him to the United States.
The evidence against Mr. Hayes is considered a linchpin in a broader case involving UBS, the Swiss banking giant. UBS is expected to settle accusations that Mr. Hayes and other employees carried out a scheme to push interest rates up and down to bolster trading profits, according to the people briefed on the matter. The people said the expected settlement, which could come as early as Friday, would include more than $450 million in fines and wider sanctions, the largest penalties to date related to the rate-rigging inquiry.
Building on the momentum in the UBS inquiry, authorities are preparing a spate of civil and criminal actions. After gathering thousands of internal bank e-mails and interviewing dozens of employees over the last four years, regulators and prosecutors are using the evidence to negotiate settlements with banks and draw up arrest orders for individuals.
The cases have deep roots. Regulators around the world have been investigating more than a dozen big banks that help set benchmarks like the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. Such benchmark rates are used to determine the borrowing costs for trillions of dollars in financial products, including credit cards, student loans and mortgages.
In June, authorities scored their first major victory, extracting a $450 million settlement with Barclays, the big British bank. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Justice Department and the Financial Services Authority of Britain claimed that Barclays traders tried to manipulate Libor to bolster profits. They also claimed that Barclays had submitted low rates to deflect concerns about its health during the financial crisis.
Other banks are bracing for the potential fallout, including major fines and regulatory sanctions. The Royal Bank of Scotland, which is in settlement talks with regulators, said it would probably disclose fines before its next earnings report, in February. Deutsche Bank, Germany's largest bank, said in November that it had put aside money for potential penalties related to the Libor case.
Even as authorities prepare a new wave of actions, they have not always coordinated with each other. Some American authorities were caught off guard when the Serious Fraud Office announced the arrests on Tuesday. And the various regulators are still not certain if they will jointly announce the UBS settlement this month, according to the people briefed on the matter.
The Justice Department's criminal division and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's enforcement unit, in contrast, have kept close ties. Lanny A. Breuer, head of the Justice Department's criminal division, and David Meister, who runs the commission's enforcement team, are said to be friends. As they built Libor cases over the last two years, the units have shared evidence that they say points to a systemic problem with the rate-setting processes.
The Serious Fraud Office is a relative newcomer to the Libor case. After hesitating to enter the investigation, the agency opened a criminal inquiry into Libor manipulation in July, in response to the furor over the rate-rigging scandal at Barclays.
"The S.F.O. works incredibly slowly," said a defense lawyer representing other individuals implicated in the Libor inquiry, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "It's not surprising that people have been arrested. But how long it will take to lead to criminal charges is another matter."
Under British law, London police can hold the three men arrested on Tuesday for 24 hours. Authorities can apply for an extension if they need more time for questioning the men.
Mr. Hayes, who got his start at the Royal Bank of Canada, built his reputation as an interest rates trader at UBS, a person briefed on the matter said. He worked at UBS's Tokyo office from about 2006 to 2009 before departing for Citigroup. At the American bank, he received a promotion, earning a director title.
Mr. Hayes spent less than six months trading at Citigroup. The bank suspended him in 2010 after he approached a London trading desk about improperly influencing the yen-denominated Libor rates, a person briefed on the matter said. He was fired in September 2010, and the bank reported his suspected actions to authorities.
UBS also raised concerns about Mr. Hayes to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, according to another person briefed on the matter. In the course of an internal investigation, the Swiss bank concluded that Mr. Hayes had worked with traders at other banks to influence rates, according to officials and court documents.
At the time, the trading commission ordered other institutions that helped set Libor rates to conduct similar inquiries. Those investigations have formed the basis of the agency's cases.
Mr. Hayes also emerged in court documents filed this year by Canadian authorities. The documents - collected by Canada's Competition Bureau, the country's antitrust authority - highlight an alleged scheme in which Mr. Hayes and other traders may have colluded to influence yen Libor rates. The Canadian investigation, which covers conduct from 2007 to 2010, also referred to traders at JPMorgan Chase, HSBC, Deutsche Bank and the Royal Bank of Scotland.
The traders, the documents said, at times corresponded using instant messages on Bloomberg machines. While the activity took place outside Canada, the trading affected financial contracts in the country that were pegged to yen Libor.
The traders further asked middlemen at brokerage firms "to use their influence" on other banks that set Libor, according to the documents. The brokers included employees at R P Martin, a person briefed on the matter said.
"Traders at participants' banks communicated with each other their desire to see a higher or lower yen Libor to aid their trading positions," the Canadian documents said.
Azam Ahmed and Ian Austen contributed reporting.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: S.&P. Closes Near Level Set on Election Day

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks rose on Tuesday, led by gains in technology companies, helping the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index to end at its highest level since Election Day. 
A 2.18 percent gain, to $541.39, in Apple's stock lifted the Nasdaq composite index, as the company rebounded from a week in which investors took profits before a possible tax increase next year. Before Tuesday's trading, Apple shares had lost 25 percent from an intraday high hit in September.
Stocks pared some gains by late afternoon as more news on the negotiations over a fiscal policy in Washington emerged. The Senate majority leader, Harry Reid, said it would be difficult to reach an agreement resolving tax increases and spending cuts before Christmas.
''There's been a real explosion in anxiety over this thing,'' said James Dailey, portfolio manager of Team Asset Strategy Fund in Harrisburg, Pa. ''Because markets have become the way they are, you've got people just stepping back.''
The S.& P. 500 had lost 5.3 percent in the seven sessions after Election Day as investors refocused on the threat posed to the economy by the fiscal cliff, a series of automatic spending cuts and tax increases that would result if the fiscal negations fail. Markets have mostly recovered those losses, but volume has been thin, suggesting investors are not betting aggressively because of the uncertainty.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 78.56 points, or 0.6 percent, to 13,248.44.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 9.29 points, or 0.65 percent, to 1,427.84.
The Nasdaq composite index was up 35.34 points, or 1.18 percent, at 3,022.30.
Other major tech stocks also rose. Texas Instruments gained 4 percent, to $31.01, after raising its profit target late Monday. That helped other chip makers rally. The PHLX Semiconductor index was up 1.9 percent. Microsoft rose 1.41 percent, to $27.32.
The lack of demonstrable progress in the federal budget negotiations has kept investors from making aggressive bets in recent weeks.
Retailers like the luggage maker Tumi Holdings and Michael Kors Holding gained after a positive report from Goldman Sachs Equity Research. Tumi was up 4.73 percent, to $21.92, and Michael Kors gained 2.35 percent, reaching $50.92.
The discount retailers Dollar General and Family Dollar declined. Dollar General, down 7.8 percent, to $42.94, said it expected margins to be under pressure in 2013. Family Dollar shares dropped 8.36 percent, to $64.68.
The Treasury is selling its remaining stake in the insurer American International Group. Shares of AIG were up 5.7 percent at $35.26.
The Fed began a two-day policy-setting meeting on Tuesday. The central bank is expected to announce a new round of Treasury bond purchases when the meeting ends on Wednesday. They will replace its Operation Twist stimulus, which expires at the end of the year.
Interest rates were higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 11/32, to 99 23/32, and the yield rose to 1.66 percent, from 1.62 percent late Monday.

HEADLINE: Courting Merit Scholars Opens Door to Questions

BYLINE: By RICHARD PÉREZ-PEÑA

 BODY:
NORMAN, Okla. -- An introductory course here in American government offers the kind of intimate, interactive learning that scholars prize: just 20 students, most of them freshmen, debating the merits of the Senate filibuster one recent morning, and parrying pointed questions from a professor who knew their names.
Small colleges specialize in this style of learning, but this is the University of Oklahoma, the kind of large institution where most students enrolled in lower-level courses are more likely to be listening to lectures than taking part in discussions. Adding to the course's cachet is a professor who brings rare authority to the subject: David L. Boren, the university president and a former governor and United States senator.
But a great majority of the university's students do not have access to this course, or dozens of others like it. Mr. Boren's class is part of Oklahoma's honors program, and most of the students in it are National Merit Scholarship winners. 
This month, 1.5 million high school juniors will receive their scores on the Preliminary SAT exam, the first step toward learning whether they will belong to that sliver -- about one-half of 1 percent of students who take the test -- who will win National Merit Scholarships. Of those who do, a striking number will be taking classes here two years from now.
Oklahoma enrolls more National Merit scholars than any other public university in the country, by a wide margin -- about 200 per year, more than the University of California, Berkeley; the University of Michigan; and the University of Texas at Austin, combined.
Oklahoma specifically targets National Merit scholars for recruitment, seeing them as a way to raise the university's quality and profile. And while some academic administrators dislike the practice, many of Oklahoma's peers do the same, though not with the same fervor or favors.
At Oklahoma, National Merit scholars are given scholarships based on academic credentials, money to study abroad, housing primarily for high-achieving students, research opportunities, a writing center, priority in choosing some classes, and an Honors College -- a school within a school -- with smaller, more challenging classes.
''We give scholarships for athletic achievement, so why not for academic achievement?'' said Mr. Boren, a Yale graduate and former Rhodes scholar. ''I want them to get the kind of opportunity at home that they would get in the Ivy League.''
In fact, many Honors College students say that they could have gone to the some of the nation's most selective colleges, but came here looking for some of the same experience at a fraction of the price. Thomas Owens, a sophomore studying chemical engineering, said he was accepted to Duke University, where tuition and fees top $55,000. ''My family could have managed it,'' he said, ''but this was so much less of a burden, it's amazing.''
The university charges $17,087.50 per year for tuition, fees, room and board, for students from Oklahoma, and $28,724.50 for out-of-state students. Officials said the price for National Merit scholars varies, but is less than half as much.
Oklahoma's program touches on a long-running argument within higher education, about the role of ''merit aid'' -- scholarships that schools give on the basis of credentials like grades, test scores or musical skills -- versus the aid that nearly all schools give on the basis of a student's financial need. Most colleges give some academic merit aid (though some of the wealthiest and most selective schools do not), and the amount has increased over the years as competition for top students grows more fierce. Oklahoma's honors program is an extreme example.
''There are those, me included, who say the purpose of aid should be to help people go to college who might not be able to otherwise,'' said Donald Heller, dean of the College of Education at Michigan State University. ''Giving merit scholarships to kids who would have been going to college anyway can benefit the institution without necessarily benefiting the broader public.''
The dispute is especially sharp when it comes to state schools, which face dwindling resources and are seen as having a public service mission, but it is largely confined to those who study education policy. Oklahoma's program draws little other fire, on or off campus, even given that about half of the National Merit scholars come from out of state.
''I guess it's a good thing if you get smarter people to come here,'' said Ashley Blackburn, a sophomore biology major who is not in the honors program. ''I don't think anyone resents it. You deserve rewards if you do well.''
The National Merit figures are a bragging point for the university and are mentioned repeatedly on its Web site and in its publications. University officials say that attracting top students is worth the added cost and has helped Oklahoma rise in academic rankings over the last generation.
''Having these kinds of classmates motivates other students, it elevates class discussions, it's a recruiting tool when we go after new students or faculty,'' said David Ray, a political science professor and dean of the Honors College. ''We don't just throw money at them to get them here; we give them unique opportunities once they're here.''
Oklahoma has plenty of company, among both public and private universities, in giving scholarships to large numbers of students based on National Merit status. Texas A&M University, the University of Southern California and Washington University in St. Louis all do the same. Some top public schools halted the practice in recent years, though many of them still reward academic credentials.
''We decided that basing a big hunk of aid mostly on a single test that people take in 11th grade was too one-dimensional,'' said Tom Melecki, the director of financial services at the University of Texas at Austin.
After becoming president at Oklahoma 18 years ago, Mr. Boren greatly expanded a small honors program and created the Honors College, which now has about 2,200 students, one-tenth of the university's undergraduate enrollment. Early on, he had the university put a particular emphasis on National Merit scholars, a visible, readily defined elite group, who now make up more than one-third of the Honors College enrollment.
Students must apply for admission to the college and meet a more stringent set of standards to graduate from it. They take about one-quarter of their classes within the college and the rest with the general student body. (Mr. Boren gets a firsthand look at the differences, alternating between teaching the honors version of his government class and a regular version with more than 200 students.)
For the honors students, the results are hard to beat; this year's senior class in Oklahoma's Honors College has winners of the Rhodes, Marshall and Mitchell scholarships.
Jerod Coker, the Marshall scholar, is an economics major who has been accepted to law schools at Berkeley and Duke, and next year he will study at the London School of Economics.
''Paying for private school was out of the question for my family,'' he said. ''The criticism of something like the Honors College might be valid, I don't know, but it's the only way I could have had this kind of experience.''

HEADLINE: Limits on Unions Pass in Michigan, Once a Mainstay

BYLINE: By MONICA DAVEY; Steven Greenhouse contributed reporting from New York, Mary M. Chapman from Lansing and Steven Yaccino from Chicago.

 BODY:
LANSING, Mich. -- With Democrats and labor leaders vowing retribution at the ballot box and beyond, the Republican-dominated Michigan Legislature on Tuesday approved sweeping, statewide changes to the way unions will be financed, substantially reducing their power in a state that has long been a symbol of union might and an incubator for the American labor movement.
As thousands of incensed union members filled the Capitol rotunda and poured out onto its lawn chanting ''shame, shame,'' labor leaders and Democrats said they would immediately mount an intense, unceasing campaign to regain control of the Legislature and the governor's office by 2015.
But advocates of the legislation, which outlaws requirements that workers pay fees to unions as a condition of employment, lauded the day as a historic turning point for economic health in Michigan, and some Republicans predicted that their victory here would embolden other states to enact similar measures. 
The legislation, which Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, signed almost immediately, is the latest in series of setbacks to organized labor in states where it has traditionally been strong, like Indiana and Wisconsin. National labor leaders predicted a backlash and said they were weighing options in the courts and in future elections.
''We are not going to end it today,'' said Lee Saunders, the president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. ''We will be in the streets,'' he said, adding, ''If we have to work it through 2014 and change the makeup of the legislatures, that's what we'll do.''
Some were talking about calling for some sort of ballot initiative, aimed at accomplishing what union supporters had in Ohio in 2011 after efforts to sharply limit collective bargaining there. Other recent history suggests that such efforts can be difficult. In Wisconsin, a push to recall the governor over cuts to collective bargaining failed this year.
Though Republicans control the Legislature, Mr. Snyder, a former businessman who had not held public office before his election in 2010, had regularly sidestepped the most divisive issues, including legislation restricting unions, with talk of ''relentless positive action.'' This chapter came as a surprise to many here and seemed to open a gulf.
Some lawmakers grew tearful as they argued over the matter on the House floor. Outside, exchanges between demonstrators on each side turned tense, leaving some screaming curses and jabbing fingers into the air.
By evening, two large canopies belonging to the opposing camps lay crumpled on the Capitol lawn, the police said. At least two people were arrested, they said, after trying to press past one of the large clusters of state troopers that stood guard at the George W. Romney Building, which houses the governor's office. And at least one police officer had used a substance similar to pepper spray during the protests.
''Today is a game changer for Michigan, for its workers and for our future,'' said Speaker Jase Bolger, a Republican who helped lead the efforts to make Michigan the nation's 24th state -- and only the second one, along with Indiana, in the traditional Midwestern manufacturing belt -- to ban requirements that workers pay fees for union representation.
The legislation here, which will go into effect next year, bans any requirement that most public and private sector employees at unionized workplaces be made to pay dues or other fees to unions. In the past, those who opted not to be union members were often required to pay fees to unions that bargained contracts for all employees at their workplace.
But the change means vastly different things to the two sides. Advocates say that it is attractive to businesses looking to move and that it allows workers to make choices about unions.
''This is the day when Michigan freed its workers,'' Lisa Posthumus Lyons, a Republican state representative who said her family included union members, told colleagues during the intense debate on Tuesday, which ended with votes along largely party lines. Last week, the Senate passed the package -- one bill dealing with public workers, the other with employees of private companies.
Critics say the legislation encourages workers not to pay union dues (but still gain contract benefits through them), weakens unions and tends to drive down wages.
''I was hoping that this day would never come,'' said Mark Meadows, a Democratic state representative. ''In the last two years, there's been a chipping away at bargaining. But today, the corporations delivered the coup de grâce.''
Many opponents expressed fury over the process here as well, one that Democrats denounced as rushed, sneaky and ''under cover of darkness.''
Only last Thursday, during the final days of the departing Legislature's meetings, did Mr. Snyder, who had long said he did not consider the legislation to be on his agenda, first announce publicly that he intended support such a measure. Later that day, language was being introduced in the chambers in the form of substituted bills that required little additional public airing. Within six days, the bills were finished and signed. Attached to the bills were financial appropriations, which make any effort at voter repeal more arduous.
Republicans defended the tactics, saying that the notion of outlawing the union fee requirements for workers as a condition of employment had long been debated in Michigan and that now was the time to act. Speed, some said, was merely intended to avoid mounting division and chaos in the Capitol.
Mr. Snyder signed the bills without fanfare on Tuesday afternoon, alerting reporters of it after the fact. ''There were a number of people out protesting, so I don't see the need to have a public signing ceremony to overemphasize that,'' Mr. Snyder said, insisting that the moves were not ''anti-union.'' ''Because this isn't about us versus them. This is about us being Michiganders and trying to work together.''
To some, including those carrying signs on the lawn and chanting ''no justice, no peace'' inside the Capitol rotunda, that seemed doubtful anytime soon.
''We're going to have to do a better job in Michigan and other states where 'right to work' is being discussed -- that you can't be in favor of collective bargaining and what collective bargaining represents for ordinary people in terms of some counterweight to growing income inequality and still support right-to-work legislation,'' said Craig Becker, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s general counsel.
Back at the Capitol, Frank Burger, a teacher from the Flint area, shook his head. ''This is disgusting, and it's not over,'' he said. ''These people just handed over the election to the Democrats in 2014. Just watch.''

HEADLINE: North Koreans Launch Rocket In Defiant Act

BYLINE: By CHOE SANG-HUN and DAVID E. SANGER; Choe Sang-hun reported from Seoul, and David E. Sanger from Washington.

 BODY:
SEOUL, South Korea -- North Korea launched a long-range rocket on Wednesday morning that appeared to reach as far as the Philippines, an apparent success for the country's young and untested new leader, Kim Jong-un, and a step toward the nation's goal of mastering the technology needed to build an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The North American Aerospace Defense Command, or Norad, said it had detected the launching and tracked the missile -- a Galaxy-3 rocket, called the Unha-3 by the North -- as its first stage appeared to fall into the Yellow Sea and the second stage into the Philippine Sea.
''Initial indications are that the missile deployed an object that appeared to achieve orbit,'' Norad said. ''At no time was the missile or the resultant debris a threat to North America.'' 
But the timing of the launching appeared to take American officials by surprise. Just an hour or two before blastoff from the Sohae Satellite Launching Station in Tongchang-ri on North Korea's western coast, near China, American officials at a holiday reception at the Japanese ambassador's residence in Washington said they thought the North Koreans had run into technical problems that could take them weeks to resolve.
North Korea's official Korean Central News Agency said the rocket succeeded in the ostensible goal of putting an earth-observation satellite named Kwangmyongsong-3, or Shining Star-3, into orbit, and celebrations by members of the North Korean media were reported.
Although the launching was driven in part by domestic considerations, analysts said it carried far-reaching foreign relations implications, coming as leaders in Washington and Beijing -- as well as those soon to be chosen in Tokyo and Seoul -- try to form a new way of coping with North Korea after two decades of largely fruitless attempts to end its nuclear and missile ambitions.
For President Obama, the launching deepened the complexity of dealing with the new North Korean government, after four years in which promises of engagement, then threats of deeper sanctions, have done nothing to modify the country's behavior. A statement from the White House by Tommy Vietor, the National Security Council spokesman, called the launch a ''a highly provocative act that threatens regional security, directly violates United Nations Security Council Resolutions 1718 and 1874, contravenes North Korea's international obligations, and undermines the global nonproliferation regime.''
The launching also appeared to dash the hopes of some analysts that Mr. Kim might soften North Korea's confrontational stance. It showed him instead as intent on bolstering his father's main legacy of nuclear weapons and long-range missile programs to justify his own hereditary rule.
For Mr. Kim, barely a year in office, the launching was important in three respects. Its apparent success, after a test of the same rocket failed spectacularly seconds after takeoff in April, demonstrated what one American intelligence official called ''a more professional operation'' to diagnose and solve rocket-design problems similar to those the United States encountered in the 1960s. He built credibility with the powerful North Korean military, whose ranks he purged in recent months, replacing some top leaders with his own loyalists.
He also advertised that the country, despite its backwardness and isolation, could master a missile technology that it has previously marketed to Iran, Pakistan and others. Some American officials, who have privately warned of increased missile cooperation between Iran and North Korea over the past year, have argued that the North Korean test would benefit Iran as much as North Korea.
The North has a long way to go before it can threaten neighboring countries, and perhaps one day the West Coast of the United States, with a nuclear-armed missile. It has yet to develop a nuclear warhead small enough to fit atop its missile, experts say, and it has not tested a re-entry vehicle that can withstand the heat of the atmosphere. Nor is it clear that the country knows how to aim a missile with much accuracy.
''What's important here is the symbolism, especially if the test seems reasonably successful,'' said Victor D. Cha, a scholar at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''It's not as if the U.S. can describe them anymore as a bunch of crazies who could never get anywhere with their technology. And it ends the argument that Kim Jong-un might be a young, progressive reformer who is determined to take the country in a new direction.''
The missile capabilities of a country as opaque as North Korea are notoriously hard to assess. United States and South Korean officials have said that all of the North's four multiple-stage rockets previously launched have exploded in midair or failed in their stated goal of thrusting a satellite into orbit. Nonetheless, during a visit to China early in 2011, Robert M. Gates, then Mr. Obama's defense secretary, said that North Korea was within five years of being able to strike the continental United States with an intercontinental ballistic missile.
The range of Wednesday's test would fall far short of that goal, but suggests that the North has learned much about how to launch multistage rockets.
North Korea insisted it was exercising its right to peaceful activity in space. But this is the third time the North has provoked the Obama administration -- and, to some degree, its patron the Chinese -- in four years.
The country's nuclear test in 2009 was intended to show that it had the capability to set off a nuclear explosion, though there is no evidence yet that its arsenal of a half-dozen to a dozen nuclear weapons could be deliverable outside North Korea. Then, in 2010, it showed a visiting Stanford scientist a uranium-enrichment plant that American intelligence services had missed.
The message was that the North now had a second pathway to building a bomb; all its weapons so far have been made from reprocessed plutonium from nuclear plants. At the time that the North revealed the plant, the Obama administration said it would consult with allies about an appropriate response, but the North suffered few consequences. It may be betting that the rocket launching draws a similar response.
Imposing sanctions on the North would be difficult. It has long been one of the most sanctioned countries on earth. While a further crackdown on offshore banking is possible, the North Koreans have no oil of their own to shut off. China could send a message by halting some deliveries to the North.
Wednesday's unusual wintertime rocket launching came five days before the one-year anniversary of the death of Mr. Kim's father, Kim Jong-il, on Dec. 17, which his son is trying to mark with a fanfare aimed at showcasing his dynasty's achievement in empowering the small and impoverished nation. Some experts believe another nuclear test blast cannot be far off.
The defiance Mr. Kim showed with his latest launch alarmed the region, which is going through sensitive changes of leadership. It came four days before the Dec. 16 lower-house election in Japan, where right-wing leaders have been gaining political leverage, thanks partly to North Korean threats. The provocation also presented an early test for candidates for the Dec. 19 presidential election in South Korea, all of whom have called for dialogue with the North.
''Regardless what the international community says about it, this successful launching boosts Kim Jong-un's posture by turning him into a fox in a hen house in Northeast Asia,'' said Lee Byong-chul, senior fellow at the Institute for Peace and Cooperation. ''It paints South Korea, Japan and the United States into a corner because it shows that the North's technology is advancing.''
The launching is also expected to move Japan further toward the right as tensions over the country's territorial disputes with neighboring countries remain high, Mr. Lee said.
Mr. Kim needed to redeem his April humiliation not only among his country's enemies, who he feared would not take him as a worthy foe, but also among his people, who have grown disenchanted with his government's inability to resolve the prolonged economic crisis, South Korean officials and analysts said.
Since he took power, Mr. Kim has tried to cement his authority with what analysts described as halfhearted economic reforms among some farms and factories, highlighting the perceived threats from the country's external enemies, and, most recently, raising the specter of a reign of terror through talk of ''squashing rebellious elements'' at home. A series of top generals have recently been fired or demoted.
In a statement in October, North Korea's National Defense Commission said that when ''midranking policy makers from the United States, National Security Council and C.I.A. recently met with us in official and unofficial settings,'' they tried to assure the North that Washington had no ''hostile'' intent. ''But the reality clearly showed that the messages we received from the United States were lies,'' it said, citing the United States' agreement to let South Korea nearly triple the reach of its ballistic missiles, putting all of the North within its range.
The Washington-Seoul missile deal was to help South Korea better deter North Korea's expanding missile capabilities. But North Korea called the deal a hostile move and said it now felt freer to test ''long-range missiles for military purposes.''

HEADLINE: Loopholes To Some, Lifelines To Others

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
If there is one idea that everybody seems to agree on while peering over the fiscal cliff, it is that we should close the loopholes that riddle the tax code. It is offered as a painless way to raise money, like fixing a leak or ending some unfair privilege.
But there is a problem with this consensus. Many of the things the government promotes with loopholes are truly valuable to lots of Americans. Tax credits and deductions may be murky and convoluted, and perhaps are not the best way to achieve government objectives. But that doesn't mean they serve no purpose at all. 
Consider education. The federal government has helped Americans pay for college since World War II. Lyndon Johnson's War on Poverty featured the Higher Education Act, which included grants and loans for low-income families. Jimmy Carter's Middle Income Student Assistance Act vastly increased federal aid by granting access to the middle class.
Right after winning re-election to a second term, Bill Clinton set out to surpass these efforts and provide access to at least two years of higher education to all Americans. Rather than offering federal spending as the Democrats who preceded him did, President Clinton mainly offered tax breaks for higher education: $40 billion worth of them over five years, tucked into the 1997 Taxpayer Relief Act.
It was a strategy for the times. Three years earlier, Republicans had taken control of both chambers of Congress for the first time since the 1950s. ''Republicans would vote for any tax reduction that came along without questioning it much,'' said Michael Graetz, an expert on taxation at Columbia Law School who worked in the administration of George H. W. Bush. ''Democrats found that the only way they could get the kind of spending they wanted was in the form of tax benefits.''
Through the hall of mirrors that is government budgeting, President Clinton's tax breaks for higher education accomplished two conflicting goals. They amounted to the biggest expansion in federal money for higher education since the G.I. bill. At the same time, they made the government look smaller.
Today, the political tide has turned decidedly against tax breaks. Last week, the House speaker, John A. Boehner, may have put President Clinton's higher-education benefits on the chopping block. In exchange for less spending on federal entitlements, he said Republicans could drop their vow of ''no new revenues'' and let the government raise $800 billion over 10 years by cutting or paring tax breaks.
Though the offer to raise money by closing loopholes has a bipartisan pedigree -- based on a plan proposed last year by the Democrat Erskine Bowles and the Republican Alan Simpson, the chairmen of President Obama's deficit commission -- it relies on rhetorical sleight of hand. If tax breaks are equivalent to government spending, eliminating them is equivalent to spending cuts. Mr. Boehner's offer to do away with tax breaks in exchange for cutting entitlements raises no new revenue. It amounts to cutting spending twice.
Loopholes make up a huge chunk of our government. Known as tax expenditures in the arcane lexicon of budget experts, they have grown a lot since the early 1990s -- a consequence of our increasing demand for government programs coupled with our resistance to raising taxes. Last year they added up to more than 7 percent of the nation's economic output, a sizable figure considering that all federal taxes took some 15 percent of the economy.
Many breaks do the same job as taxing and spending. One of them, for instance, allows employers to pay for employees' health insurance tax-free. As an alternative, the government might collect the revenue and offer health plans to workers. Rather than offer a mortgage interest deduction, the government could offer grants to help Americans buy homes. A subsidy for the poor could replace the earned-income tax credit.
According to Eric Toder and Donald Marron of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, including all the spendinglike exclusions as regular items in the budget increases the size of the federal government by about 4 percent of our gross domestic product. That's about $600 billion in ''hidden'' spending through the tax code last year alone.
We may want to trim or eliminate certain tax breaks for specific reasons -- because they are poorly targeted or inefficient. The exclusion for employer-provided health insurance -- which will cost the government $1 trillion over the next five years, according to the Tax Policy Center -- is pretty inefficient as a tool to deliver health care.
It leaves out not only the unemployed, but also 42 percent of working Americans, whose companies don't provide coverage despite the subsidy. By encouraging unlimited spending on health by high earners, the tax break contributes to making the United States health care system one of the most costly in the world.
Most federal tax breaks benefit primarily higher-income Americans, who face higher tax rates and therefore get a bigger break from deductions. Rather than strengthen middle-class homeownership, the deduction for mortgage interest mainly helps the affluent buy bigger homes than they otherwise would, leading to higher home prices. Critics argue that the tax break for charitable donations is often merely a subsidy for church donations and college football stadiums.
And some breaks aimed carefully to help low-income and middle-income Americans -- like the earned-income tax credit -- can pack some unhelpful incentives too. Even President Clinton's tax breaks for higher education fell short of the goal. They eased the financial burden of college, for sure, but participation was much smaller than the administration had anticipated. A report by the Congressional Research Service found that the program did very little to increase enrollment.
Just because some tax breaks are inefficient and misdirected does not necessarily mean that the goals they serve are unworthy, however. It only means that there may be more effective ways to achieve government objectives.
For instance, President Obama's fiscal stimulus made some of President Clinton's higher-education tax credits refundable, so they could help lower-income Americans who owed no income tax and could not benefit from a tax credit.
Ending the tax break for health insurance provided by employers could make sense, for example, when subsidies are available for everybody to be insured. Tax breaks for individual retirement account contributions could be rolled back in exchange for more generous Social Security benefits for the poor.
It makes sense to have an open debate about the purpose, efficacy and cost of our many tax loopholes. But that is not the same thing as simply looking for loopholes to close. It is a debate about the purpose of government and how best to achieve its goals.

HEADLINE: Too Big to Indict

 BODY:
It is a dark day for the rule of law. Federal and state authorities have chosen not to indict HSBC, the London-based bank, on charges of vast and prolonged money laundering, for fear that criminal prosecution would topple the bank and, in the process, endanger the financial system. They also have not charged any top HSBC banker in the case, though it boggles the mind that a bank could launder money as HSBC did without anyone in a position of authority making culpable decisions. 
Clearly, the government has bought into the notion that too big to fail is too big to jail. When prosecutors choose not to prosecute to the full extent of the law in a case as egregious as this, the law itself is diminished. The deterrence that comes from the threat of criminal prosecution is weakened, if not lost.
In the HSBC case, prosecutors may want the public to focus on the $1.92 billion settlement, which includes forfeiture of $1.26 billion and other penalties, as well as requirements to improve its internal controls and submit to the oversight of an outside monitor for the next five years. But even large financial settlements are small compared with the size of international major banks. More important, once criminal sanctions are considered off limits, penalties and forfeitures become just another cost of doing business, a risk factor to consider on the road to profits.
There is no doubt that the wrongdoing at HSBC was serious and pervasive. Several foreign banks have been fined in recent years for flouting United States sanctions against transferring money through American subsidiaries on behalf of clients in countries like Iran, Sudan and Cuba. HSBC's actions were even more egregious. According to several law enforcement officials with knowledge of the inquiry, prosecutors found that, for years, HSBC had also moved tainted money from Mexican drug cartels and Saudi banks with ties to terrorist groups.
Those findings echo those of a Congressional report, issued in July, which said that between 2001 and 2010, HSBC exposed the American ''financial system to money laundering and terrorist financing risks.'' Prosecutors and Congressional investigators were also alarmed by indications that senior HSBC officials might have been complicit in the illegal activity and that the bank did not tighten its lax controls against money laundering even after repeated urgings from federal officials.
Yet government officials will argue that it is counterproductive to levy punishment so severe that a bank could be destroyed in the process. That may be true as far as it goes. But if banks operating at the center of the global economy cannot be held fully accountable, the solution is to reduce their size by breaking them up and restricting their activities -- not shield them and their leaders from prosecution for illegal activities.

HEADLINE: China Woos Overseas Companies, Looking for Deals

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER and MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
HONG KONG - Even as Wall Street deal makers await a revival of the moribund merger market, Chinese companies are shopping abroad with their wallets out.
Yet they are also facing scrutiny, particularly in Washington, as Chinese corporate buying trips coincide with a growing assertiveness in Chinese foreign policy, including the deployment in recent months of surveillance vessels and even naval destroyers and frigates in a series of territorial confrontations with American allies like Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines.
So far this year, the dollar volume of Chinese acquisitions overseas is up 28 percent from the same period a year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. That compares with a 2.8 percent slump in global merger and acquisition volume over all.
Chinese international acquisitions are ahead for the year despite a slump during the third quarter, as state-owned enterprises, which are the main Chinese buyers, and some private enterprises waited for a change in the country's political leadership at the Communist Party Congress in mid-November. But now the Chinese buyers are back. 
Two deals by Chinese companies were announced this week, and bankers and lawyers say that discussions are starting or are already under way on numerous other transactions. Many of those, however, may take as long as a year to complete given China's bureaucratic approval processes.
"You will see an acceleration - you see it now," although it would not amount to an immediate flood of transactions, said André Loesekrug-Pietri, the chairman and managing partner of A Capital, a Hong Kong-based private equity fund.
Indeed, Beijing is pushing for additional deals, and has encouraged the state-controlled banking sector to finance them.
"An increase in overseas investment by Chinese companies is an inevitable trend," the commerce minister, Chen Deming, said at a conference two weeks ago, adding that China did not want to remain overwhelmingly invested in fixed-income securities.
"With foreign reserves of $3 trillion in hand," he added, "we will not sit back and watch the assets depreciate with the third round of quantitative easing. We must inject it into the real economy and make our contribution to global prosperity."
Wanxiang Group agreed on Sunday to pay $256 million to buy most of A123 Systems, a bankrupt manufacturer of high-tech batteries. And a consortium of Chinese investors agreed on the same day to pay $4.2 billion for a controlling stake in the American International Group's aircraft leasing business.
On Friday, Canada approved the $15 billion acquisition of Nexen, an energy company, by the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, or Cnooc. That deal is still pending approval by the American committee that reviews foreign investments on national security grounds, commonly known as Cfius.
A few deals may be completed this winter, but the real surge is likely to happen by next summer, bankers and lawyers said. State-owned enterprises account for as much as four-fifths of China's overseas acquisitions by value and many of their top executives are expected to change jobs this winter as the country's new leaders start promoting their followers.
While the Communist Party Congress in November produced a new Politburo, a new slate of government ministers and vice premiers must still be selected at the National People's Congress in March, a process that could also slow down deals.
Chinese regulations further require that at least three different agencies approve each overseas acquisition - the Ministry of Commerce, the National Development and Reform Commission and the State Administration of Exchange Control. The assent of a fourth, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, is needed to qualify for extra financing and faster approval in certain sectors deemed strategic, like clean energy, said Mao Tong, a partner at the law firm Squire Sanders.
But despite the long lead time for Chinese deals, bankers say the process is clearly starting.
Two of the biggest deals by Chinese companies this year were for control of North American companies. The bid for the A.I.G. business, the International Lease Finance Corporation, or I.L.F.C., is the biggest takeover by Chinese entities on record, according to data from Thomson Reuters.
The roots of that transaction were planted last fall. Members of China's new government wanted to show the country's seriousness in pursuing investments outside of China, and spent time assembling the most fitting consortium to pursue a deal for the business.
The government chose as the face of the deal Weng Xianding, a veteran of China's financial regulatory agencies who has turned to investing. His company, New China Trust, is essentially a major Chinese commercial lender, counting Western firms like Barclays among its investors.
Once the preferred consortium was formed around September, it began talking with A.I.G., with many of the details being negotiated between Mr. Weng and the American insurer's chief executive, Robert H. Benmosche. A goal for the Chinese, a person with direct knowledge of the matter said, was to conduct the talks in a "Western way," using Western advisers and not getting bogged down in traditional bureaucratic mire.
The talks were completed in just over three months, and the buyers successfully negotiated a discount of nearly half of I.L.F.C.'s book value.
Two evolving trends are apparent in Chinese international deal making, Chinese government officials, bankers, lawyers and trade experts said in interviews.
The government is putting heavy pressure on Chinese companies to seek minority stakes, and not to automatically seek full control, so as to tap foreign management expertise, two officials said. At the same time, Chinese companies are broadening their range of acquisition targets to include more industrial manufacturers and consumer brand companies, even as they maintain their interest in natural resources and financial services.
"I wouldn't say there's a desire to buy minority stakes, but I think there's a greater acceptance that's an appropriate thing to do," said Michael S. Weiss, the head of China mergers and acquisitions at Morgan Stanley.
Other bankers said that one big obstacle to the purchase of minority stakes lay in the wariness of many foreign companies in accepting a Chinese partner - particularly since nearly four-fifths of Chinese acquirers are state-owned enterprises, and most of the rest tend to have Chinese government links.
Many of today's buyers have drawn lessons from past failures and moved to assuage government regulators before striking deals. Cnooc, in particular, learned from its failed bid to buy the oil company Unocal seven years ago, and tried to apply those lessons in its pursuit of Nexen.
The Chinese company considered the deal in part because it believed that a takeover could win approval, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter. While a big player in Canada's energy community, Nexen was not one of the country's iconic companies, heading off the sort of brutal fight that surrounded a takeover battle for Potash, the producer of an important fertilizing ingredient.
Cnooc hired an army of advisers, including lobbyists and public relations specialists, to press the point that a deal would only strengthen the Canadian energy company. And Cnooc was open about much of its financing, aiming to halt concerns that it was being financed cheaply by state-run banks.
Still, national security concerns could also slow some deals. Bankers and lawyers say that Cfius, which stands for the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, can sometimes prove frustrating to would-be buyers. The group scrutinizes deals to ensure that they do not harm the country's national security interests.
Unlike the process in Canada, where negotiations with the foreign investment watchdog are public, the Cfius review takes place largely behind closed doors, and buyers are not always told why deals are rejected.
A Treasury spokeswoman, Natalie Earnest, said in a statement: "As we consider foreign investments in the United States, of course, we have an obligation - like any country - to protect our national security, and that is the exclusive focus of Cfius."
Michael R. Wessel, a Democratic appointee to the United States-China Economic and Security Review Commission, said that bipartisan concern was growing in Congress about the first of the Chinese deals to be announced this autumn, a $117.6 million acquisition of Complete Genomics, a company in Mountain View, Calif., that does DNA sequencing.
Mr. Wessel, who also advises the United Steelworkers union on trade issues, was also critical of the A.I.G. deal. He said that the Chinese government could pressure airlines to buy Chinese-made parts for their leases, and could eventually urge airlines to lease Chinese-made civilian airliners now being developed.
A spokesman for the buyers' group said in a statement that I.L.F.C. already had one of the largest aircraft order books in aviation, with a commitment to purchase up to 279 Boeing and Airbus aircraft between now and 2020. "We will continue to add to this order book as we see opportunities in the marketplace based on the market appeal of the aircraft and the economics offered by the manufacturers," he added.
Some would-be Chinese buyers have not fully considered how much work is needed to ensure that their investments will go through, advisers say.
"I think many Chinese companies in particular have not taken into account the need to be in touch with Washington policy makers about their needs," said Nancy L. McLernon, the chief executive of the Organization for International Investment, a group that represents domestic subsidiaries of foreign companies. "Those who do, fare best."
Keith Bradsher reported from Hong Kong, and Michael J. de la Merced from New York.

HEADLINE: Making Low-Income Housing a Priority

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''The Affordable Housing Crisis'' (editorial, Dec. 5) correctly argues that the severe shortage of affordable housing for low-income people should be a national priority.
Here in New York City, 340,000 poor households in unsubsidized rental housing have an average of just $4.40 per person per day left after rent. These households below the poverty line have incomes that are too low to qualify for most new housing being constructed through today's main affordable production program, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit.
The federal government should recommit itself to creating housing for the lowest income families. The New York State government can also help by plugging the holes in the rent stabilization system and by providing tax relief for low-income renters, who now pay a heavy property tax burden through their rents. 
DAVID R. JONES President and Chief Executive Community Service Society of N.Y. New York, Dec. 5, 2012
To the Editor:
You wrote about the already underfinanced federal programs for poor renters, helping only a quarter of those American families who qualify, noting that ''with nearly nine million households teetering on the verge of homelessness, the country clearly needs more support for affordable housing.''
The problem is more severe in New York City. This year, the media ran shocking stories reporting the city homeless shelter population breaking 47,000 for the first time ever, more than 19,000 children in shelters for the first time, and average stays at shelters longer than ever.
The city reported that on Dec. 7, there were 47,406 people in city shelters, including 20,225 children. That doesn't include those without homes because of Hurricane Sandy. The city has been opening temporary homeless shelters at a record pace in 2012.
New York City has both a moral and a legal obligation to provide shelter to our homeless. Affordable housing programs are more humane, more productive and more economical. Your editorial and those numbers demand better affordable housing for homeless people and those on the verge of homelessness.
BOBBY WATTS New York, Dec. 7, 2012
The writer is executive director of Care for the Homeless and board president of the National Health Care for the Homeless Council.
To the Editor:
Your editorial eloquently states the case for continuing to expand affordable housing opportunities despite concern about the country's fiscal problems.
In addition to the efforts you highlight, the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, which was enacted as part of the last major tax reform in 1986 and enjoys broad bipartisan support, has been a flexible tool to meet the housing needs of the homeless, low-income elderly, veterans and the working poor.
Over the years, this program has been responsible for almost all affordable rental housing built across the country.
Right now, 90 percent of the development of all affordable housing is financed through the tax credit. Not only does it increase the supply of quality housing for low-income families, but it also supports the economic recovery of neighborhoods in which the housing is built and creates close to 100,000 jobs a year in the construction and property management fields.
Like most tax policy, this credit will be scrutinized in the coming debate in Congress over tax reform. Losing the credit would mean losing as much as $12 billion a year of private investment in affordable housing. That shouldn't happen.

HEADLINE: For China's 'Great Renewal,' 8 Trends to Keep an Eye On

BYLINE: By BILL BISHOP. 
Bill Bishop publishes the daily Sinocism China Newsletter from Beijing. You can follow him on Twitter @niubi and Sina Weibo @billbishop.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The Bo Xilai scandal, an economic downturn and the leadership switch from Hu Jintao to Xi Jinping made 2012 one of China's most eventful years. It is hard to imagine that next year will be as exciting, but there will be change.
Here are eight likely trends for 2013: 
SHIFT IN GROWTH The economy is rebounding after slowing sharply through the first three quarters of 2012. The recovery is mostly stimulus-driven and heavily weighted toward state-owned enterprises and large industrial companies. The 2013 official target for economic growth is expected to be set at 7.5 percent. The economy should meet it, although excessive debt, a bloated state sector, entrenched special interests, income disparity, rural-urban inequality and lagging corporate profits will remain problems. Expect increased emphasis on the quality of growth, urbanization and rural reform as well as some painful progress in rebalancing from overinvestment to consumption-driven growth.
NEW LEADER Xi Jinping has moved quickly in his first three weeks to project an image of change. The government faces a growing expectations gap with its citizens and needs to rebuild public confidence. Mr. Xi is talking a lot about the Chinese dream and the "great renewal of the Chinese nation" - nationalist concepts with significant appeal. Mr. Xi's choice of Shenzhen for his first domestic inspection trip is a symbolic tribute to Deng Xiaoping's 1992 southern tour that restarted reforms after 1989. Mr. Xi's visit is most likely a signal that he is serious about pushing forward with changes. Expect renewed energy around overhauls, primarily economic and administrative but possibly some political ones.
CRACKDOWN ON CORRUPTION The new leadership has begun a public crackdown on corruption. One relatively senior official and several minor officials have already fallen. Internet exposés brought down the minor officials, but there are reports that the Communist Party's central disciplinary inspection commission has started new investigations into money laundering through Macau. Expect this antigraft campaign to ensnare more senior officials and to be the most effective in recent memory, yet ultimately stop short of addressing the systemic issues that have allowed corruption to flourish.
TROUBLE WITH THE NEIGHBORS China's external environment is increasingly complex. Mr. Xi is likely to work hard on maintaining stable relations with the United States, while at the same time expanding China's military capabilities and asserting its regional interests. China has unsettled its neighbors with its approach to the disputes over the Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea and the various islands in the South China Sea. Both issues look intractable, so a solution is unlikely in 2013. Expect a quickening arms race in Asia, increasingly nationalist rhetoric, continued tensions with Japan, Vietnam and the Philippines and growing risks of misunderstandings - and possible mishaps - as the various countries send more vessels into the disputed areas.
NOT EASY BEING GREEN China has some of the worst environmental problems in the world, and they increasingly pose a threat to social stability. The leadership is aware of the problems, and the report from the 18th Communist Party Congress included a section calling for improving the environment. Expect increased emphasis on clean energy, conservation and green growth, though the challenges are so huge that it is hard to be optimistic.
RISING ACTIVISM Environmental issues are leading to political activism. In 2012 China had several not-in-my-backyard protests involving thousands of people, many of whom mobilized online. Social media use, especially via smartphones, is rapidly expanding from urban to rural users and is making it much harder to cover up problems. The government now requires that all major industrial projects pass a social risk assessment before they begin. Expect more environmental protests as citizens become more aware of their rights and are emboldened to protect them.
INTERNET PRESSURE China has the most Internet users in the world. At some point in 2013 its population on the Internet will exceed 600 million people. China has a sophisticated Internet censorship and filtering system that is unlikely to disappear. But that does not mean the Internet will not pressure the government. Cheap smartphones with good cameras and 3G connectivity are proliferating, in large part thanks to Google's Android mobile operating system.
China is expected to have several hundred million smartphone users by the end of 2013. The Internet is unlikely to bring change to the system, certainly. But all those smartphone-wielding, social media-savvy citizens will force a more accountable authoritarianism. Expect more scandals to break online and increasingly responsive, accountable government at all levels.
OVERSEAS INVESTMENT Chinese companies are going global, by expanding their operations overseas and by acquiring foreign firms. Yet Chinese investment is a contentious issue in the United States and other developed countries, and several deals failed in 2012 at the hands of regulators. Huawei, a Chinese networking and telecommunications giant, is effectively blocked from doing business in the United States because of security concerns.
Regardless, Chinese companies will continue to invest overseas, both to increase and to secure resources. Tencent, for one, is on the verge of becoming China's first globally competitive Internet company.
Its WeChat mobile social networking application already has more than 200 million users and may give Facebook a run for its money in many developing countries. Expect growing overseas investment, increasing political scrutiny of Chinese deals and possibly invitations to WeChat from your social networking friends.
All in all, Mr. Xi appears to be a change-oriented nationalist. His energetic and straightforward style, his apparent commitment to fighting corruption and his determination to reinvigorate at least economic reform should buy the government time to tackle some of China's difficult problems in 2013.

HEADLINE: For Lesser Crimes, Rethinking Life Behind Bars

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
TALLAHASSEE, Fla. -- Stephanie George and Judge Roger Vinson had quite different opinions about the lockbox seized by the police from her home in Pensacola. She insisted she had no idea that a former boyfriend had hidden it in her attic. Judge Vinson considered the lockbox, containing a half-kilogram of cocaine, to be evidence of her guilt.
But the defendant and the judge fully agreed about the fairness of the sentence he imposed in federal court.
''Even though you have been involved in drugs and drug dealing,'' Judge Vinson told Ms. George, ''your role has basically been as a girlfriend and bag holder and money holder but not actively involved in the drug dealing, so certainly in my judgment it does not warrant a life sentence.'' 
Yet the judge had no other option on that morning 15 years ago. As her stunned family watched, Ms. George, then 27, who had never been accused of violence, was led from the courtroom to serve a sentence of life without parole.
''I remember my mom crying out and asking the Lord why,'' said Ms. George, now 42, in an interview at the Federal Correctional Institution in Tallahassee. ''Sometimes I still can't believe myself it could happen in America.''
Her sentence reflected a revolution in public policy, often called mass incarceration, that appears increasingly dubious to both conservative and liberal social scientists. They point to evidence that mass incarceration is no longer a cost-effective way to make streets safer, and may even be promoting crime instead of suppressing it.
Three decades of stricter drug laws, reduced parole and rigid sentencing rules have lengthened prison terms and more than tripled the percentage of Americans behind bars. The United States has the highest reported rate of incarceration of any country: about one in 100 adults, a total of nearly 2.3 million people in prison or jail.
But today there is growing sentiment that these policies have gone too far, causing too many Americans like Ms. George to be locked up for too long at too great a price -- economically and socially.
The criticism is resonating with some state and federal officials, who have started taking steps to stop the prison population's growth. The social scientists are attracting attention partly because the drop in crime has made it a less potent political issue, and partly because of the states' financial problems.
State spending on corrections, after adjusting for inflation, has more than tripled in the past three decades, making it the fastest-growing budgetary cost except Medicaid. Even though the prison population has leveled off in the past several years, the costs remain so high that states are being forced to reduce spending in other areas.
Three decades ago, California spent 10 percent of its budget on higher education and 3 percent on prisons. In recent years the prison share of the budget rose above 10 percent while the share for higher education fell below 8 percent. As university administrators in California increase tuition to cover their deficits, they complain that the state spends much more on each prisoner -- nearly $50,000 per year -- than on each student.
Many researchers agree that the rise in imprisonment produced some initial benefits, particularly in urban neighborhoods, where violence decreased significantly in the 1990s. But as sentences lengthened and the prison population kept growing, it included more and more nonviolent criminals like Ms. George.
Half a million people are now in prison or jail for drug offenses, about 10 times the number in 1980, and there have been especially sharp increases in incarceration rates for women and for people over 55, long past the peak age for violent crime. In all, about 1.3 million people, more than half of those behind bars, are in prison or jail for nonviolent offenses.
Researchers note that the policies have done little to stem the flow of illegal drugs. And they say goals like keeping street violence in check could be achieved without the expense of locking up so many criminals for so long.
While many scholars still favor tough treatment for violent offenders, they have begun suggesting alternatives for other criminals. James Q. Wilson, the conservative social scientist whose work in the 1970s helped inspire tougher policies on prison, several years ago recommended diverting more nonviolent drug offenders from prisons to treatment programs.
Two of his collaborators, George L. Kelling of the Manhattan Institute and John J. DiIulio Jr. of the University of Pennsylvania, have joined with prominent scholars and politicians, including Jeb Bush and Newt Gingrich, in a group called Right on Crime. It advocates more selective incarceration and warns that current policies ''have the unintended consequence of hardening nonviolent, low-risk offenders'' so that they become ''a greater risk to the public than when they entered.''
These views are hardly universal, particularly among elected officials worried about a surge in crime if the prison population shrinks. Prosecutors have resisted attempts to change the system, contending that the strict sentences deter crime and induce suspects to cooperate because the penalties provide the police and prosecutors with so much leverage.
Some of the strongest evidence for the benefit of incarceration came from studies by a University of Chicago economist, Steven D. Levitt, who found that penal policies were a major factor in reducing crime during the 1990s. But as crime continued declining and the prison population kept growing, the returns diminished.
''We know that harsher punishments lead to less crime, but we also know that the millionth prisoner we lock up is a lot less dangerous to society than the first guy we lock up,'' Dr. Levitt said. ''In the mid-1990s I concluded that the social benefits approximately equaled the costs of incarceration. Today, my guess is that the costs outweigh the benefits at the margins. I think we should be shrinking the prison population by at least one-third.''
Some social scientists argue that the incarceration rate is now so high that the net effect is ''crimogenic'': creating more crime over the long term by harming the social fabric in communities and permanently damaging the economic prospects of prisoners as well as their families. Nationally, about one in 40 children have a parent in prison. Among black children, one in 15 have a parent in prison.
Cocaine in the Attic
Ms. George was a young single mother when she first got in trouble with drugs and the law. One of her children was fathered by a crack dealer, Michael Dickey, who went to prison in the early 1990s for drug and firearm offenses.
''When he went away, I was at home with the kids struggling to pay bills,'' Ms. George said. ''The only way I knew to get money quick was selling crack. I was never a user, but from being around him I pretty much knew how to get it.''
After the police caught her making crack sales of $40 and $120 -- which were counted as separate felonies -- she was sentenced, at 23, to nine months in a work-release program. That meant working at her mother's hair salon in Pensacola during the day and spending nights at the county jail, away from her three young children.
''When I caught that first charge, it scared me to death,'' she recalled. ''I thought, my God, being away from my kids, this is not what I want. I promised them I would never let it happen again.''
When Mr. Dickey got out of prison in 1995, she said, she refused to resume their relationship, but she did allow him into her apartment sometimes to see their daughter. One evening, shortly after he had arrived, the police showed up with a search warrant and a ladder.
''I didn't know what they were doing with a ladder in a one-story building,'' Ms. George said. ''They went into a closet and opened a little attic space I'd never seen before and brought down the lockbox. He gave them a key to open it. When I saw what was in it, I was so mad I jumped across the table at him and started hitting him.''
Mr. Dickey said he had paid her to store the cocaine at her home. At the trial, other defendants said she was present during drug transactions conducted by Mr. Dickey and other dealers she dated, and sometimes delivered cash or crack for her boyfriends. Ms. George denied those accusations, which her lawyer argued were uncorroborated and self-serving. After the jury convicted her of being part of a conspiracy to distribute cocaine, she told the judge at her sentencing: ''I just want to say I didn't do it. I don't want to be away from my kids.''
Whatever the truth of the testimony against her, it certainly benefited the other defendants. Providing evidence to the prosecution is one of the few ways to avoid a mandatory sentence. Because the government formally credited the other defendants with ''substantial assistance,'' their sentences were all reduced to less than 15 years. Even though Mr. Dickey was the leader of the enterprise and had a much longer criminal record than Ms. George, he was freed five years ago.
Looking back on the case, Judge Vinson said such disparate treatment is unfortunately all too common. The judge, an appointee of President Ronald Reagan who is hardly known for liberalism (last year he ruled that the Obama administration's entire health care act was unconstitutional), says he still regrets the sentence he had to impose on Ms. George because of a formula dictated by the amount of cocaine in the lockbox and her previous criminal record.
''She was not a major participant by any means, but the problem in these cases is that the people who can offer the most help to the government are the most culpable,'' Judge Vinson said recently. ''So they get reduced sentences while the small fry, the little workers who don't have that information, get the mandatory sentences.
''The punishment is supposed to fit the crime, but when a legislative body says this is going to be the sentence no matter what other factors there are, that's draconian in every sense of the word. Mandatory sentences breed injustice.''
Doubts About a Penalty
In the 1980s, stricter penalties for drugs were promoted by Republicans like Mr. Reagan and by urban Democrats worried about the crack epidemic. In the 1990s, both parties supported President Bill Clinton's anticrime bill, which gave states money to build prisons. Three-strikes laws and other formulas forced judges to impose life without parole, a sentence that was uncommon in the United States before the 1970s.
Most other countries do not impose life sentences without parole, and those that do generally reserve it for a few heinous crimes. In England, where it is used only for homicides involving an aggravating factor like child abduction, torture or terrorism, a recent study reported that 41 prisoners were serving life terms without parole. In the United States, some 41,000 are.
''It is unconscionable that we routinely sentence people like Stephanie George to die in our prisons,'' said Mary Price, the general counsel of the advocacy group Families Against Mandatory Minimums. ''The United States is nearly alone among the nations of the world in abandoning our obligation to rehabilitate such offenders.''
The utility of such sentences has been challenged repeatedly by criminologists and economists. Given that criminals are not known for meticulous long-term planning, how much more seriously do they take a life sentence versus 20 years, or 10 years versus 2 years? Studies have failed to find consistent evidence that the prospect of a longer sentence acts as a significantly greater deterrent than a shorter sentence.
Longer sentences undoubtedly keep criminals off the streets. But researchers question whether this incapacitation effect, as it is known, provides enough benefits to justify the costs, especially when drug dealers are involved. Locking up a rapist makes the streets safer by removing one predator, but locking up a low-level drug dealer creates a job opening that is quickly filled because so many candidates are available.
The number of drug offenders behind bars has gone from fewer than 50,000 in 1980 to more than 500,000 today, but that still leaves more than two million people on the street who sell drugs at least occasionally, according to calculations by Peter H. Reuter, a criminologist at the University of Maryland. He and Jonathan P. Caulkins of Carnegie Mellon University say there is no way to lock up enough low-level dealers and couriers to make a significant impact on supply, and that is why cocaine, heroin and other illegal drugs are as readily available today as in 1980, and generally at lower prices.
The researchers say that if the number of drug offenders behind bars was halved -- reduced by 250,000 -- there would be little impact on prices or availability.
''Mandating long sentences based on the quantities of drugs in someone's possession just sweeps up low-level couriers and other hired help who are easily replaced,'' Dr. Caulkins said. ''Instead of relying on formulas written by legislators and sentencing commissions, we should let judges and other local officials use discretion to focus on the dealers who cause the most social harm -- the ones who are violent, who fight for turf on street corners, who employ children. They're the ones who should receive long sentences.''
These changes are starting to be made in places. Sentences for some drug crimes have been eased at the federal level and in states like New York, Kentucky and Texas. Judges in Ohio and South Carolina have been given more sentencing discretion. Californians voted in November to soften their state's ''three strikes'' law to focus only on serious or violent third offenses. The use of parole has been expanded in Louisiana and Mississippi. The United States Supreme Court has banned some life sentences without parole for juvenile offenders.
Nonetheless, the United States, with less than 5 percent of the world's population, still has nearly a quarter of the world's prisoners.
A Mother Taken Away
Ms. George said she could understand the justice of sending her to prison for five years, if only to punish her for her earlier crack-selling offenses.
''I'm a real firm believer in karma -- what goes around comes around,'' she said. ''I see now how wrong it was to sell drugs to people hooked on something they couldn't control. I think, what if they took money away from their kids to buy drugs from me? I deserve to pay a price for that. But my whole life? To take me away from my kids forever?''
When she was sentenced 15 years ago, her children were 5, 6 and 9. They have been raised by her sister, Wendy Evil, who says it was agonizing to take the children to see their mother in prison.
''They would fight to sit on her knee the whole time,'' she recalled recently during a family dinner at their home in Pensacola. ''It's been so hard for them. Some of the troubles they've had are because of their anger at her being gone.''
The youngest child, William, now 20, dropped out of middle school. The older two, Kendra and Courtney, finished high school but so far have not followed their mother's advice to go to college.
''I don't want to blame things on my situation, but I think my life would have been a whole lot different if she'd been here,'' said Courtney, now 25, who has been unemployed for several years. ''When I fell off track, she would have pushed me back. She's way stronger than any of us.''
Ms. George, who has gotten a college degree in prison, calls the children every Sunday. She pays for the calls, which cost 23 cents a minute, with wages from two jobs: a regular eight-hour shift of data processing that pays 92 cents an hour, supplemented by four hours of overtime work at a call center in the prison that provides 411 directory assistance to phone companies.
''I like to stay busy,'' she said during the interview. ''I don't like to give myself time to think about home. I know how much it hurts my daughter to see her friends doing things with their mothers. My boys are still so angry. I thought after a while it would stop, that they'd move on as they got older and had girlfriends. But it just seems like it gets worse every Mother's Day and Christmas.''
She seemed undaunted, even cheerful, during most of the interview at the prison, where she sleeps on a bunk bed in an 11-by-7-foot cell she shares with another inmate. Dressed in the regulation uniform, khaki pants and work boots, she was calm and articulate as she explained her case and the failed efforts to appeal the ruling. At this point lawyers say her only hope seems to be presidential clemency -- rarely granted in recent years -- yet she said she remained hopeful.
She lost her composure only once, while describing the evening in 1996 when the police found the lockbox in her apartment. She had been working in the kitchen, braiding someone's hair for a little money, while Courtney, then 8, played in the home. He watched the police take her away in handcuffs.
''Courtney called out, 'Mom, you promised you weren't going to leave us no more,' '' Ms. George recalled, her eyes glistening. ''I still hear that voice to this day, and he's a grown man.''
Time and Punishment: John Tierney, the Findings columnist for Science Times, is exploring the social science of incarceration. Future articles in this series will look at the effects of current policies on families and communities, and new ideas for dealing with offenders.

HEADLINE: Architect of Wall Street Overhaul Prepares for Life After Politics

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
When a new Congress convenes next month, Wall Street will lose a longtime foe. Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who helped lead a regulatory crackdown after the financial crisis, is retiring after more than 30 years on Capitol Hill.
An unapologetic liberal with a sharp tongue and a knack for financial minutiae, Mr. Frank built a broad legacy as an advocate for affordable housing, an opponent of the death penalty and one of President Bill Clinton's staunchest supporters during impeachment proceedings.
Mr. Frank, who in 1987 became the first sitting member of Congress to volunteer that he was gay, also championed efforts to shield gay people from discrimination - efforts like the repeal of "don't ask, don't tell," the law that banned them from serving openly in the military.
As the chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, Mr. Frank scored a signature legislative victory with the passing of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the financial regulatory law. Passed in response to the crisis, the law reshaped the financial landscape and reined in some of the riskiest corners of Wall Street, including the derivatives market and proprietary trading. 
Now he is ready for a break. Mr. Frank, 72, recently married his longtime partner, Jim Ready. He also shed roughly 25 pounds and hired a book agent. In short, he is counting the seconds until life after politics.
On a recent break from packing up his Washington office, Mr. Frank reflected on his 16-term tenure. The speed-talking congressman, dressed in his usual disheveled manner, discussed his role in the Troubled Asset Relief Program, better known as the bank bailout, the battle over Dodd-Frank and his next career as an author.
The following is an edited excerpt from the interview.
Q.
You are weeks away from leaving. Is the feeling bittersweet? Relief? Both?
A.
Oh, it's mostly relief. I'm just tired. Look, I'm still here, and I still have responsibility. But when the people who work for me or somebody else calls me with a problem, my first reaction is, "Well, do I have to?"
Q.
You come from a blue-collar family in Bayonne, N.J. You hold degrees from Harvard and Harvard Law School. You were a "Freedom Summer" volunteer in 1964. And you've spent nearly 40 years in politics. What's next?
A.
I want to be an active participant in the public debate. In some ways more effectively - I hope - than I've been now. There's an awful skepticism about what we say, those of us who are in elected office. And I expect to say the same things I've been saying, but without them being screened through this, "Oh, you're just doing that to get votes."
Q.
What type of platform are you seeking?
A.
One, I'm going to write a book. I hope to write two. And I've always liked to write. Talking comes easily to me. Writing is harder. And I have an agent and I'm working on a couple of book proposals. At the start, one is a general advocacy piece about liberals and what we should be doing.
Q.
What should liberals do?
A.
First of all, stop trying to ride two horses. Stop trying to push for the expansion of important government programs while joining in the bashing of government. It doesn't work. I think liberals should say, "We think government's a good thing, done right, and we're for expanding it." But then the way you effectuate that, in my judgment, is by a substantial reduction in America's military budget.
During that memorable evening when Clint Eastwood lost a debate to a chair, the one thing he said that was coherent and that got some applause, or a lot of applause, was when he said, "Why don't we pull out of Afghanistan?" I mean, that got kind of lost in the general shambles of that performance. But the Republicans cheered him for saying, well, why don't we just get out altogether? The public's ready to do that.
Q.
What about the second book?
A.
The second book is a history of the gay rights movement.
Q.
How has the environment on Capitol Hill changed for gay lawmakers?
A.
Things have gotten tremendously better. The first thing that brought that about, very simply, was our being honest about who we are. When I started, I was closeted myself. People didn't know any gay or lesbian people, they thought.
I think the country has moved considerably on. Reality has helped. We've had same-sex marriage. We've had gays in the military. So we're on the verge of a total breakthrough.
Q.
Was Dodd-Frank your most significant contribution as a congressman?
A.
I don't like to answer questions like that because you start getting into self-judgments. And when you get into self-judgments, you're either unattractively arrogant, or, literally, incredibly humble.
Q.
O.K., then was Dodd-Frank your hardest-fought battle?
A.
It was. Well, I'm also pleased with the role I played in fighting discrimination based on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender status. Low-income housing was one. But yeah, in terms of legislative achievement, it was a major effort.
Q.
What could you have done better? For example, you've been vocal about your displeasure with the so-called Durbin amendment, the Dodd-Frank rule that limits the amount banks can charge retail shops when a consumer swipes a debit card. And why allow federal regulators to pre-empt state authorities that also oversee the banks?
A.
I would have liked to go further with the pre-emption issue.
In no rational world will you have a separate Securities and Exchange Commission and a Commodity Futures Trading Commission. So that one I would have liked to change. I was sorry that my three Republican friends who voted for the bill did so only after making us take the $20 billion assessment off the banks and financial houses and put it onto the taxpayer.
I'm not a fan of the Durbin amendment. I think that's not going to help the consumer. That was intervening in a fight between two economic groups that should be left to their own.
Q.
Do you also have regrets about your past support for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the housing finance giants that took nearly $200 billion in government bailouts? When the housing market collapsed, they did, too.
A.
I was wrong in thinking that the general housing market would hold up some.
With Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, I did support an increase in their role in affordable rental housing. But by 2005, I saw the need for changes. And the key is, when I became chairman, when I had power, we regulated Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
Q.
You are known for blistering outbursts about your opponents. You once sarcastically said that Newt Gingrich "considers himself one of the intellectual leaders of the free world." Who is currently the most irritating or difficult person in Washington?
A.
Oh, there are obviously several. At this point, the one who I think is the least constructive is Mitch McConnell.
I've felt for some time that if you're going to be in a leadership position, you should have a very safe seat. If you're going to be in a leadership position in a legislative body, you're going to have to do some things that are going to be unpopular.
I'll give an example in my own case. I happened to be the chairman when the need came to stabilize the economy in the face of a banking collapse in a bipartisan way, at the request of the Bush administration. And we did the TARP, the loans to banks.
I think it's going to be clear, TARP will go down historically as the most highly successful, wildly unpopular policy in the history of America. And I lost 14 points in the last election because of it. Fortunately for me, I had a 68 percent majority in 2008. So when I lost 14 points, I still got 54 percent.
Q.
Reflecting back on your Congressional career, what was your favorite moment?
A.
Well, probably the repeal of "Don't ask, don't tell." When that got repealed, both in terms of what it meant for gay people in terms of repealing this libel that there was something the matter with us, and in terms of what it meant for the country, that was a very high moment.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Business Between Worlds

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Wall Street has always been more concept than place. By the late 18th century, a couple of blocks in Lower Manhattan had already become synonymous with stock trading. Later, they became shorthand for the entire American financial system.
But even those broad definitions have become too parochial. In an era of globalization, Wall Street finds itself at the center of the world economy.
It makes for uncertain times. Four years after the financial crisis, the fortunes of Wall Street - and the broader business world - are inextricably tied to myriad issues beyond financiers' control. 
President Obama and Congress are debating tax increases and spending cuts that have implications for companies, consumers and investors. The European debt crisis is smoldering, dimming the region's prospects. The Chinese economy, the global engine of growth, is moderating.
Those macroeconomic conditions are weighing on stocks. In this environment, investors are more interested in the next Federal Reserve Board meeting than the next earnings report from Coca-Cola.
"Policy issues have joined and in many cases overly displaced corporate fundamentals in driving intraday price movements and volatility," said Mohamed El-Erian, the chief executive and co-chief investment officer at Pimco, one of the largest money managers in the world. "Part of this is warranted, as corporate behavior is being influenced by policy uncertainty in a meaningful manner, be it here, China or in Europe."
As lawmakers and policy makers across the globe debate the future, business and financial leaders are trying to influence the decision-making. In the United States alone, companies, trade organizations and consumer advocacy groups have spent more than $2.5 billion this year on lobbying and have deployed an army of 12,000-plus lobbyists, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.
Few issues have captured the attention of business leaders like the so-called fiscal cliff, the combination of spending cuts and tax increases that will take effect at the first of the year barring action in Washington to forestall it. President Obama and Congress face a delicate balancing act as they try to cut the deficit while preserving economic growth.
Everything is on the table in the budget debate. Tax policies. Financial regulation. Health care coverage. Immigration reform. Entitlement benefits. Housing. Education. Energy.
Wall Street and corporate America are increasingly pushing for a "balanced approach," with loud calls for compromise on both sides of the aisle. Support for the Simpson-Bowles proposal - the bipartisan fiscal plan put together in 2010 by the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform headed by Alan Simpson and Erskine Bowles - is resurfacing.
But even as business broadly backs Simpson-Bowles, few executives have read the 65-page document. The details could make a budget bargain difficult.
The banking and real estate industries are hardly expected to support a plan to rethink the home mortgage interest deduction, a core proposal in Simpson-Bowles. Health care companies aren't in favor of capping and eliminating the deduction for employer-provided insurance. The big mutual fund players won't be happy if capital gains and dividends are subject to the same tax as normal income. And military contractors don't want to accept significant cuts to Pentagon spending.
It's all part of the great uncertainty that is paralyzing some businesses. Companies say they're not willing to invest and hire without a clearer picture of public policy. Wall Street banks complain that the new regulations, some yet to be completed, make it difficult to develop a long-term strategy.
For all this sturm und drang, the talk may be harsher than the reality. Businesses have long operated in uncertain times, capitalizing on the weakness to uncover opportunities.
When Ben S. Bernanke wrote his doctoral thesis in 1979, he could have been channeling the quandary that C.E.O.'s face today. "Uncertainty about the long-run environment which is potentially resolvable over time thus exerts a depressing effect on current levels of investment," he wrote at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "Uncertainty provides an incentive to defer such investments in order to wait for new information."
But deferral need not be paralysis. They may complain, but businesses keep running and executives muddle through, if burdened by the weight of diminished expectations.
"You know, all time is uncertain," Warren E. Buffett once said. "I mean, it was uncertain back in 2007; we just didn't know it was uncertain. It was uncertain on Sept. 10, 2001. It was uncertain on Oct. 18, 1987, you just didn't know it. We always live in an uncertain world."
What to expect in the malaise of the months ahead? Little in the way of bold, strategic moves. Look for smaller, more defensive bolt-on deals rather than big, splashy transactions that put companies into new kinds of businesses. Companies will step up hiring and expansion, but only slowly and with caution.
As confidence rebuilds, so should the economy.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Forecasting Wall Street With a Finger in the Wind

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
The consensus outlook on Wall Street is gloomy for the immediate future, with glimmers of optimism for the longer term. This forecast might have been borrowed from Al Sleet, the "Hippy dippy weatherman" created by George Carlin.
Mr. Sleet could not actually predict the weather, but this did not deter him. Despite his manifest shortcomings, he learned how to issue gripping and reliable forecasts, which usually went like this: "Tonight's forecast - dark." Then he would pause, and continue, "Later tonight, continued darkness." Like all good pundits, he also took the long view, adding a hopeful coda: "Turning to partly light in the morning."
That's about where the Wall Street consensus stands now. The short-term outlook is dark, but it will start to clear when the immediate troubles are over.
With a weak economy, flagging corporate earnings and the prospect of a budget impasse in Washington, many investment houses are issuing warnings of impending market turmoil. 
There are "clear and present downside risks to the market in the near term," Goldman Sachs said in a recent report. At Barclays, Barry Knapp, the United States equity strategist, said that such risks were "underappreciated by investors." And Michael Hartnett, chief global equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch, warned that investors were "bipolar" at the moment, lurching between exuberant "risk-on" and depressive "risk-off" moods.
The Treasury market, which has largely held on to the gains of an extraordinarily long bull market in bonds, could benefit if stock investors panic. High demand from safety-seeking investors, combined with the Federal Reserve's aggressive interventions in the bond market, has kept Treasury yields very low, by historical standards, with 10-year notes hovering close to 1.6 percent.
Prices, which move in the opposite direction of yields, have been pinned at very high levels. But the fixed-income rally has been doom-ridden, and isn't likely to be sustained if the economic horizon brightens.
A major economic upturn is not part of mainstream, short-term forecasts. That helps explain why Goldman has been forecasting a year-end close of 1,250 for the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, a substantial 13 percent decline from the index's Monday level of 1,418. And the investment bank expects Treasuries to maintain their rich prices in the near future.
Of course, these are merely probabilities.
It is not really clear where the economy - or stocks, bonds, gold or other asset classes - is heading in the near future. Plenty of analysts say that the major short-term trends are not positive, and that most discernible factors seem likely to weaken the American economy further.
First, the global economy as a whole has been slowing. And the domestic economy is bracing for a painful short-term shock: the dreaded combination of tax increases and spending cuts, also known as the fiscal cliff, that is scheduled to start on Jan. 1.
This would be a self-inflicted blow, which President Obama and Congress can prevent. While they are expected to reach a negotiated agreement, their bargaining could continue until the last minute, creating tumult in the market. However the politics play out, it appears likely that at least some taxes will rise in 2013, that some spending will be cut and that the net economic impact over the short term will be negative.
That uncertainty alone is likely to weigh on the market.
Based on historical precedent, Goldman says that the stock market may endure negative returns in December simply because of the possibility of an increase in the capital gains tax rate in January. The rate is scheduled to rise to 23.8 percent in 2013, including the 3.8 percent tax associated with the Affordable Care Act, from 15 percent now. And the firm is estimating that when the Washington negotiations are over, "spending cuts and expiring policies will create a $233 billion fiscal headwind in 2013."
Mr. Knapp of Barclays put it this way: "It seems unlikely the tax cliff negotiations will produce a comprehensive solution that will significantly reduce the macroeconomic risks related to fiscal and monetary policy for 2013, at least not without the markets falling sharply and forcing compromise. In other words, these risks should linger into 2013."
Goldman says that fiscal tightening is likely to hurt consumer discretionary stocks, particularly autos, consumer electronics, home furnishings and home improvement companies. Consumer-oriented companies like drugstores, food and tobacco companies could better weather the turbulent conditions.
Over all, Goldman favors energy and information technology companies. And while it is decidedly gloomy for the short term, the investment bank is quite bullish through 2013, with an S.& P. 500 target of 1,575 at the end of the year.
After so much darkness, where might this light be coming from?
First, American companies continue to gush profits, even if their growth rates are slowing. Consensus earnings-growth expectations for the S.& P. 500 for the fourth quarter dropped to 4.7 percent on Dec. 3, from 9.8 percent on Oct. 8. Still, Goldman estimates that earnings per share in the S.& P. 500 will amount to $100 in 2012, rising to $107 to $114 a share in 2013. This, combined with a moderately successful resolution of the nation's short-term fiscal problems, could propel the market upward.
Underlying the strength of the stock market are two related factors. One is the low cost of corporate borrowing, which is helping to keep profit margins high. The other is the near-zero yield on money market funds, which, if only by contrast, makes stocks relatively attractive.
Behind these ultralow interest rates is the accommodative policy of the Federal Reserve. The central bank was likely to reiterate on Wednesday that it would continue this policy well into 2015, or even after the economy begins to strengthen, whenever that may be. Low mortgage rates appear to be reviving the long-moribund housing market, an important pillar of the domestic economy.
The policy of the Fed, and similarly expansionary monetary policies by other central banks, is bound to keep the price of gold high, in the view of many analysts.
But unexpected shocks could alarm stock investors. Should Washington fail to reach an agreement in the fiscal negotiations, the markets could plummet. "I think we'd see a return to extreme volatility," said John Linehan, director of United States equities for T. Rowe Price, the mutual fund firm. And a heightened crisis in the European Union - or in the Middle East or any other important region - could derail the American profit machine.
For some certainty in the market, the best option is to follow the final and still operative forecast of Mr. Sleet. "The weather will continue to change on and off for a long, long time," he said, before departing the prediction business at the top of his game.
Enjoy the sunshine when it arrives, he suggested, but be prepared for periodic bouts of darkness. Investors could find worse advice.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Federal Regulators Stay on the Full-Court Press

BYLINE: By PETER J. HENNING. 
Peter J. Henning, a professor at Wayne State University Law School, is the author of ''The Prosecution and Defense of Public Corruption: The Law & Legal Strategies.'' Twitter: @peterjhenning

 BODY:
It has become the era of the star prosecutor in white-collar crime.
Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan who is closely identified with a string of prominent insider trading cases, was on the cover of Time magazine in February. This fall, he even got a shout-out from Bruce Springsteen during a concert.
Robert S. Khuzami, head of the enforcement division of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is being considered for the chairmanship of the agency. That may be Wall Street's worst nightmare. Goldman Sachs, for one, knows Mr. Khuzami's aggressive approach, considering that he headed up the case that led the company to reach a $550 million settlement over a security tied to bad mortgages.
Although some have been critical, saying that not enough criminal actions have been filed since the financial crisis, the Justice Department and the S.E.C. have been fierce in their prosecution of other white-collar crimes. That assertive tone is not likely to change over the next four years under President Obama. 
With that in mind, three areas are likely to receive special attention: hedge funds, cases involving whistle-blowers and investigations into foreign bribery and corruption.
HEDGE FUNDS A TARGET Hedge funds long operated largely free from regulation by the S.E.C. The Dodd-Frank Act changed that for larger funds, which now have to register as investment advisers and strengthen compliance and internal controls, all at much greater cost.
The S.E.C.'s enforcement division created an asset management unit in 2010 to focus on hedge funds, and it has started filing cases against firms over what the agency views as aberrational financial performance. In October, it filed a lawsuit against Yorkville Advisors and two of its executives, claiming that they had overvalued assets and exaggerated returns to hide losses and increase their fees.
A greater concern may be the crackdown on insider trading and how it could affect hedge funds, especially those that trade individual stocks. A big focus appears to be SAC Capital Advisors and its founder, Steven A. Cohen.
Prosecutors filed charges recently against Mathew Martoma, a former portfolio manager at SAC Capital, accusing him of using confidential information about two pharmaceutical companies that allowed the firm to reap profits and avoid losses totaling about $276 million. That would make it among the most lucrative insider trading cases.
Neither Mr. Cohen nor SAC Capital is named in the criminal complaint, but the firm said that the S.E.C. was considering filing civil charges under a rarely used provision of federal securities law that authorizes a case against a so-called controlling person, like an employer or other organization that directs the actions of another.
In 1988, Congress adopted the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act to allow the S.E.C. to seek a penalty of up to three times the gain or loss avoided when a controlling person knowingly or recklessly failed to "establish, maintain or enforce any policy or procedure" designed to prevent insider trading.
The charges against Mr. Martoma are not the first against someone who worked at SAC Capital, and the S.E.C. may take aim at the firm over failing to police its portfolio managers properly.
Hedge funds were hardly a blip on the radar when the statute was enacted, but they are now potential targets if the S.E.C. believes that they tolerated insider trading, regardless of whether managers knew of or participated in the violations.
WHISTLE-BLOWERS WELCOME The federal government has embraced whistle-blowing as a means of gathering information. With substantial rewards for successful cases, more corporate employees are likely to turn over information about their companies. That also means that the eye-popping awards will continue to resemble lottery jackpots.
Under a 2006 law, the Internal Revenue Service gave its first whistle-blower reward, $104 million, this year to Bradley Birkenfeld for providing information about tax evasion through secret Swiss bank accounts at UBS. At the time of the award, Mr. Birkenfeld was finishing a prison sentence for his role in aiding a bank client's tax evasion, but that did not prevent him from getting a slice of the I.R.S. recovery of unpaid taxes.
His disclosures were crucial to peeling back the veil of Swiss bank secrecy. The government is more than happy to reward even those who participate in wrongdoing when it leads to bigger players.
The S.E.C. has become a major benefactor to whistle-blowers under a provision of the Dodd-Frank Act that requires it to pay at least 10 percent, and as much as 30 percent, of any penalty of over $1 million for information that helps to prove a violation.
In a recent report, the S.E.C. said it had received 3,001 tips in the 2012 fiscal year, the program's first full year of operation. And it has amassed over $450 million in an account designated to reward whistle-blowers.
So don't expect the S.E.C. and other agencies to shy away from relying on corporate employees and others to bring violations to their attention.
THE AGE OF OVERSEAS BRIBERY If there is one area that epitomizes the Justice Department's aggressive approach toward global companies, it is its enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The law, passed in the post-Watergate era to deter the payment of bribes to foreign officials to obtain business, has become a scourge for companies caught up in an investigation because of the enormous costs of cooperating with the government.
A prime example is Wal-Mart, which responded to a New York Times report of potential bribery in its Mexican subsidiary by undertaking a global review of its operations. The company recently reported that it had expanded its internal investigation to cover operations in Brazil, China and India. Executives in its joint venture in India were suspended because of possibly illicit payments.
The internal inquiry has cost Wal-Mart $99 million so far this year, paid mostly to lawyers and accountants. Those costs will grow as the inquiry expands, and could surpass $250 million before the company works out a settlement with the Justice Department and the S.E.C.
In a recent speech, Lanny A. Breuer, the head of the Justice Department's criminal division, said that enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act had "become part of the fabric" of the department and that the law was "now a reality that companies know they must live with and adjust to."
That adjustment can mean millions of dollars if there is a realistic possibility of foreign bribery made on behalf of a company with global operations.
These cases only scratch the surface of what we are likely to see in the headlines. The aggressive approach of the Justice Department, S.E.C. and other agencies will result in more headaches for Wall Street and corporate America as new ways of breaking the law come to light.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Unlikely Backers In a Battle Over Taxes

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and JONATHAN WEISMAN; Catherine Rampell contributed reporting.

 BODY:
A broad swath of the nation's leading chief executives dropped its opposition to tax increases on the wealthiest Americans on Tuesday, while the White House quietly pressed Wall Street titans for their support as well.
Before Tuesday's about-face, the Business Roundtable had insisted that the White House extend Bush-era tax cuts to taxpayers of all income brackets, but the executives' resistance crumbled as pressure builds to find a compromise for the fiscal impasse in Washington before the end of the year.
''We recognize that part of the solution has to be tax increases,'' David M. Cote, chief executive of Honeywell, said on a conference call with reporters. ''That's the only thing that allows a reasonable compromise to be reached.''
Even as the Fortune 500 leaders announced their shift, the White House continued to work behind the scenes to woo some of Wall Street's most powerful financiers -- a group that had largely abandoned President Obama in his bid for a second term after supporting him in 2008. 
After seeking out corporate leaders from industrial companies last month, the White House has intensified outreach to Wall Street in December.
On Wednesday, several hedge fund managers, including Daniel Och, the billionaire founder of Och-Ziff Capital Management, will meet with Valerie Jarrett, a top adviser to the president, and members of the White House economic team.
Last Monday, White House officials sat down with a more than half a dozen top bankers and financiers, including Gary D. Cohn, president of Goldman Sachs, and Greg Fleming, head of wealth management at Morgan Stanley.
The differing strategies -- highly public meetings with corporate America and private arm-twisting with Wall Street -- both appear to be aimed at winning popular support for higher taxes on the wealthy. The trade-offs being roundly fought over in Washington, like what government programs may be cut and which entitlements may be spared, are less important in this effort to muster highly compensated chieftains whose support for tax increases will provide cover for Congressional Republicans wary of being seen as too quick to compromise on higher tax rates.
What's more, the political symbolism of some of the wealthiest Americans' saying they support higher taxes on the rich takes a bit of the sting out of the idea of raising rates, for both Democrats and Republicans. Indeed, by appealing to both camps and enlisting their support, President Obama hopes to neutralize potential critics, according to allies of the president on Wall Street.
President Obama's supporters cited the example of Frederick W. Smith, the chief executive of FedEx. Last week, Mr. Smith signaled he was not angered by higher tax rates for the wealthiest individuals, a centerpiece of President Obama's plan to reduce the deficit and a key sticking point for Republicans in Congress.
''If people who didn't support the president believe the president is acting reasonably, they're going to put pressure on the other side,'' said Marc Lasry, a longtime supporter of the president who runs Avenue Capital. ''You need both sides to be reasonable.''
For example, Mr. Lasry invited the real estate tycoon Barry Sternlicht, a onetime Obama supporter who raised money for Mitt Romney in the last election cycle, to the White House last week. Mr. Lasry, who has $13 billion under management, including $1.3 billion of his own money, is among a small group of Wall Street figures who stuck with the president before the election, even as those like Mr. Sternlicht deserted him.
This core group met with President Obama on Nov. 16, and included Tony James, president of the Blackstone Group, as well as Roger Altman, a Democratic stalwart who is executive chairman of Evercore Partners, and Robert Wolf, a longtime UBS executive who recently began his own firm, 32 Advisors.
Also in attendance were Blair W. Effron, co-founder of Centerview Partners, and Mark T. Gallogly, a Blackstone veteran who founded Centerbridge Partners in 2005.
To be sure, most executives genuinely fear the consequences of the automatic spending cuts and tax increases if a compromise is not found by Jan. 1, but the efforts by big business to press politicians in Washington could also pay large dividends in the future.
While most business leaders now say they are willing to support increases in tax rates for individuals as well as cuts in entitlement spending, their stance in favor of lower corporate tax rates could actually benefit their bottom lines in the long run.
For now, however, the focus is on reaching a deal by end of the year rather than a broad tax overhaul. At the White House, the outreach effort is being led by Ms. Jarrett, and she has been joined in the meetings with executives and bankers by Timothy F. Geithner, the secretary of the Treasury; Jeffrey Zients, the head of the Office of Management and Budget; and Gene Sperling, director of the National Economic Council.
The White House arranged calls on Dec. 3 and on Monday for chief executives who attended the earlier sessions with the president, updating them on the negotiations and reiterating the need for their support. Among the participants were Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs; Randall Stephenson, the chief executive of AT&T, and Marriott's chief executive, Arne Sorenson.
Some chief executives, like Mr. Blankfein, who have been relatively outspoken in recent weeks about the need for tax increases, are viewed as relative liberals in the business community.
But others who reversed course Tuesday, like Doug Oberhelman of Caterpillar, are seen as more conservative politically and suggest an important shift in the political landscape in terms of tax policy.
Another more conservative executive who signed a letter to Congress and the president from the Business Roundtable was Rex W. Tillerson, the chief executive of Exxon.
''Compromise will require Congress to agree on more revenue -- whether by increasing rates, eliminating deductions, or some combination thereof -- and the administration to agree to larger, meaningful structural and benefit entitlement reforms and spending reductions that are a fiscally responsible multiple of increased revenues,'' said the letter, signed by more than 100 chief executives.
Besides Mr. Cote, several other prominent chiefs joined the call with reporters organized by the Business Roundtable, including Andrew N. Liveris of Dow Chemical, Jeffrey R. Immelt of G.E. and Alexander Cutler of Eaton.
Small businesses also appear anxious about the fiscal impasse. On Tuesday, the National Federation of Independent Business reported that its Small Business Optimism Index had one of its steepest declines ever in November.
The net percentage of business owners who said they expected better economic conditions in six months -- that is, the share that expected improvement minus the share that expected deterioration -- was negative 35 percent. That is the worst outlook since the federation began collecting this data on a monthly basis in 1986.
Bill Dunkelberg, the chief economist at the federation, attributed the pessimism to the stalemate in Washington, higher health care costs and ''the endless onslaught of new regulations.''

HEADLINE: Invitation to a Dialogue: Imagine a New Party

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Just because third parties haven't made inroads in presidential elections doesn't mean there is no place for them in American politics. A pragmatic progressive third party would recognize that a presidential bid is futile and would strive to elect representatives and senators who could caucus with the Democrats. This would push the Democrats to the left the way the Tea Party now pushes the Republicans to the right. Here are a few parties worth imagining: 
The Occupy Party. There is something nostalgically charming about a revival of the idealistic but politically impotent theatrics of the 1960s left, as these days almost all the crazy people are on the right. But the Tea Party is a political force, and the Occupy movement is not, because the Tea Party backs candidates. Stop occupying the streets and start occupying the Capitol.
The Realitarians. Realitarians base their conclusions on facts and valid arguments, regardless of where they sit on the political spectrum. Stephen Colbert was largely correct when he said that reality has a liberal bias. But not always. A Realitarian would reject Obamacare's reliance on the private sector because free market forces in the health care market always drive the price up. It doesn't matter why; it's a fact. Realitarians would also acknowledge politically incorrect facts about radiation, genetically modified organisms, Palestine and so on, regardless of where they sit on the political spectrum.
The Homestead Party. America took off economically in 1870 because those people who could not borrow money from parents were given ''gifts'' of land by the government. This created something like a level playing field for everyone, rich or poor. What we had approximated, to put it in Representative Paul D. Ryan's terms, was equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome. The way we can create comparable opportunities in the modern world is for government to create an infrastructure that makes education and capital available to everyone, then gets out of the way.
Let's hear readers' ideas for new parties to broaden the political spectrum.

HEADLINE: That Crush at Kosovo's Business Door? The Return of U.S. Heroes

BYLINE: By MATTHEW BRUNWASSER

 BODY:
PRISTINA, Kosovo -- Prime Minister Hashim Thaci is in a bind. His country's largest and most lucrative enterprise, the state telecommunications company, is up for sale. The jostling among buyers is intense. Narrowing the bidders has hardly helped.
One bid is from a fund founded by former Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright. Lobbying for another was James W. Pardew, the Clinton-era special envoy to the Balkans. Both former diplomats are among the Americans who hold the status of heroes here for their roles in the 1999 intervention that separated Kosovo from Serbia and created one of the world's newest states.
In a meeting with Mr. Pardew in October, the prime minister explained his ''difficult position'' in having to choose between the buyers, according to a memo leaked to the newspaper Zeri, ''because whichever of the two bidders behind them wins, he will be seen by 2 million people to have betrayed the other one.''
So many former American officials have returned to Kosovo for business -- in coal and telecommunications, or for lobbying and other lucrative government contracts -- that it is hard to keep them from colliding. 
They also include Wesley K. Clark, a retired Army general and the former supreme allied commander of NATO forces in Europe who ran the bombing campaign against the Serbian strongman Slobodan Milosevic; and Mark Tavlarides, who was legislative director at the Clinton White House's National Security Council.
The State Department has no policy that forbids former diplomats to lobby on behalf of nations where they served or returning to them for profit, beyond the one applying to federal employees as a whole, which prohibits senior officials from contacting agencies where they once worked for one year and bans all federal employees for life from advising on the same matters.
Kosovo is not the only nation where former officials have returned to conduct business -- Iraq is another example -- but it presents an extreme case, and perhaps a special ethical quandary, given the outsize American influence here. Pristina, the capital, may be the only city in the world where Bob Dole Street intersects Bill Clinton Boulevard.
Foreign policy experts say the practice of former officials' returning for business is more common than acknowledged publicly. Privately, former officials concede the possibility of conflicts of interest and even the potential to influence American foreign policy as diplomats who traditionally made careers in public service now rotate more frequently to lucrative jobs in the private sector.
Asked for comment, former officials involved said their business dealings with the Kosovo government would benefit Kosovars by building a more prosperous economy. ''We're going to employ people, provide training, create exports and help the country grow and develop as a democracy,'' said General Clark, who is chairman of Envidity, a Canadian energy company seeking to explore Kosovo's lignite coal deposits and produce synthetic fuel.
Lawrence Lessig, a law professor and director of the Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics at Harvard, said the appearance of ''cashing in'' risked undermining the prestige of the United States by clouding the humanitarian nature of the 1999 intervention, which was aimed at ending Serbian atrocities against Kosovars.
After the separation, Kosovo was an international protectorate run by thousands of officials from other countries and the United Nations serving as government representatives and private contractors. Four years of internationally ''supervised independence'' ended in September. About 6,000 peacekeepers remain.
The closeness of the ties between the state-builders and the state they built has made it easy for officials to change hats. Though the country is one of Europe's poorest, there is still the potential for profit, particularly as the government privatizes critical assets.
Albright Capital Management, founded by Ms. Albright, has been shortlisted in the bidding for a 75 percent share in the state telecommunications company, PTK. The company's sale is expected to bring in between $400 million and $800 million.
Senior executives of a sister company, Albright Stonebridge Group, are already small shareholders in PTK's only competitor, the private company IPKO, raising concerns on the threat to market competition if Ms. Albright's consortium wins the bid.
Mr. Pardew, the former American envoy, lobbied top Kosovo officials on behalf of a competing consortium, Twelve Hornbeams S.a.r.l /Avicenna Capital LLC.
The memo on the prime minister's meeting with Mr. Pardew, from within the consortium, was leaked by someone unhappy with the running of the tender process. The choice of Mr. Pardew as their emissary was ''vitally important,'' the memo noted, because Kosovo's elite ''know and love him for his role on the ground during the war.''
After the memo became public, Mr. Pardew withdrew from lobbying for the consortium, and he declined to comment. It is still possible that neither of the American-backed bidders will win the tender, which is expected to be decided in January.
Ms. Albright responded to an interview request with a statement. Citing limits to disclosure during the tender process, the statement from Nelson Oliveira, managing director and general counsel of Albright Capital Management, read in part, ''We take seriously all of our obligations -- legal and ethical, in this and all other potential investments.''
''We believe that a transparent, well managed privatization of the state-owned telecom company should bring substantial benefits to the economy and people of Kosovo,'' the statement added.
Kosovo's government denied that any of the former diplomats got special treatment. ''I hope they will make money in Kosovo and that Kosovo will make money from their investments,'' said Deputy Foreign Minister Petrit Selimi. ''The Kosovo government will not choose a company just because it's American.''
Telecommunications in Kosovo can be a rough business. In 2007, gunmen tried -- first with firearms, then with a mortar attack on his car -- to kill Anton Berisha, the head of the telecommunications regulatory agency. He survived both attempts, which took place not long after he awarded Kosovo's second cellphone license to the Slovenian-owned IPKO. A year later, he became ambassador to Slovenia.
In 2004, Ms. Albright became a special adviser to the chairman of the board of IPKO, Akan Ismaili, who is now Kosovo's ambassador to the United States.
The telecommunications deal is just one of many that Americans have angled for. The biggest infrastructure project in Kosovo's post-Yugoslav history, a 63-mile stretch of highway connecting Pristina to the Albanian border, was awarded in 2010 to Bechtel of San Francisco in a joint venture with a Turkish company, Enka.
At the time, the prime minister estimated the deal at $1 billion.
Bechtel had help getting the contract from Mr. Tavlarides, the legislative director at the National Security Council during the 1999 Kosovo intervention. According to a lobbying report filed with the United States government, Mr. Tavlarides lobbied on behalf of Bechtel in Kosovo on ''highway-related issues'' while working for Van Scoyoc Associates, a Washington-based lobbying firm.
Mr. Tavlarides now works at the Podesta Group, which signed a $50,000 monthly contract with the Kosovo government on Jan. 1, advising it on communications and strengthening Kosovo's ties to the United States government. The Podesta Group was co-founded as Podesta Associates by John Podesta, White House chief of staff in Mr. Clinton's second term. Mr. Podesta left the firm in 1993. It is still owned by his brother, Anthony.
Mr. Tavlarides declined to comment, citing his firm's policy to not speak with the news media about clients.
For his part, General Clark said it was ''insulting'' to suggest that there could be any conflict between private profit-making and his past responsibilities. ''My business is aboveboard, transparent and helps the Kosovar people,'' he said. ''We are going to use a resource that had no value to the Kosovo people and bring in hundreds of millions of dollars of investment.''
United States military officers have a one-year post-retirement ban on contacting their former armed service about official matters, and a lifetime ban on any contacts related to the same matters on which they worked, according to the Pentagon.
Watchdog groups raise the possibility that Kosovo's government might see doing business with former American officials as a conduit to the current United States administration. They also fear that the influence of former officials diminishes competition and hurts consumers.
The appearance of an inside track by some companies had discouraged competitors ''because they know the game is set,'' said Avni Zogiani, a Kosovar journalist who heads Cohu, an anticorruption organization in Pristina that has investigated the links between the telecommunications business, crime and politics. ''There is no interest in investing in Kosovo by reputable companies anymore.''
Even some former officials acknowledge discomfort at the extent of the interplay between dealing and diplomacy.
Steven P. Schook, a retired United States army brigadier general and former chief of staff of KFOR, NATO's force in Kosovo, said he had ''mixed feelings'' about it.
Mr. Schook, who also served as the deputy head of the United Nations mission in Kosovo, has returned as a private consultant for former Prime Minister Ramush Haradinaj, who was acquitted last month by the war crimes tribunal in The Hague. He says that he works for Mr. Haradinaj because of a belief in his leadership and that his only compensation is his expenses living in Kosovo, about $2,600 a month.
''There are a lot of ex-diplomats coming in and out that are now representing private interests,'' he said. ''If I'm a large corporation and I want to get in to be competitive, I want to work with people to help me do that.''
''But on the other hand, it seems a bit tawdry,'' Mr. Schook added. ''One minute you're liberating a place, and the next minute you're trying to get an energy tender.''

HEADLINE: Should Engineers Pay Less for College Than English Majors?

BYLINE: KATHERINE SCHULTEN


HIGHLIGHT: Do you think the system Florida's governor has proposed is fair? Is it a good idea? Is studying the humanities worthwhile even if those majors are not as in demand for jobs? 

 BODY:
 Should students majoring in engineering, science, health care or technology - all fields in demand in the job market - have to pay less for college than those majoring in history, philosophy, anthropology or English? The governor of Florida says he thinks so, at least at Florida's 12 state universities. 
Read an article about this proposal, then tell us how you feel about this idea. What do you plan to major in? Why?
In "Florida May Reduce Tuition for Select Majors," Lizette Alvarez writes: 
Rick Scott, businessman turned politician, campaigned for governor in 2010 with promises to run Florida like a successful business - more efficiency, lower costs, less hand-wringing and measurable results. 
 Now, looking for more value on the remaining dollars, Governor Scott and Republican lawmakers are prodding Florida's 12 state universities to find ways to steer students toward majors that are in demand in the job market.
The message from Tallahassee could not be blunter: Give us engineers, scientists, health care specialists and technology experts. Do not worry so much about historians, philosophers, anthropologists and English majors.
To nudge students toward job-friendly degrees, the governor's task force on higher education suggested recently that university tuition rates be frozen for three years for majors in "strategic areas," which would vary depending on supply and demand. An undergraduate student would pay less for a degree in engineering or biotechnology - whose classes are among the most expensive for universities - than for a degree in history or psychology. State financing, which has dropped drastically in the past five years, would be expected to make up the tuition gap. 
 Students: Tell us ...

        
Do you think a system like this would nudge students toward "job-friendly" degrees in high-need areas like technology and science?
        
Do you think this system is fair? Do you think it is a good idea?
        
Do you think studying the humanities- the arts, English and history - is worthwhile, even if those majors are not as in demand for jobs? Why or why not?
        
Do you agree with the governor that, during a time when generous state financing for higher education is no longer an option and jobs are scarce, universities need to be practical about the value of their degrees and evolve with the economy?
        
What do you plan to major in? Why? How "job friendly" do you think that major is? What do you plan to do with it after college?

HEADLINE: Barclays Names Former British Regulator as Head of Compliance

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: After a rate-rigging scandal, Barclays has appointed Hector Sants, a former chief of Britain's Financial Services Authority, as its head of compliance. 

 BODY:
LONDON - Barclays appointed Hector Sants, Britain's former top financial regulator, as head of compliance on Wednesday, as part of an effort to repair the bank's image after a rate-rigging scandal. 
With the appointment of Mr. Sants, who is also a former UBS investment banker, Barclays hopes to benefit from his experience working with many of the world's financial regulators. Mr. Sants stepped down as chief executive of the British regulator, the Financial Services Authority, in June.
That same month, Barclays agreed to a $450 million settlement with American and British authorities over charges that some of its traders reported false interest rates for financial gain. The case led to the resignation of several top executives, including Robert E. Diamond Jr., the bank's chief.
The scandal also prompted questions about the role of the Financial Services Authority in policing big banks. In 2008, a Barclays employee told the authority that the bank was lowering its submissions for the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, although Barclays never specifically said the activities amounted to manipulation.
Since the summer, Barclays has moved to rethink its compliance and risk-taking activities. It has begun a review of its risky trading operations and was expected to announce an overhaul of many of its business units in time for its next earnings statement in February.
As head of compliance and government and regulatory relations, Mr. Sants will oversee compliance across all of the bank's operations and report directly to the chief executive, Antony P. Jenkins. He will start at the beginning of 2013.
"Relationships with our regulators and governments around the world are obviously also of critical importance to us," Mr. Jenkins said in a statement on Wednesday. "We must apply a renewed leadership focus on these to make them as constructive and productive as possible."
The Financial Services Authority has faced harsh criticism from British politicians, who said it did not do enough to monitor risky trading activity in London's financial services sector.
In tense testimony before Parliament this year, Adair Turner, the former chairman of the authority, was questioned about the culture at Barclays that led to the rate-rigging scandal.
In April, Mr. Turner had written to Marcus Agius, then the chairman of Barclays, about what the regulator perceived as overly aggressive practices by the bank. The concerns focused on efforts to avoid paying about $770 million in corporate taxes and on some of the bank's accounting methods.
"Barclays often seems to be seeking to gain advantage through the use of complex structures, or through regulatory approaches which are at the aggressive end of interpretation of the relevant rules and regulations," Mr. Turner wrote, according to documents released by Parliament.
Mr. Sants did raise early concerns about the culture at Barclays. After Mr. Diamond was appointed as the bank's chief executive, the authority warned the Barclays board that he had "not reached the level of openness, transparency and willingness to air issues" with regulators, according to an e-mail.
An earlier version of this post misstated Hector Sants's new job title. He will be head of compliance and government and regulatory relations, not regulatory regulations.

HEADLINE: Moving Forward in Tough Times

BYLINE: DAVID BORNSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: A look at more than 30 social initiatives covered in Fixes this year shows that working to improve and save lives is still a growth industry. 

 BODY:
Welcome to the second annual Fixes holiday season retrospective! Almost every week, over the past two years, we've covered a response to a social problem that's noteworthy, usually because it's producing better than expected results. We highlight these "positive deviants" because 1) they're under-reported; 2) they show society not just what's going wrong but how it might improve; and 3) they're inherently interesting, like a good puzzle or whodunit. Because we get more leads than we can cover, we typically focus on initiatives that have a track record, evidence of effectiveness and potential for broader impact.
So, last week, I reached out to three dozen organizations we've covered to find out how they had fared during the past year. Even during this difficult economic period, I was struck by how many had augmented their work. It seems that, while we've been occupied with the economy, the election and Gangnam Style, some interesting changes have occurred under the radar. Here's a roundup for 2012:
 EDUCATION 
On the education front, a number of groups have gained traction addressing this challenge: How can we nurture the social and emotional development of children? Roots of Empathy, which brings moms and babies into thousands of classrooms and builds empathetic capacity among children, expanded its work to Europe and the United States and saw its influence shape educational policies in Canadian provinces. Playworks, which shows schools how to improve recess, underwent a randomized controlled trial, and preliminary results indicate that its play-based program significantly reduces bullying, exclusionary behavior and class conflicts (teachers report that students take 27 percent less time transitioning from recess to learning activities). The Positive Coaching Alliance, which helps coaches teach character-building lessons through youth sports, now reports that it is reaching a million youths. (Check out P.C.A.'s free online e-Talking Points for coaches.) 
A number of groups have been advancing changes in curriculum. The music program, Little Kids Rock, which seeks to institutionalize "modern band" as a "fifth stream" in music education, is ramping up its work fivefold in public schools in New York City and Los Angeles. JUMP Math, a math curriculum that has demonstrated impressive learning gains in Canada and England, is being piloted in California, Washington State and New York City and is being adapted to the American Common Core State Standards. And following its positive results at the Bea Fuller Rodgers middle school in Washington Heights, CFY will be expanding its blended learning model to 10 schools in four cities.
 HEALTH 
In the field of health, we've seen compelling examples of the benefits of prevention and early action. This past April, my colleague Tina Rosenberg reported on a partnership between the International Center for Diarrheal Disease Research, Bangladesh, the world experts on cholera, and AmeriCares, an aid group that airlifts medical supplies to disaster zones, to deploy a top-speed global response to cholera outbreaks. Shortly thereafter, the model was tested in Sierra Leone, Kenya and Somalia, and it has been credited with preventing a significant number of deaths.
In the United States, the Nurse-Family Partnership, which pairs vulnerable first-time pregnant women with nurses early in their pregnancies - producing positive long-term health and social outcomes for mothers and children - is now working in 42 states, up from 37. Text4Baby, which sends informational text messages to pregnant women and new moms, has been used by 460,000 women. In one study, 75 percent reported that the messages informed them of medical warning sign they didn't know about. Health Leads' work mobilizing student volunteers to address the social conditions underlying illnesses is gradually being integrated into hospital systems, with close to half of its clients in 2012 referred by a healthcare provider or via electronic medical records. After a Health Leads co-founder, Rebecca Onie, gave a TED talk in April, the organization received 545 requests for expansion.
 SOCIAL ENTERPRISE 
Social enterprises are also making headway. First Book, which distributed its 100 millionth book in 2012, saw sales from its deeply discounted Marketplace grow to nearly three million books, aggregated from 45,000 classrooms and reading programs. Root Capital extended $130 million in loans during the year to agricultural businesses employing a quarter of a million small-scale farming families; a third of the funds went to "gender inclusive" businesses that provide livelihoods for 64,000 women. (Targeting resources to women producers is critical to reduce global hunger, notes the Food and Agriculture Organization.)
Tina Rosenberg reported on a business model developed by Manna Energy andVestergaard Frandsen to distribute water filters to 4.5 million people in Western Kenya, using carbon credit financing. The initiative appears to have significantly decreased water-borne illnesses and averted many children's deaths. 
Husk Power's business in Bihar, India, producing inexpensive electricity from discarded rice husks for villagers received $5 million in equity financing. And the for-benefit B Corporation model, which Tina reported on, is taking off: 650 companies in 20 countries have gone through certification, and 12 states, including New York and California, have legally approved this corporate structure. But major adoption in the United States hinges on Delaware coming on board.
 ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY 
In the area of economic opportunity, Specialisterne, from Denmark, a company and associated foundation that trains people with autism spectrum disorders and helps them gain employment, has expanded its work to 12 countries, including the United States, where state leaders in Delaware have championed the model. Year Up, a vocational development program that prepares youths from low-income communities for careers in major companies, launched partnerships with Baltimore City Community College and Miami Dade College, as part of a plan to integrate its methodology into the community college system. Alison, the free online job skills training site, reports that its traffic tripled since June, reaching two million visitors per month.
The Freelancers Union and Freelancers Insurance Company (F.I.C.) had perhaps the biggest leap forward in 2012. In addition to robust growth of their membership and customer base, the Freelancers Union was awarded $340 million in federal loans through the Affordable Care Act to launch nonprofit, consumer-governed health plans in New York, New Jersey and Oregon in 2014. In November, the F.I.C. also established its own medical practice in downtown Brooklyn, offering medical care, yoga, meditation and other services (without co-pays). Within a month, 1,500 members had signed up.
 OTHER INITIATIVES 
In other areas, the Myelin Repair Foundation opened its own translational medicine center to accelerate the evaluation of potential therapies for multiple sclerosis.Youth Villages continues to see its home-based alternative to residential treatment or foster care gain momentum. The organization expanded to Oregon and Indiana in 2012. And the federal government extended theTitle IV-E Child Welfare Waiver to nine additional states, giving them flexibility to experiment with this approach. The standardized labels being advanced by Recycle Across America are now used in all public schools in Washington, D.C., and San Diego. (San Diego officials hope to save $200,000 in trash hauling costs.)
The "collective impact" educational model, led by the Strive Cradle to Career Network, has spread to 80 communities and five countries, including Malaysia, which aims to institute it at a national level. The 100,000 homes campaign led by Community Solutions, which both Tina and I have reported on, has led to more than 23,000 formerly chronically homeless people receiving housing - including more than 5,000 veterans. LIFT, which mobilizes student volunteers to help vulnerable people obtain social services, grew by more than 20 percent this year. The organization recently conducted a simulation in which middle-class professionals were asked to navigate government systems to obtain housing, employment and other services. (See this video.) It gave participants a deep appreciation for the indignities that poor people experience every day.
 A TRIBUTE TO A LEADER 
I'd like to end with a note about Inez Killingsworth, the president of ESOP, a Cleveland-headquartered organization that has led the way in Ohio fighting to help homeowners avoid foreclosure. I recently learned that Killingsworth, 74, is undergoing hospice care, in the final stages of cancer, and it led me to reflect on her remarkable journey.
Killingsworth, the daughter of Mississippi sharecroppers, moved to the Union-Miles area of Cleveland in 1959 after she was married. Officially, she was a school janitor. Unofficially, she was the person everybody from the principal to the custodian to the students turned to when they needed help. After she retired, she discovered that she had a knack for community organizing. She began by getting the city to catch the stray dogs that were terrorizing neighborhood children, then she fought for public school improvements, pressured police to close drug houses and sued predatory lenders, while houses around her were being foreclosed and once lively neighborhoods turned to ghost towns.
In recent years, she oversaw the transformation of ESOP into a statewide force that was feared by bankers and public officials. This past year, ESOP successfully advocated for Richard Cordray to be appointed by President Obama as head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Last January, when the president was in Cleveland, he paid a visit to the home of William and Endia Eason, an elderly couple who had been victims of predatory lending and been assisted by ESOP. (Endia Eason baked 23 sweet potato pies for the president and his security detail.)
Killingsworth is a no-nonsense fighter who believes in holding powerful people to account. She has a quiet power about her. I met her only once, the night she was given an award. I was moved by her speech and asked if I could keep it. I have the pages in front of me now.
"Every victory we've ever had was won through community organizing," she said. "Listening to the people, bringing them together to recognize there is power in numbers."
She concluded: "Tonight I say to all of you: Let's fight back and move forward!"
In the meantime, have a peaceful holiday.

HEADLINE: On Our Radar: Ex-Japanese Ship Joins Effort to Stop Whaling

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: An ocean conservation group says its newly acquired vessel was previously owned by Japan, a leading whaling nation. 

 BODY:
In what it calls as a coup, the conservation group Sea Shepherd says it has purchased a ship previously owned by the Japanese government, one of the group's biggest antagonists, and will deploy it for antiwhaling activity. The vessel -- named the Sam Simon, after the founder of "The Simpsons," a benefactor -- will join three other ships that are to sail to the Southern Ocean this month to chase the Japanese whaling fleet.

HEADLINE: The Microeconomics of Poverty Since 2007

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Available data shows clearly that benefits that help people in poverty undercut incentives for them to seek work, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy." 
Government safety net programs were put on steroids by the 2009 stimulus law, erasing incentives for a significant fraction of the unemployed.
Last weekI noted that poverty, when measured to include taxes and government benefits, did not rise from 2007 to 2011. That result, I contended, indicated that people in the neighborhood of the poverty line faced marginal tax rates of about 100 percent. I also noted that 100 percent marginal tax rates were excessive. 
These three statements generated many angry comments, so it's worth examining them in more detail.
One possibility is that the poverty rate did rise significantly, even when adjusted to reflect taxes and government benefits. That possibility would contradict Jared Bernstein's work in this area, because he concluded that America had "the deepest recession since the Great Depression and poverty didn't go up." It would also contradict Arloc Sherman's findings that the poverty rate was essentially unchanged (thanks to generous new subsidies).

The measurement of poverty and its trends is an important and continuing research area, and future research could suggest that the poverty rate had increased. However, future research could also point in the other direction.
In 1995, a panel established by the National Research Council to evaluate poverty measurement concluded that it might make sense to recognize not only the monetary resources available to families, but also the amount of free time they had. After 2007, many people found themselves with less pretax income and more free time because they had lost their jobs. Because the official poverty measures consider only the pretax income, adjusting poverty measures to reflect free time would cause the poverty rate to fall more, or increase less, after 2007.
Assuming for the moment that Mr. Bernstein and Mr. Sherman are right about the poverty changes, a second possibility is that poverty failed to rise even while marginal tax rates were significantly less than 100 percent. As one blogger put it, "Just because poverty rates didn't rise doesn't mean that the government imposed a 100 percent implicit tax rate."
One might wonder exactly how, in theory, poverty rates remained fixed when millions of people lost their jobs, and when the government did not essentially replace all the disposable income lost because of layoffs. The magnitude of marginal tax rates imposed by the government is ultimately an empirical question, though. As far as I know, none of my detractors have offered any estimates.
I have been examining marginal tax rates under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, especially as experienced by families near the poverty line. The chart below shows some of my results pertinent to Mr. Bernstein's poverty measures.
The chart examines households that in 2007 had household income of less than 175 percent of the poverty line and were therefore at risk of falling into poverty if they were later laid off from their job. The chart organizes unemployed heads and spouses in terms of their marginal tax or "job acceptance penalty" rate. With that rate, I mean the fraction of a person's employee compensation that goes to federal, state and local government treasuries or to expenses associated with commuting to work (I assume that is $5 for each one-way trip) as a consequence of working full time at the same wage as before layoff rather than remaining unemployed. (The remainder of the worker's compensation, if any, is left to enhance the disposable income of the worker and the worker's family.) 
The chart also organizes unemployed people in terms of what they earned weekly before layoff, with special attention to the group in the $250 to $349 range, which is near the weekly earnings of a full-time minimum-wage job.
Among the unemployed who had earned near minimum wage (shown in red in the chart), a majority had a job-acceptance penalty rate of at least 100 percent, meaning that accepting a job with the same pretax pay as they had before layoff would not increase their disposable income. If they were to accept such a job, all the compensation would go to the Treasury in additional personal income taxes, additional payroll taxes and reduced unemployment insurance benefits (under the stimulus, unemployment insurance benefits alone were more than half of the pretax pay from the previous job), and in some cases reduced benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as SNAP, and Medicaid.
Only 18 percent of those earning near minimum wage had a job-acceptance penalty rate of less than 80 percent.
My results consider the unemployment insurance program and its federal additional compensation and subsidies for Cobra, which gives workers who have lost their jobs the right to purchase group health insurance for a limited period of time; SNAP; Medicaid; the regular personal income tax (both federal and state); the earned-income tax credit, the child tax credit, the additional child tax credit and the "making work pay" tax credit. 
Job-acceptance penalty rates of 100 percent or more are probably more prevalent than shown in the chart because I did not include child care costs among employment expenses and did not include programs like disability insurance, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Supplemental Security Income, means-tested housing subsidies, means-tested tuition assistance, means-tested energy-assistance programs and other programs that impose positive implicit marginal tax rates.
I agree with Mr. Bernstein that government policy, especially the 2009 stimulus law, is responsible for preventing a rise in the poverty rate. But it achieved that end by erasing incentives for a significant fraction of the unemployed.

HEADLINE: Top Deutsche Bank Executives Caught Up in Tax Evasion Inquiry

BYLINE: JACK EWING


HIGHLIGHT: In the course of a tax-evasion inquiry, investigators are trying to determine whether J&#252;rgen Fitschen, co-chief executive of Deutsche Bank, and Stefan Krause, the chief financial officer, played a role by signing certain tax forms. 

 BODY:
FRANKFURT - After a raid at company headquarters, Deutsche Bank disclosed Wednesday that two of its highest-ranking executives are a focus of a tax evasion investigation, dealing a fresh blow to the German institution's already battered reputation. 
German authorities are looking into whether bank employees conspired to avoid sales tax on the trading of carbon emission certificates. As part of that inquiry, prosecutors are trying to determine whether Jürgen Fitschen, the co-chief executive, and Stefan Krause, the chief financial officer, played a role by signing certain tax forms. 
On Wednesday, about 500 police officers searched Deutsche Bank offices in Frankfurt, Düsseldorf and Berlin, as well as private homes. Mr. Fitschen and Mr. Krause are among 25 people who have been ensnared by the tax-evasion inquiry. 
 The police arrested five people, who were not identified. Those arrested did not include Mr. Fitschen or Mr. Krause.
Deutsche Bank said it was cooperating with the authorities but added that it had already revised the value-added tax reporting in question. ''Unlike the Public Prosecutor's Office, Deutsche Bank is of the opinion that this correction took place in due time,'' the bank said in a statement. It declined to comment further.
Top executives sign many documents, and it was not clear whether prosecutors believed that Mr. Fitschen and Mr. Krause were knowingly involved in an attempt to avoid taxes. Prosecutors could not be reached for comment late Wednesday.
The investigation will only complicate the bank's turnaround efforts. 
Like rivals, the German institutions is struggling in the face of the European debt crisis, weak economic conditions and new regulation. Deutsche Bank could be hit particularly hard by new rules taking effect in the coming years that will require banks to increase the amount of capital they hold as a cushion against losses. Deutsche Bank has acknowledged that it needs to bolster its reserves.
At the same time, Mr. Fitschen and Anshu Jain, the bank's other co-chief executive, have been trying improve the bank's image. In September, Mr. Fitschen and Mr. Jain announced a broad effort to raise ethical standards. Acknowledging that the bank had made mistakes, the executives promised to reduce risk, set more modest profit goals and reduce employee bonuses.
But those efforts have been stymied by a series of setbacks.
The bank is among institutions being investigated by the authorities in the United States and Europe in connection with possible manipulation of the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, which is used to set rates for trillions of dollars in mortgages and other financial instruments worldwide.
In May, Deutsche Bank paid $202 million to settle claims by the U.S. Department of Justice that one of the bank's subsidiaries had filed false information in order to qualify for federal mortgage insurance. The bank is also the target of multiple lawsuits in the United States related to its sale of securities linked to the mortgage market.
While bank executives appeared to be surprised by the raid Wednesday, the underlying allegations had been known for several years.
Since 2005, the European Union has set allowances for energy producers, manufacturers and other companies that produce carbon dioxide and other gases that contribute to global warming. Companies that do not use all their allowances may sell them, a system designed to give the companies an incentive to reduce their emissions.
The European Commission has repeatedly made changes to the system that are intended to prevent abuses. In the past, traders have collected value-added tax from customers but failed to pass the money on to governments.
In October, the Süddeutsche Zeitung, a newspaper in Munich, reported that Deutsche Bank fired five traders in connection with irregularities in carbon trading. The bank has not denied the report..

HEADLINE: Political Predictions, Holiday Edition

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS and GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: Brooks and Collins on Christmas tree vendors, Hanukkah fundamentalists and what will happen over the next year in Congress and the White House. 

 BODY:
 Gail Collins: Happy holidays, David! I can tell we're in the Christmas season because the tree sellers have returned from Quebec and set up shop on my corner. I always enjoy getting off the subway and walking through what seems to be a small forest populated by people speaking French and brandishing hatchets.
This year I am willing to forgo our annual argument about Christmas overkill - the one where I complain about having to listen to "The Little Drummer Boy" while shopping for hardware supplies. We may have permanently agreed to disagree on that one.
 David Brooks: And happy holidays to you too! Did you know that we are already practically in the middle of Hanukkah, the holiday during which assimilated Jews gather together to celebrate the martial exploits of a group of fundamentalist Jews who would have despised them? I suppose it's no more odd than a special on the E! Network celebrating the birth of Christ. 
Down here in Washington we don't have too many sidewalk Christmas tree vendors, but we do have the White House Christmas parties. The president and his wife host thousands and thousands of people at a long string of parties every year. The guests schmooze while eating little lamb chops upstairs as the first couple is trapped, hour upon hour, in an endless photo line.
 Gail: Do you think people know about that when they agree to run for president?
 David: When you enter the party, you get a ticket that gives you a rough time when you will get to have your picture taken with the president and his wife. Then you stand in line for your 10 seconds of photo time. You and your guests stand between these two giants and you feel like hobbits. They look about 9 feet tall in the photos and are effortlessly slender. Key advice to all men in this situation under 6 feet: Next year, wear heels.
Sometimes I stand outstand the photo room to watch the people come out. They are glowing. They are euphoric. Their brief moment with Michelle and Barack leaves them ecstatic. The presidency is a very powerful thing.
 Gail: Maybe they're also ecstatic at being observed, sociologically, by David Brooks. But let me move on past Christmas and skip right on to the new year. What are your political predictions for 2013? I want to be the first to ask you.
I'll start. I predict we won't fall off the fiscal cliff. And that when we converse after the deal is done, I'll complain that the president gave away too much. This is partly because the way it looks now, I don't think he needs to give much of anything.
 David: The objective conditions certainly point to a deal. But I'm not so sure. Republicans really want to get some entitlement reform in exchange for their cave-in on rates. In private, many are still talking about holding firm. Obama may decide that this is his chance to crush the G.O.P. into a shapeless pulp and may demand their utter humiliation before agreeing to a compromise. Once the tension heats up, the ideological circus comes to town. Everybody starts playing by circus rules, and anything can happen.
 Gail: I predict the Supreme Court will toss out the Defense of Marriage Act. Although possibly by throwing the gay marriage issue back to the states. The fact that they decided to consider both the federal law and a lower court ruling about California makes me suspect they'll say it's up to the states to make the rules for marriage, but in the states where gay marriage is legal, the partners are eligible for federal spousal benefits.
Obviously, that wouldn't make any sense - it'd be like upholding the old state laws against interracial marriage. But I just find it hard to imagine this court making the kind of sweeping stand for civil liberties that a righteous ruling would require. Maybe I'm being too cynical. What do you think?
 David: I agree with you. On these big social issues, my guess is that the courts will gradually allow gay marriage and gradually forbid affirmative action, at least based strictly on race. Of course I want both those things to happen, so perhaps I'm allowing the wish to be father to the thought.
 Gail: Now that Jim DeMint is leaving the Senate to serve the nation by running a think tank for what sounds like it's going to be a seven-figure salary, I predict Ted Cruz will be the Tea Party Senate standout. Cruz is, as you well know, the incoming Senator from Texas. The one who claimed the United Nations was plotting to undermine the nation's golf courses.
 David: I disagree with you there. I don't know Cruz, but he comes with a very mixed reputation among Republicans in Texas. He may not be the sort who can rally people, especially since he is a freshman. I'd go with Rand Paul. Or, more likely, I think there will be no Tea Party standout. The category will cease to exist as Tea Party types blend back into the normal conservative categories.
By the way, in retrospect, isn't it hilarious the way the media overhyped the Occupy Wall Street movement? The Tea Party at least had some political impact. The Occupy movement was nothing but a media creation. It was a bunch of hip editors and reporters from Brooklyn exaggerating the importance of a bunch of disgruntled liberal arts majors. O.K., I'm overgeneralizing, but not by much.
 Gail: Well, at least Occupy Wall Street didn't force Todd Akin into the Missouri Senate nomination.
Here's my next prediction. The Democrats will spend the next year wondering what Hillary will do. They won't find out until 2014.
 David: She'll run.
 Gail: The big post-cliff issue in Congress will, of course, be immigration reform. Some of the Republicans, as you know, are trying to figure out a way to do it in "pieces" with the easy stuff like a Dream Act and opening the door for high-skilled workers coming first. The Democrats won't let them. Because they know that if the easy stuff comes first, the hard stuff like a path to citizenship for people who are already here illegally will never come up at all.
 David: My big prediction for 2013 is that immigration won't be the big post-cliff issue. It will still be budgets. Cutting a short-term deal in December makes only a small dent in the looming fiscal catastrophe. To actually address the problem, you have to do tax reform and Medicare reform. You have to think outside the 10-year budget window and start to make the changes that will lead to debt levels in 2030 that are in fact level. If you don't make these changes now, they become impossible later on.
 Gail: Now that sounds more like a David wish. If Congress was made up of good planners with the long-term national well-being at the tippy-top of their priority list, you would probably be right.
 David: As for immigration, I guess I'm of the belief that bigger is easier because there are many moving pieces you can trade with. I just hope the Democrats finally let us increase the number of skilled immigrants, especially the ones we are educating.
 Gail: By the way, do you know what a major push for immigration reform next year means? That Congress is going to do nothing about global warming. Zero. Zip. If we could just get all the people who live near a coast to vote en masse, maybe there'd be hope for 2014.
 David: Fracking. Fracking. Fracking. The switch from coal to natural gas will be an improvement, though not a solution. Gradually, after a few more years, solar and wind will be able to compete with fossil fuels economically, but it will take awhile. By the way, there was a great New Yorker piece on other ways to address global warming at the back end.
My favorite involves stirring the oceans with giant straws. You bring the cold bottom water to the surface and that cools the atmosphere. I'm hoping that they'll also find all the pairs of glasses I've lost body surfing.

HEADLINE: Eric Schmidt: How We Outrace the Robots

BYLINE: QUENTIN HARDY


HIGHLIGHT: The executive chairman of Google says that the three great economic trends of our time are globalization, demography and automation, and together they will create a worldwide crisis in employment. The solution for the United States, he says, is to see this as a "Sputnik moment" and create a revolution in creating lifelong analytic learners. 

 BODY:
At the Deal Book conference today in Manhattan, I asked the executive chairman of Google, Eric Schmidt, where in the world the jobs for a great many people will be. His advice: We have to learn how to "outrace the robots."
"Given the trends of globalization, automation and demographics, there will definitely be a small number of people who will be very prosperous," said Mr. Schmidt. The challenge is to let as many people into that class as possible, and even more important, get masses of people educated to a level where they can qualify for work in the new businesses these people create. 
Mr. Schmidt was speaking in an interview after appearing onstage at the New York TimesDealBook conference. Earlier he, along with Mike Moritz, a partner in the Sequoia Capital venture capital firm, and Clara Shih, the founder of Hearsay Social, discussed how cloud computing's access to a nearly limitless amount of knowledge and a borderless consumer base would create great fortunes.
Throw in robotics, 3-D printing, and faster telecommunications, and things get tougher for the average worker. Robots may hollow out the factories in China, which count on cheap human labor, and bring manufacturing back to the United States. Those machines will need people to service them, and those people will need to be reasonably skilled.
Jobs like that are likely to be well worth having. But who says those robot operators have to be United States-based, just because the machines are? In a world like that, I asked Mr. Schmidt, what are the chances that the United States can expect to have unemployment of 6 percent or even lower?
"I don't think anyone can say the answer, but we can state the risks," Mr. Schmidt said. "The way to combat it is education, which has to work for everyone, regardless of race or gender. You'll have global competition for all kinds of jobs."
Understanding this, he said, should be America's "Sputnik moment," which like that 1957 Russian satellite launch gives the nation a new urgency about education in math and science. "The president could say that in five years he wants the level of analytic education in this country - STEM education in science, technology, engineering and math, or economics and statistics - has to be at a level of the best Asian countries."
Asian nations, Mr. Schmidt said, are probably going to proceed with their own increases in analytic education. "Employment is going to be a global problem, not a U.S. one," he said.
Can we really outrun the robots, though? Mr. Schmidt cited the so-called "Flynn effect," which notes that human intelligence appears to have risen on a sustained basis for several decades, possibly because people now live in more stimulating environments.
"The issue is, can you get the Flynn effect, plus education, to outrun the robots?" said Mr. Schmidt, who because of Google is a billionaire, and confessed his own self-interest in the matter.
"I am acutely aware that my economic and personal success depends on having a great number of customers and educated employees," he said. It also matters that he has a stable world, without too many economic and political dislocations caused by our technology revolution.

HEADLINE: One is the Loneliest Number

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Judith Shulevitz on the consequences of delayed childbearing. 

 BODY:
In the latest issue of the New Republic, Judith Shulevitz offers a fascinating and fairly personal meditation on the consequences of delayed childbearing and older parenting for American society. At heart, the essay is about public health, and the ways in which older parenting - especially older male parenting, the latest research on sperm quality suggests - and fertility treatments seem to be associated with increasing risks of birth defects, genetic disorders, schizophrenia, and possibly autism as well. But there's a long section on the social consequences of postponing parenting, which intertwines in interesting ways with some of the birthrate-related issues I've been writing about lately. Here's an extended quote from Shulevitz on the world that delayed childbearing is making:
... As soon as we procrastinators manage to have kids, we also become members of the "sandwich generation." That is, we're caught between our toddlers tugging on one hand and our parents talking on the phone in the other, giving us the latest updates on their ailments. Grandparents well into their senescence provide less of the support younger grandparents offer-the babysitting, the spoiling, the special bonds between children and their elders through which family traditions are passed. 
Another downside of bearing children late is that parents may not have all the children they dreamed of having, which can cause considerable pain. Long-term studies have shown that, when people put off having children till their mid-thirties and later, they fail to reach "intended family size"-that is, they produce fewer children than they'd said they'd meant to when interviewed a decade or so earlier.
... What haunts me about my children, though, is ... the actuarial risk I run of dying before they're ready to face the world.
At an American Society for Reproductive Medicine meeting last year, two psychologists and a gynecologist antagonized a room full of fertility experts by making the unpopular but fairly obvious point that older parents die earlier in their children's lives. ("We got a lot of blowback in terms of reproductive rights and all that," the gynecologist told me.) A mother who is 35 when her child is born is more likely than not to have died by the time that child is 46. The one who is 45 may have bowed out of her child's life when he's 37. The odds are slightly worse for fathers: The 35-year-old new father can hope to live to see his child turn 42. The 45-year-old one has until the child is 33.
These numbers may sound humdrum, but even under the best scenarios, the death of a parent who had children late, not to mention the long period of decline that precedes it, will befall those daughters and sons when they still need their parents' help-because, let's face it, even grown-up children rely on their parents more than they used to. They need them for guidance at the start of their careers, and they could probably also use some extra cash for the rent or the cable bill, if their parents can swing it ... They may not go off the parental payroll until their mid- to late-twenties. Children also need their parents not to need them just when they've had children of their own.
There's an entire body of sociological literature on how parents' deaths affect children, and it suggests that losing a parent distresses young adults more than older adults, low-income young adults more than high-income ones, and daughters more than sons. Curiously, the early death of a mother correlates to a decline in physical health in both sexes, and the early death of a father correlates to increased drinking among young men ...
It's obvious, in a way, and yet the obvious bears emphasis: In a world where children are born later and less frequently, and where the two trends intertwine, the life cycle inevitably gets lonelier. Your grandparents are less likely to be involved with your upbringing when you're young, you're less likely to have multiple siblings (or even a single brother or sister) to be your companions in childhood and your constants in adulthood, your own children are less likely to have aunts and uncles and cousins and your parents are more likely to pass away (or decline into senescence) before you're fully established as a grown-up in your own right.
There are economic costs to this atomization, just as Shulevitz suggests: Weaker support networks when people are young and struggling, fewer kids to share the burden of an aging relative, and so on. But the emotional costs seem larger - not just the impact of a parent's early passing, but the non-impact of the relationships you never get to form, because your grandparents are too old and your siblings and cousins and aunts and uncles don't exist at all.
Now not everyone will suffer, or suffer equally, from this thinning out of kin networks. Families smother and warp as well as sustain and support, and the world of what Joel Kotkin calls "post-familialism" is a world of liberation as well as loneliness, in which Freudian tangles and Cain-and-Abel rivalries are less intense and potentially destructive, and the easier lift of "Friendsgiving" replaces the emotional burdens of family reunions. Certainly there are points in the life cycle - those carefree twenties, in particular - when "going solo" seems like a gift rather than a burden, and if you choose the right friends and eventually the right partner and live in the right places and make the right financial decisions those points can be extended deeper into the life cycle, and maybe all the way into retirement and beyond.
But the costs are real and obvious as well. If families do not guarantee happiness, the relationships they create and cultivate nonetheless tend to be richer, more primal, and more permanent than purely voluntary forms of human community. (It's noteworthy that the most extensive attempt, historically, to recreate this richness voluntarily - the vowed religious communities of brother monks and priests and sister nuns - is likewise waning in our culture.) Families are the most natural link between the generations, the most natural place to turn for solidarity, intimacy and care, the communities where the mystic chords of memory are easiest to strike and most likely to vibrate, resonate, and echo. Even the unhappiness of families vindicates this point: Not always but as a general rule, the wounds of divorce, separation, estrangement and abandonment tend to cut deeper than the damage from a broken friendship precisely because the original bond is that much stronger and significant.
As Matthew Schmitz puts it, "it is not that with bigger families life is necessarily happier, but instead that it is richer, denser. What happiness we have will be more widely and immediately shared, as with our sorrow." And likewise with what is lost when families shrink and intergenerational bonds attenuate. The cost should be counted, not in daily pleasures sacrificed or swiped away, but in the deep wells of human experience that a post-familial culture may fill in and cover up.
This is why the moral aspect of the case for, well, familialism - the hackles-raising argument I've been making that a society that isn't replacing itself isn't fulfilling a basic intergenerational obligation- cannot just be set aside in favor of less charged and more technocratic arguments about economic self-interest and social cohesion and public health and the sustainability of public pensions and so forth. These arguments matter, obviously, and may matter immensely as we enter our ever-grayer future. But even allowing for all of the practical problems associated with demographic decline, it is still possible to imagine a world of declining birthrates and more attenuated relationships being more comfortable, in strictly material terms, than the present or the past. Matt Yglesias has been making roughly this case, for instance, painting a portrait of a future where the surplus from technology and automation under-writes leisure pursuits (mostly virtual, I would expect) and social-service support for the many singletons left underemployed and unemployable, and everyone else finds work in the booming, ever-expanding elder-caregiver industry.
Measured in terms of G.D.P. per capita and life expectancy, that future doesn't sound so bad. It's only when you factor in the loss of various rich and fundamental human goods that you realize that it might actually be barren and depressing and yes, decadent - a lanscape, in Goethe's evocative phrase, in which humanity has "won" in some sense, triumphing provisionally over the challenges of scarcity and illness, but in the process has turned society "into one huge hospital where everyone is everybody else's humane nurse." On Twitter, I called it a world of "video games in the morning, changing strangers' bedpans in the afternoon, soma at nightfall," and while the Brave New World reference is no doubt overly dystopian, the basic point stands. The comfortable society is not necessarily the good society, and while a future that promises mass idleness and mass isolation might be more stable than demographic pessimists suspect, that doesn't make it a future where I'd particularly want to live, let alone one I'd feel happy bequeathing to my daughters and generations after them.

HEADLINE: Rick Snyder on 'Right to Work'

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: He suggested the law will make unions stronger. 

 BODY:
Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder explained on Morning Joe today that his state's new "right to work" law is actually good for workers and unions; it makes unions stronger by requiring them to "present a good value proposition" to workers that will inspire them to join up. 
I'm so glad he explained that, because here I thought that the law was actually an attempt to undermine unions by starving them of dues that pay for bargaining and political action, like donating to candidates, which the Supreme Court said is the right of every corporation and labor union.
"This has nothing to do with the relationship between an employer and a union," Mr. Snyder said. "This is about the relationship between unions and workers."

One of the show's panelists, Carl Bernstein, was sighing and chuckling as Mr. Snyder spoke. Even the host, Joe Scarborough, who supports "right to work" laws, was incredulous. "I would not go so far as to say what you just said, which is that it helps unions."
Because of course, it doesn't. Mr. Snyder's interviewers asked him the obvious question, which was why workers who don't want to pay dues should receive raises and other benefits negotiated by the union. He had no answer. He just stared blandly into the camera and talked about freedom.
The ability to gain without paying in gets at why Mr. Snyder's "good value proposition" argument is bogus. As Tommy Christopher put it in an article for Mediaite: "If Joe is not required to pay dues to the union that his workplace voted to have," yet continues to reap the benefits, then "there won't be a union, not for long." Eventually, "the workers will have no incentive" to contribute. "Three years from now, Joe will be taking a pay cut so the company can maintain their profits, or get fired if he doesn't like it."
Unions have suffered greatly in recent decades, in part because of their own actions or inactions, in part because of economic conditions and in part because of concerted political attacks from Republicans like Mr. Snyder - who nevertheless paid lip service to how much unions had contributed to American life in the last century. (Note had and last century.)

HEADLINE: The New York Times Names a New Business Editor

BYLINE: CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY


HIGHLIGHT: Dean Murphy, a deputy in the department, will become the new editor, replacing Larry Ingrassia, who will take on a larger role at the paper, according to a memo from the newspaper's executive editor, Jill Abramson. 

 BODY:
Dean E. Murphy, a reporter and editor with The New York Times for the last 12 years, has been named the next editor of the business section of The Times. The announcement was made on Wednesday afternoon in a memo from Jill Abramson, the executive editor. 
Mr. Murphy, 54, succeeds Larry Ingrassia, who has been the business editor since 2004. While it is unclear what Mr. Ingrassia's new position will be, Ms. Abramson said it would be "a larger role" that would be announced early next year.
Mr. Murphy previously worked at The Los Angeles Times, where he was a foreign correspondent based in Poland and South Africa and reported on the war in the former Yugoslavia. He is a graduate of Northwestern University and has a master's degree in international affairs from Johns Hopkins University. 
Since he joined The Times in 2000, Mr. Murphy has reported on politics, worked as a San Francisco correspondent and served as deputy national editor before joining the business section as a deputy editor in 2010. Ms. Abramson credited Mr. Murphy for his handling of several highly regarded articles, including an exposé on the hidden wealth of the family of Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China as well as a series on the digital economy that looked at working conditions in both the United States and in China. 
Ms. Abramson described Mr. Murphy as "one of our most accomplished editors, a staunch advocate for reporters and a fine writer himself." She added that "his years of reporting from abroad and from both coasts as well as his role as deputy national editor brought heart and breadth to our already superb business report."

HEADLINE: No Celebrity-Filled Concert on the Mall for Obama's 2nd Inaugural

BYLINE: SHERYL GAY STOLBERG


HIGHLIGHT: The only official concert will be a children's concert, similar to one that was held in 2009, according to the planners. 

 BODY:
There will be no big star-studded concert on the National Mall to celebrate President Obama's second inauguration next month, several of his inaugural planners said Wednesday. 
In 2009, a string of A-list celebrities - including Bono, Bruce Springsteen, Beyoncé, Tom Hanks, Queen Latifah, Sheryl Crow and will.i.am - performed at the Lincoln Memorial in what was billed as the"We Are One'' celebration, which featured songs and historical readings. By some estimates more than 400,000 people attended.
But Mr. Obama, mindful of the difficult economy, has set a more low-key tone for his 2013 inaugural festivities. The only official concert will be a children's concert, similar to one that was held in 2009, according to the planners, who did not want to be identified because they have not yet made the schedule public.
Details for the 2013 children's concert have not been announced, but a private online solicitation to donors promised that individuals who contribute at least $75,000 and institutions or corporations that contribute at least $250,000 would get two tickets.
In 2009, some District of Columbia schoolchildren and sons and daughters of members of the military were also invited.

HEADLINE: Senator Demands F.A.A. Relax Electronics Rules

BYLINE: NICK BILTON


HIGHLIGHT: Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri sent a letter to the Federal Aviation Administration asking the agency to allow the use of electronics during the full duration of a flight. The senator threatened to push for legislation if the agency took too long. 

 BODY:
The Federal Aviation Administration could be on the receiving end of legislation if it does not change its stance on electronics during takeoff and landing.
Senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri sent a letter to Michael Huerta, the acting administrator of the F.A.A., writing that people were "growing increasingly skeptical of prohibitions on the use of many electronic devices during the full duration of a flight." 
"I am prepared to pursue legislative solutions should progress be made too slowly," Ms. McCaskill said in the letter.
The F.A.A. did not respond to a request for comment.
Senator McCaskill, a Democrat, said she was urging the agency to embrace the use of electronics, including laptop computers, e-readers, smartphones and other devices, "during the full duration of a flight."
"The current rules are inconvenient to travelers, don't make sense and lack a scientific basis," she said in the letter. "Airline employees have the incredibly important job of keeping us safe in the air. Their efforts are better spent worrying about rules that actually accomplish that goal."
Last week, Julius Genachowski, chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, also sent a letter to the F.A.A. in which he urged the agency to allow more electronics on airplanes. He said electronic devices "empower people to stay informed and connected with friends and family, and they enable both large and small businesses to be more productive and efficient, helping drive economic growth and boost U.S. competitiveness."
This year, the F.A.A. approved iPads instead of paper flight manuals in the cockpit for pilots, but it refuses to allow passengers to use electronic devices during takeoff and landing. The agency has initiated a review of its policies about electronic devices in all phases of flight, including takeoff and landing.

HEADLINE: In a Victory for Regulators, Judge Dismisses a Mutual Fund Lawsuit

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: A federal judge dismissed a lawsuit brought by the United States Chamber of Commerce and the Investment Company Institute against the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. 

 BODY:
Wall Street suffered a rare courtroom loss on Wednesday after a federal judge sided with regulators who wanted to keep a closer eye on freewheeling derivatives trading. 
In a 93-page ruling, the judge dismissed a lawsuit that financial industry groups filed against the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, a Wall Street regulator. The groups, the United States Chamber of Commerce and the Investment Company Institute, challenged a rule that forced mutual funds and other investment companies to register with the commission.
The industry groups contended that the rule was "arbitrary and capricious." The trading commission, the lawsuit said, also failed to fully address the rule's economic effects on the mutual fund industry. 
But Judge Beryl Howell of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia rejected those claims.
"The C.F.T.C. not only provided justifications for the rule-making, but also explained the significance of the potential benefits of the rule-making," she wrote.
The surprising victory for the agency and the Obama administration could have broader implications for the fight over a host of new financial rules being considered. Wall Street and corporate groups have won many other lawsuits challenging various financial rules, including several related to the Dodd-Frank Act.
"This is a total victory not just for the C.F.T.C., but also for financial reform," said Dennis Kelleher, the head of Better Markets, an advocacy group that supports Dodd-Frank, which was created in response to the 2008 financial crisis. 
The ruling, Mr. Kelleher argued, could cast a chill on other attempts to sue federal regulators. "Hopefully, the industry will see this as a sign to call off their war on regulation and the regulators."
The mutual fund rule was not required under Dodd-Frank, but regulators say their effort was in the spirit of the law.
The legal battles have hinged not on the merits or constitutionality of Dodd-Frank but on whether regulators fully studied its effects. Wall Street has built its case around a legal provision that required regulators to evaluate the costs and the benefits any rule would impose on the economy.
The approach has worked. A federal appeals court last summer struck down the Securities and Exchange Commission's proxy access rule, a Dodd-Frank policy that would have empowered shareholders to oust company directors. 
Appeals courts have thrown out S.E.C. rules six times in seven years. In September, a federal judge vacated the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's so-called position limits rule, which would curb speculative commodities trading. 
In contrast, Judge Howell praised the trading commission's work on the mutual fund rule. The policy, adopted in February, swept up mutual funds and investment firms into the agency's new oversight of derivatives trading. 
The firms are accustomed to only facing oversight from the S.E.C. The additional scrutiny from the C.F.T.C., the industry groups argued, was duplicative. 
Judge Howell disagreed. In a sharply worded ruling that criticized the Chamber of Commerce and the Investment Company Institute for their "myopic view" of the rule, she took aim at the groups for their argument that the rule was unnecessary. 
Saying the groups got "carried away by their own rhetoric," she noted that the 2008 crisis was "due in significant part to derivatives trading, lack of transparency, and the lack of regulatory oversight, all of which prompted enactment of Dodd-Frank."
It is unclear whether the groups will appeal. The investment institute issued a statement late Wednesday saying it was "disappointed with the court's ruling" and was "reviewing the decision now and evaluating our options."
The trading commission's chairman, however, praised the ruling. "I commend the rule-writing, economic and legal teams at the C.F.T.C. for their excellent work and dedication," said the commission chairman, Gary Gensler.

HEADLINE: Latino Groups Warn Congress to Fix Immigration, or Else

BYLINE: JULIA PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: The nation's largest Latino organizations said they will keep a report card during the immigration debate next year, with plans to mobilize their voters against lawmakers who do not support a comprehensive immigration bill. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - The nation's largest Latino organizations warned Congress on Wednesday that they will keep a report card during the immigration debate next year, with plans to mobilize their voters against lawmakers who do not support a comprehensive immigration bill. 
At a news conference here, seven Latino groups and one labor union were showing their muscle, after the record turnout of Hispanic voters in the November elections played a pivotal role in President Obama's re-election victory. 
Janet Murguía, the president of N.C.L.R., also called the National Council of La Raza, said the election had been a "game-changer" that conclusively "made the political case for a bipartisan solution" on immigration. 
"We have worked to build our power and now we intend to use it," Ms. Murguía said. "The bottom line," she said, "is that Latino voters went to the polls with the economy on their minds but with immigration reform in their hearts." 
The leaders made it clear they expect quick action in 2013. They said the president and Congress should take up an immigration bill soon after Mr. Obama's inauguration in January, with an eye toward completing passage of legislation by August. 
The leaders said they would continue a joint campaign they led this year to naturalize Latino immigrants and to register and mobilize Latino voters. They said they would send results from the report card to those voters, to galvanize them during the debate and to guide their choices in the midterm elections in 2014. 
"Make no mistake, we will be watching," said Eliseo Medina, international secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union, which led one of the most extensive Latino voter drives. The report card will show "who stood with us and who stood against us" on immigration reform, Mr. Medina said. 
Mr. Obama has said he intends to move quickly on immigration next year, after Congress comes to some resolution on the year-end fiscal crisis and other budget issues. A host of Republicans have come forward since the election to say their party should take a new course on immigration, after Mitt Romney drew only 27 percent of the Latino vote.
Republican leaders who have studied voting statistics are concerned that their party's chances to regain the White House will dwindle if they cannot attract more Latinos. According to the Pew Hispanic Center, Latinos will account for as much as 40 percent of the growth in the numbers of eligible voters in the country between now and 2030. By that year, the center predicts, 40 million Hispanics will be eligible to vote, nearly double the 23 million eligible today. 
The leaders said Latinos were spurred to the polls by the hard-line positions that Mr. Romney and other Republicans took on immigration.
"We realized that people were attacking us personally," said Maria Teresa Kumar, president of Voto Latino, a voter mobilization group. The Latino groups will focus on lawmakers in states and districts where their voters can make a difference. For those who do not support reform, Ms. Kumar said, "in 2014 it may not look pretty for them."
Latino leaders argued that Washington has done enough to bolster enforcement against illegal immigration. 
"We can no longer see enforcement-only policies moving through Congress," said Chris Espinosa, national advocacy director for the Hispanic Federation. "We have secured our borders, now it's time to get to other elements of immigration reform." 
The leaders said they seek a single comprehensive bill, rather than several bills addressing legalization for groups of illegal immigrants, like young people or farmworkers. They said they would insist on a path to citizenship for all 11 million illegal immigrants in the country, rather than a temporary legal status that does not offer an eventual chance to naturalize. 
The news conference also included leaders from the League of United Latin American Citizens and the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund. 
Mr. Medina, expressing some of the optimistic bravado Latinos are feeling, promised a "massive" grass roots campaign next year. "It's going to be a doozy," he said. 
"Failure is not an option," Mr. Medina said. "Comprehensive immigration reform is going to happen. Whether it will be over the political bodies of some of the current members of Congress," he said, "only they can decide."

HEADLINE: Live Blog: DealBook's Post-Election Conference

BYLINE: ERIC OWLES, MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED and WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The fiscal cliff in the United States, the European debt crisis and the slowdown in China's economy have all weighed down deal-making. Our inaugural conference, "DealBook: Opportunities for Tomorrow," explored these challenges and possibilities.

 5:32 p.m. | Updated 
The fiscal cliff in the United States, the European debt crisis and the slowdown in China's economy have all weighed on deal-making. The 2012 election results were supposed to provide some clarity to our fiscal future, but the outcome of the much-debated tax increases and budget cuts remains uncertain. Our inaugural conference, "DealBook: Opportunities for Tomorrow," explored the challenges and the possibilities in this environment.
Writers and editors at The New York Times interviewed leaders and chief executives from Wall Street to Silicon Valley in a day-long conference at the Times Center in New York. Whether you attending in person or watched our video feed above, you can continue the conversation on Twitter with the hash tag #DBconf.
The official conference web site included biographies of the speakers and an agenda for the day's events. 
 5:30 P.M. | The Justin Bieber of Economics 
An audience member says that seeing Mr. Krugman is like being a 13-year-old at a Justin Bieber concert.
But the economist, who is a fan of the band Arcade Fire, admits he has never actually listened to Mr. Bieber's music.
"It's taken some work, but I've never heard him."
He says, however, that he has measured himself against the young pop star in other ways. Mr. Krugman says he has about 1/40th of Mr. Bieber's followers on Twitter.
@kevinroose But @nytimeskrugman has heard Arcade Fire. So a net gain. #DBConf

But he *has* heard of stochastic calculus! RT @kevinroose: The big takeaway from #dbconf: Paul Krugman has never heard Justin Bieber.
- Nick Confessore (@nickconfessore) December 12, 2012
That's all for the inaugural DealBook conference. A reception at the Times Center follows the conference, but the conversation continues online at #DBConf.
- William Alden 
 5:25 P.M. | On the Treasury and the Fed 
Mr. Krugman is asked what he would do if asked to be Treasury secretary or Federal Reserve chairman.
In either case, he says, he would ask, "Are you sure about this?"
On a more serious note, he outlines some criticism of the current Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner.
"I certainly hope that whoever is the next Treasury secretary is going to be more confrontational when necessary than Geithner's been," Mr. Krugman says. "He's been way too willing to let the banks put on debt relief for homeowners, was apparently instrumental in Obama's very soft line that last time we hit the debt ceiling."
He also spoke about Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman.
"What I really want is Ben Bernanke of 2000 who was much more aggressive in the use of monetary policy than Ben Bernakke of recent years has been. Although, he seems to be gaining."
"I think we're starting to see the Ben Bernanke who hired me at Princeton starting to make an appearance."
- William Alden 
 5:12 P.M. | Approaching the Cliff 
On trading floors and in board rooms, everyone is talking about the so-called fiscal cliff. Mr. Krugman speculates the odds of going over the cliff are even. That would trigger spending cuts and tax increases early next year.
But Mr. Krugman is an economist, not a Washington insider. He says the economy could be harmed even if a deal is reached in time. "The most damaging parts of the fiscal cliff are not even on the table," he says.
In any case, the forecast is gloomy.
"I'm worried," Mr. Krugman says. "I'm even more worried about the stuff that's just a couple of months further down the road, which is the debt ceiling. Those are scary things."
He notes that this economic threat is a political creation - a situation that's become all too common these days.
"Obama has to put a stop to this," Mr. Krugman says. "He has to draw a line. When better to do that than right at the beginning of his second term?"
- William Alden 
 4:52 P.M. | The Rise of China 
How will growth in China affect the United States? Mr. Krugman is wary.
"I would say that to some extent we are hurt by Chinese growth, not because of the competition of Chinese products in our market," he says. "But because there are scarce natural resources."
He continues: "If you worry about climate change, China's growth is a wonderful human success story that could kill us all."
But he offers a caveat.
"All economic statistics are just a boring form of science fiction, but China is more fictional than most."
- William Alden 
 4:40 P.M. | Krugman's View From Washington 
Paul Krugman, an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times, is talking with David Leonhardt, Washington bureau chief for The Times.
- Eric Owles 
 4:30 P.M. | No Easy Fix Is Seen for Europe 
Fixing Europe will not be easy or fast, according to the panel's members. Mr. Clementi says that he isn't expecting the demise of a European nation or a "catastrophe" anytime soon, but he thinks that an Italy or a France or a Spain will suffer from what he calls a depression.
Mr. Lasry argues that Europe still has an enormous number of problems, which haven't been fully accounted for. He notes that the cost of buying a European company remains on average more than nine times earnings.
And yet, he says that there's still a reason to put money into European economies. "As long as I know that France is going to be around next year," he says, "I'm happy to invest in France."
Ultimately, while Europe may not collapse, Mr. Lasry, the continent may be home to a "lost generation" that hasn't enjoyed the growth of its predecessors.
Mr. Veron says that there isn't any just one problem that needs fixing. But perhaps the most intractable may be a very fundamental one: a breaking of trust. Investors aren't likely to see Italian debt or Spanish debt as risk-free anymore.
That will require creating a new kind of asset that can draw the faith of investors, he says, describing what essentially sounds like a European-wide bond. "We need something that is issued at the European level to have this level of trust among investors," he says.
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 4:23 P.M. | Eric Schmidt: How We Outrace the Robots 
Off the stage, Mr. Hardy asked the executive chairman of Google where in the world the jobs for a great many people will be. His advice: We have to learn how to "outrace the robots." Read more »
 4:05 P.M. | What's Next in the Euro Crisis? 
Gian Luca Clementi, an associate professor of economics at New York University's Stern School of Business; Marc Lasry, chief executive of Avenue Capital; and Nicolas Veron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research firm in Brussels; are talking about the European debt crisis. The conversation is being moderated by Larry Ingrassia, the business editor for The New York Times.
Mr. Lasry's hedge fund is betting on a long-term come back for Europe.
 On the Agenda: A steady stream of plans and summits has so far managed to stave off disaster in the eurozone, but deep structural problems persist. Is one of the world's major economic regions fated to stumble on through crisis, or is there a prospect of resolution?
- Eric Owles 
 3:46 P.M. | Market Mover 
Mr. Duhigg is discussing his book, "The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business."
Here is an excerpt from The Times Sunday book review:
He makes his case by presenting fascinating stories and case histories. Readers will learn how and why Target can tell which of its female customers are pregnant, even before they have told their friends and family; how Rick Warren went from a depressed minister of a small congregation to the leader of one of the biggest megachurches in the world; why Rosa Parks's refusal to give up her seat started a movement when similar refusals by others had not; and why a 1987 fire in a London Underground station failed to be contained, leading to the deaths of 31 people. 
- Eric Owles 
 3:19 P.M. | Coffee! 
We're breaking for coffee, but we'll back at 3:45 with Charles Duhigg, a reporter for The New York Times, and the author of "The Power of Habit". Submit you questions and comments for the panel at #DBConf.
- Eric Owles 
 3:19 P.M. | On Corporate Social Responsibility 
Ms. Nooyi says she doesn't see corporate social responsibility as something separate from the business model. Rather, she says, it should be woven in.
For instance, she says, using less plastic and less water is good for the environment and it helps PepsiCo reduce its costs. On diversity, she says she has fostered an environment that is more welcoming for women - something that, she says, strengthens the company.
Ms. Nooyi says all of this is intended to "sustain a level of performance into the future, rather than just the duration of the C.E.O."
- Wiliam Alden 
 3:09 P.M. | PepsiCo's Chief on the Soda Ban 
Add Ms. Nooyi to the list of people unhappy with Michael R. Bloomberg's ban on the sale of large sugary drinks.
She said she wished the mayor had solicited more input from the private sector, and said there were more subtle ways he could have gone about encouraging New Yorkers to be healthier.
"There are so many behavioral methods we could have tried, rather than an uneven, heavy-handed way of saying 16 ounces is bad," she said.
- William Alden 
 3:00 P.M. | The Insider Trading Question 
Mr. Stewart delves into a topic that he's very familiar with: insider trading. With the investigations that the federal government is prosecuting in recent years, how concerned are the panelists with that crime?
Mr. Dalio, who doesn't seem to regard it as a problem within his firm, says that the biggest danger is to treat hedge funds as a group or alternatives as a group. Let's not tar everyone with the same brush, he warns.
Mr. Rubenstein takes a similar tack. "No investor really says to me, 'I'm really worried about insider trading within your organization,'" he says. At the same time, Carlyle spends a lot of time and money on compliance because it's trying to scare employees and letting them know that the crime won't be tolerated.
But Mr. Schwarzman has a different, and much more personal, point of view. He notes his own close brush with insider trading this way: "I was privileged to have an office next to a guy named Dennis Levine." Amid chuckles from the audience, Mr. Schwarzman continues that Mr. Levine, his former colleague at Lehman Brothers, was stealing his deals.
"I must tell you, it's the most traumatizing thing that's happened in my business career," the Blackstone chief says."When we started Blackstone, I vowed that would never happen. And it has not."
He recalls his speech to the first batch of business school recruits that his firm hired, replete with the line, "If you ever violate that, I will hunt you down and send you to jail."
It's a speech that didn't go well with Mr. Schwarzman's other partners as the right kind of introduction, he says. "But I didn't care."
He still gives the speech he says. But it may have lost some of its impact: "Of course, someone else warns them."
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 2:51 P.M. | The C.E.O Interview 
Indra Nooyi, the chief of PepsiCo, is talking with Joe Nocera, an Op-Ed columnist for The New York Times.
Earlier this year, Ms. Nooyi was discussed as a candidate to become the next head of the World Bank, but recent shake-ups at PepsiCo have led people to believe that she will remain with the company for the foreseeable future.
 On the Agenda: The last few years have seen unprecedented turbulence in the global economy. How does a global corporation navigate through such times?
- Eric Owles 
 2:36 P.M. | Where Do These Investors Want to Be? 
Mr. Dalio says that within his firm, there's a constant discussion about tactics, and where to be, and where not to be. "It's hard to have a portfolio without bias, and have a very well-balanced portfolio," he says, with too many people having a bias toward being long.
That said, here's what he thinks:

        
There's a place for gold.
        
Equities will probably do better than bonds longer term
        
Emerging markets will do well, with the squeeze on their currencies largely over.
Mr. Schwarzman said that Blackstone's moving out of junk bonds and into high-yielding bank debt because the latter carries a floating interest rate instead of a fixed on.
Mr. Rubenstein had a much more prosaic answer: He doesn't want to be buying apartments in new York City above the 60th floor. "It's a bubble," he says. His investment companions on stage quickly chime in that neither of them is a member of that group either.
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 2:30 P.M. | Where to Invest? Where to Avoid? 
Mr. Stewart asks the panelists where are the great places to invest, given that times of turmoil can yield attractive opportunities if one has conviction.
For Mr. Dalio, the world is in a great period of deleveraging. But he thinks that risk premiums could stand to be squeezed a bit more. At the same time, any expansion of risk premiums will generally be a negative development for asset classes as a whole.
At some point, however, Mr. Dalio said that betting against corporate bonds will prove to be highly attractive. That time hasn't come yet, he said.
Mr. Rubenstein, who is an optimist that the fiscal cliff will be resolved - though not necessarily in a pretty way - thinks that the United States is still the most attractive place to strike private equity deals. For instance, the health care industry could prove attractive, as the Obama administration's regulatory changes take effect and the American populace continues aging.
But the Carlyle chief added that some geographically unusual parts of the world could also yield interesting opportunities. One such place is sub-Saharan Africa, which he predicts could eventually have more available workers than in China.
Mr. Schwarzman said that any resolution of the fiscal cliff is likely to create some drag on the economy. "We're not optimists on the runaway upside scale," he said. 
That said, the Blackstone cofounder lauded the promise of real estate, an asset class that comprises an enormous part of his firm's business. The firm has been busy buying up assets like warehouses in Europe, earning a healthy return "without doing anything."
Where are places to avoid, Mr. Stewart asks?
Mr. Rubenstein identifies one place as Russia. "Russia might be attractive to visit as a tourist, and it may have great natural resources," he said. But it's hard to make money there in private equity.
Mr. Schwarzman said anther place was India, citing a difficult business governance structure that has long bedeviled outside investors. "Even some Indians are giving up on India," he said.
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 2:01 P.M. | Follow the Money in Private Equity and Hedge Funds 
Ray Dalio, the founder of Bridgewater Associates; David Rubenstein, a co-founder of The Carlyle Group; and Stephen A. Schwarzman, chief of The Blackstone Group; discuss what they are focusing on next in a conversation moderated by James B. Stewart, a columnist for The New York Times.
Now that many private equity firms have become public companies, they are under pressure to provide more reliable returns.
DealBook's Peter Lattman examined some of the problems facing private equity firms today: a potential tax increase, fundraising slowdowns and the aftermath of the buyout boom.
"These firms that were once castigated for being brash 'Barbarians at the Gate' are now staid asset managers selling a variety of financial products and services," said Kelly DePonte, a managing director at Probitas Partners, a company that raises money for private equity firms.
 On the Agenda: How are major forces in private equity and hedge funds shifting their focus? Can we get a good sense of where opportunity lies around the globe?
- Eric Owles 
 12:47 P.M. | Lunch! 
We're breaking for lunch, but we'll be back at 2 p.m. with Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates, David Rubenstein of the Carlyle Group and Stephen A. Schwarzman of the Blackstone Group.
- Eric Owles 
 12:39 P.M. | Preparing for an I.P.O.? 
Mr. Hardy asks about Twitter's plans for an initial public offering, but Mr. Costolo holds his cards close to the vest. He echoes a sentiment often heard in Silicon Valley, that an I.P.O. isn't what the company is focused on.
"I think of a public offering as a financing event for the company," he says.
- William Alden 
 12:34 P.M. | Advertising on Twitter 
Companies are still figuring out what it means to advertise on social media. Mr. Costolo gives an example. Tide, he says, seized an opportunity to build an advertising campaign around a viral photograph featuring the product, using a caption contest.
"They completely flipped upside down the way you would normally think about advertising: from, 'Let's do a 30-second spot and create buzz around it,' to, 'Let's take the buzz and generate a 30-second spot around it,'" he says.
- William Alden 
 12:28 P.M. | What Is Twitter, Anyway? 
Mr. Costolo describes Twitter is a global town square.
"In Ancient Greece you had the agora," Mr. Costolo says. "The news was exchanged and unfiltered by the participants in the news."
He adds: "These new technologies and disruptions are all about reducing the friction in time and space in getting the information out. But in reducing the friction in time and space, you lose the perspective."
- William Alden 
 12:20 P.M. | Twitter's Chief Talks Twitter 
Dick Costolo, the chief of Twitter, is talking with Mr. Hardy.
- Eric Owles 
 12:02 P.M. | On Education and Women 
Much of the innovation panel comes back to education. Mr. Moritz says the country's immigration policies are holding back development. "Every foreign-born student who comes to the United States to study would pursue a Ph.D. if given the opportunity," he says.
And the panelists also note that there has been a problem with drawing in other groups, like women, into math and the sciences, holding back some innovation. Mr. Moritz bemoans the historical discrimination that discouraged women from pursuing these increasingly important subject areas.
Ms. Shih remembers how there were relatively few women in her computer science classes at Stanford University, something that has since begun to change.
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 11:44 A.M. | Google's Chief on Disruptive Innovation 
Mr. Schmidt spends a lot of time these days thinking about innovation. And Silicon Valley has continued to be a font of disruptive change.
"Technology platforms are so pervasive that they literally upend their predecessors," he says.
It's a rate of change that is really fast, but Mr. Schmidt says one potential brake is the patent wars, in which Google is - he says - a reluctant participant. Patents can be important for smaller inventors, but in the hands of big corporations they become huge weapons. That can stymie nascent breakthroughs.
"If there's a person in this room who comes up with a brilliant new phone," he says, "where are you going to get the patents from? There are over 200,000 of them."
Another possible problem, Mr. Schmidt says, is that the United States is falling behind. He cites a recently published survey showing the country falling behind the likes of Singapore.
We have all these great sports rivalries in the United States, he says. "Here's the most important rivalry that we have, and we're not upset about it?"
The government is taking up the fight somewhat effectively, Mr. Schmidt asks, pointing to initiatives like the Education Department's Race to the Top. There is one issue, however. "As it turns out," he says, "in government you can't have any losers."
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 11:29 A.M. | Goldman's Next Leader 
Mr. Sorkin asks Mr. Blankfein if he has had enough of being chief executive. "Oh, I've had enough," Mr. Blankfein says. "Does that answer your question?"
"I come in every day and I'm happy to be with the people I work with and it's exciting," he says. "Would I like it better if I were at home watching you on TV every day? I don't think I'd like it that much."
Concerning the bank's next chief, he says: "I think it's a very high likelihood, close to 100 percent, that the next leader of Goldman Sachs is at Goldman Sachs."
- William Alden 
 11:27 A.M. | Google's Chief on the Search for Innovation 
Michael Moritz, the chairman of Sequoia Capital, Eric Schmidt, the chairman of Google, and Clara Shih, the chief executive of Hearsay Social, are discussing technology's economic impact with Quentin Hardy, deputy technology editor of The New York Times.
Google shares fell sharply in October after the company released a disappointing earnings report that reflected the challenges of mobile devices. 
 On the Agenda: Financial innovation in the last decade became a discredited notion, responsible for increased and misunderstood systemic risks. But in other sectors of the economy, notably technology, there is a thriving innovation economy, providing real impetus for economic growth and change.
 11:19 A.M. | Goldman and the News 
Mr. Sorkin asks Mr. Blankfein if he reads the newspaper these days, noting that in the past the Goldman chief has said his wife reads the paper for him.
"In some industries, they have their wife go out and start the car for them," Mr. Blankfein says, drawing laughs from the audience. "In my case, it's read the newspaper."
So, is he reading the paper himself now? "I am," he says. "Not every paper, but the papers."
- William Alden 
 11:16 A.M. | A World War II Analogy 
Mr. Blankfein offers an analogy on the state of the economy.
"I think we're like where the U.S. was and world was in 1944 when we were still fighting," he says. "We hadn't resolved how we were going to finish the war, but we already knew the war was going to be over."
He adds, "At that point, we were already preparing for the post-war world."
- William Alden 
 11:10 A.M. | If Lawmakers Were Business People 
Mr. Blankfein has been making the rounds in Washington lately as lawmakers haggle over the fiscal situation. His takeaway? The nation's capital is a "bizarre world," he says.
The nature of the negotiation is alien to the business world. If politicians were business people, Mr. Blankfein says, "I would say there would be a 100 percent chance of an agreement."
Any compromise, he says, would probably involve "a good dose of austerity."
- William Alden 
 11:00 A.M. | Blankfein on the New Wall Street 
Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief of Goldman Sachs, is answering questions from Mr. Sorkin. Mr. Blankfein endorsed higher tax rates in an opinion article published in The Wall Street Journal last month.
"I believe that tax increases, especially for the wealthiest, are appropriate, but only if they are joined by serious cuts in discretionary spending and entitlements."
 On the Agenda: What's really new on Wall Street? Have the pressures and regulations - national and global - effected change? Have we seen a reduction in systemic risk? Are financial institutions well-positioned to provide liquidity for the economy of the coming decade?
- Eric Owles 
 10:30 A.M. | Coffee! 
We're breaking for coffee, but we'll back in 30 minutes with Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs. Submit you questions and comments for the panel on Twitter at #DBConf.

 10:26 A.M. | Taxing A-Rod? 
What would a tax increase on the highest earners look like? Many of these people are sports or entertainment figures, Mr. Gordon says.
"It does not change economic growth to tax Alex Rodriguez or Oprah Winfrey at - forget 39.6 percent - how about 50 percent?" he says. "There's a huge opportunity to raise revenue there."
- William Alden 
 10:15 A.M. | A 'Point About Power' 
Mr. Hubbard delivers a laugh line: "My colleagues have made Power Points, and what I wanted to do was make a point about power."
Getting serious, he warns about politics.
"The idea of declinism has always been fashionable," he says. "Factually, if you look at history, virtually no great power declined because of some exogenous shift in its productivity. What happened in the stumble and the fall was politics not keeping up with economics."
- William Alden 
 10:04 A.M. | Dueling Visions on Growth 
With all the talk about ways to stimulate the economy, Washington, D.C., "feels these days like an economics insane asylum," Mr. Bernstein says.
But he lays out his own ideas for growth, using plenty of charts. Mr. Bernstein challenges the argument for tax reform and spending cuts. "I think this is the wrong to-do list, big time." Instead, he says, the nation should focus on "capital investment, particularly in I.T., with investment in public goods."
"The fact that we have the most unequal income distribution that we've had since the 1920s also factors into this," he adds. "It has to do with an underinvestment in the have-nots and a blocking of their economic opportunity."
But Mr. Hubbard, a prominent conservative, takes a different view, saying: "Tax reform is probably the biggest single weapon we have to encourage growth."
Still, Mr. Hubbard outlines some ideas that were absent from Mr. Romney's campaign platform. "If we move to a consumption tax in the U.S. that's progressive, we could probably increase output on the order of 7 to 10 percent," he said.
Tax reform, he says, "has to be a 2013 discussion."
- William Alden 
 9:44 A.M. | The Economic To-Do List 
Jared Bernstein, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities; Robert Gordon, a professor of economics at Northwestern University; and R. Glenn Hubbard, dean of the Columbia University Graduate School of Business, offer their predictions for the next four years of macroeconomics. Moderated by Annie Lowrey, an economic policy reporter for The New York Times.
Mr. Bernstein, an economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., wrote an Op-Ed in The New York Times this month, arguing for policies to raise America's underlying growth rate.
Mr. Gordon said in a recent research paper that the gains from the Internet have lessened in the last eight years.
And Mr. Hubbard, who was a top adviser to Mitt Romney, wrote an Op-Ed in the Financial Times recently arguing that the current fiscal debate is really a discussion about the size of the federal government.
 On the Agenda: Following the outcome of the general election, what is the macro outlook for the next four years? What is Wall Street's response to the promises of the new administration? What are the expectations for fiscal policy? What should be on the to-do list for the administration and Congress?
- Eric Owles 
 9:40 A.M. | Surveying the Technology World 
Everyone strongly suspects Apple is working on a television, which may come out in 2014 or maybe next year, Mr. Andreessen says.
There is a feeling in Silicon Valley that Apple has to crystallize the new category of smart TVs. The rhythm of the industry right now, he says, is that Apple has to go first. But other companies, like Google and Microsoft, will quickly follow.
Will Apple continue to lead? Mr. Andreessen says the company has to keep pumping out exciting new products. It is an issue Apple has confronted before, with Steven P. Jobs and without him. And it is one the company has to consider again.
He praises Google as firing on all cylinders. Android phones and tablets are doing really well, and heck, he's even excited about the self-driving car. (Like a kid in a candy store, Mr. Andreessen bops in his seat as he notes that the self-driving car is legal in California.)
Privacy laws: Before forging ahead, politicians should carefully study the effects of legislation that would govern how data is collected from users of Internet products.
Who's the next Steve Jobs? Mr. Andreessen - who very quickly disclaimed any claim to the title - says he doesn't think there is a new one. But he says Mr. Jobs is the model entrepreneurs in the Valley idolize, for having created and run the company for the long term, with users first in mind.
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 9:32 A.M. | Andreessen on a Tech Bubble 
Mr. Andreessen disputes the notion of a tech bubble. In some ways, he argues, the public market right now hates technology.
"One interpretation is, we're in a tech depression," he says. He notes that major technology companies like Intel and Cisco are trading at "generational lows," with price-to-earnings ratios at rock-bottom levels not seen since the 1970s.
Some tech giants are troubled by company-specific issues, he concedes. But there may be other issues at work.
"I think we're still dealing with broken trust from the 2000 crash," he says. "The 2000 crash was traumatizing."
And just when it looked like we were rebuilding that trust, he says, the financial crisis happened.
In some ways, though, that's O.K., he adds. It lets companies focus on their work, something that Mr. Andreessen says is an attitude his firm encourages, in part by delaying initial public offerings for as long as possible.
Well, what about Groupon, Mr. Sorkin asks? Mr. Andreessen declines to comment.
Hewlett-Packard is another topic Mr. Andreessen repeatedly ducks, since he is a director of the troubled tech company.
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 9:25 A.M. | Andreessen on Jobs and Unions 
Is there a place for unions in the economy? Mr. Andreessen says, "I think there's a time and a place when the economy is functioning." But in some ways it makes more sense when the country has more of a blue-collar economy than a white-collar one.
But, Mr. Andreessen says, "I do think there's something of a jobs crisis."
He illustrates the difference between Silicon Valley and the rest of the economy this way: "The old joke is, you can get a dozen job offers without getting out of your parking spot." He adds, "It's the ultimate job market of all time."
Mr. Sorkin asks what his two 2-year-olds should study in college if they want to make sure they can become gainfully employed. Mr. Andreessen says that math or science skills will be enormously valuable.
"A degree in English, I'm sure it's great," the investor says, "but the average college graduate with a degree in English can go work in a shoe store."
The American dream has long been about going to college and then getting a productive job. But that is now a misconception, Mr. Andreessen says. "It's not reflective of how the economy actually works."
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 9:20 A.M. | 'I'm Pro-Gridlock,' Andreessen Says 
Mr. Sorkin asks Mr. Andreessen about his comment that the nation should go over the fiscal cliff. Mr. Andreeseen grins and says, "I'm pro-gridlock."
Mr. Andreeseen, a free-market enthusiast, says he prefers the government to do less. There are going to be several crises in the next 25 Congressional cycles, he says. There will be fiscal cliffs and debt ceiling battles, and it is good for the country to fight.
"The last thing I want is for our politicians to band together and come up with a grand solution," Mr. Andreessen says. The last time Democrats and Republicans banded together, he adds, was the war on Iraq. That elicits a soft "ooh" from the crowd.
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 9:09 A.M. | Andreessen on the Triumph of Software 
Marc Andreessen, of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, and a co-founder of the first major Web browser, Netscape Navigator, is answering questions from Mr. Sorkin.
Earlier this year, Nicole Perlroth of The Times reported that the speed with which the venture firm "has rocketed to the top ranks has served as a case study in successful self-promotion."
- Eric Owles 
 9:08 A.M. | Treasury Secretary Dimon? 
Mr. Sorkin brings up Warren E. Buffett's recent comment that Mr. Dimon would make an excellent Treasury secretary, leading him to visibly squirm a little before issuing a fairly stout denial.
"I'm flattered," he says, "but I'm not suited to it."
Mr. Dimon adds, "I don't think a C.E.O. from Wall Street can get confirmed," drawing a few chuckles from the audience.
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 9:06 A.M. | Dimon on the 'London Whale' 
When Mr. Sorkin asks about JPMorgan's health, Mr. Dimon says that the trouble caused by the trading incident at the firm's chief investment office - arising when a huge position taken on by a trader known as the London Whale went sour - has been largely limited.
While it did lead to a shake-up of the firm's executive ranks some, Mr. Dimon says, it did not cause much damage.
"I think that the Whale accelerated certain things," he says. "It caused a little turmoil."
The team itself is excellent, with a deep bench, Mr. Dimon adds.
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 9:03 A.M. | Dimon Defends Bank Lobbyists 
After Mr. Sorkin asks about JPMorgan's "army of lobbyists," Mr. Dimon defends the banking industry's efforts. He says that of the 7,000 lobbying organizations in Washington, those working for the banking industry represent a small part of that number.
He mounts a defense rooted in the First Amendment, saying banks also have a right to have their concerns heard.
Mr. Dimon also rebuffs any insinuation that Wall Street has an unfair stranglehold on Washington. Banks, he says, can and should speak out, just as much as any other group.
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 9:00 A.M. | Dimon on Fracking 
Mr. Dimon tells the audience that he once spoke to a JPMorgan director, bemoaning the lack of an energy policy at the firm. The director responded, "We do have one. It's just a bad one."
The banking chief says that hydraulic fracturing, the drilling process commonly known as fracking, allows for an energy revolution. 
"The experts tell me, and I'm told it's been done this way for 30 years," he says. "Certainly safer than deep drilling in the gulf, safer than going overseas to fight wars."
Mr. Dimon says he "would be in favor, over time, for some sort of increase that would resemble a carbon tax."
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 8:57 A.M. | Dimon on Bank Scandals and Compensation 
When Mr. Sorkin asks Mr. Dimon about the spate of recent banking scandals, including the one that led HSBC to agree to pay a fine of nearly $2 billion, Mr. Dimon responds that while there are a few bad actors, such behavior is not endemic within his institution or the industry.
"No one at JPMorgan condones bad behavior," he says. He adds that when he was the chief executive of Bank One in Chicago, two sitting governors went to jail.
"You can't tar an entire institution because of a few bad people," he says.
With the conversation pivoting to compensation, Mr. Dimon says that while he will not disclose specifics, compensation will be measured this year. No special parachutes or other controversial payouts are in the offing, he says.
"Know where the best opportunities are?" Mr. Dimon asks. He knocks the table next to him. "It's right here."
He bemoans some problems, like troubles with the H-1B visa program that he says are shipping off qualified young immigrants back to their home countries.
That said, Mr. Dimon says there are plenty of opportunities elsewhere, which he says he is qualified to know, having recently traveled to China and India.
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 8:50 A.M. | Dimon and Obama 
Mr. Sorkin asks Mr. Dimon how his relationship is with the White House. "It's fine," the banking chief responds, drawing laughs from the audience. 
Mr. Dimon praises President Obama for reaching out and for going to the Business Roundtable. "Collaboration is always better," he says. "It's better for the country. If we can't be great, we won't be great."
That said, Mr. Dimon adds, Wall Street will be able to adapt no matter the circumstances.
- Michael J. de la Merced 
 8:40 A.M. | Dimon on the Global Climate for Finance 
Jamie Dimon, the chief of JPMorgan Chase, is answering questions from Mr. Sorkin. Mr. Dimon has been shaking up the bank's management after a multibillion-dollar trading loss this year.
- Eric Owles 
 8:33 A.M. | Welcome From Sulzberger and Sorkin 
Arthur Sulzberger Jr., the chairman of The New York Times, and Andrew Ross Sorkin, editor at large of DealBook, are welcoming the crowd at The Times Center.

HEADLINE: The Meaning of Minority

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
America's white majority just bought itself another year.
According to census figures released Wednesday, 2043 is now the year that whites will no longer make up the majority of Americans. That's one year later than previous projections.
But one year is nothing in the grand sweep of things. We as a society must begin to consider now what this change will mean for a nation mired in a majority/minority swamp of privilege, expectations, historical benefits and systematic discrimination. 
The browning of America is very real and unrelenting. Our task is to find a way to move into this new Ecru Era with as much ease and grace as we can muster.
An April 2011 report from the Metropolitan Policy Program (M.P.P.) at the Brookings Institution found that all but two of the 10 largest metro areas in the country have child populations in which white children are a minority. (Boston and Philadelphia were the exceptions.) Of the remaining eight metro areas, Hispanic children are the largest demographic in six, and blacks are the largest in the other two.
As Hua Hsu, a professor at Vassar College, posited in The Atlantic in 2009: ''What will the new mainstream of America look like, and what ideas or values might it rally around? What will it mean to be white after 'whiteness' no longer defines the mainstream? Will anyone mourn the end of white America? Will anyone try to preserve it?''
These are epic questions about a seismic shift in American demography. How should we consider a waning majority when their privilege of numbers gives way to what many other Americans have experienced as the minority plight?
On election night, Fox News' Bill O'Reilly said that ''the white establishment is now the minority.'' The question is whether this should be a reason for lamentation or celebration. Or neither.
In September, a white student named Matthew Heimbach at Towson University caused a bit of an uproar when The Baltimore Sun reported that he was ''gathering support'' to start a white student union on campus. The newspaper pointed out: ''His former group, Youth for Western Civilization, had sparked controversy with its public displays against Islam, same-sex marriage and multicultural education. That group disbanded after it lost the support of its faculty sponsor, but Heimbach said he hopes his new organization will promote white identity without disparaging other people.''
(It should be noted that Towson's campus is in Maryland, one of the states in which the M.P.P. found the white child population to be less than 50 percent, and is on the outskirts Baltimore, where whites are only 31.5 percent of the population, according to the Census Bureau.)
Now, putting Youth for Western Civilization's intolerance aside for a moment (if that's possible), we must ask: when will public displays of white pride become culturally acceptable? Will they forever be freighted with the weight of history -- tantamount to gloating about privilege? Or should all racial and cultural pride be viewed more or less the same?
The Sun quoted Heimbach as saying, ''It comes a point where we're not directly involved in what happened centuries ago and our culture just perpetuates the guilt cycle.'' He continued, ''We want to provide a positive view of white identity.''
Is that offensive? Or fair play in light of where the country is heading?
And what of O'Reilly's ''white establishment''? Power is a precious commodity. It is rarely voluntarily surrendered, particularly by those who believe they have earned it. The task is to expand the franchise without casting some people as givers and others as takers. That is harder than it sounds.
There will most likely be a growing rub between traditional power structures and emerging ones, much of which will be visible along racial lines but also along gender and sexual identity lines. A great deal of that friction boils down to simple economics. As a July 2011 Pew Research Center report pointed out: ''The median wealth of white households is 20 times that of black households and 18 times that of Hispanic households.'' Women and gays also earn less than their male and heterosexual counterparts.
This wealth disparity plays into the national debate about the role of government, appropriate spending levels and rates of taxation.
And on a worrisome note, a recent Associated Press poll showed that since Barack Obama was elected in 2008, prejudice toward blacks has increased. According to the report: ''In all, 51 percent of Americans now express explicit anti-black attitudes, compared with 48 percent in a similar 2008 survey. When measured by an implicit racial attitudes test, the number of Americans with anti-black sentiments jumped to 56 percent, up from 49 percent during the last presidential election. In both tests, the share of Americans expressing pro-black attitudes fell.''
Furthermore, The A.P. found: ''Most Americans expressed anti-Hispanic sentiments, too. In an A.P. survey done in 2011, 52 percent of non-Hispanic whites expressed anti-Hispanic attitudes. That figure rose to 57 percent in the implicit test. The survey on Hispanics had no past data for comparison.''
The last thing we need is a racial and ethnic backlash in this country. Now is the time to move forward with sensitivity and respect and with a watchful eye on how we behave and what we expect as the traditional American majority becomes just another minority.

HEADLINE: Ex-Regulator Will Guide Barclays' Compliance

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
LONDON - Barclays appointed Hector Sants, Britain's former top financial regulator, as head of compliance on Wednesday, as part of an effort to repair the bank's image after a rate-rigging scandal. 
With the appointment of Mr. Sants, who is also a former UBS investment banker, Barclays hopes to benefit from his experience working with many of the world's financial regulators. Mr. Sants stepped down as chief executive of the British regulator, the Financial Services Authority, in June.
That same month, Barclays agreed to a $450 million settlement with American and British authorities over charges that some of its traders reported false interest rates for financial gain. The case led to the resignation of several top executives, including Robert E. Diamond Jr., the bank's chief.
The scandal also prompted questions about the role of the Financial Services Authority in policing big banks. In 2008, a Barclays employee told the authority that the bank was lowering its submissions for the London interbank offered rate, or Libor, although Barclays never specifically said the activities amounted to manipulation.
Since the summer, Barclays has moved to rethink its compliance and risk-taking activities. It has begun a review of its risky trading operations and was expected to announce an overhaul of many of its business units in time for its next earnings statement in February.
As head of compliance and government and regulatory relations, Mr. Sants will oversee compliance across all of the bank's operations and report directly to the chief executive, Antony P. Jenkins. He will start at the beginning of 2013.
"Relationships with our regulators and governments around the world are obviously also of critical importance to us," Mr. Jenkins said in a statement on Wednesday. "We must apply a renewed leadership focus on these to make them as constructive and productive as possible."
The Financial Services Authority has faced harsh criticism from British politicians, who said it did not do enough to monitor risky trading activity in London's financial services sector.
In tense testimony before Parliament this year, Adair Turner, the former chairman of the authority, was questioned about the culture at Barclays that led to the rate-rigging scandal.
In April, Mr. Turner had written to Marcus Agius, then the chairman of Barclays, about what the regulator perceived as overly aggressive practices by the bank. The concerns focused on efforts to avoid paying about $770 million in corporate taxes and on some of the bank's accounting methods.
"Barclays often seems to be seeking to gain advantage through the use of complex structures, or through regulatory approaches which are at the aggressive end of interpretation of the relevant rules and regulations," Mr. Turner wrote, according to documents released by Parliament.
Mr. Sants did raise early concerns about the culture at Barclays. After Mr. Diamond was appointed as the bank's chief executive, the authority warned the Barclays board that he had "not reached the level of openness, transparency and willingness to air issues" with regulators, according to an e-mail.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: 'Daily Show' Is Policy Time For a Mayor

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
While many mayors suffer in relatively anonymity, there is a good chance that you have heard of Cory A. Booker of Newark. If you, say, turn on a television, or are on Twitter, you have probably heard that he spent the last week eating burned sweet potatoes while on his food-stamps diet, that he pulled a woman from a burning building, that during snowstorms he shovels out perhaps every snowbound car in his beleaguered New Jersey city. 
On Wednesday, in an appearance on ''The Daily Show With Jon Stewart'' that was promoted among the mayor's 1.3 million Twitter followers, Mr. Booker displayed his wonky side, discussing the gross national product, prisoner re-entry and income inequality.
Mr. Stewart called him ''the superhero mayor of Newark.''
''You pull babies out of burning buildings, you have reversed the rotation of the earth to save Lois Lane. How does this happen to you? Do you patrol at night? Are you filming an episode of 'Cops'?''
Mr. Booker, a Democrat, demurred, saying he got ''attention for things that, frankly, a lot of people in my city do every day.''
In discussing the achievement gap between black and white students, he urged Mr. Stewart to go home and Google ''McKinsey, 2009, disparity, education.''
But he did not answer some questions that his home state is asking: Will he run against Gov. Chris Christie (a Republican who appeared on Mr. Stewart's Comedy Central show last week)? Will he run instead for the Senate in 2014, when Frank R. Lautenberg's term is up? Or will he merely continue to leap tall buildings in a single bound?
Mr. Booker called Mr. Christie ''a good friend'' but said they disagreed on matters of policy like the earned-income tax credit and the importance of investing in infrastructure. ''New Jersey has a problem with its Transportation Trust Fund,'' the mayor declared.
''What?'' Mr. Stewart asked, mockingly.
As Mr. Booker talked about bringing together left and right, Mr. Stewart, himself raised in New Jersey, insisted, ''I will break through your veneer of optimism.''
Mr. Booker said, ''Our best days are not behind us if we start working together for what we know is right.''
''I'm sorry to see you so discouraged and giving up politics,'' Mr. Stewart told him.

HEADLINE: Boehner Tries to Contain Defections on Fiscal Unity

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN; Jackie Calmes contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Speaker John A. Boehner moved Wednesday to maintain Republican unity on deficit reduction talks as lawmakers on the far right openly chafed at his leadership and some pragmatists pressed for quick accommodation on tax rate increases on the rich.
Other lawmakers and aides to the speaker maintained that Republicans, both in the leadership and in the broader Republican conference, remain strongly unified behind Mr. Boehner as he tries to reach a deal with President Obama to stave off a potential fiscal crisis less than three weeks away. 
Without a deal, hundreds of billions of dollars in automatic tax increases and spending cuts will kick in next month, possibly dragging the nation back into recession.
But the House's most conservative members vowed to vote against any deal that raises taxes, openly challenging the speaker's authority. Representative Jeff Landry of Louisiana, defeated in a House race decided last week, blamed the speaker for creating the perilous fiscal position the nation finds itself in. A senior Democrat suggested Mr. Boehner was dragging his feet on deficit talks to avoid striking a deal before January, when the House formally chooses its next speaker.
''The biggest impediment right now is the speaker's ability to get a decent number of Republican votes for an agreement,'' said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, who is the lead Democrat on the House Budget Committee.
''I'm getting increasingly concerned that one of the reasons the speaker is deciding to, I think, string out these discussions is that he wants to wait until Jan. 3, when the election for speaker takes place,'' he said.
The Republican dissenters at this point represent a small portion of the House Republican Conference, but their public anger is striking. It also reflects a storm of criticism Mr. Boehner is facing on conservative talk radio and Internet outlets, in part for moving toward the president on taxes, in part for embracing a purge that removed four Republicans who consistently dissented from leadership positions of committees.
Representative Tim Huelskamp, Republican of Kansas, who was removed from the Agriculture Committee, said the vast majority of his district wants him to oppose Mr. Boehner's re-election as speaker.
Representative Justin Amash, Republican of Michigan and another subject of the committee purge, said, ''If Speaker Boehner wants to come back to my district, he's not going to be met with very much welcome.''
In another twist, some of the House's most uncompromising conservatives joined ranks with its most ardent liberals in embracing a ride into the fiscal unknown next month. Representative Steve King, Republican of Iowa, said the across-the-board spending cuts to military and domestic programs would ''break the mold and get some real cuts for a change.''
Representative Cynthia M. Lummis, Republican of Wyoming, compared fears of a fiscal crisis to hysteria over the end of the Mayan calendar later this month.
''A bad deal is worse than no deal at all,'' she said. ''What is being made of this fiscal cliff is too much.''
Republican leadership aides dismissed such talk as the incessant grumbling of a group that has made dissent a sport. Michael Steel, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner, called Mr. Van Hollen's assertion ''nutty.''
Representative Kevin Brady, Republican of Texas, said, ''The speaker's got us very unified.''
With his bargaining position already tenuous, Mr. Boehner needs a unified party behind him if he is to hold out for a conservative deficit deal, leaders told the Republican conference on Wednesday. Concern on his right flank may be keeping him from moving toward a deal. The latest counterproposal from the speaker to the president on Tuesday did not move an inch off his position of $800 billion in revenue increases over 10 years, achieved through an overhaul of the tax code without tax rate increases.
In private talks with the president, Mr. Boehner assured him he would be willing to increase the total amount of tax increases in his offer higher than the $800 billion over 10 years he initially laid out. But he added that such a concession would come only if Mr. Obama significantly increased the amount he is willing to cut in spending, a leadership aide said Wednesday. The speaker said the president's opening bid on spending cuts was not even large enough to justify the speaker's $800 billion in revenue increases, the aide said.
A White House official said the president reiterated his request that Mr. Boehner detail what cuts he wants. He still has not.
Even before conservatives began speaking out of turn, pragmatists were pressing the leadership to take up and pass a Senate Democratic bill to extend expiring middle-class tax cuts, which would most likely ensure that tax rates would rise on the rich.
Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, went to the Senate floor on Tuesday night to say his party should accept tax rate increases on the top 2 percent of households now, then battle Mr. Obama on spending early next year when Congress must raise the government's statutory borrowing limit or risk a debilitating government debt default.
Republicans could also use as leverage the expiration in March of the ''continuing resolution'' -- or C.R. -- that is keeping the government operating.
''Where we may be headed is toward the end of this month rescuing the 98 percent, putting that issue over to the side and then using the debt ceiling or the C.R. as that forcing moment to cause us to finally come to terms with this fiscal issue,'' Mr. Corker said.
The speaker expressed frustration with the president's position, and suggested that lawmakers prepare for a spoiled holiday season. Representative John Shimkus of Illinois emerged from the weekly meeting of the House Republican Conference to say the speaker's message was ''keep your Christmas decorations up and make no plans.''
Democrats, eager to exploit cracks in the Republican ranks, dared the speaker on Wednesday to bring up the Senate-passed middle-class tax cut extension using expedited rules that would take a two-thirds vote to pass.

HEADLINE: After the Boom, a Better Kind of Art

BYLINE: By JULIE LASKY

 BODY:
MIAMI BEACH
SAY the words ''design art'' to Didier Krzentowski, and he makes a funny noise in his throat, as if something is stuck there. You don't have to speak French to understand that Mr. Krzentowski, a founder of Galerie Kreo in Paris, is expressing disdain.
We were at Design Miami, the annual show of design art, or limited-edition furniture and accessories, that ended on Sunday. The event began in 2005 as a satellite to Art Basel in Miami Beach, to attract elite collectors who want a rarefied sofa to go with their Gerhard Richter.
This year, Galerie Kreo was introducing a bookcase by François Bauchet. The work, called Cellae 9, had the look of thinly sliced gray marble but was made of felt impregnated with resin. Only eight were produced, plus two artist's proofs. The price was about $29,000. (Like many of the figures quoted in this article, that may rise as the number of available pieces declines.) 
Mr. Krzentowski, who founded Kreo in 1999 with his wife, Clémence, has long worked with designers to produce objects that have the conceptual depth and rarity of fine art. But he dislikes the idea of lumping art and design into a single category. The pieces he sells are experimental, but they are not freewheeling in the way of many artworks; they have a function or at least allude to one. ''Design means constraints,'' he said approvingly.
The funny throat noise may have also come from the fact that, for many, the term ''design art'' means pretentious and opportunistic.
Blame the art boom. When limited-edition design was canonized as a serious collectible a few years ago (about the time an aluminum lounge chair by Marc Newson fetched nearly $1 million at auction), galleries took notice. Pieces by emerging designers were touted as blue chip investments. ''Editions of 10'' appeared in 10 different colors, diminishing rarity with every hue.
Like the rest of the art market, design art crashed with the economy, and for the most part, it has remained grounded. A version of a Ron Arad rocking chair called Loop Loom, which in 2006 sold at auction in Paris for $160,000, went for $75,000 at Phillips de Pury in New York on Tuesday, $5,000 below the low estimate.
That's the economic picture. The creative picture is something else. Design Miami showed that design art (or whatever you want to call it) is thriving. The 36 exhibitors included not only contemporary-design veterans like Kreo, R 20th Century of New York and Nilufar of Milan, but also several newly hatched galleries.
Dealers reported satisfying sales, especially now that the fair is across the parking lot from the Miami Beach Convention Center, where Art Basel is based. Until three years ago, the event took place about five miles away, in a retail sector developed as the Miami Design District -- not as easy a trek for the Richter-owning sofa buyer. This year, the fair's organizers reported that more than 30,000 people visited over five days.
MOST impressive, Design Miami had a vigor that was missing from Art Basel, which was seven times its size. ''Because it's smaller, I have more space to play and more space to say something,'' said Sebastian Errazuriz, whose work was shown by the New York contemporary design dealer Cristina Grajales and was also part of an exhibition of outdoor benches that Ms. Grajales organized at the Fairchild Tropical Botanic Garden in Coral Gables, Fla. Mr. Errazuriz designed one bench with a crystal chandelier ($24,000) and another with a pair of Julius Caesar busts ($20,000).
''Design art has so much growth potential where I'm fortunate to be a spearhead of this new movement,'' Mr. Errazuriz said.
''Meanwhile, in the arts,'' he said, ''it's so difficult to find something that stands out and proposes something new anymore.''
The fair offered a bracing combination of living design legends like Wendell Castle and Gaetano Pesce, vintage masters like the Eameses and Jean Prouvé, and younger talents (like the Chilean-born Mr. Errazuriz, 35), whom gallerists say have established their bona fides though museum collections or monographs.
Gabrielle Ammann of Cologne, for instance, showed a $75,000 marble chair and ottoman by Satyendra Pakhalé, 45, an Amsterdam-based designer, alongside products by the better-known Rolf Sachs and Ron Arad. Mr. Pakhalé's work has been acquired by the Victoria and Albert Museum, she noted.
Maria Wettergren of Paris, a specialist in contemporary Scandinavian design, offered a chair by Mathias Bengtsson, 41, a Danish-born Londoner. The piece, which was 3-D printed in resin to resemble the cellular structure of bone and coated in silver, was priced at about $65,200. Mr. Bengtsson is not a household name, but he has been widely published in the design press.
Still, there was skepticism at Design Miami that untested designers would hold their value. Predictably, this attitude came from dealers in vintage goods, like Mark McDonald of Hudson, N.Y., a respected veteran of midcentury modern furniture, who was showing early-1950s Eames pieces. ''My whole career has been built on track record and what things sell for in the open market, not what a gallerist is promoting as the hottest thing,'' he said.
Among the fresh faces were those belonging to the exhibitors themselves. Volume Gallery, which was founded two and a half years ago in Chicago by Claire Warner and Sam Vinz, made its maiden exhibition with the deconstructed furniture of Snarkitecture, a collaboration of Alex Mustonen, 31, an architect, and Daniel Arsham, 32, an artist. (Snarkitecture also designed ''Drift,'' the installation at the entrance of the Design Miami tent, a canopy of elongated white balloons that looked as if they were begging to be twisted into large albino dachshunds.)
The Snarkitechture pieces included a cabinet of lacquered wood and cast silicone that gave the appearance of having been whacked by a cleaver. There were also corner shelves that looked like fragments of broken plaster. The collection was priced between $5,000 and $20,000. As of the second day of the event, Mr. Vinz said, he had sold a $5,000 stool and had requests to hold other pieces.
OVER ALL, prices were not hair-raising. A star turn like the America table by Gaetano Pesce, 73, an 11-foot-wide map of the United States in painted epoxy resin set on legs that spelled the word ''Independence,'' was $155,000. (The table, a one-off, was exhibited by Erastudio Apartment-Gallery of Milan.) Nearby, a surrealist pair of entangled street lamps with blobs of illuminated glass, by Pieke Bergmans, 34, a Dutch designer working with Venice Projects of Italy, was $130,000 in an edition of three.
That may sound like a lot of money, but not when you think of the several months required to construct a mold for the trio of lamps, cast the metal and blow the glass, tossing out failed efforts at every stage. Or when you cross the parking lot separating Design Miami from Art Basel and find in the Chelsea dealer Andrea Rosen's booth a string of little illuminated white light bulbs on a wire. That 1993 work, '''Untitled' (Last Light),'' by the artist Félix González-Torres, was priced at $550,000.
Paul Johnson, the owner of Johnson Trading Gallery, in New York and Los Angeles, was the rare dealer to exhibit at both Design Miami and Art Basel, thanks to a collection of vintage furniture painted by the late artist and ''picker'' Robert Loughlin ($3,000 to $9,000). This dual showing was permitted, he said, because the work was indisputably functional. (Design Miami bars objects that have no apparent use.)
By Thursday, Mr. Johnson had sold pieces in fairly equal quantities at both fairs, he said, including a $6,500 Mies Brno chair to the Carnegie Museum adorned with Mr. Loughlin's standard iconography: a square-jawed man with a cigarette dangling from his lip, a Zippo lighter and a Chevrolet logo.
The layers of reference -- 1980s East Village graffiti on top of 1930s-style found classic furniture -- produced a richness that emanates from the best mashups of design and art.
Mr. Errazuriz, the designer, pointed out the philosophical and emotional potential of the conjoined disciplines. ''We have our basic necessities covered,'' he said, referring to objects like coffee tables and benches that help us eat, socialize and relax.
Now the mandate is to ''design something for when I feel lonely,'' he added. ''For when I feel empty. For when I'm turned down by my love. For when I'm scared because I'm going to die. For when I lose a kid. Design now is fulfilling important things that for a long time were more expected from art, but that art today is failing to deliver because it's so immersed in itself.''

HEADLINE: Police Search Deutsche Bank Offices in Germany

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT - After a raid at Deutsche Bank's headquarters, the company disclosed Wednesday that two of its highest-ranking executives were a focus of a tax evasion investigation, dealing a fresh blow to the German institution's already battered reputation.
German authorities are looking into whether bank employees conspired to avoid sales tax on the trading of carbon emission certificates. As part of that inquiry, prosecutors are trying to determine whether Jürgen Fitschen, the co-chief executive, and Stefan Krause, the chief financial officer, played a role in signing certain tax forms. 
On Wednesday, about 500 police officers searched Deutsche Bank offices in Frankfurt, Düsseldorf and Berlin, as well as private homes. The police arrested five people, who were not identified. Those arrested did not include Mr. Fitschen or Mr. Krause.
Deutsche Bank said it was cooperating with the authorities but added that it had already revised the reporting of value-added tax in question. "Unlike the Public Prosecutor's Office, Deutsche Bank is of the opinion that this correction took place in due time," the bank said in a statement. It declined to comment further.
Top executives sign many documents, and it was not clear whether prosecutors believed that Mr. Fitschen and Mr. Krause were knowingly involved in an attempt to avoid taxes. Prosecutors could not be reached for comment late Wednesday.
The investigation only complicates the bank's turnaround efforts.
Like its rivals, Deutsche Bank is struggling in the face of the European debt crisis, weak economic conditions and new regulation. The bank could be hit particularly hard by new rules taking effect in the coming years that require banks to increase the amount of capital they hold as a cushion against losses. Deutsche Bank has acknowledged that it needs to bolster its reserves.
At the same time, Mr. Fitschen and Anshu Jain, the other co-chief executive, have been trying to improve the bank's image. In September, Mr. Fitschen and Mr. Jain announced a broad effort to raise ethical standards. Acknowledging that the bank had made mistakes, the executives promised to reduce risk, set more modest profit goals and reduce employee bonuses.
But those efforts have been stymied by a series of legal issues.
The bank is among the institutions under investigation by the authorities in the United States and Europe over the possible manipulation of crucial benchmarks, like the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. In May, Deutsche Bank agreed to pay $202 million to settle claims by the United States Department of Justice that a bank subsidiary had filed false information to qualify for federal mortgage insurance. The bank is also the target of multiple lawsuits in the United States related to its sales of securities linked to the mortgage market.
While bank executives appeared to be surprised by the raid on Wednesday, the underlying allegations had been known for several years.
Since 2005, the European Union has set allowances for energy producers, manufacturers and other companies that produce carbon dioxide and other gases. Companies that do not use all their allowances may sell them, a system intended to give the companies an incentive to reduce their emissions.
The European Commission has repeatedly made changes to the system that are intended to prevent abuses. In the past, traders have collected value-added tax from customers but failed to pass the money on to governments.
In October, the Süddeutsche Zeitung, a newspaper in Munich, reported that Deutsche Bank fired five traders in connection with irregularities in carbon trading. The bank has not denied the report.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Fed Ties Rates To Joblessness; 6.5% Is Target

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve made it plain on Wednesday that job creation had become its primary focus, announcing that it planned to continue suppressing interest rates so long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent.
It was the first time the nation's central bank had publicized such a specific economic objective, underscoring the depth of its concern about the persistence of what the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, called ''a waste of human and economic potential.''
To help reduce unemployment, the Fed said it would also continue monthly purchases of $85 billion in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities until job market conditions improved, extending a policy announced in September.
But the Fed released new economic projections showing that most of its senior officials did not expect to reach the goal of 6.5 percent unemployment until the end of 2015, raising questions of why it was not moving to expand its economic stimulus campaign. 
At a news conference after a two-day meeting of the bank's top policy committee, Mr. Bernanke suggested that the Fed was approaching the limits of its ability to help the unemployed.
''If we could wave a magic wand and get unemployment down to 5 percent tomorrow, obviously we would do that,'' he said when asked if the Fed could do more. ''But there are constraints in terms of the dynamics of the economy, in terms of the power of these tools and in terms that we do need to take into account other costs and risks that might be associated with a large expansion of our balance sheet,'' referring to the monthly purchases of securities.
The changes announced Wednesday continue a shift that began in September, when the Fed announced that it would buy mortgage bonds until the job market generally improved.
As it did in September, the Fed sought to make clear on Wednesday that it was not responding to new evidence of economic problems, but increasing its efforts to address existing problems that have restrained growth for more than three years.
In focusing on job creation, the Fed is breaking with its long history of treating the inflation rate as the primary focus of a central bank. But the Fed is charged by Congress with both controlling inflation and minimizing unemployment. And over the last year, a group of officials led by Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, convinced their colleagues that the Fed was falling short on the unemployment front.
The unemployment rate in November was 7.7 percent -- it has not been below 6.5 percent since September 2008 -- while the rate of inflation in recent months is lower than the 2 percent annual rate that the Fed considers healthiest.
''Imagine that inflation was running at 5 percent against our inflation objective of 2 percent,'' Mr. Evans said in a September 2011 speech first describing the proposal. ''Is there a doubt that any central banker worth their salt would be reacting strongly to fight this high inflation rate? No, there isn't any doubt. They would be acting as if their hair was on fire. We should be similarly energized about improving conditions in the labor market.''
That argument was easier to win because inflation is under control, and the Fed expects the pace of price increases to remain at or below 2 percent through 2015. But in perhaps the clearest indication of the Fed's philosophical shift, the Federal Open Market Committee said Wednesday that it would not relent in its focus on unemployment unless the medium-term outlook for inflation rose above 2.5 percent.
The change was supported by 11 of the committee's 12 members. The only dissent came from Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, who has repeatedly called for the Fed to do less. He says he believes the policies are ineffective and could inhibit the central bank's ability to control inflation.
The Fed has held short-term interest rates near zero since December 2008, and it said in September that it intended to do so until at least mid-2015. The forecast was intended to reduce borrowing costs by persuading investors that interest rates would remain low for longer than they might have expected.
Mr. Bernanke said Wednesday that the shift to economic targets was not significant in the short term because the Fed still expected its goals to be reached no sooner than mid-2015. He said the bank chose 6.5 percent as its target because analyses showed that full-throttle stimulus beyond that level of unemployment could result in higher inflation.
Stock prices jumped after the Fed released its policy statement at midday, then began falling during Mr. Bernanke's news conference about two hours later as he insisted that the Fed was not significantly increasing its efforts to bolster the economy. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 0.04 percent on the day.
Some of Mr. Bernanke's colleagues, and some outside economists, argue that telling investors how the economic situation must change in order to warrant a shift in policy might be more convincing, and more potent, than publishing an estimated endpoint.
''The accommodation switch has been turned on,'' wrote Michael Gapen, senior United States economist at Barclays. He added that the new guidelines ''could very well overcome some of the previous confusion surrounding date-based policy rate guidance.''
The Fed's asset purchases are intended to reinforce the impact of its interest rate policies in a manner akin to removing seats from a game of musical chairs. Would-be investors in Treasuries and mortgage bonds are forced to compete for the remaining supply by accepting lower interest rates -- that is, they are forced to pay up front a larger share of the money they are entitled to receive as the bond matures, lowering costs for borrowers.
The Fed announced in September that it would expand its holdings of mortgage-backed securities by about $40 billion a month. Those purchases joined the bank's earlier commitment to buy about $45 billion in Treasury securities each month through the end of December, which has now been extended indefinitely. But instead of financing the purchases by selling short-term Treasuries, the Fed will credit banks that sell the bonds with new reserves, essentially creating money, as it now does in purchasing mortgage bonds.
It decided not to increase the scale of purchases, however, in part because it did not want to undermine the private market by soaking up too much of the available supply -- one of the constraints Mr. Bernanke mentioned on Wednesday.
The forecasts published Wednesday show that Fed officials expect the economy to expand 2.3 percent to 3 percent in 2013, slightly below the September forecast of 2.5 percent to 3 percent. Fed officials have repeatedly overestimated the health of the economy and the pace of the recovery, and the latest changes, while relatively small, continue that pattern.
The forecasts remain optimistic in at least one respect: they assume that Congress and the White House will reach a deal to avert scheduled tax increases and spending cuts next year. If that does not happen, Fed officials agree that the impact of the bank's stimulus campaign will be trivial in comparison to the consequences, and the economy will most likely return to recession.

HEADLINE: Why the Reset Should Be Reset

BYLINE: By THOMAS E. GRAHAM and DMITRI TRENIN

 BODY:
AS President Obama approaches his second term, few foreign policies are more in need of reassessment than his stance toward Russia.
Recent events have eroded the promise of the ''reset'' proclaimed in 2009. Its achievements -- the New START Treaty, cooperation on Afghanistan and Iran, Russia's entry into the World Trade Organization -- have faded, replaced by stubborn differences over Syria, Iran and other high-profile issues amid rising, gratuitously antagonistic rhetoric in both capitals.
Obama will now try to reverse this deterioration, perhaps demonstrating some of the ''flexibility'' he promised Russian leaders earlier this year. Putin, for his part, has talked about giving the relations ''a new quality'' by adding a strong economic dimension. We may hear talk of a second phase of the reset. There may be more deals of the kind ExxonMobil struck with Rosneft. 
But glib formulations and major energy projects should not cover up the fundamental choice the two administrations face: to continue their transactional approach to relations, with their inevitable ups and downs, or to put relations in a broader, longer-term strategic framework, which could foster more enduring constructive relations.
A choice in favor of the former faces two problems.
First, it is hard to see where progress can be made in the next four years.
Deeper nuclear-arms cuts, a U.S. priority, will harden Russian concerns about U.S. missile defense and nonnuclear strategic systems, while approaching the threshold at which Chinese, Indian and Pakistani forces begin to affect the global nuclear balance.
Putin's recent preference for trade and investment requires a qualitatively different business climate in Russia, including the de facto rule of law and competent, honest governance. Fruitful cooperation on regional conflicts, as Syria has demonstrated, requires dealing with the age-old principles of world order, sovereignty and noninterference in internal affairs, and the growing Western preference to use force to protect foreign populations from brutal leaders.
The United States will not revert to realpolitik, and Russia will not give up its support for the traditional order. Overall, there will be no easy trade-offs.
Second, domestic political conditions in neither country are conducive to pursuing such trade-offs. Incensed by Washington's insistence on dealing simultaneously with the Russian government and Russian society, Putin has taken steps -- from branding foreign-funded non-governmental organizations as ''foreign agents'' to ending the U.S. Agency for International Development's 20 years of work in Russia -- that do not make it politically easier for Obama to sell closer engagement with Moscow.
The Magnitsky Act, calling for sanctions against Russian officials who violate human rights, establishes a precedent which, in theory at least, can be expanded to include any senior member of the current regime.
By contrast, a strategic approach would start with the geopolitical transformation now underway across the globe and ask how each country could become a strategic asset for the other.
Russia, if only by virtue of geography, and the United States, because of its global reach, could exercise significant influence over the emergence of a new geopolitical balance in Eurasia. The two countries' strategic interests do not necessarily collide; indeed, there is probably a significant overlap, given common concerns about China, Islamic extremists and competition for Arctic resources by non-Arctic powers.
Moreover, there is a significant economic component to all these balances that could encourage the productive relations with the United States that are critical to Russia's becoming a modern economy -- one of Russia's prime national strategic objectives.
The question arises then how the United States and Russia could each harness relations to its own strategic purposes.
So far, both the U.S. administration and the Kremlin have resisted taking a strategic approach. In her article in Foreign Policy a year ago on the ''pivot'' toward Asia, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton did not once mention Russia, even though Russia was then preparing to act as host to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit meeting in Vladivostok in September 2012 in part to underscore its determination to return as an Asian power, and was playing a vital role in supplying American forces in Afghanistan. Putin canceled his participation in last May's Group of 8 summit meeting at Camp David at the last moment, something no world leader had done before.
On the U.S. side, this oversight grows in part out of the discomfort America has with the very idea of Russian power, grounded in the long Cold-War struggle. Having confronted malevolent Soviet power for so long, America resists the idea that Russia could ever have a positive role in American strategic interests.
On the Russian side, there is still great resentment over the way the United States treated Russia after the end of the Cold War, and a fair amount of suspicion that U.S. policy is aimed at weakening Russia today.
It is time to begin overcoming this mutual discomfort and mistrust. Two decades after the Cold War, the United States and Russia are no longer strategic rivals, and in the emerging multipolar world they could be partners.
This is a proposition that now needs to be tested. The two countries need to engage in a high-level strategic dialogue to understand the dynamics of our changing world and the ways in which they impact on each country's strategic interests, and to determine whether there is sufficient overlap in these interests for a long-term cooperative relationship.
There is no guarantee that we would reach agreement. Indeed, a strategic dialogue could reveal unbridgeable differences. But the potential benefits of strategic cooperation justify the effort.

HEADLINE: If Mercury Pollution Knows No Borders, Neither Can Its Solution

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH

 BODY:
AUSTIN, TEXAS -- The harm that can be caused by consuming or breathing mercury is well known and terrible. A pregnant woman, eating too much of the wrong kind of fish, risks bearing a child with neurological damage. Adults or children exposed to mercury can experience mood swings or tremors, or sometimes even respiratory failure or death.
In January, representatives of dozens of countries will gather in Geneva to discuss combating mercury emissions, which are rising in Asia even as Europe and the United States have tightened controls. The meeting is the last of five negotiating rounds -- the first took place in 2010 in Stockholm -- and a legally binding treaty on mercury contamination is expected to come together next year. 
The signing of that treaty is set to take place in the Japanese city of Minamata, where widespread mercury poisoning occurred in the mid-20th century after discharges from a factory contaminated the seawater.
But the extent to which countries will commit to reducing mercury, and whether they will follow through on those commitments, are open questions.
''What remains to be seen is the stringency of the requirements,'' said Noelle Eckley Selin, an assistant professor of engineering systems and atmospheric chemistry at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The negotiations ''appear to be going in the direction of voluntary compliance,'' said Leonard Levin, an air quality specialist with the Electric Power Research Institute, a nonprofit organization with headquarters in Palo Alto, California.
The negotiations in Geneva are being conducted under the auspices of the U.N. Environment Program and are to be followed in the summer by a major conference on mercury in Edinburgh, where scientists and policy makers will discuss how to implement a treaty.
Roughly one-third of the world's mercury air emissions come from human activity, like coal-fired power plants. Another third of emissions come from natural sources, like volcanoes or wildfires, and the final third are ''re-emitted'' after their initial release.
Within the human-generated category, Asia contributes nearly 50 percent of mercury emissions, with North America at 7 percent and Europe and North Africa at 12 percent combined, according to Jerry Lin, a professor of environmental engineering at Lamar University in Texas. In addition to coal-fired power plants, a major source of mercury emissions is small-scale gold mining. Miners working on their own often use mercury to help extract gold and then boil it off, leaving behind dangerous contamination.
The effects of mercury contamination are not limited to the local environment. Mercury finds its way into the sea, affecting fish like bluefin tuna, and airborne emissions can travel between continents.
''The mercury today will continue to circulate in the system for a long time,'' Dr. Selin said. ''We're talking decades to centuries.'' Methyl mercury, the toxic form, even poses a substantial problem for the Arctic, she said, because it can accumulate in polar bears and seals.
Meanwhile, research into the health consequences of mercury ''has been finding adverse effects at lower and lower exposures,'' Philippe Grandjean, chair of environmental medicine at the University of Southern Denmark, said in an e-mail. New research has found that some people may be more sensitive to the effects of mercury, he said, because of factors like genetics.
The European Union has moved aggressively to combat mercury exposure. A ban on mercury exports began in 2011, and the Union has issued rules on storing mercury and restrictions on some products containing mercury, like thermometers. It is currently considering additional rules on mercury in dental fillings and batteries.
Sweden has ''been really out in front'' on national mercury regulations, Dr. Selin said. The country banned mercury from dental fillings and other products several years ago.
Starting in January, the United States will ban the export of elemental mercury, whose uses include gold mining. (The ban covers the Department of Defense and the Department of Energy, which keep large stockpiles.) The new policy results from the Mercury Export Ban Act of 2008, which was introduced by two senators -- including Barack Obama, who represented Illinois at the time -- and was signed into law by President George W. Bush.
In another key mercury development, last year, the Environmental Protection Agency in the United States completed its first rule aimed at mercury emissions from coal plants. The effect on the power industry is unclear, however.
The mercury limits are ''probably achievable for existing plants,'' said Mr. Levin of the Electric Power Research Institute. Additional rules, not yet completed, would cover emissions from new coal plants, and their effect is still being evaluated, he said.
Other regulations in the United States have also affected coal plants. Controls required for pollutants like nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide can also reduce mercury emissions, as a ''co-benefit.''
For China, which is building new coal-fired power plants at a rapid rate, such ''co-benefits'' could prove crucial, said Dr. Lin of Lamar University. That is because it would be economically difficult to control only for mercury.

HEADLINE: New Presumptions About Who's Rich in China

BYLINE: By DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Outside Honesty Dog House, a cold and dry December wind whipped coils of beige earth skyward. We ran for the brick buildings.
Dozens of dogs surged and barked in a central courtyard of the kennel in Tongzhou, east of Beijing: golden retrievers, Labradors and Tibetan mastiffs, elegant breeds aimed at China's fast-growing upper and middle classes.
Fulfilling a longtime promise to our children, we, too, had come to buy a dog. I had tried to explain to Mr. Yang, the owner, over the phone what we were looking for, so he took us straight to a dim room heated by a coal brazier that echoed with the barking of a dozen pit bull puppies and bulldogs. I grabbed my 4-year-old daughter and drew her to me. My son and husband stared. 
''That's what you said, isn't it?'' asked Mr. Yang, sensing our consternation.
''Uh, no,'' I said, as my husband showed him photographs of a boxer on his mobile phone.
''Oh. Quanshi gou,'' said Mr. Yang, a sunburned, wiry man in his 40s. ''Actually we're not that precise in Chinese about what to call them. There's also yingshi niugou,'' or English bulldog, he said, pointing. ''Or French ones. Do you want one of those?''
Then one of those magical moments happened and our gaze was drawn, as if by command, to a cage on the floor, where a single, brown boxer puppy stood on his hind legs, paddling at the sides, staring at us hopefully.
It was Hercules -- or Xiao Tongzhi, ''Little Comrade,'' as I now call him, to the equal shock and delight of Chinese friends who sense a breached taboo in giving an animal a revolutionary name. (Today, ''comrade'' also means homosexual, so the reaction is complex.)
We wanted him. But it was close.
''Fifteen thousand renminbi,'' said Mr. Yang -- $2,400. The boxer is not an indigenous breed, but that was too much for an ordinary family. (In the United States, they might cost around $300.) Dreading the children's disappointment, I set to bargaining.
My main card was an honest one: Just because we're foreigners doesn't mean we're rich.
Once, non-Chinese in China were wealthy compared with Chinese, and widely perceived as such. We were charged more for the same things and even had to use a special currency, the F.E.C., or Foreign Exchange Certificate. (It was abolished in 1995.) But over the past three decades, China has seen the creation of enormous wealth.
This year, the Shanghai-based Hurun Rich List counted 251 U.S.-dollar billionaires, compared with two in 2000. There were at least 2.7 million dollar millionaires, according to the list, whose founder, Rupert Hoogewerf, says he believes the true numbers are higher.
And yet there are many poor, too. This week, a survey found that China's Gini coefficient -- a measure of income inequality -- was 0.61 in 2010, with zero equaling perfect equality and 1 equaling a situation where one person owns all the wealth. That was significantly higher than the global average of 0.44 and 50 percent above the ''risk level'' for social unrest, The South China Morning Post, a Hong Kong newspaper, wrote, citing Chinese news media.
The survey, conducted on 8,438 households and 29,500 individuals, was set up by the Finance Research Institute of the People's Bank of China and Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, The Post reported.
For many Chinese today, spending 15,000 renminbi on a puppy is unremarkable, even though it remains impossible for others.
I had to instill some normalcy into the negotiation and disabuse Mr. Yang of the idea that because we were non-Chinese we must be wealthy.
''You know who are the richest people in China today?'' I began, casually. ''Chinese people.''
Mr. Yang nodded in polite agreement.
''Foreigners are merely middle-class,'' I continued. ''The rich are all your own people. They're the ones with money.''
I saw some kind of understanding dawn on him. We set to naming prices.
''This morning, a Chinese man bought one for 11,500 renminbi,'' said Mr. Yang. ''It's the lowest I'll go.''
''Who knows where people get their money from these days,'' I countered.
''I'm not rich either, you know,'' grumbled Mr. Yang. ''I have a child to educate.''
''So do I,'' I parried. ''Two.'' As he inched down, I inched up.
In the end, perhaps sensing a deal was better than no deal, he thrust Little Comrade into my arms, naming a price far below his asking but still above mine.
''Take him,'' he nodded, not unhappily, as if to say: You and I, we're the same. Just trying to get by.
And yet the incident reminded me not just how foreigners in China today are no longer comparatively rich -- something I welcome as it shows that many Chinese people are doing much better -- but that China is no longer cheap, by any standard.
Prices are rising relentlessly as the economy swells, and in a repressed economy with few outlets for investment other than a bubbly property market, rich people are willing to pay exorbitant amounts for things that may prove a good investment.
Even ink-grinding stones, used in traditional painting, have become a speculative object. Pu'er tea long ago became something one can buy and sell for profit rather than drink. As for buying a home, the Nobel Literature laureate Mo Yan said recently that his $1.2 million award would not buy him a decent apartment in central Beijing.
I suppose we were lucky with Little Comrade. Last year, Chinese media reported, a Tibetan mastiff sold to a rich businessman for around $1.5 million.

HEADLINE: Gas Field Off of Cyprus Stokes Tensions With Turkey

BYLINE: By STEPHEN GLAIN

 BODY:
NICOSIA, CYPRUS -- In October, the government of Cyprus announced it was negotiating possible licensing deals with 15 companies to explore for natural gas in a deep-water zone off the island's southwest coast. The government says it expects to sign four contracts early next year -- raising deep concerns over the possible reaction of Turkey, which has never recognized the Republic of Cyprus or its maritime borders since the de facto division of the island in 1974.
''Turkey says it will not tolerate exploration and Cyprus says it will proceed,'' said Hubert Faustmann, an associate professor at the University of Nicosia. ''Neither side has blinked and they're playing for great stakes.''
Aphrodite, as the gas field is named, was discovered a year ago, about 35 kilometers, or 20 miles, west of the Leviathan field, itself discovered a year earlier in Israeli waters. According to an initial survey conducted by Noble Energy, based in Houston, Texas, it could contain 5 trillion to 8 trillion cubic feet of gas, or 142 billion to 227 billion cubic meters, more than Cyprus could consume in a century. 
In the initial discovery euphoria, there were suggestions that the development of the Eastern Mediterranean fields could help to stabilize one of the world's most politically troubled regions.
Political and energy analysts suggested that cooperation between Cyprus and Turkey on gas transportation, and revenue sharing between Greek and Turkish Cypriots, could help to revive stalled Cypriot reunification talks. Gas exports could also help revive a Cyprus economy pummeled by the euro crisis and help Europe to reduce its dependence on Russian-controlled gas. And regional cooperation could help to diminish tensions between Israel and its neighbors.
A year on, the mood has changed. Nicosia, by embarking on a unilateral exploration program, has antagonized both Turkish Cypriots and the Turkish government of Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Ankara, in turn has warned that it would respond forcefully to continued drilling unless the ''inherent and equal rights'' of the Turkish Cypriots to hydrocarbon finds are respected, said Mithat Rende, a senior Turkish foreign ministry official, in an interview last month.
Turkey also claims that portions of the exclusive economic zone established by Nicosia in 2010 as part of its gas exploration program lie within Turkey's continental shelf.
Last month, at an international energy conference in Istanbul, Turkey reiterated warnings that the world's major energy companies would lose access to its vast market should they work with Nicosia on Aphrodite. Companies currently negotiating possible deals with Cyprus include Total of France, Eni of Italy and Novatek of Russia.
In a similarly pointed warning, in May, Turkish fighter jets chased Israeli warplanes from what Ankara said was Turkish airspace just north of Cyprus. The chilling of formerly cordial relations between Turkey and Israel reflects not only the standoff over Israel's blockade of Gaza but also close Israeli cooperation with Nicosia on exploration of Cypriot gas reserves.
According to a report from the International Crisis Group, citing local news reports, tensions are continuing to rise, with Greek Cypriots accusing Turkey of increasingly provocative military maneuvers and ''gunboat diplomacy.''
''We cannot rely on either side of Cyprus to show leadership on this issue,'' says Ozdil Nami, a member of the Turkish Cypriot Parliament and a former chief of negotiations for reunification. ''We need the U.S., Russia and others to take a stance. Otherwise this area will present itself with another conflict in a region where we don't need another one.''
Since it could take at least seven years to deliver Aphrodite gas to market, some observers say interested parties have plenty of time to unravel their thicket of disputes. Most agree, however, that reconciliation over the field is unlikely without progress on Cypriot reunification, the prospects for which are dim.
There are also market forces to consider. As sources of natural gas proliferate, the price may decline even as Europe revives economically. Energy analysts say U.S. shale gas in particular, which now accounts for 35 percent of U.S. natural gas consumption compared with just 1 percent in 2000, is a global game changer.
One obvious way to leverage a price advantage from Aphrodite gas would be to transport it in the most cost-efficient way, which by all accounts means pumping it through a pipeline from Cyprus to Turkey, where it could be shipped to Europe. That would suit the Europeans who, having been denied gas supplies in late 2006 as a consequence of feuding between Russia and Ukraine, identified Turkey as a vital transit point for fuel.
In addition to the cost benefits, some analysts say, a Cyprus-Turkey pipeline would be just the tonic needed to stir reunification talks, or as Laura Le Cornu, an energy consultant based in Cyprus, puts it, ''the mother of all confidence-building measures.''
For many Greek Cypriots, however, to say nothing of Israelis, such faith in Turkish good will is dangerously naïve. Not only has Russia been known to turn off its gas taps to settle geopolitical scores, Egypt in April briefly interrupted Israeli and Jordanian supplies and Turkey has done the same to Greece over the last several years. Given such exigencies, says Andreas Theophanous, a professor at the University of Nicosia, ''Why would you accommodate a country that does not recognize your right to exist?''
That leaves only two alternatives: pumping the gas via pipeline from Greek Cyprus to the Greek island of Crete and then on to Europe, or building a liquefied natural gas terminal and transporting the fuel by sea. Both options are expensive; L.N.G. terminals typically cost about $10 billion, or about 10 times the estimated $1 billion price of a Cyprus-Turkey pipeline.
A pipeline linking Cyprus to Crete would cost even more. Harry Sachinis, chief executive of the publicly controlled Greek firm, Public Gas Corp., which is known by its acronym Depa, says that a study by the pipeline contractor J.P. Kenny has shown the feasibility of such a project: ''If a decision were made today,'' he said, ''it could mean gas to Europe by 2018.''
Still, at some 1,150 kilometers in total pipeline length, a Cyprus-Crete link would be comparable in scale to the Nord Stream system that brings Russian gas to Western Europe under the Baltic Sea and could cost as much as $17 billion to build, according to Strata Insights, a hydrocarbons consulting firm in Nicosia.
Such is the burden of politics, says Praxoula Antoniadou Kyriacou, a former Cypriot gas minister and now a leader of the country's liberal United Democrats party. ''To the extent this problem is unresolved and there is no pipeline through Turkey, that leaves us with more expensive alternatives'' she said. ''We have no choice but to consider political and economic factors.''
Turkey is also running out of options. The strong international response to Nicosia's tender has challenged Ankara on its threat to punish companies that entered the bidding process.
''Cyprus has done a good job of converting licenses into support from big countries,'' said Mr. Haustmann of the University of Nicosia. ''The Turks cannot take on France, Italy, the U.S. -- and Israel.''
Hugh Pope, a director at International Crisis Group, said that ''everyone could win'' if relations were normalized. ''But a failure to strike a political compromise has held Turkey back for decades: Now it's blocking Nicosia's most obvious route back to prosperity.''

HEADLINE: Lebanese Port Drifts Amid Conflicts

BYLINE: By JOSH WOOD

 BODY:
TRIPOLI, LEBANON -- There was a time when this ancient port city still had a future.
To many, the 1960s were Lebanon's golden age. There had been a sectarian conflict in 1958 that had threatened to decay into civil war, but this was generally seen more as a hiccup than as writing on the wall. In the years that followed, the economy boomed, foreign investment flowed in and the country became a familiar destination for the international jet set.
The Lebanese government, looking to build on this image, worked to modernize the young country. In 1963, it commissioned the famous Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer to design a fairground for its second city, Tripoli.
Mr. Niemeyer, who designed much of Brasilia, Brazil's capital, and contributed to the plan for the United Nations headquarters in New York, died last week at the age of 104. 
His futuristic plans for Tripoli's fair called for a large amphitheater, a smaller domed experimental theater, a convention center, a scaled down replica of St. Louis' Gateway Arch, a helipad and more, all set amid gardens and shimmering reflecting pools. The project was to be an iconic anchor for Tripoli's future growth, promoting economic, cultural and artistic development in the city while helping to underpin Lebanon's place on the world stage.
This future never happened.
Construction of the fair was nearly completed by 1975, when the civil war began. Fifteen years later, with 150,000 dead, construction was still unfinished.
Today the fair is abandoned. The inside of the domed experimental theater is dark and reinforcing steel bars hang from the unfinished ceiling.
Without sound tiles in place, the quietest sounds echo repeatedly. Outside, bullet holes blemish its concrete shell. The artificial ponds are empty except when they flood with rainwater. The gardens are kept up, but there are few visitors to the expansive oval-shaped complex. Those who do come are met with questions and suspicion at the gate from the guards. It sometimes takes cajoling and negotiation to gain entry.
In 2006, the World Monument Fund put the fair on its annual watch list of the 100 most endangered sites in need of preservation.
The neglect and decline seen here at the renamed Rashid Karami International Fair mirrors that of Tripoli. Once the seat of Crusader, Mamluke and Ottoman provinces and a major port serving Syria, Tripoli is no longer known for its meandering souks, its commerce or its culture: Modern day Tripoli is known for its widespread poverty, high levels of corruption and repeated bouts of violence.
''I don't understand why Tripoli is like this,'' said Mira Minkara, 33, a tour guide from the city. ''It's a city that has a lot of potential -- if it was developed in the right way it would be a great city.''
While Beirut still had its problems after the civil war, there was at least an effort to rebuild and develop the city. Tripoli, a city of half a million, was left to its own devices, abandoned in the eyes of many.
Today, more than half of its residents live on less than $4 per day, according to data provided by the United Nations' Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia. For the educated, there are few well paying jobs, so most move to Beirut or emigrate.
While it could be said that the wounds of the civil war in Lebanon never truly healed, this is especially true in Tripoli. The conflict in neighboring Syria has deepened Tripoli's divides, resulting in increased fighting between Sunni militias that support Syria's rebels and Alawite coreligionists of the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, who staunchly back the regime.
In the heaviest fighting this year, 17 were killed last week in the latest round of clashes between militias from the Sunni Bab al-Tabbaneh and Alawite Jabal Mohsen neighborhoods.
Tripoli is the hometown of a number of wealthy and powerful Lebanese politicians, including the country's prime minister, Najib Mikati. Increasingly, they have come under criticism for not improving its situation. During the most recent clashes, a photo circulated on social media Web sites of a banner hung in downtown Tripoli by disgruntled residents aimed at the politicians from the city. ''The head of the government, 8 members of Parliament, 5 ministers -- where are you?'' it read.
Some also believe that politicians arm Tripoli's poor and encourage conflict to curry support and loyalty.
''There's not one politician in Tripoli who can say they're not involved in the fighting,'' said Alia Ibrahim, a Tripoli native and correspondent for the Saudi-owned satellite news channel al-Arabiya.
None of the politicians ''invest a penny in this area, they only invest in buying votes,'' said Osei Kabbara, 38, an American-educated Tripoli resident who is looking to leave the country.
The combined effects of the poor security and economic situation are making life in the city difficult.
''Even if there is no war between Jabal Mohsen and Bab al-Tabbaneh, the streets of Tripoli aren't safe anymore,'' said Ghassan, Mr. Kabbara's 44-year-old cousin who works as a consultant for upscale restaurants and cafes. ''I know a lot of people who are trying to move to another place in Lebanon because they cannot take it anymore.''
There are still hopes that the fairground could help revive the city, economically at least. Currently, those in charge of the fair are looking to attract foreign investors to develop the grounds, but instability in Lebanon -- and Tripoli in particular -- has made this difficult.
''This is our problem,'' said Antoine Abou Rida, the current director general of the fairground. ''Every day we have problems in Tripoli, I don't know if somebody will come or not.''
This week, Mr. Abou Rida stayed away from his office at the fair: A cease-fire had been enforced by a heavy Lebanese Army deployment, but the atmosphere remained tense and the city center, which usually escapes the fighting, had been hit by mortars and rockets in the previous days.
Some years ago, a California company pitched the idea of building a theme park in the grounds, but this was withdrawn when Israel and Hezbollah fought a war in 2006. Chinamex, a company owned by the Chinese government, proposed developing the plot, but backed away after the Lebanese Army battled Al Qaeda-linked Fatah al-Islam militants in a Palestinian refugee camp north of the city in 2007.
Occasionally, parts of the fair's convention center are cleaned up and hired out for events, but most of the site's use these days seems to be related to the region's conflicts. One end of the center has been occupied by the U.N. refugee agency to register Syrians fleeing the conflict next door. The United Nations says there are more than 150,000 Syrian refugees in Lebanon. Tens of thousands are in Tripoli alone, compounding the economic difficulties facing the city.
Across the promenade on the other edge of the fair, protesters have set up a small encampment in an unused parking lot. Posters of Brig. Gen. Wissam al-Hassan -- the former head of the police's intelligence branch who was killed in a Beirut car bomb in October -- hang from the tents.
The protesters have been camped out across the street from Mr. Mikati's residence since General Hassan's assassination and are calling for the fall of the government. Many of their tents -- meant for Syrian refugees -- are marked with the logo of the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees.

HEADLINE: OPEC Leaves Oil Production Quotas Where They Are, but Cutbacks Seem Likely

BYLINE: By STANLEY REED and CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries left their 30 million-barrel-per-day quota for oil production intact Wednesday, indicating the cartel's satisfaction with current crude prices and its reluctance to do anything to further weaken the world economy.
But even as it stuck with the status quo, OPEC may face serious tests in the near future, as rising production in the United States and elsewhere threatens the cartel's market share and influence in the world.
So far, though, OPEC has had an easy year. Crude prices have been stable and within the range the organization favors. Although oil prices for U.S.-produced oil have fallen into the range of $80 to $90 a barrel, the price of a global benchmark, Brent crude, remains well above $100 per barrel.
The OPEC basket price, which members consider representative of what they receive for their oil, was $104.80 a barrel on Tuesday. 
''At these prices no one wants to rock the boat,'' said Bhushan Bahree, an OPEC analyst at IHS Cera , who was in the meeting, held in Vienna.
But the global oil market is undergoing significant change, led by the surge in U.S. oil production, which reached 6.5 million barrels a day in September. That was the highest since 1998 and a 900,000 barrels-per-day increase from a year earlier, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
Meanwhile, Iraq, an OPEC member not subject to the organization's quotas because the country is recovering from the ravages of war, is also rapidly increasing production, reaching levels last seen in the late 1990s.
OPEC probably cannot avoid being buffeted by these shifts and their impact on market share.
''More production in the U.S. means there is less available for OPEC,'' said Jamie Webster, an analyst for Washington-based consultants PFCEnergy, who was in Vienna observing the meeting.
Approximately a third of global oil output is produced by the cartel's 12 members: Algeria, Angola, Ecuador, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela.
The high oil prices of recent years have led oil companies to invest heavily in exploration and in techniques to extract hydrocarbons that until recently were off limits, including the shale formations in North Dakota in the United States. As a result, supply is increasing faster than just about anyone expected, while demand remains sluggish as a result of the tepid world economy.
IHS Cera, a market analysis firm, expects the global supply of oil from non-OPEC producers like the United States, Kazakhstan and Brazil to grow by 1.2 million barrels per day next year. That would be well ahead of world demand, which the firm expects to increase by only 800,000 barrels a day in 2013.
Should this prediction, which is in line with the cartel's own forecast, prove to be on the mark, OPEC will probably need to trim its output, giving up market share, to buffer falling prices.
The signs are that -- quota notwithstanding -- it is already cutting back. An OPEC report published Tuesday showed that Saudi Arabia, the key decision maker in the group, had already reduced output by 200,000 barrels a day in November, to 9.5 million barrels per day, its lowest level since October 2011.
''If the world ends up with a lot more capacity to produce oil than appetite to consume it, then either OPEC countries have to figure out a way to cut back production or prices will crash,'' said Michael Levi, an energy fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''Sometimes OPEC doesn't make decisions, but individual countries do and then others follow.''
Abdalla Salem el-Badri, the OPEC secretary general, acknowledged the possibility of production cuts in Vienna on Wednesday. ''Maybe in the coming months we will produce less,'' he said.
Recently, OPEC has not revealed specific quotas for members. But the whole organization was supposed to observe a 30 million barrel-per-day ceiling, which it is now being exceeded by around 1 million barrels per day. This lack of specific targets allows the Saudis to try keeping the global system balanced by adjusting the amount of oil they sell, without the need to haggle over changes.
But if prices look in danger of plummeting, the Saudis would very likely ask their Gulf neighbors and the wider organization to help out, possibly threatening the organization's cohesion.
''It could cause tension in OPEC if they had to cut back substantially to shore up prices; some of the pain might have to be shared,'' said Mr. Bahree of IHS CERA.
At the meeting, OPEC ministers voted to retain Mr. El-Badri, a former Libyan oil official, as secretary general for another year, partly because Iran and Saudi Arabia, longtime rivals for influence in the group, could not agree on a successor.
The rapid growth of Iraqi production may mean OPEC needs to find even larger cuts. Iraq has already surpassed sanction-hampered Iran and become the second-largest producer in the cartel and has plans to go much higher.
The International Energy Organization's central base case forecast for Iraqi production is 4.2 million barrels per day by 2015 and 6.1 million by 2020. That is much less than Iraq's own ambitions but substantially over its current production of roughly 3.1 million barrels per day.
Although OPEC will probably want to bring Iraq back under its quota system, Iraq seems likely to resist. The Iraqi deputy prime minister Hussain Al-Shahristani argued recently that the country needs to make up for the production and revenue it lost for decades under the regime of Saddam Hussein.
Mr. Al-Shahristani said at a conference in London on Dec. 13 that when his country's production reached 4 milllion to 5 million barrels per day, ''we will start discussions with other members of OPEC.'' But if world demand remains sluggish, Iraq's fellow OPEC members may not be patient.
World economic performance is the key. Stronger growth would stoke demand for energy and help soak up substantial increases in supply, as happened when Russia increased its oil production by around 50 percent between 1998 and 2004.
On Wednesday, the International Energy Agency revised its demand forecasts for next year upward by 100,000 barrels per day, giving some comfort to OPEC.
But the I.E.A., an autonomous group that represents oil-consuming nations, wrote that it was trying to interpret a confusing outlook, noting that the European economy is stagnant, while trends for China, the big source of demand growth in recent years, are hard to predict.
''Everywhere, uncertainty prevails,'' the I.E.A. wrote.
Some analysts argue that oil prices are as high as they are today only because of fear of a major disruption, particularly one resulting from the tensions between the United States and Iran over the country's nuclear program.
As OPEC trims output, the spare capacity -- the buffer of oil available to compensate for any outages -- will expand.
IHS CERA forecasts that spare capacity will reach about 3.7 million barrels per day -- most of it held by the Saudis -- in 2013. That is enough oil to deal with all but the most dire events and could calm markets, cooling prices.
''The more spare capacity grows, the less important fear will become,'' said Leonardo Maugeri, a former senior executive of the Italian company Eni, who is now a fellow at Harvard University. Mr. Maugeri said that ''the conditions for a significant downturn'' were in place. But no one is predicting when it will come.
Stanley Reed reported from London and Clifford Krauss from Houston.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: It's a Smart, Smart, Smart World

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
Before I get to the dreary budget debates in Washington, here's a bright spot of good news: We're getting smarter.
My readers are all above average. But if I ever had average readers, they would still be brilliant compared with Americans of a century ago.
The average American in the year 1900 had an I.Q. that by today's standards would measure about 67. Since the traditional definition of mental retardation was an I.Q. of less than 70, that leads to the remarkable conclusion that a majority of Americans a century ago would count today as intellectually disabled. 
The trend of rising intelligence is known as the ''Flynn Effect,'' named for James R. Flynn, the New Zealand scholar who pioneered this area of research. Countless other scholars worldwide have replicated his findings, and it is now accepted science -- although there is still disagreement about its causes and significance.
The average American I.Q. has been rising steadily by 3 points a decade. Spaniards gained 19 points over 28 years, and the Dutch 20 points over 30 years. Kenyan children gained nearly 1 point a year.
Those figures come from a new book by Flynn from Cambridge University Press called ''Are We Getting Smarter?'' It's an uplifting tale, a reminder that human capacity is on the upswing. The implication is that there are potential Einsteins now working as subsistence farmers in Congo or dropping out of high school in Mississippi who, with help, could become actual Einsteins.
The Flynn Effect should upend some of the smugness among those who have historically done well in global I.Q. standings. For example, while there is still a race gap, black Americans are catching up -- and now do significantly better than white Americans of the ''greatest generation'' did in the 1940s.
Another problem for racists: The country that tops the I.Q. charts isn't America or in Europe. It's Singapore, at 108. (The reason may have to do with Singapore's Confucian respect for learning and its outstanding school system.)
None of this means that people today are born smarter. While I.Q. measures something to do with mental acuity, it's a rubbery and imperfect metric. It's heavily shaped by environment -- potential is diminished when children suffer from parasites or lead in air pollution. As a result, the removal of lead from gasoline may have added 6 points to the I.Q. of American children, according to Dr. Philip Landrigan, a pediatrician and epidemiologist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine.
Flynn argues that I.Q. is rising because in industrialized societies we give our brains a constant mental workout that builds up what we might call our brain sinews.
''The brains of the best and most experienced London taxi drivers,'' Flynn writes, citing a 2000 study, have ''enlarged hippocampi, which is the brain area used for navigating three-dimensional space.'' In a similar way, he argues, modern life gives our brains greater exercise than when we were mostly living on isolated farms.
It's not that our ancestors were dummies, and I confess to doubts about the Flynn Effect when I contemplate the slide from Shakespeare to ''Fifty Shades of Grey.'' Likewise, politics does not seem to benefit: One academic study found a deterioration in the caliber of discussions of economics in presidential debates from 1960 to 2008.
But Flynn argues that modern TV shows and other entertainment can be cognitively demanding, and video games like those of the Grand Theft Auto series probably require more thought than solitaire. (No, don't call the police. My teenage kids are not holding me hostage and forcing me to write this paragraph.)
Back to the debates in Washington. To me, the lesson from this research is the vast amount of human potential globally that is available if we can nurture and stimulate kids who now get neglected.
One challenge is to preserve foreign aid. Some 61 million children around the world still don't attend even primary school, and President Obama in his 2008 campaign was right to propose a global education fund, in part as an alternative to extremist religious schools. I'm hoping the idea doesn't get dropped forever.
The even greater challenge is nation-building at home at a time when funding for schools is being slashed, about 7,000 high school students drop out every day, and there are long waits to get into early-childhood-enrichment programs like Head Start. Literacy programs can help break cycles of poverty and unleash America's potential -- and a single F-35 fighter could pay for more than four years of the Reading Is Fundamental program in the entire United States.
As we make hard budget choices, let's remember that the essential fact of the world is that talent is universal and opportunity is not. I hope we're finally smart enough to try to remedy that.

HEADLINE: Russell Libby, Organic Farming Advocate, Dies at 56

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
Russell Libby, one of the nation's leading advocates for organic farming, died on Sunday at his farm in Mount Vernon, Me. He was 56.
The cause was cancer, his wife, Mary Anne, said.
What began with his fourth-grade teacher handing out packets of vegetable seeds to her students in Sorrento, Me., nearly five decades ago, evolved into a lifelong passion for Mr. Libby and a deep concern about industrial farming and its use of chemical fertilizers and pesticides.
''We have to challenge the idea that contamination is just the price of living in the modern world,'' was a refrain in his many speeches. 
For 17 years, until he stepped down last month, Mr. Libby was executive director of the Maine Organic Farmers and Gardeners Association, which he had built into one of the largest of the organic movement's state organizations.
Since Mr. Libby was named director in 1995, membership doubled, to more than 7,000, and the number of organic farmers and producers in the state increased to 420, from 85.
Under Mr. Libby, the organization moved from a single office in Augusta, Me., to a 400-acre complex of offices, exhibition halls, a library, a teaching kitchen and farmland in the town of Unity. The association distributes educational material throughout the country, places apprentices on farms in Maine and provides advice to local farmers on financing, marketing and food safety, as well as agricultural techniques.
Mr. Libby also held sway with public officials, playing a central role in lobbying Congress to amend the Food Safety Modernization Act of 2011 to protect organic farmers. The act vastly broadened the power of the Food and Drug Administration to regulate food production.
''The original legislation would have made it extremely difficult for small farmers to comply with the requirements,'' said Fred Kirschenmann, a fellow at the Leopold Center for Sustainable Agriculture at Iowa State University, adding that some requirements ''really had nothing to do with the safety of food.''
In a statement, Kathleen A. Merrigan, the deputy secretary of the Department of Agriculture, called Mr. Libby ''a powerful voice for and leader of small family farmers.''
Russell Wayne Libby did not grow up on a farm; he planted those seeds from his teacher in the backyard. Born on Aug. 16, 1956, in Lincoln, Me. (the family later moved to Sorrento), he was the oldest of four children of Ronald and Sandra Libby. His father was a detective with the state police.
After graduating from Bowdoin College in 1978, Mr. Libby went on to earn a master's degree in agricultural economics from the University of Maine. He became a researcher for the National Center for Economic Alternatives, a small nonprofit organization, and later for the Maine Department of Agriculture.
Besides his wife and parents, Mr. Libby is survived by three daughters, Anna, Margaret and Rosa; a brother, Chris; and two sisters, Pamela Fowley and Ronda Nichols. Beyond organic farming's environmental and health benefits, Mr. Libby saw its value to local economies. In many speeches, he espoused a ''Ten Dollars a Week'' concept: the idea that communities could thrive if every household spent that amount on locally produced food, rather than buying from supermarket chains.
On his 65-acre Three Sisters Farm in Mount Vernon, he and his daughters tended to the apple, pear and cherry trees, and to sheep, hens and a pony. They sold eggs to people around town.

HEADLINE: Investors Stay Calm, If Cautious

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
Washington wonders what will happen. Wall Street thinks it already knows.
Politicians remain locked in a rancorous debate over impending tax increases and spending cuts, and it remains unclear if a deal will be reached by the end of the year. But investors are already betting that lawmakers will do enough to avoid heading over the so-called fiscal cliff.
Fears that the divide separating Republicans and Democrats might be too great to bridge helped send markets down in the week after the election. More recently, share prices have climbed steadily, rising for most of the last three weeks to reach their highest point since late October. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended Wednesday flat, up 0.04 percent, to 1,428.48, after briefly spiking after the Federal Reserve's announcement that it was expanding its bond-buying programs to stimulate the economy. The afternoon drop was attributed to the Fed's projection that the economy would grow slightly less than expected next year. The benchmark index is now up almost 14 percent for the year.
''Clearly there is no nervousness in the market at all,'' said David Woo, the head of global interest rate research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ''There is a lot of complacency.''
The current rally has been fueled by the broad consensus among investors that Congress and the White House have narrowed their differences enough to make an agreement inevitable. But these same traders and strategists also are waiting for the first sign that negotiations in Washington are going to derail. In a survey conducted by the Potomac Group, nearly two-thirds of investors said that if an agreement was not reached by Dec. 31, the Dow Jones industrial average was likely to fall at least 10 percent.
Greg Valliere, a researcher at the Potomac Group, is among a loud minority on Wall Street that believes the current confidence is misplaced, given the recent track record of politicians on finding solutions to tough fiscal problems.
''Many people in the markets feel that its unthinkable that Washington would do something this irresponsible,'' said Mr. Valliere. ''After following Washington for 30 years, I would argue it is not unthinkable.''
The debate over taxes and spending is not the only thing that has helped stock prices higher. A growing stream of economic data has pointed to a strengthening recovery in the housing market and an improvement in the employment picture. The Fed also has continued its efforts to support the economy by keeping borrowing costs down and pushing investors into riskier assets.
Still, Wall Street has been fixated on every twist and turn in the negotiations in Washington. A Barclays survey of 400 of its clients found that a significant majority believed that ''mismanagement'' of fiscal policy posed the most significant near-term threat to markets.
The state of the debate in Washington seems to vary by the hour and the politician at the microphone. Speaker John A. Boehner said Wednesday morning that he and President Obama remained ''far apart'' on a possible deal.
Ken Taubes, the chief investment officer at Pioneer Investments, said that despite such rhetoric, he was betting on a last-minute agreement because many Republicans had already conceded that taxes needed to rise and many Democrats, including the president, had said that spending would fall.
A failure to reach a compromise ''just seems like such a low probability event given that everyone knows what has to happen, and how bad the consequences are if it doesn't,'' Mr. Taubes said.
A number of indicators, such as the price of military contractors' stocks, suggest that Mr. Taubes's view is widely shared. The Department of Defense is to have its budget slashed next year if there is no resolution to the negotiations. But since the election, shares of military contractors are actually doing better than the broader market.
Others can recall recent episodes where the confidence that Wall Street had placed in politicians proved to be misplaced. In the summer of 2011, investors knew for months that the United States was approaching its legally mandated debt ceiling, but it was only a week before the deadline that stocks started to plunge. The sharpest drop came when Standard & Poor's lowered the country's credit rating, after a last-minute agreement was reached. Those losses were ultimately recovered.
Leon LaBrecque, the founder of the asset manager LJPR, said he has already prepared for a breakdown of the talks in Washington by scaling back his stock holdings by 25 percent. He said he would start buying after an agreement was reached.
''We're in cliff mode right now,'' said Mr. LaBrecque.
There are several possible outcomes. The president and Congressional leaders have expressed their desire for a sweeping agreement that creates certainty on the budget for the coming years. Most on Wall Street discount that possibility, and expect what Garth Friesen of the hedge fund III Associates calls ''a patch with a promise.'' This would involve a short-term agreement that pushed broader negotiations into next year.
Mr. Friesen said his firm assumed the chances of that happening at 80 percent. If it looks like even a temporary solution is eluding politicians, Mr. Friesen said he had contingency plans for the markets turning sour.
A number of analysts have said that an agreement that delays difficult decisions could still affect the markets, particularly if it leads another credit rating agency to lower its rating of the United States.
If there is a quicker agreement, it could give stocks at least a temporary bounce. But Mr. Valliere and other Washington analysts are already looking to the next opportunity for gridlock, the debt ceiling the country is expected to hit early next year.
''You could argue that a debt ceiling default scenario could be even more worrisome for the markets later in the winter,'' said Mr. Valliere.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed Wednesday down 2.99 points, or 0.02 percent, at 13,245.45. The Nasdaq composite index fell 8.49 points, or 0.28 percent, to 3,013.81.
Interest rates were higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 13/32 to 99 10/32 and the yield rose to 1.70 percent from 1.66 percent late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Census Officials, Citing Increasing Diversity, Say U.S. Will Be a 'Plurality Nation'

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
The term ''minority,'' at least as used to describe racial and ethnic groups in the United States, may need to be retired or rethought soon: by the end of this decade, according to Census Bureau projections released Wednesday, no single racial or ethnic group will constitute a majority of children under 18. And in about three decades, no single group will constitute a majority of the country as a whole.
As the United States grows more diverse, the Census Bureau reported, it is becoming a ''plurality nation.'' 
''The next half century marks key points in continuing trends -- the U.S. will become a plurality nation, where the non-Hispanic white population remains the largest single group, but no group is in the majority,'' the bureau's acting director, Thomas L. Mesenbourg, said in a statement.
The new projections -- the first set based on the 2010 Census -- paint a picture of a nation whose post-recession population is growing more slowly than anticipated, where the elderly are expected to make up a growing share of the populace, and that is rapidly becoming more racially and ethnically diverse. All of these trends promise to shape the nation's politics, economics and culture in the decades to come.
The nation's total population is not expected to hit 400 million until 2051, which is 12 years later than the bureau previously projected, said Jennifer Ortman, a demographer with the Census Bureau. The prediction that the nation's population will grow more slowly reflects the bureau's projections that there will be fewer births and fewer immigrants coming to the United States, based on recent trends.
Caring for an aging population, and paying for it, will continue to pose challenges. By 2060 one in five people in the United States will be 65 or older, the Census projects, up from one in seven now. The share of the population that is between 18 and 64 -- considered working age -- is expected to decline to 56.9 percent in 2060 from 62.7 percent now. In 2056, there are projected to be more people 65 and over than under 18 for the first time.
The diversity of the nation's children is increasing even faster than was previously expected, said William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. ''When the 2020 Census comes around, we're going to have a majority-minority child population,'' he said in an interview.
The Census Bureau expects that moment to come in 2018, several years earlier than it previously predicted. The bureau predicts that by 2043 -- which is a year later than it previously projected -- there will be no single majority group in the country as a whole, as the share of non-Hispanic whites falls below 50 percent.
The population of non-Hispanic whites is expected to shrink both as a share of the population and in raw numbers, the bureau predicted: it is projected to peak in 2024 at 199.6 million, and then to fall by nearly 20.6 million through 2060.
The Hispanic population is expected to more than double during that time, to 128.8 million in 2060 from 53.3 million now. In 2060 nearly one in three residents will be Hispanic, up from about one in six now. (People who identify themselves as Hispanic may be any race.) The black population is expected to increase to 61.8 million from 41.2 million over the same period, with its share of the population rising slightly. And the Asian population is expected to double, to 34.4 million in 2060 from 15.9 million now, with its share of the population climbing to 8.1 percent from 5.1 percent.

HEADLINE: To Bernanke, 'Cliff' Says It All

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN JR.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, said on Wednesday that the economy was already suffering because of the uncertainty over whether Congress and the White House can resolve their standoff over fiscal policy by the end of the year. 
Consumer and business confidence, spending and investment, and hiring are all softer today than they would be without the looming deadline and the continual pronouncements of impasse, he said.
As the inventor of the shorthand term "fiscal cliff" - which implies that the economy would suffer serious harm if large, automatic cuts in federal spending and increases in taxes are abruptly imposed on Jan. 1 because no compromise was found - Mr. Bernanke made plain at a news conference that he believed the most dire warnings were valid.
"If fiscal policy becomes very contractionary," he said, "I think the economy will go off the cliff."
In Keynesian terms, a contractionary fiscal policy would be one in which taxes are increased and spending is cut, sucking money out of the hands of consumers and cutting demand for goods and services.
Absent an agreement before the end of the year, that is just what would happen when tax increases and spending cuts are programmed by law to take effect, cutting the deficit by hundreds of billions of dollars a year. Most economists think a recession would result, and Mr. Bernanke plainly agrees.
Mr. Bernanke dismissed the arguments coming from some quarters that it would do little harm to go past the deadline for a few weeks or months, too short a time for the economic consequences to be profound. "I don't buy the idea," he said. "It would be costly."
And the Fed, which has been struggling to prop up the economy by buying bonds and keeping interest rates low, would be largely powerless to do more in the face of a recessionary policy on taxes and spending.
"We cannot offset the full impact of the fiscal cliff," he said of the Fed. "It's just too big."
He said it would be "most helpful" for Congress and the administration to resolve the fiscal questions on two fronts: first, to not create what he called "enormous headwinds" to the economy in the short term, and second, to build a framework for a longer-term sustainable fiscal path.
Essentially, do not try to balance the books too fast, or when the economy is too weak, but do enough to give the markets and the public some reason to hope that in the long term the fiscal problems can be solved - including changes to address the growing costs of health and retirement programs.
He said he remained hopeful that Congress and the administration would "do the right thing," but he did not offer a detailed prescription, in keeping within the traditional role of the Federal Reserve chairman.
"There is a problem with kicking the can down the road," he said. It risks "derailing the recovery which is currently in process."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Rising Temperatures Threaten Fundamental Change for Ski Slopes

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE; Jack Healy contributed reporting from Denver.

 BODY:
NEWBURY, N.H. -- Helena Williams had a great day of skiing here at Mount Sunapee shortly after the resort opened at the end of November, but when she came back the next day, the temperatures had warmed and turned patches of the trails from white to brown.
''It's worrisome for the start of the season,'' said Ms. Williams, 18, a member of the ski team at nearby Colby-Sawyer College. ''The winter is obviously having issues deciding whether it wants to be cold or warm.''
Her angst is well founded. Memories linger of last winter, when meager snowfall and unseasonably warm weather kept many skiers off the slopes. It was the fourth-warmest winter on record since 1896, forcing half the nation's ski areas to open late and almost half to close early.
Whether this winter turns out to be warm or cold, scientists say that climate change means the long-term outlook for skiers everywhere is bleak. The threat of global warming hangs over almost every resort, from Sugarloaf in Maine to Squaw Valley in California. As temperatures rise, analysts predict that scores of the nation's ski centers, especially those at lower elevations and latitudes, will eventually vanish. 
Under certain warming forecasts, more than half of the 103 ski resorts in the Northeast will not be able to maintain a 100-day season by 2039, according to a study to be published next year by Daniel Scott, director of the Interdisciplinary Center on Climate Change at the University of Waterloo in Ontario.
By then, no ski area in Connecticut or Massachusetts is likely to be economically viable, Mr. Scott said. Only 7 of 18 resorts in New Hampshire and 8 of 14 in Maine will be. New York's 36 ski areas, most of them in the western part of the state, will have shrunk to 9.
In the Rockies, where early conditions have also been spotty, average winter temperatures are expected to rise as much as 7 degrees by the end of the century. Park City, Utah, could lose all of its snowpack by then. In Aspen, Colo., the snowpack could be confined to the top quarter of the mountain. So far this season, several ski resorts in Colorado have been forced to push back their opening dates.
''We need another six or eight inches to get open,'' said Ross Terry, the assistant general manager of Sunlight Mountain, near Aspen, which has delayed its opening a week, until Friday.
The warming trend ''spells economic devastation for a winter sports industry deeply dependent upon predictable, heavy snowfall,'' said another report, released last week by the Natural Resources Defense Council and Protect Our Winters, an organization founded to spur action against climate change.
Between 2000 and 2010, the report said, the $10.7 billion ski and snowboarding industry, with centers in 38 states and employing 187,000 people directly or indirectly, lost $1.07 billion in revenue when comparing each state's best snowfall years with its worst snowfall years.
Even in the face of such dire long-range predictions, many in the industry remain optimistic. Karl Stone, the marketing director for Ski New Hampshire, a trade group, said that good winters tended to come after bad ones -- the winter of 2010-11 was one of the snowiest in recent memory -- and that a blizzard could balance out a warm spell. The basic dynamic he lives with is unpredictability; some areas that were warm last week have snow this week and vice versa.
''Things can change quickly, thanks to one storm, and that's usually how it works this time of year,'' he said, noting the current on-again, off-again snow pattern.
On a warm day last week, when the thermometer reached 51, Bruce McCloy, director of marketing and sales here at Mount Sunapee, was generally upbeat about the coming season, but he could not ignore the brown slopes outside his office window.
''The real problem with a day like this is that you can't make more snow,'' he said. ''There are only so many days until Christmas, and we need so many days at certain temperatures to get the whole mountain done.''
Even in the Rockies, it is difficult to find enough water to make snow. After last year's dry winter and a parched, sweltering summer, reservoirs are depleted, streams are low, and snowpack levels stand at 41 percent of their historical average.
At Sunlight in Colorado, the creek that supplies the pond that, in turn, provides water for snow guns has slowed to a near-trickle.
''It's a nice day -- for September,'' said Greg Ralph, the marketing director at Monarch Mountain, which depends exclusively on natural snow. Monarch was scheduled to open the day before Thanksgiving but has pushed back that date to Friday.
Mr. Ralph estimated that 250 employees at Monarch have been ''on hold'' as the resort languished in the unseasonable warmth.
Concerns about global warming are intensifying at a time when the industry has seen little growth. While ski seasons have swung between epic and terrible over the last 30 years, the number of ski visits nationally from 1979, when the industry started keeping records, to 2011 has grown at a compounded annual rate of only 0.6 percent. Counting 2012 would put the growth rate closer to zero.
The chief reasons, according to people in the industry, are the aging of baby boomers, long skiing's most active enthusiasts, and the fierce competition for time, whether from Caribbean cruises or computers.
Add something called ''backyard syndrome,'' in which urbanites in easy driving range of a ski resort -- say, Bostonians, who live 90 minutes from Sunapee -- are reluctant to head north unless they see snow at home. Even when live webcams show a resort blanketed in white, Mr. McCloy said, it is hard to move city dwellers to the mountains ''until they're shoveling snow or they're stuck in it.''
In response to these problems, ski areas have developed strategies to lure people to their resorts even if the skiing is marginal. Many have expanded into four-season destinations and offer an array of activities that do not depend on the weather: concerts, yoga, craft fairs, conferences, water parks and spas. Sunapee opened a new adventure park this summer with canopy ziplines, a treetop obstacle course and golf.
The most basic strategy for coping with a lack of snow is to make it, and as of the 2009-10 season, 88 percent of resorts belonging to the National Ski Areas Association were doing so. Improvements in snow-making technology have helped resorts compensate for warming trends, and several have invested millions in new energy-efficient tower guns.
''So far, the technology has kept up with climate change,'' said Mr. McCloy at Sunapee, one of those resorts that Mr. Scott in Canada predicted would be put out of business eventually by global warming. ''In fact,'' Mr. McCloy said, ''it's probably improving faster than climate change is happening.''
That may not be the case for long. ''With nighttime minimum temperatures warming at a faster rate than daytime maximum temperatures,'' the Natural Resources Defense Council report said, ''it is uncertain as to what extent snow-making will last as an adaptation strategy.''

HEADLINE: City May Test Smartphone Apps in Taxi Hails

BYLINE: By MATT FLEGENHEIMER

 BODY:
With some board members still skeptical about authorizing smartphone apps to hail yellow cabs, the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission's chairman said Wednesday that the panel was instead likely to consider a pilot program to allow the products for a trial period.
The commission had been expected to vote Thursday on a proposal permitting New Yorkers to request a yellow taxi ride on their smartphones and allowing drivers to receive requests and confirm pickup locations, negating the need for passengers to raise arms toward oncoming traffic. 
David S. Yassky, the commission chairman, said it was now probable that a vote would be held instead on a pilot program with similar features.
''Bringing apps into New York would be a change in the way people get taxis,'' Mr. Yassky said in an interview. ''It makes sense to see how that pans out and see if any of the supposed problems with that materialize before you make it permanent.''
He said the commission had also discussed limiting an app's geographic reach, possibly restricting New Yorkers to hail taxis that are only a short distance away. Officials have reasoned that this provision would temper the number of empty taxis that bypass would-be passengers on their way to an electronically arranged pickup.
In recent days, amid complaints from the for-hire vehicle industry that smartphone apps would jeopardize their business, it became clear that some commissioners, and perhaps a majority, were prepared to vote down any permanent rule change.
''You can't just pull the rug out from them and say: 'Guess what? We're changing the structure,' '' said Nora C. Marino, one of the nine board members.
Opponents of the apps have also contended that they violate the industry's long-standing ban on prearranged rides in yellow taxis. One commissioner, Frank V. Carone, said he still believed that the apps constituted prearrangement, but he now supported a pilot program after initially opposing the rule change.
The tussle over smartphone apps has highlighted tensions facing a city that often trumpets its tech-friendliness but has been criticized by app developers and users for not moving quickly enough to support such services.
In a blog post written after his company ended its brief foray into the New York yellow taxi market in October, Travis Kalanick, the chief executive of Uber, urged customers to try his product ''in more innovation-friendly cities'' like Boston and Toronto.
In a statement on Wednesday, Mr. Kalanick said that he was ''encouraged'' that the city was ''responding quickly to make the system work better'' for drivers, riders and the city's economy.
Mr. Yassky appeared to weigh concerns about the city's image in e-mails to city officials during the summer, noting that allowing electronic hailing was ''the policy choice most consistent with N.Y.C.'s image as a 'tech-forward' place to do business.''
But resistance remains significant in some corners of the industry, particularly among for-hire vehicle operators who have long thrived on prearranged rides. The adoption of a pilot program is unlikely to assuage their concerns. Several members of the City Council have also written letters to the commission, expressing fears that the apps may lead to an increase in distracted driving or leave those without smartphones at a disadvantage.
Avik Kabessa, the chief executive of Carmel Car and Limousine Service and a member of the Livery Roundtable, a group representing livery drivers and base owners, said the discussion of a pilot program suggested weak support for apps among the commission's board. ''If they had the votes, there wouldn't be a pilot,'' he said. ''A pilot that bypasses a bad rule is a bad pilot.''
Perhaps, he suggested, the commission should also test a program that allows livery cars to perform hails like yellow taxis all over the city.

HEADLINE: Judges Needed for Federal Courts

 BODY:
There has been a severe breakdown in the process for appointing federal judges. At the start of the Reagan years, it took, on average, a month for candidates for appellate and trial courts to go from nomination to confirmation. In the first Obama term, it has taken, on average, more than seven months.
Seventy-seven judgeships, 9 percent of the federal bench (not counting the Supreme Court), are vacant; 19 more seats are expected to open up soon. The lack of judges is more acute if one considers the growing caseload. The Judicial Conference, the courts' policy-making body, has recommended expanding the bench by 88 additional judgeships. 
President Obama must make fully staffing the federal courts an important part of his second-term agenda -- starting with the immediate Senate confirmation of the 18 nominees approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
A significant reason for the slowdown has been the partisan opposition of Republicans to appeals court and even to trial court nominations, even though almost none of the nominees have backgrounds that raise ideological issues. The Republicans have time and again used the filibuster, the threat of filibuster, holds on nominations and other tactics to block confirmations.
The Democratic majority, led by Senator Harry Reid, can speed up the process by limiting use of the filibuster. He can do so by pushing for a simple majority vote at the start of the January session to alter Senate rules so that every judicial and executive-branch nominee is assured an up-or-down vote within 90 days. Without that change, many judicial nominations will founder.
Even if that rule change is made, the process of identifying, vetting and approving judicial candidates will need greater attention. Senators, who by custom recommend to the president candidates for federal trial judgeships in their states, should put in place more effective steps for making timely recommendations (like setting up merit selection committees) and making a choice within a reasonable period, like within 60 days of an opening.
The White House and the Justice Department, meanwhile, need to commit more resources to keeping up with those recommendations, to verify and nominate candidates for confirmation within, say, 60 days of receiving names. And the administration must be similarly prompt in identifying and nominating appeals-court candidates.
In a critically important court like the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, three unfilled vacancies and a fourth expected this winter, out of 11 judgeships, hobble the court's ability to make expeditious rulings in significant cases about regulation of the environment, financial markets and other social and economic matters. Many statutes channel review of such cases to the federal courts in the District of Columbia for their expertise about administrative law and for geographic convenience.
The circuit court is a stark example of the broken appointment process and the harm caused by the Senate's inability to do its job.
Mr. Obama and the Senate should also look to broaden the diversity of the judges they appoint. In his first term, Mr. Obama commendably named a higher share of women (44 percent) and a higher share of minorities (37 percent) than any president before him.
Most of the appointees were already judges, prosecutors or private lawyers, with few public defenders or public-interest lawyers from outside government. Expanding the breadth of experience would help ensure that federal courts have jurists who have some real-life understanding of the myriad issues that come before them.
The Constitution requires the president, with the Senate's advice and consent, to fill federal judgeships. That duty has been terribly neglected and needs to be an absolute priority in the coming year.
The Second Term: This is part of a continuing series on what President Obama and Congress should tackle in the next four years. Other editorials are at nytimes.com/secondterm.

HEADLINE: A Halfway House Built on Exaggerated Claims

BYLINE: By SAM DOLNICK; Sheelagh McNeill contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Seeking an operator for a major halfway house in Brooklyn, the federal government awarded a $29 million contract to a nonprofit group with a promising name, Community First Services, and impressive credentials.
On its Web site and in its bids for contracts, Community First promoted its extensive experience doing work for government agencies, including New York City's Department of Juvenile Justice and the federal Department of Health and Human Services.
Community First hailed the vision of its founder, Jack A. Brown III, whom it portrayed as a veteran of gulf war combat with deep expertise in air-defense artillery. And the group declared that, as its name suggested, it had consulted closely with leading community organizations about setting up the federal halfway house in Brooklyn.
But none of these claims are true, an investigation by The New York Times showed. 
The Brooklyn facility is supposed to be a pillar in an expanding system of federal halfway houses, which are intended to help inmates after they are released from federal prison by arranging for counseling, drug treatment and jobs.
But the contract has instead illustrated how the federal government, like New Jersey and some other states, has faced considerable difficulties regulating these places, even as it entrusts more and more inmates to them.
Today, a year after the contract went into effect, the 161-bed halfway house run by Community First Services has already had three addresses in Brooklyn.
Even though the federal government is paying Community First Services $98 a day for each inmate, one of the three locations was in the basement of a rundown hotel crammed between a junkyard and a homeless shelter. Inmates entering and leaving the building on work-release programs had to run a gantlet of drug dealers on the street.
At its present location, a neighbor has noticed suspicious activity, saying she had twice seen people smuggling packages into the building by lowering ropes from the second floor to the sidewalk.
Inside the halfway house, inmates often have little to do and receive few services, according to interviews with defense lawyers and five inmates.
Some of them pass the time playing cards, ordering takeout food and watching videos, including pornographic ones. At night, they talk on cellphones, which are supposed to be banned; drink alcohol hidden in water bottles; and smoke synthetic marijuana, called K2, the five inmates said.
They also flee. In Community First's first year running the Brooklyn halfway house, the number of escapes nearly doubled, to 27, when compared with the previous year, federal statistics show.
Lawyers and social workers at the Federal Defenders of New York, a nonprofit legal group that provides lawyers to federal inmates, said services were so threadbare that they tried to keep their clients away from the Brooklyn halfway house when possible.
Vivianne Guevara, a senior official at Federal Defenders, said the halfway house was ''a big hindrance'' in integrating inmates back into society.
''I don't think it really promotes healing or rehabilitation,'' she said. ''It's not a supportive environment.''
Mr. Brown, chief executive of Community First, is a politically connected entrepreneur with a checkered history in the halfway-house industry. He used to supervise the Brooklyn halfway house when it was operated by a private company. He set up Community First in 2005 while still working for the company, then used the nonprofit group to bid successfully against the company for the halfway-house contract, according to interviews and public records.
The interviews and records show that over the years, Mr. Brown, 44, has left a trail of exaggerated claims and self-dealing. He was also a key figure in one of the biggest lobbying scandals in Albany in the past decade.
Community First paid Mr. Brown a $241,900 salary in 2010, according to its most recent disclosure records to the Internal Revenue Service. The group also employs his brother and sister.
In an interview, Mr. Brown defended the halfway house, saying it had turned around inmates' lives.
''We're new, but what makes us different, in my opinion, is that we operate understanding that the community is first; I mean, it's in our name,'' Mr. Brown said. ''We always keep in the front of our minds that these clients are eventually going to transition back to some neighborhood within New York City, and we want to make sure that they have the greatest possible chance to succeed.''
He acknowledged that Community First's Web site and its bids for government contracts had contained incorrect claims about the group's and his own accomplishments. He said he had revised the information after being questioned about it by The Times.
Mixed Assessments
The Bureau of Prisons, a division of the Justice Department that oversees federal halfway houses, said it was satisfied with Community First's performance.
The bureau ''conducts proper oversight of this facility, and at this time, we believe that the facility is operating in accordance with its contract requirements,'' said Traci L. Billingsley, a bureau spokeswoman.
Other government agencies, though, have taken a more negative view of Community First Services.
In October, the New York State comptroller rejected a contract for Community First to run a residential program for parolees, accusing the group of ''a disturbing pattern of ethical violations.''
The halfway-house industry has grown rapidly as government agencies seek to cut prison costs and keep inmates from returning to crime.
Federal inmates can be sent to halfway houses when they have a year or less left to serve. The cost of a halfway house spot is generally about two-thirds that of a spot in a prison or jail.
The Bureau of Prisons contracts for about 9,000 beds around the country in more than 180 halfway houses, some of which have over 150 beds. Federal spending on halfway houses exceeded $300 million last year, nearly three times the amount in 2000.
Criminal justice experts praise the halfway-house model. Yet many said the federal government and states had failed to regulate these facilities properly.
In 2010, the Center for Advancing Correctional Excellence at George Mason University, in Virginia, released a sweeping study that concluded that federal halfway houses had no effect on discouraging inmates from returning to crime. The study criticized services as scattershot, at best.
''The feds don't have an expectation of what they want to accomplish,'' said Prof. Faye S. Taxman, the center's director and the lead author of the study. ''These are just places to move people closer to home.''
The jump in federal spending has attracted nonprofit groups that have sometimes found themselves in the middle of controversy.
Dismas Charities, a nonprofit group based in Kentucky that runs roughly two dozen federal halfway-house programs, spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on luxury seats at sports stadiums, according to a report that was issued last year by the state auditor in Kentucky.
Dismas gave up the luxury seats but has retained its public contracts, worth $40 million in 2010. The group, which is the largest federal halfway-house operator, paid its chief executive, Raymond J. Weis, $606,303 in 2010, according to disclosure records.
Nonprofit groups operate most federal halfway houses, but for-profit companies do so as well. The profit-making operators include Geo Group, one of the giants in private corrections, and Community Education Centers, which dominates the state halfway-house system in New Jersey.
The Times published a series of articles in June that focused on escapes, violence and drug use at the Community Education halfway houses in New Jersey.
Some of those problems exist in the federal system as well, The Times found, but federal halfway houses are smaller than those in New Jersey.
Community Education pioneered halfway houses that are as large as prisons, with as many as 1,200 beds. The federal government, though, has not embraced that model. Community Education runs three smaller federal programs in New Jersey and other states.
Community First Moves In
Three years ago, Mr. Brown decided to make it on his own.
He was a vice president at Geo Group, which ran the Brooklyn halfway house. The contract was up for renewal.
Less than a week before bids were due, Mr. Brown abruptly resigned. Geo soon learned that Mr. Brown had set up a nonprofit group without telling his superiors and used it to submit the only bid to compete against Geo, according to the company's claims in subsequent litigation between it and Mr. Brown.
The Bureau of Prisons determined that Mr. Brown's group, Community First Services, had the better proposal and awarded it the contract -- which was worth $11 million over two years, and then $17.5 million if renewed for three more years.
Neither Geo nor Mr. Brown would comment on the litigation.
The suits between Geo and Community First are unresolved, but Mr. Brown's strategy underscored his ambition.
With a youthful face and confident smile, Mr. Brown is at ease with public officials and inmates alike. He has courted politicians, and on Facebook, has posted photos of himself with President Obama at a fund-raising event, as well as with former Gov. David A. Paterson of New York.
In 2003, he testified before the state lobbying commission that his company at the time, Correctional Services Corporation, provided gifts and transportation to lawmakers without disclosing the spending.
No one was charged criminally in the case, but the company was fined $300,000, the largest lobbying penalty issued at the time.
One of the lawmakers in the case was City Councilman Larry B. Seabrook, a Bronx Democrat convicted of corruption this year in a case unrelated to the lobbying. Mr. Brown supervised Mr. Seabrook's brother, Oliver Seabrook, at a halfway house in the borough.
Over the years, both Mr. Brown and Community First have repeatedly overstated their accomplishments, according to an examination of government and other records.
Mr. Brown has portrayed himself as a gulf war veteran who served in the Army, according to his résumé. In 1999, Representative Edolphus Towns, a Brooklyn Democrat, read a statement in Congress praising Mr. Brown for serving four years in the Army's Air Defense Artillery Division.
Neither account was right. Mr. Brown served in the Army Reserves and National Guard, and never abroad, military records show.
Mr. Brown has also said he has a master's degree in ''community economic development,'' which is not the case.
Some of these claims were included in an application that Community First submitted this year to open a charter school in New York. Mr. Brown has no background in education. The group withdrew the application after The Times asked Mr. Brown about it.
Scott Levenson, a spokesman for Mr. Brown, blamed others for the inaccuracies.
''Any instance where factual information about Mr. Brown's biography was made in error was done so inadvertently and without his knowledge,'' Mr. Levenson said.
But he acknowledged that Mr. Brown understood that information submitted on behalf of Community First ''is ultimately his responsibility and has since instituted additional layers of oversight.''
Until recently, Community First's Web site announced that the group was ''currently funded by or developing projects with'' seven government agencies. It also said it had several partnerships with major nonprofit groups.
Nearly all the government agencies and nonprofit groups said they had never heard of Community First.
''I don't know why they would list us,'' said Jannette Rondo, a spokeswoman for the State Office of Alcoholism and Substance Abuse Services.
Mr. Brown acknowledged that the Web site was ''a little bit misleading.''
''They were all agencies we had hoped to do business with at some point,'' he said.
In its bid for the federal halfway-house contract, Community First said it had a $2.2 million contract with New York City to provide shelter for homeless people with H.I.V.
But Community First has never held a city contract, according to the city comptroller's office.
Mr. Brown said in the interview that Community Service had done business with one city agency informally, at a Harlem building where it provides temporary housing for homeless people.
He described the claim of having a city contract as ''miswriting.''
The Bureau of Prisons would not comment on information in the group's bid for the federal contract. Providing specific information about its selection ''would violate the integrity of the procurement process,'' said Ms. Billingsley, the agency spokeswoman.
Job Assistance Questioned
Mr. Brown often distinguishes Community First from private companies by emphasizing that he forges ties to local groups when setting up halfway houses.
''So many times, programs go up, businesses go up and the last people to know it are the neighborhood residents, and that's not fair,'' he said in the interview.
In September, Community First moved the 161-bed halfway house to a new location, on Gold Street in the Dumbo section of Brooklyn. Several prominent neighborhood groups first learned about it a month later, when called by The Times.
''Didn't know a thing about it,'' said Robert Perris, the district manager of Community Board 2. ''I love it when I find out about stealth social service agencies from the media.''
The lengthy federal contract requires Community First to take numerous steps to help inmates find jobs. They are to be assisted with ''portfolio development, résumé writing, proper dress and interview techniques training.'' The halfway house must provide ''individual and group counseling, case management and post-release follow-up.''
But current and former inmates said that in reality, the halfway house provided little more than three meals and a bed.
''They don't set you up with any interviews,'' a current inmate said. ''They put a poster on the wall. They just send you to a job fair. They don't give you any tools.''
Current inmates spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying they feared retaliation for criticizing Community First.
Mr. Brown said such complaints represented the views of a fraction of those who had gone through the halfway house. He said the halfway house had arranged hundreds of jobs for inmates, offering the names of seven employers that had hired them.
But when called, the employers said they had hired far fewer inmates. Most said they had hired one or two.

HEADLINE: A Vital Disability Benefit for Children

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Profiting From a Child's Illiteracy'' (column, Dec. 9):
Nicholas D. Kristof reports anecdotal information about parents in eastern Kentucky who fear that their children will lose childhood disability benefits under Supplemental Security Income if they learn to read. From this he leaps to the conclusion that the program is deeply flawed and must be cut.
The process for getting S.S.I. is onerous. Medical professionals must submit evidence of an impairment that results in ''marked and severe functional limitations.'' The majority of applications are denied. Illiteracy on its own is not sufficient to qualify, and doing well in school doesn't mean a child will lose benefits. 
If some parents are doing what Mr. Kristof reported, that is unacceptable. But the real villain is the lack of job opportunities that results in deep poverty. It's no accident that Mr. Kristof's report comes from the heart of Appalachia. Breathitt County has a median income a little more than half that of Kentucky as a whole and unemployment and poverty more than 50 percent higher than the levels for the state.
S.S.I. is only for people with proven, severe disabilities, but it is also (with food stamps) the only source of income for thousands of families in eastern Kentucky, including families with two parents and no prospect at all of finding a job. We need to end child poverty. Slashing a program that is making a difference for disabled children will only make matters worse.
PETER EDELMAN Washington, Dec. 10, 2012
The writer, a former health official in the Clinton administration, is a law professor at Georgetown.
To the Editor:
Nicholas D. Kristof writes, ''Almost any time the question is poverty, the answer is children.'' In reality, a child's success is largely influenced by the education level of his parents.
According to the National Center for Education Statistics, children of parents who do not finish high school face more challenges than children whose parents hold high school diplomas.
Educated parents are more likely to engage in early childhood education activities with their children, read to them and assist them with their homework. A mother's level of reading skill is unequivocally the greatest determinant of her child's academic success.
So while investing in early childhood education is critical, it cannot be done in isolation from investing in parents, who are the primary influence on and motivator of their children. Adult literacy and basic education programs are crucial to alleviating poverty -- for everyone.
KEVIN MORGAN Interim President and Chief Executive ProLiteracy Syracuse, Dec. 11, 2012
To the Editor:
I take issue with Nicholas D. Kristof's column.
Poverty is the single greatest threat to children's well-being. It is a contributing factor to toxic stress, which has been shown to disrupt the developing brains of infants and children and influence behavioral, educational, economic and health outcomes across the life span.
While the number of children living in poverty has grown to 16.1 million, the proportion of children receiving Supplemental Security Income has remained constant, at about 7.5 percent.
The S.S.I. benefit is modest -- families receive just $615 a month, on average -- but serves as a lifeline for low-income families caring for children with severe physical or mental disabilities.
Medical costs associated with raising a child with disabilities can be staggering, often preventing caregivers from having gainful employment. S.S.I. helps replace lost parental income, blunt the otherwise crushing expense of out-of-pocket disability-related health care costs, and provide vulnerable children with a stable home environment.
What Mr. Kristof terms ''fuzzier intellectual disabilities'' are in fact mental disorders like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or autism. Their diagnosis is possible because of a markedly improved understanding of children's mental health, not the exploitation of the program best suited to care for children with these and other conditions.
JAMES M. PERRIN Boston, Dec. 10, 2012
The writer is president-elect of the American Academy of Pediatrics.
To the Editor:
The story Nicholas D. Kristof tells of parents in rural Kentucky discouraging their children from obtaining an education to enhance the child's chances of getting on Supplemental Security Income at 18 is disheartening. But what is not mentioned is a fundamental program flaw that contributes to dependency: disability is determined not just based on a medical condition but also on a person's ability to work.
So what happens is that young adults needing financial aid because of economic challenges related to disability and health are forced to say they cannot work, even if they can. This happens at a critical moment, when most youths are starting jobs, even if part time or school work-study.
Disability advocates have been stonewalled for years trying to get this profound work disincentive altered. Someone may need S.S.I.'s financial support, but tying receipt of the benefit to not working is a policy that presents many disabled youth with a no-win decision.

HEADLINE: Solar Panels for Every Home

BYLINE: By DAVID CRANE and ROBERT F. KENNEDY Jr.. 
David Crane is the president of NRG, an energy company. Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. is a senior attorney for the Natural Resources Defense Council and president of Waterkeeper Alliance.

 BODY:
WE don't think much about pitch pine poles until storms like Hurricane Sandy litter our landscape with their splintered corpses and arcing power lines. Crews from as far away as California and Quebec have worked feverishly to repair or replace those poles as utility companies rebuild their distribution systems the way they were before.
Residents of New Jersey and New York have lived through three major storms in the past 16 months, suffering through sustained blackouts, closed roads and schools, long gas lines and disrupted lives, all caused by the destruction of our electric system. When our power industry is unable to perform its most basic mission of supplying safe, affordable and reliable power, we need to ask whether it is really sensible to run the 21st century by using an antiquated and vulnerable system of copper wires and wooden poles. 
Some of our neighbors have taken matters into their own hands, purchasing portable gas-powered generators in order to give themselves varying degrees of ''grid independence.'' But these dirty, noisy and expensive devices have no value outside of a power failure. And they're not much help during a failure if gasoline is impossible to procure.
Having spent our careers in and around the power industry, we believe there is a better way to secure grid independence for our homes and businesses. (Disclosure: Mr. Crane's company, based in Princeton, N.J., generates power from coal, natural gas, and nuclear, wind and solar energy.) Solar photovoltaic technology can significantly reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and our dependence on the grid. Electricity-producing photovoltaic panels installed on houses, on the roofs of warehouses and big box stores and over parking lots can be wired so that they deliver power when the grid fails.
Solar panels have dropped in price by 80 percent in the past five years and can provide electricity at a cost that is at or below the current retail cost of grid power in 20 states, including many of the Northeast states. So why isn't there more of a push for this clean, affordable, safe and inexhaustible source of electricity?
First, the investor-owned utilities that depend on the existing system for their profits have little economic interest in promoting a technology that empowers customers to generate their own power. Second, state regulatory agencies and local governments impose burdensome permitting and siting requirements that unnecessarily raise installation costs. Today, navigating the regulatory red tape constitutes 25 percent to 30 percent of the total cost of solar installation in the United States, according to data from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, and, as such, represents a higher percentage of the overall cost than the solar equipment itself.
In Germany, where sensible federal rules have fast-tracked and streamlined the permit process, the costs are considerably lower. It can take as little as eight days to license and install a solar system on a house in Germany. In the United States, depending on your state, the average ranges from 120 to 180 days. More than one million Germans have installed solar panels on their roofs. Australia also has a streamlined permitting process and has solar panels on 10 percent of its homes. Solar photovoltaic power would give America the potential to challenge the utility monopolies, democratize energy generation and transform millions of homes and small businesses into energy generators. Rational, market-based rules could turn every American into an energy entrepreneur. That transition to renewable power could create millions of domestic jobs and power in this country with American resourcefulness, initiative and entrepreneurial energy while taking a substantial bite out of the nation's emissions of greenhouse gases and other dangerous pollutants.
As we restore crucial infrastructure after the storm, let's build an electricity delivery system that is more resilient, clean, democratic and reliable than the one that Sandy washed away. We can begin by eliminating the regulatory hurdles impeding solar generation and use incentives like the renewable energy tax credit -- which Congress seems poised to eliminate -- to balance the subsidies enjoyed by fossil fuel producers.
And as we rebuild the tens of thousands of houses and commercial buildings damaged and destroyed by the storm, let's incorporate solar power arrays and other clean energy technologies in their designs, and let's allow them to be wired so they still are generating even when the centralized grid system is down.
We have the technology. The economics makes sense. All we need is the political will.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Balks at Plan to Add Airwaves for Mobile Internet and Wi-Fi

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- House Republicans warned the Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday against ''giving away'' scarce airwaves that they said could produce up to $19 billion in proceeds if they were instead auctioned to telecommunications companies for use in mobile broadband networks.
The remarks, which came at a House communications subcommittee hearing, took aim at one of the top priorities of Julius Genachowski, the F.C.C. chairman: to make available more unlicensed airwaves, or spectrum, to open congested mobile broadband networks and to use in Wi-Fi hot spots. 
In September, the F.C.C. proposed freeing 12 to 20 megahertz of spectrum for those unlicensed uses. The unlicensed space on the electromagnetic spectrum would also be used as ''guard bands.'' Those are areas that border segments of airwaves that are used by cellphone companies, broadcasters and other communications entities; their purpose is to limit interference from transmissions on nearby airwaves.
Mr. Genachowski defended the commission's plans. ''Unlicensed spectrum has a powerful record of driving innovation, investment and economic growth -- hundreds of billions of dollars of value creation for our economy and consumers,'' he told the committee on Wednesday.
He pointed to Wi-Fi networks, which operate on unlicensed airwaves on the electromagnetic spectrum, as an example of innovation that has generated ''hundreds of billions in tax revenues'' and made the United States a leader in the use of unlicensed airwaves.
But Representative Greg Walden, an Oregon Republican, who is chairman of the panel, said the law that gave the F.C.C. the ability to conduct ''incentive auctions'' of newly available spectrum required ''maximizing the proceeds from the auction.''
For the F.C.C. to obtain the highest price for the spectrum it sells, it should limit the size of guard bands, Mr. Walden said; he said the six-megahertz minimum size proposed by the F.C.C. was unnecessarily fat.
Up to $7 billion of auction proceeds is earmarked to help build a nationwide public safety communications network for first responders. The spectrum for the auctions is supposed to come from television broadcasters who voluntarily give it up or move their position on the airwaves in exchange for some of the auction proceeds.
''I support the use of unlicensed spectrum to foster innovation'' for relief of congested broadband, Mr. Walden said. ''What I cannot support,'' he added, ''is the unnecessary expansion of unlicensed spectrum in other bands needed for licensed services, especially at the expense of funding for public safety.''
The F.C.C.'s five commissioners, who all testified before the subcommittee on Wednesday, are split 3-2 along party lines over the issue of unlicensed spectrum.
Commissioner Robert M. McDowell, a Republican, said it would be premature for the commission to reserve newly available airwaves for unlicensed use.
Instead, the commission should set aside the ''white spaces'' between broadcast television channels for unlicensed use, he said. White spaces are similar, but smaller, guard bands in the part of the spectrum dedicated to broadcast television that are intended to minimize interference between stations.
''At this early stage in the incentive auction process,'' Mr. McDowell said, ''it is not apparent that we should stop the progress well under way in the TV white spaces arena to create a solution for a problem -- an alleged shortage of unlicensed spectrum in lower spectrum bands -- that may never exist.''
The F.C.C.'s plans for unlicensed spectrum received support from Democrats on the subcommittee, including Representative Henry A. Waxman of California. Mr. Waxman said the way unlicensed spectrum would be set aside and used were settled in negotiations on the Public Safety and Spectrum Act, which was enacted this year.
''I am troubled by attempts by some to relitigate issues that were resolved earlier this year, when the bill passed Congress with widespread support,'' Mr. Waxman said.
Republicans on the subcommittee also sparred with Mr. Genachowski over whether the F.C.C. should limit the amount of spectrum any one company could own. That would limit the potential buyers of some spectrum to be auctioned. Supporters of restrictions say they are one of a few ways to give smaller cellphone companies the ability to build nationwide networks.
Separately, the F.C.C. said late Wednesday that it had agreed to allow Dish, the satellite television company, to use spectrum that it controled for mobile broadband; previously, the airwaves were to be used only for satellite transmissions. The change, which was expected, greatly expands the value of the spectrum and could allow Dish to enter a mobile broadband partnership with another wireless company.

HEADLINE: Latino Leaders Warn Congress on Immigration

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - The nation's largest Latino organizations warned Congress on Wednesday that they will keep a report card during the immigration debate next year, with plans to mobilize their voters against lawmakers who do not support a comprehensive immigration bill.
At a news conference here, seven Latino groups and one labor union were showing their muscle, after the record turnout of Hispanic voters in the November elections played a pivotal role in President Obama's re-election victory. 
Janet Murguía, the president of N.C.L.R., also known as the National Council of La Raza, said the election had been a "game-changer" that conclusively "made the political case for a bipartisan solution" on immigration.
"We have worked to build our power and now we intend to use it," Ms. Murguía said. "The bottom line," she said, "is that Latino voters went to the polls with the economy on their minds but with immigration reform in their hearts."
The leaders made it clear they expect quick action in 2013. They said the president and Congress should take up an immigration bill soon after Mr. Obama's inauguration in January, with an eye toward completing passage of legislation by August.
The leaders said they would continue a joint campaign they led this year to naturalize Latino immigrants and to register and mobilize Latino voters. They said they would send results from the report card to those voters, to galvanize them during the debate and to guide their choices in the midterm elections in 2014.
"Make no mistake, we will be watching," said Eliseo Medina, international secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union, which led one of the most extensive Latino voter drives. The report card will show "who stood with us and who stood against us" on immigration reform, Mr. Medina said.
Mr. Obama has said he intends to move quickly on immigration next year, after Congress comes to some resolution on the year-end fiscal crisis and other budget issues. A host of Republicans have come forward since the election to say their party should take a new course on immigration, after Mitt Romney drew only 27 percent of the Latino vote.
Republican leaders who have studied voting statistics are concerned that their party's chances to regain the White House will dwindle if they cannot attract more Latinos. According to the Pew Hispanic Center, Latinos will account for as much as 40 percent of the growth in the numbers of eligible voters in the country between now and 2030. By that year, the center predicts, 40 million Hispanics will be eligible to vote, nearly double the 23 million eligible today.
The leaders said Latinos were spurred to the polls by the hard-line positions that Mr. Romney and other Republicans took on immigration.
"We realized that people were attacking us personally," said Maria Teresa Kumar, president of Voto Latino, a voter mobilization group. The Latino groups will focus on lawmakers in states and districts where their voters can make a difference. For those who do not support reform, Ms. Kumar said, "in 2014 it may not look pretty for them."
Latino leaders argued that Washington has done enough to bolster enforcement against illegal immigration.
"We can no longer see enforcement-only policies moving through Congress," said Chris Espinosa, national advocacy director for the Hispanic Federation. "We have secured our borders, now it's time to get to other elements of immigration reform."
The leaders said they seek a single comprehensive bill, rather than several bills addressing legalization for groups of illegal immigrants, like young people or farmworkers. They said they would insist on a path to citizenship for all 11 million illegal immigrants in the country, rather than a temporary legal status that does not offer an eventual chance to naturalize.
The news conference also included leaders from the League of United Latin American Citizens and the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund.
Mr. Medina, expressing some of the optimistic bravado Latinos are feeling, promised a "massive" grass roots campaign next year. "It's going to be a doozy," he said.
"Failure is not an option," Mr. Medina said. "Comprehensive immigration reform is going to happen. Whether it will be over the political bodies of some of the current members of Congress," he said, "only they can decide."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Income Malaise of Middle Class Complicates Democrats' Stance in Talks

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The income stagnation that has hit the middle class in the last decade is complicating the Democrats' position in the fiscal talks, making it more difficult for them to advocate across-the-board tax increases if a deal falls through.
Many Democrats have derided the expiring tax cuts as irresponsible since President George W. Bush signed them a decade ago. Yet the party is united in pushing to make the vast majority of them permanent, even though President Obama could ensure their expiration at year's end with a simple veto. 
That decision reflects concern over the wage and income trends of the last decade, when pay stagnated for middle-class families, net worth declined and economic mobility eroded. Democrats who generally would prefer more tax revenue to help pay the growing cost of Medicare and other programs are instead negotiating with Republicans to find a combination of spending cuts and targeted tax increases for higher incomes.
If the two parties fail to come to a deal by Jan. 1, taxes on the average middle-income family would rise about $2,000 over the next year. That would follow a 12-year period in which median inflation-adjusted income dropped 8.9 percent, from $54,932 in 1999 to $50,054 in 2011.
The income and wealth trends of the last decade also create a longer-term dilemma for the party. By advocating the continuation of most of the Bush-era tax cuts, Democrats might find themselves confronting deeper-than-comfortable cuts to spending programs that aid the poor and middle class down the road.
''The goal is not just to make the tax code more progressive, but also to obtain adequate revenue to finance progressive spending programs,'' said Peter Orszag, a vice chairman at Citigroup and a former White House budget director. ''Making the tax code more progressive but locking into a vastly inadequate revenue base is not doing the notion of progressivity overall any favors.''
According to calculations by the independent Tax Policy Center, if Congress did nothing and all tax increases took effect at the end of the year, the hit would be broad but the brunt of it would fall on high-income households. Taxpayers in the bottom quintile of the income distribution would see a $412 bigger tax bill. For the top 0.1 percent, the average increase would be $633,946.
Only a small handful of policy voices on the left are making the case for the tax cuts to fully expire. In part, that is because the economy is still growing slowly, and tax increases have the potential to weaken it. But it is also partly because of structural changes in the economy.
''This is about math and values,'' Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat and the chairman of the Finance Committee, said in an e-mail. ''Our first priority needs to be extending tax cuts for the middle class. At a time when we need to cut our debt and are asking everyone to chip in, we simply can't afford to continue extending all of the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.''
The Congressional Budget Office has found that between 1979 and 2007, the top 1 percent of households saw their inflation-adjusted income grow 275 percent. For the bottom 20 percent, it grew just 18 percent, and federal tax and transfer programs also did less and less to reduce income inequality over that period.
The mounting concentration of wealth is even more dramatic. A recent Economic Policy Institute study found that between 1983 and 2010 about three-quarters of all new wealth accrued to the wealthiest 5 percent of households. Over the same period, the bottom 60 percent actually became poorer.
Such figures are why some Democrats argue that even if the economy were to return to Clinton-era growth rates, its poor and middle class could not stomach a return to Clinton-era tax rates, at least not yet. Moreover, it has led Democrats to expand the ''middle class'' to encompass the vast majority of taxpayers, with families earning as much as $300,000 a year unlikely to see their taxes go up.
''The causes of the massive rise in inequality that we've seen that have caused stagnation for the middle class -- stagnation at best -- for the past 20 or 30 years are not likely to abate,'' said Alan B. Krueger, the chairman of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers. ''If they're caused by globalization and skill-biased technological change, they're likely to continue or accelerate.''
Last week, President Obama visited the Virginia home of Tiffany and Richard Santana, a high school teacher and an employee at a car dealership, to make the case. ''They're keeping it together, they're working hard, they're meeting their responsibilities,'' Mr. Obama said of the Santanas. ''For them to be burdened unnecessarily because Democrats and Republicans aren't coming together to solve those problems gives you a sense of the costs on personal terms.''
Mr. Obama's argument for raising revenue from high-income households and keeping taxes low on middle-income households long predates the recession or his time in the White House. Aides say the position stems in part from his belief that long-term economic changes have rewarded the rich and punished many others.
But limiting tax increases to just a small fraction of households might mean raising too little revenue over the long term to finance the programs that Democrats also fiercely want to preserve -- Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare, education, supports for lower-income working families and infrastructure, among others, some policy experts on the left say.
''It's perfectly reasonable for the White House to begin collecting more revenue from folks who have done by far the best in pretax terms,'' said Jared Bernstein of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a former economist for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ''But ultimately we can't raise the revenue we need only on the top 2 percent.''

HEADLINE: A New Top Editor For Business Day

BYLINE: By CHRISTINE HAUGHNEY

 BODY:
Dean E. Murphy, a reporter and editor with The New York Times for the last 12 years, has been named the next editor of the business section of The Times. The announcement was made on Wednesday afternoon in a memo from Jill Abramson, the executive editor. 
Mr. Murphy, 54, succeeds Larry Ingrassia, who has been the business editor since 2004. While it is unclear what Mr. Ingrassia's new position will be, Ms. Abramson said it would be "a larger role" that would be announced early next year.
Mr. Murphy previously worked at The Los Angeles Times, where he was a foreign correspondent based in Poland and South Africa and reported on the war in the former Yugoslavia. He is a graduate of Northwestern University and has a master's degree in international affairs from Johns Hopkins University.
Since he joined The Times in 2000, Mr. Murphy has reported on politics, worked as a San Francisco correspondent and served as deputy national editor before joining the business section as a deputy editor in 2010. Ms. Abramson credited Mr. Murphy for his handling of several highly regarded articles, including an exposé on the hidden wealth of the family of Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China as well as a series on the digital economy that looked at working conditions in both the United States and in China.
Ms. Abramson described Mr. Murphy as "one of our most accomplished editors, a staunch advocate for reporters and a fine writer himself." She added that "his years of reporting from abroad and from both coasts as well as his role as deputy national editor brought heart and breadth to our already superb business report."

HEADLINE: High Cost Leads Canada to Review Plans to Buy F-35 Fighter Jets

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN and CHRISTOPHER DREW

 BODY:
Canada said Wednesday that it would reconsider plans to buy 65 F-35 fighter jets after an independent audit found that the sophisticated stealth planes would cost substantially more than the government had promised.
The decision was an unusual step back by Stephen Harper, the prime minister, who has been a strident defender of the purchase despite widespread public criticism of the price. Two cabinet ministers said an independent panel would review a variety of options, including a version of Boeing's Super Hornet fighter as well as sticking with the F-35, made by Lockheed Martin.
''We have hit the reset button and are taking the time to do a complete assessment of all available aircraft,'' Rona Ambrose, the public works minister, told reporters in Ottawa. 
The announcement came after the auditor, KPMG, estimated that Canada would spend $45.8 billion to buy and operate the planes over 42 years, the expected life span.
When Peter MacKay, the defense minister, first announced Canada's plan to buy the F-35 in 2010, he said the purchase price was $9 billion, but declined to provide operating cost estimates. The next year during an election campaign, the Conservatives put the total cost over 20 years at $16 billion.
If Canada were to back out of the project, it would be a blow to Lockheed and the Pentagon, which is counting on foreign sales to help reduce the cost of building each of the planes.
The F-35 was conceived as the Chevrolet of the sky, a radar-evading aircraft that could be built relatively cheaply and adapted to the needs of the Air Force, Navy and Marines.
But almost from the start, development of the planes and their sophisticated gear proved far more costly and difficult than anticipated.
The plane is now projected to be the most expensive weapons program in history, with the Pentagon spending $396 billion to buy 2,443 planes by the late 2030s. The United States is counting on 10 allies to buy at least 700 more.
To meet the Pentagon's targets of $79 million to $106 million a plane, depending on the model, Lockheed needs to increase its economies of scale by spreading the costs across as many planes as possible. Canada's hesitancy about the project could add to worries among the allies about the plane's cost.
This year, economically troubled Italy cut its planned F-35 order by 30 percent. Britain and Australia have delayed decisions on how many F-35s to buy. And lawmakers in the Netherlands are also questioning the jet's cost.
The Pentagon and Lockheed have stepped up their efforts to reassure those countries and persuaded two others, Israel and Japan, to sign on.
''You have to wonder when a slip becomes a slide with this program,'' said Richard L. Aboulafia, an analyst with the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va. ''This is not a simple question of a fighter from a new generation all by itself in the market. There is price pressure and there's a growing cost-consciousness among all customers.''
Until recently, the ruling Conservative Party in Canada swiftly rejected any suggestion that the country not buy the F-35s. Two years ago, Mr. Harper said that critics of the acquisition were ''playing politics with the lives of our men and women in uniform.''
But after the office of the Auditor General of Canada released a report in March indicating that the planes would cost much more than the $16 billion the government had indicated, Mr. Harper's aides began edging away from the program and hired KPMG to produce the new cost estimates.
Ms. Ambrose and Mr. MacKay repeatedly used the word ''reset'' on Wednesday and avoided questions about what that step would mean in evaluating alternatives. The ministers and officials, however, did make it clear that no decision had been made to start a formal competition among aircraft manufacturers and acknowledged that it remained possible that Canada would stick with the F-35.
The review, Mr. MacKay said, would ''ensure that a balance is maintained between the military needs and taxpayer interests.''
Canada's concerns about the costs of the F-35s come as American officials worry that the F-35's huge price tag could make it a target for budget cutters in Washington as well. The Pentagon has already slowed the program to fix technical problems and reduce the immediate costs.
Pentagon and Lockheed officials sought on Wednesday to play down the developments in Canada.
Lt. Col. Melinda F. Morgan, a Pentagon spokeswoman, said the KPMG cost estimate for Canada was in line with the Pentagon's current projections for the cost of the planes.
She said that Canada's decision to review its options seemed similar to a high-level review the Pentagon conducted in 2010 when problems were mounting with the planes. Top Pentagon officials determined then that they had no alternative that could provide the same capability.
Lockheed issued a statement noting it had worked with Canada's armed forces for 50 years and looked forward to continuing the relationship.
The KPMG study said that if Canada wanted to stick to the original $9 billion price, it would be able to buy only 55 planes.
Possible alternatives to the F-35 include an updated version of Boeing's F/A-18 Hornet, called the Super Hornet, and several European models. The Royal Canadian Air Force currently flies CF-18s, a version of the Hornet. While some of Canada's jets date back about 30 years, Mr. MacKay said Wednesday that the fleet could be kept operational for at least another decade.
In the past, Mr. MacKay and others have emphasized the need for Canada's next generation of fighters to include the radar-evading stealth technology found on the F-35. But several military analysts in Canada have noted that the country's air force had not been actively involved in first strikes, where stealth would be most crucial. Others have questioned using the single-engine F-35 for patrols in remote Arctic regions, a primary mission for Canada's military.
Separately on Wednesday, the government also reduced its estimate of business that Canadian companies were likely to win from F-35 contracts to $9.8 billion from $12 billion.

HEADLINE: So Asian Kids Are Good at Math. What Does That Mean?

BYLINE: JOYCE LAU


HIGHLIGHT: Another set of global student test results, another round of hand-wringing in America. (And a bit of back-patting in Asia). Yet, the technology companies that changed the world come from the U.S. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG- There were two conflicting reactions to international exam results this week. 
From New York, my colleague Motoko Rich reported that "U.S. students still lag globally in math and science, tests show." Reflecting worries among parents and educators in the United States, she added that "fretting about how American schools compare with those in other countries has become a regular pastime in education circles."
Meanwhile, sitting here on the other side of the world, I got a rather self-congratulatory email from the local education bureau saying "it was glad to learn that Hong Kong students had maintained their outstanding performance" in academics. 
It's not exactly breaking news that kids from rich Asian states are good at math and science. It seems like each time a new student ranking is released, U.S. commentators resort to hand-wringing over America's place in the world, while Asians pat themselves on the back.
On Tuesday, the Institute of Education Sciences, the research arm of the U.S. Department of Education, released two major reports: Trends In International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) and The Progress In International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS).
Here are some results:
Fourth-grade science
1. South Korea
2. Singapore
3. Finland
4. Japan
5. Russia
6. Taiwan
7. United States
8. Czech Republic
9. Hong Kong
10. Hungary
Eighth-grade science
1. Singapore
2. Taiwan
3. South Korea
4. Japan
5. Finland
6. Slovenia
7. Russia
8. Hong Kong
9. Britain
10. United States 
Fourth-grade math
1. Singapore
2. South Korea
3. Hong Kong
4. Taiwan
5. Japan
6. Northern Ireland
7. Belgium (Flemish areas)
8. Finland
9. Russia
10. Netherlands
11. United States
Eighth-grade math
1. South Korea
2. Singapore
3. Taiwan
4. Hong Kong
5. Japan
6. Russia
7. Finland
8. Israel
9. United States
10. Australia
As the child of Asian immigrants, I am not surprised by these results, which I think are greatly influenced by the weight that a particular culture puts on math and science, and the way that children are raised. (My brother and I spent many a beautiful summer's day standing stiffly in the living room, reciting multiplication tables, while our American friends played outside. To this day, I still do math in my head in Cantonese.)
I am, however, taken back by this:
Fourth-grade reading
1. Hong Kong
2. Russia
3. Finland
4. Singapore
5. Northern Ireland
6. United States
7. Denmark
8. Croatia
9. Taiwan
10. Ireland 
Hong Kong is not the most literary - or literate - place I have ever lived. People spend little time reading for pleasure, and our literary scene is tiny compared to those in New York or London. But our kids, allegedly, are the most literate in the world.
Meanwhile, American kids don't do so well on math and science exams. But America is, by far, the world's technological leader. M.I.T., Caltech, Stanford and Harvard top just about every ranking of research universities. (Their only non-U.S. rivals are top British schools like Oxford and Cambridge). The companies that changed the way that the world uses technology - the Apples and Googles - come from Silicon Valley. 
Something doesn't compute. 
One explanation is that student test scores don't correlate very closely with how a country actually excels in particular fields. Singaporean kids might test well, but that does not mean Singapore will create the next Google. Success is determined by factors like migration, government support, and whether a society encourages creativity and risk-taking. America, a nation of immigrants, has long attracted overseas scientists. Its culture of innovation hasn't been replicated anywhere. 
The other explanation is that, while student test scores don't have much bearing on the current economy, they can be used as a weather vane for the future. The kids examined for these studies were, on average, 8 and 12 years old. Their impact will come in 20 years' time. Maybe by then, Korean universities will be doing Ivy-League-level research, and Hong Kong will be a literary center. Maybe.
 How much weight do you give student rankings like these?

HEADLINE: When Should You Compromise?

BYLINE: MICHAEL GONCHAR


HIGHLIGHT: How do you negotiate a satisfactory solution when you strongly disagree with someone? 

 BODY:
 Washington has been fretting for months over the so-called "fiscal cliff," the Jan. 1 deadline when taxes automatically rise and government spending drastically falls. Many worry that if politicians fail to act, the United States could fall back into a recession. President Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner have been negotiating, but so far they have been unable to reach a compromise on how to reduce the budget deficit. 
When should you stand up for what you believe, and when should you compromise?
In "Obama and Boehner Talk Deficits at the White House," Brian Knowlton and Jackie Calmes write: 
With just three weeks left for lawmakers to avert a fiscal crisis, President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner met privately at the White House on Sunday as a top Republican senator suggested that his party should perhaps accede to Mr. Obama's demand to raise the top tax rates so that the attention can shift to making serious cuts in benefit programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
Administration officials would not offer details of the discussion between Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner. But the disclosure of the meeting indicated that private discussions continue in the face of Republican leaders' public statements deploring the lack of progress and the president's refusal so far to specify the sort of deep, long-term reductions in spending for social programs that they insist upon as a condition of their support for raising taxes on high earners.
The White House and Mr. Boehner's office issued identical statements afterward that said "the lines of communication remain open."
 Students: Tell us ...

        
When should you compromise, and when should you stand up for what you believe? Do the same rules apply for politicians?
        
How do you negotiate a satisfactory solution when you strongly disagree with someone? What advice would you give Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner?
        
Do you have faith that Republicans and Democrats will be able to compromise on a solution to avoid the "fiscal cliff"? Why?
        
Before reading this Student Opinion question, had you heard of the "fiscal cliff"? Did you know what it was? What do you think is the best solution to the budget crisis?
        
Some people have questioned whether "fiscal cliff" is the best name for the current budget crisis. Can you think of a better name?
        
When have you compromised?

HEADLINE: UBS Unit Is Said to Be Close to Guilty Plea in Rate-Rigging Scandal

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Under the settlement, a UBS subsidiary in Japan would agree to plead guilty to a criminal charge. The Swiss bank could also face some $1 billion in fines and regulatory sanctions. 

 BODY:
 10:00 p.m. | Updated 
Federal prosecutors are close to securing a guilty plea from a UBS subsidiary at the center of a global investigation into interest rate manipulation, the first big bank to agree to criminal charges in more than a decade.
UBS is in final negotiations with American, British and Swiss authorities to settle accusations that its employees reported false rates, a deal in which the bank's Japanese unit is expected to plead guilty to a criminal charge, according to people briefed on the matter who spoke of private discussions on the condition of anonymity. Along with the rare admission of criminal wrongdoing at the subsidiary, UBS could face about $1 billion in fines and regulatory sanctions, the people said.
The steep penalty, a surprise given the bank's cooperation in the case, would represent the largest fine to date in the rate-rigging investigation. In June, the British bank Barclays agreed to pay $450 million to settle accusations that it influenced crucial benchmarks.
 The settlement with UBS, which is based in Switzerland, could come as soon as Monday, the people briefed on the matter said. These people cautioned that the bank's board had not yet approved the deal and it could still fall apart. 
By pushing for a guilty plea, the Justice Department may be signaling a new aggressive stance.
Authorities have been reluctant to indict big banks, fearful of the potential for job losses and the ripple effect through the broader economy. If a bank pleads guilty to a crime, the case can be tantamount to a death sentence because the institution may lose its charter to operate.
With UBS, federal prosecutors are trying to strike a balance. By levying a charge against the subsidiary, authorities send a powerful message, but stop far short of putting the company out of business.
Prosecutors decided against indicting HSBC over money laundering, concerned over the repercussions to the financial system. Instead, HSBC, the British bank, agreed on Monday to pay a record $1.9 billion in penalties.
On Thursday, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to Eric H. Holder Jr., the attorney general, criticizing the Justice Department for an "inexplicable unwillingness to prosecute and convict those responsible for aiding and abetting drug lords and terrorists," referring in part to the HSBC case. Mr. Grassley called the fine "hardly even a slap on the wrist," given HSBC's profit.
But the UBS case offers authorities a long-awaited moment to criminally punish a big bank. While the public is still simmering over the lack of prosecutions stemming from the financial crisis, the actions against UBS could help damp concerns that the world's largest and most interconnected banks are too big to indict.
The Justice Department's criminal division, which arranged the guilty plea with the Japanese subsidiary, could also strike a nonprosecution agreement with the parent company, the people briefed on the matter said. The deal will force UBS to continue cooperating with the wider rate manipulation case.
In a statement, a UBS spokeswoman said the bank continued "to work closely with various regulatory authorities to resolve issues relating to the setting of certain global benchmark interest rates. As we are in active discussions with these authorities, we cannot comment further." The authorities leading the case - the Justice Department, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Financial Services Authority of Britain and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority - declined to comment.
As the UBS investigation comes to a close, global authorities are fast-tracking several civil and criminal cases in connection to the manipulation of important benchmarks, including the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. Regulators and prosecutors have uncovered evidence that points to a systemic problem with the rate-setting process, which underpins trillions of dollars of financial products like mortgages, student loans and credit cards.
Authorities contend that some bank employees reported false rates to squeeze out extra trading profits and deflect concerns about their health during the financial crisis.
The fallout from the Libor case could be significant. The Royal Bank of Scotland has indicated that it could announce penalties before its next earnings release in a couple of months. Deutsche Bank also has set aside money to cover potential fines. In all, the investigation has ensnared more than a dozen big banks.
The push for criminal charges at UBS caught the bank off guard.
After settling a tax evasion case in 2009, the bank was eager to cooperate with authorities and gain leniency in the Libor case. UBS, for example, reached a conditional immunity deal with the antitrust arm of the Justice Department, which was supposed to protect the bank from criminal prosecution under certain conditions. But the deal did not extend to the Justice Department's criminal division, giving authorities some leeway to take action.
With its reputation and profits on the line, the bank moved to dissuade the criminal division from pursuing charges. Bank officials have been meeting with authorities in Washington in a last-ditch effort to influence the outcome, according to the people briefed on the matter.
Eventually, the bank agreed to the broad contours of a settlement that included a guilty plea by the Japanese subsidiary. The bank is still negotiating the final elements of the deal.
Prosecutors are also expected to charge a former UBS trader who featured prominently in the investigation. On Tuesday, Britain's Serious Fraud Office arrested three men in connection with the Libor case, including Thomas Hayes, a 33-year-old former trader at UBS and Citigroup, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The three men, which also included two people who worked at the British brokerage firm R P Martin, were released on bail the same day.
A lawyer for Mr. Hayes could not be located.
Mr. Hayes is expected to be a central figure in the case against UBS. The UBS settlement is likely to include accusations that Mr. Hayes and other employees colluded with traders at other banks to influence the direction of interest rates, as part of a broader scheme to increase their profits. Some UBS traders have been suspended or fired over the matter.
Mr. Hayes built his reputation as an interest rates trader at UBS. He worked at the Tokyo office of UBS from about 2006 to 2009 before departing for Citigroup. Citigroup fired Mr. Hayes the next year, for approaching a trading desk about influencing the yen-denominated Libor rates, and the bank reported his actions to regulators.
The role of Japanese operations came to the forefront last December when the country's regulator sanctioned both UBS and Citigroup. Local regulators discovered that traders at the banks had tried to manipulate the Tokyo interbank offered rate, or Tibor, a main benchmark for borrowing in Japan.
The efforts to rig the rate were "unjust and malicious, and could undermine the fairness of the markets," the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission of Japan said in a statement when recommending the nonfinancial penalties against UBS.
UBS has a big presence in Japan. The bank has more than 1,100 employees in the country, spread across its major business lines.
The guilty plea could have collateral consequences for the unit. For one, the guilty plea delivers a painful blow to its reputation, securities experts say. Depending on the details of the case, the group could also be subjected to an independent monitor and face some limitations on its business. 
 Charlie Savage and Hiroko Tabuchi contributed reporting.

HEADLINE: Late Credit Card Payments Low and Expected to Stay There

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: The mortgage delinquency rate is improving, but slowly. 

 BODY:
Credit card delinquencies are likely to remain low, even as riskier consumers open more card accounts, according to an annual forecast from TransUnion, a consumer credit reporting company.
Meanwhile, the mortgage delinquency rate is expected to fall to 5.06 percent by the end of next year, from an estimated 5.32 percent at the end of this year. (The delinquency rate is the ratio of borrowers who are at least 60 days past due on their payments. The mortgage delinquency rate peaked at the end of 2009 at 6.89 percent.) 
Mortgage delinquency rates, considered a precursor to foreclosure, will fall in 34 states and the District of Columbia, TransUnion predicted.
While delinquency rates are moving in the right direction, they are dropping slowly and remain well above the historic "normal" rate of roughly 2 percent. The slow pace of improvement seems to be tied to a generally slow foreclosure process for mortgage holders who have been delinquent for a long time, said Steve Chaouki, group vice president in TransUnion's financial services unit. The company's analysis suggests that the delinquency rate would fall to about 2.5 percent -- near normal -- if borrowers who haven't made a mortgage payment in over a year are excluded from the calculation.
The outlook remains good for credit cards, he said. Credit card delinquency rates -- the ratio of borrowers who are at least 90 days behind on one or more cards -- are expected to remain low, even though they may rise to 0.87 percent at the end of next year from 0.83 percent now. That's still remarkably low. From 2000 to 2011, the rate has averaged 1.24 percent in the final three months of the year.
Mr. Chaouki said consumers are taking care to keep their credit cards current even if they are behind on their housing payments, because they have come to rely on cards as a means of liquidity in a slow economy.
Card delinquencies have moved somewhat higher in the last year, in part, he said, because the number of new cards issued has been increasing, and nonprime borrowers make up a larger share of new account holders.
Data from TransUnion shows the share of nonprime cards being issued was 29.55 percent in the second quarter of this year, compared with 23.86 percent two years earlier.
The average credit card debt per borrower is expected to rise in the next year to $5,446 at the end of 2013 from $4,996 currently. That would be the highest credit card debt level since early 2009, when average debt per borrower was $5,776.
How are you handling credit card and mortgage debt these days?

HEADLINE: General Motors Refreshes Its Top-Selling Trucks

BYLINE: PAUL STENQUIST


HIGHLIGHT: The big changes are under the hood, where three significantly revised EcoTec3 engines - a 4.3-liter V-6, a 5.3-liter V-8 and a 6.2-liter V-8 - are offered. 

 BODY:
PONTIAC, Mich. - General Motors introduced on Thursday revised 2014 versions of its bread-and-butter half-ton pickup trucks, the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500.
At a glance, the trucks closely resemble the vehicles they are replacing. But both front and rear wheel well arches are more defined than those of the older models, subtly suggesting classic stepside pickup styling. Other visual changes include full bumpers, hood sculpturing, restyled headlights and relocated body side trim.
The big changes are under the hood, where three significantly revised EcoTec3 engines - a 4.3-liter V-6, a 5.3-liter V-8 and a 6.2-liter V-8 - are offered. The V-6 is a clone of the V-8s, with two fewer cylinders. All are built with aluminum blocks and cylinder heads and are light and compact for engines of their size. 
While the displacement numbers are the same as last year's offerings, the engines have been re-engineered with direct fuel injection, continuously variable valve timing and cylinder deactivation. Direct injection provides a measure of cylinder cooling, enabling a high compression ratio of 11:1. To accommodate the direct injection, the exhaust and intake passageways have been reconfigured and the spark plugs have been relocated, while the combustion chambers and piston tops have been shaped to better manage the spread of the ignition flame. A cylinder deactivation system helps trim fuel consumption.
The changes breathe new life into the family of G.M.'s venerable pushrod engines introduced in 1955 but revised many times since. While final fuel economy and horsepower numbers are not yet available, the automaker says the new power plants will provide more horsepower, more torque and better fuel economy than its current engines.
A 6-speed automatic is the only transmission offering. It is fitted with a system that downshifts to a lower gear when going downhill, using engine compression to reduce brake wear.
The suspensions are largely carry-overs, with independent dual control-arm systems in the front and a leaf-spring-mounted solid axle in the rear. Electric power steering replaces the hydraulic systems of the previous models.
While the truck cabs may look like those they replace, the structures are new and incorporate more high strength steel. Aluminum hoods help offset the weight of wider wheels, a larger battery and more substantial rear axles in V-8 models.
Both GMC and Chevrolet versions have been fitted with substantially revised interiors. Though similar, the GMC version has a more luxurious look, achieved in part with faux wood trim and visible stitching. A row of analog gauges now tops the speedometer and tachometer, and the climate control and infotainment systems have been given their own pod in the center of the dash.
G.M. introduced the two new vehicles to the press at the Michigan Motion Picture Studios in Pontiac. The studios were built as part of an effort to attract film business to Michigan in hopes of replacing auto industry jobs thought by some to have been lost for good when G.M. and Chrysler went through bankruptcy. Now the auto industry has rebounded, while efforts to establish a film industry have floundered, so it's not surprising that the vast studio was available for a winter vehicle introduction.
While sales of G.M. pickups are only a bit more than half of what they were during the automaker's best years, the 2011 figures were over 30 percent better than those of 2009. Ford's F-Series trucks continue to be America's best-selling vehicle line, but the nearly identical Sierra and Silverado are a close second with combined sales of 564,300 in 2011. Ford F-Series sales totaled 584,917 for the same year.

HEADLINE: Afghan Youth Orchestra to Visit America

BYLINE: DANIEL J. WAKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A youth orchestra from Afghanistan is to perform at the Kennedy Center in Washington and at Carnegie Hall in February. 

 BODY:
Hopes to bring an Afghan youth orchestra to the United States appear to have solidified. On Thursday the school's leaders released details of the performances, to take place at the Kennedy Center in Washington on Feb. 7 and at Carnegie Hall in New York on Feb. 12. 
The young musicians, who attend the Afghanistan National Institute of Music, will play side by side with players from the Maryland Classic Youth Orchestras in Washington and the Scarsdale High School Orchestra in New York, a news release said. Two traditional Afghan instrumental ensembles and a wind group will also perform. The violinist Mikhail Simonyan will serve as soloist in an arrangement of a traditional Afghan piece titled "Lariya."
The United States Embassy in Kabul, the Carnegie Corporation, the World Bank and Afghanistan's education ministry are financing the trip. "Key U.S. decision makers are slated to attend the Washington performance," the release said. In an interview in April the founder and director of the institute, Ahmad Sarmast, said the tour was partly intended to show the world some good news in Afghanistan, where music was banned by the Taliban in the 1990s.

HEADLINE: Republicans Stand in the Way of Disaster Relief (Again)

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: The G.O.P. thinks it's "wasteful" to pay for post-Sandy repairs. 

 BODY:
Republicans in Congress like to find ways to hold the economy, and ordinary Americans, hostage to their ideological agenda. Just as they are once again threatening another phony debt ceiling crisis that will jeopardize the nation's credit rating, they are, once again, threatening to withhold vital funds for Hurricane Sandy relief unless the Democrats agree to unrelated spending cuts. 
The White House has requested $60 billion in federal disaster relief to repair the damage caused by Sandy, but Republicans have balked. Rep. Scott Garrett of New Jersey called disaster relief "wasteful spending." And four other right-wing Republicans told The Hill that they would demand cuts in other programs to offset the expense.
Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho said "We have these emergencies every year and we should prepare for that in our budget." That's reasonable, but rich. In Sept. 2011, Senate Democrats approved $6.9 billion to refill the disaster emergency fund and House Republicans cut that amount by nearly half. Not yet satisfied, they demanded $1 billion in offsetting cuts from a loan program to develop energy-efficient automobiles.
Only in the labyrinth of the right would it make sense to cut a long-term program to deal with the fact of climate change and its impact on the environment to pay for storm-related devastation that is one of the effects of global warming.
In the not-so distant past, serious people in Washington generally disapproved of using disaster relief as a bargaining chip in the battle over deficit reduction. Even the United States Chamber of Commerce has opposed that kind of horse trading.
After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Tom DeLay of Texas, who was then House Majority Leader, said it was "right to borrow" for the sake of disaster relief, and argued that offsets would hurt the very economy Republicans were trying to save.
You have to sink pretty low to generate nostalgia for the Tom DeLay era.

HEADLINE: Storm Recovery Won't Be 'Business as Usual,' Official Says

BYLINE: MIREYA NAVARRO


HIGHLIGHT: Leading a post-hurricane task force, the nation's housing secretary says the vast majority of communities can be rebuilt safely, however. 

 BODY:
Visiting New York City, Shaun Donovan, the nation's housing secretary and President Obama's appointee to oversee the post-Hurricane Sandy federal recovery effort, said on Thursday that he expected most of the damaged areas along the East Coast to be rebuilt but not necessarily as they were before. 
Speaking in Lower Manhattan at a conference on waterfront restoration organized by the Municipal Art Society and Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, Mr. Donovan said long-term redevelopment would go beyond repairs and "just recreating what was there."
He said the recovery would require building sturdier structures but also questioning whether rebuilding makes sense in some cases. He later told reporters that "the vast majority of communities can be rebuilt safely."
He said making a recovery would involve "thousands of decisions" on matters like what materials to use, how to protect New York Harbor and ways to improve infrastructure like long-neglected tunnels and transit systems.
"Our response won't be business as usual," he said. "We need to harness this momentum to address weaknesses we've known about for years."
Mr. Donovan was short on specifics, saying, "My job is to come in and work with states and local communities to decide what the vision is and what makes sense."
His task force has been asked to identify and pave the way for rebuilding "in a manner that addresses existing and future risks and vulnerabilities."
Taking questions from the news media after his speech, he said that sea gates to block storm surges should not be "off the table" but that such a solution would be up to local governments . (Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg opposes them, but Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has said they should be explored.)
President Obama has asked Congress for $60.4 billion to help states affected by the storm. If approved, it could conceivably cover most of the $82 million in damage identified by the governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. And it could help rebuild homes and businesses, repair subway and other transportation and replenish eroded beaches.
Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, who also addressed the conference
after touring damage at Liberty Island, estimated the costs of response and recovery at national parks and other Department of Interior assets at $429 million, including $59 million in damages at the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island and $180 million at the Gateway National Recreation Area.
At the conference, held at the Museum of Jewish Heritage near Battery Park, Mr. Donovan said that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had already provided more than $1.1 billion in assistance "to hundreds of thousands of families" in the first month since the hurricane.
Mr. Donovan, a native New Yorker who served as Mayor Bloomberg's housing commissioner before assuming his federal post, said that President Obama was mindful of his ties to the region when he chose him to lead the task force.
Beyond his official responsibilities in the effort, "it is personal," Mr. Donovan said.

HEADLINE: Doctors Urge U.S. to Block Gas Export Terminals

BYLINE: JON HURDLE


HIGHLIGHT: Until the health implications of fracking are understood, they argue, the administration should not approve the infrastructure that would allow the export of vast quantities of natural gas. 

 BODY:
More than 100 physicians urged the Obama administration on Thursday not to approve the construction of liquefied natural gas export terminals until more is known about the health effects of hydraulic fracturing, the drilling process that has opened the way for a big increase in domestic gas production.
A group called Physicians, Scientists and Engineers for Healthy Energy, which conducts research into unconventional natural gas production, organized a petition arguing that exports of natural gas would increase such domestic drilling, known as fracking, exposing more people to chemicals that might damage their health. 
The petition, signed by 107 doctors, public health experts, environmental scientists, and academics, cited a growing number of anecdotal reports associating fracking with adverse health risks through human exposure to water, air and soil.
Despite reports that some people living near gas-drilling operations are suffering from respiratory, skin and gastrointestinal ailments, there is no established body of scientific evidence establishing whether fracking contaminates the local environment, the physicians noted.
Until policymakers and public health officials determine whether fracking is dangerous to human health, they argue, the government should not allow the development of the 15 new export terminals that have been proposed by the gas industry. The government has so far approved one export terminal, proposed by Cheniere Energy, in Louisiana.
"There is a paucity of objective, evidence-based epidemiological research," Dr. Madelon Finkel, a professor of public health at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York City, said during a conference call with reporters.
The petition follows the publication on Dec. 4 of a government study concluding that the economic benefits of LNG exports would outweigh the impacts of the higher domestic prices that may result. The report has encouraged speculation that more projects will be approved.
The demand for exports has arisen from a recent boom in domestic production resulting from the use of fracking in combination with horizontal drilling, which has allowed the industry to exploit vast shale gas reserves at an affordable cost. Energy companies are also lured by sharply higher natural gas prices overseas.
The natural gas industry denies there is any link between fracking and environmental contamination, arguing that the chemicals used to help release gas from shale beds are injected into the ground through multiple layers of steel and concrete and released into the shale beneath thousands of feet of impervious rock. 
Dan Whitten, a spokesman for America's Natural Gas Alliance, dismissed the physicians' concerns.
"There is no basis in fact or science for the assertions made by this group," Mr. Whitten said in a statement. "Natural gas is produced safely and responsibly every day, and that production is governed by extensive federal, state and local regulations."
But Dr. Adam Law, a physician at Cayuga Medical Center in Ithaca, N.Y., said that researchers are finding "measurable" levels of pollutants from the gas industry in the air and water that are associated with the risk of illness, and that the first studies describing such exposure are entering the medical literature.
Seth Shonkoff, executive director of the physicians' group, said that a current investigation into fracking by the Environmental Protection Agency would not fully establish whether fracking is safe because it is concerned only with its effects on water. 
The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the petition.

HEADLINE: Assessing the Financial Burden of Being an M.T.A Rider

BYLINE: CLYDE HABERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: The Day: Data shows that, on a percentage basis, New Yorkers pay a good deal more than others at the turnstile, and Albany and City Hall are less generous than state and local governments elsewhere. 

 BODY:
 With mass-transit fares about to go up - yet again, most New Yorkers would add wearily - this is a good time to pry a statistic out of the recesses of wonkdom where it usually huddles. It is called the farebox operating ratio, an unlovely phrase for calculating what riders pay out of their own pockets to keep a transit system going.
 If that ratio is high, then government support for rail and bus systems is relatively low. With the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, you may not be surprised to hear, the figure is appreciably higher than that for other big American cities. 
 First, it must be recognized that subways and buses cannot operate solely on money taken from passengers. At least, it is impossible unless fares are raised to levels so high that they induce nosebleeds and incite the populace to rebellion. So governments have to chip in - a lot - to keep the wheels rolling.
 One way to measure how they're doing is to look at the farebox operating ratio. For the transportation authority, it was 54 percent in September, the most recent reporting period. In other words, riders throughout the region covered more than half the cost of their commute.
 Not all passengers are equal, though, in this regard.
 The burden is significantly greater for New York City subway riders. Their ratio is 72 percent, according to an analysis by the National Transit Database, part of the federal Transportation Department. It means that nearly three of every four dollars needed to run the subways come directly from MetroCard swipes. For city bus riders, the comparable ratio is only 37 percent. It is 49 percent for those who use the Long Island Rail Road and 59 percent for those on Metro-North.
 The federal study also shows that the subway ratio is a good deal higher here than in other cities. In Atlanta, it's 34 percent, in Boston 50 percent, in Philadelphia 51 percent, in Chicago 53 percent.
 There is an uplifting way to assess the numbers.
 "What it indicates," said Aaron Donovan, a spokesman for the New York authority, "is that the M.T.A. is more self-sufficient than almost any other transit agency in the country, if not any other, in terms of generating revenue from itself without relying on a taxpayer subsidy."
 Another way to look at it is that, on a percentage basis, New Yorkers pay a good deal more than others at the turnstile, and Albany and City Hall are less generous than state and local governments elsewhere. How useful is this sort of comparison? Well, said Gene Russianoff, staff lawyer for the advocacy group called the Straphangers Campaign, "it's the only metric that measures how much of a burden there is on the riding public on a nationwide basis."
 The burden for New Yorkers may yet grow heavier, with looming fare increases being but part of the problem.
 In a broad tax deal reached a year ago, the governor and the Legislature exempted some businesses from a payroll tax that was created in 2009 to prop up the ever-troubled transportation authority. That payroll tax was exceedingly unpopular in many quarters, notably with suburban lawmakers. Those new exemptions cost the authority $310 million but, Mr. Donovan said, Albany made good on a promise to cover the losses by tapping other sources.
 Over the summer, a new threat emerged, one that could cost the authority $1.8 billion, when a state judge on Long Island declared the entire payroll tax to be unconstitutional. But transit bosses, confident that the appellate courts will rule in their favor, seem unworried that the $1.8 billion is about to disappear.
 Still, these battles in the courts and in Albany reinforce how creaky mass-transit finances can be and how tough it is to spread the burden so that riders alone don't take it on the chin.
 Some ask why anyone who doesn't ride the subway should help pay for it. Actually, they don't ask so much as protest. The short response is that pretty much all New Yorkers benefit from mass transit, whether or not they use it.
 They include businesses that would like employees to show up on time, stores that want customers to reach them, car drivers who don't wish the roads to be more clogged than they already are and real-estate developers whose properties are enhanced by a sound transportation network. All of them are taxed or tolled for a reason.
 Without subways that work, the city shrivels, and then so does the entire state. This is an economic fact of life.
 "The whole philosophy of funding subways and buses is that everyone who benefits pays," Mr. Russianoff said. That definitely includes the riders. But it shouldn't mean only the riders, he said.

 BODY:
The other night I came home from work and looked out my kitchen windows at a new kind of darkness that was far darker than the night sky. Up to that moment, I could see from my fourth floor window all of central Park Slope, the apex of which was the steeple of the Old First Reformed Church on Carroll Street, where I went to nursery school. For the six years I'd lived in the Brooklyn neighborhood of Gowanus, I had done the dishes, chopped vegetables and served guests wine across my kitchen island while looking up through that window at the church's steeple, visible between the new high-rises on Fourth Avenue. 
When I encountered that horribly flat dark, I ran to my roof to investigate. I was sickened by what I saw. But I was not shocked. I had known that sooner or later, this night would come. Some developers had bought the parking lot two buildings east of mine. I had shaken hands with them at a community board meeting, where they had promised to build only two stories and a mezzanine - about 35 feet high. 
But then they added a floor. My sweet view of the neighborhood where I grew up, a view that I always knew was only borrowed, that I had no legal right to keep, was gone forever. The view from our kitchen window is now hostile and anonymous. We look at a cinder-block wall with a strip of sky above it just big enough to remind us of what we lost. 
My wife and son and I live on the third and fourth floors of a building that I bought with partners a decade ago from a man who used it as a factory, making machine airplane parts. When I bought it, the building was dark, semi-industrial and wonderfully quiet. There were cinder blocks in all the windows. I imagined what might be seen when they were broken up, and I yelled out in victory after my contractor gave me a crowbar and I pulled some of those cinder blocks out of the window frames and poked my head through where my new windows would go. Light and views and air rushed in from every direction. 
I remember feeling so good after moving in, as if I had a secret. The secret was not that I had worked hard for what I had, but that I had been rewarded far in excess of my careful planning. Mine was the tallest building on the street, which afforded me views from every room. Though it was a hundred years old and made of bricks and four-inch-thick beams, it felt fragile to me, surrounded by nothing on all four sides. Even my building's lot line windows - those windows that open onto airshafts in more developed neighborhoods - looked out onto backyards, most with gardens and barbecues, a few others littered with decaying cars.
Mine are urban views - some might call them ugly. They're really just vestiges of an earlier time when we didn't all build as densely as we possibly could. But they were part of what made me fall deeply in love with my building. When construction was finished and I moved in, I didn't know that when the roof leaked I would feel the kind of crippling sadness I had, until then, imagined would overwhelm me only when someone I loved was ill. Now, after living for some years in a place that I love and understand, I can conceive of what people who live in the country mean when they talk about their land being a part of them. My building has become a part of me. 
Until recently I didn't stop to ask, what happens when you stop moving? Now I know. Everything moves around you. 
A wonderful family bought a cabinetmaker's 10,000-square-foot shop to the east of me, in what might have been an even greater deal than mine. On their roof, which had been rotting for years, railings and picnic tables and plants went up, and a sauna. But when they were done, I could still see over the sauna to Manhattan. And I felt lucky again. 
A year later, next door to the west, a new two-family house stole a view from one of my bathrooms, and the dull gray cinder blocks went up inches away from lot-line windows that had previously let light stream into a closet and a hallway. Those little room views of mine were so sweet and weird they were almost obnoxious, in that I never felt I deserved them, and so I accepted their loss without tears, and smiled at my new neighbors. 
A year after that I remained stoic about the new glow from the north of another cinder-block box - a Super 8 motel. Then, last winter, the Jewish Press building two blocks to the south, a rumpled beige giant on Third Avenue, was purchased. Within weeks it was clad on all sides in bright blue metal. Now, from my living room, I look at a huge Storage Deluxe sign that is lit up like a highway billboard all through the night. A visitor said it looked a bit like an Ed Ruscha picture, framed nearly perfectly by all of one window. But I've never loved Ed Ruscha. 
A reprieve came with the economic downturn. It felt as if the money coursing through the city had bled straight back down into the ground, and new construction ceased. I watched workers climb down from half finished projects, lock them up, and drive away. The Toll Brothers pulled out of a foolish deal for a parcel of land on the Gowanus Canal because of its Superfund status, which saved those of us who live here (not forever - never forever) from more awful 12-story buildings that seemed determined to erase the low buildings that define our neighborhood.
So, miraculously, the views along the Gowanus remain intact, for now. I can still see the F train as it rumbles in and out of the Carroll Street stop, a mile away. I can see church steeples in Carroll Gardens and shipping cranes in the Red Hook piers.
But I know all that will go. On the Internet, on community watchdog sites, I watch the plans go up for all kinds of awful buildings. I go to community board meetings in local schools and catch myself wringing my hands. Cinder blocks are being unloaded again. Every bit of land has been discovered. The parking lots and the few remaining low-slung factory buildings where candles are made and iron is bent for railings all have price tags attached. The Lightstone Group is trying to do just what the Toll Brothers realized was too foolish to try - put up a huge apartment building in a flood zone that is also a Superfund zone. Do they know that the Gowanus sends sewage into the basements of the residents already living here whenever there's even an inch of rain? They know. They don't care.
My sadness is not really about views. It comes from my choice to live in one place long enough to plant roots, to grow, and to care. Now I understand what I did not realize when I got lucky and was able to move here. The fact that I have stayed does not mean that I have struck some bargain with the city. Instead, the city grows around me. 
I don't deserve sympathy. When I moved in, I wanted to build an enormous bulkhead on my roof, with many windows. People just like me came to my community board hearing, and they voted against my desire. My request was later denied by the Board of Standards and Appeals. I wasn't angry at my neighbors; I was glad they got their say. Besides, many of them had been here far longer than I had - and I respected that. 
In my more optimistic moments, I wonder if my newest neighbors will do the same, and let me paint their dull gray lot line wall a bright yellow.

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times: 
Making job creation its primary motive for intervention in the financial markets, the Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it planned to keep interest rates low as long as unemployment hovers at above-average rates. Binyamin Appelbaum writes that the move by the central bank underscores the concerns of monetary policy makers about the economic recovery. 
Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio is trying to contain the dissent within the Republican conference over negotiations with the White House for a deal to avoid tax increases and spending cuts that could send the country back into recession. Jonathan Weisman reports that Republican leaders have said that Mr. Boehner needs a unified party behind him if he is to hold out for a conservative deficit deal, but his defectors are pushing him to either let taxes rise on incomes higher than $250,000 or take a ride into the fiscal unknown next month.
Having once derided the Bush-era tax cuts as irresponsible, Democrats now find themselves pushing to make most of the tax breaks permanent.Annie Lowrey explains that income stagnation over the past decade has put Democrats in an awkward position in the fiscal talks, forcing them to advocate for the tax breaks instead of letting them expire to provide more revenue for entitlement programs.
President Obama chided the Syrian military on Wednesday for firing powerful Scud missiles at rebels, but was not moved to intervene militarily, Michael R. Gordon and Eric Schmitt write. The Obama administration has declined to join Allied forces in supporting opposition fighters in Syria but could be compelled to act if President Bashar al-Assad uses chemical weapons.
"Zero Dark Thirty," a not-yet-released film about the hunt for Osama bin Laden, is dividing critics and journalists on the subject of torture, which is also the subject of a 6,000-page report due Thursday from the Senate Intelligence Committee, Scott Shane writes.
 Happening in Washington: 
Economic data expected today include the producer price index for November, retail sales for last month and weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m., followed at 10 by business inventories for October and weekly mortgage rates.
At 7 p.m., The Times' Rachel Swarns will discuss her book, "American Tapestry," about Michelle Obama's genealogy, at the National Archives.
At 7:40 p.m., President Obama will speak at the White House's Hanukkah reception.
At 8 p.m., Justice Elena Kagan will discuss law and justice at the Sixth & I Historic Synagogue.

HEADLINE: After North Korea's Missile Launch

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: Northeast Asia is scrambling to deal with the fallout of the launch and speculation is growing that North Korea will next carry out a nuclear test. 

 BODY:
"No one can ignore us from now." 
These few words, spoken by a North Korean citizen, Jo Chang-ho, in this report by the South Korean international TV broadcaster, Arirang, said so much.
Mr. Jo was referring to the successful launch by his country of a long-range rocket on Wednesday that put a 200-pound, or 90-kilogram, earth surveillance satellite into orbit. The international community believes the launch is a test run for ballistic missile technology that, if perfected, could one day carry nuclear warheads across Asia and across the Pacific to the United States. 
As well as joining the elite group of nine nations with nuclear weapons, North Korea also joins a small club of just 10 nations that can launch a satellite on their own. All of which threatens to shift the balance of power in Northeast Asia, said some South Korean commentators. 
Most immediately, putting into orbit the Kwangmyongsong-3, or Shining Star-3, satellite, has dramatically boosted the image and authority of Kim Jung-un, the young North Korean leader, my colleague in Seoul, Choe Sang-Hun, reported.
"In the insular world of North Korea, the country's ability to send a rocket hurtling hundreds of miles on roughly the course it set is a fulfillment of promises that have kept people loyal to the Kim dynasty for decades," Sang-Hun wrote. "Under that mythology, the launching was a sign that the so-called arduous march - soldiering on despite isolation and sanctions - was paying off, building a nuclear deterrent that would keep imperialist powers at bay."
In terms of North Korea's international image, too, it's a turnaround for the chubby, 29-year-old Mr. Kim, whose father, Kim Jong-il, ruled before him, and whose grandfather, Kim Il-sung, founded the state in 1948.
Mr. Kim was ridiculed in headlines around the world late last month after The Onion, an American satirical publication and Web site, named him "Sexiest Man Alive for 2012," and the People's Daily, the official mouthpiece of China's Communist Party, apparently took the award seriously.
The Onion had another try at levity over Wednesday's launch, "reporting" that Mr. Kim's glamorous wife had escaped on the missile.
The truth of course is very different.
Today, Northeast Asia is scrambling to deal with the fallout of the launch and speculation is growing North Korea may next carry out a nuclear test, Reuters reports. 
North Korea's test also threatens to spark a wider arms race in a region already unsettled by an increasingly aggressive territorial dispute between China and Japan over uninhabited islands in the East China Sea.
The launch came a day before a Chinese marine surveillance plane crossed into what Japan considers its airspace around the islands, causing Japan to scramble fighter jets for the first time in the dispute. 
And it came a week before presidential elections in South Korea.
As The Korea Herald, a South Korean English-language newspaper, wrote, North Korea was now in a "psychologically superior position" to South Korea with this latest step towards gaining high-level nuclear weapons capability. 
"As North Korea inches toward its goal of de facto nuclear power status, its fledgling leadership is expected to pursue a more aggressive, bolder external policy," the newspaper wrote.
A commentary in the People's Daily appealed for calm.
"Rational thinking tells us" that "the more critical the situation the more need to maintain calm," ran the article in Chinese signed by the pseudonymous Zhong Sheng, whose name is believed to stand for "the voice of the center." 
"The Korean peninsula cannot sustain vicious cycles, this is the basic thinking that one should have when discussing the security situation," Zhong Sheng wrote.
So while China, North Korea's longtime ally, has officially voiced "regret" at the launch - something that was noted in Washington - it also offered support, saying North Korea "is entitled to the peaceful use of outer space," the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman, Hong Lei, said on Wednesday. 
For its part, the United States and its allies are talking of stronger international sanctions against North Korea, as my colleagues David E. Sanger and William J. Broad wrote.
But there is considerable doubt about how far China would join in efforts to increase, say, the strict embargoes on goods going in and out of North Korea. Why?
"Beijing's biggest fear has always been destabilizing North Korea, and setting off a collapse that could put South Korean forces, and perhaps their American allies, on China's border," write David and Bill.

HEADLINE: Deal Makers Peering Into the Unknown

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Participants at DealBook's inaugural conference spoke candidly about their concerns in an uncertain environment. | A guilty plea of wire fraud for the Tiger Asia hedge fund. | Investors give SolarCity a cool response. | Wall Street bigwigs showed up at Madison Square Garden for the 12-12-12 benefit concert for victims of Hurricane Sandy. 

 BODY:
The investors, chief executives and economists at DealBook's inaugural conference on Wednesday spoke candidly about their concerns in an uncertain environment. They warned of risks, like the fiscal impasse in Washington and the debt crisis in Europe, and identified opportunities. There was even a reference to Justin Bieber, when Paul Krugman admitted he had never heard the pop star's music.
 Jamie Dimon, the head of JPMorgan Chase, said his bank's big trading loss this year "caused a little turmoil," prompting a shake-up in the executive ranks. On his own plans, Mr. Dimon said he was "not suited" to be the next Treasury secretary. Lloyd C. Blankfein of Goldman Sachs, who had previously said his wife read the newspaper for him, is reading the papers himself now, he said. Mr. Blankfein added that there was a "close to 100 percent" probability that the next leader of Goldman would be someone now working at the firm. 
There was plenty of bank-and-forth on investment strategies. Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates was bullish on emerging markets, saying the squeeze on their currencies was largely over. Stephen A. Schwarzman said the Blackstone Group was moving into high-yielding bank debt with floating interest rates, while David M. Rubenstein of the Carlyle Group said New York City apartments above the 60th floor were selling at bubble prices. When asked about insider trading, Mr. Schwarzman offered a personal anecdote about Dennis Levine, the banker at the center of the 1980s scandals, who, Mr. Schwarzman said, was stealing his deals while they were colleagues at Lehman Brothers.
GUILTY PLEA FOR 'TIGER CUB' FUND | The insider trading charges continue to pile up. On Wednesday, Bill Hwang, a protégé of the hedge fund manager Julian Robertson, entered a guilty plea of wire fraud on behalf of his fund, Tiger Asia, DealBook's Peter Lattman reports. Federal prosecutors, who did not charge Mr. Hwang himself, said the trading scheme generated about $17 million in illegal profits.
Mr. Hwang and his head trader, Ray Park, also settled a parallel lawsuit brought against them by the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Lattman writes: "Mr. Hwang and his fund will pay $44 million in fines, and he agreed to a five-year ban from the securities industry. Mr. Park agreed to a three-year ban." The case is part of the government's broader crackdown on insider trading, and it is a black eye for Mr. Robertson, who has mentored a group of protégés known as Tiger cubs. At its peak, Tiger Asia managed more than $5 billion.
SAC Capital Advisors is beginning to feel the effects of the government's investigation, as six of its former employees have been linked to insider trading. Some SAC investors "have begun to contemplate thinking about perhaps withdrawing money" from the hedge fund, Jesse Eisinger writes in his column, The Trade. "Congratulations. What took them so long?"
Investors pressure hedge fund managers to generate returns but "seem to demonstrate little interest in whether the person is ethical and trustworthy. Shouldn't their threshold be a wee bit higher?" Mr. Eisinger writes. "Many institutional investors have so perfected the art of looking the other way that they make bystanders on a New York City subway platform look like models of social responsibility." The head of SAC, Steven A. Cohen, has been called the Michael Jordan of investing. But, Mr. Eisinger says, "what if he is the Lance Armstrong?"
SOLARCITY'S TEPID RECEPTION | Investors are less than thrilled with SolarCity, a company that installs solar panels for homeowners. After a delay, the company priced its initial public offering well below its earlier estimates, selling 11.5 million shares at $8 apiece and raising about $92 million. The expectation had been to price shares at $13 and $15 each to raise as much as $151 million.
SolarCity is the first clean tech company to stage an I.P.O. in some time, and its performance will be closely watched for signs about the prospects of the industry. Its stock is expected to begin trading on Thursday. In an Op-Ed essay in The New York Times, David Crane, president of the energy company NRG, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. write that "the economics makes sense" to bring solar power to more customers. "All we need is the political will."
ON THE AGENDA | The House Financial Services Committee conducts a hearing at 9 a.m. on the effect of the Volcker Rule on markets and businesses. Data on retail sales for November is out at 8:30 a.m. The Producer Price Index for November is also out at 8:30 a.m. Joe Echeverria, chief executive of Deloitte, is on Bloomberg TV at 3:20 p.m. Adobe Systems reports results after the market closes.
FINANCIERS SALUTE THE BOSS | Wall Street bigwigs showed up at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday for the 12-12-12 benefit concert for victims of Hurricane Sandy. The program was a marathon of rock legends like Bruce Springsteen, Billy Joel, Jon Bon Jovi, Eric Clapton and Paul McCartney. In attendance: Gary Cohn of Goldman Sachs and the hedge fund managers William A. Ackman and Whitney Tilson, according to DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced. Lloyd C. Blankfein was also there, according to Bloomberg News. David Gura of Marketplace snapped a picture of the Goldman Sachs chief.

HEADLINE: DealBook Conference Was Impressive, Lucrative and Chummy

BYLINE: MARGARET SULLIVAN


HIGHLIGHT: Innovation is necessary, but for an event of this kind, questions are raised about journalistic distance. 

 BODY:
There was a lot happening at the inaugural DealBook conference on Wednesday -- and much of it was undeniably impressive.
Here is what the invitation-only conference had going for it: Big Wall Street names, flashy graphics, edgy Global Chill music, weighty discussions of economic challenges, a few good laughs and even some news tidbits. And, with the pricey tickets and the all-platforms-blazing corporate sponsorships, the event brought in plenty of much-needed revenue for The Times.
Here is what the conference did not have going for it: A great deal of distance between sources and those who cover them -- something traditionally thought to be a bedrock journalistic idea. 
I stopped in a couple of times at TheTimesCenter, and caught the Dealbook editor at large Andrew Ross Sorkin's interview with the Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd C. Blankfein, as well as a session with the economist and columnist Paul Krugman. Mr. Krugman, of course, is not only a Nobel laureate, but also a rock star among the wonkish set; his presence lent the event gravitas and credibility. (One of his first questions from the audience came from a woman who thanked him effusively for his presence and gushed that she felt like "a 13-year-old at a Justin Bieber concert.")
DealBook - a blog and print section dedicated to coverage of mergers and acquisitions and other related subjects -- is something of an oddity at The Times. A rainmaker for the company, it has garnered its share of critics who see it as too soft on its sources.
Matt Taibbi at Rolling Stone is a particularly harsh critic, portraying Mr. Sorkin as allowing those he sees as Wall Street villains to get off easy for wrecking America's economy over the past decade. (Indeed, during his Wednesday chat, Mr. Blankfein spoke the inevitable words "mistakes were made" - Wall Street's idea of a mea culpa.)
More than anything, DealBook is one of those creatures of 21st-century journalism - as much about "brand" as anything else.
The conference did a great deal to burnish the DealBook brand. At one point, looking at the stage from the audience, I saw seven DealBook logos staring back at me.
It also produced revenue. BlackBerry was the conference's "founding sponsor," and its advertising deal put it on every platform in sight. Interestingly, BlackBerry's participation suggested that it didn't hold a grudge for the article The Times did just a couple of months ago, making fun of those who still use BlackBerry devices instead of hipper alternatives like the iPhone.
Such sponsorships are another creature of 21st-century newspapering, eroding the sharp line between advertising and editorial content.
I talked on Thursday with Mr. Sorkin, who said he was pleased with the day.
"I consider it live journalism, and I felt that some headlines came out of it," he said. (The event was live-blogged on The Times's Web site, which also offered a live webcast.) He mentioned, particularly, the optimism of Mr. Blankfein and others about the likelihood of a resolution to the so-called fiscal cliff, and the Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio's ideas about a bond bubble.
Ultimately, though, "it was more about the richness of the discussion," Mr. Sorkin said.
Was the event too chummy, too clubby, and is DealBook itself that way, too?
"I don't think there's any truth to that," Mr. Sorkin said. "We ask very pointed questions."
In its first event of this kind, The Times put together a smooth, impressive and star-studded day, and it made none of the clumsy errors that The Los Angeles Times did in its Staples Center debacle or The Washington Post in its aborted "Salongate" plans.
But given the lunchtime rollout of a new Blackberry device, the overall friendly questioning of prominent newsmakers, the reception afterward - featuring wine, hors d'oeuvres and the incessant rubbing of journalistic and corporate elbows -- the word "adversarial" did not come to mind. Nor did the word "watchdog."
Most audience members paid handsomely to be "invited" - most tickets were $1,500, others less. Given that they were coming to see people like Mr. Blankfein -- other big names were the JPMorgan Chase chairman Jamie Dimon and the Google chairman Eric Schmidt - The Times's indebtedness to these sources lurks in the shadows. (The participants were not paid for their appearances.)
I asked Gerald Marzorati, the editor who organized the event, about that.
"I can understand that question, but I see no evidence of a problem," he said, other than one of "the optics" - that is, the appearance as opposed to reality. Once on stage, he noted, the journalists did their part admirably and The Times's news coverage of the participants has been tough-minded.
In the end, what's in it for the audience is "a great show and the chance to mingle with one another," Mr. Marzorati said. What's in it for the headliners is "not about cozying up to Times journalists, but the ability to talk about things other than their day jobs" - like matters of public policy.
Mr. Marzorati noted that with every innovation in Times history - whether starting new features sections three decades ago, or bringing the statistics guru Nate Silver on board recently -- "there are always people who say: 'My God, you can't do that. It's not us.' " In time, the ventures are well accepted.
It's 2012, and newspaper companies need radical change, including new ways of finding the revenue to support their journalism. The old model is broken and The Times is right to look for new solutions. Still, some aspects of this particular solution can't help but make me a little queasy.
A previous version of this article misstated Andrew Ross Sorkin's title. He is the editor at large at Dealbook, not the editor in chief.

HEADLINE: Deposit Insurance Bill Is Blocked in the Senate

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
The Senate on Thursday failed to clear a bill that would have extended for two more years a program that provided federal insurance for deposits kept in no-interest accounts at federally insured banks. 
The arrangement, known as the Transaction Account Guarantee program, was created during the financial crisis to help shore up banks by increasing their deposit base. In the months after the program began in 2008, some $500 billion flowed into the accounts, which now total about $1.5 trillion, analysts say.
On Thursday, however, a bill that would have extended the policy through the end of 2014 failed to garner the 60 votes necessary to end debate and bring the measure to a vote.
Small to midsize banks supported the extension, as did the Obama administration, but larger banks and credit unions opposed the bill. Analysts said they expected $200 million to $300 million in cash to move from the accounts into money markets and other interest-bearing instruments in the weeks ahead.
A similar procedural hurdle was easily cleared on Tuesday by a vote of 76 to 20. This time, however, only 50 senators supported bringing the proposal to the floor.
The drop in support largely came from Republicans who had voted affirmatively on Tuesday. On Thursday, however, Republicans raised a budget point of order, saying that the bill violated the Budget Control Act because it authorized additional government financing.
The cost of the program is not borne by the government but by fees paid by banks participating in the program. Nevertheless, if a bank failed with those types of deposits, taxpayers would be responsible for paying.
Senate aides said the defeat also had less to do with the substance of the bill than with a continuing fight between the two parties over Senate rules. After the Tuesday vote, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, proposed placeholder amendments that shut out any chance for Republicans to offer amendments.
That tactic led Republicans to invoke the point of order, which required 60 votes to override.
Frank Keating, the president of the American Bankers Association, said that while his members were disappointed, they were prepared for the setback. ''Banks already have been communicating about the possible expiration,'' Mr. Keating said, ''and will work with their business customers to demonstrate the safety of their deposits.''

HEADLINE: Afghan Youth Orchestra To Visit United States

BYLINE: By DANIEL J. WAKIN

 BODY:
Hopes to bring an Afghan youth orchestra to the United States appear to have solidified. On Thursday the organizers of the tour released details of the performances, to take place at the Kennedy Center in Washington on Feb. 7 and at Carnegie Hall in New York on Feb. 12. 
The young musicians, who attend the Afghanistan National Institute of Music, will play side by side with players from the Maryland Classic Youth Orchestras in Washington and the Scarsdale High School Orchestra in New York, a news release said. Two traditional Afghan instrumental ensembles and a wind group will also perform. The violinist Mikhail Simonyan will serve as soloist in an arrangement of a traditional Afghan piece titled "Lariya."
The United States Embassy in Kabul, the Carnegie Corporation, the World Bank and Afghanistan's education ministry are financing the trip. "Key U.S. decision makers are slated to attend the Washington performance," the release said. In an interview in April the founder and director of the institute, Ahmad Sarmast, said the tour was partly intended to show the world some good news in Afghanistan, where music was banned by the Taliban in the 1990s.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: To Gain From Rising Sales, G.M. Redesigns Pickups

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
PONTIAC, Mich. -- Signs of recovery in the housing and construction industries have given a much-needed lift to the market for full-size pickup trucks, which took a beating during the recession.
But so far this year, only two of Detroit's automakers, Ford Motor and Chrysler, have benefited from rising sales of pickups and the hefty profits they generate. General Motors, the nation's biggest automaker, has been trailing far behind, stuck with the oldest truck models on the market, and piling up big inventories of unsold vehicles.
To combat the perception that its pickups are losing ground, G.M. on Thursday ceremoniously unveiled redesigned versions of its Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups -- six months before they even hit the market. 
''We have the oldest truck out there, no question about it,'' Mark Reuss, head of G.M.'s North American operations, said at the truck event, which was held at a movie studio built on the site of a former G.M. assembly plant. ''But we think these new models are going to be the best engineered pickups out there.''
None of the Detroit automakers can afford to lag in the pickup market, one of the few segments in which American manufacturers still dominate, with more than a 90 percent share.
Analysts estimate that the auto companies can earn up to $10,000 in profit on each pickup they sell, which is considerably more than on most passenger cars and sport utility vehicles.
Mr. Reuss said that many of G.M.'s product programs were stalled during its financial crisis, which prompted a $50 billion government bailout and a restructuring in bankruptcy court.
The new versions of the Silverado and Sierra are the first complete redesigns since 2006. In the interim, both Ford and Chrysler have brought models to market that are taking the largest portion of gains in the segment.
Pickup sales are up about 9.6 percent this year through November, a sizable increase but still less than the 13.9 percent gain for total vehicle sales in the United States. Even so, G.M. has not seen its fortunes rise with the rest of the pickup market.
Ford's F-series pickup -- the nation's best-selling vehicle of any kind -- has posted an 11.6 percent sales increase for the first 11 months of the year, to 576,000 pickups. Chrysler's Ram pickup sales have improved 20.3 percent, to 263,000. Even Toyota, a distant fourth in the segment, has seen sales of its Tundra pickup rise 23.7 percent, to 91,000.
Combined sales of G.M.'s Silverado and Sierra models, however, have increased only 1.2 percent, to 506,000 for the first 11 months.
''The market is getting stronger and it is very, very competitive,'' said Mr. Reuss.
G.M. ended November with about a 140-day inventory of Silverados, which is about double the industry standard of 60 to 70 days of supply. To clear out the backlog, G.M. raised its truck incentives an unspecified amount this month to generate more showroom traffic.
Previously, the G.M. trucks trailed Chrysler's Ram in sales incentives. The auto-research Web site TrueCar.com said that Chrysler offered average incentives of $4,700 on the Ram during November, compared with about $4,000 for the Silverado.
''We're not going to sit out and watch the market going by us,'' said Alan Batey, head of G.M.'s sales in the United States.
To that end, G.M. has spent heavily to improve the look and capability of the pickups that arrive next year. Mr. Reuss declined to specify what the overall development costs were but said they were the highest of any vehicle the company had introduced since it emerged from bankruptcy three years ago.
''This is a multibillion-dollar investment that contributes billions in profits,'' said Joseph Phillippi, head of the consulting firm Auto Trends in Short Hills, N.J. ''This is the equivalent of the corporate A.T.M.''
The truck event on Thursday had all the trappings of a lavish auto-show introduction, including a Silverado emerging with explosive sound effects from a fake block of granite.
Mr. Reuss and other G.M. officials said the new models would come equipped with either a traditional V-8 engine or a smaller, more fuel-efficient six-cylinder engine.
He declined to specify the fuel economy on the new models, saying that revelation would come closer to the actual production date next year.
Ford's F-series trucks equipped with V-6 engines get 16 miles per gallon in city driving and 22 miles per gallon on the highway. G.M.'s current Silverado model with a six-cylinder engine achieves 15 miles per gallon in the city and 20 in highway driving.

HEADLINE: Economic Indicators Bolster Optimism for U.S. Recovery

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits fell sharply last week to a near four-year low, and retail sales rebounded in November, offering hopeful signs for the United States' struggling economic recovery. 
Initial claims for state unemployment aid fell for a fourth consecutive week, dropping by 29,000 to a seasonally adjusted 343,000, the Labor Department said on Thursday. They are now at their lowest level since early October, and within a hair of territory last seen in early 2008.
Another report suggested consumer spending picked up last month despite fear Washington would fail to avoid harsh austerity measures that could push the nation into recession. Worries over the automatic tax increases and spending cuts that would go into effect if Republicans and the White House cannot reach an agreement on the so-called fiscal cliff hit consumer sentiment hard in early December.
A slow but steady improvement in the labor market has helped support consumer spending, which propped up economic growth in the third quarter when business investment sagged.
Economic growth is expected to slow in the fourth quarter, hurt by slower inventory growth and a reduction in investment by companies worried about the continuing economic negotiations.
However, the economy does appear to be bouncing back after Hurricane Sandy, which made landfall in the East Coast in late October and led to a spike in jobless claims.
The four-week moving average for new claims, which irons out weekly volatility, dropped by 27,000, to 381,500.
''The labor market might be improving a bit quicker than expected,'' said David Sloan, an economist at 4Cast in New York.
The Commerce Department said retail sales rose 0.3 percent last month, rebounding from October's 0.3 percent decline. The increase fell short of the forecast in a Reuters poll of economists, but a measure of core sales exceeded expectations.
The core retail sales figure, which excludes automobiles, gasoline and building materials, rose 0.5 percent in November. The government uses this measure to calculate consumer spending.
The Commerce Department also said business inventories, a critical component of economic growth, rose 0.4 percent in October, in line with expectations.

HEADLINE: A Fed Focused On the Value Of Clarity

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
The Federal Reserve's decision on Wednesday to announce specific economic objectives for its policies would have stunned and dismayed earlier generations of central bankers, who regarded secrecy as a virtue and obfuscation as a prized technique for manipulating financial markets.
''Since I've become a central banker, I've learned to mumble with great coherence,'' Alan Greenspan, a former Fed chairman, told reporters in 1987. ''If I seem unduly clear to you, you must have misunderstood what I said.'' 
But a greater appreciation for the virtues of transparency has been one of the most important shifts in central banking in recent decades. It is a response to public demands for increased accountability and an embrace of economic research on monetary policy that finds speaking clearly is more effective than mumbling. The Fed's vice chairwoman, Janet Yellen, last month described the result as a ''revolution.''
Until recently, the Fed under Mr. Greenspan and his successor, Ben S. Bernanke, were tentative participants in this revolution. Mr. Bernanke spoke often about the need to speak clearly, but there were few tangible changes.
It now appears that he was simply busy dealing with a financial crisis. Over the last two years, Mr. Bernanke and his colleagues have announced a series of changes intended to increase the transparency of the Fed's decision-making. Some of those moves have also transformed the way those decisions are made and, the Fed hopes, increased the power of its efforts to revive the economy.
Several of those changes were tied together by Wednesday's announcement that the Fed would hold short-term interest rates near zero as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent and inflation remained under control.
The new policy quantifies the goals that the Fed formally articulated for the first time in a statement in January. It extends the Fed's recent willingness to forecast the level of interest rates. It will require the Fed to publish a consensus forecast of inflation for the first time. And it was announced on Wednesday, Mr. Bernanke said, in part because he was scheduled to hold a news conference, another of his innovations.
The Fed's push to speak more clearly is partly motivated by political considerations. During the prosperous 1990s, the success of monetary policy was its own justification. After a financial crisis that the Fed failed to avert or predict, in the fourth year of a recovery that continues to disappoint, the Fed has no better defense than to explain what it is doing as clearly as possible.
It is primarily the result, however, of taking research seriously. While some economists, notably Milton Friedman, long argued that transparency would fortify the Fed's independence, the economic case crystallized more recently.
''It was an article of faith in central banking that secrecy about monetary policy decisions was the best policy,'' Ms. Yellen recalled in a recent speech.
Absurd as it may seem now, until the mid-1990s, the Fed did not announce changes in its benchmark interest rate. It let the movement speak for itself.
Ms. Yellen and her colleagues have now concluded that transparency actually enhances the impact of the Fed's policies, particularly in the current circumstance. The Fed cannot push short-term rates below zero, but it still can reduce long-term rates, which are based on the expected level of short-term rates over the life of a loan, by persuading investors that those rates will remain near zero.
The Fed first experimented with this approach in 2003, when it announced that it would keep its benchmark rate at 1 percent for a ''considerable period.''
In recent years, since pushing rates nearly to zero in December 2008, the Fed has steadily elaborated on that idea. It promised to keep rates near zero for an ''extended period.'' Then it announced a series of specific timetables, most recently promising in September to hold rates near zero at least until mid-2015.
Mr. Bernanke said on Wednesday that he did not expect the change to an unemployment rate peg to have a significant short-term impact. The Fed still expects to start raising rates no earlier than the second half of 2015. For now, the central bank is simply clarifying its reasons.
But the change could have more important consequences in the future. Until now, when economic conditions changed, markets were left to wonder whether Fed policy would change, too. Now, if the pace of growth increases and unemployment falls more quickly, the Fed has already said that it will move to raise interest rates sooner. If the recovery once again falters and unemployment rises, the Fed has already said that it will continue to suppress rates.
Better yet, investors can respond immediately, an effect that Mr. Bernanke described on Wednesday as a kind of ''automatic stabilizer'' for the economy.
''If the outlook worsens and that leads markets to think that the increase in rates is further out in the future, that will tend to lower long-term rates and that will be supportive of the economy,'' he said. ''It kind of offsets adverse shocks.''
Analysts said the new policy also had some potential downsides, in particular because the unemployment rate is an imperfect measure of the health of the labor market. Last month, for example, the rate fell to 7.7 percent primarily because people stopped looking for work, not because they found new jobs.
The Fed said it would continue to consult other economic indicators, but Kris Dawsey, an economist at Goldman Sachs, noted that doing so would seem to undermine the benefits of announcing a specific economic objective.
''Under these circumstances the forward guidance would be considerably less clear than calendar-based guidance, as outside observers would have difficulty determining when this wide-ranging set of labor market indicators would cause the committee to believe that rate hikes should begin,'' he wrote.
A number of analysts including Mr. Dawsey also said that the new policy would give investors a new reason to fixate on the government's monthly release of employment data, potentially increasing market volatility.
And as the unemployment rate approaches 6.5 percent, investors may find themselves once again wondering what the Fed will do next.

HEADLINE: American Bull

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
London
WITH the United States running a huge deficit, the incomes of the ''99 percent'' stalled, the fiscal cliff approaching fast, the nation's dependence on external financing from China acute, and Washington gridlock a recurrent political condition, this may seem like an odd moment to be bullish on America. But I am.
The main reason is the huge shift already underway in the politics of energy and oil. The change has been underappreciated. It may be summed up in a single sentence buried in the 166-page study [pdf] just published by the U.S. National Intelligence Council: ''By 2020, the U.S. could emerge as a major energy exporter.'' 
That is just eight years away and, yes, you read that right, exporter of energy, not importer. According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the United States imports around 8 million barrels of crude oil a day, so the predicted turnabout is dramatic. With those imports, notably those from the Middle East, go forms of political dependency and expediency that have long exacted a price on the United States.
Several developments lie behind this looming geostrategic shift. The first is the advent of shale oil and natural gas production made possible by new technologies. The second is the increase in oil production from deep water offshore operations. Between them, by somewhere between 2020 and 2030, these new sources are expected almost to double U.S. domestic oil production, currently running at between six and seven million barrels a day.
Combine that with improved mileage for cars and a switch in trucking to cheap liquefied natural gas and a once unimaginable scenario becomes reality: The United States wipes out its need for oil imports. Eliminating need, of course, does not necessarily mean eliminating imports completely but it does mean a change in American leverage.
''This is a transformative development,'' Amy Myers Jaffe, the executive director of energy and sustainability at the University of California Davis, told me. ''We see ourselves increasingly as this weakened country dependent on faraway events. But as we become energy independent our sense of our own power and freedom of movement will change -- and with it our foreign policy in ways that are hard to predict. Oil is a different issue when it is not your own problem anymore.''
In other words, think of the world before the first oil shock of 1973 to get some notion of what is afoot.
In the Middle East, the equation switches when China becomes more dependent on a steady oil supply and more concerned on an economic basis about the region than the United States.
Right now, as Jaffe noted, China can operate in the knowledge that Middle Eastern instability costs the United States above all. If the Iran problem festers, for example, so be it. But facing a United States that is energy independent, as its own energy needs and costs rise, Beijing may well be prodded into a different strategic assessment.
Moreover, if oil prices fall over time, which seems plausible, the power and leverage of countries including Iran and Saudi Arabia will be diminished.
Several caveats are in order. First, shale oil and gas production depends on hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, whose environmental impact causes public unease. How far this will slow development is unclear.
Second, the power shift from the West toward the emergent powers of Asia over the next couple of decades is inexorable. So energy independence for the United States is not going to alter its need to operate in an interdependent world devoid of any hegemonic power. Third, countries including Saudi Arabia and Venezuela own large refining operations in the United States; oil ties with them are intricate and unlikely to unravel.
Still, the self-image and economic prospects of an energy independent United States are going to see a sharp uptick. As the National Intelligence Council's study says, ''The prospect of significantly lower energy prices will have significant positive ripple effects for the U.S. economy, encouraging companies to take advantage of lower energy prices to locate or relocate to the U.S.'' Already there are significant signs of the relocation of manufacturing industry to the United States, drawn in part by cheap energy. The council estimates as many as 3 million jobs added by 2030.
Jaffe, who recently moved from Texas to California, has noticed another important trend: the rapid coming-together of what she called ''App world and the energy world.'' This fusion is creating, through innovative technologies, tremendous possibilities in energy saving. Chevron, headquartered in California, has already developed a big energy efficiency business precisely through this symbiosis.
So, if you need consoling, look beyond the cliff a few years to an energy independent United States whose capacity for reinvention is far from exhausted. If that is not enough to lift the clouds, ponder demographic trends. The predicted median age in the United States in 2030 is 39 -- against 43 in China, 44 in Russia, 49 in Germany and 52 in Japan.
More people of working age using cheaper energy equals Advantage USA.

HEADLINE: S.&P. Puts Britain on Ratings Watch

BYLINE: By STEPHEN CASTLE

 BODY:
LONDON -- The likely loss of Britain's faultless sovereign credit rating assumed an air of inevitability Thursday when Standard & Poor's fell into line with its two main rivals and put the country on negative watch. 
The move came after the chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, announced last week that the government had missed one of its debt-cutting goals and would have to extend austerity policies into 2018, a year longer than previously promised.
Early in the financial crisis, Mr. Osborne highlighted Britain's triple-A credit rating as an endorsement of his economic policy. More recently he has played down its significance, apparently in anticipation of bad news.
Last week Mr. Osborne told the BBC that ''the credit rating is one of a number of ways in which people look at countries,'' adding that ''one of the things we've been able to do as a government is keep those rates very, very low because the world has confidence in us.''
In a statement Thursday, S.&P. said it now expected Britain's government debt as a percentage of gross domestic product to continue to rise in 2015 before declining again, adding, ''Future employment or growth shocks could pressure government finances further.''
''We are therefore revising our outlook on the unsolicited long-term ratings on the United Kingdom to negative, from stable, reflecting our view of a one-in-three chance that we could lower the ratings if the U.K.'s economic and fiscal performances weaken beyond our current expectations,'' the agency added.
The statement brought S.&P. into line with the two other big ratings agencies, Fitch and Moody's.
However, even if a downgrade should occur, the economic impact may not be significant or result in an increase in borrowing costs, judging by the experience of the United States and France, which have already lost their triple-A status.
''It's a lot about symbolism,'' said Robert Wood, chief economist for Britain at Berenberg Bank in London. ''It isn't the be-all and end-all, but what it does signify is the worsening outlook for Britain's public finances.''
''Markets move faster than rating agencies do and what S.&P. are doing is reacting to the Autumn Statement,'' Mr. Wood said, referring to Mr. Osborne's announcement last week. He added that his bank had thought for sometime that a downgrade was likely.
In a statement the Treasury said, ''In their assessment, Standard & Poor's endorse the government's 'strong commitment to implementing the fiscal mandate' and specifically warn against slowing 'the pace and extent of fiscal consolidation.' It is because we have stuck to that commitment that the deficit is down by a quarter and interest rates are at record lows.''

HEADLINE: Ideas on an Assembly Line

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
SCHENECTADY, N.Y. -- The Obama administration has long heralded the potential of American factories to offer good, stable middle-class jobs in an economy that desperately needs them. But experts say there might be another advantage to expanding manufacturing in the United States: a more innovative economy.
A growing chorus of economists, engineers and business leaders are warning that the evisceration of the manufacturing work force over the last 30 years might not have scarred just Detroit and the Rust Belt. It might have dimmed the country's capacity to innovate and stunted the prospects for long-term growth.
''In sector after sector, we've lost our innovation edge because we don't produce goods here anymore,'' said Mitzi Montoya, dean of the college of technology and innovation at Arizona State University. 
These experts say that in industries that produce complex, high-technology products -- things like bioengineered tissues, not light bulbs -- companies that keep their research and manufacturing employees close together might be more innovative than businesses that develop a schematic and send it overseas for low-wage workers to make. Moreover, clusters of manufacturers, where workers and ideas can naturally flow between companies, might prove more productive and innovative than the same businesses if they were spread across the country.
A General Electric facility in upstate New York provides a test case. In a custom-built facility the size of four football fields, workers are casting into thin tubes a kind of ceramic that G.E. invented. Those tubes get filled with a secret chemical ''brownie mix,'' packaged into batteries and shipped across the world.
The plant sits just a few miles down the road from the research campus where G.E. scientists developed the technology. That allows them to work out kinks on the assembly line, and test prototypes of and uses for the battery, the company's scientists said.
''We're not thinking about just one generation,'' said Glen Merfeld of G.E.'s chemical energy systems laboratory, showing off a test battery his employees had run into exhaustion. ''We're working on the second, the third, the fourth, the fifth.''
The idea is to knit together manufacturing, design, prototyping and production, said Michael Idelchik, vice president for advanced technologies, who holds a dozen patents himself. ''We believe that rather than a sequential process where you look at product design and then how to manufacture it, there is a simultaneous process,'' Mr. Idelchik said. ''We think it is key for sustaining our long-term competitive advantage.''
Economists and policy experts are now researching whether such strategies offer the same benefits for other businesses -- and examining how those benefits might show up in national data on innovation, productivity and growth.
At the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Suzanne Berger has helped to start the Production in the Innovation Economy project to study the subject. ''It is something that's very difficult to establish systematically,'' said Professor Berger. ''You really have to be willing to look at case-by-case evidence, qualitative evidence. That's what we're trying to do.''
Thus far, she said, the anecdotal evidence from about 200 companies has proved striking, with company after company detailing the advantages of keeping makers and thinkers together. That does not mean every business, she stressed. Companies with products early in their life cycle seemed to benefit more than ones with products on the market for years. So did companies making especially complicated or advanced goods, from new medicines to new machines.
''It's the companies where the challenge of producing on a commercial scale requires levels of scientific activity that are just as complex as the original challenge of developing the technology,'' Professor Berger said.
Economists said that while the link between making and innovating within individual businesses was not yet well established, the link between making and innovating between different companies was.
It is what they call a ''spillover'' effect: manufacturing companies near one another create a kind of commons. Workers exchange ideas over drinks and at baseball games. They switch jobs, taking their knowledge with them. They draw other companies, who compete to offer them goods and services. It all adds up to a more productive, more innovative economy.
For instance, the economist Michael Greenstone of M.I.T. analyzed what happened to towns after marquee manufacturing plants, like a BMW factory, moved in. Other factories in the town became more productive, he and his co-authors found. Wages rose, too. Such evidence has left many economists and other experts concerned about the overseas movement of manufacturing jobs and facilities over the past 30 years.
The bulk of those jobs, experts were keen to note, were jobs that the United States probably would not want back -- like repetitive assembly positions. But many were more cerebral positions, where manufacturing workers were not simply following a schematic, but solving problems.
''Outsourcing has not stopped with low-value tasks like simple assembly or circuit-board stuffing,'' wrote Willy C. Shih and Gary P. Pisano of Harvard Business School. ''Sophisticated engineering and manufacturing capabilities that underpin innovation in a wide range of products have been rapidly leaving, too.''
That might have left the United States falling behind in some fast-growing areas of cutting-edge technology, like bioscience and nanotechnology.
''The manufacturing process itself is going through an innovation revolution,'' said Stephen Hoover, chief executive of Xerox PARC. ''It's not four million people on an assembly line. It's a small number of really highly skilled people.''
The White House has studied these arguments and evidence, and found itself convinced.
''A vibrant manufacturing sector is inextricably linked to our capacity as a nation to innovate,'' concludes a White House report published this year. It has pushed for allocating billions of dollars to an array of policies to bring back manufacturing and keep it in the United States.
Experts and executives for manufacturing companies described the proposals as helpful, but too small to make a significant difference. When asked what might help rebuild the country's manufacturing commons faster, they mentioned things like a larger immigration program for science, engineering and technology graduates; tripling government investment in basic research and development; hugely increasing export financing; and changing the country's regulatory scheme.
''Other nations are competing intensely to create an attractive business and regulatory environment for manufacturing firms'' said James Manyika, director of the McKinsey Global Institute, which recently published a report on manufacturing's link with innovation. ''The United States just hasn't done this as aggressively as other countries have.''

HEADLINE: The G.O.P.'s Existential Crisis

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
David Brooks is off today.

 BODY:
We are not having a debt crisis.
It's important to make this point, because I keep seeing articles about the ''fiscal cliff'' that do, in fact, describe it -- often in the headline -- as a debt crisis. But it isn't. The U.S. government is having no trouble borrowing to cover its deficit. In fact, its borrowing costs are near historic lows. And even the confrontation over the debt ceiling that looms a few months from now if we do somehow manage to avoid going over the fiscal cliff isn't really about debt.
No, what we're having is a political crisis, born of the fact that one of our two great political parties has reached the end of a 30-year road. The modern Republican Party's grand, radical agenda lies in ruins -- but the party doesn't know how to deal with that failure, and it retains enough power to do immense damage as it strikes out in frustration. 
Before I talk about that reality, a word about the current state of budget ''negotiations.''
Why the scare quotes? Because these aren't normal negotiations in which each side presents specific proposals, and horse-trading proceeds until the two sides converge. By all accounts, Republicans have, so far, offered almost no specifics. They claim that they're willing to raise $800 billion in revenue by closing loopholes, but they refuse to specify which loopholes they would close; they are demanding large cuts in spending, but the specific cuts they have been willing to lay out wouldn't come close to delivering the savings they demand.
It's a very peculiar situation. In effect, Republicans are saying to President Obama, ''Come up with something that will make us happy.'' He is, understandably, not willing to play that game. And so the talks are stuck.
Why won't the Republicans get specific? Because they don't know how. The truth is that, when it comes to spending, they've been faking it all along -- not just in this election, but for decades. Which brings me to the nature of the current G.O.P. crisis.
Since the 1970s, the Republican Party has fallen increasingly under the influence of radical ideologues, whose goal is nothing less than the elimination of the welfare state -- that is, the whole legacy of the New Deal and the Great Society. From the beginning, however, these ideologues have had a big problem: The programs they want to kill are very popular. Americans may nod their heads when you attack big government in the abstract, but they strongly support Social Security, Medicare, and even Medicaid. So what's a radical to do?
The answer, for a long time, has involved two strategies. One is ''starve the beast,'' the idea of using tax cuts to reduce government revenue, then using the resulting lack of funds to force cuts in popular social programs. Whenever you see some Republican politician piously denouncing federal red ink, always remember that, for decades, the G.O.P. has seen budget deficits as a feature, not a bug.
Arguably more important in conservative thinking, however, was the notion that the G.O.P. could exploit other sources of strength -- white resentment, working-class dislike of social change, tough talk on national security -- to build overwhelming political dominance, at which point the dismantling of the welfare state could proceed freely. Just eight years ago, Grover Norquist, the antitax activist, looked forward cheerfully to the days when Democrats would be politically neutered: ''Any farmer will tell you that certain animals run around and are unpleasant, but when they've been fixed, then they are happy and sedate.''
O.K., you see the problem: Democrats didn't go along with the program, and refused to give up. Worse, from the Republican point of view, all of their party's sources of strength have turned into weaknesses. Democratic dominance among Hispanics has overshadowed Republican dominance among southern whites; women's rights have trumped the politics of abortion and antigay sentiment; and guess who finally did get Osama bin Laden.
And look at where we are now in terms of the welfare state: far from killing it, Republicans now have to watch as Mr. Obama implements the biggest expansion of social insurance since the creation of Medicare.
So Republicans have suffered more than an election defeat, they've seen the collapse of a decades-long project. And with their grandiose goals now out of reach, they literally have no idea what they want -- hence their inability to make specific demands.
It's a dangerous situation. The G.O.P. is lost and rudderless, bitter and angry, but it still controls the House and, therefore, retains the ability to do a lot of harm, as it lashes out in the death throes of the conservative dream.
Our best hope is that business interests will use their influence to limit the damage. But the odds are that the next few years will be very, very ugly.

HEADLINE: S.&P. Streak Comes to an End on Fiscal Worries

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended its six-day winning streak Thursday, retreating as worries intensified that Washington's fiscal negotiations were dragging on with little progress.
Anxiety about the talks between Democrats and Republicans was enough to offset encouraging data on retail sales and jobless claims.
Investors are concerned that tax increases and spending cuts, set to begin in 2013 if a deal is not reached in Washington, will hurt growth. The stock market had taken the heated talk in stride lately, but downbeat remarks from the House speaker, John A. Boehner of Ohio, prompted some selling Thursday. 
Mr. Boehner accused President Obama of ''slow walking'' the economy toward the automatic tax increases and spending cuts that will occur on Jan. 1, 2013, if no deal is reached. He was scheduled to meet with Mr. Obama later on Thursday.
''There is no conviction here and Boehner's comments -- as harsh as they were -- were realistic,'' said Jason Weisberg, managing director at the Seaport Securities Corporation in New York.
''The fiscal cliff is already built in,'' Mr. Weisberg said. ''That being said, people don't like to be told the apocalypse is coming over and over and over again. The real players in this market have already closed their books.''
After nearing a 1 percent decline for the day, the S.& P. 500 pared losses late in the session. The index had posted six consecutive sessions of gains through Wednesday, and at one point Wednesday, the S.& P. 500 touched its highest intraday level since Oct. 22.
While the Federal Reserve's announcement on Wednesday of a new round of economic stimulus bolstered stocks, Chairman Ben Bernanke's comments that monetary policy would not be sufficient to offset the impact of the fiscal crisis weighed on sentiment.
The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 74.73 points, or 0.56 percent, to 13,170.72 at the close. The S.& P. 500-stock index fell 9.03 points, or 0.63 percent, to 1,419.45. The Nasdaq composite index slid 21.65 points, or 0.72 percent, to end at 2,992.16.
Apple's stock, down 1.7 percent at $529.69, was among the biggest drags on the Nasdaq, while I.B.M., down 0.5 percent at $191.99, was among the biggest weights on the Dow. A federal jury in Delaware Thursday found that Apple's iPhone infringed on three patents owned by MobileMedia Ideas.
Among the day's biggest gainers, Best Buy shares shot up 15.9 percent to $14.12 after a report that the company's founder, Richard M. Schulze, was expected to offer to buy the consumer electronics retailer this week.
The energy and information technology sectors were the S.& P.'s weakest performers, with the S.& P. energy index declining 0.9 percent. Shares of the American refining company Phillips 66 lost 1.6 percent to $52.21.
The day's data sent some positive signals on the economy, with weekly claims for jobless benefits dropping to nearly the lowest level since February 2008, and retail sales rising in November after an October decline, improving the picture for consumer spending.
In Europe, European Union finance ministers reached agreement to make the European Central Bank the bloc's top banking supervisor, which could increase confidence in the ability of European Union leaders to confront the euro zone's sovereign debt crisis.
The Treasury's 10 year note fell 9/32 to 99 1/32, with the yield rising to 1.73 from 1.70 on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Moody's Downgrade Deepens Puerto Rico's Economic Problems

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
Moody's Investors Service downgraded the debt of Puerto Rico to just above junk status on Thursday, putting pressure on the governor-elect, Alejandro García-Padilla, to show credible plans for staving off a crisis. 
Although Puerto Rico's economic difficulties are no secret to investors, its debt is widely held, thanks to its unusual exemption from all federal, state and local income taxes across the United States. If the commonwealth's creditworthiness were to fall below investment grade, some institutional investors would be required to sell their holdings.
A downgrade would also make it more expensive for Puerto Rico to raise money, something it has had to do every year to finance government operations.
Moody's said in its report that its outlook for Puerto Rico remained negative. It cited concern about Puerto Rico's high level of indebtedness and its shrinking population. Moody's also expressed concern about the island's pension system for government workers, which is considered one of the weakest in the United States.
The downgrade to Baa3 puts Moody's assessment of Puerto Rico a notch below that of Standard & Poor's. Shortly after November's election, S.&. P. issued a statement that there was a one-in-three chance it would downgrade Puerto Rico by early 2013.

HEADLINE: In the Fiscal Debate, An Unvarnished Voice For Shielding Benefits

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When President Obama cut a deal with Congressional Republicans in December 2010 to extend tax cuts for the wealthy, Senator Bernard Sanders, the brusque Vermont independent who calls himself a socialist, decided it was time for a protest.
He had a cup of coffee and a bowl of oatmeal in a Senate cafeteria, marched into the chamber and began talking. He talked for so long -- railing for 8 hours 37 minutes about economic justice, the decline of the middle class and ''reckless, uncontrollable'' corporate greed -- that his legs cramped. So many people watched online that the Senate video server crashed.
Today the issue of tax cuts for the wealthy is once again front and center in Washington, as part of the debate over how to reduce the federal deficit. And Mr. Sanders is once again talking, carving out a place for himself as the antithesis of the Tea Party and becoming a thorn in the side to some Democrats and Mr. Obama, who he fears will cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid benefits as part of a deficit reduction deal.
A number of Congressional Democrats agree with Mr. Sanders that ''no deal is better than a bad deal,'' but he may be the most vocal. 
He is emboldened by his recent re-election with more than 70 percent of the vote -- ''Seventy-one percent, but who's counting?'' Mr. Sanders said -- and he appears to be making a little headway. Mr. Sanders has been pressing Mr. Obama to take Social Security off the negotiating table, and the White House now says changes to the retirement program should be considered on a ''separate track'' from a deficit deal.
''I think maybe he has learned something,'' Mr. Sanders, 71, said of the president, who is 20 years his junior. ''After four years he has gotten the clue that you can't negotiate with yourself, you can't come up with a modest agreement and hope the Republicans say, 'That's fair, you're O.K., we'll accept that.' He's reached out his hand, and they've cut him off at the wrist.''
The Senate is a polite place, so Republicans have little to say about their colleague from Vermont with the thick Brooklyn accent. (He acquired it growing up in Flatbush.) After four years of accusing Mr. Obama of practicing ''European-style socialism,'' they are hardly enamored of a man who actually embraces European-style socialism, and who carries a brass key chain from the presidential campaign of Eugene V. Debs, who ran in the early 1900s as the Socialist Party candidate.
''Bernie?'' Senator John Cornyn, the Texas Republican, said with a raised eyebrow and a sly smile. ''He's one of a kind.''
Vermont Republicans are a bit more pointed. Richard Tarrant, a businessman who ran against Mr. Sanders in 2006 and was trounced, agrees with him that taxes should rise for the rich. But he sees his former opponent as a populist ''advocating class warfare'' and raising ''false hope'' about programs that are unsustainable.
Mr. Sanders, who has a habit of answering questions with questions, says it is Republicans who are engaging in class warfare.
''Do we really say we're going to balance the budget on making major cuts in disability benefits for veterans who have lost their arms and legs defending America, while we continue to give tax breaks to billionaires?'' he thundered, without pausing for breath. ''Is that what the American people want? They surely do not, and only within a Beltway surrounded by Wall Street and big-money interests could anyone think that is vaguely sensible.''
Mr. Sanders, who on Wednesday was appointed chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, has 28 of the Senate's 51 Democrats with him on keeping Social Security out of the deficit talks; all signed a letter that he and the Senate Democratic leader, Harry Reid, sent to the president. In the House, 104 Democrats -- more than half of the caucus -- signed a similar appeal. And 13 Senate Democrats, plus Mr. Sanders, signed a second letter demanding that entitlement programs be spared ''harmful cuts.''
To Mr. Sanders, ''harmful cuts'' means any cuts in benefits. He says that entitlement spending should be trimmed only by wringing out inefficiencies. Many budget experts say that is unlikely to produce as much savings as the president and Republicans want. But Senator Tom Harkin, the Iowa Democrat, believes that Mr. Sanders has some silent support.
''I think Senator Sanders represents the majority of our caucus,'' Mr. Harkin said. ''Not all of it, but the majority. They may not be saying it in the same way that Sanders says it, not as aggressively as Senator Sanders. But I think that's where they are.''
With his gruff exterior and utter lack of interest in the false pleasantries of politics, Mr. Sanders, a onetime college radical who led a sit-in in 1962 at the University of Chicago to protest discriminatory housing policies, is an unlikely figure to have gained admittance to the Senate, often called the world's most exclusive club.
Before becoming successful in politics, he knocked around from job to job -- carpenter, tax clerk, freelance writer. He took his first trip to Vermont in the mid-1960s after picking up a tourist brochure at Rockefeller Center. He and his wife at the time bought 85 acres of woodlands for $2,500 and began spending long summers in a ''sugar cabin'' -- a shack where maple syrup is made -- without electricity or indoor plumbing. In 1968, they moved permanently.
In 1971, he ran for the Senate in a special election on an antiwar platform and got 2 percent of the vote. Ten years later, he squeaked past a six-term Democratic incumbent to become the mayor of Burlington, winning by 10 votes. In a small state like Vermont (population 626,000), Mr. Sanders has proved to be a master of retail politics. This year, he held dozens of town meetings and won without running a single television advertisement.
''Bernie engages everyone,'' said Garrison Nelson, a political scientist at the University of Vermont. ''He walks the streets of Burlington alone, without an entourage. People will come up to him and say, 'You lousy communist S.O.B.,' and he'll say: 'What do you mean? Clarify yourself.' ''
If Mr. Sanders could have his way, the United States would be like Finland or Sweden, where the government guarantees child care and health care. His philosophy flows from his Brooklyn boyhood; he grew up the son of a paint salesman in a home, he said, where ''money was always a source of friction.''
The family lived in a one-bedroom apartment; the young Mr. Sanders slept in the living room with his older brother. His mother, who died at 46, dreamed of owning a ''private house.'' His father, a Polish immigrant, reminded him of Willy Loman, the hard-working character in ''Death of a Salesman,'' who is fired after 34 years with the same company.
The play offers a lesson that the senator says is too often forgotten in Washington, ''of people who have money not understanding what it's like not to have money.'' Mr. Sanders intends to make people understand, and if he thinks it is necessary to stand on the Senate floor for another 8 hours 37 minutes, he just might do it.

HEADLINE: Hurricane Sandy's Effects Leave Some Municipal Workers as Refugees, Too

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN

 BODY:
City welfare workers with flashlights strapped to their heads are trudging up as many as 25 flights of stairs to dark, chilly offices to retrieve computers, Medicaid checks and, if time allows, a child's art project.
Municipal employees responsible for assisting candidates in next year's election are relying on borrowed laptops and squeezing into a work space that, with its resemblance to economy-class airline seating, has been christened ''The Row.''
Administrative law judges, whose black robes and digital recording equipment remain quarantined in another building, are conducting hearings in shrunken, windowless rooms, using Panasonic cassette recorders that may have been cutting-edge equipment during the Koch administration. 
Weeks after Hurricane Sandy ripped through New York City, some 6,000 city workers from eight agencies remain displaced from offices that were rendered unusable because of flood damage or electrical problems.
What started out as an emergency evacuation has become a semipermanent state of dislocation. And virtually everything those workers left behind on the eve of the storm has stayed behind: invoices, business cards, ergonomic equipment, shoes, snacks, plants, mementos.
''It's interesting to learn what you can do without,'' said Eric Friedman, director of external affairs for the Campaign Finance Board, whose offices at 40 Rector Street are two months away (fingers crossed) from reopening.
Visual clues of a makeshift environment abound. At 66 John Street, judges in the Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings, or OATH, who are also refugees from 40 Rector Street, hold hearings on everything from car seizures to Civil Service disciplinary cases in unadorned offices identified by handwritten notes taped to the doors reading, ''Temporary -- OATH.''
The Campaign Finance Board has affixed countless Post-it notes with instructions on the walls of its temporary offices at 250 Broadway, home to the New York City Housing Authority. The wireless signal is ''NYCHA_Guest.'' On one wall, two adjoining notes, in different handwriting, play off each other -- ''Not a Door'' and ''Or is it?''
Work conditions can be challenging. Employees of a single agency are scattered all over the city, so face-to-face meetings can be logistically difficult. Many phones do not work. Some employees are sharing laptops, or using older models normally reserved for training sessions. Meetings sometimes spill into hallways, because there is not enough space for employees, many of whom must drag folding chairs into whatever closet or junior office is free.
But employees are also adapting. Marisa L. Senigo, an assistant commissioner at OATH, was unable to return to her apartment or her office, both in Lower Manhattan, for weeks, so she removed some hanging folders from a file cabinet in her temporary office and stuffed in some work clothes, plus a pair of sweat pants, just in case.
''I was living out of a file drawer,'' Ms. Senigo said, showing a reporter some blouses, sweaters and perfume.
The city requires employees to work at their offices, unlike some private companies, which allow employees to work from home. Some city workers have been reporting to ''sites that were in less-than-optimum condition in order to provide services to people who desperately needed them,'' said Lee Clarke, director of health and safety for District Council 37, the largest union representing municipal workers.
Still, Robert Doar, commissioner of the Human Resources Administration, whose main office, at 180 Water Street, may be closed for several months, said that the tight quarters had ''engendered an even greater sense of teamwork.''
Employees are slowly returning to their own offices as buildings are repaired under the aegis of the Department of Citywide Administrative Services, which has been responsible for shuffling employees between temporary and permanent spaces.
Last week, 1,100 employees of the Department of Transportation, about one-quarter of the agency's staff, returned to 55 Water Street.
Never mind that only half the elevators were functioning. Or that there was a whiff of fuel or
oil in the corridors. Or that the neighborhood smelled like a moldy rag, and sounded like a giant hair dryer, thanks to the plethora of generators outside.
''People were hugging each other, and it did have the feel of a family reunion,'' Janette Sadik-Khan, the transportation commissioner, recalled. ''It was also like a series of flashbacks, looking at all the stuff you were working on a month ago, and realizing how much has changed since then.''
Every once in a while, a few employees, accompanied by security guards, are authorized to retrieve the most essential items from offices still off-limits.
The Human Resources Administration discovered after the storm that its safes had flooded, and that possibly millions of dollars' worth of state Medicaid checks, MetroCards and letters were floating in water. So employees aired out the materials they could salvage, destroyed the ones they could not, and signed hundreds of checks manually, because automated printers were not available.
Last week, Jean G. Nau, director of the agency's bureau of claims and reimbursements, and Jill Berry, an executive deputy commissioner, climbed nine frigid stories to retrieve two state-issued computers that must be used to process Medicaid claims for 2,000 city residents -- ''or else their coverage is at risk,'' Ms. Berry said, unplugging the computers and placing them in large plastic shopping bags.
Employees of the Campaign Finance Board were more fortunate: at 40 Rector, one elevator now works, thanks to a generator, so several employees returned last week to retrieve computer mice, surge protectors and other equipment.
''It's budget season,'' said Shauna Tarshis Denkensohn, director of operations and budget, packing up a thesaurus, calculator and family photo. ''You have to get your files.''
As she pivoted around the office, surrounded by clocks still set to daylight saving time, she noticed something orange on her desk. ''Would you like some candy? It's from Halloween. It's probably stale.''

HEADLINE: Building a Showcase Campus, Using an I.O.U.

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
Some call it the Edifice Complex. Others have named it the Law of More, or the Taj Mahal syndrome.
A decade-long spending binge to build academic buildings, dormitories and recreational facilities -- some of them inordinately lavish to attract students -- has left colleges and universities saddled with large amounts of debt. Oftentimes, students are stuck picking up the bill.
Overall debt levels more than doubled from 2000 to 2011 at the more than 500 institutions rated by Moody's, according to inflation-adjusted data compiled for The New York Times by the credit rating agency. In the same time, the amount of cash, pledged gifts and investments that colleges maintain declined more than 40 percent relative to the amount they owe.
With revenue pinched at institutions big and small, financial experts and college officials are sounding alarms about the consequences of the spending and borrowing. Last month, Harvard University officials warned of ''rapid, disorienting change'' at colleges and universities. 
''The need for change in higher education is clear given the emerging disconnect between ever-increasing aspirations and universities' ability to generate the new resources to finance them,'' said an unusually sobering introduction to Harvard's annual report for the fiscal year ended in June.
The debate about indebtedness has focused on students and graduates who have borrowed tens of thousands of dollars and are struggling to keep up with their payments. Nearly one in every six borrowers with a student loan balance is in default.
But some colleges and universities have also borrowed heavily, spending money on vast expansions and amenities aimed at luring better students: student unions with movie theaters and wine bars; workout facilities with climbing walls and ''lazy rivers''; and dormitories with single rooms and private baths. Spending on instruction has grown at a much slower pace, studies have shown. Students end up covering some, if not most, of the debt payments in the form of higher tuition, room and board and special assessments, while in some instances state taxpayers pick up the costs.
Debt has ballooned at colleges across the board -- public and private, elite and obscure. While Harvard is the wealthiest university in the country, it also has $6 billion in debt, the most of any private college, the data compiled by Moody's shows.
At the Juilliard School, which completed a major renovation a few years ago, debt climbed to $195 million last year, from $6 million in inflation-adjusted dollars in 2002. At Miami University, a public institution in Ohio that is overhauling its dormitories and student union, debt rose to $326 million in 2011, from $66 million in 2002, and at New York University, which has embarked on an ambitious expansion, debt was $2.8 billion in 2011, up from $1.2 billion in 2002, according to the Moody's data.
The pile of debt -- $205 billion outstanding in 2011 at the colleges rated by Moody's -- comes at a time of increasing uncertainty in academia. After years of robust growth, enrollment is flat or declining at many institutions, particularly in the Northeast and Midwest. With outstanding student debt exceeding $1 trillion, students and their parents are questioning the cost and value of college. And online courses threaten to upend the traditional collegiate experience and payment model.
At the same time, the financial crisis and recession created a new and sometimes harrowing financial calculus. Traditional sources of revenue like tuition, state appropriations and endowment returns continue to be squeezed, even as the costs of labor, health care for employees, technology and interest on debt have generally increased.
Students are requiring more and more financial aid, a trend that many believe is unsustainable for all but the wealthiest institutions.
''We've had a lot more downgrades than upgrades in the last five years,'' said John C. Nelson, managing director of the higher education and health care practice at Moody's, which has a negative outlook on all but the top state universities and private schools. ''There is going to be a thinning out of the ranks.''
For now, the worst financial struggles are confined to stand-alone professional schools and small, tuition-dependent private colleges. For instance, $63 million in debt has left Mount St. Mary's University, a small Roman Catholic college in Maryland, with thin financial resources and junk-rated credit, according to a Moody's rating in March.
''We borrowed a lot of money, but we had no choice,'' said Thomas H. Powell, the university's president, who maintains, despite the credit rating, that it has regained its footing and has no need for additional debt. ''I wasn't going to watch the buildings fall down.''
Almost no one is predicting colleges will experience default rates on par with those of indebted students and graduates, at least not anytime soon. While payments on debt principal and interest have increased over all, they remain a manageable piece of the expense pie for most institutions, partly because of historically low interest rates, financial analysts said.
Still, higher debt payments and other expenses have contributed to the runaway inflation of college costs, and the impact on students is real and often substantial. New financial realities on campuses are imposing conflicting demands on college administrators: do they make their institution more affordable, or continue to spend money to make their campus more attractive?
Despite a lull in construction after the financial crisis, borrowing has continued to grow, Moody's data shows. ''Schools are behaving like the Greeks, irresponsibly,'' said Richard K. Vedder, an economics professor at Ohio University and director of the Center for College Affordability and Productivity. As an example, he cited his own employer, Ohio University, which has proposed spending $2.6 billion on construction projects in the next 20 years, half of it paid for by debt -- an undertaking university officials said was necessary to update antiquated buildings.
''The Edifice Complex pervading higher education flies in the face of other trends that call for caution in capital spending,'' Dr. Vedder said in an e-mail.
The Law of More
Administrators at Ramapo College of New Jersey, a public institution founded in 1969, have harbored a dream of making it the premier public liberal arts college in the New York metropolitan area.
But one big obstacle has been the state of New Jersey, which has provided little money for capital projects on state colleges and universities in the last two decades.
So Ramapo borrowed, and it borrowed some more, building a new business school, dormitories and a recreational facility that includes a 2,200-seat arena. A new wing that will house the nursing program is under construction.
Ramapo now has $281 million in debt, and its debt payments account for 13 percent of its budget, high compared with most colleges rated by Moody's.
While the proportion of debt payments to budget at Ramapo is unusual, its story is not.
Amid increasingly intense competition for better students and higher rankings, college administrators across the country during the last decade have deployed a relatively simple strategy borrowed from the movies: if you build it, they will come.
Construction starts on college campuses were 32.6 million square feet in 2008, the highest in two decades and up from 12.1 million square feet in 1990, according to a 2010 study by McGraw-Hill Construction. Construction declined after the financial crisis but is beginning to recover, McGraw-Hill officials said.
The building was often done with borrowed money. Outstanding debt at the 224 public universities rated by Moody's grew to $122 billion in 2011, from $53 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars in 2000. At the 281 private universities rated by Moody's, debt increased to $83 billion, from $40 billion, in that period. Rather than deplete their endowments, some colleges borrowed to help pay bills after the financial crisis, but most borrowing was for capital projects.
Since 2000, the amount paid in interest and principal has increased 67 percent at public institutions, to $9.3 billion in 2011, and it increased 62 percent at private ones, to $5 billion last year. Mr. Nelson at Moody's said the increase was a result not only of increased borrowing but also, in recent years, of a shift from variable- to fixed-rate debt, which typically increases interest costs but is more stable.
A study released in July by Bain & Company and Sterling Partners, a private equity firm, found that long-term debt at the nation's nonprofit colleges and universities grew 12 percent a year from 2002 to 2008, while interest costs increased 9 percent.
By comparison, the cost of instruction grew 5 percent in that time period. The Bain report estimates that a third of colleges and universities are financially weaker than they were a few years ago.
''Much of the liquidity crisis facing higher education comes from having succumbed to the 'Law of More,' '' the Bain report said. ''Many institutions have operated on the assumption that the more they build, spend, diversify and expand, the more they will persist and prosper. But instead, the opposite has happened: institutions have become overleveraged.''
Not all borrowing, even an eye-popping amount, is necessarily bad if you are an administrator at the University of Cincinnati, a state university with $1.1 billion in debt.
''The institution has profited mightily from the changes that we have made,'' said Mitchel D. Livingston, vice president for student affairs. He noted that enrollment had increased and that the quality of the student body had improved, as had the ''quality of life experience on campus.''
''We have gone from a second-choice institution to a first-choice,'' he said.
Daniel M. Fogel, who resigned last year as president of the University of Vermont, said that given the lack of state support, many public colleges and universities had to borrow money just to remain adequate. He said that when he arrived at the university in 2002, some of the laboratories were inferior to those at many high schools.
''How do you bring people to teaching facilities that are really subpar?'' he said. ''It's not a matter of gilding the lily, in many cases.''
Other schools also stood by their borrowing. John Beckman, an N.Y.U. spokesman, said nearly $900 million of the university's debt was for its hospital and therefore had no impact on students. He said that N.Y.U.'s revenue increased 100 percent in the last decade, so that while debt also increased, the proportion of interest and principal paid against the overall budget has remained relatively steady.
A Juilliard spokeswoman said that the renovations were needed to update and expand facilities, and that a fund-raising drive would help defray some of the costs.
Picking Up the Bill
David K. Creamer, vice president for finance and business services at Miami University, said the importance of college rankings had pressured administrators to spend more and more. In some rankings, the effect of spending is direct because institutions with ''the best dorms'' or ''the best athletic facilities'' are singled out. The effect on other rankings is indirect: better facilities attract better students, and that ultimately raises rankings, Mr. Creamer said.
''There is nothing in there that says if you become more efficient, your ratings will go up. They will probably go down,'' he said.
Miami borrowed money to renovate antiquated dorms and a student union, but Mr. Creamer warned that colleges cannot indefinitely spend their way to the top. ''It's not a sustainable approach,'' he said. Miami's debt increased this year to $444 million, a 36 percent increase from last year.
One problem is that the spending can make college prohibitively expensive. In some states, including New York, California and Connecticut, borrowing for public colleges and universities is mostly paid for by taxpayers, so students are not directly responsible for payments on the debt. But at most colleges, there is little question that construction and increased borrowing have contributed to escalating costs and student debt.
Often, though, the costs are not easy to isolate.
With some exceptions, interest and principal payments are paid with general revenue, which includes tuition, room and board, a portion of endowment returns and state appropriations. At smaller colleges that are dependent on tuition for most of their revenue, students shoulder a bigger burden of the debt. (Conversely, at wealthy universities with multiple revenue streams, students may pay very little of the debt.)
Some debt at public universities is paid by specific charges approved by students, for things like new student unions or recreational facilities, and in other instances, colleges have added a specific fee for construction projects and repairs.
At Ramapo College in New Jersey, administrators in 2009 added a capital improvement fee, now $1,000 a year, to pay for repairs. Other public colleges in New Jersey had already imposed similar fees on students.
It costs about $24,500 for New Jersey residents to attend Ramapo and live on campus (excluding books and personal expenses), roughly 30 percent more than a decade ago.
Ramapo's president, Peter P. Mercer, said debt had definitely added to the costs for students. But he said Ramapo's options were limited given the lack of state funding and other financial resources. Since the college is only 43 years old, it has a relatively small endowment and alumni support.
''If Ramapo College was going to respond to what students wanted, which was larger, more comprehensive programs and residential housing, then we were going to have to go out and borrow,'' Mr. Mercer said.
Scaling Back
Harvard may not have to spend lavish sums of money to attract students. But it has spent billions anyway, to maintain and even bolster its position atop the academic heap.
In the six years leading up to the financial crisis, financed by robust endowment returns and debt, Harvard added 200 faculty members (a 10 percent increase) and more than four million gross square feet of buildings (a 20 percent increase). Its grant aid to students grew 80 percent in those years.
But the financial crisis and recession forced a sharp correction. The university's endowment, whose annual returns provided roughly a third of the operating budget, suffered a 27 percent negative return in fiscal 2009, an $11 billion loss, and Harvard borrowed $1.5 billion to pay its bills rather than selling off assets at a sharp discount. Its interest expense more than doubled from fiscal 2008 to fiscal 2011, to nearly $300 million.
''The financial crisis has acted like a tidal wave that, as it receded, exposed certain vulnerabilities with a new clarity,'' Harvard officials said in the November annual report.
That tidal wave struck a broad swath of higher education, forcing university presidents across the country to look at spending, and debt, in a new light.
At Drexel University, a private college in Philadelphia, an ambitious expansion by a previous president, Constantine Papadakis, who died in 2009, transformed it from a 9,000-student university on the brink of bankruptcy 17 years ago to a modern campus with 21,000 students and a spot on U.S. News and World Report's ''up and coming'' schools list. But the change has come with a price: $467 million in debt and a net price of attendance that is among the highest in the nation.
Mr. Papadakis's successor as president, John A. Fry, plans to continue that expansion, but without taking on additional debt anytime soon.
Rather, he hopes to ''use other people's money'' to expand the university by leasing Drexel's land for privately developed projects. Already, developers are building one dormitory on Drexel property, and there are plans for another. Mr. Fry also agreed last year to a merger with Philadelphia's Academy of Natural Sciences, as a way to bolster both the museum and Drexel's natural sciences department.
''Holding on to the old ways, I don't think that is going to work,'' Mr. Fry said. ''I think the public is tired of that.''
At the Ohio State University, President E. Gordon Gee declared the era of ''Taj Mahal-like'' dormitories and academic buildings over.
''There is no one who likes to build more than me,'' said Mr. Gee, who took over at Ohio State in 2007 and is the highest paid president of any public college. Debt has grown roughly 70 percent since then, to $2 billion. ''The reality is, that is what got us in trouble.''
At Ramapo, President Mercer said he planned to focus on marketing the college's academic reputation, rather than its new buildings. Students, he said, seem less interested in ''bells and whistles'' now that the costs of college -- and the potential debt -- have become painfully clear.
''I think the attitude has changed,'' he said. ''Five years ago, I might have been asked if they had to share a bathroom. Now, I'm asked if my business school is accredited.''

HEADLINE: As State Budgets Rebound, Federal Cuts Could Pose Danger

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
After years of budget cuts and sluggish recovery, states expect to see their revenues climb back to prerecession levels this year for the first time since the financial crisis hit. But even as some states hope to restore some of the deep spending cuts they have made, they face a new threat.
Washington's efforts to tame the federal deficit, state officials fear, could end up further whittling away the federal aid that states depend upon and weakening the economy as it slowly mends. 
Those worries cloud a year that should be a turning point of sorts for the states. A fiscal survey of states released Friday by the National Governors Association and the National Association of State Budget Officers found that states expect to collect $692.8 billion in general fund revenues this fiscal year, which is more than they collected in 2008, the last fiscal year before the recession.
That is good news, but perhaps not as good as it initially appears. Adjusted for inflation, this year's revenues are still expected to be 7.9 percent below the 2008 levels. And with Medicaid costs continuing to rise -- states now spend more on Medicaid than on elementary and high school education -- states find themselves hard-pressed to restore many of the deep cuts they have made to other services.
Now many governors are bracing for the prospect of cuts in federal aid, which provided states with roughly a third of their revenue last year.
''What we're really seeing here is there is not enough money to make up for any federal cuts,'' said Scott D. Pattison, the executive director of the state budget officers' association. ''What I've heard from the state budget people is that they've told departments and agencies in state government: Do not expect us to have the money available, even if we wanted to, to make up for federal cuts.''
The slow recovery is uneven, the fiscal survey found: 21 states are still not collecting as much revenue as they did before the recession, and almost half are spending less than they did before the recession. With Medicaid costs continuing to rise, many states were forced to continue to make cuts in other areas. The survey found that while states are spending more on Medicaid and elementary and secondary education this year, they are still cutting higher education, public assistance and corrections. Transportation spending is roughly flat.
The pressure states are under can be seen in some of the actions they are taking. Pennsylvania is thinking of privatizing the management of its lucrative state lottery, and is weighing a bid from the company that runs the National Lottery in Britain. Connecticut is planning another round of cuts that Gov. Dannel P. Malloy warns ''will have a real impact on people's lives.'' Ohio, which, like many states, has struggled to find money to maintain and improve its highways, announced a plan on Thursday to borrow against future toll revenues to pay for transportation projects.
Some services may never rebound from recent cuts, Mr. Pattison said, as states spend a bigger share of their limited resources on health care and education. ''In most states, I think, parks and recreation will never get back to the general fund levels they had in the past,'' he said. ''They'll be primarily funded by fees: campsite fees, admission fees, things like that. It's a small part of the pie, but I think it's an example of an area of state government that's just suffered in the recession and is not going to see a return, because the focus will be on these other areas.''
Dan Crippen, the executive director of the National Governors Association, characterized the slow growth in state revenues this way: ''While up is certainly better than down, no one is out singing 'Happy Days Are Here Again.' ''
States fear the outcome of the budget talks between President Obama and Congress, whether a deal is reached by the end of the year or not.
''If Congress fails to act by the end of the calendar year, federal funds flowing to states would decline under the process of automatic across-the-board spending cuts known as sequester,'' the report, the Fiscal Survey of States, warns. ''But even if a sequester is avoided, the likely policies required to address the nation's long-term fiscal debt problems may also reduce the level of federal funds for states.''
Mr. Crippen said that governors had been meeting with federal officials to try to make sure that they understood how changing the tax code or cutting federal spending would affect states.
Capping deductions for state and local taxes, he said, would have big ramifications for some states. Ending the tax exemption for municipal bonds could raise borrowing costs. If planned spending cuts to the military are allowed to take effect next year, it could hurt the economies of states heavily reliant on military spending. And if those cuts are averted, they could be replaced with more cuts to state grants.
''States understand that there are going to be reduced resources to states coming from the federal budget,'' Mr. Crippen said. ''States are going to need, as these programs get revamped and cut, a lot more discretion if they're going to provide the same level, or even near the same level, of services that they're providing today.''
The fiscal woes of states have been raising concern in recent years. Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, and Richard Ravitch, the former New York lieutenant governor, formed a State Budget Crisis Task Force to shine a spotlight on the issue.
As the group released its findings on New Jersey's fiscal problems in Trenton on Thursday, Mr. Ravitch said he had been stunned to learn that after the financial turmoil of 2008 no one in federal government was keeping close track of state and local fiscal troubles, since those levels of government employ about 19 million people and pay for 70 percent of America's infrastructure.
''If we don't solve this,'' he said, ''it's our democratic process that's going to be in the greatest jeopardy.''

Previews and Openings
'All That Fall' (opens on Wednesday) Ingmar Bergman personally asked Samuel Beckett for permission to adapt his 1956 radio play for the stage; so did Laurence Olivier. Both were told no. Enter Pan Pan Theater Company, which hails from Beckett's homeland of Ireland, one of the few groups that has received permission to stage the piece. Well, ''stage'' can be a broad term. Let's just say that the director, Gavin Quinn, will be providing audience members with a lot of rocking chairs and that the lighting and sound designers are working overtime on this one. Fishman Space, Fisher Building, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 321 Ashland Place, near Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org. (Eric Grode) 
'Flipside: The Patti Page Story' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Dec. 21) In case ''Forever Dusty'' hasn't whetted your appetite for jukebox musicals devoted to mid-20th-century female icons, along comes this entry with more than two dozen songs by the country-pop crossover queen known as the ''Singing Rage.'' Interviews with Ms. Page make up the play's text, which is surrounded by the likes of ''Tennessee Waltz'' and ''(How Much Is That) Doggie in the Window?'' 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org. (Grode)
'The Great God Pan' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) A young Brooklyn writer seems to have it all -- until the possibility of a dark childhood secret threatens to upend everything. It sounds like fairly well-traveled ground, but the fast-rising playwright Amy Herzog (''After the Revolution,'' ''4000 Miles''), along with a cast that includes Becky Ann Baker and Peter Friedman, should carve out some new vistas along the way. Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Grode)
'Mulan the Musical' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Wednesday) No, this is not Disney's latest adaptation of one of its hit musicals, despite being billed as family-friendly entertainment; the legend of Mulan predates the Disney film by some 1,500 years, give or take. This comes from China, where the renowned all-female percussion group the Red Poppy Ladies presents the story of a peasant girl who disguises herself as a man to replace her ailing father in the emperor's army. Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Grode)
'The Other Place' (in previews; opens on Jan. 10) Sharr White's twisty drama earned Laurie Metcalf an Obie Award in 2011; now it and she are making a somewhat delayed transfer to Broadway, with two new actors (including Daniel Stern) joining them. Ms. Metcalf plays a renowned neurologist whose research may be hitting too close to home -- and that's about all that's safe to divulge about the plot. Joe Mantello directs, as he did in 2011. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, Manhattan, (800) 432-7250, mtc-nyc.org. (Grode)
'Picnic' (previews start on Friday; opens on Jan. 13) Despite being a Pulitzer Prize winner (in 1954) and possibly William Inge's best-known play, ''Picnic'' has only been revived one other time on Broadway, when the Roundabout presented Kyle Chandler and Ashley Judd as the young lovers in 1994. Almost 20 years later, the Roundabout once again revisits it; this time the ubiquitous director Sam Gold (''Seminar,'' ''Circle Mirror Transformation'') has surrounded his young leads, Maggie Grace and Sebastian Stan, with a canny blend of theater mainstays (Reed Birney, Elizabeth Marvel) and Hollywood royalty (Ellen Burstyn). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Grode)
'There There' (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Wednesday) New York's Chekhov lovefest continues with Kristen Kosmas's adventurous-sounding bilingual modification of ''The Three Sisters.'' The conceit is that Christopher Walken is unable to go on in a solo show inspired by the self-destructive ''Three Sisters'' character Solyony, who is billed here as ''Chekhov's favorite sociopath.'' (High praise!) Picking up the slack -- sort of -- is an unwitting proofreader (Ms. Kosmas) and her Russian translator (Larissa Tokmakova). Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101, chocolatefactorytheater.org. (Grode)
'Water by the Spoonful' (in previews; opens on Jan. 8) It's not often that plays win the Pulitzer Prize before their New York debut, so Quiara Alegría Hudes's 2012 winner is eagerly anticipated. The second play in her Elliot Trilogy, following her 2007 work, ''Elliot, a Soldier's Fugue,'' follows the life of a young Puerto Rican veteran of the Iraq war and the two overlapping worlds -- one online, one real -- that keep him physically and psychologically afloat. Two ''Elliot'' veterans -- the actor Armando Riesco and the director Davis McCallum -- are on board for this one, too. Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Grode)
Broadway
'Annie' James Lapine's revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Katie Finneran and Anthony Warlow (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Bring It On: The Musical' An A-list of musical-theater artists -- Tom Kitt (''Next to Normal''), Lin-Manuel Miranda (''In the Heights''), Jeff Whitty (''Avenue Q'') and Amanda Green -- teamed to create this featherweight concoction inspired by the cult-fave movie about rival cheerleaders. The human pyrotechnics in the cheerleading sequences are the highlight (2:15). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
'Chaplin: The Musical' Though Rob McClure does a graceful impersonation of the title character of this soppy bio-musical, the off-screen Charlie Chaplin is often missing in action, devoured by a swarm of man-eating clichés. This gray-toned sour-smell-of-success story, featuring vaporous songs by Christopher Curtis and directed by Warren Carlyle, takes those clichés very seriously (2:30). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'A Christmas Story, The Musical' An amiable, blessedly ungarish holiday musical for family audiences, faithfully adapted from the popular 1983 movie drawing on the writings of Jean Shepherd (2:20). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com, achristmasstorythemusical.com. (Isherwood)
'Dead Accounts' As a prodigal son returned to Cincinnati from New York City, Norbert Leo Butz conjures fireworks out of very thin air in Theresa Rebeck's new comedy, directed by Jack O'Brien and featuring Katie Holmes. The play throws out many weighty subjects, but they all blur into a jet stream of semi-snappy dialogue before changing course and evaporating (2:00). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Elf' This stage musical based on the Will Ferrell movie returns to Broadway with Wayne Knight as the celebrity Santa, though he isn't around much. The production, like all the holiday-themed shows clogging New York theaters, has some funny moments, a couple of decent musical numbers and a lot of generic-feeling songs and synthetic sentiment. Jordan Gelber in the role of Buddy, the human raised as an elf who comes to New York to find his real father, never really finds a comfort zone for the sometimes awkward, sometimes perceptive character (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, elfmusical.com. (Neil Genzlinger)
'Evita' This just in: Eva Perón is still dead. That, anyway, is on the evidence of Michael Grandage's unsmiling revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's 1978 bio-musical, which feels about as warm-blooded as a gilded mummy. Elena Roger, Michael Cerveris and Ricky Martin are the stars of this earnest combination of requiem mass and history pageant (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, Manhattan, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Glengarry Glen Ross' The fight has gone out of the boys from David Mamet's 1984 Pulitzer Prize-winning drama of sharks in a small pond. In Daniel Sullivan's deflated production, which stars an extravagantly gesturing Al Pacino, it's as if all the competitive fierceness has been sucked from them by some cosmic super-vacuum cleaner. It also stars Bobby Cannavale as the hotshot Ricky Roma (1:40). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Golden Boy' Bartlett Sher directs a superbly cast revival of Clifford Odets's 1937 drama about a young man (Seth Numrich) torn between a career as a boxer and his first love, the violin. It's a richly atmospheric production that cuts to the emotional quick of Odets's still-vital play (2:45). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
'Grace' Craig Wright's cool, strangulated essay of a play about forms of faith isn't as intellectually unsettling as it means to be. But the cast (which includes Paul Rudd, Ed Asner and Kate Arrington) is very good under Dexter Bullard's direction. And Michael Shannon confirms his status as our most convincing interpreter of uneasy American manhood (1:40). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Heiress' Masterpiece Theater on Broadway. Moisés Kaufman's revival of Ruth and Augustus Goetz's sturdy war horse, starring a one-note Jessica Chastain, is lovely to look at, easy to follow -- and aside from a vivid supporting performance from Judith Ivey -- about as full of real life as an Olde New York Christmas window in a department store (2:45). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'The Mystery of Edwin Drood' A boisterous, well-cast revival of Rupert Holmes's Tony-winning 1986 musical, which gives the audience the chance to choose the identity of the killer of the titular hero. Chita Rivera lends an air of authentic glamour, Jim Norton is a cutup as the music-hall proprietor, and the young cast sings the lovely score with great skill (2:35). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Newsies' This Disney musical -- adapted from the 1992 movie and inspired by the newsboy strike of 1899 -- markets Urchin Appeal with extra! extra! enthusiasm. Jeff Calhoun directs a cast of comely, if overgrown, ragamuffins. The largely interchangeable songs are by Alan Menken and Jack Feldman (2:20). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (866) 870-2717, newsiesthemusical.com. (Brantley)
'Nice Work if You Can Get It' Every now and then a bubble of pure, tickling charm rises from the artificial froth of this pastiche 1920s musical, directed by Kathleen Marshall and featuring songs by George and Ira Gershwin. But mostly the production, starring Matthew Broderick and Kelli O'Hara, registers as a shiny, dutiful trickle of gags and production numbers (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Once' This gentle musical, set in Dublin, about a love affair that never quite happens -- based on the 2006 movie -- inventively uses songs (by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova) and dance to convey a beautiful shimmer of might-have-been regret. Staged by John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett (''Black Watch''), the production stars the immensely appealing Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti (2:15). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Peter and the Starcatcher' The most exhilarating and inventive example of story theater since the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.'' This production, about the boy who became Peter Pan, is an enchanted anatomy of the urge to defy gravity. Roger Rees and Alex Timbers direct (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' Pam MacKinnon's shattering 50th-anniversary revival of Edward Albee's hair-raising drama of marital discord stars an electrifying Tracy Letts (of ''August: Osage County'' fame) as George and Amy Morton (ditto) as Martha, ably supported by Carrie Coon and Madison Dirks as the young couple they use as cannon fodder. Not to be missed (3:05). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
Off Broadway
'Bad Jews' The wonderful Tracee Chimo (''Circle Mirror Tranformation,'' ''Bachelorette'') gives a sensational performance in Joshua Harmon's play, portraying a smart, funny and seriously abrasive young woman who is embroiled in a dispute with her cousin over who is entitled to a family heirloom (1:40). Black Box Theater at the Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, Manhattan, (212) 719-1300, roundaboutunderground.org. (Isherwood)
'Bare' Having shepherded a sanitized overhaul of that delirious orgy of pig's blood on prom night, ''Carrie,'' this year, the director Stafford Arima has now turned to this tragic tale of star-cross'd gay lovers in a coed Roman Catholic boarding school. While the boys try to keep their romance secret, the truth comes spilling out during the school drama club's production of -- you guessed it -- ''Romeo and Juliet.'' Retooled significantly since its first incarnation in 2000, this emo musical has been updated to reflect attitudes toward homophobia and bullying in the ''It Gets Better'' era. But despite touching moments and a committed cast, the material is too painfully earnest and riddled with clichés to connect with audiences not still mired in adolescence (2:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, baremusicalnyc.com. (David Rooney)
&#x2605; 'A Civil War Christmas' Paula Vogel's play is a beautifully stitched tapestry of American lives set during the chilly winter of 1964. Characters include Abraham Lincoln (a dignified Bob Stillman) and his troubled wife, Mary Todd Lincoln (an affecting Alice Ripley) but also Mary Todd's dressmaker, a slave who purchased her freedom named Elizabeth Keckley (the fine Karen Kandel) along with soldiers on both sides of the conflict. It's a rare holiday entertainment that won't nauseate the adults, and should edify the children without boring them (2:30). New York Theater Workshop, 79 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 279-4200, nytw.org, ticketcentral.com. (Isherwood)
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
&#x2605; 'Disgraced' A stimulating, eloquent and bitingly funny new play by Ayad Akhtar about a corporate lawyer of Muslim origins (the excellent Aasif Mandvi of ''The Daily Show'') whose well-heeled life begins to unravel when he becomes involved in a court case involving an unjustly jailed imam (1:20). Claire Tow Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com, lct3.org. (Isherwood)
'Emotional Creature' This collage of songs, monologues and spoken-word pieces by Eve Ensler explore the problems facing young women around the globe, from sex-slavery to the plague of mean girls. Performed with vivifying passion by a talented young cast of six (1:30). Pershing Square Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Isherwood)
'Falling' The Martin family, in Deanna Jent's compact play, is trying to live a normal life despite the outsize presence of their severely autistic son, Josh (effectively portrayed by Daniel Everidge). When a Bible-toting grandmother visits, the emotional temperature rises, and with it Josh's potential for violence. Despite some implausible stacking of the dramatic deck by the playwright, ''Falling'' makes some sound points and invites further investigation into the disorder (1:15). Minetta Lane Theater, 18 Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (800) 982-2787, ticketmaster.com. (Andy Webster)
'5 Lesbians Eating a Quiche' This frolicsome play, about a women's club in 1956, ventures into such heady excesses of absurdism, it deserves to be called Mama-ist. (Dada wouldn't do at all.) As written by Evan Linder and Andrew Hobgood, with Sarah Gitenstein directing, ''Quiche'' takes a giant leap from punning smirkiness into the outer space of nonsense (1:15). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Van Dam Street, South Village, sohoplayhouse.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Forbidden Broadway: Alive and Kicking' Gerard Alessandrini's essential satirical cheat sheet to Broadway musicals returns after a three-year absence, packing polished brass knuckles. A precisionist cast of four provides vocal cartoons as evocative as Al Hirschfeld's caricatures. This show not only tickles but also pierces the Achilles' heels of the productions under scrutiny (1:40). At the 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Forever Dusty' If Kristen Holly Smith turned up to your costume party in Dusty Springfield drag and started singing, there would be no mistaking the woman she was channeling. But doing a passable impersonation is a far cry from capturing the essence of one of the most distinctive female vocalists of all time, as this amateurish inflated cabaret act demonstrates. Written in by-the-numbers basics by Ms. Smith and Jonathan Vankin, and directed with minimal finesse by Randal Myler, this misconceived bio-musical is a soulless tribute to the platinum-haired, panda-eyed queen of white soul. She deserves better (1:40). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, foreverdusty.net. (Rooney)
&#x2605; 'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Webster)
'From the Ground Up' Daring Australians fly through the air in Circus Oz's fast and furious show, which owes something to vaudeville as well as the circus. Recommended for ages 5 and up, this is the holiday offering at the New Victory Theater, and it's a good one: a little naughty, a little nice, a little death-defying (1:40). New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, 10th floor, Manhattan, (646) 223-3010, newvictory.org. (Rachel Saltz)
'Golden Age' Terrence McNally's comedy-drama, set backstage on the first night of the opera composer Vincenzo Bellini's last opera (''I Puritani''), is sadly hackneyed and contrived. Lee Pace plays the composer, and Bebe Neuwirth the famed singer Maria Malibran (2:30). City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, manhattantheatreclub.com. (Isherwood)
'Golden Land' The upbeat six-person acting ensemble in this National Yiddish Theater-Folksbiene production seems game for the two-hour rendition of the entire New York Jewish immigrant experience, from the 1880s to the 1940s. In montages and medleys, partly in Yiddish and partly in English, the audience is transported to Ellis Island, the Lower East Side, the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire, union protests, the Holocaust and more. The characters are more or less generic immigrant archetypes, but the actors do a great job of hiding how exhausted they must be from the constant march of history and costume changes (2:00). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, nationalyiddishtheatre.org. (Catherine Rampell)
'The Good Mother' Gretchen Mol (''Boardwalk Empire'') plays the title role of a troubled young woman with man problems in Francine Volpe's murky, sluggish drama, directed by Scott Elliott for the New Group (1:40).

'If There Is I Haven't Found It Yet' Jake Gyllenhaal makes a very creditable New York stage debut as the stoner uncle of a troubled 15-year-old girl (Annie Funke) in Nick Payne's earnest, shaggy (and conceptually overwrought) story of global warming and domestic meltdown. Michael Longhurst directs a cast rounded out by Brian F. O'Byrne and Michelle Gomez (1:35). Laura Pels Theater, Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley)
'It's a Wonderful Life: The 1946 Live Radio Play' Irish Repertory Theater's adaptation of Frank Capra's perennial holiday movie offers six actors (and one effects specialist) handling 25 roles, in a 70-minute condensation of the original, which was more than two hours. The film's fans may pine for the deleted passages, but the production's invention, humor and charm helps to soothe the loss (1:10). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Webster)
'Let's Kill Grandma This Christmas' After worming her way into grandma's will, a slutty blonde conspires with her sister's husband to off the family matriarch. The end product is the theatrical equivalent of a mediocre holiday movie, replete with the usual Hollywood clichés: a potty-mouthed grandma; lots of bickering beneath the Christmas tree; a triumphant, drunken meltdown from the mousy pushover; a high-fiving, unemployed meathead; a nasally henpecked nerd; and even an O. J. Simpson joke, which is almost a parody of lazy writing (2:10). Theater at St. Clement's, 423 West 46th Street, Clinton, letskillgrandmatheplay.com. (Rampell)
'My Name Is Asher Lev' Aaron Posner's adaptation of Chaim Potok's novel feels like a well-made play from the era in which the story takes place -- the 1950s. Set in a Hasidic community in Brooklyn, this tale of an artistic prodigy has been directed with an attention to emotional nuance by Gordon Edelstein and features strong performances from its three-person cast: Ari Brand, Mark Nelson and Jenny Bacon (1:30).

'Old Jews Telling Jokes' With old jokes, a few songs and a little schmaltz, this winning revue is simple, effective entertainment executed with obvious affection (1:20). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Jason Zinoman)

&#x2605; 'The Piano Lesson' August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, set in Pittsburgh in 1936, returns in a galvanizingly beautiful staging by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, featuring memorable performances virtually across the board.

'P.S. Jones and the Frozen City' Robert Askins's superhero spoof features striking, inventive animated backgrounds that tend to upstage the action, despite some quirkily amusing writing from this author of ''Hand to God'' (1:20).

'Restoration Comedy' Amy Freed's mash-up of two late-17th-century frolics juggles bawdy humor and elastic morality as it examines questions of love, marriage and licentiousness. While the adventures of an inveterate womanizer and the efforts of his prim wife to tame him via masked seduction are diverting, the play is not really the thing here. Ed Sylvanus Iskander's raucous production, featuring the Flea's caffeinated and fabulously costumed young acting ensemble, the Bats, is more about the Baroque-glam rock happening. In addition to libidinous displays of pole dancing and other savory skills set to Scissor Sisters tunes during the play proper, the lengthy evening also includes a preshow musicale with cocktails, an extended variety entr'acte with dumplings being served and a girl group covering En Vogue and Mariah Carey, and a post-show dance party (3:25).

&#x2605; 'Tribes' Nina Raine's smart, lively and beautifully acted play asks us to hear how we hear, in silence as well as speech. This British import considers the passive and aggressive forms of listening within an insular, intellectual family, whose members include a deaf son. David Cromer is the expert director (2:15).

'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike' Nomenclature would seem to be fate for the title characters of Christopher Durang's sunny comedy about gloomy people. David Hyde Pierce, Kristine Nielsen and Sigourney Weaver portray three siblings (if not three sisters) whose parents burdened them with Chekovian names. Nicholas Martin directs this surprisingly mild-mannered work from a savage satirist (2:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Volpone, or the Fox' This straightforward revival of Ben Jonson's classic comedy is full of small but potent pleasures, particularly performances by Tovah Feldshuh and Alvin Epstein (1:30). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 352-3101, redbulltheater.com. (Zinoman)
&#x2605; 'What Rhymes With America' Melissa James Gibson's touching, mournful play examines the disappointed lives of a quartet of interlocked characters.

'Radio City Christmas Spectacular' After last year's update, this annual extravaganza returns with a paucity of new material. But the Rockettes are forever splendid: regal in their precision, radiant in their costumes, exuberant in their high kicks. Yes, there's a cheesy narrative thread, but also a new and fascinating look at Rockettes fashions through the decades. (It's the troupe's 85th year.)

Last Chance
'The Anarchist' (closes on Sunday) They sure talk fancy in the clink these days. David Mamet's heavily embroidered slip of a play portrays a notorious convict (an excellent Patti LuPone) up for parole and at the mercy of a judgmental warden (a rote Debra Winger). During a polysyllabic 70 minutes, they discuss eschatology, phenomenology, etymology and, oh yes, criminology (1:10). John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, theanarchistbroadway.com. (Brantley)
'Be Careful! The Sharks Will Eat You!' (closes on Saturday) In his one-man show, Jay Alvarez recounts his family's escape from Cuba in 1964, when he was just 4. Acting at least a half-dozen roles, Mr. Alvarez is an evocative taleteller when reliving the yearlong plans his father made that delivered as many as 30 refugees by boat to the United States. Despite the title, though, and to the play's disadvantage, he describes almost nothing of the 30-hour voyage itself (1:30). Stage Left Studio, 214 West 30th Street, Manhattan, stageleftstudio.net. (Daniel M. Gold)
'The Boss' (closes on Sunday) Regan, an Irish immigrant who builds himself into a ruthless shipping magnate, extorts a socialite into marrying him. In retaliation, his bride's brother whips Regan's workers into a strike. Regan cannot empathize with the countrymen he employs, impoverishes and once lived among, and he vows revenge. Dave Hanson's spectacular performance as the anti-hero parvenu gives this class-conscious revival from 1911 emotional and political relevance, particularly in the era of the 99 percenters (2:30). Metropolitan Playhouse, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 995-5302, metropolitanplayhouse.org. (Rampell)
'Giant' (closes on Sunday) Michael John LaChiusa's lush score for this adaptation of Edna Ferber's generation-spanning 1952 novel reaches for the clouds. But the countervailing weight of condensing a multitude of themes and plot points keeps pulling this show down to earth, and even threatens to bury it. Michael Greif directs an attractive cast led by Brian D'Arcy James and Kate Baldwin (3:15). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley)
'Golden Child' (closes on Sunday) The first production in the Signature Theater's season devoted to the work of David Henry Hwang is a revival of his 1996 play about a family in early-20th-century China grappling with the encroaching ideals of the West. Julyana Soelistyo, who starred in the original production as the young woman whose bound feet become a bone of contention, is a standout as the sternest and most recalcitrant of the three wives in the family (2:00). Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 244-7529, signaturetheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Hearts Like Fists' (closes on Saturday) This madcap satire by Adam Szymkowicz about hospital nurses doubling as masked superheroines sends up comic books and soap opera in equal measure. Parody and punches fly, and you may just find yourself knocked out. In a good way (1:40). Secret Theater, 44-02 23rd Street, Long Island City, Queens, (866) 811-4111, fluxtheatre.org. (Webster)
&#x2605; 'Mies Julie' (closes on Sunday) The temperature never stops rising in Yael Farber's blistering drama, which resets Strindberg's ''Miss Julie'' in contemporary South Africa. But be advised: This is a fire that chills as it destroys. Hilda Cronje and Bongile Mantsai give full-immersion performances as the doomed lovers whose very identities come under siege. Ms. Farber directs, compellingly and mercilessly (1:30). St. Ann's Warehouse, 29 Jay Street, at Plymouth Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Murder Ballad' (closes on Sunday) A small but savvy musical that panders in style to those of us who lap up febrile accounts of fatal attractions. Julia Jordan and Juliana Nash's contemporary tale of a razor-edged love triangle knows exactly what it wants to do, and does it most efficiently, with a sexy four-member cast, directed by Trip Cullman (1:15). City Center, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Brantley)
'The Outgoing Tide' (closes on Sunday) The Philadelphia playwright Bruce Graham examines right-to-die issues as reflected in the tough choices made by a retired trucking company owner facing encroaching dementia. Starring Peter Strauss, Michael Learned and Ian Lithgow, the play maps the man's emotionally fraught standoff with his wife of 50 years and their adult son as he seeks to atone for his mistakes while sparing himself further indignity. Well received in its regional engagements, the play is sensitively observed and affecting if somewhat pedestrian in Bud Martin's production (2:10). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org.

'The Twenty-Seventh Man' (closes on Sunday) Nathan Englander's stage adaptation of his crisp, economical short story (from the collections ''For the Relief of Unbearable Urges'') feels sadly bloated and static onstage, despite fine work from a first-rate cast that includes Ron Rifkin and Chip Zien (1:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Isherwood)
'We Are Proud to Present a Presentation About the Herero of Namibia, Formerly Known as Southwest Africa, From the German Sudwestafrika, Between the Years 1844-1915' (closes on Sunday) A group of six actors engage in tense rehearsals for a play about the first genocide of the 20th century in Jackie Sibblies Drury's inventive, superbly acted drama about the disturbing emotions stirred by their seemingly playful interactions (1:30). Soho Rep, 46 Walker Street, TriBeCa, (212) 352-3101, sohorep.org. (Isherwood)

HEADLINE: UBS Unit Is Said to Be Close to Guilty Plea in Rate-Rigging Scandal

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
10:00 p.m. | Updated Federal prosecutors are close to securing a guilty plea from a UBS subsidiary at the center of a global investigation into interest rate manipulation, the first big bank to agree to criminal charges in more than a decade.
UBS is in final negotiations with American, British and Swiss authorities to settle accusations that its employees reported false rates, a deal in which the bank's Japanese unit is expected to plead guilty to a criminal charge, according to people briefed on the matter who spoke of private discussions on the condition of anonymity. Along with the rare admission of criminal wrongdoing at the subsidiary, UBS could face about $1 billion in fines and regulatory sanctions, the people said.
The steep penalty, a surprise given the bank's cooperation in the case, would represent the largest fine to date in the rate-rigging investigation. In June, the British bank Barclays agreed to pay $450 million to settle accusations that it influenced crucial benchmarks.
The settlement with UBS, which is based in Switzerland, could come as soon as Monday, the people briefed on the matter said. These people cautioned that the bank's board had not yet approved the deal and it could still fall apart. 
By pushing for a guilty plea, the Justice Department may be signaling a new aggressive stance.
Authorities have been reluctant to indict big banks, fearful of the potential for job losses and the ripple effect through the broader economy. If a bank pleads guilty to a crime, the case can be tantamount to a death sentence because the institution may lose its charter to operate.
With UBS, federal prosecutors are trying to strike a balance. By levying a charge against the subsidiary, authorities send a powerful message, but stop far short of putting the company out of business.
Prosecutors decided against indicting HSBC over money laundering, concerned over the repercussions to the financial system. Instead, HSBC, the British bank, agreed on Monday to pay a record $1.9 billion in penalties.
On Thursday, Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to Eric H. Holder Jr., the attorney general, criticizing the Justice Department for an "inexplicable unwillingness to prosecute and convict those responsible for aiding and abetting drug lords and terrorists," referring in part to the HSBC case. Mr. Grassley called the fine "hardly even a slap on the wrist," given HSBC's profit.
But the UBS case offers authorities a long-awaited moment to criminally punish a big bank. While the public is still simmering over the lack of prosecutions stemming from the financial crisis, the actions against UBS could help damp concerns that the world's largest and most interconnected banks are too big to indict.
The Justice Department's criminal division, which arranged the guilty plea with the Japanese subsidiary, could also strike a nonprosecution agreement with the parent company, the people briefed on the matter said. The deal will force UBS to continue cooperating with the wider rate manipulation case.
In a statement, a UBS spokeswoman said the bank continued "to work closely with various regulatory authorities to resolve issues relating to the setting of certain global benchmark interest rates. As we are in active discussions with these authorities, we cannot comment further." The authorities leading the case - the Justice Department, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Financial Services Authority of Britain and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority - declined to comment.
As the UBS investigation comes to a close, global authorities are fast-tracking several civil and criminal cases in connection to the manipulation of important benchmarks, including the London interbank offered rate, or Libor. Regulators and prosecutors have uncovered evidence that points to a systemic problem with the rate-setting process, which underpins trillions of dollars of financial products like mortgages, student loans and credit cards.
Authorities contend that some bank employees reported false rates to squeeze out extra trading profits and deflect concerns about their health during the financial crisis.
The fallout from the Libor case could be significant. The Royal Bank of Scotland has indicated that it could announce penalties before its next earnings release in a couple of months. Deutsche Bank also has set aside money to cover potential fines. In all, the investigation has ensnared more than a dozen big banks.
The push for criminal charges at UBS caught the bank off guard.
After settling a tax evasion case in 2009, the bank was eager to cooperate with authorities and gain leniency in the Libor case. UBS, for example, reached a conditional immunity deal with the antitrust arm of the Justice Department, which was supposed to protect the bank from criminal prosecution under certain conditions. But the deal did not extend to the Justice Department's criminal division, giving authorities some leeway to take action.
With its reputation and profits on the line, the bank moved to dissuade the criminal division from pursuing charges. Bank officials have been meeting with authorities in Washington in a last-ditch effort to influence the outcome, according to the people briefed on the matter.
Eventually, the bank agreed to the broad contours of a settlement that included a guilty plea by the Japanese subsidiary. The bank is still negotiating the final elements of the deal.
Prosecutors are also expected to charge a former UBS trader who featured prominently in the investigation. On Tuesday, Britain's Serious Fraud Office arrested three men in connection with the Libor case, including Thomas Hayes, a 33-year-old former trader at UBS and Citigroup, according to people with knowledge of the matter. The three men, which also included two people who worked at the British brokerage firm R P Martin, were released on bail the same day.
A lawyer for Mr. Hayes could not be located.
Mr. Hayes is expected to be a central figure in the case against UBS. The UBS settlement is likely to include accusations that Mr. Hayes and other employees colluded with traders at other banks to influence the direction of interest rates, as part of a broader scheme to increase their profits. Some UBS traders have been suspended or fired over the matter.
Mr. Hayes built his reputation as an interest rates trader at UBS. He worked at the Tokyo office of UBS from about 2006 to 2009 before departing for Citigroup. Citigroup fired Mr. Hayes the next year, for approaching a trading desk about influencing the yen-denominated Libor rates, and the bank reported his actions to regulators.
The role of Japanese operations came to the forefront last December when the country's regulator sanctioned both UBS and Citigroup. Local regulators discovered that traders at the banks had tried to manipulate the Tokyo interbank offered rate, or Tibor, a main benchmark for borrowing in Japan.
The efforts to rig the rate were "unjust and malicious, and could undermine the fairness of the markets," the Securities and Exchange Surveillance Commission of Japan said in a statement when recommending the nonfinancial penalties against UBS.
UBS has a big presence in Japan. The bank has more than 1,100 employees in the country, spread across its major business lines.
The guilty plea could have collateral consequences for the unit. For one, the guilty plea delivers a painful blow to its reputation, securities experts say. Depending on the details of the case, the group could also be subjected to an independent monitor and face some limitations on its business.

HEADLINE: Where Opposites Attract

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
NEW HAVEN -- In a museum era dominated by the vying forces of bad economics and compulsive building, it's a miracle when something comes out right, which makes the opening of the splendidly renovated and expanded Yale University Art Gallery here a happy event. The angels of art, design and budgetary planning were on duty. Everything worked. The country's oldest university art museum has arrived at a kind of institutional ideal of opposites in balance.
After the expansion -- all interior work, with one discreet addition -- the museum has gained substantial usable space. It's large enough to get lost in, but intimate enough for close art encounters. There's a lot more art to see than before, from a collection that's now closer than ever to being encyclopedic, with a mix not found in a masterpieces-only museum. Objects grand and modest keep company; high sits with low; silly with serious; flawless with ruined. 
As a result of all this, which came to fruition with a reopening this week, a respected institution is already assuming the aura of a destination. Local art lovers can stay close to home and enjoy it; the full global picture has come to them. New Yorkers, who have museums huge and tiny but few at the harmonious in-between scale of this one, will want to start checking New Haven train times.
Harmony was by no means inevitable in this project. As was typical of old museums, this one was accumulated rather than planned, put together in pieces across different eras, each with different styles and values. The process started in 1831 when the artist John Trumbull, a Connecticut native, sold Yale a series of paintings he'd done of the American Revolution and designed an on-campus museum to hold them.
Art attracts art, and soon more came Yale's way, chiefly American painting and copies of European old masters, until the pattern-breaking arrival of ancient Assyrian reliefs from what is now Iraq, in the 1850s. The reliefs were big; Trumbull's museum was not, and in the 1860s a new one had to be built. Called Street Hall, it's the oldest of the three contiguous, utterly unalike buildings that together make up the expanded museum.
Street Hall also began to fill, notably with Italian Renaissance paintings. They originally belonged to James Jackson Jarves, a diplomat, art critic and all-purpose entrepreneur who repeatedly gambled with fortunes and lost: you envision him with a perpetual sheen of flop-sweat on his brow. He had picked up the paintings cheaply in Europe, added top-dollar names -- Duccio, Giotto, Raphael -- and offered them to an art-hungry Yale as collateral for a loan. In 1871 repayment of the loan came due; Jarves was broke, again, and the university got the pictures.
What a deal. Some attributions have dropped a notch; others have risen. But at the core of the Jarves group is one of the finest ensembles of 13th- and 14th-century Italian painting in any museum, anywhere. They include a jewel-like altarpiece panel by that most elusive of Renaissance figures, Andrea di Cione, known as Orcagna, and a gable-shaped ''Crucifixion'' by Guido da Siena, which, in terms of preservation, is as perfect as perfect can be.
And art kept coming, often from alumni, often in waves shaped by international politics, market trends and period fashion. It came in dizzying varieties: Greek vases, Egyptian friezes, Peruvian textiles. It came large (the Assyrian reliefs) and small. The museum's celebrated American collection, now in a refurbished Street Hall, is a cornucopia of silver, glass and ceramics, with bowls, plates, creamers, beakers, bottles, vases, flagons, pitchers and teapots virtually spilling out of display cases.
Then there were more bulk deliveries, important ones, like a shipment of archaeological finds from the site of Dura-Europos, a city that flourished up to the third century in what is now Syria and that yielded a cross-cultural wealth of religious material, including sculptures of Roman gods, Jewish paintings and some of the earliest known depictions of Jesus.
By the time the Dura-Europos trove reached New Haven, there had been a further museum expansion, into a new building, Florentine Gothic in style. That was in 1928. The museum was still, essentially, a 19th-century institution, just beginning to inch toward the 20th century. It didn't get there for a while, but when it did, it was with a leap.
The catalyst was another Connecticut resident, the artist and collector Katherine Dreier. Born in Brooklyn in 1877, she met Marcel Duchamp in 1916 and, with him and Man Ray, formed a private advocacy group, the Société Anonyme, in support of avant-garde art. Support, in her case, mainly meant buying new art, and she amassed enormous holdings that she kept in her Connecticut home.
In 1941, hoping to turn that house into a museum, she approached Yale gallery personnel for advice, and they had just one suggestion: Give us the art. She agreed, and in a stroke, the museum was on the Modernist map. Over the past few years highlights from this collection have toured the country as the exhibition ''Société Anonyme: Modernism for America.'' Now the show, looking daisy-fresh, is ensconced in a suite of new galleries that connects the 1866 and 1928 buildings as part of the overall renovation by Duncan Hazard and Richard Olcott of Ennead Architects in New York.
The Société's front-runners -- Duchamp, Kandinsky, Kurt Schwitters -- are here. And so are many intriguing, now forgotten artists, several of them women, including Dreier. Scanning the names, I saw nearly a dozen I didn't know, and nearly a dozen theses and dissertations waiting to be written.
In 1953 a third building, by Louis Kahn, joined the others. Kahn's design, with imposing tetrahedral ceilings, remains controversial as an art setting. But it still feels innovative and daring, and atmospherically right for Yale's two youngest non-Western collections, those of African and Indo-Pacific art.
The present African installation, in place for a while, has recently been enhanced by the addition of antique sculptures from Mali and Nigeria. Such art, often caught up in international cultural property disputes, is both understudied and the focus of heated debates. What you see at Yale is its expressiveness, complex but straight to the heart. The sight of rows of terra-cotta heads, lined up as if sprouting from the earth, makes a powerful impression, deepened by the knowledge that most of the sculptures were field-collected in Africa in the 1950s and '60s by the civil rights leader Bayard Rustin.
The major news, though, is the debut of the Indo-Pacific gallery. If you need one irrefutable reason for a visit, this is it. The collection, primarily promised gifts, is relatively new to the museum, as is its curator, Ruth Barnes, who comes from the Ashmolean Museum at the University of Oxford. For this inaugural presentation, she seems to have brought out as much art as possible, and she's absolutely right to have done so. The installation is enrapturing, as intricately patterned as the Indonesian textiles and Borneo carvings that fill it.
Like most ambitious museums, Yale's is acquiring a lot of contemporary work. (Its prodigious director, Jock Reynolds, who masterminded the expansion project, is himself a sculptor.) There is plenty of contemporary art on view, along with many terrific examples of postwar modernism by the big names of the period. Yet a New York visitor, with ready access to Chelsea and the Museum of Modern Art, may want to concentrate on other aspects of the collection, and on types of images seldom seen elsewhere.
For example, few American mainstream museums give space to the agonized, outré emotionalism of 16th-century Spanish religious art, the kind of painting John of the Cross would have seen.
Yale does. Just this year the museum bought a fantastic painting by Luis de Morales of Christ carrying the Cross, his tormented body light against dark, like a candle in a confessional.
At the Metropolitan Museum of Art and MoMA you can see van Goghs as great as Yale's ''Night Café.'' But you're less likely to find, tucked in a corner, as you do at Yale, a tiny, blissful heartbreaker of an oil sketch by Georges Seurat, this one depicting a little cow under a tree in a sunny summer field.
And it takes a particular kind of museum to place old and new art genres in natural equilibrium, as Yale does in a pre-Columbian gallery that displays a classical 15th-century ceramic head of the Aztec god of music against an exacting 21st-century watercolor copy of a Maya mural made by a young, Yale-trained archaeological illustrator.
Balance. For decades we've had an art culture that tries to wow us with too muchness -- blockbusters, biennials, bank-breaking museum buildings no one needs -- and that ends up delivering way too little. Could it be that the day of just enough is upon us, and that Yale's just right museum is a bellwether?
The Yale University Art Gallery is at 1111 Chapel Street, New Haven; (203) 432-0600, artgallery.yale.edu. The exhibition ''Société Anonyme: Modernism for America'' runs through July 14.

HEADLINE: Borders and Epochs, Dissolving at His Keyboard

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER

 BODY:
EARLY in his career, beginning in the 1950s, the pianist and bandleader Eddie Palmieri used to play mambo shows at the Palladium Ballroom, on Broadway at 53rd Street. The Ed Sullivan Theater was just across the street but seemed to belong to a different, distant world: while Sullivan's popular Sunday night TV show was happy to book the likes of Señor Wences, the Spanish ventriloquist, the frenetically danceable Latin music that Mr. Palmieri played was thought to lack mainstream appeal.
But on Friday and Saturday, Jazz at Lincoln Center will sponsor a retrospective of Mr. Palmieri's career at the Rose Theater, seven blocks north of his old stomping grounds. Next month he will perform in a show at the Kennedy Center in Washington; also next month the National Endowment for the Arts willl induct him as a ''jazz master,'' putting him in the company of keyboard luminaries like Count Basie, Dave Brubeck and Herbie Hancock. 
''It's about time,'' said Robert Farris Thompson, the Yale cultural historian whose latest book, ''Aesthetic of the Cool: Afro-Atlantic Art and Music,'' includes an essay on Mr. Palmieri. ''We're talking about one of the great figures in American vernacular music, a multifaceted world-class musician who blends and zigzags between cultures, between the modern and the ancient, going past all boundaries.''
Mr. Palmieri, an ebullient bantam of a man who turns 76 on Saturday, said he welcomed the distinctions coming his way, but also found a certain irony in them. He was born in Spanish Harlem and raised in the Bronx as part of an extended family that had recently migrated from Puerto Rico, and when he was playing stickball in the streets with Cuban and Puerto Rican music pouring out of nearby bodegas, he said jazz was the furthest thing from his thoughts.
''When I was growing up, I knew nothing about jazz, really, and I didn't like it because I didn't comprehend it,'' he said last week. ''My whole life was dedicated to Latin music.'' Even now, he added: ''I play jazz and use jazz structures and harmony. But I'm not really a jazz pianist, which makes this award unique.''
To both jazz and Latin music fans, Mr. Palmieri's unusual style is instantly recognizable. His songs often feature angular melodies and modal passages, and he plays emphatically, almost like a percussionist, with lots of chord clusters, some containing hints of dissonance. On the mambo circuit, he recalls, he attacked the piano with such force that he was given the nickname Pancho Rompetecla, or Pancho the Keyboard Breaker.
Not coincidentally, Mr. Palmieri began his career as a percussionist, playing timbales at the age of 13 in bands led by or featuring his older brother, Charlie, a pianist who was his first big musical influence. He jokes that he switched back to the piano, which he had studied as a child, only because he got tired of hauling percussion gear around and wanted to save money by playing an instrument that club owners had to provide.
''I'm a drummer at heart, I love the percussion,'' he said. ''That's what makes you move, it's the pulse of life.'' Mr. Palmieri said the jazz saxophonist Donald Harrison, who often plays with him, ''always tells me, 'You know Eddie, you solo like a drummer.' But that's natural, because no matter how you want to play it, the piano is a percussion instrument, hammers on strings.''
The first of the many ensembles Mr. Palmieri has led was La Perfecta, founded in 1961. It immediately drew attention because it took charanga, a traditional Cuban style focused on violins and flute, and made it bold and brassy by substituting a pair of trombones for the strings. That sound, with the trombonist Barry Rogers taking a leading role, came to be known as ''the roaring elephants,'' and Mr. Palmieri further intensified his music's rhythmic drive by recruiting top percussionists like Manny Oquendo.
''Eddie revolutionized Latin music, and had a huge impact on musicians, especially me,'' said the pianist Larry Harlow, who helped create the Fania salsa sound of the 1960s and '70s as a bandleader, producer and arranger. ''He took these very tropical Cuban rhythms and added this new harmonic thing, modern jazz chords in a Latin context. Other players were good, but not dynamic like Eddie, who stood out as an innovator.''
In 2009 the Library of Congress added ''Azúcar Pa' Ti,'' a La Perfecta recording from 1965, to its national registry of historic recordings (along with Little Richard's ''Tutti Frutti'' and Howlin' Wolf's ''Smokestack Lightning''). Mr. Palmieri's work from that era is often described as a foundation for the New York style that came to be known as salsa, but he recoils from that notion.
''Salsa is a misnomer, and a high degree of lack of respect for rhythmic and sacred religious patterns that all have their proper names,'' he said. ''You start with rumba, and then you have mambo, cha cha cha, guaracha, changüí, danzón, bolero. All that came from Cuba, and to lump it under the word salsa and claim it came out of here, that is'' ridiculous, he said.
After La Perfecta dissolved, in 1968, Mr. Palmieri's music, while retaining its swing, took on a more overtly political coloration. He read the work of the radical 19th-century economist Henry George; played benefits for César Chávez and the farm workers' union; performed at prisons like Sing Sing, Attica and Rikers Island; and recorded songs with titles like ''Justicia'' or ''Revolt/La Libertad Logico.''
All the while, Mr. Palmieri had been listening intently to jazz players like Thelonious Monk, Miles Davis and John Coltrane, whose original quartet he first saw at Birdland, just down the block from the Palladium, in the intervals between his own sets. He and his brother Charlie incorporated those influences, along with soul, funk and blues elements, into a new ensemble called Harlem River Drive, creating the expanded template that marked most of his best work throughout the 1970s, like ''Vamonos Pa'l Monte'' and ''Adoración.''
Even classical music became part of the mix. In an animated three-hour interview last week, Mr. Palmieri referred to works by Bach, Chopin and, especially, Debussy that he admires and has studied. Mr. Thompson, who describes Mr. Palmieri's music as ''Schoenberg with a beat,'' recalls seeing La Perfecta at the Palladium in the 1960s and not believing his ears when he heard Mr. Palmieri quoting from Mendelssohn in a solo.
Mr. Thompson also perceives certain similarities between Mr. Palmieri and Bartok, mainly in their fondness for dissonant chords and chromaticism. One of Mr. Palmieri's ''great contributions, a minor miracle, really,'' he said, ''is that he took abstruse elements of music'' and put them into a danceable form, without meeting audience resistance.
''I didn't care, I just played,'' Mr. Palmieri said when asked how he achieved that. ''Those dissonances are attention grabbers that, if you do it properly, create tension and excitement. The audience accepts them because they know the band is swinging. As long as there's clave'' -- the basic five-stroke pattern of Latin music -- ''and the band is cooking, I can do anything I want to with the number.''
At the National Endowment for the Arts event, Mr. Palmieri is to be inducted by the pianist McCoy Tyner, who played in the groundbreaking Coltrane quartet of the 1960s. In an interview Mr. Tyner, who has also been designated a jazz master, described himself and Mr. Palmieri as kindred spirits, with affinities that are both musical and personal.
''When I met Eddie, he and I were sort of going down a similar road,'' he said. ''He was also influenced by African rhythms, and I think that is where we connected, even before we did some gigs together. Plus, I think he was very very harmonically involved and very creative in that area. And as an arranger, he was an innovator, thoroughly an artist in terms of his ability to deliver this feeling through his concept.''
In recent years Mr. Palmieri, who has won nine Grammy Awards, has recorded several CDs in a Latin jazz style. He has also led a band called La Perfecta II, bringing his career full circle.
''Here's a guy who begins by having a monumental impact on Latin music by bringing in jazz elements and changing the whole direction of that music,'' said Bob Blumenthal, a jazz critic who is a member of the panel that chose Mr. Palmieri for the jazz master honor. ''And then, as time passes, and more jazz artists get acclimated to his concepts, he brings that other realm into jazz. To me, what he really represents is someone drawing on the two cultures in which he grew up, and having an influence on both.''

HEADLINE: With Controls, Britain Allows Hydraulic Fracturing to Explore for Gas

BYLINE: By STANLEY REED; Melissa Eddy contributed reporting from Berlin.

 BODY:
LONDON -- The British government gave the go-ahead Thursday for exploratory hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, to extract natural gas from shale-rock deposits.
Because of the environmental concerns about the controversial technique, which include the risk of water pollution, the government called for stringent controls on fracking. But the decision nonetheless potentially opens the door for a shale gas industry to begin developing in Western Europe, even though many governments on the Continent remain wary. Poland has already allowed big energy companies to do exploratory drilling.
Europe is the world's second-largest gas market, but it is becoming increasingly dependent on expensive imported gas from places like Russia and Algeria.
''Shale gas represents a promising new potential resource for the U.K.,'' Edward Davey, the energy and climate change secretary, said in a statement. ''We are still in the very early stages of shale gas exploration in the U.K., and it is likely to develop slowly.'' 
With the British economy flagging, the government is under pressure from business to encourage the use of natural gas in power generation alongside its large recent commitment to energy sources like offshore wind and nuclear. Those sources are lower emitters of carbon, but costly. The renewables add to electricity costs in Europe, as do the currently high gas prices, which are approximately double those in the United States.
Prices in the United States are lower largely as a result of the increased production of shale gas, despite the opposition of environmentalists.
The gas industry and other interests argue that shale gas, which burns cleaner than coal, could contribute to making gas a logical transition fuel until low-carbon energy sources are sufficiently developed to take over the load. Substantial amounts of shale gas could also help compensate for the decline of oil and gas production in the North Sea, a mainstay of the British economy.
Shale gas ''could contribute significantly to our energy security, reducing our reliance on imported gas as we move to a low-carbon economy,'' Mr. Davey said.
Some European industries are being hurt by high natural gas prices. ''We are seeing energy-intensive industry choosing to invest in the U.S. rather than in Europe,'' said Catherine Robinson, an analyst with the market research firm IHS CERA in London.
Britain, where the government is relatively well disposed to shale gas, is viewed as something of a bellwether. If shale gas catches hold in Britain and there are no major problems, its prospects on the Continent might look better as well.
''We now see the U.K. as the front-runner in this story, along with Poland,'' said Menno Koch, an analyst at Lambert Energy Advisory in London.
But there is strong opposition to shale gas in Europe, particularly in Western Europe. France, for instance, which is viewed as having some of the most promising shale oil and gas prospects, particularly in the Paris area, has banned fracking.
The German state of North Rhine-Westphalia has formally halted the practice, and Exxon Mobil has stopped drilling in Lower Saxony state because of local opposition. On Friday, Germany's upper house of Parliament will vote on legislation that would ban the practice, pending a further, government-led assessment of the risks involved.
The main concerns, which have quickly spread to Europe from the United States, center on hydraulic fracturing, the practice of pumping large quantities of fluids into wells to loosen the rock formations and enable the gas to flow. The fear is that the fracking fluids might escape from the wells and pollute drinking water and the surrounding countryside. Another concern is that the shale gas industry, which requires drilling many wells, is not suited to the densely populated landscapes that characterize much of Western Europe.
''Pinning the U.K.'s energy hopes on an unsubstantiated, polluting fuel is a massive gamble, and consumers and the climate will end up paying the price,'' the environmental group Greenpeace said Thursday in a statement from London.
The group derided the decision as the government's ''dream of building Dallas in Lancashire'' and referred to it as ''a dangerous fantasy.''
Countries in Eastern Europe like Poland, Ukraine and Lithuania are more open to shale gas, both to generate jobs and to ease their dependence on Russian gas. Chevron and Eni of Italy, among other companies, are in the early stages of exploratory drilling in Poland. Bulgaria, another Eastern European country thought to have shale gas potential, has put a moratorium on exploration.
The British government is putting in place a system designed to shut down any fracturing operation before it can cause damage. It is also setting up an Office of Unconventional Gas and Oil, to monitor and potentially aid the development of the new industry.
The decision in Britain on Thursday is encouraging for a handful of companies interested in exploring for shale gas in the country. That includes, most notably, Cuadrilla Resources, which has already spent tens of millions of dollars on a handful of shale gas wells in the Blackpool area of northwestern England. Cuadrilla is backed by the American private equity firm Riverstone Holdings, whose European chief is John Browne, the former chief executive of the oil giant BP. Mr. Browne is also chairman of Cuadrilla's board.
Cuadrilla's chief executive, Francis Egan, said in a statement, ''Today's news is a turning point for the country's energy future.''
Cuadrilla set back the shale gas cause in Britain and Europe when fracking on one of its wells set off two small earthquakes in April and May 2011. A subsequent study commissioned by the British government found that the fracking fluid had destabilized a fault in the earth, causing it ''to fail repeatedly in a series of small earthquakes.''
The tremors did some damage to the well but did not compromise its integrity and were not strong enough to cause structural damage outside, the study said. But the government said Thursday that it had concluded ''that the seismic risks associated with fracking can be managed effectively with controls.''
Cuadrilla ceased fracking operations after the quakes, although it has been doing preparatory drilling at a site called Anna's Road.
Mr. Egan said that based on Cuadrilla's work, the company thought there could be 200 trillion cubic feet of shale gas in the thick rock layers beneath the company's 347-square-mile concession in Lancashire. If only 10 percent were recoverable, that could be enough gas to supply Britain for around seven years.
Whether gas will flow in commercial quantities has yet to be established, although the early tests were encouraging. To find out, Cuadrilla wants to fracture at least three wells, some of which have already been drilled.
Before it starts fracking, Cuadrilla still needs to clear various hurdles, including getting local permission. A Cuadrilla spokesman, Neil Cameron, said that the earliest the company was likely to be able to go ahead was in March.
Fracking is likely to stir opposition from environmental activists. Last year three people from a small group called Frack Off entered a Cuadrilla site and chained themselves to the equipment. They were found guilty of trespassing and fined. Frack Off says it worries that huge swaths of the British Isles will be opened up to various types of mineral exploitation, including shale gas and coal bed methane, another unconventional gas technique.
''This now threatens our landscape, and local people are going to be in the firing line,'' Andrew West, a Frack Off campaigner, said by telephone. ''The resistance is growing.''

HEADLINE: Promise vs. Reality in Newark on Mayor's Watch

BYLINE: By KATE ZERNIKE

 BODY:
NEWARK -- When snow blanketed this city two Christmases ago, Mayor Cory A. Booker was celebrated around the nation for personally shoveling out residents who had appealed for help on Twitter. But here, his administration was scorned as streets remained impassable for days because the city had no contract for snow removal.
Last spring, Ellen DeGeneres presented Mr. Booker with a superhero costume after he rushed into a burning building to save a neighbor. But Newark had eliminated three fire companies after the mayor's plan to plug a budget hole failed.
In recent days, Mr. Booker has made the rounds of the national media with his pledge to live on food stamps for a week. But his constituents do not need to be reminded that six years after the mayor came into office vowing to make Newark a ''model of urban transformation,'' their city remains an emblem of poverty. 
Cory Booker's promise -- captured in two books, two documentaries and frequent television appearances -- was to save a city that had been hemorrhaging residents, industry and hope since the riots that ripped it apart 45 years ago. But a growing number of Newarkers complain that he has proved to be a better marketer than mayor, who shines in the spotlight but shows little interest in the less-glamorous work of what it takes to run a city.
Now, the mayor is openly weighing whether to step up to a bigger stage. The 43-year-old former Rhodes scholar with a national reputation enjoyed by few mayors said he would decide this month whether to challenge Gov. Chris Christie, which would create a marquee race between two high-wattage candidates, each a rising star in his party.
This troubled city, with its deep, systemic problems, was always an unlikely political springboard. And few people deny Mr. Booker's accomplishments, particularly compared with those of his predecessor, Sharpe James, who went to federal prison for corruption. Mr. Booker has reduced the city's structural deficit. Downtown has had a building boom, including the city's first two hotels, and the city's first new supermarket in decades has opened in the Central Ward.
''They were attracted by the public persona of Booker, the clean-government attitude that he projects throughout the country,'' said Frank Giantomasi, a development lawyer whose firm moved here from the suburbs in the hope of helping the city's rebirth. ''I think he's done a fabulous job of telling people what Newark can be and what Newark is right now.''
But even some fellow New Jersey Democrats who believe that Mr. Booker is their best chance to oust Mr. Christie, a Republican, say he should run for Frank R. Lautenberg's Senate seat in 2014, arguing that Mr. Booker is better suited to speechmaking in Washington than to governing a state.
A Stanford- and Yale-educated son of the suburbs, Mr. Booker arrived to suspicion when he moved into the Newark projects and made his unsuccessful first run for mayor. Lately, though, criticism has come even from those he won over: people working on the education projects he supports, council members who ran on his reform slate, business leaders and families who believed in his promise to bring ''a renaissance for the rest of us'' to a city plagued by self-dealing and mismanagement.
They say Mr. Booker's frequent Twitter posts to his 1.3 million followers, his appearances on television and at gatherings of moguls and celebrities -- he was out of town nearly a quarter of the time between January 2011 and June 2012, according to The Star-Ledger -- have distracted him from the local trench work needed to push his agenda. Business leaders say he dazzles at news conferences, but flags on the follow-through. Residents have wearied of the outside fascination for the mayor whom Oprah Winfrey called ''a rock star'' and Jon Stewart on Wednesday referred to as ''the superhero mayor of Newark.''
Taxes have risen more than 20 percent over the past three years, even after the city laid off about 1,100 workers, including more than 160 police officers. Crime has risen, and unemployment is up. Schools remain under state control, and the city's finances remain so troubled that it cannot borrow to fix its antiquated water system. While new restaurants have risen near the Prudential Center downtown, those in the outer wards were placed under a curfew this year because of shootings and drug dealing.
''There's a lot of frustration and disappointment,'' said Assemblyman Albert Coutinho, a Democrat representing Newark. ''People feel that the mayor basically is out of the city too much and doesn't focus much on the day-to-day.
''In fairness, he has had some tremendous success as a result of those travels, but the reality is, a city needs its mayor, needs to see its mayor on a regular basis. It makes people feel that the issues that are important to them are important enough for their mayor to come spend time with them.''
''While he genuinely does care for the citizens of Newark,'' Mr. Coutinho added, ''a lot of people here feel that he's been looking beyond Newark for a long time.''
Mr. Booker defends the time he spends away from the city, saying his networking has brought as much as $400 million in philanthropic contributions to the city, including a $100 million donation to the schools from Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook. ''No city has had the kind of renewal we have had, in the worst economy since the 1950s,'' the mayor said.
He chafes at being portrayed as anything but hands-on: ''Few mayors are more on the ground and responsive to individual constituent complaints than I am.''
Mr. Christie's advisers are well aware of the charge that the mayor has not lived up to very high expectations, and so doubt that Mr. Booker will run. Though the state has far more Democrats than Republicans, recent polls show Mr. Christie, who has had a surge in popularity since Hurricane Sandy, would receive 53 percent of the votes, and Mr. Booker roughly 35 percent.
The two have an unusually good relationship, even filming a video parody together, but the political benefits have not been enjoyed equally. Mr. Booker provided bipartisan backing for the governor's plan for pension and benefit cuts to government workers. But when the state reached a landmark contract agreement with Newark teachers, Mr. Booker was not invited to stand with other officials to make the announcement.
While Mr. Christie has held scores of town-hall-style meetings in his strategy of ''governing on the offensive,'' Mr. Booker has been far less aggressive in selling his proposals, most critically a 2010 plan to create an authority to control the city's water system, which would have helped close a $180 million budget gap.
When opponents of the plan packed churches and neighborhood meetings, Mr. Booker made almost no effort to counter them, said members of the Municipal Council who were elected on Mr. Booker's platform. That failure forced 866 layoffs, a 16 percent property tax increase and the sale of 16 city buildings, including Symphony Hall and police and fire headquarters.
Similarly, one of his biggest education initiatives -- to allow charter schools to pay rent and about $50 million in maintenance to share buildings with schools where the student population had plummeted -- was voted down after strong opposition in 2011.
The school superintendent, appointed by Mr. Christie, overrode the vote by the school board. But proponents of the plan criticized the mayor for running to the state for cover, even as he has said he wants Newark schools to be controlled locally.
''How come you can't persuade the people who elected you twice?'' said one person who shares the mayor's ideas on how to overhaul schools. ''When's the last time you did a town hall? Why do we have to go to Twitter to find out what you're talking about?''
The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because of fear of retaliation from the Booker administration.
Asked about complaints from residents and business owners that garbage is not picked up, abandoned buildings are not boarded up and public spaces are in disrepair, the mayor talked about a new system that allows him to track which streets need snowplows and which departments are paying for too much overtime -- even when he is out of town.
He invited a reporter to see the system in action. He then called to apologize that he could not be there: ''I'm in and out of New York all day.''
Instead, his staff demonstrated the system. Mr. Booker was on his way to host a reading at a bookstore on the Upper West Side, filmed by C-Span. He then spoke at a benefit at Cipriani and attended a movie premiere at Google's New York headquarters. Afterward, he announced on Twitter, ''I sat on a panel with @Richard Branson last night for the premiere of this film about the failure of the war on drugs http://wayw.re/TGYU6Z''

HEADLINE: Down the Shore, The Lost and the Found

BYLINE: By HELENE STAPINSKI

 BODY:
ASBURY PARK, N.J. -- I'm riding down Kingsley, looking for a place to park. With the crowds at Convention Hall, the Stone Pony and the Wonder Bar, there are no spots left on this oceanfront stretch. I'm here to see the roller-derby championship, three weeks after Hurricane Sandy ripped through and devoured the boardwalk. It's night, and a waxing moon barely lights the culprit -- the churning Atlantic, which both gives this place its life and threatens its existence.
Inside Convention Hall it's almost easy to forget what's happened. The cast of ''Scrooge'' is dressed in period costume, handing out fliers. The winter bazaar stalls are doing a swift business. And the cover band playing at the tree-lighting ceremony is loud enough to drown out thoughts of FEMA and insurance agents.
''Everybody's here tonight, checking in with each other,'' said Tom Gilmour, the city's director of commerce and economic development, gesturing to his exhausted but smiling neighbors. It seems the whole city -- including the mayor -- is in this one enormous room. Some have even brought their dogs. ''People think the whole shore is just washed away,'' Mr. Gilmour said. ''But we're here.'' 
People who've spent any time at the Jersey Shore are taking a mental inventory these days of the places they've loved, hoping they haven't lost them. I grew up in Jersey City, but every phase of my life has had its shore moments. And so Asbury, the first place I went with my family each summer weekend, is first on my list.
After Sandy hit, Asbury considered canceling the Jersey Shore Roller Girls Championship, which traditionally follows the tree lighting. There was a foot of sand in Convention Hall, and the track, stored in a building on the boardwalk, was covered in ocean grit.
''But a lot of the girls wanted to do it, even though they lost their homes, their jobs,'' said Kim Hartman, a member of the Right Coast Rollers. ''The derby, once you do it, kind of gets into your soul. We thought, we've lost so much, let's not lose the derby too.'' Before the championship the bruised roller girls -- with nicknames like Wicked Kitty and Shermaine Tank -- put on hip waders and spent 16 hours power-washing their track. ''Sandy took us down,'' said Ms. Hartman, a k a Bash N. Onya, ''but it didn't knock us out.''
When you first revisit the Jersey Shore, the damage is shocking. But amid the demolished boardwalks and toppled buildings, including the apocalyptic vision that is oceanfront Belmar, it's also a shock to see how much is still standing.
Madam Marie's, the tiny shack made famous in Bruce Springsteen's song ''4th of July, Asbury Park (Sandy)'' is still here on the boardwalk. The door blew off, but other than that the psychic headquarters of Asbury is fine. The Great Auditorium in Ocean Grove -- a gorgeous 118-year-old hulking wooden structure that houses the Hope Jones pipe organ, one of the 20 largest in the world -- had some roof damage, but survived. Last weekend the town celebrated its Victorian Holiday weekend, which included the auditorium's live Nativity made up of local children. The boardwalk there is now like a roller coaster, rising up and then falling gently back down.
My favorite restaurant in Bradley Beach, Vic's, with its neon lights and snug green booths, is packed and has been since it reopened a week after the storm. The owner, Ed Dollive, whose family has run the place since 1947, has fielded hundreds of calls from concerned customers. ''They're still calling,'' Mr. Dollive said.
John Amick of Butler, N.J., sharing a large pie and Vic's trademark chopped antipasto with his wife and her cousins, said he and everyone he knew had been Googling their favorite haunts. ''But with one eye open,'' he said. ''You're afraid of what you're going to find.''
D'Jais, the Belmar club where I drank Jell-O shots in my early 20s, is one of the few places along that oceanfront strip upright. Though it'll need to be gutted, the owner plans to open by May and is trying to salvage the dance floor. The Breakers on the Ocean in Spring Lake, which suffered some wind damage, is already open, as is the Porch in nearby Spring Lake Heights, which served only cold beer and deep fried food from its gas-fueled fryer while the electricity was out. In badly damaged Lake Como you can still get a drink at Bar Anticipation -- Bar A to regulars -- an indoor-outdoor club where in the 1990s I once waited for a rumored drop-in Springsteen performance. (He never showed.)
Heading south, things get worse. Point Pleasant is a strange mix of the destroyed and the amazingly hopeful. Jersey Mike's Subs -- the national chain that got its start here -- has been feeding hungry legions of distraught homeowners since the Friday after the storm, when the franchise owner, Jim Van Nostrand, ran out and bought a generator. Nothing else was open yet, so the lines snaked out the door. The corporate office in Manasquan arranged to feed thousands of displaced and ravaged residents from Keansburg to Mantoloking, all free. Though a hoagie is not going to remove the stunned look of loss in everyone's eyes, it certainly doesn't hurt.
Nearby, the aquarium at Jenkinson's Boardwalk, where I've taken my kids many times, was battered, but survived. Eight staff members stayed through the storm to take care of the sharks, penguins and fish. They watched the ocean surge under the building and out to the street. The veterinarian's office, quarantine room and some holding tanks in the basement were lost, but none of the animals -- or their keepers -- were hurt. Aside from the neon sign out front, which was destroyed and scattered along the boardwalk, the rest of the building was solid. The aquarium is expected to be open sometime in January, around the same time as the Sweet Shop, the Pavilion Arcade and Jenks nightclub.
Every fall Jenkinson's puts its amusement park rides in storage, so by the time Sandy hit most of the attractions were safely ensconced -- the Tilt-a-Whirl cars, the Dizzy Dragons, the Himalaya. When people first saw pictures of Jenkinson's, there were no rides, so they assumed they were demolished. That's not the case.
The tracks for the rides were left outside on the boardwalk, now waiting for inspectors to come and give them the green light for their usual Easter opening.
Piles of ruined stuffed animals from the game booths lay abandoned, the Putt-Putt mini-golf building was toppled, and the tiki bar was scattered along the coast, but the sound of hammers and power tools is starting to drown out the eerie silence. The giant lemon from the lemonade stand is unscathed, as is the bathhouse and the Tornado roller coaster.
The same family that runs Jenkinson's owns the Casino Pier in Seaside Heights. They offered to take me for a ride. The carousel, just off the street end of the boardwalk, looks perfectly normal and could be operating by Easter. The Kohr's ice cream stand is boarded up, but O.K. As you make your way to the end of the ragged boardwalk, however, you realize what's missing.
Down below sits the Jet Star roller coaster, whose sister coaster I rode repeatedly in the summer of 1978. As is well known, it's in the ocean now, along with several other rides. Though I've seen the news coverage, seeing the Jet Star three stories beneath me made me feel ill. Stillwalk Manor, the haunted mansion ride, is just gone. One of its cars washed up 10 miles north in Point Pleasant. The Musik Express, a Himalaya-like ride, is a tangled mess of metal on the beach. But right across from it all the Aztec Ocean Resort, where I stayed that whole magical August when I was 13 years old, rises up, its bottom windows boarded, its slanted upper windows and balcony staring defiantly out at the sea.
On Long Beach Island, where my husband and I courted 20 years ago, just a handful of places are open. It's off-season, so not many places would be operating anyway. All along Bay Avenue piles of furniture and drywall sit, a scene that repeats itself from town to town, over and over, like a chorus to some unbearably sad song. But the Fantasy Island Ferris wheel stands guard, with a sign outside that reads, ''Sandy, you'll never stop our summer.''
In Harvey Cedars there's a white sign in front of Neptune Market, home of the Nooney burger: ''We're cooking. Open!'' Seated at the counter inside is a mix of locals and workers here to fix the island. An elevator repairman is dining at the market for the first time because he's heard how great it is. And the sand-removal guy, who grew up around the corner and still lives there, jumps up while eating his sandwich when the fire alarm sounds. He's part of the fire department, and says he rescued dozens of people during Sandy.
Albert Holl, the deli's owner, was one of the first islanders to reopen after the storm. He and his wife, Teri, figured they would offer free coffee and cake. ''But people came in and wanted sandwiches right away,'' he said, laughing at the memory, so he used a portable grill to feed the town. ''We were lucky. Our only problem has been getting enough meat to make enough sandwiches.'' Mr. Holl usually closes from January to March, but this year he's decided to stay open, to help the locals, feed the workers and keep his staff employed.
It's a Wednesday night, a month after the storm, so the moon is full again, like it was when Sandy hit. I'm out with my best friend from elementary school, Marybeth McGovern, who watched the waters rise from her second-floor bedroom in Port Monmouth, a raft and oars at her side. The $75,000 damage to her home has her a bit depressed, but she's ready for a night out.
We go to one of her favorite places in nearby Highlands, Bahrs Landing, the seafood shrine that marks the beginning of the Jersey Shore for many people. Frank Sinatra and the cast of ''The Sopranos'' have all passed under its famous giant lobster sign, which miraculously survived the storm.
Bahrs, built from a beached houseboat, got its start in 1917, feeding stranded sailors after a severe northeaster. Over the years the houseboat was expanded and raised up higher and higher, which helped save it from Sandy. Though the bottom floor was flooded, the rest of the place looks as wonderfully nautical as ever. When he answers the phone, Jay Cosgrove, the owner -- great-grandson of the founders -- does not say hello. He says: ''Bahrs Landing. We're still standing.''
After a dinner of steamers and shrimp scampi Marybeth and I rush over to Red Bank to the Count Basie Theater. Red Bank is jumping, its bars and restaurants overflowing. The Molly Pitcher Inn rises sturdy and majestic a few blocks down.
Kenny and Suzanne Sherman, displaced residents from Staten Island, have driven here from their temporary home in Marine Park in Brooklyn. They've come all this way -- as we have -- to see the Brian Setzer Orchestra.
''I said we have to go and forget about all our worries,'' Mr. Sherman explained, a look of reluctant hope on his troubled face. ''I've seen this band before, and if anything's going to bring people out of their funk, it's this.''
As soon as the 18-piece band hits the stage, led by Mr. Setzer with his glittering red guitar, the sheer power of the brass knocks any residual gloom right out of the room. There is no mention of Sandy, only joyful, rapturous music. That awful glaze in everyone's eyes is replaced with a temporary -- but palpable -- light. Marybeth, who up until now couldn't even think about putting Christmas lights up in her battered house, has suddenly reconsidered.
By the time the band gets to ''Rock This Town,'' the crowd is in an absolute frenzy, screaming, clapping and forgetting the carnage -- at least for tonight.

HEADLINE: Workers' Paradise Lost

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. SUGRUE. 
Thomas J. Sugrue, a professor of history and sociology at the University of Pennsylvania, is the author of ''The Origins of the Urban Crisis: Race and Inequality in Postwar Detroit.''

 BODY:
Philadelphia
THE 211 Bar and Grill is a little watering hole near Michigan's Black Lake, in a place that natives call ''up north.'' Its walls are adorned with prizewinning pike, deer heads, even a wolverine. But its most striking ornament is a patch of wall where visiting autoworkers proudly scrawl their union affiliations: ''Fighting Local 600.'' ''Local 22 -- Hamtramck.''
That wall testifies to more than 75 years of union power in Michigan. Given that history, many were surprised this week when Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, signed legislation preventing unions from forcing workers to pay dues. But, in fact, it's been a long time since Michigan was a workers' paradise. 
The 211 Bar opened in 1946, a turning point for labor. That year saw one of the greatest strike waves in American history, and the United Automobile Workers elected the indomitable Walter P. Reuther its president. By 1950, he had forged the ''treaty of Detroit,'' ushering in an era of prosperity. Autoworkers won decent wages, health insurance, unemployment benefits and a pension plan. Unionization benefited nonunion workers too, because even nonunion employers needed to offer higher pay and benefits to compete with union pay packets.
Unionized workers used their wages and benefits to become homeowners. They could put their kids through college. They did not have to fret about bankruptcy when a medical crisis struck. They were cushioned against the scourge of cyclical unemployment.
And they could even get a taste of the good life, buying little summer cottages and hunting cabins in places like Black Lake. In the 1960s, the U.A.W. even built its retreat and conference center there.
Michigan's unions, which at their height represented 45 percent of the state's workers, became a powerful political force. Detroit's Labor Day parade was a mandatory stop for Democratic presidential candidates (though, tellingly, President Obama skipped it in 2012).
Labor leaders advised Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson. Reuther stood with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on behalf of racial equality (even though some rank-and-file white unionists were skeptical), and he worked with Kennedy and Johnson to expand education, antipoverty and health care programs.
On the state level, even Republicans could not disregard unions. Gov. George Romney, who came to politics as a former auto industry executive, supported Michigan's 1965 law giving collective bargaining rights to public employee unions.
That influence and prosperity were hard won -- and fragile. No sooner did labor gain political clout than its opponents began trying to curb its power. In 1947, a coalition of pro-business Republicans and Southern Democrats pushed through the Taft-Hartley Act, which allowed states to pass right-to-work laws. Within two decades 19 states, all in the South and Mountain West, had right-to-work laws.
Low union density allowed these Sunbelt states to attract employers in search of low wages and weak regulations. Job flight -- first to nonunion states, then to low-wage bastions overseas -- hit hard, especially in Michigan. Union membership dropped to 17.6 percent of Michigan's work force in 2011. In comparison, anti-union and early right-to-work states like Alabama and Arizona had higher union density in 1964 than Michigan today.
Meanwhile, income inequality has spiked, middle-class wages have barely improved and blue-collar jobs are lower paying, less secure and less likely to offer health care and pension benefits. It's no coincidence that incomes have stagnated as union power has waned: the historian Colin Gordon found that inequality had been greatest in right-to-work states and that declining union membership accounted for a third of the rise in inequality during the 1980s and '90s.
Today, unions face high obstacles to organizing, from corporate anti-union campaigns to weak enforcement of labor laws. The strike, once crucial to union bargaining power, is now inconsequential: it depends on community support, which is hard to muster when fewer than a fifth of a state's workers are in unions.
This doesn't mean Michigan's unions are powerless. But they have used their dwindling resources to influence elections and shape policies like taxation, health care and infrastructure spending, rather than confronting employers directly. At a moment when the voting machine has replaced the picket line as the last bastion of union strength, right-to-work advocates hope to weaken what remains of the movement's clout. Without a strong voice representing them, Michigan workers will remain outmatched in what was already a tough defensive battle for economic security.
In Michigan, it's no longer a given that a blue-collar job is a ticket to the middle class. The scribbled names on the 211 Bar wall might well be the last traces of the disappearing world of the once prosperous Michigan worker.

HEADLINE: China Said to Weigh Plan to Deal With Failed Banks

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- China's new leadership is preparing to introduce bank deposit insurance as the first step in financial reforms to be started soon at a top-level meeting in Beijing, a government official and banking policy advisers said.
A consensus has formed among China's leaders that the country needs a formal system of bank deposit insurance as banks have rapidly ramped up lending and begun offering a wide variety of increasingly risky investment products that do not appear on their balance sheets, the official and advisers said.
Introducing deposit insurance could also help the government steer the financial system toward providing more credit for small and medium-size private enterprises. These now receive as little as 3 percent of bank lending even as they account for at least half the country's economic activity.
Without a clear system until now for closing banks that lend unwisely, banks have been encouraged by regulators to lend overwhelmingly to state-owned enterprises that appear certain to repay loans. That has left smaller businesses and private companies starved for credit. 
The first public indication of the government's intense interest in deposit insurance is likely to come at the Central Economic Work Conference this month, said the official, who discussed internal government matters only on the condition of anonymity. Held each December since 1994, the conference is the most important economic policy-making event in the Chinese calendar and sets the agenda for the coming year.
This month's conference, the exact dates of which are still secret but which could start as soon as this weekend, is being watched with particular scrutiny by economists and investors as a clue to the agenda for the next decade of Xi Jinping, the new general secretary of the Communist Party. The conference is jointly overseen by the cabinet and by the Central Committee of the Communist Party.
Mr. Xi startled many analysts by rushing down to Shenzhen in southern China last weekend for an inspection tour of the city, known within China for its embrace of free-market capitalism. He is following in the footsteps of Deng Xiaoping, who restarted China's economic liberalization after the Tiananmen Square crackdown in 1989 with a trip three years later to the same city.
Until now, the government has quietly paid off all depositors in full, regardless of the size of their deposits, when small banks and rural cooperatives have failed; no large banks have been allowed to fail. The government's fear has been that allowing any depositors to sustain losses, even at the worst-run institutions, would undermine confidence in the financial system.
China's banking industry is divided on the need for deposit insurance. As in other countries, including the United States, the biggest banks are the least enthusiastic. With a little more than half the country's deposits, China's Big Four banks are widely viewed as much too big to fail but are likely to owe hefty premiums for the deposit insurance plan being developed.
''The debate over the deposit insurance scheme is that the larger banks that would contribute more feel as though they would be subsidizing smaller banks,'' said Andrew Sheng, a former head of Hong Kong's securities regulator who for the last 10 years has been the convener of the international advisory council of the China Banking Regulatory Commission.
China's current five-year plan calls for the government to study deposit insurance, but not necessarily to adopt it. Mr. Sheng expressed surprise when told that the subject was likely to be on the agenda of the Central Economic Work Conference and said that ''it means that they are taking it more seriously.''
But Mr. Sheng cautioned that even once the leadership approves the concept of deposit insurance, it could take a full year just to draft the necessary legislation.
Charlene Chu, a specialist in Chinese banks in the Beijing office of Fitch Ratings, said that the introduction of deposit insurance could help address the very rapid increase in credit in China relative to the size of the economy.
Responding to orders from the Communist Party, Chinese banks this autumn have lent heavily for infrastructure projects. This has helped stop, at least temporarily, the sharp economic slowdown of last summer, but at the price of increasing stresses in the Chinese financial system.
Chinese households and businesses have become increasingly leery of bank deposits that carry extremely low, regulated interest rates. So banks have offered much less regulated trusts that offer higher interest rates, and have then turned around and offered riskier loans at higher interest rates to cover their extra interest costs.
Trust loans nearly tripled last month compared with those a year earlier, to 200 billion renminbi ($32 billion). That is still less than regular bank loans, at 523 billion renminbi ($84 billion). But many experts worry that bank customers assume the trust investments carry the same implicit government guarantee as regular bank deposits.
The government has not clearly told the public otherwise but is expected to do so as part of any deposit insurance plan.
The usual argument against introducing deposit insurance is that it creates a moral hazard problem: banks may start lending recklessly and growing too swiftly if depositors trust them absolutely with their money because of government guarantees.
But China's current practice of paying off all deposits at failed institutions anyway, for fear of social instability from street protests by any depositors who are not reimbursed, means that deposit insurance might actually reduce moral hazard at Chinese banks, many experts contend.
The introduction of deposit insurance would cap reimbursements for each account at some fixed amount. So banks that want to attract depositors with larger sums of money might choose to pursue more prudent lending policies. Still unclear are the limits that the Chinese government will set for insuring deposits. In the United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation guarantees up to $250,000 for each depositor at each financial institution. It also has an unlimited guarantee on zero-interest checking accounts through the end of this year, a temporary policy introduced in response to the recent global financial crisis.
But most countries set lower limits, and China is expected to do so as well.
Mr. Sheng said that the F.D.I.C.'s ability to close banks without undermining confidence in the financial system was an inspiration for Chinese officials. ''This financial crisis has proven that the F.D.I.C. works, particularly that small financial institutions can exit without disruption to the financial system,'' he said.
In addition to deposit insurance, Mr. Xi's new administration is also looking at the possibility of combining the country's banking, securities and insurance regulators into a single financial regulatory commission, said a businessman with close government connections who also spoke on the condition he not be identified by name.
The administration is also studying a possible move to upgrade the country's central bank, the People's Bank of China, the businessman added. It is currently one of the politically weakest and least independent central banks among the world's leading economies.
Both of these administrative moves, if they won a consensus in the new administration, would be subject to the approval of the National People's Congress in March.

HEADLINE: Revenue Up, Deficit Falls: Fiscal Cliff Gets Credit

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
Let us pause to give credit where credit is due.
The so-called fiscal cliff, and Washington deadlock, dominate the news these days, but the reality is that Congress has accomplished a lot. Thanks to it, as well as to President Obama, action has been taken that will accomplish the following goals:
¶ Provide immediate economic stimulus through the payment of billions of dollars to American individuals.
¶ Significantly increase tax receipts in the current fiscal year, thus reducing the budget deficit, with much of the money coming from higher-income Americans who will voluntarily take steps to increase their 2012 income tax liability. 
¶ Bolster charitable giving substantially this year.
¶ Demonstrate which companies rolling in cash have attained that status by keeping profits overseas, rather than bringing them home to reinvest.
Many of those accomplishments could be limited, however, if President Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner accomplish what everyone says they want -- a quick compromise to avoid the automatic tax increases and spending cuts set to begin Jan. 1 -- and so reduce the uncertainty that is having such beneficial effects.
Each day that passes without a deal brings more companies declaring special dividends, and more high-flying stocks being sold off to capture capital gains that will be taxed at today's low rates. Tax advisers for wealthy people who have some control over the timing of their income are advising them to take the income now, rather than to defer it to next year.
Among the companies that have declared special dividends in the last few weeks are HCA, once known as Hospital Corporation of America; Costco, the retailer; and a clothing company whose name neatly symbolizes the spirit of this holiday season: Guess Inc.
The guessing concerns the shape of tax law next year. I cannot recall a December with more uncertainty about the following year. The fact that the stock market is up this month, albeit only a little, should remind us that the cliché ''investors hate uncertainty'' is nonsense. There is always uncertainty, but sometimes there are reasons to think things will work out well.
One virtual certainty is that taxes on capital gains and dividends are going up for high-income people -- the very people who get most of those types of income. Each is now taxed at 15 percent. At a minimum, the Medicare payroll tax is to be extended to all taxable income over $250,000 for couples and $200,000 for individuals, and raised -- for them only -- to 3.8 percent on that excess income.
But it could be much worse for people who get a lot of that income. If the Bush tax cuts simply expire -- the no-deal case -- the top capital gains rate goes to 20 percent, plus the 3.8 percent topper for the high-income people. Dividends lose all tax preferences. They will then be taxed at ordinary income tax rates, which will rise as high as 39.6 percent, plus that 3.8 percent.
You can see the impact of that in the stock market. At the end of the year there is usually ''tax loss'' selling, as people liquidate their losers to get tax losses to offset other gains. This year there is ''tax winner'' selling. Most of the stocks in the Standard & Poor's 100 -- basically, the largest companies in the United States -- have risen this month. But five of the six stocks that performed best over the last two years have lost ground, including Apple.
As for dividends, there are extras galore -- Bloomberg has counted $21 billion worth -- not to mention early payments. Many companies decided to accelerate dividends that would normally have been paid in early 2013, and some did more. Oracle decided to push the first three 2013 dividends into this year. Larry Ellison, its founder and chief executive, will have an extra $199 million in dividend income this year.
Not all companies are doing that, of course. Apple, whose balance sheet indicates it is rolling in cash, has not announced any such move. The problem may be that Apple arranges its affairs so that a lot of its profits seem to be overseas. That lets it avoid American corporate taxes until it brings the money home, so paying the money out would force it to pay a lot to Uncle Sam.
Companies can and do take steps to make profits show up where taxes are low, regardless of the reality. A couple of years ago, I bought a computer and a few other things by calling Apple's toll-free phone number. Sounds like a United States transaction, right? Probably not. My credit card was billed for two different transactions. The computer was charged separately, and was shipped to my home directly from China. Want to guess where Apple booked the bulk of the profit?
The ''tax winner'' and ''accelerated dividend'' strategies will bolster federal income tax receipts substantially in the current fiscal year, and thus lower the deficit. They will also get cash into the hands of many investors, including some who are not in the top 1 percent and might actually spend the money. That will provide economic stimulus.
And you thought Congress had done nothing to help.
Partly offsetting those moves are the increases in charitable deductions -- a trend that at first seems counterintuitive. If a charitable deduction in 2013 will save you more in taxes than a similar deduction this year -- as it will if tax rates go up -- why not hold off and send that check on Jan. 1 rather than Dec. 31?
The answer is that there is fear that the deduction might vanish next year, or at least shrink. Mitt Romney started the talk about putting a cap on deductions, and it has gained some traction politically. That won't affect most of us, but colleges and charities are busy warning their big donors that they might be better off fulfilling that multiyear pledge now, before limits come in.
All of these one-year diversions will not be important in the long term, although the fact that earnings are being accelerated into 2012 means that earnings, and tax bills, may appear to decline in 2013 even if the economy continues to improve.
In the longer term, the challenges facing the United States were laid out nicely this week by Mervyn A. King, the departing governor of the Bank of England, in a speech to the Economics Club of New York. He was speaking about his own country, but he might as well have been talking about this one.
The first goal, he said, is to avoid having austerity derail economic recovery. Then comes the need to get national finances in order over the long term.
A McClatchy-Marist poll released this week showed the extent of wishful thinking in this country. Sizable majorities of both Republicans and Democrats say they want compromises to be made and think it is important that a deal be reached before the end of this year.
Democrats, as you would expect, think taxes on the wealthy should go up, and Republicans disagree.
But on virtually every other question, there was bipartisan agreement to avoid anything that sounds like sacrifice. Majorities of both parties say the Bush tax cuts should be continued, at least for all but the rich. Majorities of both parties oppose cuts in Medicare or Medicaid, and they do not want the age at which people become eligible for Medicare to be raised. They want to preserve the home mortgage and charitable deductions.
So far, the American political elite has not faced up to the reality, at least in what they have told their constituents. Raising taxes on the wealthy is not enough, but you haven't heard Mr. Obama say much about the possibility that others may have to pay more. Nor will it be enough to cut spending that Republicans don't like anyway, but Mr. Romney insisted he could balance the budget while sharply increasing military spending.
Perhaps Mr. Boehner and Mr. Obama can reach difficult compromises. But that will never happen if they choose to follow their bases, rather than lead.

HEADLINE: At a Busy Gurgaon Call Center, Putting the Phones on Hold for 'Family Day'

BYLINE: JEN SWANSON


HIGHLIGHT: To attract and keep young talent, outsourcing companies woo their parents. 

 BODY:
On a recent Friday, amid the corporate sprawl of modern Gurgaon, Genpact, one of India's largest business process and technology outsourcing centers, transformed an otherwise nondescript conference room into a festive reception hall with bright balloons, waiters passing out candy and a stage set up for the occasion. Employees trickled in, some new to the company, others veterans with years of experience, to slowly fill the 100-odd chairs in the room. But this afternoon, instead of the notepads and pens they would bring to regular team meeting, these workers have got their families in tow.
Welcome to Family Day, an office open house designed for new hires and their parents, who wonder how their children, particularly the daughters, spend the day. "When this industry began, for the first time it was about women doing evening shifts and night shifts, and you had families very worried about something like that," said Anjali Singh, vice president of human resources and training. "In the Indian culture that wasn't seen so often." 
So about seven years ago, Genpact started hosting Family Day, also known as Family Day Connect, inviting parents and spouses to tour the office and meet the managers, after an icebreaker of music trivia, party favors and sometimes Bollywood dance. Afterwards, dinner is served, a vegetarian buffet of pav bhaji, bhel puri and other Indian favorites. "Some of these things were just to make parents and families feel comfortable with where their daughter or son goes all day," said Ms. Singh. The function is held anywhere from once a quarter to every six months (sometimes more frequently for larger accounts). 
Family days have become an industry standard, according to Roopa Unnikrishnan, founder of Center10 Consulting and senior executive adviser at the Center for Talent Innovation, a New York-based think tank focused on helping corporations leverage talent and diversity in 190 countries, including India. In an environment marked by high turnover, Ms. Unnikrishnan explained, "any company that has to bring on large numbers of young talent and keep them find [family days] to be a hugely attractive, culturally attuned and cost-effective strategy." 
Genpact may not have created the initial concept behind Family Day, but the company became one of India's earliest adopters of the event.
Breaking down work-life barriers benefits the company, too. Ms. Singh said Genpact's annual attrition rate is around 23 percent, a laudable average in an industry notorious for job-hopping. "Because this is India and we listen a lot to our parents, especially when we're younger, if the parents are convinced this is a good place to be, then they're going to encourage their kids to stay there," Ms. Singh said.
A rigorous interview process, referral programs and "dummy" shifts, which offer potential new hires the chance to work a trial shift before signing on, contribute to the low turnover. Later, opportunities for career advancement, mentoring, internal reshuffling and other incentives keep employees engaged. Many Genpact employees also opt to further their studies, taking advantage of subsidized tuition offered through different partnerships with Indian and foreign universities. Some executives go to Harvard or Duke for senior executive courses.
About 10 years ago, the business process outsourcing sector's average rates of attrition hovered around 50 to 60 percent, said Surabhi Mathur-Gandhi, senior vice president of IT sourcing at TeamLease, an Indian recruitment company. Back then, a fledgling sector was so desperate for talent that companies were willing to hire and train candidates without any experience, who were then poached by rival organizations offering greater compensation.
"Since then, the industry has matured to a large extent. Processes have become more stringent, and organizations are less willing to accept candidates without credentials," she said.
Since then, attrition rates have continued to fall, from about 45 percent five years ago to around 20 to 25 percent today, which Ms. Mathur-Gandhi calls a "dramatic improvement" from where the Indian outsourcing sector stood five years ago.
"The industry expects a lot more," she said. While a sluggish economy factors into the improved average since employees are less likely to jump ship, she said, employers are also more discerning in their hiring practices, and those who offer more opportunities for advancement, competitive compensation and other retention techniques to nurture skilled talent enjoy less attrition down the line.
Back at Family Day, Vikas Singhal, a smartly dressed assistant vice president who seems destined for the boardroom, shared his professional journey with the audience, describing how his five years of career progression has culminated in a recent promotion to the head of an account for an important Australian financial client. And as manager to many of the employees in the room, Mr. Singhal thanked the 40-plus families for coming and invited them to ask questions.
One mother raised her hand to ask why their children, who show up at 5 a.m. for work, don't get a free breakfast. (With over 60,000 employees worldwide and about 10,000 employees working in Gurgaon alone, Mr. Singhal explained, it is more expedient to offer meal plans and two subsidized cafeterias). A bespectacled father asked why his son works such long hours. (An eight- or nine-hour day is standard, Mr. Singhal said, but he assured the father that hard workers will be noticed and rewarded.) A faux-hawked teen asked what exactly Genpact does, since his brother sure is tired at the end of the day. (To that, a joke: "We make them work hard for eight hours so when they go home they can have a nice sleep.")
"Security of female employees is always a big question," Mr. Singhal said afterward, but added that parents are usually reassured after touring the facility, an 11-story, twin tower compound where separate wings require individual key card access and security guards are posted to each floor, 24 hours a day. Meanwhile, shuttles run from 7 a.m. to 7 p.m. from the building to the nearest metro station. Private taxis, on contract with the company, are available for anyone working 8 p.m. to 6 a.m., and if there are female passengers, a security guard accompanies them, one employee said.
But Genpact, an equal-opportunity employer, goes beyond just creating a safe space for women; gender diversity is among the company's top priorities, and management actively seeks to foster female talent through mentoring and sponsorship opportunities.
"Women bring in a different thought process," said Ms. Singh, the human resources executive. "If you have a board or a senior leadership team that comprises only of men, versus a team that comprises of men and women, you're going to see that the teams that have women it are more successful."
N.V. "Tiger" Tyagarajan, chief executive and president of Genpact, agreed, calling the company's relatively high number of female employees, around 40 percent companywide and 20 to 25 percent at senior levels, one of the company's competitive advantages.
In 1997, when the young outsourcing company was the back-end office of General Electric, "we borrowed and stole best practices from across the globe," he said. (Genpact became an independent organization in 2005, and G.E. remains a client.) The need to relate to Western culture "is important when you're talking about 10- or 20-year relationships," he said.
But keeping women on the payroll can be a tricky business. Even though Indian women don't face the same pressures to find child care as their Western counterparts, thanks in part to the prevalence of extended families, "Indian women still manage the majority of the domestic effort," said Ms. Singh.
Genpact has identified some critical points when women tend to drop out of the work force - just after marriage, and again in their early to mid-30s, after having a baby or sending the kids to school -- and does its best to be flexible with schedules and workloads rather than lose a valuable employee. One female vice president's husband was transferred to Kenya, Ms. Singh said, where Genpact does not currently have an office, so she'll work remotely from Nairobi until she and her family return to India.
The employee-friendly policies seem to be creating loyal workers, judging by the enthusiastic testimonials at Family Day. "This is the best place to work, especially being female, security-wise, environment-wise," a young woman gushed into the microphone, adding that Genpact's generous culture has made her the envy of all her girlfriends. A young man shared how he felt misplaced when he first started, until his manager helped him find a new role at the company better suited to his qualifications. "People listen to you," he said, grinning at his colleague-turned-wife in the audience.
A third employee, a young woman wearing a white sari who just joined Genpact three months ago, declared her intention to establish a career at the company. "I hope it's not just six months," she said, giggling. "I'm going to spend six years."

HEADLINE: The Trade-Off Between Economic Growth and Deficit Reduction

BYLINE: LAURA D'ANDREA TYSON


HIGHLIGHT: The extremely slow recovery from the recession would be dealt a deadly blow if a rigid austerity plan was imposed on government spending, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Laura D'Andrea Tyson is a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, and served as chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton. 
The economy is continuing to recover from its deepest recession since the Great Depression, but the pace of recovery is frustratingly slow. The question is why, and the answer has profound implications for fiscal policy and for the debate over deficit reduction and economic growth that has transfixed Washington.
Since 2010, annual growth of gross domestic product has averaged about 2.1 percent. This is less than half the average pace of recoveries from previous recessions in the United States since the end of World War II, according to a recent study by the Congressional Budget Office. Both potential G.D.P., a measure of the economy's underlying capacity, and actual G.D.P. have grown unusually slowly compared with previous recovery periods.
Slow G.D.P. growth has meant slow growth in employment. Payroll employment has been expanding at a rate of about 150,000 jobs per month during the last two years, only slightly above the growth of the labor force. Employment growth has been largely consistent with overall G.D.P. growth and with the "jobless" pattern of the 1990-91 and 2001 recoveries. 
In both this recovery and the previous two, the rebound in employment growth has been weaker and later than the rebound in G.D.P. growth. But G.D.P. growth in the current, jobless recovery has been slower. Another salient difference is that the loss of jobs in the most recent recession was more than twice as large as in previous recessions, so a slow recovery has also meant a much higher unemployment rate. 
Why has G.D.P. growth been so tepid compared with previous recoveries? Most economists believe that weak aggregate demand is the primary culprit. The 2008 recession resulted from a systemic financial crisis rooted in an asset bubble that gripped the housing market with particular ferocity. Private sector demand contracts sharply and recovers slowly after such crises. 
The large and persistent decline in private-sector demand that began the 2008 recession and that explains the painfully slow recovery is apparent in the private-sector financial balance - net private saving, the difference between private saving and private investment. 
The private-sector financial balance swung from a deficit of -3.7 percent of G.D.P. in 2006, at the height of the boom, to a surplus of about 6.8 percent in 2010 and about 5 percent today. This represents the sharpest contraction and weakest recovery in private-sector demand in the post-World War II period.
Growth in two components of private demand - consumption and residential investment - has been especially slow in this recovery compared with the average for previous recoveries. This is not surprising. 
Residential investment is still depressed as a result of overbuilding during the 2004-8 housing boom and the tsunami of foreclosures that followed. Large losses in household wealth, deleveraging from excessive debt, weak growth in wages and household income, and a decline in labor's share of national income to a historic low have combined to constrain consumption growth. Wobbly consumer confidence and the concentration of most income gains at the top of the income distribution have also contributed. 
The recovery of business investment demand has followed a different pattern. Indeed, the growth of business investment has been slightly stronger during the current recovery than the average for previous ones. But after plummeting to new lows during the recession, the ratio of net business investment to G.D.P. remains depressed by historical standards. Lower net investment compared with the economy's capital stock is a major reason that the growth rate of potential G.D.P. has been so slow. 
Throughout the recovery, business surveys have identified lackluster customer demand and weak sales prospects as the primary factors holding down business investment. Business confidence has remained subdued as a result of uncertainty about the future growth of markets both at home and abroad and more recently about the future course of United States fiscal policy. 
Limits on credit availability were also significant deterrents to investment, especially by small and medium-size firms at least through 2010, when banks began to ease their commercial loan terms. 
Weak investment demand cannot be explained by low profits and high taxes: the profit share of national income has hit a historic peak and taxes on investment income are at historic lows. 
Another factor contributing to the slow pace of the current recovery relative to previous recoveries has been the relatively weak growth of government spending on goods and services by both state and local governments and by the federal government. 
Indeed, the contraction in state and local government spending and the associated decline in public-sector employment have been major headwinds restraining G.D.P. growth. 
The increase in federal government purchases of goods and services in the 2009 stimulus bill mitigated but did not offset the effects of weak private-sector demand through 2010. But since then, the slowdown in such purchases has been a drag on G.D.P. and employment growth. 
After three years of recovery, the economy is still operating far below its potential and long-term interest rates are hovering near historic lows. Under these circumstances, the case for expansionary fiscal measures, even if they increase the deficit temporarily, is compelling. 
A recent study by the International Monetary Fund finds large positive multiplier effects of expansionary fiscal policy on output and employment under such circumstances.
And more output and employment now would mean higher levels in the future, because stronger demand now would encourage more private investment and stem the loss of skills and productivity resulting from long-term unemployment and the drop in the labor force participation rate. 
The rationale for expansionary fiscal policy is particularly compelling for federal investment spending in areas like education and infrastructure that have large multiplier effects on the current level of output and employment and strong returns over time.
By the same logic, the $600 billion of revenue increases and spending cuts scheduled for next year - the so-called fiscal cliff - would have large negative effects on demand, output and employment and would reduce future potential output as well. 
The fiscal cliff packs a powerful punch: there will be 3.4 million fewer jobs by the end of 2013 if Congress allows these policies to take effect.
The economy does not need an outsize dose of fiscal austerity now; it does need a credible deficit-reduction plan to stabilize the debt-to-G.D.P. ratio gradually as the economy recovers. As I contended in an earlier Economix post, the plan should have an unemployment-rate target or trigger that would postpone deficit-reduction measures until the target is achieved. (In a move that signals its abiding concern about the recovery's strength and resilience, the Federal Reservehas just announced an unemployment-rate target for monetary policy, committing to keep short-term interest rates near zero until the unemployment rate falls to 6.5 percent.)
The goal of deficit reduction is to ensure the economy's long-term growth and stability. 
It would be the height of fiscal folly to kill the economy's painful recovery from the Great Recession in pursuit of this goal.

HEADLINE: Q. and A.: Jeremy Irons and 'Trashed'

BYLINE: JOANNA M. FOSTER


HIGHLIGHT: As the film opens in the United States, its star reflects on consumerism, excess waste and environmental toxins -- and on ways to push back 

 BODY:
Just in time for the holidays, a new documentary about the ultimate fate of just about everything we lug home from the mall opens on Friday in limited release in the United States. "Trashed," directed by Candida Brady and starring Jeremy Irons, delves into the less festive side of consumerism and waste disposal -- overflowing landfills in England, a toxic trash incinerator in Iceland, a hospital for children with birth defects in Vietnam.
We sat down recently with Mr. Irons to talk trash. Following are excerpts, edited for brevity and clarity.
 Q. 
 "Trashed" opens with a powerful image from Lebanon of a mountain of trash stacked high next to the ocean. Can you describe what it was like sitting on that trash mountain? 
 A. 
It was appalling. I've never been so grateful to leave the "set" of a film. It is certainly something to look at, but what people who see the film don't experience is the smell of dead animals and wafting chemicals that make you gag. There are flies and fleas everywhere, stray dogs tripping over rubbish and yapping furiously at the scavenging birds circling overhead.
What really made my stomach turn was watching the steady stream of evil-looking runoff oozing from the bottom of the mountain of garbage straight into the sea. It looks and smells like poison, and there are still fishermen out there, although far fewer than there used to be.

What fish they do catch certainly aren't eating what you or I would care to eat. It was all just horrific, but what's happening there is what happens if you do nothing, and it's an illustration of what we are all doing only they haven't bothered to hide it.
 Q. 
 Has making "Trashed" led you to change any of your personal habits? 
 A. 
Yes. And I don't consider myself an environmentalist or activist -- I'm hardly an expert on green living. But what I've started doing since making the film is that I take packaging off at the point of purchase.
I consider myself quite capable of getting my tomatoes home safely without sitting on them, so why must they come packaged in plastic armor? And I think I can even get a pair of scissors home without chopping off my hand so I really don't need that damned impenetrable plastic shell.
So I take it off and leave it on the counter and ask the person who sold it to me to deal with it themselves, because I didn't want it in the first place. That way we push it back toward the manufacturers because the supermarkets will say: "Look, we can't deal with all of this. Can you please provide less or take it back and reuse it?"
 Q. 
 How do you think waste compares with climate change as an issue? Shouldn't trash be an even more obvious problem that no one can dispute? 
 A. 
It seems pretty obvious when you see a landfill or a the insides of a seabird bursting with plastic fragments. But so much of that is so removed from our everyday lives that it's a bit like climate change and Bangladesh -- out of sight, out of mind.
And just like there are those who dispute the scientific evidence behind climate change, there are those who argue there is no connection between environmental toxins and health. In the documentary we talk to villagers in France living near an incinerator who saw cancer rates spike in their community. They took the government to court over it and were told that there was no proof of any connection. Just like some of the effects of climate change, some of these health effects are still down the pipeline.
Finally, there's also a lot of money in trash, as there is in the fossil fuel industry. In places like New York, it's not just a lack of organization that results in so little being recycled, it's also that there is a huge amount of money in trash disposal. The people who are getting rid of our waste at the moment have a fine industry and have no incentive to change that.
 Q. 
 What practical steps would you recommend to anyone who sees "Trashed" and wants to do something? 
 A. 
Find out in an intelligent way what happens to the waste that leaves your home, and decide whether this is something you approve of. You might be surprised to learn that, especially around New York, much of it is incinerated in areas with poor, disadvantaged communities. Are you O.K. with the poor getting your toxic ash?
If you're not, become a little motivated and write to your Congressman to ask if they think this is acceptable.
I also would like to encourage people to actually buy something. If you don't have a reusable shopping bag, please get one and get a second for a friend or family member. There are kinds that fold up as small as a Ping Pong ball and you can keep it in your purse or briefcase and never have to take a pointless plastic bag home again.
And although you might get a few dirty looks, see what happens if you start taking the packaging off at the point of purchase. Retailers are very sensitive to their customers -- you have the power to let them know what you do and don't like, and they will listen.
 Q. 
 What was the most surprising thing you learned while making the documentary? 
 A. 
I didn't realize that all this nondegradable rubbish and consumerism is in large part thanks to World War II and the massive war production apparatus that needed to be developed for peaceful purposes after the days of making weapons had ended. I was born in 1948, so it's really only in my lifetime that this throwaway society has emerged.
I do remember a time before plastic bags when there was just a lot less of everything. I'm still a bit shocked when I walk down Main Street and see all this stuff in the windows. Who buys it all? How could you ever find the time to wear or use it all?
Maybe I'm just getting old, and I know that buying things doesn't make you happy. But I feel like there's a new social mood, maybe because of the economic crisis, more of us are reflecting on what we really need and what we can do without.
 Q. 
 The Christmas shopping season is in full swing. What would you like to say to people as they head out to the mall or load up their Amazon shopping cart? 
 A. 
Don't buy people something they don't need, let alone don't want. Send them a kind message. I know we're all supposed to keep on buying to get the economy going, but most of us don't need very much -- and in my opinion there is nothing like a lovely pair of warm socks or a good bar of soap.

HEADLINE: How Big Is the Budget Hole?

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Not as big as everyone thinks. 

 BODY:
Something I've been meaning to write: get into a discussion of matters fiscal, especially with conservatives, and you're bound to have somebody declaring that we have a ONE TRILLION DOLLAR deficit, which means that what Americans want from their government is far more than we can pay for, so we must slash the welfare state, etc.. Also, that the hole is so big that taxing the rich can't possibly make any real difference (although somehow savaging the poor supposedly will). 
So I think it's worth pointing out just how misleading all this is.
Yes, we do have a trillion-dollar deficit. But a large part of that deficit is attributable to the depressed economy. Reasonable estimates say that we have an output gap of something like $900 billion a year -- yes, some would dispute that, but it's the estimate I find most convincing. This automatically raises the budget deficit by depressing revenue and leading to more spending on unemployment insurance and means-tested programs like Medicaid -- the CBO doesn't offer a simple ratio on this, but a survey of their estimates suggests that we're probably looking at $300 billion or more in automatic stabilizers here. Then you need to add in non-automatic but nonetheless cyclically-determined things like extended unemployment benefits and the temporary payroll tax cut. The point is that economic recovery would shrink the budget deficit a lot -- almost surely more than $400 billion.
Meanwhile, zero is not the crucial number for the deficit; a much better criterion is the budget balance that would, on a sustained basis, stabilize debt as a percentage of GDP. Now, debt is currently slightly over 70 percent of GDP; with 2 percent growth and 2 percent inflation, that means that a deficit of almost 3 percent of GDP, say $450 billion, is consistent with a stable debt ratio.
Put these things together, and the real hole in the budget is a lot smaller than a trillion dollars -- in fact, there may not be a hole at all.
Now, this doesn't mean all is well. For one thing, if and when the economy recovers we really should be trying to reduce the debt ratio, not just keep it stable. Also, an aging population and rising health care costs mean that under current policy we will have a substantial structural deficit a decade from now, even if we don't have one currently. So I don't want to suggest that there is no deficit issue. But it's nothing like the ONE TRILLION DOLLARS that you keep hearing.

HEADLINE: Morgan Stanley Names New Regional Chiefs for Mergers Unit

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Morgan Stanley named new heads of mergers and acquisitions for the Americas and for Europe on Friday after a management reshuffling brought on by the impending departure of the senior deal maker Paul Taubman. 

 BODY:
Morgan Stanley named new heads of mergers and acquisitions for the Americas and for Europe on Friday after a management reshuffling brought on by the impending departure of a senior deal maker, Paul Taubman. 
The company named Bob Eatroff and Jim Head the co-chiefs of mergers and acquisitions for the Americas, according to an internal memorandum reviewed by DealBook. And the bank named Colm Donlon and Johannes Groeller the co-heads of mergers for Europe, the Middle East and Africa.
All four bankers, who will assume their new positions on Jan. 1, have worked at Morgan Stanley for more than 20 years.
Mr. Eatroff advised T-Mobile USA in its aborted attempt to sell itself to AT&T for $39 billion, as well as Comcast in its deal to buy control of NBC Universal. Mr. Head dispensed advice to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York on matters relating to the American International Group during the financial crisis of 2008.
Mr. Groeller advised Porsche on its sale to Volkswagen. Mr. Donlon advised Ryanair in its bid for Aerlingus.
Other top deals bankers will stay put: Robert Kindler remains the company's global head of mergers. Michael Boublik will still be chairman of mergers and acquisitions for the Americas. Scott Matlock will stay chairman of the international side of mergers and acquisitions.
The latest changes were precipitated by the announcement that Mr. Taubman, a co-chief of Morgan Stanley's securities business and one of Wall Street's top deal makers, would leave the company by the end of the year.
His impending departure led to some shuffling among Morgan Stanley's deal ranks, including the promotion of Mark Eichorn from Americas head of mergers to global co-chief of investment banking.
Separately, the company said that Susie Huang would become a vice chairwoman of investment banking. A veteran mergers specialist who worked on transactions like Wyeth's sale to Pfizer, Ms. Huang will focus on making deals and maintaining relationships with crucial clients.

HEADLINE: Doha: Weirdly Tame and Dispirited

BYLINE: ROBERT B. SEMPLE JR.


HIGHLIGHT: At the annual climate change negotiations there were no people in polar bear suits, and there was no solid agreement. 

 BODY:
The annual United Nations climate change negotiations this year in Doha, which wrapped up on Dec. 8, seemed weirdly tame and dispirited. There was minimal press coverage and, as Jennifer Haverkamp of the Environmental Defense Fund observed, there were "no people in polar bear suits, no passionate youth doing skits, no melting ice sculptures-no real infusion of energy." There was also no solid agreement on how to confront the threat of global warming by slowing the seemingly inexorable rise of heat-trapping emissions or by helping poor nations mitigate the inevitable damage or, preferably, both. That was not weird. These conferences have not produced a binding document since the Kyoto Protocol of 1997, which was itself flawed because it asked nothing of big developing nations, and, partly for that reason, was never ratified by the United States Congress. 
If one looked hard enough, however, one could find some encouraging notes. For one thing, the usually strident anti-Western (and especially anti-U.S.) finger-pointing was muted this time. Granted, Friends of the Earth International accused the "rich industrialized world, most notably the U.S." of "paralyzing the talks and forcing the world's poor to pay the price," and some of the left-leaning British press said much the same. But it all seemed rather perfunctory, and for good reason: many Western nations, including the U.S., are doing a decent (though by no means sufficient) job of reducing emissions. It's countries like China and India, and the oil-producing nations of the Middle East, that are doing a terrible job.

In the Copenhagen meeting three years ago, the European Union pledged to reduce emissions by 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020 . It is on track to meet and possibly exceed that goal. For his part, President Obama committed the United States to a reduction of 17 percent below 2005 levels, as called for in a bill that had passed the House but was later blocked in the Senate. For all sorts of reasons - including the recession, improved automobile efficiency, the increased use of natural gas instead of coal, and more efficient vehicles and appliances) the country is already more than halfway there.
Meanwhile, though, China's and India's emissions are soaring. China's emissions of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, have tripled since 1990. India's nearly so. Moreover, the two countries reportedly plan to build more than 800 new coal-fired power plants, three quarters of the of the world's total, locking in huge new emissions for decades. With trajectories like these, there is no way the world can prevent global temperatures from rising beyond the threshold (2 degrees Centigrade above pre-industrial levels) that mainstream scientists regard as the upper limit of safety.
A year ago, in Durban, climate negotiators agreed to draw up a new treaty by 2015 to replace Kyoto. The Doha negotiators ratified that schedule, and reaffirmed that this time around it would require detailed commitments from the developing as well as the developed countries. It should. As a blogger for Greenpeace wrote, after taking the obligatory shots at the U.S. delegation, "It is time for the emerging nations such as China, India South Africa and Brazil to step up and take a more progressive role in constructing a 2015 global climate deal, as well as reducing domestic emissions."

HEADLINE: Can You Be English if You Don't Speak English?

BYLINE: HARVEY MORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: The leader of Britain's opposition Labour Party wants to ensure new immigrants learn English. His remarks are seen as a repositioning of policy on the issue of immigration. But do language skills matter that much in a multicultural society? 

 BODY:
LONDON - Should immigrants be obliged to learn the language of their adopted country?
It is a perennial question in Europe, the United States and elsewhere and was raised again on Friday by Ed Miliband, the leader of Britain's opposition Labour Party.
Mr. Miliband, the son of Polish-born Jewish refugees from the Holocaust, said all newcomers to Britain should be expected to learn English and those in taxpayer-funded employment should be required to do so. 
Immigration is a political minefield in Britain as it is in other European countries where a growing number of unemployed citizens is chasing a diminishing number of jobs.
Census data published this week showed that 13 percent of the population of England and Wales was born outside Britain, while only 45 percent of Londoners now describe themselves as "white British." More than two million immigrants arrived in Britain in the past decade.
For many, Mr. Miliband included, the emergence of a multiethnic Britain is something to be celebrated. "I am the son of immigrants. I love Britain," he said in a closely watched speech. "But I am not going to shy away from the difficult issues."
His "One Nation" speech, which put the emphasis on the need for integration, was nevertheless seen as a nod in the direction of those who claim that Labour's policies when in power led to uncontrolled immigration and ethnic segregation in parts of Britain.
David Aaronovitch, a broadcaster and columnist for The Times of London, messaged the Labour leader on Twitter to tell him that his English language stipulation was "a bit of a stunt," and to suggest his speech was an attempt to neutralize the immigration issue for Labour.
@andybolton @ed_miliband I think he's trying to 'neutralise' the issue for Labour.
- David Aaronovitch (@DAaronovitch) December 14, 2012
Others suggested ahead of the speech that Labour was attempting to "reposition" itself on immigration to prevent losing some of its its traditional white, working-class supporters to other parties. 
Among practical measures, Mr. Miliband would reduce funding for translation services for immigrants in order to pay for their language classes. 
Mr. Miliband's speech came after Theresa May, the Conservative minister in charge of internal affairs, this week referred to the strains brought on by a decade of "uncontrolled mass immigration."
"You only have to look at London, where almost half of all primary school children speak English as a second language, to see the challenges we now face as a country to build an integrated, cohesive society," she told a center-right research institute. "How can people build relationships with their neighbors if they can't even speak the same language?" 
Jonathan Portes in The Guardian suggested the language issue was something of a myth. 
"It is true that almost half of all primary school children in London speak English as a second language," he wrote. "But this doesn't mean that they, or their parents, can't speak English with their friends and neighbors."
He added, "Census data shows that only one in eight households in London (and one in 25 in the country) don't include someone for whom English is a 'main' language; and even some of those will have people who can communicate perfectly well in English."
Anecdotal evidence is that young immigrants, or those born in Britain to immigrant parents, usually take responsibility for helping older relatives negotiate the challenges of living in an English-speaking society. 
The latest data suggest around one million new Londoners do not speak English. It might make practical sense for them to start learning it. But does it matter if they don't?
A visiting friend last week recalled the experience of his grandmother, a multilingual Holocaust survivor who eventually made her home in multicultural New York. 
Her six languages did not include English and she decided she did not need to learn it. Yiddish and Spanish turned out to be more than adequate to meet her daily needs.
 What do you think? Can newcomers truly be British or American if they don't speak English, or French if they don't speak French? Or are other attributes more essential to integrate in today's multiethnic societies? Let us know your views.

HEADLINE: With a Major Push, AARP Returns to a Hard Line Against Cuts in Benefits

BYLINE: By ERIC LICHTBLAU

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Seeking to stave off cuts in retirement programs, executives at AARP are determined to prove their mettle, not only to government officials negotiating a deficit deal but to their 37 million members as well.
The group, which advocates a range of federal health and fiscal issues that affect older Americans, angered many of its own last year when it opened the door for the first time to the possibility of accepting modest cuts in Social Security benefits.
Chastened, AARP now appears to have veered back to a hard-line position of opposing any cutbacks in Medicare or Social Security and is seeking to keep those programs off the bargaining table altogether. The group's stance has made it a favorite target in recent weeks for conservatives pushing for cuts in social programs. 
The strong position has won back some skeptics who questioned whether the nation's highest-profile advocate for older Americans was wobbling in its defense of crucial programs, said Witold Skwierczynski, a leader in a federal workers' union who has been organizing pickets at Social Security offices nationwide to protest possible cuts.
After last year's brouhaha, AARP officials ''got a lot of pushback and changed their tune,'' said Mr. Skwierczynski. ''I trust them now. They learned their lesson.''
It has no official seat at the bargaining table, but AARP, occupying a lavish blocklong headquarters not far from the Capitol, will play an outsize role nonetheless in the debate over the fiscal crisis as it seeks to protect benefit programs.
It has orchestrated a national television and radio advertising blitz, dispatched volunteers to Washington to meet with lawmakers and worked to organize grass-roots support at local levels. AARP's president, Barry Rand, was also among a group of civil liberties advocates who met with President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. at the White House in November to discuss the deficit negotiations.
The group's sheer size gives it clout in the discussions. It has an annual budget of about $1.4 billion and has spent more than $220 million on federal lobbying since 1998, to rank sixth among the top spenders, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks spending.
AARP sees the two biggest threats in the current negotiations as the possibility of Congress lowering cost-of-living increases for Social Security and raising the eligibility age for Medicare, ideas favored by Republican leaders.
If either step is included in any deal reached by the White House and Congressional Republicans, AARP executives are already primed to try to head them off by blocking passage in the House and Senate.
''At the end of the day, whatever agreement is reached by the leadership will be voted on by the entire Congress,'' Nancy A. LeaMond, AARP's chief lobbyist, said in an interview. ''What we want to do is paint a picture of what this would mean for the economic circumstances of people over 50.''
Leading Republicans in Congress, in resisting the White House's call for higher taxes on wealthy Americans, have demanded structural changes in entitlement programs that could mean deep reductions in payouts.
President Obama and leading Democrats, meanwhile, say there are ways to achieve significant savings without cutting benefits -- but they have not ruled out that approach completely.
If the Chamber of Commerce is the lead voice of business leaders on the right in opposing increased taxes in the deficit talks, AARP plays a similar role on the left in opposing benefit cuts. It hopes to meet or make contact with the office of every member of Congress before a deal is done.
''It's important for them to know where we stand, even if they disagree with us,'' Ms. LeaMond said.
Randy Myers, 76, who leads AARP's state organization in West Virginia, went to Washington last week and met with five of the state's Congressional representatives, including both its senators. He went armed not only with data about the programs' importance but also with a not-so-subtle message: what lawmakers ultimately do will matter deeply to the voters at home.
''They know when they come home and talk to seniors in West Virginia, they'll be asked: 'What's going to happen to my Social Security? What's going to happen to my Medicare?' '' said Mr. Myers, a former state Medicaid official. ''And if they don't have the right answer, they're going to hear about it.''
But AARP's success or failure comes with political risks for the group, which has been badly bruised in the past by its positions on issues like President Obama's sweeping health care reform and former President George W. Bush's plan in 2003 to provide prescription drugs through Medicare.
Conservatives have stepped up their attacks on AARP in recent weeks, accusing it of a financial conflict because it is lobbying to protect Medicare even as it receives millions in royalties from its backing of some Medicare-related insurance plans.
AARP officials say there is no conflict because their positions are determined independently of their financial interests.
Still, Congressional Republicans have raised the subject repeatedly; it was explored in a front-page article last week in The Washington Post.
The 60 Plus Association, an advocacy group affiliated with Pat Boone, which casts itself as a conservative alternative to its more prominent rival, charged last week on its Web site that AARP ''now is an annex of the Democrat party engaging in underhanded money-grubbing tactics that sell-out its members.''
Liberal groups have been at odds with AARP on particular policies as well. After last year's controversy over the group's position on Social Security, lesser-known advocacy groups on the left stepped in and were seen as stronger defenders of retirement programs.
AARP leaders now insist that any structural changes in Social Security must be considered down the road, separate from any last-minute deficit deal.
Protecting the entitlement benefits is the group's top priority at the moment.
''We're very focused on there not being cuts to beneficiaries,'' Ms. LeaMond said. ''This is a very big and very significant effort for AARP.''

HEADLINE: Fed Proposes New Cash Rules For Big Foreign Banks

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve is proposing that large foreign banks keep a bigger financial cushion against unexpected losses for their affiliates in the United States. The Fed governors, including the chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, voted 7 to 0 at a public meeting on Friday to propose the rules, which are intended to prevent another financial crisis. The rules were mandated by the 2010 financial overhaul. They would apply to those foreign banks that operate in the United States and have $50 billion in worldwide assets. That means their affiliates in the United States would be subjected to the same capital reserve requirements as United States banks. The United States operations would have to take the form of a bank holding company, putting them under the Fed's oversight. Mr. Bernanke said the proposal ''keeps a level playing field between foreign and domestic firms'' without inhibiting foreign banks from doing business in the United States. The rules, which would apply to 23 foreign banks, would not take effect until July 2015.

HEADLINE: Risk Creeps Up in Long-Term Bonds

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy on nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
THE Federal Reserve Board's Open Market Committee this week gave the first hint of what would cause it to allow interest rates to rise. It promised to maintain low rates until the unemployment rate -- at 7.7 percent last month -- fell to 6.5 percent, so long as inflation also remained quiet.
Fed officials do not think that will happen until late 2015, but they could be overly pessimistic. A year ago, they thought that the rate would not get as low as it is now until 2014. 
The prolonged low level of interest rates -- both short-term rates that are administered by the Fed and longer-term rates that are more subject to market forces -- has caused many investors to search for yield by purchasing longer-term bonds.
That has provided a bonanza for companies in the United States and in many emerging markets, where the amounts of newly issued bonds have risen rapidly.
''Almost any kind of corporate activity is acceptable to the bond market,'' said Michael Shaoul, the chief executive of Marketfield Asset Management. ''That is really a sign the bond market is becoming indiscriminate.''
For a bond investor, there are two things that can go wrong. The first is credit quality, when bonds either default or at least fall in market value because a default seems more likely. The second is interest rate risk -- the risk that market interest rates will rise significantly.
Mr. Shaoul said he thought investors in emerging market bonds were more likely to run into credit problems, while American bond buyers were more likely to face interest rate problems as the American economy improved.
''Five years down the road,'' he said, ''you are likely to have significantly higher interest rates.''
For a bond market investor now, the choice is to stick to shorter-term bonds, and get very low yields, or to move to longer-term ones that pay higher interest rates but that could lose market value if the interest rate offered on new bonds rose.
Much of the recent issuance in bonds has been because of refinancing, in which companies repay existing bonds with money borrowed on better terms. For holders, it can seem the worst of both worlds: if rates rise, they have old bonds that have lost value. If rates fall, their old bonds are redeemed by the company, depriving them of the yield they expected.
As can be seen in the accompanying graphic, corporate bond issuance in the United States has risen to record levels this year, and the average interest rate on high-yield bonds, also known as junk bonds because they are rated below investment grade, has fallen even more rapidly than have rates on higher-quality bonds.
Martin Fridson, the chief executive of FridsonVision and a veteran high-yield market analyst, said he thought high-yield investors were likely to lose money in 2013, as declines in prices offset the interest income realized from the bonds.
His model says the yield spread between the Bank of America Merrill Lynch High Yield Master II index and similar Treasury securities should now be around 6.5 percentage points, based on historical spreads as well as economic conditions, current default rates and the relative availability of bank credit. The actual difference, as shown by the chart, is about 5.3 percentage points, which he thinks is not enough to offset the risk.

HEADLINE: Consumer Prices Fall 0.3% on Lower Gas Costs

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- A steep drop in gasoline costs pushed down a measure of consumer prices last month, keeping inflation mild, the Labor Department said on Friday.
Gas prices fell 7.4 percent, the biggest drop in nearly four years, offsetting a 0.2 percent rise in food prices.
The seasonally adjusted Consumer Price Index dropped 0.3 percent in November from October, the department said. 
In another report on Friday, the Federal Reserve said that factory output increased 1.1 percent in November from October as factories rebounded from Hurricane Sandy. But after factoring out the storm's impact -- output declined 1 percent in the previous month, a drop that was blamed on the hurricane -- the broader trend in manufacturing remained weak.
Auto production jumped 4.5 percent last month, the first increase since July. Production of primary metals, wood products, electrical equipment and appliances all showed gains.
Total industrial output at factories, mines and utilities also rose 1.1 percent last month, after a 0.7 percent decline in October.
In the consumer price report, priced ticked up 0.1 percent in November, excluding the volatile food and gas categories. Core prices have risen 1.9 percent in the last year, below the Federal Reserve's annual target of 2 percent. Higher rents, airline fares and new cars pushed up core prices last month. The cost of clothing and used cars fell.
''In simplest terms, inflation is not a problem,'' Jim Baird, chief investment strategist at Plante Moran Financial Advisors, said. Lower inflation ''is a real positive that should provide modest relief for households dealing with limited income growth.''
High unemployment and slow wage growth have made businesses reluctant to raise prices, for fear of driving away customers. That has helped keep inflation tame.
Gas prices have fallen sharply in the last two months after spiking in the late summer. A gallon of gas cost an average of $3.29 nationwide Friday. That's 15 cents less than a month ago and 50 cents less than in mid-October.
The increase in food prices was smaller than many economists expected. This summer's drought in the Midwest, which scorched corn and soybean crops, has pushed up food prices, but not sharply. Food costs have risen 1.8 percent in the past 12 months.
The cost of milk, cheese and other dairy products, however, have risen 0.8 percent in each of the last two months. That could reflect the higher cost of animal feed, which usually includes corn and soybeans. Cereals and baked goods rose 0.3 percent last month.
But prices for the broad category of meat, chicken, fish and eggs fell in November after a big gain the previous month.
Shoppers may face further increases soon. Wholesale food costs jumped 1.3 percent last month, according to a separate report Thursday, the most in nearly two years.
Beef prices jumped the most in four and a half years, and vegetable costs rose sharply. Grocery stores may pass on some of those costs in the coming mons.
With inflation in check, the Fed said on Wednesday that it now planned to keep the short-term interest rate at nearly zero until the jobless rate fell to at least 6.5 percent, as long as inflation was not expected to top 2.5 percent.
It was the clearest sign yet that the Fed will keep rates low even after unemployment falls further and the economy picks up.

HEADLINE: Broad Catch Limits Are Put on Menhaden, an Unglamorous but Essential Fish

BYLINE: By JESS BIDGOOD

 BODY:
BALTIMORE -- Regulators on Friday voted to reduce the harvest of Atlantic menhaden by 20 percent, placing a broad catch limit on a critical fishery that has until now been largely unregulated.
A small, oily fish -- also called bunker or pogy -- the Atlantic menhaden is rarely eaten by humans, and little known outside of coastal circles. But for the Atlantic ecosystem as well as commercial and recreational fishermen, it is an essential fish. The question of its management drew hundreds of fishermen, processors and environmentalists to mobilize for a showdown in a windowless ballroom here.
''Menhaden's one of the linchpins of the near-shore ecosystem in the East Coast,'' said Peter Baker, the director of the Northeast fisheries program for the Pew Environment Group, who said that over the past 30 years, the stock of the fishery has fallen about 90 percent. 
The fishery had never been subject to catch limits along the entire Atlantic coast -- a rarity in contemporary fishery management -- allowing fleets to harvest virtually unlimited amounts from the ocean.
''The Wild West fishery that's been going on with menhaden -- to have a fishery that's essentially been unregulated, it's unheard of,'' said Darren Saletta, the executive director of the Massachusetts Commercial Striped Bass Association.
This unglamorous forage fish eats phytoplankton, cleansing ocean water. In turn, its flesh nourishes bigger, more edible and lucrative fish -- like striped bass and bluefish -- as well as seabirds and marine mammals.
It has long played a role in the American economy. Indians are said to have taught the Pilgrims how to use it to fertilize corn. Today, menhaden are important to commercial fishermen who use them for bait, as well as recreational fishermen who are after the species that feed on them.
''When there's bunker in the water, I have striped bass, weakfish and bluefish for my customers to catch,'' said Capt. Paul Eidman, a charter boat captain from New Jersey and the president of the advocacy group Menhaden Defenders. ''Without abundant menhaden in the water, my game fish go somewhere else.''
The hallways outside the meeting here filled with chatter as commercial and recreational fishermen swapped anecdotes about what many claim is an obvious depletion of the species.
''When we first started fishing for menhaden in Chatham, it was not a problem to go out with just a grappling hook and catch 20 in 20 minutes,'' said Capt. Dale Tripp, who has operated commercial and charter boats in Cape Cod since 1973. ''Now, you can't go out with a gill net and catch 20 in two hours.''
Many blame the ''reduction fishery,'' which harvests about 80 percent of the menhaden that come out of the sea each year. It is for the most part operated by a single company, Omega Protein, which grinds up the fish for use in fish-oil dietary supplements, fertilizer and animal feed.
But Omega's executives and fishermen say that they have not seen a problem with fish stocks and that overregulation could squelch industry jobs. ''We're catching more with less vessels, which, to us, means you can't have a declining population if less effort produces more fish,'' said Ben Landry, Omega's director of public affairs, who said that the company supported a 10 percent reduction in the catch, but nothing higher.
In 2011, stock assessments from the previous year led the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission to commit to make reductions in the fishery, although they did not determine exactly how to do it. Questions about the long-range accuracy of the 2012 stock assessment, however, led the board to decide to take interim actions this year, and conduct another review when 2014 stock assessments are available.
The opaqueness of the latest assessment fueled tension at Friday's meeting. As the regulators debated catch limits ranging from 10 to 50 percent, commercial and recreational fishermen held up yellow signs in support of menhaden conservation, a group of Omega's union workers -- also clad in yellow -- circled the room.
The cut could be damaging to Virginia, where Omega is based, said John M. R. Bull, a spokesman for the Virginia Marine Resources Commission. ''This is a very deep harvest cut that's being made in the absence of clear scientific understanding,'' said Mr. Bull, who added that he hoped future stock assessments would vindicate his home state.
And it will hobble the industry beyond those shores, said Robert Isaacson, a third-generation fisherman who, along with his brothers David and Richard, uses purse-seine nets to fish for menhaden off the coast of New Jersey.
''It's going to be less repairs on the boat, less buying new equipment. We're going to have to work harder on nasty days, put our lives in danger,'' Mr. Isaacson said.
But many other fishermen at the meeting were heartened by the cuts.
''It is absolutely crumbling, what's happening to the fish,'' said Chuck Howard, a longtime striped-bass fisherman from Rockville, Md. ''Anybody who thinks it's a better use to grind them up and send them to China, rather than have them swimming in the Chesapeake Bay and filtering our water, has to explain to me why that's a good idea.''

HEADLINE: China's Communist Party Chief Acts to Bolster Military

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Mia Li and Amy Qin contributed research.

 BODY:
GUANGZHOU, China -- Xi Jinping, the new Communist Party chief and civilian commander of the Chinese military, is moving quickly to make strengthening the country's armed forces a centerpiece of what he calls the ''Chinese dream'' of national rejuvenation.
The nationalist message of building up the People's Liberation Army has been broadcast loudly in the aftermath of Mr. Xi's recent visit to south China. The trip, which began Dec. 7, was Mr. Xi's first outside Beijing as party chief and is now being examined for his policy priorities. This week, the state news media gave prominent coverage to Mr. Xi's visit with troops of the Guangzhou military region, including a trip aboard the Haikou, a destroyer that belongs to the fleet patrolling disputed waters in the South China Sea.
''We must insist on using battle-ready standards in undertaking combat preparations, constantly enhancing officers' and troops' thinking about serving in battle, and leading troops into battle and training troops for battle,'' Mr. Xi said, according to a report on Wednesday by Xinhua, the state news agency, that was later published by prominent state-run newspapers. ''And we must insist on rigorous military training based on the needs of actual combat.'' 
Speaking to soldiers in the city of Huizhou, Mr. Xi emphasized the military aspects of his Chinese dream: ''This dream can be said to be the dream of a strong nation; and for the military, it is the dream of a strong military. We must achieve the great revival of the Chinese nation, and we must ensure there is unison between a prosperous country and a strong military.''
Mr. Xi's comments and the gearing up of the party's propaganda machinery behind them are certain to raise concerns among other Asian nations and the United States, the main military power in the Pacific. Analysts say the party has increasingly turned away from traditional Communist ideology and toward nationalism to try to legitimize itself in the eyes of Chinese citizens.
Mr. Xi ''understands the military and what China's military needs right now,'' said Shi Yinhong, a professor of international relations at Renmin University of China in Beijing. ''He wants real combat capabilities.''
Chinese naval forces are modernizing more quickly than the rest of the military, and certain aspects of that progression -- particularly a newly operational aircraft carrier that is China's first -- have become potent symbols of the nation's rise.
Mr. Xi made his comments during meetings with commanders of the Guangzhou military region, which encompasses large parts of south and central China, according to a front-page article on Friday in People's Liberation Army Daily. It was part of Mr. Xi's five-day trip in Guangdong Province and the special economic zone of Shenzhen.
Early this week, the state news media emphasized the economic side of Mr. Xi's southern tour, showing photographs and video of him visiting private companies and discussing economic policy with officials in the provincial capital, Guangzhou. A Xinhua report said that Mr. Xi underscored the need to deepen the market-oriented reforms begun in 1979 by Deng Xiaoping, the former supreme leader.
But by midweek, official coverage of the trip had shifted to Mr. Xi's visits with the military. Reflecting the more open style of leadership he has adopted, China Central Television ran extensive video of Mr. Xi shaking hands with cheering soldiers and eating a meal on Dec. 8 in a canteen with sailors in white uniforms aboard the Haikou. The People's Liberation Army Daily said that Mr. Xi sat in the captain's chair, signed the ship's log and ate in a self-serve canteen.
''Whether you've got the stuff to be a sailor,'' the newspaper said he told some sailors, ''doesn't depend on whether you throw up or not, but on whether you can eat after you've thrown up.''
The coverage coincided with what Japan called the latest Chinese provocation in the East China Sea. On Thursday, a Chinese military surveillance plane flew over islands there long under Japanese administration, escalating the already tense standoff over the islands, which are also claimed by China. Japan responded by sending fighter jets to the area, but the propeller-driven plane had already left. Earlier in the week, China sent a navy flotilla near the islands.
It is unclear how Mr. Xi's emphasis on building up the military will affect China's defense budget next year. In March, China announced that its military budget for 2012 had increased by 11.2 percent over last year, which was consistent with the pace of growth in military spending over the past decade. The official military budget was $106 billion, which is widely considered by foreign analysts to be an underestimate, but it is still a fraction of the military spending of the United States, which topped $700 billion this year.
The Xinhua report said that Mr. Xi also visited units in Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Huizhou. In his remarks in Huizhou, Mr. Xi emphasized the fact that the military is subordinate to the Communist Party. The relationship between the party and the military has been a recurring theme in official military publications. Editorials attacked the notion of ''nationalizing'' the army, which means separating the army from the party. There is talk that some generals may believe that to create a truly professional army, the military must distance itself from the party, but it is unclear how widespread this belief is.
Questions over officers' loyalties were raised in part by the scandal over Bo Xilai, the disgraced party official, and the ties that Mr. Bo had cultivated with generals.
Mr. Xi himself has close personal ties to some powerful generals because he, like Mr. Bo, is a so-called princeling, the son of a revolutionary leader. Mr. Xi's father was a revered Communist guerrilla commander during the Chinese civil war and later became party chief of Guangdong, where he helped to shape more open economic policies. Many princelings believe they are the inheritors of the revolutionary mandate to build a strong China, one that can stand up to the West.
Some generals have already latched onto Mr. Xi's take on national revival. Maj. Gen. Luo Yuan, an outspoken military commentator, wrote in an essay published Dec. 4 in Global Times, a populist newspaper, that ''the great revival of the Chinese nation includes the revival of the militaristic spirits worshiped by our ancestors, as well as the promotion of the revolutionary heroism of the Red Army.''
Changing of the Guard: Articles in this series are examining the implications for China and the rest of the world of the changes in the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party.

HEADLINE: The Other American Constitution

BYLINE: By NASSRINE AZIMI

 BODY:
Hiroshima
ON Christmas Eve 1945, Beate Sirota, a spirited and worldly 22-year-old naturalized American, born in Vienna of Ukrainian parents and raised in Japan, landed at Atsugi airport on the outskirts of the bombed-out rubble of Tokyo. She was returning ''home'' after almost six years, the first female civilian staff member of the Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, Gen. Douglas MacArthur.
Two months later Sirota became part of the drafting committee MacArthur set up to rewrite the Constitution of Japan. This had been implicit in the Potsdam Declaration and longed for by the majority of war-weary Japanese, many of whom believed the Meiji Constitution of 1890 to be one cause of their country's reckless and disastrous militarism. 
Initially the Americans had not intended to lead the drafting effort. Two attempts by the Japanese government, however, failed abjectly -- the conservative elite merely tinkering with the existing text, and one draft, unearthed by the Mainichi newspaper, becoming the laughing stock of the general public. Timing was of the essence: other war victors, especially the Soviets, were keen to constitutionally abolish the imperial system, a move MacArthur believed could unleash chaos.
So the general turned to his command's government section, staffed in those first months of the occupation by many young idealists and intellectuals from Roosevelt's New Deal era. Sirota was part of the subcommittee on civil rights and vividly recalls that feverish week in February 1946, when her familiarity with Tokyo, her research skills honed during the war years and her fluency in Japanese proved invaluable.
She commandeered a jeep and visited all the libraries still standing in Tokyo to collect constitutional texts -- including those of the Weimar Republic, France, the Scandinavian countries, the Soviet Union and of course the U.S. Constitution and Declaration of Independence. She often quotes the writer James Miki, who has said that the Japanese Constitution was written by ''the wisdom of history.''
That Constitution is now being challenged. On Sunday Japanese voters are again heading to the polls. They will decide how severely to punish the ruling Democratic Party of Japan, after little more than three years, for its anemic performance on the economy, worsened by the catastrophic earthquake, tsunami and nuclear accident in Fukushima in March 2011.
The Liberal Democratic Party, which ruled Japan for most of the postwar era, is impatient to return to power. A number of known and unknown politicians with national ambitions have emerged to form new parties, adding more uncertainty to the outcome.
Urgent challenges face the country. Its economy remains moribund. Business has suffered as a consequence of recent territorial disputes with China. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, a proposed Asia-Pacific free trade agreement, has turned deeply divisive. And the country still struggles with the consequences of the Fukushima nuclear disaster. Japan's future energy policy remains unknown.
In the midst of all this, calls for rewriting the Constitution, long a cause of the right, are getting louder. Both Shinzo Abe and Shintaro Ishihara, leaders of the two main opposition parties, have declared constitutional revision a priority. Many of my friends in Hiroshima fear that this will be used to discard Japan's peace clause, opening the possibility of militarization and even nuclear arms.
The ''American-written'' Constitution -- recently labeled by Ishihara as ''ugly'' -- is a convenient scapegoat for and distraction from the country's pressing challenges. But avoiding debate about it might be counterproductive. A Constitution, in the words of the scholar Takii Kazuhiro, is not just a legal document, but the very ''shape of the nation.''
Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution forever renounces war ''as a sovereign right of the nation and the threat or use of force as means of settling international disputes.'' This has not hindered the creation of the powerful Self-Defense Forces, so it is fair to ask what more Japan could have accomplished with a military carte blanche. Could thousands of Japanese youth have perished in the Korean War, or in Vietnam, or more recently in Iraq and Afghanistan?
That is not all. Shoichi Koseki, in his book ''Birth of Japan's Postwar Constitution,'' wrote that the Constitution contained some of the most advanced civil rights clauses of the time -- including Article 24, drafted by Sirota, which for the first time in Japanese history articulated equal rights for half of the country's population -- the women.
Scholars also note that from inception, the drafters were deeply influenced by the Japanese themselves. Twelve groups, including reformist political parties and a constitutional research association set up by some of Japan's leading intellectuals, submitted proposals.
The final draft was negotiated fiercely by the Japanese government in a marathon 32-hour translation session, and the text was debated for months by the legislature. The new Constitution clearly responded to the longings of the Japanese themselves. Otherwise it could hardly have survived unchanged for 65 years.
Sirota is now the last living member of the drafting team. After the MacArthur years she served as director of performing arts of the Japan Society and of Asia Society. Her love for Japan remains intact, and it is returned by Japanese women. Imbued with the idealism of a generation that actually experienced war, Sirota wrote in her memoirs, ''Only the article renouncing militarism really touched the hearts of people who had suffered such devastating losses.''
Despite the fact that the Constitution has enabled Japan to live for more than six decades in peace and prosperity, so long as there are politicians who disdain it as the work of foreigners there will be pressure to rewrite it.
When that happens, it is my hope that millions of Japanese, rightly proud of its uniqueness, will rise to its defense. A national debate could well stir deeper sentiments and reflections, especially among young people, reminding them never to take their peace and their democracy for granted, rallying them to fight for the future shape of their nation.
Nassrine Azimi, a senior adviser at the United Nations Institute for Training and Research in Hiroshima, is finishing a book on Beate Sirota Gordon and the Constitution of Japan.

HEADLINE: Message,If Murky, From U.S. To World

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
DUBAI
At the global treaty conference on telecommunications here, the United States got most of what it wanted. But then it refused to sign the document and left in a huff.
What was that all about? And what does it say about the future of the Internet -- which was virtually invented by the United States but now has many more users in the rest of the world?
It may mean little about how the Internet will operate in the coming years. But it might mean everything about the United States' refusal to acknowledge even symbolic global oversight of the network.
The American delegation, joined by a handful of Western allies, derided the treaty as a threat to Internet freedom. But most other nations signed it. And other participants in the two weeks of talks here were left wondering on Friday whether the Americans had been negotiating in good faith or had planned all along to engage in a public debate only to make a dramatic exit, as they did near midnight on Thursday as the signing deadline approached. 
The head of the American delegation, Terry Kramer, announced that it was ''with a heavy heart'' that he could not ''sign the agreement in its current form.'' United States delegates said the pact could encourage censorship and undermine the existing, hands-off approach to Internet oversight and replace it with government control.
Anyone reading the treaty, though, might be puzzled by these assertions. ''Internet'' does not appear anywhere in the 10-page text, which deals mostly with matters like the fees that telecommunications networks should charge one another for connecting calls across borders. After being excised from the pact at United States insistence, the I-word was consigned to a soft-pedaled resolution that is attached to the treaty.
The first paragraph of the treaty states: ''These regulations do not address the content-related aspects of telecommunications.'' That convoluted phrasing was understood by all parties to refer to the Internet, delegates said, but without referring to it by name so no one could call it an Internet treaty.
A preamble to the treaty commits the signers to adopt the regulations ''in a manner that respects and upholds their human rights obligations.''
Both of these provisions were added during the final days of haggling in Dubai, with the support of the United States. If anything, the new treaty appears to make it more intellectually challenging for governments like China and Iran to justify their current censorship of the Internet.
What's more, two other proposals that raised objections from the United States were removed. One of those stated that treaty signers should share control over the Internet address-assignment system -- a function now handled by an international group based in the United States. The other, also removed at the Americans' behest, called for Internet companies like Google and Facebook to pay telecommunications networks for delivering material to users.
Given that the United States achieved many of its stated goals in the negotiations, why did it reject the treaty in an 11th-hour intervention that had clearly been coordinated with allies like Britain and Canada?
In a Dubai conference call with reporters early on Friday, Mr. Kramer cited a few remaining objections, like references to countering spam and to ensuring ''the security and robustness of international telecommunications networks.'' This wording, he argued, could be used by nefarious governments to justify crackdowns on free speech.
But even Mr. Kramer acknowledged that his real concerns were less tangible, saying it was the ''normative'' tone of the debate that had mattered most. The United States and its allies, in other words, saw a chance to use the treaty conference to make a strong statement about the importance of Internet freedom. But by refusing to sign the treaty and boycotting the closing ceremony, they made clear that even to talk about the appearance of global rules for cyberspace was a nonstarter.
It may have been grandstanding, but some United States allies in Europe were happy to go along, saying the strong American stand would underline the importance of keeping the Internet open.
''This could be a watershed moment in the discussion of Internet freedom,'' said Jochem de Groot, senior policy officer for the Internet and human rights in the Foreign Ministry of the Netherlands, which joined the United States in opposition to the pact.
That the talks -- convened by a United Nations agency, the International Telecommunication Union -- took place in this economically liberal but socially and politically battened-down emirate underscored the symbolism of the United States boycott of the final treaty.
''There were a lot of messages being sent to countries around the world,'' said Moez Chakchouk, chief executive of the Tunisian Internet Agency, in an interview. ''It's a good message to start the debate.''
Since the Arab Spring deposed the authoritarian government of President Zine el-Abidine Ben-Ali of Tunisia, that country has taken a strong stand in support of Internet freedom. Nonetheless, Mr. Chakchouk said his government would sign the telecommunications treaty because he was satisfied with the free-speech guarantees that had been written into it.
''It's important for all of us to work together,'' he said. ''It's not good when one country doesn't understand the issues.''
Working together could become more challenging as the Internet -- especially bandwidth-hungry video applications -- accounts for an ever greater share of global telecommunications traffic, and as more people in developing countries go online.
According to Hamadoun Touré, secretary-general of the telecommunication union, the goal of the treaty was not to take control of the Internet -- as critics had contended -- but to narrow the digital divide.
While the United States was talking about the open Internet, Mr. Touré and developing countries were talking about opening the Internet to more of the 4.5 billion people around the world who remain offline.
Mr. Touré emphasized treaty proposals for stimulating investment in broadband networks, for reducing cellphone roaming costs and for extending Internet access to disabled people in developing countries. The goal was to expand broadband at an affordable cost, not to regulate the content that travels on the Internet, he said.
''What is the meaning of building cars if there are no highways for them to drive on?'' Mr. Touré said at a news conference on Friday, where the telecommunication union tried to put a positive spin on the messy pileup of the previous evening.
As developing countries gain better access, the numbers game will continue to tilt against the United States and other developed countries that have championed the cause of an open Internet. The Internet population of China -- 538 million as of June, according to the Chinese government -- is already nearly double that of the United States.
Mr. Kramer said that as Internet use expands in developing countries, governments and citizens of these countries might also grow more tolerant of it.
''It is clear that the world community is a crossroads in its view of the Internet and its relationship to society in the coming century,'' Mr. Kramer said.
By Friday evening, 89 of 144 countries that were eligible to vote had signed the document and about two dozen had indicated that they would not, Mr. Touré said, with the rest still undecided or undeclared. Holdouts could change their minds and sign later. Mr. Touré said he was hopeful that the United States would eventually do so, though Mr. Kramer said this was unlikely.
Otherwise, the events in Dubai raise the curious prospect of a treaty largely negotiated to suit the United States' position and applying mostly to developing countries, many of which seemed perfectly happy with the outcome.

1912 Christmas Crowds Start for U.S.
LONDON -- The Cunard steamship Lusitania, which left Liverpool yesterday [Dec. 14] for New York, with every berth occupied, was almost the last of the big steamers carrying Americans across the Atlantic in time to pass Christmas in the United States. There remain only the Amerika, which leaves Southampton and Cherbourg to-day, and the Majestic, on Wednesday, which will have to make a rush for the other side to be in time. There was quite a Christmas air about the platform at Euston station yesterday before the three boat trains left for Liverpool, and there was an immense crowd seeing friends off. 
1937 Keller's Secretary Now a Citizen
NEW YORK -- Mary Agnes Thomson, secretary of Miss Helen Keller, has been admitted to citizenship in the United States before Justice James T. Hallinan in Supreme Court, Queens, after Miss Keller had appeared as her sponsor. Miss Keller, taking the stand, was asked by the court clerk: ''Do you, Miss Keller, know Miss Thomson, and can you vouch for her character?'' Miss Keller was accompanied by an interpreter, Edward A. Richards, former Municipal Court justice, an old friend, who transmitted the question by moving his fingers over her mouth. She answered in a similar manner and Mr. Richards said ''yes.'' In admitting her to citizenship Justice Hallinan said Miss Thomson ''is very fortunate in having a woman of such integrity and high standing in the community as Miss Keller to vouch for her.''
1962 Urging for More NATO Forces
PARIS -- Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara today [Dec. 14] put before the North Atlantic Treaty Organization a massive case -- military, political and economic -- to show how and why NATO could and should improve its conventional military forces. Mr. McNamara and Secretary of State Dean Rusk, who also spoke today on the political aspects of defense policy, both reiterated briefly the standing United States offer to discuss with any interested NATO partners the formation of a NATO multinational nuclear force. But there were no takers at today's meeting and the matter got little more than a mention. The Defense Secretary said it was of major interest to the United States to try to meet the legitimate security interests of the NATO partners in the field of nuclear cooperation.

HEADLINE: A Bouquet of Global Sports Moments

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER CLAREY

 BODY:
USHUAIA, ARGENTINA -- On a December journey down here near the bottom of the world, as boats leave this port for Antarctica, the highs and lows of the sports year seem like they happened on another planet.
At least for a little while, anyway.
At the end of a gravel road at Estancia Harberton, a remote reminder in Tierra del Fuego of 19th-century missionary fortitude, an Argentine tour guide named Rosario still feels the sting of the women's field hockey gold medal that Argentina lost in August in faraway London.
''Those nasty Dutch,'' she said this week. ''But our Pumas gave it their best.''
It is tough work indeed to find a place where this Olympic year did not leave a trace, from hermetic Saudi Arabia, where outside pressure finally forced the country to include women on its Olympic team, to the tiny Caribbean island of Grenada, which celebrated its first Olympic medal -- a gold -- when Kirani James won the 400 meters. 
Sports are ever more a global obsession, even if the Olympics placed only third in Google's rankings of the year's trending events, behind Hurricane Sandy and the release of those photos of the Duchess of Cambridge (yes, those photos of the former Kate Middleton).
Sports continued to divide across latitudes and other lines in 2012. One team's or one tribe's triumph was another's downer, and sometimes elation turned to deflation -- and vice versa -- in a flash.
On May 13, Manchester United had yet another Premiership title in its grasp in the dying moments of its last soccer match of the season, against Sunderland. Meanwhile, ManU's local rival, Manchester City, which needed a victory to secure the title, was more than 90 minutes into its final match and losing, 2-1, to Queen's Park Rangers.
But stoppage time was just enough time for Edin Dzeko and Sergio Agüero to score the goals that would give the other club from Manchester its first league title since 1968. Mancunians and plenty of neutrals will never forget it.
Fast forward now to the last day of September and the tree-lined golf course at Medinah Country Club, with its neo-Byzantine clubhouse looming like a mirage in the Chicago suburbs.
But there would soon be other reasons for rubbing one's eyes at Medinah as Europe's Ryder Cup team, down 6-10 to the United States on the final day, commenced rolling in putt after putt to set in motion the most impressive comeback in the Cup's 85-year history.
Grown golfers were soon in tears and invoking the memory of Seve Ballesteros as the Europeans, with precedent and a rowdy crowd overwhelmingly against them, pulled off the 14-13 victory with plenty of help from wobbly Americans like Jim Furyk and Steve Stricker.
''Why does it feel like we just robbed a bank?'' cracked Ian Poulter, the European ringleader, as he prepared to get out of town and head home to Florida.
Poulter, despite his domicile, remains British and the European victory was the last major coup for the British in a year in which they had to make the collective psychological adjustment from gallant losers perennially disposed to celebrate the underdog to serial champions delighted to roar with a pirate crew's zeal over the latest acquisition of gold.
They appeared to adapt quickly. The Olympics -- deftly staged by London -- were the primary engine as the Brits built on a surprisingly strong 2008 performance in Beijing and ended up with 65 medals, 29 of them gold, which put them third in the gold-medal table, behind the United States and China and ahead of the likes of Russia, Germany and, most importantly, Australia, which suddenly forgot how to win swimming races.
''We lit the flame and lit up the world,'' said Sebastian Coe, the lighter in chief as head of the London Organizing Committee.
By year's end, even everyday Britons were catching the fever with increases in sports participation, particularly among women, and big increases in recreational cyclists.
But London 2012 and the Paralympics that successfully followed were hardly the only driving force behind Britain's annus mirabilis.
''The most extraordinary thing of all is that, even without the Olympic Games, this would have been the most impossibly fabulous sporting year,'' wrote Simon Barnes in The Times of London.
The first big hint came in Melbourne in January when Andy Murray -- a great and grumpy talent trapped in a golden era of men's tennis -- pushed and pushed against Novak Djokovic in the semifinals of the Australian Open. With his stoic new coach, Ivan Lendl, observing every long rally, Murray lost a five-set marathon in which defense repeatedly proved superior to offense and in which Murray, even in defeat, showed a new big-match resilience.
As the season continued, Murray busted through the barriers, becoming the first British man to reach the Wimbledon final in 74 years before losing to Roger Federer, then winning the Olympic gold medal on the same stretch of lawn against the same opponent, and finally, at the U.S. Open in September, playing another five-set marathon against Djokovic and prevailing to win his first Grand Slam singles title.
There was more for Britain, much more. There was a first victory in the Champions League for Chelsea (which at least had a British address); a first British victory in the Tour de France, courtesy of Bradley Wiggins; a commanding eight-shot victory from Rory McIlroy in the U.S. P.G.A. Championship, and victory after victory for the undefeated English wonder horse Frankel.
As the loot piled up, it was almost possible to forget that England had failed to get past the quarterfinals at the European soccer championships, won by Spain, the defending champion, with cruel beauty over Italy by the sandlot score of 4-0.
Yes, athletes from outside the British Isles actually triumphed, too, in 2012.
Usain Bolt was shaky early, losing twice at the Jamaican Trials to Yohan Blake. But it was a false alarm as he ran riot at the Olympics again, winning three more gold medals -- in the 100, the 200 and the 4-by-100 relay -- and declaring, with typical understatement: ''I am now a living legend. Bask in my glory.''
The German Sebastian Vettel became the youngest triple world champion ever in Formula One, winning his third straight title at 25. Also 25, Lionel Messi scored more goals in a single season for soccer club (Barcelona) and country (Argentina) than any man in history.
It was a good year for Americans, too. LeBron James, new leadership skills converging with his sublime talents, led the Miami Heat and the U.S. men's Olympic basketball team to victory.
Serena Williams produced some of the most convincing tennis of her mood-swinging career to win Wimbledon, the Olympic singles title and the U.S. Open at age 30. Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson won their first majors in golf. Ashton Eaton broke the world record in the decathlon. And Gabby Douglas won the Olympic all-around title in women's gymnastics.
Michael Phelps retired on a high note, if not his highest note, with four more gold medals and two more silver medals, bringing his record Olympic totals to 18 golds and 22 over all. Missy Franklin, who swam to four golds and a bronze in her first Olympics at age 17, has work to do.
And then in the midst of all this serial American achievement, there was Lance Armstrong, described by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency as a ''serial cheat'' as it stripped him of his seven Tour de France titles and laid out -- in exhaustive, deeply demoralizing detail -- the doping program allegedly orchestrated for years by Armstrong.
In a year when sports seemed to master the hardware with the first-rate staging of London 2012, Armstrong's fall after a decade of suspicion made it clear that there are still major software issues, along with another gaping hole in the old-fashioned record books.

HEADLINE: Shares Continue to Slide, Awaiting a Budget Accord

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks fell on Friday as another decline in Apple took a toll and investors unloaded some shares because of the uncertainty surrounding the budget negotiations in Washington.
All three major stock indexes ended the week slightly lower, the Nasdaq for the second consecutive week. 
Apple's stock slid 3.76 percent, to $509.79, after the iPhone 5 received a tepid reception in China.
UBS maintained its buy rating on Apple, but cut its price target to $700 from $780 and expressed concerns that iPhone production may be dropping.
Shares of Apple have fallen 27.4 percent since their closing high of $702.10 on Sept. 19.
The S.& P. Information Technology Index lost 1 percent as Apple fell and Jabil Circuit fell 5.5 percent, to $17.51, after UBS cut its price target.
Stocks have been treading water as the possibility of not reaching a deal to settle the budget impasse until early next year is rising.
''We're faced with uncertainty,'' said Larry Peruzzi, senior equity trader at Cabrera Capital Markets in Boston. ''And that's going to continue now into January. It basically puts everybody on hold and just have the markets kind of thrash around.''
President Obama and the House speaker, John A. Boehner, held a ''frank'' meeting on Thursday at the White House to discuss how to avoid the tax increases and spending cuts set to kick in early in 2013.
The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 35.71 points, or 0.27 percent, to 13,135.01. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 5.87 points, or 0.41 percent, to 1,413.58. The Nasdaq composite index lost 20.83 points, or 0.70 percent, to 2,971.33.
For the week, the Dow slipped 0.15 percent, while the S.& P. 500 fell 0.3 percent and the Nasdaq declined 0.2 percent.
Among other Nasdaq decliners, shares of the chip maker Qualcomm slid 4.7 percent, to $59.83.
Best Buy slid 14.7 percent, to $12.05, after the electronics retailer agreed to extend the deadline for the company's founder to make a bid.
Among the day's economic data, consumer prices fell in November for the first time in six months, indicating inflation pressures were muted.
A separate report showed manufacturing grew at its swiftest rate in eight months in December.
Chinese data was encouraging, as Chinese manufacturing grew at its fastest rate in 14 months in December. The news was deemed as helpful for materials companies in the United States, including United States Steel, which rose 6.8 percent, to $23.85.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 8/32, to 99 9/32, and the yield fell to 1.70 percent from 1.73 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: New Moves Push N.H.L. Toward Edge

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
Their labor negotiations stalled, the N.H.L. and the players union traded legal jabs on Friday, moves that raised the chances that the entire season could be canceled.
With no face-to-face meetings between the sides on Friday and the lockout three months old, the executive board of the N.H.L. Players' Association voted to let its membership vote on whether to empower the board to disclaim interest. That move would be similar to decertifying the union because both moves could lead to challenges against the league on antitrust grounds. 
The vote by the more than 700 players is expected to take place in the next few days. Even if they give the board the power to disclaim interest, there is no guarantee the board will use it.
Still, the N.H.L. took pre-emptive legal countermeasures when it filed a class-action complaint in federal court in New York seeking to confirm the legality of the lockout, which the players would challenge if they disclaimed interest. At the same time, the N.H.L. filed a charge with the National Labor Relations Board alleging that the union's vote ''constitutes bad-faith bargaining.''
In a statement, the union said: ''The N.H.L. appears to be arguing that players should be stopped from even considering their right to decide whether or not to be represented by a union. We believe that their position is completely without merit.''
The legal maneuvering echoed similar steps taken by the N.F.L. and its union last year. The league ultimately came out on top in those cases, but the two sides settled before any games were lost. The stakes are much higher for the N.H.L. and the union because the league has canceled 42.8 percent of the schedule, including the All-Star Game and the Winter Classic. The legal wrangling could move the fight between the two sides into the courts, consuming what is left of the season.
''This shows in so many words that the negotiating has bogged down and the season is really in jeopardy,'' said Mark Conrad, who teaches sports law at the Fordham University School of Business. ''The N.H.L. is saying the fact that you are trying to disclaim interest is pre-emptive and we're going to play chicken with you. It's not good.''
A vote by the players to allow the board to disclaim interest would not preclude the league and the union from continuing to bargain. Despite the presence of federal mediators, the two sides have been unable to find solutions on significant issues, including salary caps, the length of player contracts and the length of the collective bargaining agreement.
The troubled talks led Fitch Ratings, a financial ratings agency, to issue a report on Friday that said the labor strife added to the financial instability of the league and its brand.

HEADLINE: E.P.A. Sets a Lower Limit For Soot Particles in the Air

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Environmental Protection Agency announced a new standard for soot pollution on Friday that will force industry, utilities and local governments to find ways to reduce emissions of particles that are linked to thousands of cases of disease and death each year.
The agency, acting under a court deadline, set an annual standard of 12 micrograms per cubic meter of air, a significant tightening from the previous standard of 15 micrograms, set in 1997, which a federal court found too weak to adequately protect public health. The new standard is in the middle of the range of 11 to 13 micrograms per cubic meter that the E.P.A.'s science advisory panel recommended. 
Communities must meet the new standard by 2020 or face possible penalties, including loss of federal transportation financing.
The E.P.A. based its action on health studies that found that exposure to fine particles -- in this case measuring 2.5 micrometers in diameter -- brought a marked increase in heart and lung disease, acute asthma attacks and early death. Older people, adults with heart and lung ailments and children are particularly susceptible to the ill effects.
The agency estimates the benefit of the new rule at $4 billion to $9 billion a year, and the annual costs of putting it into effect at $53 million to $350 million.
''These fine particles penetrate deep into the lungs, causing serious and costly health effects,'' said Lisa P. Jackson, the E.P.A. administrator. ''As the mother of two sons who have battled asthma, the benefits are not just numbers or abstract concepts.''
Today 66 counties in eight states do not meet the new standard, including the metropolitan areas of Los Angeles, Houston, St. Louis, Chicago, Cleveland and Pittsburgh. The E.P.A. estimates that by 2020, when the rule is fully in force, only seven counties, all of them in California, will still be out of compliance. Other current rules on mercury, sulfur and other pollution from vehicles, factories and power plants will cause that reduction.
''We know clearly that particle pollution is harmful at levels well below those previously deemed to be safe,'' Dr. Norman H. Edelman, chief medical officer for the American Lung Association, said in a statement. ''It will save lives,'' he said.
Utility industry officials pleaded with the E.P.A. on Thursday to delay the release of the new rule, arguing that the standard is based on incomplete science and would impose costly new burdens on states and cities.
Utilities, joined by trade associations representing manufacturers, chemical companies and the oil and gas industry, said the new rule would push many communities into noncompliance, making it harder to obtain permits for new businesses that create jobs.
Scott H. Segal, representing a coalition of coal companies and utilities, wrote to Ms. Jackson, pointing to a 2011 study saying that citing counties for noncompliance ''increases energy prices, reduces manufacturing productivity and causes local manufacturing companies to exit the areas that are designated as being in nonattainment.''
Six senators, led by Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, wrote Ms. Jackson on Friday expressing concern about the new rule. ''E.P.A. should not rush at this time toward imposing more regulatory burdens on struggling areas,'' the lawmakers wrote.
Advocates of the new rule said these complaints were overblown. ''While the health benefits are extensive, opponents of common-sense pollution standards are repeating false time-worn claims that clean air is too costly,'' said Vickie Patton, general counsel of the Environmental Defense Fund.
Jeffrey R. Holmstead, who led the E.P.A.'s air quality office in President George W. Bush's administration and who now represents business clients, took a more sanguine view of the agency's action than many other industry spokesmen.
He said the impact of the new rule would depend on how the E.P.A. chooses to enforce it. ''Normally, a new standard means a rash of new regulations, but E.P.A. claims that virtually every area of the country will meet the new standard without the need for new regulatory requirements,'' he said in an e-mail. ''If so, then maybe the new standard won't cause the type of economic disruption that we've seen in the past.''

HEADLINE: A Proliferation of Ways to Use a Tax Break as Its End Nears

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
HOLIDAY shoppers and tax filers are known for procrastinating. This year, they're joined by the wealthy who have still not decided whether to make a gift under a generous gift tax exemption that may soon disappear.
Back in December 2010 President Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner reached an agreement to raise the exemption levels on estate and gift taxes to $5 million a person as part of a deal to extend the Bush-era tax cuts. (This year, that rate was adjusted upward for inflation to $5.12 million.)
As I have often written, this was an amazing giveaway to the superrich. But it also provoked anxiety among those at the next level down -- the merely very rich -- for whom giving away as much as $10 million a couple, to avoid higher taxes when they die, was not as simple a matter. The gifts represented a larger percentage of their net worth.
Now, with a little more than two weeks left in the year, tax lawyers and advisers say the wealthy are scrambling to make gifts before the exemption expires. 
''We are having this come up daily,'' said Mitchell A. Drossman, national director of wealth planning strategies for U.S. Trust. ''One of the first things I'm asking is, 'Why are they warming up to this idea now? Is it that they didn't want to make the gift? They didn't know how? They didn't get around to it?' ''
With so little time left, advisers have come up with quick and easy ways to get the gift done for tax purposes this year.
A simple solution is to forgive any loans made to family members. This is a fairly painless way to use up some of the gift tax exemption because most parents never expected their children to repay those loans and would have forgiven those loans at death anyway.
While giving cash outright is easy, few wealthy people want to do that. The exemption may be at a historically high level, but the wealthy still want to give assets that will continue to grow.
Leiha Macauley, a partner and head of the Boston office at Day Pitney, says one solution is to set up a trust that allows someone to put in cash now and exchange it for other assets in the future, when the person has had enough time to have the assets properly appraised. Using the so-called power of substitution means that cash can become just about anything else next year.
''The power of substitution is key when we're so pinched for time,'' she said. ''Appraisals are not coming out quickly enough. And people giving right up to the limit makes us nervous, because what if the appraisal says something is worth $6.2 million and then the I.R.S. says you owe tax?''
Typical assets that people swap in later include a home, which they then rent back from the trust, or a large life insurance policy, which can be purchased with the cash. But Andy Katzenstein, a partner in the personal planning department at the law firm Proskauer Rose, said he had clients ready to swap more nontraditional assets into trusts. One has a collection of Ferrari sports cars, while another couple has art that is valuable but that they no longer like displaying in their house.
These assets also have the virtue of being relatively painless to part with. The man with the Ferraris can pay the trust rent when he drives one of the cars. (The rent further reduces the estate's value.) The couple with the art already had it in storage.
But Mr. Katzenstein cautioned those choosing this option to know the law, particularly if they plan to keep using these assets. ''The devil is in the details,'' he said. ''If you don't follow the rules you get into trouble. Make sure you have a real lease, you pay the rent every month and it also has to be fair market rent.''
Mark E. Haranzo, a partner at the law firm Withers Bergman, said he had suggested to clients with private companies that they use the cash as essentially a down payment on a loan to put all or part of their company into a trust for their children. He said the general rule of thumb was to put down 10 percent of the value of the company and then use the company's profits to pay off the loan.
For the really rushed, Mr. Katzenstein said, another option is to include the power to rewrite the terms of the trust next year if their lawyer does not have time to customize a trust for them before the end of the year. This is done by naming someone to the role of ''trust protector'' and allowing that person to rewrite the trust at a later date.
''This is a way to get you from the simple thing you set up this year into the thing you want next year,'' Mr. Katzenstein said. ''The only thing you have to be careful of is to make sure the protector doesn't rewrite the trust in his favor. Most people are naming their lawyers.''
The one place that stymies these golden giveaways is Connecticut, where there is still a state tax on gifts over $2 million. Mr. Haranzo said Connecticut clients who wanted to give the full $5.12 million in cash would have to pay $240,000 in state gift taxes.
Like many things having to do with tax, there are ways around the state tax. One is to give out-of-state property, like a house on Nantucket or in Florida. Another is to give away art that is kept in another state.
But he said some people were taking the view that the state tax was worth paying, given the size of the savings on federal taxes. ''They are saying, 'This is too good of an opportunity for the $5 million exemption -- I'll pay the price in Connecticut.' ''
For people afraid of giving up control of so much money, there are at least three ways to give the money as a gift and still have access to it.
Ms. Macauley said a few clients were opting to set up trusts that can be unwound up until midnight on Dec. 31. If an agreement is reached that extends the gift tax exemption at the current level -- or even does away with the estate and gift tax all together -- then the person will be able to hold onto that money. In another situation, if the person who created the trust dies before the end of the year and the assets would be taxed at a lower rate in the estate, then the trust would also be unwound.
If neither situation comes to pass, then on the last day of the year, the trust becomes irrevocable and the gift is made. Ms. Macauley warned, however, that some lawyers questioned whether the I.R.S. would allow this maneuver.
Another option is to take a loan from the trust to live on. Ms. Macauley laid out a chain of events in which a woman lived in a house worth $3.25 million and had millions more in stock that would incur a hefty tax bill if sold. (At death, the capital gains on the stock get wiped out.) She could give all of her cash to the trust and then borrow it back.
She would have to pay interest on the loan, which would get more money out of her estate. But the loan would not be paid back until she died and other assets were sold.
''If the family sells the house for $3.5 million but she owed $500,000, that lowers the amount of the estate,'' Ms. Macauley said.
She added: ''There is no limit on borrowing, but you have to pass the sniff test. It has to be reasonably secured with an adequate amount of interest.''
A third way is to pledge to make the gift in the future through a self-created promissory note. Mr. Drossman said for tax purposes the gift would be recognized when the note was created. The person making the gift also has to pay the trust interest on what is essentially a loan to make a future gift.
''It provides a unique and interesting solution,'' he said. It works best for people who have their wealth tied up in illiquid assets like real estate or a hedge fund they run.
Of all the strategies, this future gift sounded almost fictional, but Mr. Drossman assured me that it was not. ''It's real,'' he said. ''The person who gives this away truly wants this to be real. It's just they don't have the liquidity today but it will be there in two to three years' time.''
Here's the rub, though: If Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner again come to a last-minute agreement as they did two years ago and the exemption levels on estate and gift taxes are unchanged, all this maneuvering could be for naught.

HEADLINE: Senate G.O.P. Splitting With House Over Taxes

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A split developing between House Republican leaders and some Senate counterparts who are increasingly open to extending the expiring Bush-era tax cuts only for the middle class is adding to pressure on Speaker John A. Boehner to cut a deficit reduction deal with President Obama.
Senate Republican aides said Friday that Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, sounded out his Senate Republican colleagues Thursday on a plan to extend the expiring tax cuts for incomes under $250,000, while attaching some Republican priorities like low tax rates on capital gains, dividends and inherited estates. 
Leadership aides emphasized that Mr. McConnell was not advocating any specific plan, nor was he saying that extending the middle-class tax cuts was the only option to resolve a potential fiscal crisis next month when hundreds of billions of dollars in tax increases and automatic spending cuts are scheduled to kick in.
''Senator McConnell does not advocate raising taxes on anybody or anything,'' Don Stewart, a McConnell spokesman, said Friday. ''Despite the president's failure to lead or to offer any real solutions to the last four years of trillion-dollar deficits, Republicans will continue to look for ways to protect American families and jobs while strengthening entitlement programs.''
But Senate Republican voices favoring a swift extension of the middle-class tax cuts are proliferating. Senator Richard M. Burr, Republican of North Carolina and a close friend of Mr. Boehner's, told reporters Thursday: ''We're for extending the middle-class tax rates. We can debate the upper-end tax rates when we do tax reform. But if we've got to do this to get the president focused on reform of taxes, preservation of entitlements -- Medicare, Social Security and Medicaid -- I'm all for it.''
Senator John Cornyn of Texas, who will take over next year as the Senate's No. 2 ranking Republican, told Politico this week, ''I believe we're going to pass the $250,000 and below sooner or later, and we really don't have much leverage there because those rates go up by operation of law Dec. 31.''
A Cornyn spokeswoman, Megan Mitchell, said the senator's sentiments were ''addressing a worst-case scenario'' that did not produce a broad deal that prompted serious negotiations next year to overhaul the tax code and entitlement programs like Medicare.
But with time running out, the worst case is nearly here. Besides Mr. Cornyn and Mr. Burr, several other Republican senators -- Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Olympia J. Snowe of Maine, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Bob Corker of Tennessee -- have called for passing an extension of the middle-class rates now.
Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky, a Tea Party favorite, said Republicans in the House should call up the Senate-passed bill extending the middle-class tax cuts, then vote ''present'' in protest, allowing Democrats to ''own'' the tax code.
''State what you're for, then vote present,'' he said in an interview. ''Let them raise taxes, and at that point, it's theirs. They're the party of higher taxes. We have to remain the party of low taxes.''
But in the House, only a handful of Republicans have joined the chorus. Most are still holding out hope that a deal can be reached to extend all the expiring tax cuts for a year while Congress tries to overhaul the tax code in a way that raises additional revenue but sets the top tax rate no higher than the current 35 percent.
Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, a senior Republican on the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, said ''decoupling'' the Bush-era rates and allowing the top rates to rise to Clinton-era levels could kill momentum for changing the tax code because Democrats would already have what they want: higher taxes on the rich and more revenue for the government.
''Raising tax rates in January makes it very difficult to do tax reform in September,'' he said.
Michael Steel, a Boehner spokesman, shrugged off the idea that such views might be creating pressure on negotiations now.
''We're focused on getting a balanced plan from the White House that will begin to solve the problem of our debt and deficit to improve the economy and create American jobs,'' he said. ''Right now, all the president is offering is massive tax hikes.''

HEADLINE: On Capitol Hill, Fiscal Talks Now Turn to U.S. Borrowing Limit

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The government is within days of hitting its legal borrowing limit, complicating the already fraught negotiations between the White House and Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, the de facto leader of the Congressional Republicans.
According to the Treasury Department, the government is about $66 billion below its $16.4 trillion debt ceiling, a legal borrowing limit that is set and periodically raised by Congress. When the country hits the ceiling -- sometime toward the end of December, analysts estimate -- it would start a countdown clock that would end with Washington running out of money to pay its bills.
That event might hobble the government, ruin the country's credit and send markets into an outright panic, analysts predict. But despite -- or because of -- the debt ceiling's potential to disrupt the economy, members of Congress are refusing to raise it as a matter of course, instead using it as a potent political football to extract concessions from the other side. 
''I will not raise the debt ceiling ever again until we get significant entitlement reforms, because if we don't reform entitlements, we're going to become Greece,'' Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said on CNN this week. If President Obama ''doesn't lead, there's going to be one hell of a fight over raising the debt ceiling.''
The White House has pushed back by warning Republicans away from the ceiling in strong terms. ''We cannot play this game, because while it might be satisfying to those with highly partisan and ideological agendas, it's not satisfying to the American people and is punishing to the American economy,'' said Jay Carney, the White House spokesman, this week. ''We cannot do it.''
Some Democrats have in recent weeks urged the White House to mount a legal challenge to the ceiling itself. The White House has ruled out such measures. But in its initial proposal to avert the worst of the year-end tax increases and spending cuts, the so-called fiscal cliff, the Obama administration asked Congress to grant it more authority over the ceiling.
The White House's plan -- based on a proposal initially made by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader -- would allow it to request an increase to the debt limit. Congress could pass a resolution blocking the increase, though such a resolution could be killed with a presidential veto.
Republicans immediately rejected the proposal. But it stems from the Obama administration's deep frustration with Capitol Hill's use of the ceiling as a source of political leverage, both last year and this year.
Mr. Boehner and Mr. Obama tried and failed to strike a long-term debt package before raising the debt ceiling, but not before scaring the markets and leading to the first-ever downgrade of the country's credit rating.
This time, the ceiling is complicating the renewed negotiations on a long-term debt deal. Republicans are considering a plan to preserve the tax cuts on income up to $250,000 that Mr. Obama has requested, and then in the new year refuse to raise the debt ceiling unless the Obama administration concedes to cost reductions for Social Security, Medicaid and Medicare and possibly other programs.
When the country hits the ceiling, the Treasury would stop issuing new debt and start a series of ''extraordinary measures,'' technical maneuvers to leave it with enough money to pay all its obligations. But such extraordinary measures would buy the government only about six to 10 weeks, analysts estimate.
Eventually, its spending obligations would overwhelm incoming receipts, and the government would not be able to pay its bills. That would leave the Treasury in the position of choosing whether to pay bondholders or soldiers, the elderly or states.
Last summer, ''Treasury considered asset sales; imposing across-the-board payment reductions; various ways of attempting to prioritize payments; and various ways of delaying payments,'' a department report said. ''Treasury reached the same conclusion that other administrations had reached about these options -- none of them could reasonably protect the full faith and credit of the U.S., the American economy, or individual citizens from very serious harm.''
Knowing exactly when the Treasury would reach that point is an exercise in guesswork. The Bipartisan Policy Center estimates the date would fall sometime in February.
If Congress failed to address any of the year-end spending cuts or tax increases, the government's revenue would rise and spending obligations would fall. But analysts say they do not think that would delay the need to raise the debt ceiling for more than a few days.
''I've been here in 40 years this coming January, and I have never seen this many consequential spending and tax problems descend at the same time,'' said Steve Bell, senior director of economic policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center, and a former Republican Hill staff member.
''There might be a variation of a day or two or four,'' he guessed. But by sometime in March, Congress would have needed to raise the ceiling or the country might have entered another financial crisis -- or even another recession.

HEADLINE: Tax Plan Is Popular, But Not Quite Fair

BYLINE: By JAMES B. STEWART

 BODY:
Mitt Romney may have lost in November, but the ghost of the Republican presidential candidate lives on in the debate over tax reform and the fiscal cliff.
Mr. Romney's proposal to limit itemized deductions to a fixed dollar amount, which surfaced during the campaign as a way to close loopholes for the wealthy and broaden the tax base, has attracted a surprising amount of bipartisan support, given its origins in conservative Republican circles.
''There's renewed interest'' in the cap on deductions, Senator Kent Conrad, the North Dakota Democrat who heads the Senate Budget Committee, told The Times last month as budget negotiations heated up.
The political appeal of a proposal that limits deductions without actually naming any -- inciting the powerful interests and lobbyists that support them -- seems obvious. But many tax experts said that a fixed dollar cap is anything but the evenhanded approach to closing loopholes it appears to be. 
Moreover, without addressing larger tax preferences, like a lower rate on capital gains, it does almost nothing to cure the so-called Buffett problem, in which Warren Buffett's secretary pays a higher effective rate than her billionaire boss. It doesn't even raise much revenue.
Some tax experts have gone so far as to say it's a conservative Trojan horse, a stealth tactic that protects the very wealthy while targeting Democrats who itemize deductions and live disproportionately in high-tax states like New York and California. It would also affect donors who support elite colleges, universities, museums -- even experimental theater -- which are perceived as havens for liberals.
And it would hit people like me: taxpayers in higher brackets who rely on earned income as opposed to investment income or an inheritance, who give to charity and live in a high-tax state. Assuming a $35,000 limit on itemized deductions, my federal tax last year would have risen to 27 percent of my adjusted gross income, from 22 percent.
I wouldn't mind paying more as long as people who make vastly more did, too. But limiting the itemized deductions of the top 400 taxpayers with an average adjusted gross income of $202 million in 2009 (the most recent year available) would have raised their taxable income by an average of $32 million and their average rate to 25 percent from 20 percent, assuming a marginal rate of 35 percent, and even less if they pay a lower marginal rate, as most do.
That's a lower rate than I paid, because nearly half their income, on average, was from capital gains.
Martin Feldstein, a Harvard economist and the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Reagan, is widely credited with the idea for an across-the-board cap on itemized deductions as a way to help lower the deficit. His proposal last year called for capping deductions at 2 percent of adjusted gross income.
Mr. Romney embraced the concept, but proposed a fixed dollar cap as low as $17,000 rather than a percentage. Since then, the idea has been embraced by politicians from both parties and the centrist research organization Third Way.
(The proposed cap on deductions shouldn't be confused with President Obama's proposed 28 percent cap on the rate at which deductions can be claimed by high-income taxpayers.)
Despite its bipartisan support and seemingly neutral approach, it didn't take long for the nonprofit sector to figure out that a fixed dollar cap on itemized deductions is a stake aimed at the heart of the charitable deduction. That's because of the three largest itemized deductions -- state and local taxes, mortgage interest and charitable contributions -- only charitable contributions are entirely discretionary.
People have to pay state and local taxes, and in high-tax states like New York, Massachusetts and California, that deduction alone would reach the cap and in many cases exceed it, depending on where it's set. Many people require a mortgage to own their homes, and are contractually obligated to repay it.
''No one wants to say, 'Let's kill the charitable deduction,' but across-the-board limits would hit charitable deduction the hardest,'' Eugene Steuerle, co-director of the Tax Policy Center at the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, told me this week. ''And it's a big mistake to think that only the wealthy would be affected. Many lower- and middle-income people go to churches, museums, hospitals and colleges. They're the ones who are going to be hurt.''
Patrick Rooney, executive director of the Center on Philanthropy at Indiana University, agreed.
''We haven't empirically studied the effect of a Romney-style cap on deductions on charitable giving,'' he said, ''but this will certainly have a deleterious impact. Tax benefits aren't the main reason people give, but charitable giving is sensitive to changes in marginal rates. And some charities will be more affected than others. Religious organizations tend to be less affected, because the donation may be a spiritual obligation. But colleges and universities, the arts, and in some cases hospitals, are right to be very concerned.''
Leonard Burman, a tax expert at Syracuse University and co-author of the recent book, ''Taxes in America: What Everyone Needs to Know,'' said that ''most itemized deductions are of dubious merit -- they don't do much good, and they're not well-targeted at providing assistance to people who really need it.''
But, he added, ''Just about everyone agrees we should encourage charity.''
Even proponents of a limit on deductions have suggested some modifications. Since the election, Professor Feldstein has renewed his proposal for a cap at 2 percent of adjusted gross income, but now excludes from the cap charitable donations, untaxed health care benefits and untaxed municipal bond interest.
''Unlike most other deductions and exclusions, charitable gifts do not benefit the taxpayer,'' he wrote this month in Foreign Affairs. ''The increased giving generated by tax deductibility is important for maintaining private support for universities, churches, hospitals and cultural institutions.'' (As a result, Professor Feldstein's proposal wouldn't have raised my 2011 taxes at all.)
Many conservatives and advocates of smaller government have embraced a cap on deductions because it would curtail the deduction for state and local taxes in high-tax states, and reduce their federal subsidy.
According to the Census Bureau, state taxes per capita in 2011 ranged from $3,491 in New York to $1,674 in South Dakota. For many higher-income taxpayers in high-tax states, state and local taxes alone would exceed the cap limit, completely depriving them of the mortgage and charitable deductions.
Whatever the public policy merits of the state and local tax deduction (and many tax experts are critical of it), it's a politically charged issue, since high-tax states tend to be heavily Democratic. Of the top 10 highest-tax states, all but Texas and North Carolina supported President Obama.
Harvey Rosen, a Princeton economist who created a stir during the campaign when he offered academic support for Mr. Romney's tax proposals, predicted that a cap would put pressure on high-tax states to lower their rates and spending.
''There's empirical evidence consistent with this,'' said Professor Rosen, who headed the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush. ''Jurisdictions with high tax rates tend to have bigger public sectors. To the extent the deduction is scaled back, it forces citizens to confront the true costs of their public sectors. And I happen to think that there's no particular reason for people in low-tax states to be supporting people in high-tax states.''
Still, even though he said he supported the idea of a cap on deductions, he said it would be pointless if all it did was raise revenue without also lowering marginal rates. ''If you have a revenue neutral tax reform, lower rates and get rid of deductions, I'd sign up,'' he said.
Limiting itemized deductions for higher-income taxpayers while leaving marginal rates unchanged would raise revenue, but critics of the measure note that it's a relatively paltry amount considering the total amount of tax expenditures -- the term tax experts and economists prefer when analyzing the tax code.
Tax expenditures are the revenue the federal government forgoes by exempting some income from taxation, and includes not just deductions but also preferential rates on capital gains and income and untaxed employee health care benefits. Mr. Steuerle estimates that total tax expenditures for 2015 will amount to $1.2 trillion, while itemized deductions will total $180 billion, or just 15 percent of total expenditures.
''It's a mystery to me why the discussion has only focused on itemized deductions rather than capping total expenditures, like the preferential rate for capital gains and dividends,'' William Gale, co-director of the Tax Policy Center, said. ''Take capital gains. That should be a prime candidate for curtailing tax expenditures. You could apply a 15 percent rate to the first $50,000 and then raise it to 25 percent or even the level of ordinary income.''
And since so many wealthy people derive so much of their income from capital gains, such a measure would directly address the Buffett problem.
''Of course that would drive some very high income people nuts,'' Mr. Gale said.
Republicans have strenuously opposed any increase in capital gains rates, and the notion that low rates on capital gains promotes economic growth is an article of faith for many conservatives, even though the empirical evidence is inconclusive.
President Obama has proposed raising the capital gains rate to 20 percent, which would still be a preferential rate for high-income taxpayers.
Mr. Steuerle said: ''People don't want to talk about tax preferences and exclusions. They don't want to tackle capital gains and untaxed health care benefits. Itemized deductions are easier because they're the first thing people see. They're on the tax return. But legislators are really just dodging the real issues, which would be controversial and take a lot of work.''
Even though it would take more time, he said Congress should examine each category of tax expenditure and pass a comprehensive tax reform bill that makes sense in terms of policy and fairness.
''Almost all tax experts -- left, right and independent -- feel that the best way to reform government programs, whether hidden in the tax code or not, is to tackle each one on its own merits,'' Mr. Steuerle said.
The proposed cap on deductions, he added, ''is nothing but a simplistic solution to the very messy and convoluted tax system that they've created.''

 NEWS A 20-year-old man wearing combat gear and armed with pistols and a rifle killed 26 people - 20 of them children - in an attack in an elementary school in Newtown, Connecticut, before committing suicide on Friday. It was America's second-deadliest school shooting, exceeded only by the 2007 Virginia Tech massacre. James Barron reports. 
European Union leaders pledged on Friday to take further steps to set up common banking rules for the bloc, but they delayed plans for a shared budget for the euro zone nations as pressure appeared to be easing on the single currency. James Kanter reports from Brussels.
The lesson of Japan's last major election, which ousted the long-dominant Liberal Democrats, was that a growing hunger for change had seemed to reach a threshold. But voters look ready to return that party to power Sunday, determined to punish the governing Democratic Party for failing to rein in bureaucracies and mishandling the 2011 nuclear crisis. Martin Fackler reports from Kanazawa, Japan.
At the global treaty conference on telecommunications in Dubai, the United States got most of what it wanted. But then it refused to sign the document and left in a huff. What was that all about, and what does it say about the future of the Internet? Eric Pfanner reports from Dubai.
The U.S. defense secretary, Leon E. Panetta, signed a deployment order on Friday to send 400 American military personnel and two Patriot air defense batteries to Turkey as its tensions intensify with neighboring Syria. Germany and the Netherlands will also send Patriot batteries. Thom Shanker and Michael R. Gordon report.
Xi Jinping, the new Communist Party chief and civilian commander of the Chinese military, is moving quickly to make strengthening the country's armed forces a centerpiece of what he calls the "Chinese dream" of national rejuvenation. Edward Wong reports from Guangzhou.
Nearly a decade after the German government embarrassingly failed in an attempt to ban the country's leading extreme-right political party, the upper house of Parliament on Friday voted to launch a new effort to have the National Democratic Party deemed unconstitutional. Melissa Eddy reports from Berlin.
 SPORTS It's tough to find a place where this Olympic year didn't leave a trace, from hermetic Saudi Arabia to tiny Grenada. But for Britain, 2012 was a true annus mirabilis, and the London Games were not the only force behind it. Christopher Clarey looks back.

HEADLINE: Without Babies, Can Japan Survive?

BYLINE: By ALEXANDRA HARNEY. 
An international affairs fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, who is based in Japan.

 BODY:
TOKYO
THE first grade class at the elementary school in Nanmoku, about 85 miles from Tokyo, has just a single student this year. The local school system that five decades ago taught 1,250 elementary school children is now educating just 37. Many of the town's elegant wooden homes are abandoned. Where generations of cedar loggers, sweet potato farmers and factory workers once made their lives, monkeys now reside. The only sounds at night are the cries of deer and the wail of an occasional ambulance.
Nanmoku's plight is Japan's fate. Faced with an aging society, a depopulating countryside and economic stagnation, the country has struggled for decades to address its challenges. As Japan goes to the polls on Dec. 16 for parliamentary elections that will most likely mean the seventh prime minister in six years, voters need to demand that politicians address the most important issue of all: the country's low birthrate. 
Sadly, this issue is hardly being discussed on the campaign trail. Instead, parties are promising to lavish more money on special interests like construction companies, the main beneficiaries of public works spending.
Nowhere is the rapid aging of Japan more visible than in rural towns like Nanmoku, where 56 percent of local residents are over 65. Over the next 25 years, the proportion of Japan's population that is elderly will rise from almost one in four to one in three. Sales of adult diapers will soon surpass those of baby diapers.
The reason for Japan's plight stretches back decades. The countryside lost people to the cities during Japan's era of rapid growth between the early 1950s and the late 1980s. The population in rural areas continued to decline even after the country's growth began to slow in the early 1990s. To secure the rural vote, the Liberal Democratic Party, which held power almost continuously from 1955 until 2009, devoted huge amounts of the state's budget to infrastructure projects that were intended to revitalize the hinterland. But the revitalization never occurred. Towns were left with deserted train stations, empty hot-spring resorts and extraordinary levels of debt.
Just as America has its military-industrial complex, Japan -- whose constitution forbids a formal army -- has its ''construction state.'' Public largess went to pouring concrete across the country. It's clear now that Japan should have been less focused on building bridges to nowhere and more focused on making babies.
Although Japanese couples consistently say in surveys that they would like to have more than two children, they don't. Part of the problem is Japan's prolonged economic malaise. Years of stagnant (or declining) incomes have made Japanese men less attractive as potential partners. And economic uncertainty has led couples to delay getting married and having children. The shortage of public day care centers, especially in cities, has made the cost and burden of parenthood so high that today's couples either have fewer babies or none at all. (Japan's birthrate is just 1.39 children per woman.)
The government provides subsidized day care, but there is a long waiting list in big cities. Working parents often end up paying more to send their kids to private centers. While there is no exact international comparison, a 2009 survey by the Japanese government found that the first five years of child rearing, including savings, cost around $73,000, more than 2.5 times as much as in the United States.
Japan could address its baby shortage by taking three basic steps that have been discussed for years but have never enjoyed sufficient political leadership to be enacted. First, the government must create more subsidized public day care centers, which would make child care more affordable for more people.
Second, companies must dismantle old systems that promote employees on seniority, rather than skills. These antiquated practices hold down young workers' salaries and keep the labor market too rigid. And companies should discourage overtime work so that employees have more time with their families.
Third, both the government and companies should encourage more women to enter the labor force with high-quality jobs on a par with men and offer incentives to women to return to work after childbirth. In places where these sorts of reforms have taken hold, from France to Sweden, the result has been a boost to the birthrate and the economy.
To be sure, an increase in the birthrate is no quick fix. Even if Japan were to increase its birthrate next year, it would take at least a generation before the country began to tackle its demographic imbalances. The only shortcut would be a significant increase in immigration, a deeply controversial subject in Japan. Conservative politicians and right-wing groups are opposed to bringing in more workers from overseas, and some Japanese worry that foreigners would not assimilate well.
The lesson of Nanmoku is that spending one's way out of a crisis doesn't work without reforms that address the root causes of the malaise. Until Japan's leaders take steps to boost the birthrate, the whole country -- like the countryside -- will continue to shrink.

HEADLINE: Once More, With Shrinkage

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE ULRICH

 BODY:
WHILE I was driving the new BMW X1, the Russian nesting dolls called matryoshka came to mind.
Like several purveyors of sport utilities and crossovers, BMW has offered models that initially seemed to be sized just right, at least until Americans decided, like antsy homeowners, that they needed more room. BMW duly expanded its smallest S.U.V., the X3, after customers complained that it wasn't spacious enough for family duty.
There was only one problem: the redesigned X3 was suddenly as spacious inside as the X5, which had been the bigger -- and more expensive -- of the pair. So BMW gave the X5 a significant stretch, too.
All this one-size-upmanship, with a continuing microscopic experiment -- how many American guinea pigs will squeeze into tinier, fuel-efficient cars? -- has opened up a wholly unexpected niche within the crossover niche. 
Hence, the concept of Russian nesting dolls: the X1 is the baby, slotting neatly inside the X3 and X5 -- a smaller space than you might have imagined possible for a quasi-S.U.V. BMW's new baby is no mistake, so long as Americans are eager to pay $32,000 to $52,000 for a crossover with no more interior space than a compact station wagon.
I wouldn't bet against it. The X1 is based on the solid 1 Series, and it may easily outstrip the popularity of that small but pricey coupe. The X1 is much more practical, and it offers the raised ride height and all-wheel drive that Americans have voted for time and again.
The X1 travels fast, handles dynamically and is surprisingly luxurious for a junior crossover. If that's not enough, it delivers fairly spectacular mileage, at least when drivers act as if they're in a Prius, not an M3.
A weeklong spin in the 240-horsepower X1 xDrive 28i delivered what seems to be a harbinger of success for utility vehicles: the women that I encountered fell hard for it. One actually said, ''When you told me you were bringing a BMW, I didn't picture anything like this.''
Their refrain matched what I hear when I'm forced to take my friend's Shih Tzu for a walk: ''Oh, it's so cute!'' As with that little dog, I heard it enough times that I began to believe it myself.
Honestly, the BMW is awfully cute, with a streamlined profile and an intriguing tussle of convex and concave surfaces. Deep-set headlamps glide into a crisp crease along the doors, finishing in striking tubes of crimson light in the taillamps. Arrow-shape cutouts in the tailgate lend a sense of forward motion. Gray sections of the front and rear fascias contrast with optional 18-inch wheels in a glossy geometric pattern.
So how small is this thing?
Stretching 176.5 inches, the X1 is two inches shorter than a Ford Focus sedan. The BMW is 6.5 inches shy of its X3 big brother and about three inches narrower. The X1's roofline is also lower -- by a significant 4.6 inches -- than the X3's. That avoids the school-bus silhouette of many compact sport utilities, and the seating position is barely higher than a sedan's. Ultimately, the X1 is more of a jacked-up luxury hatchback than any sort of truck.
The reclining back seat will just fit two adults with minimal complaint, though there is a dubious center perch for three-abreast situations. But riders will also see a level of luxury and features -- many at extra cost, given that this is a BMW -- not far removed from an X3 or X5.
The lovely midnight blue paint of my 28i test car contrasted with rust-color leather seats and doors, dark copper trim, a natty gray-and-aqua pinstripe across the seats and an embossed ''X'' on the front headrests. A parabola of matte-finish wood ($500 extra) makes an arc along the dash and is repeated on all four doors.
While the xDrive 28i starts at $33,245, the fancier interior is part of the available xLine and Sport Line trim packages ($1,900 for either) or the M Sport Line ($2,500 or $3,000).
The M Sport upgrade also adds niceties including sport seats, a firmer suspension, paddle shifters and summer tires. Another $600 brings handsome 19-inch alloy wheels. There are 25 cubic feet of storage behind the second seat row, matching the enlarged 2013 edition of the 3 Series wagon that will go on sale next spring. Dropping the rear seats, which are split in a 40/20/40 configuration, opens up 56 cubic feet of cargo space -- a surprise, given the vehicle's small footprint. Still, taller-roofed S.U.V.'s can handle yet more stuff, including more unwieldy items; consider the roughly 71-cubic-foot cargo hold of the utilitarian Honda CR-V.
The BMW, to its credit, feels anything but utilitarian. The company's new 2-liter turbocharged TwinPower engine is rapidly transforming BMW's American lineup. If there's a better combination of 4-cylinder power and economy in the world today, I haven't driven it.
With 241 horsepower and a mighty 258 pound-feet of torque, the TwinPower scoots the xDrive 28i from a standstill to 60 m.p.h. in a company-estimated 6.3 seconds. Yet that muscle takes no toll at the pump, with the all-wheel-drive model achieving an impressive E.P.A. rating of 22/33 m.p.g. The CR-V manages just 30 highway m.p.g., even with 56 fewer horsepower and a deficit in torque of 95 pound-feet.
For special-effects rocketry, the $39,345 xDrive 35i gets a stronger and more sonorous in-line 6 that counts advantages by threes: 3 liters of displacement, 300 horsepower and 300 pound-feet of torque. Acceleration to 60 m.p.h. drops to 5.3 seconds, though fuel economy also drops, to 18/27 m.p.g.
In a first for a BMW sport ute, the X1 offers a rear-wheel-drive version, the sDrive 28i. Starting at $31,545, this most affordable X1 makes financial sense for people whose lives and driveways are unencumbered by snow. Mileage for this version is even better, at 24 m.p.g. in town and 34 on the highway.
Buyers of the more expensive 35i may pointedly inquire as to why they get only six forward speeds; a slicker 8-speed ZF automatic transmission is reserved for 4-cylinder models. Fans of manual gearboxes are out of luck, with no stick shift offered in any X1.
Flight aficionados may recall the bullet-shaped X-1, piloted by Chuck Yeager in 1947, as the first aircraft to break the sound barrier. BMW's X1 may be less quick, but it's fast enough to sweep aside petite crossover competitors, including the Mini Countryman and the new Buick Encore.
With its powder keg of an engine, the 35i seems an anomaly in its class. Even a 420-horsepower Porsche Cayenne GTS won't beat this BMW in a drag race, and saddled with roughly 1,000 additional pounds, the Cayenne would be likely to lose a battle on the racetrack as well.
Interestingly, all-wheel-drive X1s have a secret weapon you won't find even on a megapowered $100,000 M5 or M6: hydraulic steering rather than the electrified units sweeping through BMW and the industry at large. I returned enthusiastic from an early drive wondering why the X1 felt more connected than some BMW automobiles I'd been testing. One answer is the X1's old-school steering, which has no electric motors to filter out road feel.
If the X1 is the baby doll of the BMW S.U.V. family, its engine stop-start system is Raggedy Andy: the system means well, switching off the engine at stoplights to save fuel. But as with other BMWs, its automatic restart is so shuddery that I reflexively pushed the dashboard button that turns off the system entirely.
Less obtrusive is the ECO PRO setting, especially when you're in a cruising, cool-jazz state of mind. This button-operated mode mutes the throttle response and seeks higher transmission speeds to save fuel. The X1's bounteous torque lets the system operate with little apparent strain, in contrast to similar but more annoying systems from Nissan, Toyota and others. ECO PRO can also flash efficient driving tips on the center display screen when, for example, you defy the program by hammering the throttle or brakes.
Even without ECO PRO, the 28i delivered a laudable 35 m.p.g. during a steady 65 m.p.h. cruise, beating its federal rating by two m.p.g.
Luxury, performance and technical excellence will cost you. My heavily optioned 28i test car came in at $45,595.
Russia's nesting dolls are known for traditional peasant attire. The four-wheel Bavarian versions may be more fun to play with, but they're dressed and priced at haute-couture levels.

HEADLINE: This Is Your Life (Recalled By an App)

BYLINE: By JENNA WORTHAM

 BODY:
THE holiday season of 2011 was a hive of activity for me. One week in early December, I managed to attend a party at the Bowery Ballroom, a movie premiere and a Justin Bieber-themed dinner event. A few days later, in a single afternoon, I saw the movie ''Young Adult,'' bought animal-shaped glassware as Christmas gifts and shared dishes of handmade pasta with a few friends from college. And three nights after that, I attended a concert at a local music venue with a friend from Australia, then woke up the next morning and hopped on an Amtrak train to Virginia for Christmas.
I know all of this not because my memory is superhuman, or because I keep a detailed journal. My gift of meticulous recollection comes courtesy of several apps I've signed up for, including Timehop and Rewind.me. They tap into my social media history and send daily reminders of my past postings, from pictures uploaded to Instagram, the photo-sharing application, to messages on Facebook and Twitter. 
At a basic level, these services serve as a cognitive crutch, excavating details about the past that I might not otherwise remember. They offer historical insight into a digital world that is in many ways ephemeral -- full of constantly refreshing newsfeeds.
While social networks tell their users what is happening right now, these newer services document life of a year or more ago. They rely on a proliferation of personal data scattered around the Web and easily retrieved with the help of clever engineering and software algorithms. And they offer a rare backward glance, an anthropological perspective on our own online behavior. For example, I've noticed that last year, I was posting many photographs and disclosing personal details of my life on social networks, but that these days, I've shifted into a cooler, less intimate mode.
Danielle Morrill, founder and chief executive of Referly, a product-recommendation start-up in San Francisco, found that using Timehop, which pings her iPhone with information about how she spent her day exactly one, two, three or even five years ago, reminded her just how ''powerful time can be.''
''Sometimes I'll realize I was doing the exact same thing I was doing a year ago, and I'll have to ask myself if I'm cool with that,'' Ms. Morrill said. ''I was grinding through work last year, and I'm still doing that now. Maybe I should think about taking a break. It makes you reflect.''
Timehop and its peers are byproducts of a time of information overload. Many of us can barely keep up with the nearly nonstop stream of news, updates and details about the world around us, let alone find time to put the past into the context of the present.
''Every social network is based in real time,'' said Jonathan Wegener, one of the founders of Timehop, which was released to the public in October. ''They tend to push down old information, but they don't leave space to remember it.''
Mr. Wegener has joined a small cluster of entrepreneurs looking to capitalize on a kind of Internet-era archaeology, excavating the troves of data we've left on the Web and repackaging them for our enjoyment. It's an economy betting that as much as people want to pipe details of their daily lives into the social Web as they happen, they will also want reminders on the anniversaries of those experiences -- whether theirs or, in some cases, someone else's. People who sign up for Timehop, for example, can see the social-media pasts of friends who are also using the service. And if Timehop users choose to do so, they can send their memories to other social networks where friends can comment about them.
EXHUMING the past, of course, is fun only until you stumble onto something unpleasant.
In my case, a recent perusal offered photographs of a pet cat that had died, as well as pictures of an exuberant evening with a friend I no longer spend time with. Such reminders can be almost unbearably painful, or they can provide the extra nudge to send a ''hello, again'' e-mail.
Mr. Wegener said users often requested features that would let them block a particular person or period from appearing in their digest.
Technologically, building such filters would not be impossible, Mr. Wegener said, but he hasn't done so yet. He said the notion reminded him of the film ''Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,'' a quirky romantic comedy in which the main characters wipe away any traces of their past relationship, and presumably, the trauma inflicted.
Such filters are ''something we're considering carefully,'' he said.
It's not clear whether these applications have long-term business potential. Timehop, for example, says it is focused on attracting people to its app, rather than worrying about how it will make money. The company has raised a little more than $1 million from a list of investors that includes Spark Capital and the founders of Foursquare.
Some researchers who study how people interact online say that these services are a logical evolution for social media and hold the potential for longer-term value.
For one thing, they can remind us exactly how long the ''half-life of our digital footprints can be'' said S. Shyam Sundar, a director of the Media Effects Research Lab at Pennsylvania State University. ''People who never stopped to think that their digital postings would be archived could become more aware of their actions online.''
They could usher in a much-needed dose of reality about the permanence of the digital Web, a truth that is hard to grasp when so much of what we post online feels so ephemeral, visible for only a few seconds.
Behaving as if our digital data is fleeting can cause serious trouble, said Mr. Sundar, especially as our offline and online worlds merge. Our actions, documented through the content we share, can have very real effects on what colleges we get into, what jobs we qualify for and what people we meet.
''We have to start taking seriously the idea of social media as self-representation,'' he said. ''Social media is no longer just a mirror of the present, but also the past.''

HEADLINE: A 'Witch' and a Builder

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
She has been called the world's greatest miser, a dubious distinction apparently richly deserved. In ''The Richest Woman in America'' (Nan A. Talese, $27.95), Janet Wallach, who wrote an acclaimed biography of Gertrude Bell, the British imperialist, resurrects the imperious Hetty Green, the so-called Witch of Wall Street, whose saga is so incongruous it cannot be retold too often.
Skip the few contemporary economic references and stick to Green's investing acumen (mostly real estate and railroads), her hoarding of cash (she bailed New York City out more than once by buying short-term bonds) and her legendary frugality (she conducted much of her business from a bank to save on office rent and took her young son to a free health clinic for the poor when he broke his leg). 
''What man has done, women can do,'' was one of Green's adages. Her father wasn't so sure, believing that Green, as a woman, was incapable of managing her own finances, but also insisting that her fiancé relinquish rights to her inheritance.
She was immortalized in an O. Henry short story (''I'm not Hetty if I do look green,'' the poor working girl said, settling on a $2 room instead of one that rented for $8). But Green -- a billionaire by today's standards -- has been largely forgotten.
''What remains,'' Ms. Wallach writes, ''is her legacy: a woman who stood her ground, who defied the crowd and refused to follow its whims.''
Holidays demand coffee-table books, and there's no shortage of them this year.
''Ralph Walker: Architect of the Century'' (Rizzoli, $50) by Kathryn E. Holliday, who teaches at the University of Texas-Arlington, borrows the title bestowed on Walker in 1957 by The New York Times. Frank Lloyd Wright once called Walker ''the only other architect in America.''
Skyscrapers like 1 Wall Street and 140 West Street, she writes, ''highlight Walker's dramatic sense of the scale of architecture and his ability to soften its hard edges with beautifully rendered ornament.'' This book collects photographs, drawings and plans for many of his New York buildings, as well as images of their Art Deco-era interiors.
Gerard R. Wolfe, joined by the photographers Jo Renee Fine and Norman Borden, has completely overhauled ''The Synagogues of New York's Lower East Side'' (Empire State Editions, $29.95), originally published in 1978. This volume, which is illustrated with black and white photographs and has a foreword by The Times's Joseph Berger, uses historic houses of worship as a prism to explore immigrant life and culture. ''Grand Central: Gateway to a Million Lives'' (W. W. Norton, $50), is another handsome reissue, just in time for the terminal's 100th anniversary in 2013.
In his foreword to ''Magnificent Trees of the New York Botanical Garden'' (Monacelli Press, $50), Gregory Long, the garden's president, quotes Kahlil Gibran: ''Trees are poems that the earth writes upon the sky.'' It is a fitting epitaph for this collection of breathtaking color photographs by Larry Lederman, and essays by Mr. Lederman and Todd A. Forrest, both among the garden's extraordinary team of experts. This volume also provides an informative guide for amateur or professional landscapers, and is all the more valuable because some of the trees pictured, including the sweet gum on the cover, were damaged during Hurricane Sandy.

HEADLINE: Trading Up Can Be Hard to Do

BYLINE: By MICHELLE HIGGINS

 BODY:
EVEN with a hefty down payment, a perfect credit score and a top-notch broker, many New Yorkers who want to move to bigger and better apartments are having no luck. Stymied by a scarcity of listings and a tight credit market, even the most qualified buyers are being outbid, turned down for loans or simply can't find what they're looking for. As a result they are being forced to sit on the sidelines.
Moving up to a two-bedroom may be the biggest challenge. Sales have been relatively strong at the upper and lower reaches of the Manhattan market, but the middle, which is made up largely of two-bedrooms in the $1.4 million to $3 million range, shrank to 29.4 percent of the market in the third quarter, down from 37.9 percent in the same period last year, according to Jonathan J. Miller, the president of the appraisal firm Miller Samuel.
The same trend, he said, is playing out not just in New York City boroughs like Brooklyn and Queens, but also in coastal cities like Miami, San Francisco and Los Angeles, where trophy properties continue to be snapped up by investors, and where sales of studios and one-bedrooms continue to be strong, driven by first-time buyers taking advantage of record low mortgage rates and escaping high rents in the process. 
In the middle is what Mr. Miller describes as the ''doughnut hole'' of the housing market. ''They're looking at mortgage rates and are licking their lips because rates are so low,'' he said. But ''they can't trade up.''
Tara Jepson and Dan Eckstein are in the doughnut hole. They have great credit, steady incomes and a good-size down payment at hand, having recently sold their one-bedroom Chelsea apartment for cash. And though they are set on a two-bedroom or a one-bedroom with an office in Brooklyn, they are flexible when it comes to almost everything else.
''If it has outdoor space great, if it doesn't -- that's not a huge deal,'' said Ms. Jepson, 34, a director of strategy at an advertising agency. A doorman is not a requirement either. ''We would do a walk-up,'' she said. ''It doesn't need to have an elevator. We'll renovate, tear down the whole structure -- even if we can't move in for a year.''
But after a year and a half of aggressively looking, the couple still haven't been able to make a deal. And that's after broadening their search from South Williamsburg to nine other neighborhoods in Brooklyn and loosening their purse strings to a maximum of $1.5 million, up from their starting point of $800,000.
''I'm so frustrated,'' said Ms. Jepson, noting that most apartments in their price range were either ''chintzy,'' or in a residential-commercial space that made getting a loan tricky. ''I feel like we have great credit, all the financial documents and are willing to pay more, and we still can't find what we're looking for.''
They are far from alone. In Manhattan the number of two-bedroom listings has dwindled -- down 28.4 percent to 1,673 listings in the third quarter from the same period a year ago, according to Miller Samuel. But the underlying issue is low equity. The fall in prices since 2008 means that even if the apartment has appreciated in value, selling it may not result in enough extra money to get that homeowner into a bigger and better place at a price he or she can afford.
With down-payment requirements now firmly at 20 percent or more, rather than the 5 or 10 percent of a few years ago, Mr. Miller said, ''people need more cash to make the next move, and that's the challenge.'' Put another way, Mr. Miller said, ''they're stuck.''
Mitch and Shira Goldstein recently began looking in earnest for a two-bedroom after their large Upper East Side one-bedroom received three bids the week of the open house and went into contract more quickly than they expected for just shy of the $525,000 asking price.
''On the flip side,'' said Mr. Goldstein, an integrated sales director for a publishing company, available listings within their $725,000 budget have been disappointing. ''They were a little run down and it didn't seem like we would ever have as big or as nicely finished a place for the same price point that we had by staying.''
''We will probably rent for a year and continue to watch the market,'' Mr. Goldstein said.
Brokers say the scarcity of middle-market listings ensures fierce competition among buyers. ''In my almost decade-long career, I haven't seen inventory this low,'' said Stefanie Barlow, a vice president of the Corcoran Group who has been working with Ms. Jepson and Mr. Eckstein over the last year or so. She said she'd feel comfortable putting a property on the market on Dec. 21 -- a typically slow time in real estate -- ''and I think it would go that day if it was well priced.
''There are a lot of buyers out there,'' Ms. Barlow continued, ''and there is really nothing for them to purchase.'' And if they find a place that suits, they may be outbid. ''People are coming in all cash and over ask.''
Unable to find an apartment to move to, some prospective sellers are also waiting it out. ''I don't want to stress about my apartment selling and not having a place to go,'' said Karim Tartoussieh, a graduate student at New York University who for two months held off listing his prewar Chelsea one-bedroom while he searched for a two-bedroom for $1.5 million to $1.8 million.
But even though he hasn't found a new home, he listed the one-bedroom last week because he was convinced by his new broker, Anthony Santangelo, an executive vice president of Douglas Elliman working in the Greenwich Village office, that now is a good time to test the market.
Mr. Tartoussieh's initial hesitancy is not unusual. ''It's like being on a treadmill,'' said Stan Humphries, the chief economist of Zillow. ''First-time homebuyers get on and everyone steps forward to a higher realm of housing.'' But many repeat buyers, faced with tight credit and low to negative equity, can no longer afford that next step up in housing. As a result, he said, ''everything has ground to a halt.''
Another factor: Banks continue to offer the best rates only to candidates with the strongest credentials. Prospective borrowers who are self-employed or who receive a large portion of their income through commissions and bonuses meet with resistance -- even if they have high incomes and solid credit scores.
''One mortgage broker told me with 50 percent down I could get a loan, but my rate would be 'brutal,' '' said Shannon Aalai, a senior associate at Citi Habitats, who is self-employed and has zero debt, as well as a credit score of 790 and more than $100,000 saved for a down payment. ''It's the people that did everything right that are being punished for this. We weren't involved in the subprime mortgage crisis.''
Without a reasonable loan, she said, she watched as her dream apartment, a one-bedroom condo for $650,000 in the Gramercy area, came and went.
Other strictures on lending are also thwarting buyers. That's what Lynn Lussier, a technology sales executive who lives on the Upper West Side, found out earlier this year after putting down a deposit on a renovated one-bedroom listed for just under $800,000. Because the management company still owned more than 50 percent of the apartments in the building, few banks were willing to take the risk that the sponsor could default. The banks that did required a minimum of 30 percent down.
''I'm willing to put down 20 percent,'' Ms. Lussier said, ''but do I want 30 percent of my liquidity tied up in this apartment?'' She ended up renewing the lease on her $5,500-a-month one-bedroom in October. ''I kind of got very frustrated with the process,'' she said, ''and then it became an issue of low inventory -- there was really nothing out there I liked.''
Still, all hope is not lost. Aggressive buyers who can act fast are landing contracts. For roughly a year, Walter Saraniecki, 28, a commodities trader, has been scouring the listings for a two-bedroom two-bath apartment for $1.5 million to $2.5 million in Chelsea and visiting anything close to his parameters. His broker, Lindsey Owen of Town Residential, even set up a standing daily 4 p.m. appointment to discuss any new listings, in order to set up showings quickly. ''We probably looked at 150 to 200 apartments over the course of the year,'' she said.
In October, Mr. Saraniecki saw a listing for a renovated top-floor duplex with a private terrace, a block from the High Line. He was among the first in the door at the first open house.
''It was packed,'' he said. Mr. Saraniecki liked what he saw and offered to pay the asking price on the spot. ''We'll just take it,'' he recalls telling the seller's broker. ''Please, we'll take it.''
''If I didn't see so many of these places,'' he said, ''I don't know if I would have been as aggressive. We went into a deal with all of my paperwork within 12 hours of seeing the place. You really have to be confident you're making the right decision.''
Run, Don't Walk, and Other Tips
CONSIDER A LEASE-BACK Making the sale of your current place contingent on the option of renting the property from the buyers for a few months can help buy time to find a new place in a tight market. It may also eliminate extra moving costs.
GET IN EARLY Be the first at the door at the first open house. Web sites including nytimes.com/realestate, Streeteasy and Trulia allow hunters to save a search and will send you an e-mail for every new listing that meets your criteria.
BE PREPARED TO POUNCE Research comparable listings and make sure you have all your paperwork lined up, including mortgage preapproval and a snapshot of your finances, so you can make an offer on the spot.
FIND THE RIGHT TEAM Make sure you work with a responsive broker and a real estate lawyer who will get back to you promptly. M.H.

HEADLINE: A Feast for the Eyes Before Food Is Served

BYLINE: By JOANNE STARKEY

 BODY:
There are restaurateurs on Long Island who are better known than Tom Schaudel, but most of them have made their reputations in Manhattan. Mr. Schaudel is Long Island's homegrown restaurant king.
Born and raised in Carle Place, he had his first restaurant job there as a dishwasher. He later went to the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., and opened his first restaurant, Panama Hattie's, in Huntington in 1983; he sold it in the late 1980s, and it closed recently. In a phone conversation after my visits to his newest restaurant, the year-old Jewel in Melville, he estimated that he had owned 14 or 15 restaurants on Long Island.
Mr. Schaudel currently owns, with partners, three restaurants besides Jewel: CoolFish in Syosset, A Mano in Mattituck and A Lure in Southold. But Jewel, in the Rubie Corporate Plaza, is the brightest sparkler in his crown. Marc Beige, the owner of the building, is a partner in the restaurant. 
Jewel is also the largest of Mr. Schaudel's restaurants, with seating for 215, in addition to room for 150 in the atrium, located elsewhere in the building and usually used for private parties.
At Jewel, patrons enter a foyer with burbling fountains bathed in colored lights on both sides of the walkway. In the main dining room, strings of blown-glass balls hanging from the ceiling create a celebratory mood. (On both our visits, we heard more than one rendition of ''Happy Birthday.'')
Another highlight is the glassed-in kitchen, where diners can view the chefs at work. Mr. Schaudel is the one with long white hair and a bandanna, facing the kitchen, with his back to the dining room. He keeps an eye on everything leaving the kitchen, and it shows.
We had only minor quibbles with the food and none with the friendly, accommodating servers.
The meal starts with a basket of assorted warm, chewy rolls. On one occasion, the soup of the day -- seafood chowder with a rich broth -- was a worthy follow-up. The best appetizers, though, were the grilled octopus and the crab salad. The former was a mélange of tender tentacles, olives, capers, red onions and red grapes, all in a merlot vinaigrette. The salty tang of the olives and the sweetness of the grapes seemed to alternate in the mouth. The crab salad, big enough to share, featured lump crab, avocado and cucumber in a lemon aioli with a mango sauce on the plate.
The ''almost Caesar'' (without egg) was a chopped rendition and very tasty. I was less taken with the assembly of beets (roasted, poached, pickled, red and yellow); the sinus-clearing horseradish cream on the plate detracted from the earthy flavor of the beets.
Almost everything we tried was very well executed. Our favorite entree was the fork-tender, root-beer-braised short ribs with buttermilk smashed potatoes, baby carrots and pickled onions. Another top-notch main course was blackened catfish atop a tasso hash with Creole mustard on the plate. The udon noodles with red curry, seafood, baby carrots, purple potatoes and edamame were another hit, well seasoned with a slightly sweet yet punchy flavor. The sirloin steak was flavorful and nicely charred, but the onion rings on the plate were underdone and pasty.
There are five pizzas on the menu ($12 to $21). The millionaire's pizza is an appealing treat, and economical enough for nonmillionaires to order ($21). It starred black truffles, mushrooms and fontina cheese on a crisp crust, all crowned with a fried egg. (The combination works.)
This is the first Tom Schaudel restaurant I have visited that didn't have his signature chocolate bag on the dessert menu. We didn't miss it. We were very happy with the espresso cheesecake, the warm apple cobbler, the flourless chocolate cake over salted caramel sauce and the chocolate brownie paired with crème de menthe ice cream.
Jewel, festive to begin with, shines especially brightly in the holiday season.

DON'T MISS
THE SPACE Large, lovely restaurant seating 215, including a couple of small rooms that can be used for private parties. Full wheelchair access.

HEADLINE: Move Over, Yankees

BYLINE: By TYLER KEPNER

 BODY:
The real story, Stan Kasten insisted, is not the payroll. The resurrection of the Los Angeles Dodgers cannot be measured by the sum of their salaries, as staggering as that total has become.
''What's really happening here is the building of a franchise,'' Kasten, the team president, said last week from Dodger Stadium, which is undergoing an off-season makeover.
''Stadium infrastructure, organizational infrastructure -- those are the critical things on which long-term success is built.''
Since the end of their season, the 24th in a row without reaching the World Series, the Dodgers have added scouts to roam the world for talent. They have attracted decades of experience and wisdom to the front office by hiring people like Bob Engle, Gerry Hunsicker and Pat Corrales. Their new hitting coach is Mark McGwire. 
Yet all people talk about is the payroll, which seems to have no limits and has positioned the Dodgers as the West Coast version of the Yankees -- if the Yankees spent a little more. Even the Angels, who have lured Albert Pujols and now Josh Hamilton to Anaheim, cannot match the Dodgers in spending.
The Yankees have had the major leagues' highest payroll in each of the last 14 seasons, six times topping $200 million, according to Baseball Prospectus. But the Dodgers will hold the top spot in 2013, having committed more than $210.6 million to 21 players, with another $11.5 million owed to the departed Manny Ramirez and Andruw Jones. Barring trades, and including the undetermined salaries for younger players filling out the roster, the payroll almost certainly will be a major league record.
It is twice the payroll the new owners, led by Mark Walter, Magic Johnson and Kasten, inherited last May, when they bought the club for $2.15 billion. The Dodgers have made more than $600 million in salary commitments since then, transforming the culture of a team that was emerging from bankruptcy under the previous owner, Frank McCourt.
''I understand the questions about it,'' Kasten said. ''But no one quite understands the economics of, first of all, the transaction that we made and the resources available in terms of support -- whether it's support from fans buying tickets and hot dogs, the strategic partners who want to be aligned with us, or sponsorship and media partners. There are a lot of good things, and unique things, available in this market.''
Kasten would not address specifics of the Dodgers' finances, which have become increasingly confounding to rival executives who wonder how they can afford it all in absence of a firm commitment on a new television deal. Walter's company, Guggenheim Partners, is a global financial services firm that manages some $125 billion and used its Indiana-based insurance companies to pay for the team. A coming TV deal is presumably underwriting, and motivating, the spending spree.
More and more, local cable contracts are driving the industry because of the value of live programming in the DVR age. Fox will carry the Dodgers' local telecasts for one more season and has reportedly discussed a 25-year extension for $6 billion. But the Dodgers have other options, and thus negotiating leverage. They could switch to Time Warner or create their own network, as teams like the Yankees have done.
The Yankees have a roster full of must-see players, and the Dodgers have added several high-profile and well-paid stars since the middle of last season. They traded last summer for Hanley Ramirez, Josh Beckett, Carl Crawford and Adrian Gonzalez, and last week signed Zack Greinke for six years and $147 million, a $24.5 million annual average that is the highest for a pitcher on a multiyear deal. They also invested $61.7 million -- in a six-year contract and a posting fee -- for the South Korean left-hander Ryu Hyun-Jin.
Vince Gennaro, the author of ''Diamond Dollars: The Economics of Winning in Baseball'' and a consultant to several clubs, said: ''When you have the kind of TV deal on the table that's been discussed, and something like that is imminent, I think that goes hand-in-hand with spending to win on the field. I really don't think, in that context, it's irrational in any way. Before people get wind of the TV deal, they'll think that's a lot of payroll -- but not when you look at it in the context of what's at stake. I'm sure the media partners, if they're putting that kind of money out there, are not expecting the Dodgers to come up short in trying to win.''
Although the Dodgers have homegrown stars in Matt Kemp and Clayton Kershaw, the McCourt ownership spent little on player development, with a major-league-low $300,000 international budget in 2011. Last winter, with ownership in limbo, General Manager Ned Colletti was limited to low-cost additions like Chris Capuano and Jerry Hairston Jr.
Without much talent in the pipeline, Kasten said, it made sense to improve the major league roster immediately.
''We're playing catch-up, let's face it,'' he said. ''In the Los Angeles market, this team had a payroll of $90 million or so. Whether that's right or wrong, I don't know. But we had to play catch-up, and I wasn't going to stand here and tell the fans they're going to have to wait three to five years for our kids.''
The Dodgers will clearly exceed the luxury-tax threshold, probably for years to come. But they have less reason to be concerned about it than the Yankees, who are trying to get under the $189 million threshold in 2014. Unlike the Yankees, the Dodgers have not exceeded the threshold before and will face much lower tax penalties.
If the Yankees keep their payroll under $189 million in 2014, their tax rate for exceeding it in future years will be 17.5 percent, and they will receive a substantial rebate from the revenue-sharing pool. But if their payroll exceeds $189 million in 2014, they will be taxed at a 50 percent rate and forfeit the rebate.
Hal Steinbrenner and the Yankees' decision-makers have long believed that the team could spend less while maintaining a high payroll and still win championships, the way other teams do. Now they have strong financial incentive to carry out the plan.
For Kasten, who presided over the Atlanta Braves in their glory years and helped build the Washington Nationals, this is largely new territory. But the guiding principle, he said, never changes. The best-run organizations, not simply the wealthiest, are the ones that succeed.
Kasten noted that his Braves acquired each of their three aces in a different way: Tom Glavine through the draft, John Smoltz through a trade and Greg Maddux through free agency. Other stars, like Jones and Javy Lopez, were signed as amateurs on the international market. A team cannot simply write checks and plan parades.
''We're going to be using all the tools that we can, not just spending money,'' Kasten said. ''I always say smart beats rich. The Yankees got as good as they are because they're both smart and rich. We're working on it.''

HEADLINE: Falcons Seek New Dome, Not Atlanta Fixer-Upper

BYLINE: By MIKE TIERNEY

 BODY:
ATLANTA -- Arthur Blank became a billionaire in part by persuading people to renovate their homes rather than acquire new ones. He is a co-founder, and former president and chief executive of Home Depot, the global retail chain whose products and services are geared toward home improvement.
In his current business venture, Blank holds a different perspective. He craves a new home for his Atlanta Falcons, even though their current dwelling, the 21-year-old Georgia Dome, would remain suitable in the short term, perhaps with little more than touch-ups using items straight off the Home Depot shelves.
The Falcons are campaigning for a better stadium than the Dome, the site of Sunday's game against the Giants. It remains to be seen if the region's love for football will be enough to overcome its growing disdain for using taxpayer dollars to finance a new home for a lucrative sports franchise. 
The proposed financing equation for the estimated $1 billion project -- 70 percent from the Falcons, 30 percent from a local hotel-motel tax -- might be considerate to taxpayers when compared with those for other N.F.L. stadiums. Yet it has not been embraced even though nearly 9 of 10 people affected by the tax would be out-of-state visitors.
Blank is a popular man here. A native of Queens, N.Y., who moved to Atlanta in 1978, he and a partner started Home Depot, which ultimately landed him on the Forbes 400 list.
Since purchasing the Falcons in 2002, he has seen the team reach the playoffs six times, including this season, and the franchise is seen as a stable presence in the league. Blank is perceived as passionate, illustrated by the hugs and handshakes he dispenses along the bench late in games, along with competitive salaries to free agents. The last time the Falcons failed to sell out a game was 2007.
His well-known family foundation said it has donated $250 million to charitable entities, about 80 percent locally. And he has never entertained the notion of moving the team.
The stadium plan, which involves a retractable roof, could test his popularity. A recent poll found that only 15 percent of voters in Georgia believed the Falcons needed a new stadium and 75 percent opposed any public financing.
''That does matter to me,'' Blank said. ''If I were a citizen and could vote on this myself, if the public understood clearly that this is a billion-dollar investment for something that is state-owned, I'd be jumping up and clicking my heels.''
Blank acknowledged that the Georgia Dome, which would be demolished, remains functional. But with the bonds applied to its construction scheduled to be paid off in 2017, when the Falcons' lease will expire, he is hoping to secure a deal for the next three decades.
''We need a long-term solution to keep the Falcons competitive in terms of the fan experience,'' said Blank, alluding to attracting fans to games despite the rise of technology that makes viewing a game on TV at home an immersive experience.
While the Falcons would essentially operate the building, which would host the marquee sports events and concerts now held at the Dome, and retain all revenue, they would assume some risk, like cost overruns.
Before a recent game, some fans suggested that the most distasteful element to the financing formula were personal seat licenses, a one-time fee, often of thousands of dollars, that must be paid before season tickets can be purchased.
''To get nailed with a P.S.L., I can't afford to put up that kind of money,'' said Lee Day, a fan who has been attending Falcons games for decades.
Another fan added that paying a P.S.L. made it seem like ''you're leasing a condo.''
Offering no details, Blank indicated that the fees assessed in Atlanta would be lower than others around the N.F.L. -- the Giants charged from $1,000 to $20,000 for their P.S.L.'s. He cited a desire to maintain diversity at the games.
Studies have also concluded that seat prices rise an average of about 25 percent for the first season in new stadiums.
Only one apparent hurdle remains before construction begins on either of two designated downtown plots of land near the Dome.
The Falcons thought the way was cleared when the state legislature voted in 2010 to extend a hotel-motel tax to pay for the stadium. But current law caps the amount that can be devoted to bonds at $200 million, or about $100 million shy of the total needed from the tax for the project.
Legislators, some of whom were elected after the vote two years ago by pledging there would be no new taxes, would have to agree to raise that limit for design and construction to proceed.
Blank expressed optimism but said, ''I don't assume anything at this point.'' Mike Dudgeon, a state representative with the majority Republican Party in the House of Representatives, has persistently opposed taxes being used for a stadium.
Citing increasingly scarce public financing for education, transportation, juvenile justice and law enforcement, Dudgeon said: ''It is an extremely tough state budget environment. It is very difficult to make any case that we should make any investment in a new stadium to replace the Georgia Dome, which is only about 20 years old.''
Still, Dudgeon, a Falcons fan who watches most games at home with his son, said raising the bond limit ''will probably pass.''
Implicit in the debate is whether an owner whose net worth is $1.5 billion, according to Forbes, and whose team will likely increase in value with a new stadium, even one owned by the state that would stage other events, should finance it on his own.
''For me, what's fair to the public is zero financing,'' said Phil Porter, a sports economist at the University of South Florida who analyzes stadium financing. ''If every community in the U.S. would say no to pro sports, very little would change if we took their subsidy away.''
Porter contends that one potential benefit -- redevelopment in downtrodden neighborhoods where many stadiums are situated -- rarely materializes. He called the hotel-motel tariff that has minimal impact on locals as ''taxation without representation.''
Fair or not, the tax ''has the least political cost,'' said Mark Rosentraub, a University of Michigan sports management professor who consults with teams and cities on stadium financing arrangements. ''Hands down, it's the most favored form of tax: 'Tourists are paying it, and I don't care.' ''
Rosentraub asserted that taxpayers' contributions are justified ''if they were getting an appropriate return.''
He added, ''Our country is established on the notion of the public sector making investments.''
In keeping with the spirit of the home improvement goliath started by their owner, the Falcons considered renovating the Georgia Dome. The tab would have approached $900 million, according to Blank, nearly as much as for a new building.
Expressing a sentiment that would have sounded heretical in his previous career, Blank said, ''It didn't make any sense to do a remodeling job.''

HEADLINE: For Stock Investors, A Big Disconnect

BYLINE: By PAUL J. LIM. 
Paul J. Lim is a senior editor at Money magazine. E-mail: fund@nytimes.com

 BODY:
HEADING into 2013, worried investors seem to have plenty of sound reasons to consider paring back their exposure to domestic stocks.
With only two weeks remaining in 2012, Congress and the White House have made little headway on a deal to avoid the spending cuts and tax increases that are set to kick in at the end of December -- a jolt that economists say could send the economy into recession.
And even if this so-called fiscal cliff is averted, the economy is still expected to grow at only a tepid annual rate of 2 percent. Corporate earnings growth, meanwhile, has fallen from a rate of more than 17 percent in the third quarter of last year to just 2 percent today. And revenue among companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is essentially flat, a sign that the global economy is slowing. 
Although all these trends would appear to bode poorly for stocks, on the theory that a weak economy reduces investor appetite for risk, there's a problem with drawing that conclusion: History has shown that lousy economic conditions, or even dismal corporate results, don't necessarily lead to disappointing stock market returns in any given year -- or decade, for that matter.
When you buy stocks, you are ultimately buying a share in corporate profits, which are influenced by the overall economy. Nonetheless, the amount of growth in a country's gross domestic product shouldn't be confused with the prospects for its stock market, says Simon Hallett, chief investment officer at the asset management firm Harding Loevner. ''I cannot emphasize that enough,'' he says.
Investors need only look to the current year as an example. The domestic economy has grown at an annual pace only slightly above 2 percent, subpar by historical standards. Overseas, the picture is worse: Japan is teetering on the brink of yet another recession, large parts of Europe's economy are contracting and China's pace of growth has slowed uncomfortably.
Yet against this bleak backdrop, United States stocks have returned 15 percent, on average, this year, while those in Europe have gained 18 percent and Asian stocks are up more than 12 percent.
''If, at the beginning of 2012, you got a preview of all the headlines for the coming year, would you have believed the markets would be up this much?'' asks Pat Dorsey, president of Sanibel Captiva Investment Advisers.
Roger Aliaga-Díaz, senior economist at the Vanguard Group, says investors shouldn't be surprised about the seeming disconnect between basic economic variables and stock market performance.
He and his colleagues at Vanguard recently studied equities' returns going back to 1926, looking specifically at the predictive power of important variables.
Those include market price-to-earnings ratios, growth in gross domestic product and corporate profits, consensus forecasts for gross domestic product and earnings growth, past stock market returns, dividend yields, interest rates on 10-year Treasury securities, and government debt as a percentage of G.D.P.
Their conclusion was that none of these factors -- which investors often cite when explaining their moves -- come remotely close to forecasting accurately how stocks will perform in the coming year. ''One-year forecasts of the market are practically meaningless,'' Mr. Aliaga-Díaz says.
Even over a 10-year time horizon, considered by many investors to be long term, only P/E ratios had a meaningful predictive quality.
Since 1926, those ratios, based on 10 years of averaged earnings -- a gauge popularized by the Yale economist Robert J. Shiller -- explained roughly 43 percent of stocks' performance over the following decade. Of course, ''that means about 55 percent of the ups and downs in the market can't be explained by valuations,'' Mr. Aliaga-Díaz says.
What about economic fundamentals like G.D.P. and corporate earnings growth? Over the course of a decade, those factors had even less predictive power over future returns.
Are investors simply ignoring economic conditions and fundamentals?
No, Mr. Aliaga-Díaz says. He notes that information about historical trends, like those for G.D.P. and earnings, is already widely known on Wall Street. That means these trends are priced into the market before stock prices start to move over the next year or decade.
As for earnings and economic growth projections, ''those forecasts tend not to diverge too much from the consensus,'' he says. ''And consensus estimates for future growth are also already priced into the market.''
THAT may help explain why, despite all the storm clouds hanging over this economy, professional investors appear willing to look past the poor data. In fact, money managers say they are more bullish about domestic blue-chip stocks than about stocks in emerging markets or the rest of the developed world, according to a recent survey by Russell Investments.
John S. Osterweis, chairman and chief investment officer of Osterweis Capital Management, says that the economic head winds notwithstanding, several long-term trends could support a new leg to the bull market in domestic stocks.
Among them are a possible rebound in the housing sector, a potential revival of domestic manufacturing as wage growth accelerates in China, and the tail wind that could arise from the boom in domestic energy production.
Mr. Dorsey at Sanibel points to yet another possible tail wind. ''Think about what uncertainty causes,'' he said. ''It causes low expectations. And when is typically a good time to buy an asset class? When expectations and valuations are low.''

HEADLINE: Some Buildings Find Buyers Need a Nudge

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

 BODY:
WHETHER it's the best of times, or times are just O.K., could depend on whom you ask.
Some analysts see the recent trend of buying homes from floor plans as a sign that the market is fully back. Case in point: the mad dash for units at One57, the new Midtown condominium that is still an active construction site.
Others see a different reality, in which buyers are still skittish, and they cite the mixed bag of statistics from third-quarter sales -- some activity up, some prices down -- to prove their point. 
But some developers have a plan to get those reluctant buyers off the fence. They're dangling incentives, or discounts paid by the developer at closing, to seal the deal on apartments.
''They can get buyers across the finish line,'' said Eric Benaim, the chief executive of Modern Spaces, a brokerage.
To be fair, Manhattan's trendiest new condos aren't bending over backward to get buyers in the door.But some condos that tailor to middle-income buyers or are in still-gentrifying neighborhoods have again embraced the idea that every little enticement helps, especially with hard-to-unload remaining units.
Mr. Benaim is relying on incentives to help wrap up a pair of projects in Long Island City, Queens.
At L Haus, at 11-02 49th Avenue, buyers receive a credit equal to 6 percent of the unit's cost when completing a purchase, though it can be applied only to closing expenses. Under different circumstances the credit might have been just 5 percent, Mr. Benaim said, but the Stahl Organization, the developer, raised the amount to cover the state's so-called mansion tax, which is a 1 percent charge on any sale for $1 million and up.
Modern Spaces, which took over sales in January after replacing Douglas Elliman, started the incentive program in August. At the time, 20 of 123 units remained; since then 19 have sold.
Brokers temporarily suspended the program in September and October, which are normally strong sales months, but Mr. Benaim said buyers of six units told him that the incentives were the reason they took the plunge.
The incentive program at the Murano, at 519 Borden Avenue, takes a looser approach. At closing, buyers receive a 5 percent check from the development team, Hudson Equities and Jim Plotkin, and it has no strings attached. In other words, the money doesn't have to be spent on closing costs.
''You can use it to buy a car if you want to,'' said Mr. Benaim, who added that the credit applied only to two-bedrooms, since they are harder to sell in that market than one-bedrooms. The two-bedrooms cost $670,00 to $970,000.
The incentive program, which began in October, hasn't found any takers, but Hurricane Sandy deterred buyers last month, he added. The Murano, which opened in 2010, has 11 of its 76 units left.
Similarly, incentives help sell units that are on top floors, which are usually the most expensive, or on the bottom floors, which can lack light and views, said Richard Steinberg, a broker with Warburg Realty who handled sales at Twenty9th Park Madison. At 39 East 29th Street, the condomimium, developed by the Spanish company Espais Promociones Immobiliárias, started sales in 2007 but struggled to move its 144 units during the recession and its aftermath, Mr. Steinberg said.
In June, Espais began offering to pay for transfer taxes and lawyer fees. The result was a speedy eight sales in six months, to wrap up the project.
Brian Meier, a Douglas Elliman broker, has a bigger hill to climb with MeadowWood at Gateway in East New York, Brooklyn, but incentives are helping. For years, Fillmore Real Estate was in charge of sales at the 19-tower, 1,152-unit condo near the Belt Parkway, which Taconic Investment Partners converted from a 1960s rental complex. Over that period, Fillmore sold an average of seven units a month, for a total of about 500 units, Mr. Meier said. Apartments at MeadowWood, which have granite counters and bamboo floors, start at around $120,000.
But since September, when Douglas Elliman came aboard, the sales rate has shot up to 16 a month, an increase that Mr. Meier attributed to incentives.
Though Fillmore had offered seller's concessions of up to 6 percent of the sale price to be spent on closing costs, Douglas Elliman came up with new ways of allocating the money. Among them are programs that cover common charges in advance as well as a ''1-1-1 buydown,'' which pays the equivalent of one point of a buyer's mortgage interest rate for the first three years. On a typical three-bedroom at MeadowWood, that can translate into more than $10,000 in savings, Mr. Meier said.
Incentives may take money out of developers' pockets, he said, but ''you would spend the money on advertising anyway.''

HEADLINE: Diplomacy, Jurassic-Style

BYLINE: By YONI BRENNER. 
Yoni Brenner is a writer for film, television and print.

 BODY:
''The small, insect-eating lizard was discovered in the badlands of northeastern Montana -- its fossil preserved in an area called the Hell Creek formation ... Some 65 million years ago, it went extinct. And now, it is named for the 44th president of the United States: Obamadon gracilis.'' -- The Boston Globe, Dec. 10
Good afternoon, everybody. Please take a seat. Folks, we are facing a crisis. I'm not talking about climate change or meteor showers or a distant supervolcano. No, the challenge that we face is one of principles and resolve, and whether we can put our differences aside and unite for the good of everyone. That requires compromise. But mostly, it requires that some dinosaurs -- and I don't want to point fingers here -- but some dinosaurs are going to have to stop eating other dinosaurs. 
Yesterday I met with representatives from the stegosaur and diplodocus communities. Today I'm having a box lunch with the pterodactyls. Everyone has different priorities and viewpoints, but what we can all agree on is the need to come together, and also the need not to worry that the moment we turn our backs or doze off that the opposition is going to eat us.
Our side is willing to compromise, we've done it before, we'll do it again. But you've got to compromise, too; and that means not licking your chops and not making ''mmmmmm'' sounds every time we sit down together. That means not constantly trying to lead us into tar pits or deadly velociraptor ambushes. That means not grandstanding about vague, unspecified spending cuts while your friends quietly de-bone us with their eyes. That's right. We can totally tell when you guys do that.
Now I understand that you have sharp teeth and binocular vision, and I understand that we are, for lack of a better word, ''delicious.'' I also know that many of you have signed a pledge that stipulates that under no circumstances will you make a deal that inhibits your ability to eat us with savage impunity. On the other hand, if we continue eating one another at this rate we're all going to die out. That seems like a pretty hefty price to pay just for a pledge.
So here's what I propose: for 98 percent of dinosaurs -- sauropods, ornithopods, thyreophora, what have you -- there'll be no change. You can continue consuming just as you have for the past eight million years. But the big guys -- the tyrannosaurs, the carnosaurs, those of you who are snarfing down five to six reptiles a day and popping those new mammal things like jujubes -- we're going to ask you to cut back a little. That's not because I'm a socialist or because I hate success. But because economists have proved that a successful America is founded on medium-size dinosaurs, and they can't thrive if they're being suddenly and violently feasted upon.
Look, I'm not going to pretend that this is easy. But I believe that we can find common ground. In that spirit, I want to tell you about a letter I received over the weekend, from an allosaurus in southern Wyoming. He told me that he was a carnivore, and that he didn't much care for my politics, but like me, he's worried about extinction, and said he would be willing to make certain sacrifices to serve the greater good. He also mentioned that he wanted to eat me. Which, I'll admit, was discouraging.
Nevertheless, I am optimistic that we can make a deal. Although we may be divided by class and diet and pelvic structure, we all must live here together. And as long as we remember that, as long as we continue to value principles over pledges, and shared ideals over violent feasting, I promise you, my friends, we will never, ever, go extinct.

HEADLINE: Foreseeing the Issues In Medicare's Future

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
The projected growth of Medicare costs is the single biggest contributor to the country's long-term budget deficits, many estimates show. No cohort of Americans, with the possible exception of the very affluent, pays enough in Medicare taxes and premiums to cover its eventual Medicare costs.
Much of the early public discussion of the fiscal deadline has focused on taxes, and the decline of tax rates in recent decades has played a crucial role in creating the deficit. But the question of how to reduce the growth of Medicare costs will become increasingly important as the population continues to age and health costs continue to increase. 
In the current fiscal talks, Republicans are pushing for significant changes to Medicare, in exchange for agreeing to tax increases. Democrats are arguing that Medicare is not the most pressing budget problem.
What follows is a primer on Medicare costs.
Q. Is Medicare really a bigger long-term problem than Social Security or military spending?
A. Yes. Over the next 25 years, the Congressional Budget Office projects that Medicare spending will rise to 6.7 percent of the gross domestic product, from 3.7 percent this year. (Other federal health care spending - like Medicaid, the insurance program principally for low-income families - is projected to rise to 3.7 percent of the G.D.P. in 2037, from 1.7 percent this year.)
In total, health care spending's percentage of the G.D.P. is expected to rise by five points. Social Security spending is projected to rise by only 1.2 percentage points, to 6.2 percent in 2037. All other federal spending is expected to shrink by two percentage points, to 9.6 percent.
These estimates assume that some current policies continue, rather than that the various tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1 occur and remain in place.
Q. Why is Medicare the big problem?
A. As much attention as the aging of society receives, the rise of medical costs is a bigger budgetary problem. The faster growth of Medicare costs, relative to Social Security costs, highlights this difference.
Social Security costs will indeed grow in coming years, adding to the government's fiscal problems. But those costs will not grow nearly as rapidly as Medicare's, because Medicare costs are a function of both the aging society and the cost of treating any one person. Social Security's costs stem almost entirely from the number of elderly people.
Q. Don't most Americans pay for their Medicare benefits, through payroll taxes over their working lives?
A. No, and it is not even close. Two married 66-year-olds with roughly average earnings over their lives will end up paying about $122,000 in dedicated Medicare taxes through the payroll tax, including the part their employers pay, according to Eugene Steuerle, Stephanie Rennane and Caleb B. Quakenbush of the Urban Institute. That married couple can expect to receive about three times as much - $387,000, adjusted for inflation - in benefits. The projected gap is even larger for younger people because of growing health care costs.
In short, the single biggest cause of the long-term deficit is that most people receive much more from Medicare than they give to it.
Q. Why are health costs growing so rapidly?
A. For a good reason and a bad one.
The good reason is that our medical system has made enormous progress in recent decades and can treat conditions that once would have killed people. Cancer treatment and cardiac care are two examples of areas with beneficial new treatments that are often not cheap. An American who turns 65 today can expect to live almost 20 more years on average, up from about 16 years in 1980.
The bad reason is that our health care system wastes large amounts of money. The United States spends roughly twice as much money per person on health care as many other rich countries, without getting vastly better results. Americans receive better care in some areas (some cancers) and worse in others (higher error rates).
It is hard to make the case that the American health system provides a good return on the money it spends. Life expectancy is higher and has grown over the last 30 years in Australia, Britain, Canada, France, Germany and Japan, among other countries.
Q. What are the possible solutions?
A. For starters, we could pay more in taxes. Tax revenues are near a 60-year low as a share of the G.D.P. They will rise somewhat as the economy recovers and incomes increase, but not by nearly enough to pay for growing health care costs.
Covering the future costs of Medicare and Medicaid solely through higher taxes would involve sharp increases - much greater than anything being debated now. So most budget experts believe that changes to Medicare need to be part of the deficit solution.
Among the options are raising the eligibility age, which is now 65; reducing benefits for affluent families; introducing more competition; and paying for quality of care, rather than quantity.
Q. What are the upsides and downsides of each?
A. Let's take the options one at a time:
The main arguments for raising the eligibility age are that Americans live longer than they used to and that the 2010 health care law makes it easier for people to get insurance if they do not receive it from an employer. The main counterargument is that the longevity increase has been smallest for low-income people, who are most likely to benefit from Medicare coverage.
Reducing benefits for high-income families has some bipartisan support, given the recent increases in income inequality. But some Democrats worry that it could eventually undermine Medicare's popularity, making it more akin to a welfare program.
Many Republicans advocate for more competition in health care, noting that competition has reduced prices and raised the quality of service in many industries. It has an uneven record of doing so in health care, though, in part because insurers can often profit by denying care.
Paying for quality rather than quantity has support from many economists. But it is not always easy. Patients and doctors often want to proceed with high-cost care even when research has not shown it to be effective.
Q. Does Medicare need to be fixed before Jan. 1?
A. Obviously not. Many potential changes would need to be phased in and would not bring savings for years. Other policy changes, like tax increases, can have a quicker effect on the deficit.
On the other hand, fixing Medicare is never going to be easy. Every budget negotiation between Congress and the president is an opportunity for them to make progress on a fiscal problem that is growing every year.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Curtain Falls, But Operas Reverberate

BYLINE: By STEVE SMITH

 BODY:
AS I look back over the concerts, productions and developments that made an impact in 2012, two operas loom largest in my estimation. One, ''Einstein on the Beach,'' by Philip Glass and Robert Wilson, must have felt like the death and rebirth of the art form when it first appeared in 1976. (Hard for me to say, not having been there.) The other, ''Dog Days,'' by David T. Little and Royce Vavrek, received its premiere this year. Compared with ''Einstein'' it was defiantly traditional. 
Both were extraordinary. Both left me emotionally drained, but for very different reasons.
Encountering ''Einstein'' in person for the first time during its Brooklyn Academy of Music revival in September, I instantly remembered something the composer Nico Muhly said about another of Mr. Glass's works in a 2007 article in The New York Times : ''There's a generation for whom the first chord in 'Music in 12 Parts' is totally, totally, totally an emotional moment.'' More than one generation, actually, since I am older than Mr. Muhly but felt exactly what he described when the Philip Glass Ensemble played ''Music in 12 Parts'' at the Park Avenue Armory in February.
That I felt it again in ''Einstein'' was partly a result of expectation. Having lived with recordings, photographs and firsthand accounts of the work for 25 years, I was ready to see its contemplative dreaminess and whimsical exuberance enacted by a committed, assured ensemble.
Like Zachary Woolfe, whose essay in The Times about ''Einstein'' described similar circumstances, I recognize now that the piece preserves in amber an isolated bubble of optimism and cross-pollination among personalities active in New York during the 1970s. But instead of feeling disappointed I was elated to find that the pell-mell jumble of sensations they constructed (and gingerly revised this year) still conveys sensations of newness, strangeness and audacity.
''Dog Days,'' by contrast, extends a path opera has followed from its inception. Mr. Vavrek's libretto transforms an apocalyptic short story by Judy Budnitz with poetic efficiency and caustic verisimilitude. Mr. Little's music, passingly redolent of church hymns and rock songs, illuminates and amplifies characters, situations and emotions with vividness and deft assurance.
For the work's premiere at Montclair State University in October the director Robert Woodruff and his sharp technical collaborators fashioned an imaginatively economical staging, with moments of unshakable horror and indomitable joy among its queasy domestic friezes. The results proved beyond any doubt that opera has both a relevant present and a bright future, provided that creative teams like this one are celebrated and nurtured.

HEADLINE: Sending Natural Gas Abroad

 BODY:
A new and long-awaited report from the Department of Energy has concluded that the government should quickly begin easing restrictions on the export of natural gas to take advantage of the vast new discoveries of a fuel that only a decade ago was in relatively short supply in this country. 
Exporting natural gas is a controversial issue, with powerful forces on both sides. But we are persuaded by the report's core finding that the benefits of selling gas to other countries would more than offset the modestly negative impact of higher prices for domestic users of the fuel.
The United States has traditionally maintained tight control over the export of natural gas, a fuel that it once imported, allowing it to be sold only in cases deemed to be in the ''public interest.'' But those restrictions have become anachronistic.
Production from shale gas fields has swelled American reserves and driven down prices by two-thirds since 2008. American natural gas is now among the cheapest fuels anywhere in the world and costs as little as one-fourth of what the fuel sells for in Europe and Asia.
There will be trade-offs to lifting the export restrictions. On the plus side, the report says that exports of gas in liquefied form could provide a $47 billion boost to the economy by 2020, including the construction of gas terminals. While the report dwells largely on economic issues, exports would also help to lower emissions linked to global climate change by giving countries like India, China, Japan and Germany access to a cleaner energy source than coal.
Greater gas exports could also factor into American foreign policy. By offering countries like India and China access to cheap American gas, Washington could make it more palatable for them to join in supporting sanctions against Iran, for instance. And it could give the United States new leverage in trade negotiations.
The main opposition comes from chemical and fertilizer companies that are big users of natural gas, and from consumers who fear higher prices. With more gas headed to foreign shores, domestic supplies of the fuel are expected to fall, driving up its price. But prices would still be well below their 2008 levels, and they would rise only gradually, over the course of several years.
A second objection comes mainly from some environmental groups that regard fracturing, the technique used to extract gas from deep shale formations, as environmentally dangerous. These concerns are best addressed by much tighter regulation of gas production, not by restricting exports.
There is no certainty that the Obama administration will approve more than a few new liquefied natural gas terminals, which take several years to build. But 15 new terminals have been proposed by the industry. Of these, four are scheduled to receive regulatory decisions in 2013. At the very least the administration should give the green light to the four that are pending and accelerate the review process for the rest.

HEADLINE: Groups Disagree on Why Spending Cap Is Needed

BYLINE: By AMAN BATHEJA. 
abatheja@texastribune.org

 BODY:
A coalition of Republican leaders and conservative groups agrees that the Texas Constitution could use a tighter cap on state spending.
Where they disagree is why such an amendment is needed.
Officials including Gov. Rick Perry and Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst say they want to amend the Constitution to limit spending growth to the combined rate of population and inflation to keep Texas running conservatively, as they say it has been for years. Currently, the Constitution restricts spending to the typically higher rate of growth in state personal income.
''We need to make constitutionally sure the fiscal conservatism that got us to where we are now will continue in the decades to come,'' Mr. Perry said in September. 
Some prominent conservative activists say the proposal is about ending the excessive spending growth that has occurred over the last 20 years.
''The 2012-13 Texas state budget is a welcome break from that trend, but with the threat of a national recession looming, now is not the time to lose fiscal discipline,'' read a statement sent out last month and signed by leaders of groups like the Texas Public Policy Foundation and Americans for Prosperity-Texas.
From 1992 to 2010, the two-year budgets passed by Texas lawmakers have roughly tripled in size, to $187.5 billion from $62.8 billion. The budget grew an average of 3.9 percent every two years once inflation and population gains were factored in.
The trend shifted sharply last year largely because of a multibillion-dollar shortfall. The current $173.5 billion budget represented a sharp cut in financing but was also widely viewed as incomplete. Medicaid, for instance, was underpaid by nearly $5 billion. When the Legislature convenes in January, lawmakers plan to pass a supplemental budget that will add billions to the current budget's final tally.
''The rule of thumb has been pretty much look and see how much money we have to spend and spend it,'' said Talmadge Heflin, a budget expert with the Texas Public Policy Foundation and a former legislator. ''Last couple of sessions, at least the last one, they've had to prioritize more because the money hasn't been there.''
When talking about the state's budget growth, Texas Republican lawmakers point a finger at federal mandates and entitlement programs. Instead of the full budget, they tend to praise the smaller growth in general revenue spending, the portion of the budget over which state officials have the most discretion. Not counting the current budget, general revenue spending, adjusted for population growth and inflation, has grown an average of less than 1 percent every two years since 1992.
''What is driving the growth is Medicaid, and that is being made by decisions in Washington, not decisions that state lawmakers made,'' said Dale Craymer, the president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association.
The debate among Republicans over the state's fiscal record exposed deep fissures in the party during this year's primary. In his losing bid for United States Senate, Mr. Dewhurst vowed to bring the ''Texas model'' of fiscal restraint to Washington, a promise that was mocked by the winner, Ted Cruz, who had the support of Tea Party groups.
''In his entire tenure in elected office, he has never once cut one penny from the state budget,'' Mr. Cruz said during a televised campaign debate.
At the time, Mr. Dewhurst accused Mr. Cruz of lying. Last month, Mr. Dewhurst said critics were still misinforming Texans about the state's budget history.
''We have kept our spending as low as possible while, in my judgment, still funding our priorities,'' he said, ''and not enough credit is given to the members of the Legislature for that.''

HEADLINE: Considering the Arts for Their Economic Benefits

BYLINE: By REEVE HAMILTON. 
rhamilton@texastribune.org

 BODY:
SAN ANGELO -- Just south of the river that runs through this West Texas city, Howard Taylor stood in front of a row of brightly painted buildings on a leafy brick sidewalk that will soon be dotted with streetlamps.
''Two years ago, people wouldn't come near this area,'' said Mr. Taylor, the director of the city's Museum of Fine Arts. ''They thought it was run-down, scary and unpleasant.''
The refurbished block is merely a hint of Mr. Taylor's vision for the city's 200-acre cultural district, a designation granted by the Texas Commission on the Arts in 2009. Mr. Taylor, the district's chairman, has ambitious plans to transform the area, which already includes historic Fort Concho and a growing number of art galleries but is also home to several abandoned buildings he would like to see restored.
These aspirations take money: by Mr. Taylor's estimates, some $41 million. And while the cultural district designation has been a nice stamp of approval -- Mr. Taylor refers to it as the ''connecting tissue'' of the revitalization effort -- it has come with no financing or access to state economic development incentives. 
''It is this absolute gem of potential,'' he said, ''and we're beginning to forget the potential it has.''
That could change in the state legislative session that begins in January. An aggressive effort is afoot to reframe the Texas Commission on the Arts as an engine for economic development and to give Texas' designated cultural districts access to existing state incentive funds.
But persuading lawmakers in the state to invest in the arts has proved challenging with the tight budgets of recent years. Last session, they slashed the commission's budget by 56 percent, down to $3.7 million for the 2012 fiscal year.
''We're being underutilized,'' said Gary Gibbs, the commission's executive director. ''We have great potential to benefit the state, and with more resources we would be in a much better position to fulfill our mission and benefit all people of Texas.''
A recent report issued by the Sunset Advisory Commission, which gauges the effectiveness of state agencies, supports that notion. It gave the arts agency high marks and recommended that lawmakers continue to support it, in part to stimulate the economy.
A recent statewide study by economic analysis firm TXP found that in 2011, arts and culture industries generated roughly $290.1 million in state sales tax revenue.
''What we're looking at now is institutionalizing the arts as a tool for economic development for the state of Texas,'' said Amy Barbee, the executive director of the Texas Cultural Trust, a nonprofit organization that raises and manages money for the arts commission. ''The cultural districts can be a vehicle for that.'' (Texas Cultural Trust is a corporate sponsor of the Texas Tribune.)
Texas is one of 12 states that play a formal role in establishing local cultural districts. The Legislature authorized the program in 2005, though no districts were designated until 2009, when an inaugural group that included San Angelo received the distinction.
So far, out of 27 communities that have completed applications for cultural district designation, 14 have been successful. Five other pre-established districts, including the Dallas arts district and the Houston museum district, were grandfathered in, avoiding the rigorous application process.
Though the cultural district designation does not come with any direct financial benefits, acceptance into the program provides a legitimacy that can be a boon to a community's efforts to market itself and secure outside financing. ''When you have this designation, it has significant meaning,'' said Martha J. Terrill, who led a group that secured cultural district status for a section of Galveston this year. ''Texas is not the only place you can get funding.''
But Ms. Barbee said there was existing state incentive money that could be leveraged by cultural districts as part of Texas' broader economic development strategy. She suggested that cultural districts be invited to seek financing from the state agriculture department's rural economic development program, for example, or from the economic development and tourism programs operated by the governor's office.
A collaboration between the Cultural Trust and the state agriculture department -- one that will focus on rural economic development and may include communities designated as cultural districts -- is already under way.
''We hope to increase tourism, attract new capital investment, create new job opportunities and bring attention to the cultural assets of rural communities,'' said Bryan Black, a spokesman for the agriculture department.
Ms. Barbee said she would like lawmakers to expand the approved uses for certain local sales tax dollars to include arts facilities.
Carlton Schwab, the president and chief executive of the Texas Economic Development Council, said his organization supported directing some sales tax revenue to arts activities.
Ryan Stubbs, research director at the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies in Washington, said states were increasingly setting up cultural district designation programs without attaching fiscal incentives. But he said states that had included financing, like New Mexico and Louisiana, were clearly benefiting.
Catherine Frazier, a spokeswoman for Gov. Rick Perry, said the governor was pleased with the state's current economic development strategy but would consider re-evaluating how the arts were financed in Texas if that should be the will of the Legislature.
In San Angelo, Mr. Taylor says he would welcome any help his cultural district can get. He envisions several museums, restaurants and businesses, vocational training programs in boot and saddle making and -- perhaps most important -- a pedestrian-friendly community that is valued by its residents as well as visitors.
''To me, that's what a cultural district is about,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''It's not about culture with a capital C. It's about how we live together and how there's a real sense of everybody belonging and sharing in this.''
Rick Weise, San Angelo's assistant city manager and the district's co-chairman, agreed that it would aid the city's efforts to attract business. ''A lot of economic development is your relationship with whoever you're trying to bring in,'' he said. ''But secondly it's what do they see and do they like that?''
Despite some successful projects, there is still much to be accomplished, and Mr. Taylor knows it. Right now, he said, he is still working to get the basics.
''If you drive around, you don't know it's fabulous,'' he said. ''There's virtually no signage. It looks a little bit like a dump. There's nothing to tell you you're in a place that's unique.''

HEADLINE: Please Don't Mess With the Charitable Deduction

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. SHILLER. 
Robert J. Shiller is professor of economics and finance at Yale.

 BODY:
WHATEVER else we do about the tax code, we need to save the charitable deduction, which has done so much good in our country and springs directly from some of our deepest values.
That deduction is in danger of being altered or even eliminated. The Bowles-Simpson Report of 2010, for example, called for replacing the charitable deduction with a small tax credit, and defended the change on the principle that we should ''lower rates, broaden the base'' and ''simplify the tax code.''
That guiding principle was also cited at the time of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, and echoes of it are heard increasingly today. 
But it should not be our defining principle, even if it would help promote economic growth. After all, our nation has been defined as both self-reliant and charitable. We trust one another, and not just the government, to make important decisions and to take action. Self-reliant does not mean selfish: while it is important that we manage our personal finances responsibly, we also have a deep tradition of giving to others. Many of us believe that we have obligations to others that only we can interpret, through our own consciences.
In fact, in 2011 the Charities Aid Foundation of Britain ranked the United States No. 1 among countries globally in its World Giving Index. Religious organizations, universities and colleges and other social groups rely highly on voluntary contributions. The generosity of individual Americans is a good part of the reason that churches are so active in our communities, that our universities are the best in the world, and that we have practically the only significant, small, private liberal arts colleges on the planet.
We have to clear our minds of the idea that the charitable deduction is a ''loophole'' that benefits the rich at society's expense. Income that is freely given away should not even be considered as taxable income.
Yes, the wealthy use this deduction more often, and give greater amounts of money. But society benefits. And beyond the money involved, the tax break for donors conveys a sort of official recognition, and encourages a habit and a culture of giving.
We don't rely on government to set all of our goals -- even our social goals, our wishes for the nation's future. The essential question we all must answer is how we can achieve the good society.
Of course, our motivations aren't always altruistic. Wealth is often pursued to increase social status. Thorstein Veblen developed this idea in ''The Theory of the Leisure Class,'' the 1899 book that coined the term ''conspicuous consumption'' -- the kind of consumption that is intended to impress others.
But people can also achieve status by giving away their incomes. I would call it conspicuous philanthropy. They give money to build hospitals and schools and university libraries, all with their names on them. They can also give away money directly to people they know, offering to pay personally for a neighborhood tree planting or cleanup. In many cases, even though the donor's name isn't displayed, the neighbors know who it is. To the mature mind, that kind of recognition can be even better than conspicuous consumption.
Gift-giving has a long history. Marcel Mauss, in ''The Gift'' in 1924, and Karl Polanyi, in ''The Great Transformation'' in 1944, argue that reciprocal gift-giving -- giving with some hope of recognition or response -- has pervaded healthy human society from its Neolithic beginnings. Using experiments involving brain imaging, recent research by Tania Singer of the Functional Imaging Laboratory of University College London and Professor Ernst Fehr of the University of Zurich has shown that reciprocity is supported by fundamental structures in the brain. We need to interpret our principles for society around these insights.
Undoubtedly, charitable giving can substitute for a good part of the things that the government would otherwise be doing itself, a factor that is rarely introduced into budget calculations. Indeed, in many cases, individual philanthropy may be more effective than government expenditures.
People with strong local knowledge, for example, may be better able to direct money to worthy recipients. And such giving eliminates the common resentment that government is taking one's money and distributing it in ways that don't correspond to our individual values.
SOME of the greatest moments in American history have been acts of charity -- whether public or private. One huge example was the Marshall Plan of aid to Europe after World War II. In 1947, George C. Marshall, then the secretary of state, challenged Americans to ''face up to the vast responsibility which history has clearly placed upon our country.'' This and other programs from 1948 to 1953 involved outright grants to Europe and other countries around the world, amounting to a net $33 billion, or 2 percent of total gross domestic product for that period. Those grants are still widely remembered today.
Instead of curtailing the charitable deduction, we should be aiming to make it an even bigger part of our culture. Charitable giving in the United States, although healthier than in other countries, is still not all that high. Using data from Giving USA, we see that total individual giving in the United States -- including giving by those who don't declare it on their tax returns -- was only 1.9 percent of disposable personal income in 2011. Compare that with the traditional Christian, Jewish and Islamic standards of 10 percent!
We can take steps like giving the charitable deduction to taxpayers who don't itemize deductions -- as was temporarily and partly allowed with the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 -- so that these people, too, are more encouraged to give. We should also set up a system so that charitable contributions can be deducted automatically on an individual W-2 form, so we don't have to go through the nuisance of collecting information and detailing it at tax time.
And we have to get out of the mind-set that tax simplification is always a good idea. With modern information technology, we can replace simplification with automation.
Unfortunately, there is good reason to suspect that American income inequality will grow further in coming years. Preserving and strengthening the charitable deduction will help thwart the resentment and social unrest caused by that inequality, while reinforcing generosity as a national value.

THE ENTERTAINERMovies, Magic, and My Father's Twentieth Century
By Margaret TalbotIllustrated. 418 pp. Riverhead Books. $28.95.THE NOIR FORTIESThe American People From Victory to Cold WarBy Richard LingemanIllustrated. 420 pp. Nation Books. $29.99.
First, let me dispel the curse of the two-book review. These ambitious works of cultural history are in no way a forced pairing. Both ''The Entertainer'' and ''The Noir Forties'' examine political and sociological shifts in America at large, viewing Hollywood as a generator of dreams that at once mirrors and shapes the collective unconscious -- as well as a company town run by despotic bosses.
The books highlight different decades. Margaret Talbot concentrates on the 1930s, when her father, the actor Lyle Talbot, reached his peak of orbiting with the stars. Richard Lingeman deals with the moods of paranoia and insecurity following World War II. Even here, however, differences fade as both authors show a keen sense of context, the way two decades reach backward and forward and Hollywood repeats itself with variations. 
The studio heads were ever weak-kneed in the face of pressure. They caved in to a public outcry over morals in the Depression years by rigidly enforcing a puritanical Production Code. In the struggles to form guilds and later unions, actors were repeatedly crushed by the moguls, often in collusion with the mob. Embracing rather than resisting the sweeping tide of anti-Communism in the 1940s and '50s, the studios invented the blacklist, and virtually invited the House Committee on Un-American Activities -- another form of mob intimidation -- to investigate their own writers.
One last uncanny parallel is the centrality to both narratives of the Midwest, an area with its own distinct character and peculiarities. Lingeman, an editor at The Nation and the author of biographies of Sinclair Lewis and Theodore Dreiser, was born in Indiana and is a veteran of the Korean War. He has a natural sympathy for farm and small-town boys caught up in the horrors of battle. And Lyle grew up in Nebraska, where he plied his trade in the raunchier alleyways of show business.
Lingeman's experiences with the Army Counter Intelligence Corps from 1954 through 1956 begin and conclude ''The Noir Forties,'' but otherwise his is straight history, while ''The Entertainer'' is more memoir, interweaving Talbot's family story with the portrait of Lyle as actor and emblem.
The youngest child of her father's fifth and most enduring marriage (an understatement as the others seem to have expired before they ever began), Margaret, who is a staff writer for The New Yorker, was born in 1961 to a man old enough to be her grandfather. As a little girl she wasn't interested in his stories of the '20s and '30s, as unimaginably distant as the Middle Ages, but fortunately he lived long enough to spark his daughter's interest and reportorial skills.
Talbot père comes across as a sort of Zelig-with-personality, a life-embracing man whose career spans, and illuminates, the first 60 years of the 20th century. When opportunity knocks, Lyle is already halfway through the door, cheerfully ready to adapt to every new form and possibility popular culture throws his way. From midway barker in a local carnival to bumbling magician to hypnotist's subject to traveling roadshow mainstay to actor in a theater troupe specializing in melodrama, Lyle is there. He moves on when these Victorian specialties become passé. And when the talkies beckon, handsome Lyle is ready for his close-up. He may have lacked introspection, as his daughter repeatedly reminds us (hardly unusual for an actor), but he ''knew enough about acting to appreciate that this was a new era in which personality, passion and good looks mattered more than perfect elocution or grandiosity.'' At the same time, he was a consummate professional, whose main concern was to give patrons their money's worth, being ''one of that generation of actors that did not expect to live like royalty.''
He landed in Hollywood in the early '30s, that sparkling pre-Code blip in film history when movies were wild and sexy, sin and violence went unpunished and the star system was in its infancy. He signed on at Warner Brothers, the scruffiest studio, makers of fast-paced and unpretentious grabbed-from-the-headlines movies rooted in urban grit and glamour. Warners' star-making machinery whirled into gear, first touting Lyle as a Gable type. With his slick black hair, broad face and easy grin (not to mention good teeth and a ready-made marquee name), he actually looked more like Gable than Gable -- at least the pre-makeover Gable. Perhaps because ''Lyle often conveyed a bit of foppishness, a juvenile quality,'' as she puts it, the arbiters of image subsequently decided he was more the sophisticated indoor type.
When partnered with Kay Francis (''Mary Stevens, M.D.'') and Carole Lombard (''No More Orchids'') or Bette Davis (''Fog Over Frisco''), he comes across as puppy-dog eager to please. In real life, his taste in women ran to smart and somewhat outrageous dames who would do and say things he wouldn't dare. He thus makes a perfect, pliable partner to those headstrong divas riding the winds of the previous decade's enfranchisement and social liberation.
Shrewdly and with dispassion, Talbot analyzes the factors that may have prevented him from becoming a major player -- possibly (as he thought) his activities as a founder of the Screen Actors Guild, or more probably (in her view) the lack of that ineffable something that makes for star quality. His looks were a little too regular, his affable personality registered no hint of conflict or contradiction -- or what Talbot calls ''the paradoxical quality that often makes a star.'' By my reading, Warners -- and he -- never did quite settle on his type. When playing the lover, he looks like a lounge lizard; when portraying a gangster, he resembles a Boy Scout. When was the last time you saw a bank robber neatly packing a suitcase before going on the lam (''Heat Lightning'')? His is simply not the face you want to keep watching, or remember afterward. The one exception is his memorable role as a sleazily handsome lowlife in the Warners gem ''Three on a Match,'' where he lures Ann Dvorak away from her husband and into a life of sex, drugs and child abuse, shocking even by early '30s standards.
He counted himself lucky to have regular work, hardly a fate worse than death when you consider the odds. Talbot cites a trade paper's tracking of the year 1934: out of a hundred newcomers given contracts, only seven became stars, a few others became steady workers and the rest descended into footnotes much smaller than Lyle's. (And that doesn't factor in the multitudes who auditioned and failed.)
Lyle went on to have a Broadway success and a career in television, as well as a crowningly happy family life. But at a certain point in this account, his good fortune becomes too much of a good thing, especially when supplemented by dozens of back stories to which Talbot is irresistibly drawn. Every girlfriend, every gig, receives the full-dress treatment, every domicile an economic and architectural history. We get disquisitions on orphans, freak shows, the treatment of children at the turn of the century, fan clubs, dance marathons, the dangers of early Hollywood, the evolution of movie theaters.
Talbot is generous and scrupulous with attributions, and some of her detours are fascinating (like Lyle's stint working with the low-rent director Ed Wood). But cumulatively they begin to weigh the reader down, excess cargo on a flight that should have been as buoyant as its main character.
Her assessments of movies are sharp and engaging, without being strikingly original. (However, her reappraisal of ''The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet,'' in which Lyle played the good-natured neighbor, is a fine piece of cultural revisionism.) But I can't allow to pass unchallenged her assertion that ''the pre-Code era produced only a few really great talking pictures.'' It's true that the current vogue is for bypassing the classics to unearth scrappy, unsung movies, whose very imperfections testify to an earlier, freewheeling period Hollywood will never see again. Still, ''really great'' is the wrong term if it can't include ''Scarface,'' ''The Public Enemy,'' ''Trouble in Paradise,'' ''Morocco,'' ''Shanghai Express,'' ''What Price Hollywood?,'' ''Dinner at Eight,'' ''Little Women'' and the early films of Busby Berkeley and Mae West.
To Richard Lingeman's disadvantage, there is nothing unsung about film noir, those harsh and lurid little tales reeking of European-style fatalism. The genre has been the subject of a whole range of books, some of them superb, tracing the many tributaries feeding these pools of bile in a cinema that leans too persistently toward the sun. Lingeman's point of entry is through his own years as a veteran, and he understands firsthand the sense of displacement, the frightening and disorienting experience of being thrown into an alien culture (for him, Japan) and then thrust back upon the shores of a homeland that seems almost as alien. But movies, as it turns out, play a relatively small role in a book that's more interested in the always perilous struggle of America's liberals and progressives. Lingeman's discussion of films is never less than interesting, and he understands the paradox of a politically repressive period leading to some of the most inventive films ever made, often with subliminal blacklisting themes.
But the heart of his writerly energy is the New Deal and its aftermath. A whole chapter is devoted -- and devoted seems the right word -- to the quixotic career of Henry Wallace. It's not hard to see where Lingeman's passion lies, though he tells us only indirectly. Even his personal memories are carefully impersonal.
Along with movies, ''The Noir Forties'' contains fine summaries of other arts -- Lingeman is especially good on the exuberant mishmash of populist forms of music that emerged after the war. But without a strong thematic engine to provide a sense of structure, without a protagonist -- be it movies or music or Wallace -- there is simply too much information floating freely. At times I felt I was slogging through an undergraduate textbook, but without the clear timeline and emphases to guide us and tell us what's important. I think I learned a lot about labor and management, and the struggles over wage and price controls, about the F.E.P.C. and the O.P.A. and the O.W.M.R. But please don't give me a test.

HEADLINE: Welcome to Saudi Albany?

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
The people who run U.S. Steel have not had much reason to celebrate in a long time. Once the icon of American manufacturing, the company became shorthand for the country's industrial decline. For decades, it ignored innovation and was undercut by cheaper Asian producers and outflanked by U.S. start-ups. Its brief glory in the mid-2000s turned out to be fueled by housing-bubble excess; and its stock price has dropped nearly 90 percent since late 2008. A few months ago, John P. Surma, the company's chairman and C.E.O., addressed a Steel Hall of Fame event at which all the inductees were either long dead or retired. He noted that, given the business climate, his own generation of steel C.E.O.'s might have trouble getting the big prize themselves. 
Fortunately, Surma went on, this misery is about to change. The American steel industry recently received the economic equivalent of a gift from the heavens: natural gas extracted by means of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Fracking involves a whole lot of long steel pipes being sunk into rock formations thousands of feet beneath the ground in search of hydrocarbons. U.S. Steel, which is based in Pittsburgh, also happens to be right on top of the Marcellus Shale, the oil-rich formation that stretches from New York to Ohio. No one knows exactly how much gas is down there, but modest estimates suggest it's at least 100 trillion cubic feet. Given this bounty, U.S. Steel recently spent $100 million on a facility whose entire purpose is to make ''tubular product'' for gas companies.
For Surma, an even bigger gift should come over the next few decades. The switch from coal to cheaper natural gas will save U.S. Steel hundreds of millions of dollars a year. These savings will be amplified by the fact that the company's competitors in Europe and Asia will need to pay much more. In fact, many economists say that fracking will soon fundamentally shift global economic logic to uniquely benefit the United States. Ed Morse, an influential energy analyst at Citigroup, argues that the natural-gas industry will bring around three million new jobs to the United States by the end of this decade. He also expects that fracking will add up to 3 percent to our G.D.P. and trillions in additional tax revenue. Along the way, it will turn around perennial stragglers, like steel and manufacturing. For millions of workers, there could not be any better news.
Fracking, of course, is not universally embraced. The State of Pennsylvania lists more than 80 chemicals that are injected into the earth as part of the hydraulic-fracturing process. Many are pretty nasty, including formaldehyde, naphthalene and crystalline silica, which are known to cause all sorts of illnesses, including cancer. Fracking's early years, more than a decade ago, were similar to the old wildcatter days in California and Texas. Small companies dug quickly and with little constraint from unprepared regulators.
More recently, this has changed considerably. Earlier this year, Ohio passed new rules requiring higher standards for fracking-well construction. Pennsylvania is expected to update its regulations very soon. West Virginia, a state historically friendly to the hydrocarbon industry, passed rules allowing for more public comment before any new wells are dug. New York, the only significant Marcellus Shale state that is still deciding whether to allow fracking, commissioned a panel of independent experts to determine whether the industry, overseen by strict regulation, can operate without hurting citizens. The review is expected early next year.
Most observers would agree, though, that changes in regulation do not come from objective scientific studies. (Both sides, after all, can flood any government hearing with experts and impressive-looking scientific reports.) Regulations are determined, in large part, by politics. And the politics of fracking are changing and are very likely to change drastically in coming years. As examples from the last century suggest, the sudden discovery of oil and gas can transform an entire economy and regulatory system to serve the industry's interests. Economists call this the resource curse -- the perverse process in which a valuable discovery like oil, gas, diamonds or gold ends up enriching a few at the cost of impoverishing most of the population. At its worst, the resource curse leads to deeply corrupt regimes like those in Iraq, Iran, Myanmar and Libya. At its mildest, this can create one-industry economies in which there is little innovation and even less resistance to the whims of a handful of powerful interests. Many believe this already describes the oil economies of Louisiana, Texas and Oklahoma and, increasingly, North Dakota, where the fracking industry is entrenched. Politically and economically, it's hard to argue with an industry that has helped keep the state's unemployment rate at about 3 percent.
If there is an uneasy equilibrium, right now, between environmentally concerned citizens and pro-fracking industrial groups, what will the political balance be like in a decade? What pressures will be on state legislatures and regulators if the projections are true and the millions of workers in Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia and maybe New York will owe their jobs to fracking. There will be trillions of dollars of new wealth. Will environmental and health concerns have any chance against that juggernaut?
It doesn't necessarily have to end badly. In the late 1960s, Norway's economy was immediately transformed when it discovered massive crude deposits off its North Sea shores. Back then, Farouk al-Kasim, an Iraqi-born Norwegian petroleum engineer, warned that all that sudden easy money could create ''so much pressure that it will completely overwhelm environmental concerns; the force can undermine moral, ethical barriers.'' The money available to the industry and government was so ample, he told me recently, that people soon began to say, ''I don't care, I'm getting rich, to hell with everybody else.''
Norway avoided the curse, and America will, too, Kasim said, because it has a huge, diverse economy. Still, as oil-rich states have shown, it's possible for even a relatively small extractive industry to cause severe damage. In fact, the best thing that any U.S. environmentalist can do is to start thinking like an economist -- particularly a Norwegian one. In 1990, Norway began channeling money from oil and gas into a pension fund designed to keep the country stable when the crude ran out. It's now the largest sovereign wealth fund in the world, as Norway showed that the best defense against an extraction industry was diverse economic growth. For environmentalists, and even steel behemoths, it's a point worth remembering.
Deep thoughts this week:
1. Love it or hate it, fracking will redefine the U.S. economy.
2. Yes, there are serious environmental issues to address.
3. But the worst hazards may be political.
4. And even economic.

HEADLINE: Cat Custody

BYLINE: By CHUCK KLOSTERMAN

 BODY:
A neighbor recently posted on a neighborhood forum that after several years, her lost cat returned home. The cat was a kitten when it went astray. Naturally, the neighbors did the usual things you do when you lose a cat; searched endlessly, put food out and posted on community boards, electronic and otherwise. The family was naturally relieved when the cat returned. However, someone has clearly cared for the cat. It is healthy and has been neutered. But there's no indication of ownership. My neighbor's dilemma is a question of obligation to the ''temporary'' family and whether she can take ownership of the cat. CRAIG FIELD, AUSTIN, TEX. 
Let's start with a pair of practical concerns: First, are you certain this is the same cat? The idea of a prodigal kitty (returning home after ''several years'') strikes me as implausible. Second, if there's no identification on the animal, there isn't a pressing ethical problem. Your neighbor should make a good-faith effort to find the previous caretaker (as she would upon finding any lost pet). But until such a person emerges, the cat is hers. Don't let it outside.
Let's assume, however, that whoever cared for the cat comes forward. How do you decide who deserves ownership over a sentient creature that can't speak for itself? I think it comes down to the accepted purpose of the animal. In general, the original owner of property is its rightful owner, especially when the property helps the owner make a living. If this cat were a Holstein, I'd side with your neighbor, based on the premise that a milk cow is a commodity whose primary worth is economic. In America, we typically see the value of livestock as an impersonal reflection of its value on the open market (obviously, not everyone views cattle this way, but this perspective is accepted and reasonable). Cats and other household pets are considered far differently. A cat is not a commodity; a cat is a little furry friend. And who has sustained a friendship with the cat? The people who kept it alive, fed it for several years and took it to the vet. I would award the cat to those who took the most care of it.
Now, I realize my reasoning creates some irrefutable contradictions: You can love a cow as much as you love a cat; certain kitties have noteworthy financial value; each animal is equally alive. I'm not arguing that cats are better than cows. I'm arguing that -- from a human perspective -- they interlope in our lives in very different ways. A cat is still technically a possession, but a possession whose purpose is companionship. As such, the rightful owner is he who served as its longtime companion.
I suppose there's always the classic option of threatening to cut the cat in half in order to see which party intercedes, but I would suggest against this. From the perspective of the cat, that's a ''high risk, low reward'' scenario.

HEADLINE: A Soap Opera on the High Seas

BYLINE: By CHARLES HOMANS

 BODY:
A lesser-known consequence of the collapse of the real estate market in 2007 was the sudden unemployment of a 40-year-old carpenter from Kalamazoo, Mich., named Scott Meisterheim. Meisterheim first went to Las Vegas, then north to an oil-drilling camp in the Alaskan Arctic, and, one divorce later, to Nome, Alaska, a town of about 3,500 people huddled on the coast of the Bering Sea, in search of that last hope among last hopes: gold.
People like Scott Meisterheim have been coming to Nome since 1898, when three Scandinavian-American prospectors stumbled upon gold deposits of almost-unthinkable richness in the Anvil Creek watershed outside town. (The largest nugget found there weighed a dozen pounds.) Modern Nome may be a century removed from its glory days, but you can still catch their echo in the town's small harbor, where the docks are lined with gold dredges: rickety pontoon boats that ply the Bering coast, sucking up from the sea floor what's left of Nome's mineral inheritance. 
There are easier ways to make a living. Divers in heated wetsuits must descend into the frigid water for hours at a time, directing vacuum hoses connected to a sorting apparatus aboard the dredge. If you're lucky, you can make thousands of dollars in a week. Meisterheim was not lucky. His first season in Nome was plagued by technical mishaps and shouting matches with his dredging crew. He returned to Michigan well short of the child-support payments he owed, and he spent four nights in jail.
Several months later, in a moodily lighted historic tavern outside Santa Barbara, Calif., Meisterheim was reflecting on the experience in front of a film crew. Seated across the table from him was Vern Adkison, a mountainous Alabama native who owned the dredge that Meisterheim captained. Adkison was convinced that Meisterheim had found more gold than he had let on. ''He lied, he cheated, he maliciously damaged my equipment,'' Adkison growled.
''You wanna go, Vern?'' Meisterheim shouted.
''You're damn right I do!'' Adkison shot back.
Both men jumped up from the table and headed for each other. Meisterheim lunged at Adkison with a pint glass, then began pummeling him with his fist.
''Whoa, dudes!'' Thom Beers, the man sitting between them, shouted as he leapt to his feet. ''Whoa, whoa, whoa!'' Beers, who is 61, was shorter than both Meisterheim and Adkison, and -- with his graying goatee, square-rimmed glasses and beach-bum demeanor -- a bit softer-looking too. Beers is the executive producer of ''Bering Sea Gold,'' a reality show on the Discovery Channel that follows half a dozen Nome dredging crews, including the one led by Meisterheim. The meeting in the tavern was being filmed for the reunion episode capping the show's first season.
Beers tried to get a hold on Adkison as he and Meisterheim caromed off an antique cash register. Finally, Meisterheim stormed out, and Adkison collapsed into his seat, wheezing heavily. Beers turned to one of the video cameras, his stern expression compromised by the hint of a smile. ''We'll be right back,'' he said.
When ''Bering Sea Gold'' made its debut last January, it had the highest ratings of any series premiere in Discovery's history, and a spinoff mini-series, ''Bering Sea Gold: Under the Ice,'' was broadcast this summer. The Meisterheim fight made the gossip site TMZ. Beers brought it up almost immediately when I met him six months later, pointing out with some satisfaction a detail that was easy to miss on TV. ''I'm thinking, I should man up and do something,'' he recalled. ''So I step in to break up the fight, and I catch one, boom, right on the jaw. And I'm like, All right, this is television!''
If you have spent any time in the past decade clicking through certain neighborhoods of cable TV -- former educational channels like Discovery and History, caterers to prolonged male adolescence like Spike and truTV -- you have seen Thom Beers's work. It's the reason that viewers who have never worked a day away from an Aeron chair may know the dimensions and weight of a crab pot or the freezing point of synthetic transmission fluid. It's the reason that on any given night you might turn on the television to find a fisherman or bush pilot detailing the hazards of his job to Jay Leno. Beers, who currently has 13 shows on 8 networks, is one of the few producers in reality television who is synonymous with an entire subgenre. What Andy Cohen is to over-the-top socialites and Mark Burnett is to game shows on South Pacific islands, Beers is to blue-collar TV.
There are the hits: Discovery's ''Deadliest Catch'' (about crab fishermen in the Bering Sea), History's ''Ice Road Truckers'' (about truck drivers in the Canadian Arctic) and ''Ax Men'' (about loggers), all of them among the top-rated programs in their networks' histories. ''Motorcycle Mania,'' a special that Beers produced for Discovery in 2000, introduced the world to the bike builder Jesse James, proprietor of the now-multimillion-dollar West Coast Choppers brand and then-future-ex of Sandra Bullock. ''Storage Wars'' -- which adapts the high-octane, competition-oriented format of Beers's earlier hits to the less-rugged world of delinquent-storage-unit auctions -- became A&E's highest rated series ever last year.
Then there are the knockoffs of the hits -- a half-dozen ''Deadliest Catch'' spinoffs and similar shows, like ''Lobster Wars'' and ''Swords'' -- and the one- or two-season oddities, like ''Verminators,'' about exterminators in California. Beers's work ''has a very strong point of view,'' says Cecile Frot-Coutaz, the C.E.O. of FremantleMedia, one of the largest reality-TV production companies in the world, ''which is why he's been so successful.'' In 2009, Fremantle, a British subsidiary of the German media colossus Bertelsmann, reportedly paid $50 million for a controlling stake in Beers's company, Original Productions. In August, Fremantle named Beers C.E.O. of its North American division, which produces ''American Idol,'' ''The X Factor'' and ''America's Got Talent.'' Several weeks before the deal was announced, I watched Beers hold court in a roadhouse on the outskirts of Nome, placing $400 in 20s on the bar and ordering shots of Crown Royal for anyone in earshot. Now, this same guy was, in a roundabout way, Britney Spears's boss.
This is actually less strange than it seems. Beers's particular genius is realizing that the sphere of aspirational television could be enlarged beyond the mainstays of wealth, talent, youth and celebrity. That Americans wanted to step into not only the lives they might never live but also the lives they walked away from generations ago. ''The stories we're telling are guys' versions of romance novels,'' says Nancy Dubuc, the president of A&E Networks, who commissioned ''Ice Road Truckers.'' ''People think about leaving the confines of the cubicle, or wherever they may be, and see the same traits that their grandfathers and great-grandfathers had growing up. It's very nostalgic.''
The son of a Ford regional service manager and a local actress in upstate New York, Beers grew up in an environment in which the garage and the distant mirage of Hollywood were both plausible ambitions. (As a boy, his most loathed chore was walking a pink-dyed poodle that Jayne Mansfield, a family friend, had given his mother.) He attended four colleges and graduated from none of them before moving to Manhattan to study acting with Lee Strasberg. After spending his 20s and early 30s struggling as an actor and a playwright, he dabbled in television-commercial production. This led to a series of jobs at Turner Broadcasting, culminating in a stint as an executive at the company's series and specials unit.
In 1998, a Discovery Channel executive named Steve Burns approached Beers -- at the time barely a year into a new career as an independent producer -- about making a one-hour special called ''Extreme Alaska.'' It was supposed to include a 15-minute segment about Alaskan crab fishing, at the time the deadliest occupation in the United States. That January, Beers and two cameramen set out from the Aleutian Island port of Dutch Harbor, where the Bering Sea crab-fishing fleet delivers its catch. The plan was to spend a couple of days out of port on a crab boat called Fierce Allegiance, get the footage and go home.
Instead, Beers and his crew found themselves stuck at sea for a week as the boat battled an uncommonly ferocious storm. Waves swelled to the height of a four-story building. Beers pitched in with the work on deck, only to fall victim to the fisherman's ailment known as ''the claw,'' the muscles and joints in his hands knotting up hopelessly. Still, he was aware of the elemental intensity of the footage: the crew lurching back and forth on the slick wood and steel in their orange and yellow rain gear, the prehistoric strangeness of the snow crabs, the terrifying void of the heaving sea. When he got back to California, he called Burns. ''Listen,'' he said. ''There's something big here.''
Five years later, after the success of ''Monster Garage,'' Beers's first series for Discovery, the network agreed to send him back to the Bering Sea with a larger crew to film a three-part mini-series called ''Deadliest Season.'' The network broadcast all three episodes in sequence on a Sunday night, with little promotional fanfare. The following morning, Billy Campbell, the head of the network at the time, called Beers to congratulate him. From the beginning of the first episode to the end of the third, the show's viewership had nearly quintupled, to 3.8 million. ''When can we have another one?'' Campbell wanted to know. ''Deadliest Catch'' made its debut the following year. By the end of the season it was the highest-rated summer series on Discovery.
''Deadliest Catch'' arrived at the auspicious moment when ad-supported cable was transforming from a sleepy province of reruns and one-offs to a launching ground for original shows. In 2003, sports broadcasts constituted nearly half of all original ad-supported cable programming. By 2008 -- the same year that cable advertising revenues first surpassed broadcast advertising revenues -- the overall number of original programs had nearly tripled. Documentary-style shows -- created by small outside production firms with limited overhead, free of unionized screenwriters and expensive talent -- accounted for 30 percent of all original programming.
Crab fishing, it turned out, also bore an uncanny natural resemblance to the kind of competition a reality producer might devise. Bering Sea fishermen worked for days on end without respite to catch as many crabs as possible. It was a race against the clock with quantifiable winners and losers, and the fishermen -- permanently sleep-deprived, battered by the elements -- were edgy and prone to conflict. And as the ''Deadliest Catch'' narrator relentlessly reminded the audience, the stakes, quite literally, could be life and death.
By its third season, ''Deadliest Catch'' had crossed over from cult hit to cultural touchstone. In early 2007, when I happened to be living in Dutch Harbor, I met Sig Hansen, one of the most popular characters on the show. Aside from the ubiquitous cameras, Hansen's life in Alaska did not seem appreciably different from what it had always been. But when he was recently in Las Vegas on vacation, he told me with evident bewilderment, Mötley Crüe's singer, Vince Neil, approached him to say what a huge fan he was. A woman at a casino tried to tear off his shirt.
Beers, meanwhile, was trying to extract a formula from ''Deadliest Catch,'' settling on a few rudiments that have since become staples of his work. There had to be a ticking clock; there had to be teams in competition with one another; and there had to be a primal, omnipresent external threat. The threat wasn't always easy to come by. When History first approached Beers about making a show about truck drivers in the Canadian Arctic, he was nonplused. The trucks drove in a straight line on roads groomed across the surface of frozen lakes, at 25 miles an hour. Then it hit him: the ice. His crew descended beneath the frozen surface in diving gear and filmed the trucks rolling overhead, recorded the sounds of the ice cracking and bending under the weight and juxtaposed it with claustrophobic night-vision footage filmed inside the cabs. ''Ice Road Truckers'' became for a while the highest-rated show on History.
Beers's shows did not necessarily render an unvarnished view of the workers' lives, or place them in any larger context. (Beers has been criticized -- particularly with regard to ''Coal,'' his show about underground mining -- for making apolitical shows about decidedly political occupations.) Instead, they made hard work conform to the expectations of a drama. ''All of my stuff,'' Beers told me, ''is based on the three-act structure, as if I was writing a play.'' It is now virtually impossible to surf the cable spectrum without landing on a series built on the Beers template: shows about bush pilots, swamp loggers, wild-pig hunters, gold miners, snake wranglers, repo men, tugboat operators, animal-control officers. Blue-collar TV shows have tested the bounds of interest (A&E's ''Parking Wars,'' a show about parking-enforcement cops that is, bafflingly, in its sixth season) and plausibility (Discovery's ''Moonshiners,'' which local officials in Virginia have accused of being an elaborate hoax). ''He cornered the market,'' says Abby Greensfelder, a former Discovery executive who runs the reality-TV production company Half Yard Productions. ''Now a lot of people have imitated that, but he was the pioneer. He really defined a genre.''
In July, Beers and I flew to Nome to watch his production team as they filmed the second season of ''Bering Sea Gold.'' One of the first people I saw when I walked off the plane happened to be one of Beers's stars, a 34-year-old gold dredger named Ian Foster. Later that evening, I rode out with Foster in his battered Ford F-250 to West Beach, a century-old prospectors' camp just outside Nome proper, where he lives during the dredging season. Foster's cabin, like the others on the beach, had no heat or water; his life was as unalloyed a Jack London fantasy as was conceivable in the 21st century. So it was a little jarring when he started talking about his agent and the stalled contract negotiations with Discovery that had, so far, kept him out of Season 2 of ''Bering Sea Gold.'' ''What we're looking for now,'' Foster told me, ''is a combination of money and rights. If the money's great, potentially we could give up some rights. But it's kind of a balance.''
Beers's stars' awareness of their own celebrity has begun to follow a predictable arc. ''Season 1, they're just amazed that they're on TV,'' Beers told me. ''Season 2, they're amazed they're still on TV, but they start resenting that they're not getting paid more. Season 3, you start getting strikes. Season 4, they're usually still groaning and moaning. Then Season 5, if you get that far, you're good.''
This had something to do with a subtle but significant change that crept into Beers's programs around the third season of ''Deadliest Catch'': The shows had become less about the characters' jobs and more about the characters themselves. ''He turned crab fishing into one of the best soap operas ever,'' W. Clark Bunting, the former president of Discovery, says. If this gave Beers's shows more longevity, it also gave his stars more leverage. As Jeff B. Cohen, a Hollywood entertainment lawyer who represented two ''Deadliest Catch'' fishermen in a lawsuit over compensation two years ago, put it to me, ''You can't have 'The Kardashians' without the Kardashians.''
Beers's subjects are paid considerably less than, say, Snooki -- who made a reported $2.5 million for the final season of ''Jersey Shore'' -- and are conspicuously absent from the lucrative endorsement deals that are now de rigueur elsewhere in reality TV. (A crab fisherman who does not actually have to fish for crab does not make for good TV.) What exactly they deserve to be paid, however, remains a slippery question. When ''Storage Wars'' climbed to the top of A&E's ratings in 2010, the show's stars -- a handful of public-auction bidders in Southern California -- ''wanted Snooki money,'' Beers told me. ''The first season, the guys were driving these beat-up old pickups,'' he said. ''Second season, they're driving Maseratis.'' In an effort to keep the cast in check, he started spinoffs in Texas and New York. ''I never get this from the 'Storage Wars: Texas' guys,'' he said. ''But everyone in California -- they're seeing their faces on billboards.''
After the initial success of ''Bering Sea Gold,'' Discovery moved quickly to lock its stars into five-year contracts and avoid a ''Storage Wars''-style drama. Among the most valuable was Meisterheim, who had emerged as the show's signature antihero. ''I told Scott, 'You're like the Heath Ledger of reality TV, man,' '' says Russ Herriott, a Las Vegas-based talent agent who represents nearly all of the cast members of ''Bering Sea Gold.'' '' 'You are the Joker.' ''
When I met Meisterheim in Nome, he wouldn't say how much he was making under his deal, allowing only that ''it ain't never enough. I did some comparisons with people who are on other reality-TV shows, people who have the same status I do, and they make way more.'' But he had child-support payments to make, he told me, so he signed anyway. ''What bothers me is the way they disrespect me now that I'm under contract. They like to belittle you and threaten not to pay you what they owe you because you're not giving them what they want. The cameras are a pain. . . . They know how to provoke situations.''
Beers's producers had their own concerns about the arrangement, which had come up in a meeting the previous morning at Original's Nome office. ''Is there any way that we could try to humanize Scott Meisterheim?'' John Gray, a producer calling in on the speakerphone, asked the team. ''Make him not look as much like a tyrant? This is kind of coming down from the network.''
''John, what does the network want?'' Beers asked.
''Their fear is, basically, that he's going to come across as totally unlikable,'' Gray said. ''Which he does. At least last year he had the child-support thing going on.''
As it happened, this was a worry that Meisterheim himself shared. ''Once you've already been the villain one time,'' he told me, ''then you gotta outdo yourself the next year. You can only be so big of an ass, you know, before it just gets to be stupid.'' Still, Meisterheim knew that for the moment, villainy was his brand. After the first season of ''Bering Sea Gold'' was shown, he found investors to finance the construction of his own dredge, which he christened Anchor Management. The name was a play on two accusations: that he had anger issues, and that he didn't know how to properly set a ship's anchor. Before bringing Anchor Management to Nome, Meisterheim applied to trademark the name. He also applied to trademark his own.
Beers sometimes jokes that his work resembles the natural-resource-extraction industries that he makes shows about, and after a few days following his production crew around Nome, I started to feel as if I were walking through the reality-TV equivalent of a clear-cut forest. In Alaska today, it's difficult to find a profession that hasn't been turned into a TV show; on his flight up from Los Angeles, Beers shared a plane with two reality-TV production teams.
It's hard to miss the paradox in this. Half a century ago, the notion that most Americans would soon be at least a generation removed from skilled manual labor would have seemed remarkable. But now that that's where we are, our relative comfort gnaws at us. The frequency that we respond to in Beers's work is the same one that makes suburban accountants buy Ford Super Duty pickups and Brooklyn graphic designers grow fake lumberjack beards. And yet this very desire for authenticity has turned some of the last truly unreconstructed frontiersmen in America into that least authentic of creatures: the minor celebrity.
Then again, one of the great surprises in the past several years of reality programming is the extent to which viewers are willing to watch people do almost any job on TV, exotically difficult or not. Beginning with ''Storage Wars,'' Beers has begun adapting his formula to this shifting frontier; he has several new ''Deadliest Catch''-style programs in the works, but the shows he now seems most excited about were about more mundane professions. He had developed a show about antiques hunters called ''America's Lost Treasures,'' which made its debut on the National Geographic Channel this summer, and he was hoping to pitch a series about three rival cheese-steak restaurants. He recently tried to sell a show about competitive clog dancers. ''They hate each other,'' he said. ''They're constantly trying to steal each others' talent. And it's awesome.''

HEADLINE: The Credit Union Alternative

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
THIS year for the first time in their century-old history, credit unions are on track to surpass $100 billion in mortgage loan originations.
Member-owned and not-for-profit, the institutions have benefited from the explosion in home refinancing, as well as a record growth in membership that industry representatives attribute to consumer disillusionment with the big banks.
''We'd be remiss if we didn't give a shout-out to the major banks for being annoying to consumers and forcing people to seek out other alternatives,'' said Bob Dorsa, the president of the American Credit Union Mortgage Association in Las Vegas. 
Mr. Dorsa says much of the growth in mortgage business is concentrated among giant credit unions like Navy Federal and Pentagon Federal, which together have more than five million members. But he also says the industry as a whole has tried to reach out to younger generations who may overlook credit unions or consider them outdated.
Some institutions have even dropped ''credit union'' from their names because they believe it sounds antiquated, he said.
Credit unions were originally formed to provide affordable credit to defined groups of underserved customers, like those working for the same employer. Over the years restrictions on membership have loosened; the only requirement these days may be that the member and the credit union reside in the same community.
The CUC Mortgage Corporation originates and services mortgages for about 220 small to medium-sized credit unions, mostly in New York. Ed Kovalefsky, the company's chief operating officer, says CUC has seen a 45 percent increase in first mortgage originations this year compared with last year. ''I think our credit unions are aggressively going after the business,'' he said. ''They try to be as competitive as possible with regard to rates.''
At the end of the third quarter, the credit union share of mortgage originations totaled about $89 billion nationwide, $7 billion more than in all of 2011, according to data provided by Mr. Dorsa.
This is not to suggest that credit unions are giving money away. Because they are owned by their members, the institutions tend to be fairly averse to risk.
And that has lately worked to their advantage. As portfolio lenders, credit unions usually keep at least half of new loans in their own investment portfolios, according to Bill Hampel, the chief economist for the Credit Union National Association. This allowed them to continue lending and build market share as the secondary market for mortgage loans collapsed during the housing crisis.
Borrowers shopping for a mortgage might find that credit unions can offer slightly lower closing costs than banks. Another advantage is that most credit unions retain the servicing on all of their mortgage loans (or contract with companies like CUC to do it for them). As member-owned cooperatives, they have an incentive to be responsive to their customers, Mr. Hampel said.
''The people working at credit unions know that they'll keep their jobs if they keep their members happy,'' he said. ''There are no divided loyalties.''
Still, borrowers should scrutinize a credit union's offer as they would any offer from any bank, broker or lender, advised John Walsh, the president of Total Mortgage Services in Milford, Conn. ''Some credit unions could potentially have an expanded product line,'' he said, ''but a fair amount of the smaller ones have a fairly narrow product line.''
Writing mortgages helps credit unions establish a lasting relationship with consumers, Mr. Dorsa noted. But he is concerned that credit unions may not be able to hold onto so much business as interest rates creep up.
''Historically, when rates go up and refi goes down, our share and origination volume drops,'' he said. ''We've made a concerted effort this time to get out in front of Realtors, so we hope we won't take as much of a hit productionwise as we have in the past.''

HEADLINE: When Is a Neighborhood a Sandwich?

BYLINE: By ALISON GREGOR

 BODY:
MAPLETON is on New York City's street closures map. You'll also find houses in Mapleton on real estate sites like Trulia and Streeteasy. There's a Mapleton branch of the public library and a Mapleton public school, along with a bowling alley and a Kiwanis Club. But just where the heck is Mapleton, Brooklyn?
If the borough's history is one of neighborhoods buffeting one another with each new wave of immigration, Mapleton, which is at least a century old, appears to have gotten the squeeze. Years ago, Italians claimed the southern portion for Bensonhurst, while Hasidic and Orthodox Jewish families have pushed the borders of Borough Park to include the northern section.
And most recently, Chinese immigrants overflowing from Sunset Park and other areas are settling in the southwestern portion. 
''I'm a Kiwanian, and we actually have a Mapleton club,'' said Michael E. Napolitano, an associate broker with Re/Max Metro who lives nearby in the Bath Beach section of Bensonhurst. ''But they don't even meet in Mapleton. I guess the name is pretty old, and over the years the name has been diluted and nobody really uses it anymore.''
Even if that's so, Mapleton is a community apart from the two rather homogenous ones sandwiching it, said David G. Greenfield, who is a resident.
''Mapleton is sort of like the melting pot in the middle,'' added Mr. Greenfield, a city councilman. ''On a typical block, you'll probably find several Hasidic families, several Italian-American families and several Asian-American families. They all get along very well.''
So what makes up Mapleton today? The Web site for the Mapleton School indicates that Mapleton constitutes the approximately 60 blocks that stretch from 16th Avenue on the west to Dahill Road on the east, and from 57th Street on the north to 65th Street on the south. On the Internet, sites like Google Maps show Mapleton as a triangle generally in that same area, except its peak stretches up to the intersection of 18th and McDonald Avenues. According to 2010 census data, Mapleton has about 27,000 people.
Some people see the northern boundary of Washington Cemetery, a predominantly Jewish cemetery that is one of the largest in Brooklyn, as the northern limit of Mapleton. And because of the Mapleton School and the Mapleton branch of the Brooklyn Public Library, which are both in the 60th Street area, the name rings bells with many locals who otherwise would not describe themselves as living there.
Often called Borough Park north of 60th Street and Bensonhurst south of 60th, the area is almost completely residential, with small retail shops and restaurants on some avenues, particularly in the Bensonhurst portion.
There have been setbacks since the 2008 housing crash. One Hasidic resident, who asked not to be identified, said that he had bought his three-bedroom two-bath home six years ago for $725,000 -- and that its value had depreciated at least 35 percent.
But with everything he needs around him, the resident said, he probably wouldn't have moved anyway. ''It's a community,'' he said. ''Everything you need for an Orthodox Jewish life is in the neighborhood. The schools for the boys, for the girls. The stores, kosher restaurants, everything. My parents, my wife's parents, my brothers, my sisters, my uncles -- I see them every day.''
WHAT YOU'LL FIND
When Mapleton was developed as Mapleton Park, beginning around 1910, homes were built of brick with large porches on 30-by-100-foot lots cut out of farmland. The area was one of the ''choicest home communities'' in that part of Brooklyn, according to an article in The New York Times from 1914.
Nowadays, Mapleton consists primarily of one- and two-family attached and semiattached homes of brick or clapboard, many about a century old. A substantial number still have small porches or stoops, or even a bit of lawn. On Mapleton's fringes are some small four- and six-family apartment buildings, Mr. Napolitano said.
Eighteenth Avenue between 57th and 65th Streets is full of small shops, an increasing number of them serving the Asian residents moving in. One of the oldest businesses, 62-year-old J & V Pizzeria, belongs to Italian immigrants -- a reflection of a bygone era. The owner, Vito Conigliaro, originally from the Sicilian city of Palermo, speaks English and Spanish to get by, in addition to his native Italian, though he doesn't know Mandarin or Cantonese.
''There's a lot of Hispanic people here,'' he said, kneading thick ropes of dough. ''When you work with Hispanic people you learn the language. Now, 45 percent of the area is owned by Asians.''
Mr. Conigliaro's pizzeria is surrounded by Asian grocers, bakeries and restaurants, though there's still an Italian pork store across the street. Two blocks east, on 20th Avenue, the mix of businesses is even more diverse, reflecting Mapleton as a melting pot, with signs in Arabic, Spanish, Chinese, Russian, Hebrew, Korean and English.
''Today,'' declares the Public School 48 The Mapleton School site, ''our population is a mixture of Italian, Jewish, Asian, Pakistan, Polish, Latino and Arab families.''
North of 60th Street, the neighborhood tends to be quieter, encompassing Washington Cemetery and the 6.4-acre Gravesend Park; there are fewer businesses, and most have signs in Hebrew. There are glatt kosher restaurants, kosher wine shops, a big kosher supermarket called Goldberg's Grocery Glatt Meat, and even kosher pizzerias.
WHAT YOU'LL PAY
Home prices fell about 10 percent in the recession, but the neighborhood has remained healthy with the large numbers of Chinese immigrants moving into its southern portion, as well as the rapidly growing population of Hasidic residents to the north.
''I know it's a pretty hot neighborhood right now, and a lot of people are coming in and buying,'' said Joseph Giordano, an agent with Coldwell Banker Reliable.
On Trulia.com there are 99 sale listings in Mapleton; Brooklyn's Multiple Listing Service doesn't have a separate category for the area.
The average sale price for a two-family home is about $660,000; a single-family home would sell for about $600,000, Mr. Giordano said. According to Mr. Napolitano, small four-family buildings are selling around $1 million.
Mike Daus, an agent with Charles Rutenberg, says that studios rent for $700 to $900 a month, one-bedrooms for $1,000 to $1,200, and two-bedrooms for up to $1,600.
THE COMMUTE
Residents like the easy commute to Manhattan. ''It's convenient to the subways, and there's lots of transportation,'' said Sister Elizabeth Schroeder, who has lived in the neighborhood at the St. Athanasius Convent for 17 years.
The N and the F subways make several stops here, making Midtown Manhattan and even parts of Queens accessible along with Coney Island. The ride into Midtown typically takes 45 to 55 minutes. There are several local bus lines, including the B9, B6, B8 and B11.
WHAT TO DO
From 1916 to at least 1920, Mapleton had a baseball field at 62nd Street and 20th Avenue, called Mapleton Oval or simply Mapleton Park. There are no signs of it today. Athletic activity has shifted northwest to Gravesend Park, which has a playground, ball fields and basketball courts, and offerings like bocce and tennis.
By the end of 2013, the playground will be greatly expanded, said Wolf Sender, the district manager of Community Board 12, which encompasses the northern part of Mapleton. About $15 million has been earmarked for the park, which is on 18th Avenue between 56th and 58th Streets.
''The area now has got a lot of children, the Mapleton area,'' Mr. Sender said. ''There's a lot of large families. Hasidic families on the average are 5 to 10 children.''
The Mapleton library branch, at 60th Street and 17th Avenue, is a popular outpost of the library system. Mapleton also has as its namesake the bowling alley Maple Lanes, on 60th Street near 16th Avenue -- but not for long. The bowling alley is to be demolished to make way for more three-family homes, Councilman Greenfield said.
THE SCHOOLS
While some Catholic boys in Brooklyn travel long distances to go to Xaverian High School in Bay Ridge, some Catholic girls do the same to go to Bishop Kearney High School at 60th Street and Bay Parkway in Mapleton, Mr. Napolitano said.
Among the public primary options, the Mapleton School serves about 620 students from prekindergarten through fifth grade. It got a B on its most recent city progress report, with 60 percent of tested students showing mastery in English, 79.5 in math, versus 47 and 60 citywide. A public secondary option is the Franklin Delano Roosevelt High School at 20th Avenue near 59th Street, where SAT averages in 2011 were 382 in reading, 485 in math and 382 in writing, versus 436, 460 and 431 citywide.
THE HISTORY
Mapleton, Borough Park and Bensonhurst, along with Bay Ridge, Fort Hamilton and Dyker Heights, all used to be part of a Dutch village known as New Utrecht, said Ron Schweiger, the Brooklyn borough historian.

HEADLINE: Under Many Aliases, Mislabeled Foods Find Their Way to Dinner Tables

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
ATLANTA -- The menu offered fried catfish. But Freddie Washington, a pastor in Tuscaloosa, Ala., who sometimes eats out five nights a week and was raised on Gulf Coast seafood, was served tilapia.
It was a culinary bait and switch. Mr. Washington complained. The restaurant had run out of catfish, the manager explained, and the pastor left the restaurant with a free dinner, an apology and a couple of gift certificates.
''If I'm paying for a menu item,'' Mr. Washington said, ''I'm expecting that menu item to be placed before me.''
The subject of deceptive restaurant menus took on new life last week when Oceana, an international organization dedicated to ocean conservation, released a report with the headline ''Widespread Seafood Fraud Found in New York City.'' 
Using genetic testing, the group found tilapia and tilefish posing as red snapper. Farmed salmon was sold as wild. Escolar, which can also legally be called oil fish, was disguised as white tuna, which is an unofficial nickname for albacore tuna.
Every one of 16 sushi bars investigated sold the researchers mislabeled fish. In all, 39 percent of the seafood from 81 grocery stores and restaurants was not what the establishment claimed it was.
''This thing with fish is age old, it's been going on forever,'' said Anne Quatrano, an Atlanta chef who opened Bacchanalia 20 years ago and kick-started the city's sustainable food movement. ''Unless you buy whole fish, you can't always know what you're getting from a supplier.''
Swapping one ingredient for a less expensive one extends beyond fish and is not always the fault of the person who sells food to the restaurant. Many a pork cutlet has headed to a table disguised as veal, and many an organic salad is not.
The term organic is regulated by the Department of Agriculture, but many other identifying words on a menu are essentially marketing terms. Unscrupulous chefs can falsely claim that a steak is Kobe beef or say a chicken was humanely treated without penalty.
In cases of blatant mislabeling, a chef or supplier often takes the bet that a local or federal agency charged with stopping deceptive practices is not likely to walk in the door. ''This has been going on for as long as I've been cooking,'' said Tom Colicchio, a New York chef and television personality. ''When you start really getting into this stuff, there's so many things people mislabel.''
At Mr. Colicchio's New York restaurants, all but about 5 percent of the meat he serves is from animals raised without antibiotics, he said. It costs him about 30 percent more, so he charges more. ''Yet I have a restaurant down the street that says they have organic chicken when they don't, and they charge less money for it,'' he said. ''It's all part of mislabeling and duping the public.''
Consumers are misled most frequently when they buy fish, investigators say, because there are so many fish in the sea and such limited knowledge among diners. The Food and Drug Administration lists 519 acceptable market names for fish, but more than 1,700 species are sold, said Morgan Liscinsky, a spokesman with the agency.
Marketing thousands of species in the ocean to a dining public who often has to be coaxed to move beyond the top five -- shrimp, tuna, salmon, pollock and tilapia -- is not an exact science.
The line between marketing something like Patagonian toothfish as Chilean sea bass or serving langostino and calling it lobster is a fine one.
Robert DeMasco, who owns Pierless Fish, a wholesaler in New York, used a profanity to describe someone who buys farm-raised fish and sells it as wild. ''But on some of this, they're splitting hairs,'' he said.
In 2005, a customer sued Rubio's, a West Coast taco chain, for misleading the public by selling a langostino lobster burrito. The FDA ruled that practice acceptable, which allowed chains like Long John Silver's and Red Lobster to sell the crustacean called langostino and legally attach the word lobster to it. Maine lobstermen and lawmakers fought the decision unsuccessfully.
During the Florida grouper scandal of 2006, the state attorney general's economic crimes division prosecuted 17 restaurants in the Tampa area and a large food-service company for selling Cambodian ponga instead of the more expensive Florida grouper.
The investigation came after The St. Petersburg Times tested fish and found, for example, that a $23 order of grouper was actually a much cheaper piece of tilapia.
The Boston Globe conducted a similar investigation last year and discovered that Massachusetts consumers routinely paid for more expensive fish and got cheaper substitutes.
In some cases, as many as three-quarters of the samples tested were different fish than what the stores or restaurants said they were. Although state and federal lawmakers said they would improve oversight, a follow-up investigation published this month found that the problem was still widespread.
The battle often plays out on an international scale, where millions of dollars in tax revenue are at play.
For more than a decade, American catfish farmers and federal officials have been fighting Asian imports that are passed on as American catfish or even sole or flounder, but are often something called pangasius.
But enforcement rarely filters down to individual restaurants. The F.D.A. only this year began testing genetic sequencing equipment in an effort to target wholesalers. And while the Federal Trade Commission takes on false advertising claims as it relates to food, the focus is usually on health claims.
Policing a restaurant or a grocery store for mislabeling food most often falls to a state attorney general or a consumer agency, whose offices do not always have the time or resources to track down whether a chicken is really organic or whether that piece of snapper is really tilefish.
Subsequently, both chefs and consumers need to educate themselves and ask more questions, said Karen Karp, a food industry consultant.
''There are many chefs unintentionally propagating this phenomena,'' she said. ''They need to learn more.''
So do diners. If a restaurant claims to have fresh Maine diver scallops in July, it helps to know that the tightly regulated bivalves can be harvested only from December to March. (And that they are rarely taken from the sea by actual divers.) Fresh wild Alaska salmon is rarely on plates in January.
And, chefs and others in the food industry say, diners need to push their willingness to try fish species beyond the familiar. That can be a hard sell in a culture that is eating out and buying cookbooks at a record pace but that also loves a dollar menu.
''People want cheap sushi, and this is what happens,'' said Mr. DeMasco, the New York wholesaler. ''You pay for what you get. That's what I think gets lost in translation.''
Still, most people do not want to arrive at a restaurant armed with an advanced degree and the phone numbers to regulatory agencies. ''Unfortunately, what something like this does is turn people off to eating out,'' Mr. Colicchio said. ''People stop going to restaurants because they think they are getting ripped off.''

HEADLINE: How to Attack the Pay Gap? Speak Up

BYLINE: By JESSICA BENNETT. 
Jessica Bennett is the executive editor of Tumblr.

 BODY:
ANNIE HOULE, grandmother of seven, holds up a stack of pink dollar bills.
''How many of you know about the wage gap?'' she asks a roomful of undergraduates, almost all of them women, at the College of Mount St. Vincent in the Bronx.
A few hands go up.
''Now, how many of you worry about being able to afford New York City when you graduate?''
The room laughs. That's a given. 
Ms. Houle is the national director of a group called the WAGE Project, which aims to close the gender pay gap. She explains that her dollar bills represent the amounts that women will make relative to men, on average, once they enter the work force.
Line them up next to a real dollar, and the difference is stark: 77 cents for white women; 69 cents for black women. The final dollar -- so small that it can fit in a coin purse, represents 57 cents, for Latina women. On a campus that is two-thirds women, many have heard these numbers before. Yet holding them up next to one another is sobering.
''I'm posting this to Facebook,'' one woman says.
One of three male students in the room is heading to the photocopier to make copies for his mother.
Another woman in the group sees a triple threat. ''This is crazy,'' Dominique Remy, a senior studying communications, says, holding the pink cutouts in her hand. ''What if I'm all of them? My mother is Latina. My father is Haitian. I'm a woman.''
I've come to this workshop amazed that it exists -- and wishing that there had been a version of it when I was in school.
I grew up in the Girl Power moment of the 1980s, outpacing my male peers in school and taking on extracurricular activities by the dozen. I soared through high school and was accepted to the college of my choice. And yet, when I landed in the workplace, it seemed that I'd had a particularly rosy view.
When I was hired as a reporter at Newsweek, I took the first salary number that was offered; I felt lucky to be getting a job at all.
But a few years in, by virtue of much office whispering and a few pointed questions, I realized that the men around me were making more than I was, and more than many of my female colleagues. Despite a landmark sex discrimination lawsuit filed against the magazine in 1970, which paved the way for women there and at other publications to become writers, we still had a long way to go, it turned out.
When I tried to figure out why my salary was comparatively lower, it occurred to me: couldn't I have simply asked for more? The problem was that I was terrified at the prospect. When I finally mustered up the nerve, I made my pitch clumsily, my voice shaking and my face beet red. I brought along a printed list of my accomplishments, yet I couldn't help but feel boastful saying them out loud. While waiting to hear whether I would get the raise (I did), I agonized over whether I should have asked at all.
This fear of asking is a problem for many women: we are great advocates for others, but paralyzed when it comes to doing it for ourselves.
BACK at the Bronx workshop, Ms. Houle flips on a projector and introduces Tina and Ted, two fictional graduates whose profiles match what's typical of the latest data. Tina and Ted graduated from the same university, with the same degree. They work the same number of hours, in the same type of job. And yet, as they start their first jobs, Ted is making $4,000 more than Tina. In the second year, the difference has added up to almost $9,500. Why?
''Maybe he just talked up his work more,'' one woman, a marketing major, suggests.
''Maybe he was mentored by other men,'' another says.
''Or maybe,'' chimes in a third, a nursing student, ''she didn't know that she could negotiate.''
Bingo. Over the next three hours, these women are going to learn how to do it -- and to do it well.
There has clearly been much progress since President John F. Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act in 1963, mandating that men and women be paid equally for equal work. Yet nearly 50 years later, if you look at the data, progress toward that goal has stalled.
Of course, not all statistics are created equal. Some account for education and life choices like childbearing; some don't. But if you sift through the data, the reality is still clear: the gender gap persists -- and it persists for young, ambitious, childless women, too.
In October, the American Association of University Women -- co-sponsor of the Mount St. Vincent program -- offered a report called ''Graduating to a Pay Gap,'' in which it determined that in their first year out of college, women working full time earned just 82 percent of what their male peers did, on average. Again, women's choices -- college major, occupation, hours at work -- could account for some of this. Even so, the A.A.U.W. determined that one-third of the gap remained unexplained.
For years, legislators and women's advocates have been seeking solutions. In many ways, the wage gap is a complicated problem tied to culture, tradition and politics. But one part of it can be traced to a simple fact: many women just don't negotiate, or are penalized if they do. In fact, they are one-quarter as likely as men to do so, according to statistics from Carnegie Mellon University. So rather than wax academic about the issue, couldn't we simply teach women some negotiation skills?
Ms. Houle, along with Evelyn Murphy, the WAGE Project president and a former Massachusetts lieutenant governor, aims to do just that. For almost seven years, Ms. Houle has been training facilitators around the country and introducing their program into schools. (WAGE stands for ''women aim to get even.'')
Now, working in conjunction with the A.A.U.W., they plan to have negotiation workshops -- called Start Smart -- in place by spring in more than 300 colleges and universities nationwide. Nearly 30 colleges have already signed up for three-year commitments.
Several other organizations have also begun working with schools, Girl Scout programs and Y.W.C.A.'s to coach women before they enter the work force.
At Smith College, the Center for Work and Life recently began a program called Leadership for Rebels that teaches young women assertive communication skills, through role-playing and workshops. At Carnegie Mellon, the Heinz School of Public Policy and Management will start its first Negotiation Academy for Women next month, led by the economist Linda Babcock. She is also the founder of a program called ''Progress'' that aims to teach similar skills to 7- to 12-year-old girls.
''I do think that people are really starting to take this idea seriously,'' says Professor Babcock, a co-author of ''Women Don't Ask.'' ''I think they're starting to understand that we have to train the next generation of women when they're young.''
At Mount St. Vincent, the Draft 1 workshop is broken into sections: understanding the wage gap, learning one's worth on the market, and practical negotiation, in which students use role-playing in job-offer situations.
Women learn never to name a salary figure first, and to provide a range, not a number, if they're pressed about it. They are coached not to offer up a figure from their last job, unless explicitly asked. The use of terms like ''initial offer'' -- it's not final! -- is pounded into them. And, perhaps most important, they learn never, ever, to say yes to an offer immediately.
''I can't tell you how many times I hear stories of women who go into a negotiation saying, 'Oh my gosh, thank you so much, I'll take it!''' says Ms. Houle, noting that one student she coached even hugged her boss. ''Here these women are, more educated than ever, incurring incredible debt to get that education, and they're going to take whatever they're offered. It's like, 'No, no, no!' ''
Many reasons exist for women's fears about asking for higher pay.
There's the fear of being turned down. (''I think we take rejection personally,'' Ms. Murphy says.) There's the economy. (If you negotiate in a tough market, might the offer be rescinded?) There's the fact that women, in general, are less likely to take risks -- a business asset in the long run, but one that can make advocating for themselves tricky. There's also the reality that many women have internalized the idea that asking is somehow not ladylike.
''Girls and women intuit that speaking up can be dangerous to your reputation -- that asking for too much can be viewed as conceited or cocky,'' says Rachel Simmons, co-founder of the Girls Leadership Institute and a creator of the Leadership for Rebels program at Smith. ''This may begin on the playground, but it extends all the way into the workplace.''
Research by the Harvard senior lecturer Hanna Riley Bowles and others has found that women who negotiate are considered pushy and less likable -- and, in some cases, less likely to be offered jobs as a result.
That's why women's approach to negotiation is crucial. In one study, from Professor Babcock at Carnegie Mellon, men and women asked for raises using identical scripts. People liked the men's style. But the women were branded as aggressive -- unless they gave a smile while they asked, or appeared warm and friendly. In other words, they conformed to feminine stereotypes.
''The data shows that men are able to negotiate for themselves without facing any negative consequences, but when women negotiate, people often like them less and want to work with them less,'' says Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's chief operating officer, whose forthcoming book ''Lean In'' is about women and leadership. ''Even if women haven't studied this or seen this data, they often implicitly understand this, so they hold back.''
So, it's a balancing act. Ask, but ask nicely. Demand, but with a smile. It's not fair -- yet understanding these dynamics can be the key to overcoming them, Ms. Sandberg says.
The good news is that all of these things can be learned. In 2003, when Professor Babcock was conducting research for her book, she surveyed Carnegie Mellon graduates of the management school, determining that 13 percent of women had negotiated the salaries in the jobs they'd accepted, versus 52 percent of men. Four years later, after a lengthy book tour and talking relentlessly about these issues on campus, she found that the numbers had flipped: 68 percent of women negotiated, versus 65 percent of men.
Ms. Simmons put it this way: ''This is about muscles that need to be developed. This is about practice.''
AND practice they will, one workshop at a time.
At the session at Mount St. Vincent, the women researched median wages and practiced speaking clearly and warmly. They tried to remember the three T's: tone (be positive but persuasive), tactics (never name a salary figure first) and tips (sell yourself, but anticipate objections; don't get too personal, but be personal enough).
''It was nerve-racking,'' said Ria Grant, a nursing student.
''I stuttered,'' recalled Danielle Heumegni, a sociology major.
And yet they felt good.
''I realized there's a way to sell myself without feeling uncomfortable,'' Dominique Remy said.
''You won't get anything if you don't at least try,'' said Erika Pichardo.
''This,'' Ms. Heumegni said, waving her set of pink dollar bills in the air, ''was my aha! moment.''

HEADLINE: The Hottest Tickets of the Year

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF? Half a century after it exploded onto the American cultural scene, Edward Albee's biting examination of marriage as a grueling emotional battleground was revitalized yet again, making for the year's best show on Broadway. The Steppenwolf Theater production, directed by Pam MacKinnon, stars a revelatory Tracy Letts as the most commanding George I've seen, and Amy Morton as the most woundingly human Martha. Fight the fight for good theater on Broadway by making a visit to ''Virginia Woolf'' a priority. Trust me, you've never seen it like this before.
DETROIT As the country has crawled through the financial doldrums, it has sometimes seemed that American playwrights have been too shellshocked to confront the ugly truth of the new economic landscape. Then along came Lisa D'Amour's incisive, funny and disturbing comedy-drama about a middle-class couple clinging perilously to the middle class. Amy Ryan and David Schwimmer, along with Sarah Sokolovic and Darren Pettie, brought scorching life to Ms. D'Amour's dark portrait of Americans edging closer and closer to the abyss. 
THE PIANO LESSON The majesty, the humanity, even the sheer heft of August Wilson's work has a way of making much contemporary playwriting seem dismayingly puny. The Signature Theater Company, which opened a stylish new three-theater complex this year, reached a peak with this emotionally rewarding revival of Mr. Wilson's 1990 Pulitzer Prize winner, which runs through Jan. 13. Ruben Santiago-Hudson directed -- or should I say orchestrated? -- this matchless production, featuring an across-the-board terrific cast.
TITLE AND DEED/THE REALISTIC JONESES Will Eno had an impressive year, with not one but two excellent new plays. The Signature Theater presented his mordant meditation on our fragile purchase on life, ''Title and Deed,'' a solo show in the vein of his breakthrough work, ''Thom Pain (based on nothing).'' And the Yale Repertory Theater produced ''The Realistic Joneses,'' his moving portrait of two couples whose lives become intertwined as the specter of death lurks on the other side of the picket fence. Before taking up the cudgel as George, Mr. Letts gave another great performance here, alongside Parker Posey, whose off-kilter comic style suits Mr. Eno's distinctive writing perfectly.
THE ICEMAN COMETH The Goodman Theater's artistic director, Robert Falls, perhaps the finest American interpreter of Eugene O'Neill's plays today, assembled a superlative cast for his deeply probing revival of O'Neill's dark, majestic and devastating 1939 drama. Nathan Lane, as the salesman Hickey, and Brian Dennehy, as the ex-radical Larry Slade, were the name players, but the whole ensemble contributed to the haunting effect of this beautifully modulated Chicago production, which was the best -- and biggest, and saddest -- show I saw outside New York this year.
A GENTLEMAN'S GUIDE TO LOVE AND MURDER The year was not an inspiring one for new musicals -- or old ones either. (The only Broadway musical of any vintage I could heartily recommend was the Roundabout Theater Company's affectionate revival of ''The Mystery of Edwin Drood.'') My favorite new musical, which made its debut at Hartford Stage, was this inspired comedy about murder most British. Based on the same source material as the movie ''Kind Hearts and Coronets,'' this ebullient show starred a hard-working Jefferson Mays playing several heirs to a British fortune, most of whom start meeting most unfortunate and unexpected ends.
GOLDEN BOY Bartlett Sher, whose gut-wrenching 2006 Broadway revival of Clifford Odets's ''Awake and Sing!'' reminded us just how forceful that sometimes forgotten playwright's work could be, returned to Odets this fall with a similarly superb production of his 1937 drama about a young man torn between a big-money career in the boxing ring and the more humane rewards of a life devoted to art. With a cast of nearly 20 and Mr. Sher's regular design collaborators in top form, this richly atmospheric production found the emotional punch in a flawed but still powerful play.
DISGRACED Ayad Akhtar's incendiary drama had its schematic aspects: assemble one former Muslim, one African-American, one Jew and one WASP at a dinner table. Add the hot-button topic of religious faith -- particularly the rise of Islamism -- stir, and watch as things come to a boil. But Mr. Akhtar's trenchantly funny dialogue, and excellent performances from a cast led by the ''Daily Show'' correspondent Aasif Mandvi, helped the production transcend the play's contrivances, to make it one of the most provocative nights at the theater.
UNCLE VANYA The summer was highlighted by a mano-a-mano between two strikingly different productions of Chekhov's drama about misunderstandings and misalliances at an overpopulated country estate. Uptown, Cate Blanchett was the draw in a traditional -- and very fine -- production from Sydney. But in my view the winner in this unofficial ''Vanya''-off was the intimate, modern-dress production directed by Sam Gold for Soho Rep, in a new version by the terrific young playwright Annie Baker. The cast was a downtown dream team too: Michael Shannon as Astrov, Reed Birney as Vanya, Maria Dizzia as Yelena, to name just a few.
ONE MAN, TWO GUVNORS The National Theater's frisky adaptation of a commedia dell'arte classic -- ''The Servant of Two Masters'' -- was hands-down the funniest show of the year. That's thanks in no small measure to the sublime, Tony-laureled performance of James Corden as the jack-of-all-trades in 1960s London trying to keep his employers' lives on track, and himself out of trouble. Rarely have I heard as much out-of-control, please-make-it-stop laughter at the theater. I think my own abs are still sore.

HEADLINE: Finding Stimulation Along the Edges

BYLINE: By HOLLAND COTTER

 BODY:
FOR New York's big art institutions 2012 was a dull year at the top. Pragmatism prevailed. In one case this meant keeping strategic silence. The Metropolitan Museum stayed mum about specific plans for the Whitney's Breuer Building, which it will occupy in 2015, the day after tomorrow in scheduling terms, while it hired yet another curator of modern and contemporary art.
Everywhere marquee shows tended to be undisguised cash cows: plug in superstar names, do little of interest with them, watch the crowds herd through. Thus we were spoon-fed Warhol at the Met and Picasso at the Guggenheim. What did we learn? That Warhol influenced a lot of artists, and that Picasso painted in black and white. Who knew? 
At the Modern we got a celebrity-object show. Munch's 1895 pastel version of ''The Scream,'' notable for the $119.5 million it fetched at Sotheby's last May, is on a six-month loan to the museum from its new owner, the financier and MoMA trustee Leon Black. Otherwise undistinguished, it sits alone, sucking up attention, at the center of the museum's permanent galleries, accompanied by guards for crowd control.
And nice though it was to see veterans like Richard Artschwager and Yayoi Kusama, now in their 80s, taking solo spins at the Whitney Museum, you had to wonder why they'd been chosen over other deserving but less consistently rewarded contemporaries. That both have, in late career, come to be represented by Gagosian Gallery may be worth pondering.
Also worth a thought is whether mild events like the smartly installed Wade Guyton solo at the Whitney would have received the extensive notice it did if more challenging fare had been around this year. The 2012 Whitney Biennial at least did its job in locating a couple of recent trends: M.F.A. Outsider Art and Neo-Victoriana. Historians of the future should have fun with both. Walking through, I had flashes of the spookily ingenious Museum of Jurassic Technology in Los Angeles. And that's a compliment, pretty much.
In general during the year, though, you had to look off-center, either to smaller shows or smaller museums for stimulation, to find what you didn't already know, including revisionist views of two masters. ''Bernini: Sculpting in Clay,'' at the Met, offered one. Marble sculptures by the prodigious Baroque artist are rarely seen outside Italy. (The J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles brought some together in 2008.) The terra cotta models are in some ways even better than the final sculptures: the first, untrammeled thoughts of a supremely expressive hand and eye.
''Joseph Albers in America: Painting on Paper'' at the Morgan Library & Museum, while less spectacular, was even more surprising. Based on his precision-made series of geometric paintings ''Homage to the Square,'' Albers is often taken for a militantly uptight formalist. The sketches and color studies, peppered with written notes to self, in the Morgan show revealed a different artist entirely, the equivalent of a tantric adept, seeking aesthetic and spiritual expansion through discipline.
MoMA also went for the not-obvious in ''Tokyo 1955-1970: A New Avant-Garde.'' The show radically increases our knowledge of 20th century Japanese modernism, hitherto known, to the extent it is known at all, for the movement called Gutai. Gutai was there at MoMA, but so was much, much more, including a cache of immediately postwar Surrealist paintings familiar to practically no one, in or out of Japan.
No New York exhibition did a more impressive job of writing new history than the panoramic ''Caribbean: Crossroads of the World,'' which appeared simultaneously at El Museo del Barrio, the Studio Museum in Harlem and the Queens Museum of Art. The story told dates back centuries and comes into the present, and is an integral part of the fabric of New York City itself, an immigrant destination.
At the same time an extraordinary out-of-town show, ''Revealing the African Presence in Renaissance Art'' at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, brought comparable breadth to an even less-charted reality, that of an African European culture that the textbooks, until now, have left out.
Despite the bad economy the Whitney broke ground as planned on its new downtown building, while farther south, in Pennsylvania, the Barnes Foundation closed in one location and reopened as a new quasi-replica in another. One of the myths used to justify the move was that the museum -- which was also the home of its founder, Albert C. Barnes, in suburban Merion -- was too far from Philadelphia, though it was only nine miles from downtown. (Manhattan top to bottom is more than 13 miles.) Another was that the art, as installed to Barnes's specifications, was impossible to see there, which wasn't true, and anyway, revamped lighting would have solved any such problems.
The real problem seems to have been that the old Barnes was a no-frills, just-look-at-the-art place with no moneymaking amenities. The new, candy-box version in Philadelphia has a restaurant and a hangar-size hall ideal for party rentals. What's missing -- and I'm in a minority in thinking so -- are two elusive and unrecoverable elements, conceptual purpose and personality, which the old Barnes, like the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston, had in spades. America, with its blithe mania for updating and wrecking old things, puts its few, oddball total-work-of-art institutions in constant jeopardy. Now it has effectively eliminated one.
Still, the year comes to a close with at least one forceful preservationist gesture, this one made, perhaps surprisingly, by young people. On Dec. 3, 11 art students at Cooper Union in the East Village in Manhattan barricaded themselves inside the institution's main building to resist administrative plans for phasing out the century-old founding principle of giving full scholarships to all students admitted.
Cooper Union's founder, the industrialist and inventor Peter Cooper (1791-1883), expressly created it to be free, based on merit, for all students regardless of class, sex or race. Among its impressive list of alumni are many who would otherwise not have had access to art training. The occupation lasted just a week. But in protesting what they called Cooper Union's emphasis, coming from the top, ''on profitability over quality,'' they advanced an argument that will continue and has many applications. Their words sum up art in 2012; maybe their protest prefigured 2013.

HEADLINE: The Decline of Evangelical America

BYLINE: By JOHN S. DICKERSON. 
The senior pastor of Cornerstone Church and author of the forthcoming book ''The Great Evangelical Recession: Six Factors That Will Crash the American Church ... and How to Prepare.''

 BODY:
Prescott, Ariz.
IT hasn't been a good year for evangelicals. I should know. I'm one of them.
In 2012 we witnessed a collapse in American evangelicalism. The old religious right largely failed to affect the Republican primaries, much less the presidential election. Last month, Americans voted in favor of same-sex marriage in four states, while Florida voters rejected an amendment to restrict abortion.
Much has been said about conservative Christians and their need to retool politically. But that is a smaller story, riding on the back of a larger reality: Evangelicalism as we knew it in the 20th century is disintegrating.
In 2011 the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life polled church leaders from around the world. Evangelical ministers from the United States reported a greater loss of influence than church leaders from any other country -- with some 82 percent indicating that their movement was losing ground. 
I grew up hearing tales of my grandfather, a pastor, praying with President Ronald Reagan at the White House. My father, also a pastor, prayed with George W. Bush in 2000. I now minister to my own congregation, which has grown to about 500, a tenfold increase, in the last four years (by God's favor and grace, I believe). But, like most young evangelical ministers, I am less concerned with politics than with the exodus of my generation from the church.
Studies from established evangelical polling organizations -- LifeWay Research, an affiliate of the Southern Baptist Convention, and the Barna Group -- have found that a majority of young people raised as evangelicals are quitting church, and often the faith, entirely.
As a contemporary of this generation (I'm 30), I embarked three years ago on a project to document the health of evangelical Christianity in the United States. I did this research not only as an insider, but also as a former investigative journalist for an alt weekly.
I found that the structural supports of evangelicalism are quivering as a result of ground-shaking changes in American culture. Strategies that served evangelicals well just 15 years ago are now self- destructive. The more that evangelicals attempt to correct course, the more they splinter their movement. In coming years we will see the old evangelicalism whimper and wane.
First, evangelicals, while still perceived as a majority, have become a shrinking minority in the United States. In the 1980s heyday of the Rev. Jerry Falwell's Moral Majority, some estimates accounted evangelicals as a third or even close to half of the population, but research by the Notre Dame sociologist Christian Smith recently found that Christians who call themselves evangelicals account for just 7 percent of Americans. (Other research has reported that some 25 percent of Americans belong to evangelical denominations, though they may not, in fact, consider themselves evangelicals.) Dr. Smith's findings are derived from a three-year national study of evangelical identity and influence, financed by the Pew Research Center. They suggest that American evangelicals now number around 20 million, about the population of New York State. The global outlook is more optimistic, as evangelical congregations flourish in places like China, Brazil and sub-Saharan Africa.
But while America's population grows by roughly two million a year, attendance across evangelical churches -- from the Southern Baptists to Assembles of God and nondenominational churches -- has gradually declined, according to surveys of more than 200,000 congregations by the American Church Research Project.
The movement also faces a donation crisis as older evangelicals, who give a disproportionately large share, age. Unless younger evangelicals radically increase their giving, the movement will be further strained.
Evangelicals have not adapted well to rapid shifts in the culture -- including, notably, the move toward support for same-sex marriage. The result is that evangelicals are increasingly typecast as angry and repressed bigots. In 2007, the Institute for Jewish and Community Research, in a survey of 1,300 college professors, found that 3 percent held ''unfavorable feelings'' toward Jews, 22 percent toward Muslims and 53 percent toward evangelical Christians.
To be sure, college professors are not representative of the population, and, despite national trends of decline, evangelicals have many exceptional ministries. Most metropolitan areas in the United States have at least one thriving megachurch. In New York City, Redeemer Presbyterian and the Brooklyn Tabernacle pack multiple services every weekend. A handful of other churches, like North Point Community Church in Alpharetta, Ga., and Saddleback Church in Lake Forest, Calif., see more than 20,000 worshipers each weekend. Savvy ministers like the Rev. Craig Groeschel, founder of LifeChurch.tv, are using new technologies to deliver the ''good news.''
The pulse of evangelicalism is also shifting, in many ways for the good, from American politics to aid for the global poor, as evidenced in books by the Rev. David Platt, the Rev. Max Lucado and the Rev. Timothy Keller. Evangelicals are still a sophisticated lot, with billions in assets, millions of adherents and a constellation of congregations, radio stations, universities and international aid groups. But all this machinery distracts from the historical vital signs of evangelicalism: to make converts and point to Jesus Christ. By those measures this former juggernaut is coasting, at best, if not stalled or in reverse.
How can evangelicalism right itself? I don't believe it can -- at least, not back to the politically muscular force it was as recently as 2004, when white evangelicals gave President George W. Bush his narrow re-election. Evangelicals can, however, use the economic, social and spiritual crises facing America to refashion themselves into a more sensitive, spiritual and humble movement.
We evangelicals must accept that our beliefs are now in conflict with the mainstream culture. We cannot change ancient doctrines to adapt to the currents of the day. But we can, and must, adapt the way we hold our beliefs -- with grace and humility instead of superior hostility. The core evangelical belief is that love and forgiveness are freely available to all who trust in Jesus Christ. This is the ''good news'' from which the evangelical name originates (''euangelion'' is a Greek word meaning ''glad tidings'' or ''good news''). Instead of offering hope, many evangelicals have claimed the role of moral gatekeeper, judge and jury. If we continue in that posture, we will continue to invite opposition and obscure the ''good news'' we are called to proclaim.
I believe the cultural backlash against evangelical Christianity has less to do with our views -- many observant Muslims and Jews, for example, also view homosexual sex as wrong, while Catholics have been at the vanguard of the movement to protect the lives of the unborn -- and more to do with our posture. The Scripture calls us ''aliens and exiles'' (1 Peter 2:11), but American evangelicals have not acted with the humility and homesickness of aliens. The proper response to our sexualized and hedonistic culture is not to chastise, but to ''conduct yourselves honorably among the Gentiles, so that, though they malign you as evildoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God'' (1 Peter 2:12).
This does not mean we whitewash unpopular doctrines like the belief that we are all sinners but that we re-emphasize the free forgiveness available to all who believe in Jesus Christ.
Some evangelical leaders are embarrassed by our movement's present paralysis. I am not. Weakness is a potent purifier. As Paul wrote, ''I am content with weaknesses ... for the sake of Christ'' (2 Corinthians 12:10). For me, the deterioration and disarray of the movement is a source of hope: hope that churches will stop angling for human power and start proclaiming the power of Christ.
Simple faith in Christ's sacrifice will march on, unchallenged by empires and eras. As the English writer G. K. Chesterton put it, ''Christianity has died many times and risen again; for it had a God who knew the way out of the grave.''

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: The Wish-List Party

 BODY:
Readers rise to the challenge of inventing their own third party.
To the Editor:
Just because third parties haven't made inroads in presidential elections doesn't mean there is no place for them in American politics. A pragmatic progressive third party would recognize that a presidential bid is futile and would strive to elect representatives and senators who could caucus with the Democrats. This would push the Democrats to the left the way the Tea Party now pushes the Republicans to the right. Here are a few parties worth imagining:
The Occupy Party. There is something nostalgically charming about a revival of the idealistic but politically impotent theatrics of the 1960s left, as these days almost all the crazy people are on the right. But the Tea Party is a political force, and the Occupy movement is not, because the Tea Party backs candidates. Stop occupying the streets and start occupying the Capitol. 
The Realitarians. Realitarians base their conclusions on facts and valid arguments, regardless of where they sit on the political spectrum. Stephen Colbert was largely correct when he said that reality has a liberal bias. But not always. A Realitarian would reject Obamacare's reliance on the private sector because free market forces in the health care market always drive the price up. It doesn't matter why; it's a fact. Realitarians would also acknowledge politically incorrect facts about radiation, genetically modified organisms, Palestine and so on, regardless of where they sit on the political spectrum.
The Homestead Party. America took off economically in 1870 because those people who could not borrow money from parents were given ''gifts'' of land by the government. This created something like a level playing field for everyone, rich or poor. What we had approximated, to put it in Representative Paul D. Ryan's terms, was equality of opportunity, not equality of outcome. The way we can create comparable opportunities in the modern world is for government to create an infrastructure that makes education and capital available to everyone, then gets out of the way.
Let's hear readers' ideas for new parties to broaden the political spectrum.
TEED ROCKWELL Berkeley, Calif., Dec. 10, 2012
The writer is a lecturer in philosophy at Sonoma State University.
Readers React
In a deeply divided nation, the objective of a new party must be to corral the reality-based centrist-moderates and focus them on the single issue that most affects us all: fiscal responsibility. That means identifying what a growing and responsible nation needs for its people, and having all of us meet our proportional obligations to pay for it. This new political force might well be called the Grown-Ups Party.
Let's hear it for the G.U.P.! NOEL KELLIHER East Hartford, Conn., Dec. 12, 2012
How about the Grassroots Party, a pipe dream of a party not beholden to corporate interests, lobbyists or billionaire donors? The party will announce from Day 1 that it will not accept donations of over $18, allowing it to function as a party that is actually of the people, by the people and for the people. This would seem to be the most direct (and perhaps only) path toward promoting sensible social, economic, environmental and foreign policy.
YITZHAK BRONSTEIN Be'er Milka, Israel, Dec. 13, 2012
I suggest the Wet 'n' Dry Party for people who live either where the oceans will soon reach or where the rains have stopped. This would alter the national red/blue map by politically bringing together folks who may soon need to move toward one another geographically. Instead of an elephant or a donkey, the party's symbol would be a thermometer.
JOCK HOFFMAN Arlington, Mass., Dec. 12, 2012
''A pragmatic progressive'' political party is the ne plus ultra of American political fantasy. It expresses unarguable values: Progress is what we all want, and all politics should be pragmatic. The question is: Why don't we have it? Why do we have a conservative movement based on frantic spin and outright mendacity, but no true progressive movement opposing it based on facts?
1) Money. The facts have no real constituency, whereas profit always has the resources to defend itself against inconvenient facts.
2) Simplicity bias. Data are usually complex -- you can tell a much simpler story if you ignore the data.
3) The American electorate. Our problem is not that we lack a pragmatic progressive party, but that we lack the pragmatic progressive movement such a party would represent.
The data clearly show, as Mr. Rockwell writes, that ''free market forces in the health care market always drive the price up,'' yet the only reasonable response to those facts -- a universal, single-payer, not-for-profit health care system -- was never even on the table.
Unfortunately, those of us who fantasize about an intelligent American politics are fantasizing indeed. We have the government -- and the health care, the tax structure, the gun control, the infrastructure, the social safety net, the deficit -- that we deserve, as evidenced by the fact that we keep electing it over and over again.
DAVID BERMAN New York, Dec. 12, 2012
Here's another idea for a progressive party operating alongside or, when necessary, within the Democrats: the Universalists. Its members would advocate social programs benefiting everyone, regardless of income, geography or industry. Think of Social Security, Medicare or public education. After all, such programs have met with the most success in promoting fairness in our society -- and unsurprisingly have enjoyed the most consistent public support.
Moving forward, Universalists would favor single-payer health care, for example, or public prekindergarten education for all. They would also favor shared responsibility, such as compulsory national service. Creating a common baseline for opportunity, not income or achievement, would be the animating vision.
BURTON GLASS Dorchester, Mass., Dec. 12, 2012
When people ask me about my party affiliation I tell them that I am a fiscal conservative and a social progressive and that neither party wholly represents my views. The closest catchy phrase I've come up with to describe my views is Bleeding Heart Conservative, though that doesn't sound like a good name for a political party.
ZELL LUNDBERG Lakewood, Colo., Dec. 12, 2012
Imagine a Central Party. Let it admit members a pair at a time, one Republican and one Democrat joining simultaneously. Or one left-leaning independent with one right-leaning independent. They will commit to seeking compromise on one issue after another. Although they perhaps will not be satisfied completely, they will realize that compromise is best for the nation.
ALAN LARSON Dunwoody, Ga., Dec. 12, 2012
Third parties exist, mirroring Mr. Rockwell's imaginary ones. But they are ruthlessly kept off the ballot by the Democrats and the Republicans in most states. In Pennsylvania, a minor-party candidate in 2012 had to get more than 20,000 signatures of registered voters to get on the ballot. Because minor-party candidate petitions are almost always subject to challenge, double that number is usually advisable. And when a candidate is shoved off the ballot, he or she is typically sued by the challengers for the costs of the challenge. For two recent candidates who persevered, that penalty was in excess of $80,000. Third party indeed.
ALEXANDER GILLETT Philadelphia, Dec. 12, 2012
A democratic structure that allows for multiple parties could serve to introduce fresh ideas and marginalize ideologues. But we will not develop a multiparty system simply by wishing for it or by coming up with a catchy name.
We have a two-party system because our representatives are elected on the basis of winner-take-all districts, rather than proportional representation. Under our vote-counting structure it is nearly impossible for a new party to test out new ideas, winning a small number of seats at first and expanding its representation if the voters approve of its positions.
Under a multiparty system the Tea Party would hold perhaps 5 percent of the seats in Congress, the Evangelical Party another 5 percent perhaps, and let's say the Business Party might attract 25 percent. Other groups on the right and the left would fill out the seats.
Under such a system Mitt Romney would have been able to stand his ground as a leader of the Business Party in the primaries and would not have needed to constantly flip-flop and pander to the far right. For the general election, Mr. Romney might have formed a coalition with the far right and lost, or he might have succeeded in forming a coalition with a center-left party, possibly unseating President Obama.
Our two-party system is not God-given. It is time to change how we count votes and to end the despotism of dysfunction.
DAVID RANDOLPH Sunnyvale, Calif., Dec. 12, 2012
How about a Common Sense Party? It seems it's been a long, long time since political parties have evidenced common sense.
NINA BOUSKA Hidden Valley Lake, Calif., Dec. 12, 2012
America desperately needs a political party that dares to speak the word that must not be spoken: communism. A communist party that advocates the expropriation not of private property but of the means of production; that stands for the swift elimination of obscene inequalities of wealth and income; that disavows nationalism and its cousins, the military budget and constant war; that helps people empower themselves in their workplaces and communities.
Look at how our political system torturously debates whether to increase the taxes of the rich by just 3 percent! We desperately need to be talking about fundamental changes in the structure of our society, our economy and our government apparatus.
If 100,000 organizers were daring enough to come out of the closet and call themselves communists, perhaps we could move decisively toward a fairer, more just, more democratic society, with true equality of opportunity and a reasonable certainty of fulfilling work.
MARC KAGAN New York, Dec. 12, 2012
The Grateful Dead Party. A loosely knit mélange of intensely loyal rednecks, preppies and New Agers from all 50 states espousing a mostly libertarian philosophy and requiring that all of its candidates disregard Congressional dress codes and never give the same speech twice.
CHARLIE HATHAWAY Tenafly, N.J., Dec. 12, 2012
The Writer Responds
What Mr. Berman calls ''intelligent American politics'' is history, not fantasy. The 1850s voter may have been racist, sexist, violent, drunk or unwashed, but he stood in mud for three hours critically comparing Lincoln and Douglas. Those citizens took voting seriously. Also, we don't always get the government we ask for. Gov. Jerry Brown of California and President Obama received overwhelming liberal mandates, then cut public services. Why? Too little leftward pressure, and plenty of rightward pressure.
If Mr. Larson's Central Party is held together only by the members' disagreement, then compromise would destroy it. If a leftist shifts right after arguing with a colleague, would he be thrown out to maintain balance?
Mr. Glass's Universalist ''baseline for opportunity'' is essential for a modern Homestead Act. A government-maintained infrastructure that provides education and capital provides a 21st-century replacement for free farmland. Libertarians use ''invisible hand-waving'' to imply the free market eliminates the need for any infrastructure, but only God creates something out of nothing. The rest of us rely on some combination of parents and the government to get us started.
Single-issue parties (Mr. Kelliher's G.U.P., Mr. Hoffman's Wet 'n' Dry) usually either get what they want, or the public decides it isn't worth wanting. Either way, they don't last long.
Mr. Hathaway's Grateful Dead Party could last longer by avoiding the issues altogether and relying on inspiration. Deadhead libertarianism combines community with independence in ways that make it far preferable to the Wall Street version.

HEADLINE: What's a Store For?

BYLINE: By CATHY HORYN

 BODY:
The elevator door opened in the Sutton Place penthouse of Richard Perry, the hedge-fund manager, and there he stood in the white foyer wearing a black knit suit whose slumping shoulders made him look like a bony country parson. Perry is a man of meticulous habit, a super-athlete who prides himself on his sophisticated sense of style. He has a closetful of suits by Thom Browne and Lanvin that don't have shoulders that slant like a roof. This one was a blip of misjudgment. But Perry, no doubt out of devotion to his wife, Lisa, a fashion designer who made the suit in the same double knit she uses for her mod dresses, decided to wear it that night. And it was an evening of some importance, for the Perrys were off to a party at Barneys -- their first since Richard bought the renowned specialty store. 
''Welcome! Welcome!'' he boomed as I stepped off the elevator. A moment later, from the apartment's depths, Lisa appeared, a small, sunny woman with ageless girl-next-door features and tawny hair cut in a chic mop. Lisa grew up in the north suburbs of Chicago and still retains, after more than 30 years in New York, a Midwestern accent, along with an easy friendliness. She was wearing a yellow-and-gray-print dress of her own design and high heels.
Richard was keen to show me the apartment, which is something else. It is a pure example of the Pop and neo-Pop aesthetics in that everything is magnified and lurid, like the huge Jeff Koons metallic green diamond planted on the terrace, visible from the foyer -- and a source of vexation with a neighbor, who claimed the rock emits a laser-strength glare. (Richard dismisses the gripe as baseless.) The apartment is like someone's idea in 1963 of a home of the future, down to the panoramic curve of the living room, the bottomless whiteness and the oval leather sofa large enough to seat 30. On the walls hang paintings by Roy Lichtenstein and Jim Dine. It's not a room for relaxing; even trays of hard candies, displayed with absurd precision, seem to treat enjoyment strictly as a still life.
Far from being the white elephant that some supposed when the Perrys bought the penthouse in 2000 for $10.9 million (the main drawback was its two ballrooms), the place fed new goals for the couple. Lisa, at one time an abortion-rights advocate and a Democratic fund-raiser (''I really wanted Hillary to be president,'' she says, and to illustrate the couple's regard, a portrait of Hillary by Chuck Close hangs in the apartment), had begun to collect '60s fashion, like Courrèges. Strangers would often ask her who designed her outfit, she said, and ''that's when the light bulb went off.'' By 2007, she was selling Lisa Perry creations at stores like Jeffrey and Bergdorf Goodman. She persuaded artists or their heirs, like Lichtenstein's widow, Dorothy, to let her reproduce artwork on her designs, for a small percentage of sales (that is then donated to the artist's cause). But she was bedeviled by the pressures of a small wholesale operation, so she decided to focus just on her shop on Madison Avenue and some kids' clothes for Barneys. By that time, and perhaps not wholly coincidentally, Richard had bought a large amount of Barneys' debt. He had also endorsed his wife's Pop aesthetic, buying all the biggest art guns. It astonished Lisa how far he went. She said: ''I was going to do Pop Art lite, I call it -- stuff that looked like Pop Art. Warholesque.'' She laughed at how this sounded. She said that it was the analyst in her husband that made him want to dig deep, ''whether it's a company, whatever it is.'' Before their Pop Art phase, they collected French Empire antiques, and Richard would crawl under tables to see how they were put together. The apartment makes Lisa happy, but she admitted: ''I even walk around saying, 'Do I really live here?' I did not grow up like this.'' Richard described his art foray in candy-store terms, saying he went through a book on Pop Art and said, ''I'll take this, this and this.'' But that's a typical bit of Perry swagger. (If he made the gluttonous ''this and this'' comment, the art adviser Dominique Levy, who has worked with the Perrys for a decade, said it was not to her, and that Perry pushed to make unexpected choices.)
Richard motioned me over to the window to peer at the green diamond, which would look just dandy on the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree.
He said, ''Did you know that Koons considers it a symbol of human creation?''
Lisa laughed tensely. ''Richard, I don't think Jeff meant -- ''
''No, no, it's interesting,'' he said, springing into a description of how the prongs were sperm attacking the ovum. When he finished he bent his head toward me and, with a sheepish grin, said, ''I'm a little bit of a nerd.''
We settled into the small library, where the books were arranged by color, for a drink before going to the party. I wanted to know what Richard thought of Barneys' newly renovated first floor, which replaced the elegant, residential feel of Peter Marino's original concept with a sleek design marked off by handbag-filled shelves. Because Richard's hedge fund, Perry Capital, closed on the deal to acquire Barneys New York from Istithmar World, Dubai's sovereign wealth fund, in early May, he had no input in this remodel, nor in the new shoe floor that replaced the once-intimate wood-paneled salon. The changes were initiated by Barneys' C.E.O., Mark Lee, who arrived in September 2010, after running Gucci, and by the creative director Dennis Freedman, formerly of W magazine and a longtime friend of Lee's, who is in charge of windows and other visuals. Critics complained that Barneys was now merely offering the traditional menu of the globalized mercantile world, with its buffet of high-margin shoes and bags. Among the descriptions I heard were that the new Barneys looked like a mall or a duty-free shop. ''It looks like Macy's but a bit more high-end,'' Ronnie Cooke Newhouse, creative director at Barneys in the early '90s, told me, adding, ''It's so out of step with where things are going.''
When I asked Richard what he thought of the main floor, his face and lips grew rigid, as though something unpleasant-tasting were being offered to him. Puzzled, I glanced at Lisa, who glanced at Richard, then back to me and said: ''Look at him, you freaked him out! He won't even speak now.'' She said to me, seriously, ''I think it's a really good question.''
Richard remained stone-faced on the divan. Finally, I realized that it wasn't the question but my turning on the tape recorder that had unnerved him. ''Do you want me to turn it off?'' I asked.
His wife smiled at him. ''You'll feel better, sweetie.''
And he said, sulkily, ''Lisa can talk.''
''No, we want your input, too,'' she said.
I turned off the recorder and got out my notebook.
Immediately his face relaxed and he spoke freely, excitedly. Sure, bags are profitable, he said, but look how they have become these highly sought-after objects. They deserve to be presented in a gallery, which in his view is what the main floor resembles.
''But it's a sea of bags,'' I said. ''Is that really Barneys?''
He smiled. ''I think bags are the most beautiful art in the market today.''
It was nearly 9 p.m. when we pulled up to Barneys (the Perrys' 26-year-old son, David, rode with us; their other child, David's twin, Samantha, arrived later). Several store executives, including Lee and Freedman, were waiting on the sidewalk to greet the Perrys. The purpose of the party was to kick off windows that Freedman had conceived with Dakis Joannou, a Greek art patron. Each one featured an artist's impression of the fashion world. Juergen Teller's giant portrait of an aging Yves Saint Laurent brutally reduced the king to a coifed has-been. Another artist, John Bock, was already upstairs at the restaurant Freds creating one-off garments from old clothes.
Stepping out of the car, the Perrys embraced the artist Leo Villareal and his wife, Yvonne Force Villareal. Leo said, ''So this is your baby!'' Richard grinned, and started for the door.
''Who's the guy with the bangs?'' he asked, pausing. I told him it was the fashion photographer Vinoodh Matadin, who had come to the party with his wife and partner, Inez van Lamsweerde. After being introduced, Lisa said, ''I'm such a fan of your work.'' Van Lamsweerde looked blankly after the man in the strange knit suit. When I explained that he'd just bought Barneys, she said, ''Oh!''
Upstairs, the party was in full roar. At Bock's platform, a crowd stood transfixed by his assemblages. ''This is great,'' Richard said, delighted. ''This is the kind of thing we should be doing.'' Later, meeting Teller, he told the photographer, at ease in red shorts and a bulky sweater, that his Y.S.L. image reminded him of the '60s nouveaux-réalistes, like Jacques de la Villeglé, who used torn street posters in his work. To which Teller replied, impassively, ''Oh, yeah?''
Around 10:30, the Perrys decided to leave. Crossing the main floor, we passed a wall of shelves. And Lisa said, ''You know, it is a sea of bags.'' She turned to her husband and repeated the remark.
But Richard, in full stride, said, ''I think they're beautiful.''
Barney Pressman opened his men's clothing shop in 1923, the same year that his son, Fred, was born. By opening a tiny store on Seventh Avenue in Chelsea, an area of warehouses and stinking abattoirs that was losing residents while much of the rest of the city boomed, Barney was truly taking the long view. The good shopping was around Herald Square, at Macy's and Gimbels, or at B. Altman's and later Saks on Fifth Avenue; and there were dozens of well-established haberdashers, like Brooks Brothers, Weber & Heilbroner and John David, that could outfit a man in style. Leading suit manufacturers, like Hickey Freeman and Oxxford, did not care to sell to Barney; for one thing, he undercut their retail prices. So he went around them. He bought suits from stores in the South and then would replace the famous labels with his own, enraging the manufacturers even more. He sold thousands of bootleg suits. There was an audacity about Barney. Stenciled on his window, almost overlooked for the profusion of suits, homburgs, and walking sticks, were the words ''For the Man Who Knows.'' Men went to Barneys for quality and price, even if some fibbed to their friends that their suits came from Saks.
When Barney retired, in 1975, annual revenues were nearly $35 million, according to Joshua Levine's history, ''The Rise and Fall of the House of Barneys,'' and Fred had put Barneys on the high road, selling pricey Brioni suits and other wonders of Italian design. In the story of Barneys, Fred, who died in 1996, tends to be overshadowed by his sons, Gene and Bob, who became much more visible from the mid-'80s until its bankruptcy in 1996. But Fred is the one who made the name synonymous with New York savvy.
''I was taught by my father -- there was no better merchant on the planet,'' Gene said when we met over a drink at the Four Seasons. ''Nothing was ever good enough.'' He was wearing jeans, a white button-down and a tan Belvest jacket custom-made for his dad in the '80s. He still had the immense self-assurance that struck some as arrogant and others as inspiring when he was running Barneys. (''I don't care what people think. I care about what I think.'') He removed his jacket and tossed it over the back of the banquette.
Belvest is a small Italian firm that Fred came across in the early '70s. It was Belvest -- with fabrics selected by Fred -- that Giorgio Armani used in 1976 to make the first unconstructed suits he sold in the United States exclusively at Barneys. This was before anyone had heard of Armani, and it was Fred who told him what he wanted for his customers, who picked the swatches, and then had him sign an exclusive for future products. When Armani's relaxed look became a sensation, Barneys was the only store that carried the clothes, and, needless to say, this had a huge impact on Fred's business. Exclusives were not unusual -- they make a store unique, and if done properly, they allow a merchant to control his prices -- but Fred's level of involvement was unusual. He prescribed the cuts he wanted. If he thought a suit's lapels were too wide, he told the manufacturer how much to trim them. In the '60s, he began in earnest to seek out family-run firms in Italy like Piatelli that made fine, hand-tailored garments. He did the same with makers of shirts, ties and gloves. He went to France and England, repeating the search. Fred could be stunningly single-minded, and that may explain his own disheveled appearance -- ''a miracle of shabby chic,'' Simon Doonan, Barneys' former window dresser turned roving ambassador, once said. For a good decade, Fred had Europe virtually to himself, since most of his competitors sold only American-made suits. But Fred believed strongly that it was his job, or his buyers', to guide his customers' tastes, which in the '60s were evolving anyway. This decision was good for business, but it also reflected his view that beautiful things, in addition to giving a sophisticated appearance, could expand your horizon. A comment you hear over and over, from vendors to salesmen, is how much they learned from Fred.
Barneys was still primarily a men's store in the late '70s, when Gene introduced women's fashion. Shortly after that, his mother, Phyllis, started selling housewares and antiques in a section called Chelsea Passage. After that, the store rapidly evolved into a cool downtown alternative to glitzier stores like Bergdorf's. Gene continued to observe Fred's mantra about exclusives. He snagged Azzedine Alaïa, the Tunisian-born designer who was dressing Grace Jones and every hot model and editor in skintight black outfits, and later, an unknown Miuccia Prada, who was transforming her family's leather-goods business with her sexy-dowdy fashion. In 1986, Barneys opened its new women's store, with its majestic staircase, and Gene hired Doonan to perform his window magic. As far as Gene was concerned, the freakier the displays, the better. ''My thing was to just aggravate and shake things up,'' Gene said. But these changes can scarcely explain the tremendous shift in the '80s. After all, Barneys didn't pioneer interesting store design. And New Yorkers had already been entertained by Marvin Traub's extravagant productions at Bloomingdale's, by the brilliant windows of Robert Currie at Bendel's and Lynn Hershman at Bonwit Teller (where famously a mannequin was posed with her hand crashing through the glass, as if wanting to join the action outside).
Without taking anything away from the atmosphere that the Pressmans created in the '80s, the frenzy had a lot to do with demographics: namely, the rise of the yuppie. Gene would no doubt hate the tag and, on the face of it, it seems loony hanging on an Alaïa or a Prada. But New York at the time was being defined by its ''arrogant, smart children,'' in the words of James B. Lindheim, a marketing executive (and later the chairman of Burson-Marsteller), in a 1975 article in Harper's. Unlike previous generations, this new class, Lindheim said, would seek to define itself by what it consumed -- be it contemporary art or dead-chic black. And Barneys was their store.
Like Doonan's windows, Barneys ads in the late '80s and '90s had a topical flavor and caught the ironic, self-involved tone of the city's new art stars and Wall Street millionaires. (In one of Jean-Philippe Delhomme's serial illustrations for a 1993 catalog, the scene is a cocktail party, with the typical line: ''Raoul was the perfect host, but Eleanor owned everything.'') Ronnie Newhouse, part of the team behind those witty ads, told me that Gene ''always wanted to push things. 'Oh, that's boring. Anyone can do that. Come back to me with a better idea.' '' There was a distinct sense of connoisseurship, of people cultivating less a style than an identity based on style theories, like the minimalism of Helmut Lang or the bag-lady chic of Comme des Garçons. It was ripe for parody. I laughed when Newhouse reminded me that ''Barneys was always the store for people who didn't like color.''
I asked Newhouse what she thought made the store different.
She said: ''It was very attached to a New York culture, in the same way that Woody Allen was in film. It was kind of the sense that the customers were the enlightened New Yorkers. At the time, Bergdorf's felt like a store for uptown doctors' wives, and Barneys was where the cool people shopped, and the cultural elite. People in the know.''
In 1999, after 76 years of ownership, the Pressmans lost their store in spectacular fashion: in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, after getting into a fight with their Japanese partner, who had financed a multimillion-dollar expansion in the early '90s, which included the Madison Avenue store and branches in Chicago and Beverly Hills. Since then, Gene Pressman hasn't had much to do with Barneys, and over our drink he said it was hard to talk about the store. ''I've known Mark Lee a long time, and I like Mark a lot,'' he said. ''He's a bright guy. He has great respect for the family and has been kind to me. He has a vision for Barneys, and I guess time will tell.'' Gene had not met Perry. ''I would assume he's not pretending to be a merchant.'' It's clear, though, that Gene is keeping an eye on what happens at the store. He said, ''Just because somebody goes and builds a big shoe floor, and then the next guy goes and builds a bigger shoe floor, is not reinventing yourself.''
I asked him about the Barneys windows. To many, last year's Lady Gaga holiday theme was a sellout. (Or as a former executive said, ''Two years too late,'' adding: ''The Barneys customer doesn't want a Lady Gaga Christmas ornament for $50. They don't care. They want beautiful things.'') Nevertheless, the store moved some 90,000 Gaga products, and Lee says traffic led to record December sales.
Still, the windows and the stripping away of the architectural character are perhaps the biggest source of complaint about the store's new direction. Last year, Tim Howe, the visual director of the Chicago store, quit, convinced that the creative and communal atmosphere of the company had wilted under Lee and Freedman. Howe told me that the visual brief from Lee was to get rid of the wacky or snarky tone and make things cleaner.
That was fine, Howe said, ''but there wasn't this infusion of a new creativity or vision. How are we going to set ourselves apart?'' Howe, who, like other visual managers in the branches, was used to an open, weekly exchange with the New York staff, said that he never had a conversation with Freedman. ''My perception was he didn't know how to relate to us,'' Howe said. He found the Gaga choice ''embarrassing,'' and he said: ''The beauty of Barneys was that it had a small-store mentality; it was allowed to do things that were different and creative. It was the last holdout.''
Gene wonders if the whole idea of the professionally dressed, creative window isn't tired at this point. ''If I had a store again, I wouldn't have windows,'' he said. ''My windows would be looking into the store. Because I'm done with hip windows. There's nothing else you can do. I would be thinking about the energy from within, about creating environments, seeing hot people.''
He paused, musing. ''A store once famous for windows -- no more windows -- that's definitely different enough.''
Shortly after Perry took control of Barneys in May, I met him in the offices of Perry Capital, in the General Motors Building in Midtown. He founded the hedge fund in 1988, after more than a decade at Goldman Sachs, where he was a Robert Rubin protégé. Over the next 20 years, his fund returned an annual average of 15.4 percent. Early in the subprime-mortgage crisis, he and his investors reaped a return of $1 billion by shorting subprime securities. He's an opportunistic investor with a contrarian streak: ''Everything that people hate, I buy,'' he told me.
Then in the fall of 2008, right after Fortune magazine ran a glowing profile in which Perry discussed his investment strategy, the world changed. That year Perry's fund dropped 27 percent, mostly because of a position it had taken in Volkswagen. It became clear to him that huge economic currents could easily swamp the bottom-line value analysis he had used so successfully since his days at Goldman. Over the next few years, Perry made an all-out effort to understand the European debt crisis and its investment impact. He went to London, Paris, Brussels, Berlin, speaking to bankers and politicians; he reckons he knows more people in the German Bundestag than in the U.S. Congress. Today, Perry Capital has positions in A.I.G., a Texas utility, an Icelandic bank and a German apartment complex, among other securities. Its year-to-date return is about 12.5 percent.
When Perry greeted me that afternoon at his office, he wore a gorgeous slate-gray Lanvin suit with a white Thom Browne button-down and a narrow silver-striped tie, and on his sockless feet were moccasins. Even when he was at Goldman he displayed a well-developed sense of style that made him an anomaly at the bank. He slouched in his chair, his gaze direct. Although famously press-shy, he filled the next two and a half hours with lively and at times confessional talk -- about his childhood, his career, his opinions on fashion. We met on three more occasions, and each time he made a conscientious effort to explain himself or a point.
Born in Los Angeles, the second of three children, Perry spent his boyhood in Chicago, where his father ran a company that made photocopiers and other office equipment. The family then moved to New York. When he was 13, his parents divorced. In the few interviews Perry has given, the subject of financial hardship comes up with a sense of deliberateness. Not that he was impoverished -- he graduated from Milton Academy and the Wharton School, and his uncle is James Cayne, the former C.E.O. of Bear Stearns -- but he did work in a movie theater after his father cut him off, and he later earned his M.B.A. at night at New York University. He seems to want to connect to a sense of struggle. On his library walls are iconic images of the civil rights movement, of the Freedom Riders, and he has visited the route of the Selma-to-Montgomery march, as well as countries with a history of human rights abuses. (''Some people go to South Africa for safari; I went to study apartheid,'' he says.) He believes his success is the result of his own hard work and intelligence. ''Whether it's right or wrong,'' he once told me, ''I think differently than anyone else I know. If I listen to a management presentation, I get to what I consider the essential fact. And I often get to a very different fact than what other people get to.''
An investor who knows Perry agrees.''He's done it on his terms,'' he told me. ''He hasn't compromised who he is. He's still the same guy he was 30 years ago. He's smart. He's kind of goofy. He talks too loud, he laughs too loud. He hasn't modulated any of those things, which is likable. He lets his wife enjoy this fantasy existence of a 1960s sensibility. He looks like this uncomfortable person in the middle of this stage set of an apartment. He's been pretty shrewd about the value of art.'' But about Barneys, the investor wondered aloud, ''Does Richard have the gumption and expertise to really do the hard things to manage it?''
Maybe the most surprising thing about Perry's involvement in Barneys is that he got involved at all. His firm hasn't made other high-end retail investments. In fact, Perry thinks luxury retail is a bad business for most investors -- too many risks, too many divas. But more than that, he said, ''I would have thought it was vanity. And I think if you look at my career, I avoid vanity.''
But to hear Perry tell it, the decision to trade in Barneys' debt was a straightforward one: here was an overleveraged asset whose name made it a minimal investment risk. If he wound up owning the asset for a few hundred million dollars -- roughly his debt position -- he could eventually sell it for a lot more. No matter how difficult the retail environment, there would always be someone who wanted to own Barneys for the right price. ''My thinking wasn't much more profound than that,'' he said.
In 2007, Istithmar acquired Barneys for $942 million in a bidding contest with Fast Retailing, the Japanese company that owns Uniqlo. The colossal sum reflected the rage for luxury goods and the Dubai firm's belief that it could open Barneys stores in global cities like Beijing. These were shaky suppositions. Only three years before, Jones Apparel Group had paid just $400 million for Barneys. Even if the company's value could be increased, Istithmar had borrowed nearly $500 million to finance the deal. Perry's purchase of roughly $300 million in Barneys' credit gave him control of the debt and therefore, potentially, the equity if Istithmar decided to unload Barneys. ''That's kind of the way it played,'' said an executive involved in Barneys during the Jones era. ''From what I know, Richard played a very calculated and brilliant strategy.'' (The other major debt holder was Ronald Burkle's firm, the Yucaipa Companies, whose stake was somewhat smaller, though many believed Burkle was also keen to own Barneys.) In any case, by 2009, Istithmar's problems were compounded by Dubai's exploding debt crisis. As an executive then working at the struggling store said, ''We were a pimple on their butt in comparison.''
As the recession cut into property values and 401(k)'s, stores became ghost towns. Istithmar had been unable to lure a new chief for Barneys since the departure of its former C.E.O., Howard Socol. For two years the store was run by Istithmar executives in conjunction with a seven-member management team, most from the Pressman era, who naturally felt protective of the Barneys legacy. Their biggest concerns were getting rid of excess inventory and maintaining enough cash to stay liquid. To stay on top of the crisis in 2009, the team convened war-room-style meetings almost daily. During one period, when several factoring companies briefly ordered vendors to stop shipping to Barneys out of fear that it couldn't pay, the mood in the meetings was particularly tense, with bankruptcy counsel on standby on at least one occasion. A former executive said: ''Frankly, being shut down [by the factors] saved us. We got out of the inventory. We had to be incredibly nimble.''
Perry, meanwhile, was brazen in his demands, according to several former executives who declined to speak on the record. ''Basically he was looking into the creditor agreements and trying to find every possible way to throw the asset into bankruptcy,'' the former executive said. ''He would ask for reappraisals of the inventory. Every time he zigged, we had to zag.''
Perry doesn't deny that he put pressure on Barneys. ''Yes, it was pressure,'' he said. ''In hindsight, they didn't understand their credit agreements. And if they didn't have someone like me to come to, they would have gone into bankruptcy.'' He said that in addition to annual interest of more than $50 million, Barneys had roughly $150 million due this past fall. ''So where's the sponsor? It wasn't going to happen. Because they couldn't make it happen.'' He went on, ''There was a very pleasant understanding between us and them once they realized it was game over.''
Another former executive said, ''His attitude was basically, 'You guys will never be able to make it work, so why don't you just hand over the company.' He was a bit pompous.'' By spring 2012, the deal was done. Burkle received cash plus 20 percent in equity and a board seat. (''He's been completely pleasant,'' Perry said.) Istithmar got about 8 percent equity and a board seat, so it still had something to show for its involvement. And Barneys was able to shed all but $50 million of its long-term debt.
''Richard looks like the savior of Barneys,'' said that same former executive. ''And the irony is there was nothing wrong with the company.'' There's some truth to this: Barneys may have needed a cash infusion, or to restructure its debt, and certainly the Madison Avenue store was overdue for a face lift, but many of the woes caused by the financial crisis had lifted by 2010 as people began to shop again.
This fall, six months after the deal went through, Lisa's designs appeared in one of the windows at Barneys. When I asked Richard about the appearance of a conflict of interest, he was quick to rationalize that it wasn't favoritism since his wife's clothes were sold at Barneys before he bought it. He said, ''Listen, if it turns out Lisa's line is not doing well, I think Daniella'' -- Barneys' C.O.O. and top merchant, Daniella Vitale -- ''will have a tough conversation with her.''
He dismisses as ''laughable'' the idea that he bought the store for Lisa. But it's possible that the Barneys purchase involves vanity of another kind: that Perry wants to be lionized for turning around a New York institution. ''I think that may be what he aspires to,'' says an investor who knows him. ''He certainly could have sold his position in the company. . . . He was approached by a lot of private-equity guys.''
Great stores reflect the cultural life and aesthetic priorities of a city. For the 75 years that the Pressmans ran Barneys, their energies flowed in time with New York -- the crazy maneuverings of Barney, the postwar expansiveness of Fred, the arrogance of Gene. Now comes the age of Richard Perry. What will his Barneys look like?
To be sure, there is an awful lot Perry doesn't know about high-end retailing. His insights into fashion and store management have accrued mainly as a shopper. ''The whole Exclusively Ours, the XO idea''-- a program of Barneys-only labels started by Lee -- ''is where I think we're going more and more,'' he told me. ''Lisa and I were at Colette, and she bought a bag that was exclusively Colette. That's why she bought it.'' He paused, as if the purchase in the clutter-free Paris shop evoked a thought. ''It's not easy to go to these shows and curate and pick out the right things. It's actually very hard.''
But Perry is a very involved owner, visiting the store four or five times a week. He pushed to give Freds, a popular lunch spot, a locavore twist at night to draw a bigger crowd. This past summer he organized a two-day ''odyssey'' to California, so that he, Lee and Vitale could learn the latest e-commerce technology. (The company's Web site had been neglected for years, but after a revamp this past May, traffic is up 34 percent, and Lee says that Barneys.com will soon overtake the Beverly Hills store as the second-largest revenue producer after Madison Avenue.) Lee called Perry ''a worthy owner-patron of Barneys,'' and said: ''It would be much harder if someone said, 'We should put sneakers on the ground floor because we could sell a lot of Keds.' That would be a problem.''
When I asked Perry whom he trusts for information about the industry, he identified Lee, Vitale and his wife. He's certainly loyal. Lee and Vitale, another Gucci alumna, are both well regarded, but I wondered how he could be so sure his managers were as good as he thinks they are. He said he had hired a top consultant to evaluate them. ''Barneys has the highest expert score of any company he's looked at,'' Perry said in earnest. ''He told me he had never seen scores like this.'' But scores can't account for instinct. Lee and Vitale missed the boat on one of the most anticipated lines of the year: Raf Simons's debut collection for Dior. Simons, a 44-year-old Belgian, had attracted notice for his modern tailoring and colors at Jil Sander, and insiders knew he had the maturity to take over a big French house. The head of another New York store told me, ''We knew this was going to be big.'' Lee explained in an e-mail in late October that Barneys has tended to focus on smaller European companies, like Lanvin and Givenchy, rather than the goliaths like Dior. But when I saw the Barneys team at the Paris ready-to-wear shows in September, they were champing to get Simons's collection. Bergdorf's and Saks will have it instead.
Perry's arrival poses an even more fundamental question: What are stores for today? He takes ownership at a critical time for luxury retail, when stores are trying to figure out the relationship between e-commerce and bricks-and-mortar locations, and customers seem to bounce back and forth between wanting to price-hunt designer brands online and wanting to have the singular experience that a well-run store can provide. But Perry seems interested in the challenge. ''The reason I didn't want to sell it,'' he said, ''is that in all aspects of where retailing is headed in the future -- Barneys is there. It has the in-store experience, Freds, the new shoe floor, everyone, men and women, trying on shoes together, the furniture is cool.'' He believes that Barneys can be a $1 billion business, with the Web as the key driver. ''In terms of the future of where e-commerce is going,'' he told me in November, ''I don't think anyone's started yet.''
It stands to reason that in the post-recession, post-postmodern era, when a lot of consumers just want what they want -- without irony, without attitude, without too many barriers -- that Barneys is once again reflecting the city. More and more of the shoppers you see on Madison Avenue or in the department stores are tourists. And maybe to appeal to them, Barneys must be a little less quirky and provocative and local, and more of an accessible global brand with a glossy emporium. At least that seems to be the thinking of the current management. And there are some indications that this approach is starting to pay off: company revenues in the most recent fiscal year were over $750 million, and Lee says that earnings are in line to return shortly to historic 2007 levels (which other sources put at $77 million before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). The Madison Avenue store now carries 1,800 different units of leather accessories (though not all displayed at once), a number that, as Lee said, reflects today's reality: ''Every inch counts.'' Annual sales of those accessories have doubled to nearly $8,000 per square foot -- another sign that Lee is giving consumers what they want.
But Barneys has never been about giving customers what they want. It has been about educating, expanding horizons, presenting the unexpected. ''If you give your customers what they want, then you die,'' Gene said. ''The fact is they don't know what they want.'' Finding out what they want is one reason people still go to stores. One doesn't search Amazon for ideas and inspiration.
Of all the ideas I heard in the course of my reporting, only Gene's notion of open windows tingled with 21st-century possibility. It was one of those gateway ideas that immediately set off other thoughts: If Barneys had windows that allowed you to look right into the store, what new form would the interior take? What kinds of merchandise would be offered, and how? Would the stale trappings of luxury be stripped away? Would the stage be set for a new kind of experience? Beyond products and windows, that is what a store is for.
He may not be a retail savant like Gene Pressman, but Perry is a quick study. One day in July we were talking about the Paris haute couture shows, and Simons's debut at Dior, when he said: ''I thought it was great. I talked to Mark yesterday, and I didn't get the feeling he was blown away by it. I looked at the dresses that Raf chose, and it seemed that it was right in line with what he should have done for his first collection.'' My ears perked up: So Perry was aiming high. Was that instinct? A few days later, I spoke to the chief of another New York store, who said: ''Barneys should be thinking of a big French brand that can go up against Chanel. Why not? There's an opportunity there.''
Richard Perry, hedge-fund manager, might just be a retailer yet.

HIGHLIGHT: Ignorance and ideology, part LXXXX. 

 BODY:
Menzie Chinn is having a dialogue, or something, with the Heritage Foundation. He pointed out that their arguments against stimulus, aside from being primitive and wrong, would also imply that the fiscal cliff is harmless. They respond in part by claiming that all they're worried about is the incentive effects -- yeah, right -- and also by claiming that famous economists made the same arguments. 
The latter claim, unfortunately, is completely true. But it doesn't absolve Heritage; all it shows is that much of macroeconomics, especially but not only at Chicago, has retrogressed intellectually, to such an extent that famous economists repeat 1930-vintage fallacies in perfect ignorance of the hard intellectual work that showed, three generations ago, that they are indeed fallacies. 
By the way, Heritage -- after totally misrepresenting Keynesian economics (Keynesians never think about investment? Really?) -- asks,
When the government borrows a trillion dollars on global financial markets for a stimulus package, does Chinn believe that zero dollars of that is diverted from investment?
I don't know for sure what Menzie's answer would be, but mine is, no, I don't believe that zero dollars are diverted; under current conditions, negative dollars are diverted. That is, stimulus spending would lead to more, not less, private investment. Why? Because we are in a liquidity trap -- interest rates won't rise -- and higher sales would induce businesses to invest more, not less.
Oh, and if you go back to what Heritage analysts were writing back in 2009, they were predicting that government borrowing would lead to soaring interest rates. How's that going, guys?
Meanwhile, Brad DeLong points out that Heritage has company, not just in its intellectual degradation, but in its duplicity:
Four years ago there were quite a number of economists of reputation and thought to be of note who stridently and aggressively argued that the increases in federal spending in the Recovery Act would not boost employment and production ...
If extra federal spending and reduced tax collections in the Recovery Act could not boost production and employment, the reduced federal spending and increased tax collections from going over the fiscal cliff cannot reduce production and employment and does not risk sending the American economy into renewed recession.
Yet not a one--not a single one--of the economists who were so strident in their condemnations of the ineffectiveness of the Recovery Act is out there now saying that the fiscal cliff is not of concern. None of them. Zero. Nada. Shunya. Sifr.
Which prompts Cosma Shalizi to write in comments,
... our gracious host would really _like_ to be just a little bit to the left of a technocratic center, and to debate those just a little bit to his right about optimal policies within a shared objective function, and pretending that it is a technical and not a political discussion. But because [stuff I can't put in the Grey Lady] and because everyone at all on the right has spent forty years (at least) doing their damndest to _make sure_ [more stuff], even the smallest gesture in that direction is not so much reconciliation as collaboration. And so our host has sads. (So, for that matter, did Uncle Paul, before he learned to relish their hatred.) The realization that this applies to economists --- that much of the discipline is not a branch of science or even of dialectic, but merely of rhetoric (and not in an inspirational, D. McCloskey way either) --- cannot come too soon. 
I wish I had an easy refutation.

HEADLINE: Fleeing Taxes and 'Insult,' Gérard Depardieu Says Au Revoir, La France

BYLINE: SCOTT SAYARE


HIGHLIGHT: In a public drama hardly imaginable anywhere other than France, the prime minister calls one of the most country's greatest celebrities "pathetic" and the actor fires back, "I am surrendering my passport." 

 BODY:
PARIS - The actor Gérard Depardieu, who was best known until recently as a pillar of French cinema with an occasionally embarrassing tendency to over-imbibe, this week made an ignominious name for himself as a tax evader, drawing the ire of the government, the news media and a good number of his fellow French citizens. 
Fellow French citizens for now, at least. 
Mr. Depardieu has taken up residence in the Belgian town of Néchin, just over the French border but somewhat farther from France with regards to fiscal policy: the maximum marginal income tax rate is not 75 percent in Belgium, as it now is in France, and there is no wealth tax.
France's prime minister, the Socialist Jean-Marc Ayrault, has called Mr. Depardieu's departure unpatriotic and "pathetic" at a time of economic belt-tightening. The assessments of most politicians and commentators have been the same, if somewhat less harsh.
On Sunday, in an angry open letter to Mr. Ayrault, Mr. Depardieu said that he would renounce his French citizenship and that he was moving to Belgium not solely for tax reasons but because he felt the government believed that "success, creation, talent - difference, in fact - must be punished."
"I am neither to be pitied nor to be praised, but I refuse the word 'pathetic,'" he wrote in his letter, published in the newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche, noting that he had paid an 85 percent tax rate on his income this year and (EURO)145 million, or more than $190 million, over 45 years.
He also noted - correctly - that a number of other French celebrities have long been based outside France for tax reasons, but that not all of them have come in for such approbation from the government or news media. And he rejected the notion that patriotism would require him to submit to whatever fiscal regime the government might cook up.
"We don't have the same homeland anymore," he wrote in his open letter to Mr. Ayrault. "I am a true European, a citizen of the world, as my father always taught me."
Rendezvous wrote last week about increasing efforts to find and tax billions of dollars earned by individuals and companies.

HEADLINE: Do Lower Taxes Create Jobs? Look at Clinton and Bush.

BYLINE: ALBERT R. HUNT


HIGHLIGHT: For Republican supply-siders, denying that marginal tax rates are the sole way to induce or impede economic growth is equivalent to apostasy. History tells a different story. 

 BODY:
For Republican supply-siders, denying that marginal tax rates are the sole way to induce or impede economic growth is equivalent to apostasy.
In the 1980s, under President Ronald Reagan, the supply-side tax cutters were in their element. As the debate over marginal tax rates rages anew - President Barack Obama wants to raise the top rate to 39.6 percent from 35 percent - the records of the incumbent president's two predecessors give supply-siders political heartburn. 
As I write in my latest Letter From Washington, "As many Republicans reject higher tax rates for wealthier Americans, Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, urges them to continue to resist, claiming that the economic boom of the 1990s and the resulting budget surplus were due to his leadership in Congress and not to President Bill Clinton's early tax increases." 
Bill Clinton raised marginal tax rates in 1993. Over the next few years and beyond, economic growth flourished, unemployment plummeted and the budget picture brightened. 
In 2001 and 2003, President George W. Bush cut marginal tax rates. Over the next few years and beyond, the economy stagnated, unemployment rose and the deficit ballooned.
 Clearly, there were other important factors than taxes: the technology boom of the 1990s benefited Mr. Clinton; terrorism and wars hindered Mr. Bush.
 Both sides know that isn't a sufficient explanation. Daniel Mitchell, of the Cato Institute, asserts that Mr. Clinton's record of surpluses was a result of spending restraint. There are numbers to support that; it's also true that federal revenue increased 37 percent in the four years after the 1993 tax increase.
 The 2012 Republican vice-presidential nominee, Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, insists that the Clinton and Bush comparison on taxes is unfair. Mr. Clinton, he argues, had the tech boom and the peace dividend resulting from the end of the Cold War; Mr. Bush had to cope with the end of the technology bubble, terrorism, a couple wars and the financial crisis.
 The crisis didn't occur until the end of Bush's administration and he chose to wage those wars.

HEADLINE: Tongue in Cheek, Aiming at a Sweet Tooth

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
ACCORDING to the Mayan calendar, at least as some have jokingly interpreted it, the world may end on Dec. 21, but before then the Jell-O brand is introducing a tongue-in-cheek commercial about its own effort to avert the apocalypse.
A commercial that will be introduced on Monday opens with a male voice-over explaining that the ancient Mayans made offerings to their gods of beans, corn and potatoes, all of which he calls boring. 
''No wonder,'' he says, ''the gods decided to end the world.''
In the commercial an actor depicting a Jell-O executive in a khaki safari outfit is led through the jungle by guides. Some guides carry a large wooden crate, an offering, promises the voice-over, ''that would finally appease the gods.''
When they reach a Mayan temple, they pry the lid off the crate to reveal that it is filled with cups of chocolate pudding.
''Jell-O pudding -- the funnest sacrifice ever,'' says the voice-over as the men stack the pudding into the form of a pyramid. ''Fingers crossed, we'll see you on the 22nd.''
The commercial closes with the slogan Jell-O is introducing with the campaign: ''Fun things up.''
The commercial, by Crispin Porter & Bogusky, of Boulder, Colo., part of MDC Partners, will run widely on television and online through Dec. 21.
On Dec. 22, Jell-O will introduce a second commercial that concludes the premise, and which will run only through Dec. 23. The brand declined to reveal the content of the second spot publicly for the sake of suspense.
Jell-O, which would not disclose the cost of the campaign, spent $37.4 million on advertising in 2011, down from $69.5 million in 2010, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP.
Jell-O, which began as a gelatin-only brand, has been marketed increasingly as a treat for children. Memorable campaigns with Bill Cosby as spokesman introduced in the 1970s and spanning more than 25 years, for example, featured the comedian interacting with young children.
The strategy historically has been to induce ''mom to buy the product for her kids, but then she and dad ate it as well,'' said Dan O'Leary, senior director for marketing for Jell-O, a Kraft Foods brand.
That shifted around 2002, when, during the Atkins diet craze, Jell-O pudding, especially the sugar-free varieties, was marketed primarily to adults as a low-carb, high-protein treat. Consumption patterns changed, with ''mom buying it for herself, but the kids not eating it as much,'' Mr. O'Leary said.
Now, instead of pinpointing either children or adults, Jell-O is pitching the products as ''desserts the whole family loves,'' Mr. O'Leary said.
These days Jell-O, particularly the gelatin variety, has a ''bad rap,'' writes Victoria Belanger in ''Hello, Jell-O,'' a recipe book published in February that takes an unexpected gourmet approach, with recipes for molds like eggnog rum, sparkling Champagne and strawberries and watermelon basil agar.
''What people mostly think of when they think of Jell-O is cafeterias and hospital food,'' Ms. Belanger, who publishes a blog, The Jello Mold Mistress of Brooklyn, said in an interview. Or, she added, ''they think of Jell-O shots,'' referring to the potent concoctions popular in college bars.
''It's not thought of as being very classy, and it's not that I think it's super classy, but I've at least tried to elevate it,'' said Ms. Belanger of gelatin desserts. ''I still haven't broken the cupcake barrier, but that's a high bar to set.''
Pearle B. Wait, a carpenter in Le Roy, N.Y., created Jell-O in 1897, and it wasn't long before the brand became as synonymous with gelatin desserts as Kleenex is with facial tissues and Q-Tips with cotton swabs.
Today, Kraft, which also owns the Knox unflavored gelatin brand, commands a 79.5 percent share of the market for gelatin dessert mixes, an 82.3 percent share for pudding, mousse and pie filling mixes, and a 56.2 percent share for refrigerated pudding, mousse, gelatin and parfaits, according to data for the 52 weeks ending Nov. 4 from SymphonyIRI Group, a market research firm.
According to Jell-O, sales of pudding products account for about 60 percent of revenue and gelatin products for 40 percent; ready-to-eat products in the dairy case account for about 55 percent of revenue, shelf-stable mixes for 45 percent.
To help update the brand, in September Kraft introduced Jell-O with Mix-Ins, which have a second container of dry ingredients fitted atop pudding cups. Intended to appeal to multigenerational palates, the varieties have associations to other desserts, including German chocolate cake, banana caramel pie and strawberry shortcake.
Newer recipes, meanwhile, try to increase what food marketers call usage occasions by including the powder mixes in dishes whose final form is neither pudding nor gelatin.
Recipes highlighted on the Jell-O Facebook page recently, for example, include a snack mix made with popcorn, pretzel twists, nuts and a glaze made with the brand's black cherry gelatin. Another recipe for a blended coffee drink combines instant coffee, milk and vanilla pudding.
''We feel like the way to make both gelatin and pudding newsworthy and contemporary is by treating them more like ingredients,'' said Mr. O'Leary, the brand manager.
As for the new advertising, Tony Calcao, an executive creative director at Crispin Porter & Bogusky, said the whimsical approach toward the Mayan calendar was meant to demonstrate the new tagline, ''Fun things up.''
Jell-O carefully eschewed typical advertising assertions about the product being toothsome and wholesome, which Mr. Calcao said he appreciated.
''They could have asked to force in some health benefit or taste message about the pudding being made with real milk or containing no high fructose corn syrup, but they didn't,'' he said. ''There's no bite-and-smile in the work, and that's good.''

HEADLINE: Economic Forecast Is Sunnier, but Washington Casts a Big Shadow

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
The American economy could finally have a pretty good year next year -- assuming Washington does its part.
Economists see a number of sources of underlying strength in the economy, but for the growth to gain traction, they say, political leaders need to avoid the broad tax increases and spending cuts now being debated.
The nascent housing rebound, the natural gas boom, record profit margins, a friendlier credit market for small businesses, along with pent-up demand for autos and other big purchases, could in combination unleash growth and hiring that the economy needs. 
''Underneath all the shenanigans in Washington, there's a lot of strengthening,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics.
More robust growth next year -- perhaps higher than 3 percent later in the year, according to some of the more optimistic forecasts -- would certainly be a stark reversal from the current sluggish path.
There is a range of opinion among economists, though, and some warn of continued sluggishness, especially in the beginning of the year.
Estimates for the last quarter of 2012 are hovering around an unusually weak 1 percent annualized rate.
That dismal pace is driven partly by drags from Europe's recession and China's slowdown; partly by companies readjusting after potentially overstocking their back-room shelves in the third quarter; and largely by worries about the so-called fiscal cliff of spending cuts and tax increases set for early 2013.
Surveys of consumer and business confidence in recent weeks have plummeted to recession-era lows. With such uncertainty, businesses have also recently curtailed spending on capital investments like computers, delivery trucks and other equipment, apparently in anticipation of higher tax rates and the destructive side effects of government cutbacks. Given that capital expenditures have been weak recently, some economists believe businesses will start spending more if Congress ends or at least delays the risk of severe fiscal tightening.
''You would think there must be for most businesses a list of projects they'd like to do which they've just been pushing a little bit into the future because they haven't been able to justify taking the risk because they don't know what's around the corner,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight. ''When they know more about the future, and what tax rates they'll be paying, they will be able to dust off those plans and finally execute them.''
Improving access to credit helps these capital expenditures become not only more attractive, but also more accessible. Commercial and industrial loans have been rising in recent months, according to the Federal Reserve. The National Federation of Independent Business has also reported that the share of small business owners who say their credit needs are not being met has been falling.
Additionally, corporate profits reached a high, even adjusting for inflation, in the third quarter. Companies have amassed a lot of cash that they can use to buy equipment or hire people if they feel secure enough about the recovery.
Consumers, on the other hand, are still not exactly cash-rich, particularly since their disposable income has been flat to falling in recent months. But in the last few years they have deleveraged greatly -- either by paying down debt or having it written off through default -- and, more important, they are feeling a little wealthier because the housing market appears to have bottomed out. The country has finally worked its way through the excess housing inventory from the bubble years, and now housing prices and housing construction are rising.
Household formation is picking up: young people are finally moving into their own homes, as are other Americans who had lived with family or friends.
''We're slowly but steadily improving, with more job opportunities in particular for younger households,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ''They can only live with their parents for so long. There are powerful centrifugal forces in those households, on both sides. As soon as they have a chance to get out, many will take it.''
Demographic data suggests that there should be about a million more households headed by younger Americans today than there actually are. That bodes well for continued formation of households next year, and new household formation is typically accompanied by other spending like furniture and kitchenware. Under normal circumstances, each new household adds about $145,000 to output that year as the spending ripples through the economy, Mr. Zandi says.
As is the case with businesses, economists see consumers unleashing some of their pent-up demand for cars. The average age of all vehicles in operation in America is at a record high of 11.2 years, according to the research firm R. L. Polk, which tracks vehicle sales and registrations. Vehicle sales have already been posting large gains this year.
The major caveat to all these relatively upbeat indicators, of course, is that Congress might override all this strength with deep austerity measures.
Even without all of the federal tax increases and spending cuts scheduled for 2013, the government sector will slow growth because state and local governments are still shrinking, said Michael Feroli, chief United States economist for JPMorgan Chase. The sharp fiscal tightening at the federal level under current law would not only drag on growth but throw the entire economy back into recession, according to numerous private and government forecasters.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the entirety of the so-called fiscal cliff would shave about three percentage points off gross domestic product growth next year.
A more modest tightening along the lines of what President Obama wants -- which would include extending most existing tax rates and spending programs -- would still substantially reduce growth, analysts say. Charles Dumas, the chairman of Lombard Street Research, forecasts about a two percentage point subtraction from output growth next year under a situation where most of the Bush tax cuts are kept, the payroll tax holiday is phased out and most of the scheduled spending cuts are eliminated.
''The full drag posed by the cliff is sufficient to erase roughly two and a half years' worth of economic gains,'' said Joseph A. LaVorgna, chief United States economist at Deutsche Bank.

HEADLINE: Speaker's Overture on Taxes Raises Hope for Fiscal Deal

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN and JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Speaker John A. Boehner's latest offer to President Obama to allow tax rates to rise on incomes over $1 million has already changed the terms of negotiations to avert a fiscal crisis in January, and both sides on Sunday expressed new optimism that a deal could be reached this week.
In a phone call with Mr. Obama on Friday, the speaker, who had resolutely opposed allowing income tax rates to rise on anyone, instead spoke in terms of preventing taxes from rising on everyone with a yearly income below $1 million. He also said he could accept an agreement that would raise $1 trillion in new revenues over 10 years, up from $800 billion, if the president committed to significant savings from benefit programs like Medicare, according to people familiar with the talks. 
Also, in a big concession, Mr. Boehner offered to extend the debt limit for a year rather than withhold Republican support for an increase to once again use the need to raise the nation's borrowing limit as leverage to force Mr. Obama's acceptance of additional spending cuts in coming months. Mr. Obama has lowered his revenue demand from $1.6 trillion over 10 years to $1.4 trillion, and some Democrats have said his bottom line is $1.2 trillion. Even so, administration officials characterized the speaker's overture as a sign of progress.
With Friday's exchange, the president and the speaker put aside their philosophical argument over whether higher tax rates would hurt "small businesses" and "job creators" and began wrangling only over price. While Republicans with knowledge of the talks said a deal was not imminent, they indicated that it was close. "We are hopeful," one of the officials familiar with the talks said Sunday.
No deal is certain. The parties are far apart on possible changes to benefit programs, especially Medicare, and new tax revenues that must be locked in right away through higher tax rates rather than later through an uncertain tax reform effort. Democrats were hostile on Sunday.
"The reported offer by Speaker Boehner on tax rates would lose almost three-quarters of the revenue that could be gained by ending the Bush tax cuts for households with incomes over $250,000," said Representative Sander M. Levin of Michigan, the ranking Democrat on the House Ways and Means Committee. And that number does matter. The president and the speaker are $400 billion apart on the amount their proposals would instruct Congress's tax-writing committees to raise when the hard work of overhauling the tax code begins next year.
The sides are further apart on the amount of spending that should be cut. The White House has said it wants the relevant Congressional committees to find $400 billion in savings from federal health care programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Mr. Obama's health care law over 10 years, and about $200 billion in other cuts. Republicans want $600 billion in savings from health care programs over 10 years and $600 billion in other cuts, none of them detailed yet.
The officials familiar with the talks said this weekend that Mr. Boehner wants Mr. Obama to agree to move the government to a different way of calculating inflation that would slow the growth rate of many government programs, chiefly Social Security, by slightly lowering cost-of-living adjustments. It would also raise additional revenues because tax brackets, which rise each year with inflation, would rise more slowly. Rising incomes would more quickly push people into higher tax brackets.
But the officials said that Mr. Boehner was willing to drop discussions of an immediate increase in the eligibility age for Medicare, to 67 from 65, recognizing the fierce opposition to that change among Democrats.
Mr. Boehner crafted his proposal on tax rates as a counterargument to a growing number of Republicans who have publicly said that the party should quickly pass legislation to extend expiring tax rates for incomes below $250,000. Advocates of that position said it would keep taxes from going up on Jan. 1 for 98 percent of households.
But Mr. Boehner argued that the proposal, still being pushed by Mr. Obama, would allow the top two income tax rates to increase to 39.6 percent and 36 percent, from 35 percent and 33 percent, to capture people who could arguably call themselves upper middle class. By pressing for a limit of $1 million of income, only the top rate and a handful of the superrich would be affected, and virtually no legitimate small businesses would feel the hit.
The president's plan, which also would include higher tax rates on capital gains, dividends and inherited estates, would raise $960 billion over 10 years. Congressional tax experts estimated on Sunday that a 39.6 percent rate on incomes over $1 million would raise $269.3 billion over 10 years. If limits on tax deductions and credits for high-income families that were repealed in the 2001 tax cut are allowed to return, that figure would top $300 billion.
The officials said that would be enough to justify canceling spending cuts that are set to take effect on Jan. 2 and would allow Congress to start on a tax-code overhaul that would create a new set of tax rates, possibly beginning in 2014. Closing loopholes and curtailing deductions and credits would raise most of the $1 trillion in revenues Mr. Boehner has offered, they say.
But Republicans have yet to show how tax writers can get from $300 billion in revenues through one higher tax rate to $1 trillion, and many tax experts have said it could be impossible without cutting back tax breaks for the middle class as well as for those with high incomes.
Politically, however, even Mr. Boehner's modest play on higher rates carries a significant risk in a House Republican conference in which most lawmakers have vowed to never raise taxes. One Republican House member, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he did not want to undermine the speaker's bargaining position, called Mr. Obama's resolute demand for higher tax rates "a brilliant play to start a Republican civil war."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Smaller U.S. Colleges Try to Crack Chinese Market

BYLINE: By LARA FARRAR

 BODY:
BEIJING -- One factor that made it easier for Samford University to catch the attention of some of the thousands of Chinese students at a recent education expo was that many mistook it for a university with a similar name: Stanford.
''It's a good conversation starter,'' said Hunter Denson, an international admissions counselor for Samford, a Baptist college near Birmingham, Alabama. ''They mix up the name all of the time. When we first got here, that was all they cared about. 'Are you an Ivy League? Are you in the top 10? Why is your mascot not the Stanford tree?'''
The China Education Expo, which began its tour in Beijing in October and continued on to six other cities through November, was Mr. Denson's third trip to China. He first visited about a year ago after Samford decided that it needed more international students. So far, the college has accepted about 100 Chinese students and is also recruiting in South America. 
''We are kind of new on the scene,'' Mr. Denson said. ''There are a lot of schools going to recruit internationally for the first time. Many of them are looking at emerging economies. But the thing about China is there are a lot of students, and China has had a lot of economic success lately.''
China is a hot market for U.S. institutions looking for international students.
This fall, American colleges recruited at a fair in Nanjing held by the EIC Group, a Chinese education agency, and one in Shanghai held by the Institute of International Education, a nonprofit group based in New York.
''This is becoming kind of big business,'' said Peggy Blumenthal, senior counselor to the president at the Institute of International Education. ''With the economic downturn in the U.S., schools are more eager to have international students at the undergrad level who are full fee-paying students.''
Among newer entrants are small-town Christian and community colleges that focus on students who may not make it to top universities.
Admissions officers from some smaller colleges say they are interested in China partly because they want more globalized campuses, but also because they can find students to pay full tuition.
Annual tuition for international students at Samford is $24,570, not including housing. At the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor, a Baptist college in Belton, Texas, it is $17,520 per year. Green River Community College, outside Seattle, charges $9,600 per semester; local students pay $3,522 for the same number of credits.
The challenge these schools face while recruiting in China is that Samford is, well, not Stanford.
To compensate, most offer programs to help students with language skills before they enter undergraduate classes. They also emphasize, particularly to nervous Chinese parents, their pastoral care.
Elizabeth Tanaka, the director of international recruitment for the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor, said Chinese parents perceived American faith-based schools as a ''security blanket'' for their children overseas.
''We tell them we don't have alcohol on our campus -- obviously there are no drugs,'' she said. ''People try to be a little bit nicer, treat people the way they would want to be treated.''
Undergraduates are required to take Bible classes and attend church.
''But they look at it as, 'Hey, this is part of American culture. Even if I am not interested in Christianity, this is what America is about,''' Ms. Tanaka said.
Since Mary Hardin-Baylor began recruiting in China in 2008, about 250 Chinese students have enrolled. Ms. Tanaka said another selling point was the college's hands-on treatment. Staff members pick students up from the airport, prepare bedding for them when they arrive, take them to the doctor and stay in touch with parents back home.
''It's like having a bunch of 10-year-olds,'' said Ms. Tanaka, who also attended the Beijing education expo. ''Sometimes I have to sit down with the students and say, 'You have to grow up. You have to go to class. You will fail if you don't do anything.'''
Harding University in Searcy, Arkansas, which has ties to the Churches of Christ, has been recruiting in China for a decade. It has enrolled more than 400 Chinese students and built partnerships with at least 10 Chinese universities. Harding has a Chinese-language Web site and is considering opening a campus in China.
In the late 1990s, a local government in China financed graduate study there for 16 students.
''One reason they choose Harding is the simple idea of safety and security,'' said Jim Carr, the college's executive vice president. ''We have had people from China tell us that there is a crisis of character in China and that they want students at a school like Harding.''
Bible classes and chapel attendance are mandatory, and there is a strict dress code. Some activities, like swimming, are separated by sex.
''You can go to our Web site pretty easily and see what kind of school Harding is,'' Mr. Carr said. ''If they can read English at all, they will know Harding is a faith-based institution.''
Liu Chang, a Shanghai native who is now a sophomore at Samford University, said he had chosen the college because it was Christian. At the same time, he said, he felt that Samford was ''sort of letting anyone in, even if they are not good enough,'' and added that Chinese students were not fully aware of the mandatory religious curriculum.
''Some students came here and said, 'What? I did not know we had to do this,''' said Mr. Liu, 22. ''For Chinese students, they have no idea what that is before they come here. Some end up transferring.''
The possibility of moving to another institution, perhaps a better-known one, is a selling point. This is particularly true of community colleges, which are two-year government-financed institutions that can be used as a steppingstone to four-year universities.
Norma Kent, senior vice president for communications for the American Association of Community Colleges, said domestic financial constraints were leading to increased recruitment overseas.
In the 2010-11 academic year, nearly 90,000 international students studied at U.S. community colleges, according to the Institute of International of Education.
Green River Community College, which has an English-language program for foreign students, began recruiting in China in 1994. It enrolled more than 1,500 international students for its fall semester, more than 500 of whom are Chinese. It grossed $15 million in tuition from its international student population in the 2011-2012 academic year.
Green River emphasizes the number of students it helps transfer to institutions like the University of Washington or the University of California, Berkeley.
''To be honest, recruitment works better in second- and third-tier cities,'' Ross Jennings, a recruiter for Green River, said on a recruiting trip to China. ''We can't compete with the big-name universities, and the top schools in Beijing or Shanghai are looking for brand names,'' he said of elite high schools.
China remains a difficult market for lesser-known schools. Turnout at the fairs in Shanghai and Nanjing, both of which featured a number of community colleges, was lackluster.
The Institute of International Education, which held the Shanghai fair, declined to provide attendance figures, as did EIC Group, which organized the fair in Nanjing.
''Shanghai was not a good turnout, which was kind of surprising because the Chinese market is so huge,'' said Christina M. Delgado, the international education program director at College of the Desert, a community college in Palm Desert, California.
At the Nanjing event, which billed itself as an education fair ''for ordinary people,'' some students expressed skepticism.
''I heard community colleges can't give real degrees. Is it true?'' said Zhang Tianhao, a student from Nanjing hoping to study in the United States. ''I want to go to a famous school.''
''It is not easy,'' said Scott Han, the assistant director of international marketing at Cascadia Community College in Bothell, Washington, who attended the expo in Beijing. ''The parents and students just block their ears and walk away. They really don't understand that we are just trying to give the less-qualified students a chance to study in the U.S.''

HEADLINE: E.U. Plan to Speed Up Broadband Could Also Raise Phone Rates

BYLINE: By KEVIN J. O'BRIEN

 BODY:
BERLIN -- When the authorities have tinkered with European telecommunications rules, it has usually been to lower prices for consumers, whether through retail price controls on mobile roaming fees or mandatory cuts in regulated interconnection charges.
But this year, to encourage more investment in high-speed broadband networks, regulators are considering helping the biggest operators increase a main source of income: the rent they receive from rivals that lease their landline grids.
The architect of the plan, Neelie Kroes, the European Union's digital agenda commissioner, has pitched the increases as part of a broader package to stimulate spending while preserving competition and consumer choice.
The plan, however, has alarmed operators that would have to pay the higher charges, like the British mobile operator Vodafone. Vittorio Colao, chief executive of Vodafone, said that the plan to increase the fees collected by former monopolies, including BT, Deutsche Telekom, France Télécom, KPN, Telecom Italia and Telefónica, could lead to a ''re-monopolization'' of the business. 
Mr. Colao said he was worried that landline operators would use the additional revenue to lower their own prices and try to squeeze competitors like Vodafone.
''Increasing the incentive to invest is a good thing,'' Mr. Colao said. But now Ms. Kroes must ''demonstrate that these new criteria won't contaminate the competitive arena in Europe,'' he said.
Under the plan, the European Commission, the executive arm of the European Union, would begin regulating the fees that mobile operators routinely pay to lease the grids of landline operators.
In much of the world, running telecommunications lines to homes and businesses has traditionally been the domain of a local monopoly, or sometimes a duopoly in the case of telephones and cable television in the United States. Until 1998, countries in the European Union were allowed to maintain national monopolies for this ''local loop'' to the consumer.
With deregulation, however, the former monopolies were required to unbundle the cost of the local loop and offer it to competitors, thus allowing companies like Vodafone to enter the market.
Despite 14 years of deregulation, and the addition of more than 100 mobile operators in Europe, the former monopolies still supply the majority of fixed-line services in their home countries. In Spain, Telefónica has more than 70 percent of this business.
Until now, these unbundling rates have been set by national regulators, and the average monthly cost per customer in the European Union stands at &#x20ac;8.62, or $11.35. The fee typically makes up a third or more of monthly landline phone bills in Europe and also influences wireless prices because it affects mobile operator costs. The fee ranges from &#x20ac;4.20 in Slovakia to &#x20ac;12.41 in Ireland.
Mrs. Kroes proposed to lower, not raise, unbundling fees in September 2011, to make the old landline networks less profitable for big operators and to encourage them to invest in new networks. But the former monopolies protested, and after personal appeals from executives at big operators, in some cases accompanied by their investors, she reversed course.
Ms. Kroes is proposing that each country within the European Union be required to set its fee within the range of &#x20ac;8 to &#x20ac;10 per month, according to a copy of her proposal obtained by the International Herald Tribune. The new range would most likely require 10 E.U. countries where the fee is currently below this range to raise it, in some cases only slightly, and in others, sharply.
The increases would in all likelihood be passed on to consumers. The rise in fees could be greatest in Eastern Europe, where regulators have been most aggressive in setting low leasing rates to encourage competition. The level of leasing charges could double in Estonia, Latvia, Poland and Slovakia.
Mr. Colao, the Vodafone chief executive, said Ms. Kroes needed to tighten the legal safeguards in her plan to prevent big operators from exploiting access to landline networks.
The current safeguards in the proposal, a margin-squeeze test and a test that measures whether former monopolies are discriminating against rivals by offering less attractive leasing terms for using the local loop, are insufficient and need to be strengthened, he said.
''We need to be very vigilant to preserve competition in the market,'' Mr. Colao said.
Those changes may already be in the works.
On Tuesday, Ms. Kroes plans to announce a set of stronger measures to bar discriminatory behavior by landline operators as part of a comprehensive package of proposed regulations intended to increase broadband investment.
The full European Commission is expected to vote on the proposal in February. The package would include legal mechanisms to reduce the cost of civil engineering associated with broadband network construction, as well as a new methodology that national regulators can use to calculate the cost of wholesale access for rival mobile operators.
Ms. Kroes will also present a draft recommendation on ensuring that network operators treat all content providers equally in the age of mobile computing, and new safeguards to make sure that universal service obligations are not neglected as alternative computer-based communications networks spread.
The priority is to create a stable environment for investing in broadband networks, which has been lagging amid the economic downturn. The slowdown is threatening the European Commission's goal of building a high-speed broadband infrastructure by 2020.
Only 2 percent of the households in the European Union have access to broadband download speeds of 100 megabits per second or greater. In the United States, by comparison, at least 50 million homes, or nearly half, are connected to networks with speeds of at least 100 megabits per second. By 2020, the commission's goal is for half of E.U. households to have access to this service. Meanwhile, only half of E.U. households have service at 30 megabits per second. By 2020, the commission wants all E.U. households to have this as an option.
''Fast connections cannot be a luxury for the urban few,'' Ms. Kroes said in a statement. ''I am ready to take on vested interests and 'business as usual' to make sure everyone gets connected. All in all, we are offering a balanced package.''
Smaller mobile operators, especially those in Eastern Europe that face potentially steep increases in leasing costs, are lobbying against the uniform pricing guidelines.
Miroslaw Godlewski, the chief executive of Netia, an operator based in Warsaw, said increases in unbundling costs would raise the cost of phone service in Poland beyond what many consumers could afford.
''This would be bad news for consumers and competition in Central and Eastern European countries with relatively low average monthly revenue per user and relative low salary levels,'' Mr. Godlewski said.
But Hannes Wittig, an analyst in London at J.P. Morgan Cazenove, said Ms. Kroes's plan would achieve its goal of increasing investment in new networks by giving the biggest operators roughly 6 percent more sales revenue and 11 percent more pretax income.
In a note to investors, Mr. Wittig said that Ms. Kroes's decision to raise unbundling rates was a ''paradigm change'' in European regulation of the sector, which in recent years has been marked by ever tighter control of prices, even down to the retail level.
Mr. Wittig said that Deutsche Telecom, BT, Telefónica, Telecom Italia and TDC in Denmark would be most likely to invest more in fast networks with the extra revenue.

HEADLINE: U.S. Women Circumspect on Latest Soccer League

BYLINE: By MIKE BERARDINO

 BODY:
BOCA RATON, Fla. -- Moments after her team completed a 10-city exhibition tour with a 4-1 victory over China, United States midfielder Megan Rapinoe fielded a question Saturday night about the latest attempt to start a women's professional soccer league in this country.
''What is the name of the league?'' Rapinoe asked amid the postgame din of a still-screaming crowd of 10,493 at a football stadium on the campus of Florida Atlantic University.
The National Women's Soccer League, Rapinoe was told, the stylish playmaker having been too busy to catch the official announcement at halftime. The eight-team league is scheduled to begin play in the spring of 2013. 
Rapinoe, whose first-half blast from 40 yards helped the Olympic champion women's team finish the year 28-3-1, nodded and acknowledged that it was just the most basic of many questions she and her other high-profile teammates had about the start-up venture.
''There's a lot we don't know so far, so it's hard to say what we expect out of it,'' Rapinoe said. ''I think having a league and having an opportunity to play consistently, if it's sustainable and it's something that's good for not only this team but the next 100 players, would be good. We need to know a lot more.''
Two previous American-based women's leagues have failed over the past decade, so there is understandable wariness on the highly popular women's team, which has captivated many fans in this country with its stirring games in the World Cup and Olympics the last two years.
Neither the Women's United Soccer Association, which folded in 2003, nor Women's Professional Soccer, which ceased operations in May, could survive beyond three seasons.
The W.U.S.A. was reported to have suffered losses totaling $100 million, while poor attendance and operational infighting kept W.P.S. from gaining traction.
So what has to happen this time to make the concept work?
''I don't know that answer,'' said the American striker Abby Wambach, whose two goals Saturday night gave her 152 for her career, moving her to within six of Mia Hamm's international record. ''I guess we'll have to wait and find out. I have no idea.''
Wambach, who combined with the team's rising star, Alex Morgan, to tie a 21-year-old national team record for combined goals in a calendar year, was a featured member of the troubled Boca Raton-based magicJack franchise in the W.P.S.
Even with U.S. Soccer taking the administrative lead in the new league and vowing to subsidize the salaries of up to 24 players from the national team, Wambach remains circumspect.
''Honestly, it's happened two times,'' Wambach said. ''It's risen and fallen two times. Those two times I was wrong.''
Kate Markgraf, a former defender on the national team and now an analyst for NBC, is optimistic the latest economic model will be more sustainable than the previous two incarnations.
The Canadian Soccer Association and the Mexican Federation of Football have also vowed to subsidize salaries for up to 16 members of their respective national teams who join the new league.
''That's the model that works in Germany, in France and in Sweden,'' Markgraf said, ''where it's supported by the federation, anchored by the federation. That's just right now how the sporting landscape is for women and women in soccer. This might be the way to go.''
But whatever the fate of the new league, the popularity of the current American team clearly remains strong, although not mighty enough to come close to filling a 30,000-seat stadium for a friendly against a modest opponent like China.
Wambach and her teammates played before average crowds of more than 15,000 during their three-and-a-half-month post-Olympics barnstorming tour around the United States. Along the way, there were three sellouts, including one in Wambach's hometown, Rochester, N.Y.
Saturday's foot-stomping crowd, which featured dozens of homemade signs in honor of various American players, was actually the second smallest of the victory tour. Only Portland (10,092) failed to produce a bigger turnout than the one that watched the United States women dispatch China for the third time in a week.
The tour also included two victories over Ireland and Australia, a romp over Costa Rica and a pair of draws with Germany in October.
The one thing missing from the tour was rematches with Canada or Japan, the final two formidable hurdles the United States had to clear along the path to Olympic gold in London four months ago.
Wambach, whose 27 goals this year were her second-highest total in a single season, was among those expressing enthusiasm about the coming transition to the new United States coach, Tom Sermanni, hired in October to replace Pia Sundhage.
Sermanni, formerly the Australian national team coach, will make his American debut on Feb. 9 in Jacksonville, Fla., with a friendly against his native Scotland. He will have a long lead time to the next World Cup, which will take place in 2015 in Canada.
In the interim, the team will play friendlies and in tournaments, and many of its players will take a chance on the new league, which will have franchises in Boston, Chicago, Kansas City, Portland, Washington, Western New York, Seattle and Piscataway, N.J.
Markgraf noted that in the past, a popular women's national team -- think of Mia Hamm and Julie Foudy -- had not translated into healthy attendance when professional leagues were formed.
But the current women's team, she added, might be able to break that barrier and allow a professional league to succeed.
''I think this is a team that has become bigger, the biggest women's soccer team this country has ever had,'' she said. ''These players are known as a team, but also as individuals, so I think this is the best chance they're going to have.''
While Morgan stressed the need for quality training and coaching in the new league, Rapinoe said it would be vital to start on a ''smaller scale'' and grow the league organically.
''Should we play in a stadium like this for the women's league?'' Rapinoe said, looking around. ''No, we need to play in smaller stadiums, get the atmosphere going. If there's 3,000 to 5,000 in a small stadium, that's a great atmosphere. It's intimate, and you start to build from there. I definitely think the appetite is there.''
That remains to be seen, but Wambach cracked a sly smile when pressed on the biggest need to make women's pro soccer thrive this time.
''We need richer owners,'' she said. ''Period.''

HEADLINE: That Terrible Trillion

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
As you might imagine, I find myself in a lot of discussions about U.S. fiscal policy, and the budget deficit in particular. And there's one thing I can count on in these discussions: At some point someone will announce, in dire tones, that we have a ONE TRILLION DOLLAR deficit.
No, I don't think the people making this pronouncement realize that they sound just like Dr. Evil in the Austin Powers movies. 
Anyway, we do indeed have a ONE TRILLION DOLLAR deficit, or at least we did; in fiscal 2012, which ended in September, the deficit was actually $1.089 trillion. (It will be lower this year.) The question is what lesson we should take from that figure.
What the Dr. Evil types think, and want you to think, is that the big current deficit is a sign that our fiscal position is completely unsustainable. Sometimes they argue that it means that a debt crisis is just around the corner, although they've been predicting that for years and it keeps not happening. (U.S. borrowing costs are near historic lows.) But more often they use the deficit to argue that we can't afford to maintain programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. So it's important to understand that this is completely wrong.
Now, America does have a long-run budget problem, thanks to our aging population and the rising cost of health care. However, the current deficit has nothing to do with that problem, and says nothing at all about the sustainability of our social insurance programs. Instead, it mainly reflects the depressed state of the economy -- a depression that would be made even worse by attempts to shrink the deficit rapidly.
So, let's talk about the numbers.
The first thing we need to ask is what a sustainable budget would look like. The answer is that in a growing economy, budgets don't have to be balanced to be sustainable. Federal debt was higher at the end of the Clinton years than at the beginning -- that is, the deficits of the Clinton administration's early years outweighed the surpluses at the end. Yet because gross domestic product rose over those eight years, the best measure of our debt position, the ratio of debt to G.D.P., fell dramatically, from 49 to 33 percent.
Right now, given reasonable estimates of likely future growth and inflation, we would have a stable or declining ratio of debt to G.D.P. even if we had a $400 billion deficit. You can argue that we should do better; but if the question is whether current deficits are sustainable, you should take $400 billion off the table right away.
That still leaves $600 billion or so. What's that about? It's the depressed economy -- full stop.
First of all, the weakness of the economy has led directly to lower revenues; when G.D.P. falls, the federal tax take falls too, and in fact always falls substantially more in percentage terms. On top of that, revenue is temporarily depressed by tax breaks, notably the payroll tax cut, that have been put in place to support the economy but will be withdrawn as soon as the economy is stronger (or, unfortunately, even before then). If you do the math, it seems likely that full economic recovery would raise revenue by at least $450 billion.
Meanwhile, the depressed economy has also temporarily raised spending, because more people qualify for unemployment insurance and means-tested programs like food stamps and Medicaid. A reasonable estimate is that economic recovery would reduce federal spending on such programs by at least $150 billion.
Putting all this together, it turns out that the trillion-dollar deficit isn't a sign of unsustainable finances at all. Some of the deficit is in fact sustainable; just about all of the rest would go away if we had an economic recovery.
And the prospects for economic recovery are looking pretty good right now -- or would be looking good if it weren't for the political risks posed by Republican hostage-taking. Housing is reviving, consumer debt is down, employment has improved steadily among prime-age workers. Unfortunately, this recovery may well be derailed by the fiscal cliff and/or a confrontation over the debt ceiling; but this has nothing to do with the alleged unsustainability of the deficit.
Which brings us back to ONE TRILLION DOLLARS.
We do indeed have a big budget deficit, and other things equal it would be better if the deficit were a lot smaller. But other things aren't equal; the deficit is a side-effect of an economic depression, and the first order of business should be to end that depression -- which means, among other things, leaving the deficit alone for now.
And you should recognize all the hyped-up talk about the deficit for what it is: yet another disingenuous attempt to scare and bully the body politic into abandoning programs that shield both poor and middle-class Americans from harm.

HEADLINE: Onetime Allies in Antitrust Part Ways Over Google

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
In the digital economy, 14 years is an eternity. Fast-shifting technology means that companies, once feared and seemingly invincible, fade, while new powers rise to dominance, raising fresh sets of concerns.
Exhibit A: In the spring of 1998, the federal government and 20 states filed a landmark antitrust suit against Microsoft. A few months later, Google was founded.
Now Google is the subject of major antitrust investigations in the United States and Europe. In the United States, regulators are expected to announce a decision within days to sue or settle, and under what terms. The European decision will come soon as well.
Much has changed over the years, but two lawyers who helped build the case against Microsoft are playing important roles once again. But this time, Gary L. Reback and Susan A. Creighton are on opposite sides. 
The two lawyers, and the positions they have taken, point to some striking similarities yet also significant differences between the two high-stakes investigations -- and why the pursuit of Google has proved challenging for antitrust officials.
In 1996, Mr. Reback and Ms. Creighton were partners, representing Netscape, the pioneering Web browser company. They wrote a 222-page ''white paper,'' laying out Microsoft's campaign to use its dominance of personal computer software to stifle competition from Netscape, the Internet insurgent. After Netscape sent their report to the Justice Department, the head of the antitrust division ordered an investigation.
Mr. Reback is now an attorney at Carr & Ferrell in Silicon Valley, where he represents several companies that have complained to the government about Google. He does not represent Microsoft, though that company is a born-again champion of antitrust action, against its rival Google.
In Google, Mr. Reback sees a familiar pattern -- a giant company trying to hinder competition and attack new markets. Google, he says, is unfairly using its dominant search engine to favor the company's offerings in online shopping, travel and local listings and thus stifle competition from Web sites that rely on Google search for traffic.
''From my perspective, it's an instant replay of the Microsoft case,'' Mr. Reback said in a recent interview, though he would not comment for this article. ''It's the same playbook.''
Not to Ms. Creighton, a partner in the Washington office of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati, who is in Google's corner. She has testified before Congress on Google's behalf and negotiated with the Federal Trade Commission, the agency conducting the antitrust investigation, and where she was a senior official during the Bush administration.
''Google's conduct is pro-competitive,'' Ms. Creighton declared in her Senate testimony last year. ''Far from threatening competition, Google has consistently enhanced consumer welfare by increasing the services available to consumers.''
Ms. Creighton hits two main themes in Google's defense. The first is the consumer benefit of all Google's free services. The second is that the cost to consumers of switching to Internet alternatives like Microsoft's Bing search engine, the Expedia travel site or Yelp local listings is ''zero,'' she said. Or, as Google repeatedly says, competition is ''just a click away.''
In the late 1990s, Microsoft had its version of both arguments. Microsoft bundled a free Web browser into its Windows operating system -- an added feature at no cost, surely a consumer benefit. In its trial testimony, Microsoft showed that millions of people had downloaded the competing Netscape browser onto Windows -- a rival product just a double-click away.
But in the trial, the evidence taken as a whole portrayed a wide-ranging effort by Microsoft to crush Netscape. It is not an antitrust violation for a powerful company to gain a dominant share of one market and then expand into other markets. The legal issue is the tactics the dominant company employs to expand its empire.
In the Microsoft case, the evidence showed that it had bullied industry partners and had negotiated deals to try to thwart Netscape's advance. The internal e-mail and witness testimony was damning, including an account of a meeting with a Microsoft executive who said its strategy was to ''cut off Netscape's air supply.''
In Silicon Valley today, venture capitalists routinely tell start-ups to steer clear of Google's plans, as they once did with Microsoft. ''I tell them to know what Google's flight path is,'' said Mitchell Kapor, a venture investor and former technology executive, who competed against Microsoft. ''If you do something that falls under their shadow, you feel a chill.''
Still, Mr. Kapor said, the industry environment is quite different today. ''The Google guys grew up with the Internet and its openness,'' he said. ''Without the open Internet, there would be no Google, and they understand that.''
Others point to another force that helped Google -- government action. ''Without the antitrust case and the restraints on its behavior, Microsoft would have built search into the operating system and we might not have had Google,'' said Christine Varney, a lawyer who represented Netscape in Washington and is the former head of the antitrust division the Justice Department in the Obama administration.
The Google claim that the company faces genuine competition today in its key markets like search and search advertising is an exaggeration, industry executives say.
But things are more open, as Mr. Kapor says. And there are other digital giants in technology -- Apple, Facebook and Amazon -- in nearby markets with designs on parts of Google's business, in a way that was not the case in Microsoft's heyday. For example, 30 percent of online shoppers in America begin their search on Amazon, more than twice the share for Google.
''Google inhabits a larger, more complex and faster-moving environment than Microsoft did in the 1990s,'' observed William E. Kovacic, former chairman of the F.T.C. ''So the difficulty of both diagnosis and remedy seems greater than in the case of Microsoft.''
Mr. Reback and Ms. Creighton are both products of elite universities; he is Yale and Stanford Law, she is Harvard and Stanford Law. But former colleagues say the two have sharply contrasting personalities and, to some degree, ideologies.
Mercurial and impassioned, Mr. Reback strongly believes that government should be the guardian of competition, especially in high-tech markets. He laid out his view in a book, published three years ago, ''Free the Market! Why Only the Government Can Keep the Marketplace Competitive.'' ''Dominant firms can more easily manipulate these markets,'' he wrote. ''And natural forces make the strong even stronger.''
Ms. Creighton is quieter, more understated, and has a wry sense of humor. In 2001, after the Microsoft trial, she joined the F.T.C., but before the company reached a settlement with the Justice Department. She joked with a reporter that joining the Bush administration was her exit strategy. ''Unlike you,'' she said, ''I am off the Microsoft case.''
At the time, Ms. Creighton called herself a ''law-and-order Republican'' -- laws should be enforced, but government intervention is a tool to be used sparingly.
''Susan is a superb advocate, and one not inclined to defend absurdities,'' said Mr. Kovacic, who worked with Ms. Creighton at the F.T.C.
Mr. Reback, he said, brings a deep belief and passion to his work. ''For Gary,'' said Mr. Kovacic, who is also a professor at George Washington University Law School, ''there are no molehills, only mountains.''

HEADLINE: Talks Highlight A Structural Divide

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD; Jackie Calmes and Jonathan Weisman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - To Democrats, Republican resistance to raising tax rates on affluent Americans seems not only stubborn, but also befuddling and self-defeating.
Public opinion strongly favors it. President Obama just won re-election campaigning more strongly on the tax issue than on any other. Federal revenue as a share of the economy is near a 60-year low. Washington faces a $1 trillion annual deficit.
Yet even as some party leaders and intellectuals urge them to concede the point, most rank-and-file House Republicans refuse. That is why Speaker John A. Boehner has moved so gingerly, finally offering late last week to raise rates only on incomes of $1 million or more, despite calls from Senate Republicans for a deeper concession.
The reasons run deep in the structure of 21st-century American politics, and the modern Republican Party. 
The national exit poll conducted by Edison Research for the November election illustrates how polarization by party and ideology has estranged the coalitions behind Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner in their stalled negotiations.
Seven of 10 Obama voters said government should be doing more to solve problems. Eight in 10 voters said tax rates should rise. (Two-thirds said tax rates should rise for incomes over $250,000, and another 13 percent said taxes should go up for everyone.) By contrast, 8 in 10 voters who backed the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, said government already did too much. A 54 percent majority said no one's tax rates should rise.
Those national numbers actually understate the homogeneity of constituencies that returned a Republican majority to power in the House. Because state legislatures draw most House districts to favor their own majority party, more than 80 percent of those elected to the House won with at least 55 percent of the vote.
As a result, the everyday interactions Republicans have with their constituents and colleagues reinforce a lower-tax worldview diametrically opposed to that of their Democratic counterparts - and out of step with most Americans. The biggest threat to their careers is primary challenges from opponents more conservative than they are.
"It's who they are," said Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma. "It's the air they breathe. It's what the Republican electorate produces."
Mr. Cole, a former chief of staff for the Republican National Committee, has lately become Mr. Obama's unlikely ally. He has tried, fruitlessly so far, to convince his colleagues that yielding to the president on higher rates for families with incomes of more than $250,000 would spare the party political damage while allowing them to fight the administration later on spending cuts.
What Mr. Boehner has proposed is allowing the top rate to revert to 39.6 percent for income of $1 million and above, and to raise his total for new revenue over 10 years to $1 trillion from $800 billion, according to a person familiar with his latest offer. That rate increase would raise far less revenue than Mr. Obama's plan, which would affect many more taxpayers.
In return, according to the person familiar with the talks, Mr. Boehner is seeking concessions from Mr. Obama on spending cuts now, rather than waiting until next year as Senate Republicans have suggested. Contrary to some reports, Mr. Boehner would also like to have some increase in the nation's borrowing limit as part of a year-end compromise on the Bush-era tax cuts and spending to avoid another battle over a Congressional vote to raise the limit, which will be needed as soon as January.
But as grudgingly as Mr. Boehner has moved even that far, there is no guarantee that he could sell such a proposal to his caucus even if Mr. Obama were to accept it. That underscores the difficulty of bridging the chasm between the principal negotiators.
"I don't think the president has any earthly idea" of the strength of Republican opposition, Mr. Cole said. "He moves in a different political culture."
The cultural gap between the parties once was narrower - before conservative Southern Democrats became Republicans, liberal northern Republicans became Democrats and centrists dwindled. In 1990, days before Mr. Boehner was elected to the House, a Republican president, George Bush, joined a Democratic-controlled Congress to enact tax increases as part of a deficit-reduction package.
Of the 47 House Republicans who voted "aye" in 1990, only two remain. Of the 19 Senate Republicans, only two remain. One of those senators, Richard G. Lugar of Indiana, will leave office in January after losing his seat in a Republican primary. The Tea Party challenger who defeated him then lost to a Democrat.
"The sad story of the Republican Party is that we've become the party of primaries," said Kim Alfano, Mr. Lugar's media consultant.
The 2012 Republican presidential primaries foreshadowed the difficulty Mr. Boehner now faces. In one debate, every candidate including Mr. Romney rejected the notion of a budget deal that would include tax increases even if accompanied by spending cuts 10 times as large.
"That was a danger sign," said Peter Wehner, a deputy to former President George W. Bush's top political strategist, Karl Rove.
Because conservative voters outnumber liberals, ideological compromise comes more easily to Democrats. Self-described conservatives (35 percent of the electorate) cast 6 in 10 votes for Mr. Romney; those identifying as liberals (25 percent) cast 4 in 10 for Mr. Obama.
Now the prospect of blame for tax increases, spending cuts and an economic downturn forces Mr. Boehner and his allies to seek a compromise. If Mr. Obama accepts deeper spending cuts, Mr. Cole said, enough Republicans would brave anger from their base and back higher tax rates to permit a deal. Mr. Boehner could abandon trying to win over most of his caucus and assemble a majority made up principally of Democrats. But that would mean gambling with his speakership.
"He'd have to persuade them he is doing them a favor by allowing them to vote 'no' " on tax increases, said Representative Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the top House Democrat on budget issues. "I think he could pursue that strategy and keep his job."
Reaction from the conservative news media poses another risk if Republicans compromise. "How does Fox play this?" asked former Representative Tom Davis, a Virginia Republican and former chairman of his party's campaign committee.
The White House hopes another powerful voice may tip the balance. Many of Republicans' traditional business backers have urged a deal including tax increases to keep the economy from tipping back into a recession.
"Their position as the party of no new taxes is unsustainable," said Bernadette Budde, who retired this month as a strategist for the Business Industry Political Action Committee. "If you're not going to listen to the business community about economic problems, who are you going to listen to? Some talk-radio host? Some blogger? Some political operative?"
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Alaska's Open Spaces Open Up Even More

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
ANCHORAGE -- A quietly profound generational change is about to sweep through federal agencies here in the nation's biggest and wildest state -- but also by many measures, its most government-dependent -- where hundreds of millions of acres of public land are set aside for national parks and preserves.
The change is being driven by new rules in the federal retirement system that Congress started to phase in in 2009 and, by dint of various schedules and formulas, are hitting home between now and Jan 1. The new rules are focused specifically on equalizing retirement benefits among workers in Alaska, Hawaii, American territories and the lower 48 states.
At the Bureau of Land Management, which oversees the 23-million-acre National Petroleum Reserve, among other vast properties, close to 8 percent of senior staff members are retiring by the end of the year, while more than 7 percent of National Park Service employees have so far said they will do the same. 
At the federal Fish and Wildlife Service, which manages 16 wildlife refuges in the state, about one in 11 workers -- mostly senior managers, including top officials at five of the refuges -- will clock out for the last time on or before Dec. 31.
''It's unprecedented,'' said Mitch Ellis, the service's assistant regional director in charge of Alaskan refuges. ''We've never had to fill that many manager positions at once before.''
The turnover comes at a time of intense focus and pressure for agencies like the Fish and Wildlife Service, which is being hit by both the 2009 Congressional act in retirement accounting and an agency-specific package this year that allows early retirements. Years of frozen budgets that started during the recession have already reduced staff and operations. The changes also come against a backdrop of sometimes heated discussion over the service's shifting mission -- how to protect wildlife as giant debates about climate change and energy exploration grip the Arctic.
The agency's law enforcement arm, which deals with illegal animal harvests and the protection of endangered species, will have relatively few departures, officials said. But often, they said, real protection comes down to education and personal relationships in villages in remote areas -- and those conversations, because of new leadership at the refuges, will change.
''This is not a good thing for us,'' said David C. Raskin, a former president of the Friends of Alaska National Wildlife Refuges, a group that works with and supports the agency's work. ''We have contacts. We know who to call.''
In terms of pure head count, the numbers could look trivial. About 55 or so mostly senior managers, scientists and wildlife experts out of a work force of 600 at the Fish and Wildlife Service, spread across Alaska's vast terrain, have indicated that they will take the retirement package. At the National Park Service, 36 of about 500 employees have said they plan to leave -- though the number could change as people reconsider before the end of the year. The driving force pushing people out is that if they stay into next year, they will have to work a year or more to get the full retirement benefits under the new law.
If talks in Washington fail to avert the automatic tax increases and spending cuts scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1 -- the so-called fiscal cliff, or sequestration -- the effect of the retirements would be compounded, Fish and Wildlife Service officials said, by the question of what positions could then be refilled at all.
''With sequestration, there's an 8 percent reduction,'' said Doug Alcorn, an assistant regional director who is among the retirees. ''Managers would have to prioritize.''
But the impact is not just in the number of people who are going.
At the Fish and Wildlife Service, for example, retirees will take with them more than 1,000 years of cumulative institutional wisdom and conservation experience. At the United States Forest Service's Recreation, Lands and Minerals Office, for example, four top leaders, including the senior minerals geologist, are departing.
And many of these people were shaped by a perspective formed in a very different time in Alaska and the nation -- mostly the 1970s, when the environmental movement was young and bursting with muscular and sometimes hippie-tinged enthusiasm.
Alaska, back then, was a magnet for wildlife biologists and seekers of a life at the frontier. The bush was ''back to the land'' at its most extreme -- a force fueled by what one retiring refuge supervisor, Mike Boylan, called ''the John Denver effect.''
''Everybody coming out of college wanted to go to the woods, into the wild,'' Mr. Boylan said. ''Alaska was the big one, if you could get up here.''
Alaska is also different than the other areas affected by the federal retirement rule changes in that the federal role here is pervasive and overwhelming. About 226 million acres, almost the size of Texas and Wyoming combined, is federal property in Alaska.
''Alaska was almost written in my destiny,'' said Bill Larned, 64, a biologist and pilot who started at the Fish and Wildlife Service in 1976 after working as a pack outfitter in Wyoming.
Environmental groups and agency officials also say the retirement wave is momentous in what happens next: new blood coming in at a time when some elements of the old Alaska -- doughty homesteaders, trappers and subsistence hunters -- are fading. And while environmental groups like the Sierra Club might have once focused on endangered species, climate change -- hitting the Arctic with significant effect -- is now the focus and the pressure point in dealing with federal land agencies.
''We're making sure that we're protecting the land and animals that are part of the Arctic,'' said Lindsey Hajduk, an Arctic organizer at the Anchorage Sierra Club office. ''But it's in the larger context of climate change.''
Some critics of the federal government's role in Alaska -- a tension that dates back to territorial days -- said they hoped new blood would be an improvement.
''The loss of knowledge is going to be hard,'' said Doug Vincent-Lang, the acting director at the wildlife conservation division of the Alaska Department of Fish and Game. But Mr. Vincent-Lang said he thought the Fish and Wildlife Service had ''fallen away'' from its traditional mission of wildlife counts, which were long part of Alaska's culture of hunting. ''Maybe they'll come back to it,'' he said.
Some retiring workers said that as technology has become more and more a tool of landscape study and protection, younger, more tech-savvy leadership might also be good for the wild lands.
''The younger people coming up have such a better handle on how new forms of technology can be used in conservation,'' said Paul Liedberg, 59, the manager at Togiak National Wildlife Refuge in southwest Alaska, who plans to retire after 36 years. ''I cannot even imagine it the way they can.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Hunger for Yogurt Leads to Gigantic Factory

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Chobani, the yogurt company that grew from nothing five years ago to a roughly $1 billion powerhouse today, on Monday will formally open one of the world's largest yogurt-processing plants in Twin Falls, Idaho.
''I'm so excited,'' said Hamdi Ulukaya, founder and chief executive of Chobani. ''I've been waiting for this moment for so long.''
The $450 million, 1 million square-foot plant is the company's second. It will employ 300 people, and Mr. Ulukaya said for every 10 jobs it creates directly, it is expected to create roughly 66 additional jobs in ancillary businesses. ''The state expects the total economic impact of our business there to be $1.3 billion,'' he said. 
In exchange, Chobani qualified for a variety of state tax incentives, including property tax exemption and credit off tax liabilities. Idaho's position as one of the country's largest milk producers and the transportation network around Twin Falls also were attractions, Mr. Ulukaya said.
The new plant is yet another sign of America's growing appetite for yogurt and its willingness to embrace new brands over old, as evidenced by Chobani's explosive growth as well as that of Fage and now, Muller Quaker Dairy, a joint venture between PepsiCo and Unternehmensgruppe Theo Muller, a privately held German dairy company.
The Muller Quaker Dairy products are currently sold only between Boston and Washington, D.C., and in the Great Lakes region.
That has led some to worry about oversaturation, but Mr. Ulukaya said there is still plenty of room for growth. ''Americans still eat far less yogurt than people in other parts of the world,'' he said.
He said some retailers are even increasing the amount of refrigerated shelf space they allot to yogurt to accommodate all the new brands and varieties that are popping up.
Chobani plans to take advantage of that with more product lines manufactured in its new plant. The biggest breakthrough is the Chobani Champions Tube, just over two ounces of low-fat Chobani Greek yogurt with fruit purée packed into a tube that requires no spoon.
''Natural, with no preservatives, no coloring, nothing ugly in there, perfect for lunch bags, with Chobani's thickness and creaminess,'' Mr. Ulukaya said. ''Moms are going to love it, and I'm afraid I'm going to be eating it that way all the time from now on.''
The new plant also will turn out the Chobani Bite, a small cup of yogurt, 100 calories or less, sold in a cluster of four and intended for snacking. ''I'm going to keep the flavors of these a surprise,'' Mr. Ulukaya said, but they ''will have some kind of a bite to them.''
The third new product the plant will be responsible for is the Chobani Flip, a square package with one corner containing nuts, granola, dried fruits or other ingredients that can be added to the yogurt.
The plant will supply those products to the entire country and traditional six-ounce and larger containers to the West, while the New York plant will continue to supply the traditional products in the East.
''I can still remember packing the first 300 cases in the fall of 2007,'' Mr. Ulukaya said. ''It took us all night to do it because the filler didn't work very well, just me and Kyle, who's now the executive vice president of sales,'' he said, referring to Kyle O'Brien. ''It's been an amazing journey.''

HEADLINE: Life Sentences for Low-Level Crimes

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''For Lesser Crimes, Rethinking Life Behind Bars'' (''Time and Punishment'' series, front page, Dec. 12) reveals the injustices and ruined lives emanating from barbaric policies that punish low-level drug crimes with life imprisonment. Sentences are way out of proportion to the crimes committed. Widespread pardons and commutations are in order.
Forget the economic costs to society. These policies deserve to crumble because they are immoral. Confining Stephanie George, a mother of three, and one of the cases described in the story, for life, in an 11-by-7-foot cell shared with another person, for possession of half a kilogram of cocaine is a grotesque misuse of government power. 
Americans perhaps prize individual freedom above all else, yet no other democracy permanently locks up so many of its citizens.
MICHAEL PETIT President, Every Child Matters Washington, Dec. 12, 2012
To the Editor:
During the 15 years that Stephanie George has been in prison because of mandatory sentencing, we have learned a lot about the effects of a parent's incarceration on children.
International advocates have recognized parental incarceration as the greatest threat to child well-being in the United States. Millions of children are separated from their parents and are confused about the meaning of fairness and justice, and are often told that their futures are limited because of their parents' actions.
We expect Ms. George to learn from her choices, but we as a society have not learned from ours. It is time we change policies that take a mother away from her children for life at little or no benefit to public safety and at great cost to taxpayers. No other country separates so many families and treats its children this way.
TANYA KRUPAT Brooklyn, Dec. 13, 2012
The writer is program director of the New York Initiative for Children of Incarcerated Parents, Osborne Association.
To the Editor:
Your article pointed out that there are 500,000 people in prison or jail for drug crimes. This is a staggering statistic that is compounded to the point of amazement by the fact that most of those serving these draconian sentences are nonviolent.
I speak from the vantage of someone who served a mandatory 15-to-life sentence under the Rockefeller drug laws of New York State for a first-time nonviolent drug offense in 1985.
I wound up serving 12 years of that sentence before Gov. George A. Pataki granted me executive clemency.
The bottom line is that mandatory minimum sentencing laws have proved to be a failure. It's time that we abolish these laws and instead institute a system that protects society and is cost-efficient and fair for all.
ANTHONY PAPA Manager of Media Relations Drug Policy Alliance New York, Dec. 12, 2012
To the Editor:
Laws requiring mandatory minimum periods of imprisonment, a result of politicians' wish to appear tough on crime, often result in unfair and unduly harsh sentences.
Across our country, people are serving lengthy sentences that are altogether disproportionate to their crimes and circumstances. The judiciary should have the responsibility of weighing the goals of sentencing to find the length of imprisonment that is just and appropriate for individual offenders.
While there have been some reforms, mandatory minimum sentences often cause the imprisonment of offenders for far longer than is sufficient or necessary. Taxpayers bear some of the financial costs, but the offenders, their families and their communities also suffer under the weight of these unjust laws.

HEADLINE: Its Restaurants Empty And Its Trains Stalled, Hoboken Encounters Storm's Increasing Toll

BYLINE: By RAY RIVERA; Nate Schweber contributed reporting.

 BODY:
HOBOKEN, N.J. -- It is happy hour at the Hotel Victor Bar and Grill on a Friday and the place is nearly empty. The evening commuters who would normally be emerging from the PATH train station across the street about this time, filling streets with thousands of potential customers, are nowhere in sight.
''We should be booming right now,'' David Rousso, the bar's owner, said.
Hurricane Sandy inflicted an estimated $7 billion in damage on transit systems across the region. Harder to calculate is the toll on the economy leveled by commuter disruptions. 
And perhaps no place has felt that impact more acutely than Hoboken. This city of 50,000 on the banks of the Hudson River thrives on its easy access to trains, buses and ferries into Manhattan. According to census surveys, an estimated 56 percent workers here use public transportation every day, surpassing New York City as the most transit-reliant community in the nation.
That convenience has played a crucial role in the city's evolution from a rough-hewed factory town to an enclave of upscale bars and restaurants and pricey condominiums with unfettered views of the Manhattan skyline.
But as the hurricane ripped through the region, seawater flooded half the city, and crippled the PATH station at Hoboken Terminal. Now, even as commuter services have returned to normal in much of the region, the station remains closed, severing a critical artery for workers traveling to and from Manhattan.
Nearly 30,000 passengers use the station every weekday, according to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the PATH system.
Many who use the station come from neighboring communities to connect to the PATH -- that is, when it is open.
Closed, it has cast a pall over the city, doubling commute times for residents, many of whom are having to pay more for transit alternatives like ferries. It has also slowed the foot traffic around the terminal that is critical to downtown businesses. In interviews, downtown business owners who were lucky enough not to lose their store to flooding reported drops in sales of 25 percent to 70 percent.
Adding to the frustration is the uncertainty over when the station will reopen. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey has declined to give estimates, saying only that it could take weeks.
''Nobody is telling anybody anything,'' said Mr. Rousso, a former Wall Street trader who opened the bar in April after spending thousands of dollars to renovate it. ''There's been nothing from government. There's been nothing from the Port Authority. So we're sitting here in the dark. How long do you stick it out.''
Mr. Rousso estimates that business is down by more than half on any given day in what should be one of the busiest times of the year.
''Holiday time usually picks up your first three months of the new year, because those are slow,'' he said.
By chance, Mr. Rousso produced a commercial for the bar before the storm hit. It began airing on local television last week but has so far ''fallen on deaf ears,'' he said.
No one has tallied the economic losses of transit disruptions across the region. But in a 2011 report for New York State, Dr. Klaus H. Jacob, a climate scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University, estimated that a storm like Hurricane Sandy could cause $10 billion in physical damage to the region's public transportation systems and another $48 billion in economic damages caused by transportation disruptions.
By the time everything is counted, he said in an interview, ''I believe our predictions will be eerily close.''
Even businesses blocks away from the Hoboken Terminal have had a significant drop in sales.
Hoboken on Rye, a kosher-style deli on First Street, sits about halfway between the PATH terminal and the Second Street station of the Hudson-Bergen Light Rail, which many people take to Hoboken to transfer to the PATH, as the Port Authority Trans-Hudson railway is known.
''When the PATH is running, they go from there and they have to go past my building,'' said Dennis Blair, 63, who owns the deli with his son. ''It's like cattle.''
Without that foot traffic, Mr. Blair said, business is down about 25 percent. A sign in his window reads: ''Shop Local, Help Rebuild Hoboken.''
The sign is one of many that have appeared in city storefronts after the storm. Seven weeks later, the physical damage is still apparent. Shops going west along First Street past Garden Street, which became a river during the storm, remain shuttered, their floors and walls stripped out.
Signs on the city's flooded Multi-Service Community Center, which houses a number of city services, directs people to makeshift locations. The city estimates it suffered about $10 million dollars of damage to its buildings and infrastructure, not including losses to private businesses and homes.
Officials are still trying to assess the total damage the storm wrought on the city. ''We don't have total estimates yet,'' the city's mayor, Dawn Zimmer, said. ''But I know from walking around, from talking to different business owners, that they're definitely hard hit.''
The ripples are being felt across the Hudson River in New York.
Vibeke Koszeghy, an architect who lives in Hoboken, used to take the 8 a.m. PATH train to arrive at her Union Square office by 8:30. Now, to get to work on time, she said, she takes a 6:20 or 6:30 a.m. bus.
''I just changed my life,'' she said waiting for a bus along Washington Street early on a recent morning.
It's also changed her evening routine, sharply reducing the amount of time she spends in Manhattan to take advantage of her limited travel options back home. A regular arts patron, she recently gave away tickets to Lincoln Center.
''It has changed people's lives to the point they no longer do anything in the city,'' she said. ''That's really hurting both people's social lives and New York business.''
At the WindMill, a New Jersey fast-food franchise half a block from the terminal, the owners have sharply cut back the hours of their 20 employees. The restaurant typically stays open until 1 a.m. on weekdays and 4 a.m. on weekends, and depends on the nearby bar crowd for late-night customers.
''Hoboken is known as a bar town,'' said Tim Cochrane, another former Wall Street trader and one of the co-owners. ''The price of a drink here is half the price of a drink in Manhattan. So you get a lot of young professionals who come over on the PATH and hit the bars. And what better than chili cheese fries and a hot dog before you go home?''
Come 2 a.m. on a typical Friday or Saturday night, ''and you can't get through here,'' he said. ''So we've lost that.''

HEADLINE: Ailing Mayor Of Boston Says He's Still Up to the Job

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
BOSTON -- He was an accidental mayor, not even aspiring to the job. Plenty of people thought he was not up to it. But after almost 20 years in City Hall, Thomas M. Menino is the longest-serving mayor in Boston history and fits this city like an old shoe.
There may be no greater testimony to his hold on the office than this: Mr. Menino, who turns 70 later this month, has been hospitalized since Oct. 26 with multiple ailments and yet no politician has called for him to step aside. Some in the news media have suggested, gently, that he should quit while he is ahead, but no potential challenger has made a peep about running for mayor next year, whether or not Mr. Menino seeks an unprecedented sixth term.
''My attitude is this,'' Mr. Menino said in an interview the other day at Spaulding Rehabilitation Hospital after pedaling for several minutes on a stationary recumbent bicycle. ''I've run for mayor five times now and I've won all five times.'' 
''Overwhelmingly,'' interjected his press secretary, Dot Joyce.
''Overwhelmingly,'' the mayor added. ''How I explain this is, people have to have faith in you. That's the key to this whole thing. That was Mitt Romney's problem -- people didn't believe in him.''
Can Mr. Menino make voters believe in him again after his long hospitalization?
''Watch me!'' he declared.
Mr. Menino has only hinted that he might run again. And if he does, several political analysts agree, he will win.
''Politically, he's still Babe Ruth and Ted Williams rolled into one,'' said Rob Gray, a Republican strategist.
There is plenty of political jockeying here right now with the possibility of Senator John Kerry's seat opening up, if Mr. Kerry is appointed to the Obama administration, and a governor's race in 2014. But Mr. Menino's grip on City Hall appears secure.
''Others have tried and failed to take him down,'' Mr. Gray said. ''And because of his political operation and because of his ability to raise money, nobody wants to take him on. They think it's political suicide.''
The difference this time is that Mr. Menino, a hands-on mayor who likes to amble all over town, has not been seen in public since Oct. 14, when he and his wife, Angela, left for Italy to celebrate their 46th wedding anniversary. While there, he came down with a viral infection and returned to Boston, entering Brigham and Women's Hospital on Oct. 26.
He was treated for an upper respiratory infection and a blood clot that had traveled to his lungs from his leg. While in the hospital, he sustained a compression fracture in his lower spine, then developed an infection in that same area. He also received a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes. He already had Crohn's disease, an inflammation of the intestine, and was overweight.
On Nov. 26, he was transferred to Spaulding to regain the strength he lost during his extended hospital stay. Three days later, he held a news conference in the hospital.
Mr. Menino, who was never the clearest of speakers, earning him the moniker Mumbles, was slurring his words. Though mentally alert and even humorous -- he said he would not retire because his retirement package ''wasn't good enough'' -- he appeared weak and lethargic.
The video surprised viewers and led many to speculate online that his condition was worse than they were being told. ''That was actually one of the most heartbreaking things that I have seen,'' one commenter wrote on bostonglobe.com. ''Because that was clearly a man who knows that he's done and everyone around him knows it as well.''
But last week, in an hourlong interview, he appeared more energetic and did not slur his words. He said the painful spasms in his back were gone. He had lost eight pounds in three weeks. Dr. Jaye E. Hefner, his attending physician at Spaulding, said that Mr. Menino was taking a blood thinner and had to complete a round of antibiotics but that he generally needed little more than an occasional Tylenol.
No one knows exactly when he may leave the hospital, but Dr. Hefner said he would surely be home before Christmas. From a medical point of view, she said, she saw no reason he could not run for re-election.
Still, he had trouble moving from his recumbent bike to a chair and could not do so without help. But once seated, he sounded like a man in charge, with more to accomplish.
''Strength-wise, I can't carry 100 pounds of cement, but I'm dealing with the everyday operations of the city,'' he said. ''Being in the hospital set me back a little bit, but it made me do a lot of thinking about where I can move the city over the next couple of years.''
He said he wanted to bring economic development to some of the islands in Boston Harbor. He also wants to help hospital patients who do not have the privileges that he has. ''We need real advocates for people to get them through the system,'' he said. ''There are too many people left on the vine.''
Mr. Menino has been faulted by some who say he lacks a big-picture vision and has not improved the schools quickly enough. He is sometimes made fun of for his malapropisms; he once said the city's parking shortage was ''an Alcatraz around my neck.''
But he has pushed several economic development projects and the city is financially healthy. Unemployment is 5.8 percent, lower than the state and national averages. Moody's recently called Boston ''the strongest commercial real estate market in the country since the 2008 recession.''
Asked to name the best thing he had done for Boston, Mr. Menino pointed both hands at himself. ''Me becoming mayor!'' he laughed.
More seriously, he said, ''my No. 1 thing is bringing racial harmony to the city.'' Referring to the bitter battles in the 1970s over school busing, he added, ''We don't have the nonsense that we used to have because I don't tolerate it.''
On Election Day, although he was in the hospital, Mr. Menino's political machine helped pull out the vote for Elizabeth Warren in her Senate race, producing the highest turnout in Boston since 1964 -- and sending a shot across the bow of anyone thinking about challenging him next year.
But voters may not be as hesitant as politicians to pronounce the end of the Menino era. In random interviews in Dorchester the other day, many residents praised the mayor but said he should step aside.
''He's cleaned up the city, and people see him as a fair person when it comes to race,'' said Anthony Senna, 53, a chef who grew up in Roxbury and was picking up coffee at Dunkin' Donuts. ''But he's been there so, so long. People age differently, but I think it's time for new blood.''

HEADLINE: With a Supermajority, California Democrats Begin to Make Plans

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- The Democratic Party has controlled the California Legislature for a nearly unbroken stretch of 42 years. Yet control goes only so far: it takes two-thirds of the Legislature to enact a host of important legislation in this state, meaning that even the diminished Republican Party has been able to easily frustrate Democratic ambitions.
But with a swell of electoral victories in November, the Democratic Party has now crossed that boundary and controls two-thirds of both the Senate and the Assembly, giving it the kind of unfettered power that no party has had here for 80 years.
This does not appear to be a passing advantage. Even Republicans say that changes in electoral demographics mean that, with the exception of a few brief lapses caused by vacancies, Democrats could hold a supermajority at least through the end of the decade. 
Yet in the ''be careful what you wish for'' department, Democrats are beginning to confront the struggles and complications that come with being in charge of the store. This authority came at least two years earlier than most Democrats had projected. And it is unleashing years of pent-up Democratic desires -- to roll back spending cuts, approve a bond issue to rebuild the state's water system, amend the state's tax code, revamp California's governance system -- that had been largely checked by the Republican minority.
At the same time, it is stirring concerns from Democrats, among them Gov. Jerry Brown, that the situation may inspire an overreach that could make the party's reign brief. By contrast, some Democrats argue that handled correctly, the next two years could provide an opportunity to lock in long-term control.
''The center of gravity of the Democratic Party will be restraint, but some people can't help themselves,'' Mr. Brown said in an interview. ''The supermajority is not a permanent condition. It's something that can be lost far more easily than it can be gained.''
The demand became apparent even before the new Legislature was sworn in this month. State Senator Ted W. Lieu, a Democrat, proposed reinstating an automobile registration fee that was repealed under Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger. That fee was a rallying point of what many saw as excessive taxation here; its elimination created a $4 billion revenue shortfall. Mr. Lieu pulled back at the urging of Democratic leaders.
''Democrats have unrestricted, unchecked power in the executive and the legislative branch today -- and they have not had that for decades,'' said James L. Brulte, a former state lawmaker running for state Republican leader. ''If you are a Democrat, the good news is that your party is 100 percent in charge of state government. If you're a Democrat, the bad news is that you don't get to blame anybody else if things go wrong. So Democrats own it.''
Darrell Steinberg, the president pro tem of the Senate, said that he appreciated the risks and that Democrats would not overstep. Still, he said, this was a chance to address years of deep spending cuts and to put before voters measures to change a government and tax structure that analysts from both parties blame for much of California's paralysis.
''We get the overreach warning: we have heard it, and we acknowledge it,'' Mr. Steinberg told lawmakers at their swearing-in ceremony. ''But frankly, I think you can focus too much on overreach because there is an equally compelling danger. It is the danger of being so cautious, so worried about creating controversy, that we fail to take advantage of unprecedented opportunities.''
In a later interview, Mr. Steinberg added: ''There are a whole host of things that the two-thirds majority gives an opportunity to talk about. I believe in the two-party system. But are we prepared to use our supermajority if the Republicans choose not to participate? Yes.''
The Democratic ascension has arrived as California emerges -- if tentatively -- from a prolonged recession and government retrenchment. And it has come as lawmakers and outside analysts have increasingly come to view California's problems as a result of flaws with its governance.
This new authority comes with a markedly different Legislature, filled with dozens of first-time lawmakers, empowered by a change in term-limit laws that allow them to stay longer and develop areas of expertise, and elected under a nonpartisan election system intended to produce moderation and compromise.
It is hard to think of another state as solidly Democratic, after an election that left Republicans relegated to the sidelines.
''A supermajority is problematic for California,'' said Connie Conway, the Assembly Republican leader. ''I hope voters understand what they've done. I expect a full-out assault on the taxpayers of California.''
Under California law, a two-thirds vote is required to put initiatives before voters to change the State Constitution or raise taxes. That requirement is an outgrowth of Proposition 13, the property tax reduction initiative passed in 1978.
Many Democrats said a top priority was figuring out a way to remove deep spending cuts made to education and other state services, which could mean finding new revenue.
''We do need to take stock,'' said Ellen M. Corbett, the Senate Democratic leader. ''We do need to take a look at things we have cut that may impact our ability to grow the economy.''
Senator Mark Leno, a Democrat, proposed putting on the ballot an initiative that would allow school districts and cities to pass a parcel tax increase with 55 percent of voters, down from the two-thirds requirement in Proposition 13. Lawmakers said they were also reviewing business tax exemptions they agreed to in order to win Republican votes.
Another Democrat, Assemblywoman Nancy Skinner, said, ''What we want is to look carefully to see what kind of tax do we have like that, that are costing our schools, costing our taxpayers and not benefiting our economy.''
Proposition 13 has long been blamed for California's financial turmoil and inequitable tax system, but its political popularity has made lawmakers wary of touching it.
Now that the Democrats have a supermajority, there has been a growing call for lawmakers to put an initiative before voters to revise Proposition 13, either by eliminating the two-thirds requirement or creating a split tax roll, which would protect residential property owners but remove protection from commercial and industrial properties.
''It's Time to Adjust Prop 13,'' said the headline over a column by George Skelton in The Los Angeles Times on Thursday.
Mr. Brown recoiled at the suggestion.''There's a lot of talk about that,'' Mr. Brown said. ''With water, energy, school funding formulas, higher education, the whole implementing of Obama health care, we have lots on our plate. With these kind of hot-button issues, I'd be very surprised if there were any serious attempt to deal with them in the near term.''
This new Democratic dominance is also not necessarily good news for the state's Democratic governor. He no longer has the foil of the Republican minority. And Mr. Brown, whose fiscally moderate views have at times clashed with those of his Democratic colleagues, now faces something he has not faced before: a Legislature with enough votes to override him.

HEADLINE: U.S. Fiscal Deal Unlikely Without Compromise

BYLINE: By ALBERT R. HUNT | BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As many Republicans reject higher tax rates for wealthier Americans, Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, urges them to continue to resist, claiming that the economic boom of the 1990s and the resulting budget surplus were due to his leadership in Congress and not to President Bill Clinton's early tax increases.
All economic indicators were heading downward before he became speaker, Mr. Gingrich said on the NBC television show ''Meet the Press'' on Dec. 9, and ''virtually all the economic growth occurs after Republicans take control'' of the House in 1995. The budget was balanced late in the decade because of the tax cut he engineered in 1997, he said. 
To paraphrase the late Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Mr. Gingrich is entitled to his opinion, but not to his own facts.
The arguments against higher taxes today and those used by Mr. Gingrich and his allies against the Clinton tax increase in 1993 are strikingly similar: They will destroy jobs and devastate economic growth, without cutting the deficit.
The facts: The Clinton tax increase on upper incomes, which brought the top rate to 39.6 percent, as President Barack Obama wants to do now, was enacted Aug. 6, 1993. Over the next 18 months, the U.S. economy grew at a rate of about 4 percent; unemployment dropped sharply, to 6 percent from 7.6 percent. The stock market rose moderately.
Deficits immediately began to narrow, shrinking to $22 billion in 1997 from $255 billion in 1993. In late 1997, a small tax cut that included a reduction in capital-gains levies and a child credit was passed, though the much larger tax increases enacted four years earlier were left largely untouched. The budget situation continued to improve, moving to surpluses over the next four years. Most economists credit this result to the climate of the decade, which Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, and others said had been prompted by the 1993 legislation's bolstering of consumer and investor confidence.
Now the Republican pursuit of lower marginal tax rates for the more affluent defies at least political reality. Polls show strong support for Mr. Obama's position on the top rate.
Eliminating the George W. Bush-era tax cuts for upper-income Americans, taking the top rate to 39.6 percent, along with the accompanying changes on some deductions and exemptions, would raise about $600 billion in a decade.
During the presidential campaign, the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, floated the notion of capping deductions at $50,000 a year; that would raise less than $500 billion if, as would seem certain, it excluded charitable contributions; there would be other controversies, and it would hit middle-class taxpayers.
There are significant other tax elements apart from the rates. Some compromises will be necessary on scheduled increases in levies on dividends and capital gains. On the estate tax, although it goes exclusively to the rich, some Senate Democrats, like Max Baucus of Montana and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana, favor a more generous break.
As the political tension mounts over the current fiscal deadlock -- which, unless a deal is reached by Dec. 31, would increase taxes for everyone and force some draconian spending cuts -- there will have to be trade-offs for any ultimate deficit-reduction deal. Congressional Republicans insist this will only be palatable if there are major cuts to entitlement programs, especially Medicare.
There are clear indications that the White House, despite the objections of some Democrats, would go along with significant changes, perhaps including a form of means testing for Medicare benefits, altering the cost-of-living adjustments for entitlements and taxes.
None of that will fly politically unless it is accompanied by significant revenue increases. Initially, Mr. Obama wanted $1.6 trillion over 10 years; he has pulled back to $1.4 trillion. If he gets an amount in excess of $1 trillion -- which would require additional measures beyond ending the Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy -- a substantive deal on entitlements becomes more palatable.
Even if the current standoff over taxes and spending is resolved in the next two weeks, things are going to get messy early next year. Republicans are intent on using the need to increase the debt ceiling as leverage to force the White House to accept entitlement cuts; Mr. Obama is adamant that he won't play Russian roulette with the debt ceiling again, a reference to last year's market-rattling last-minute deal.
The only way to avoid that face-off is to devise some sort of enforcement mechanism before New Year's Eve that would mandate action on entitlements and increased revenue next year. The test for the president in his second term is to get a deal that is market-credible, inspiring consumer and investor confidence.
The shorter-term test for the Republicans, as some operatives, like the former Mississippi governor Haley Barbour realize, is to move away from the issue of rates for the wealthy. One of the party's liabilities in the 2012 elections was that it was seen as a protector of the privileged. Threatening a fiscal meltdown to protect lower tax rates for millionaires isn't a corrective.

HEADLINE: Japan Election Returns Power To Old Guard

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER; Makiko Inoue contributed reporting from Kawagoe, Japan.

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japan's voters handed a landslide victory to the Liberal Democratic Party in national parliamentary elections on Sunday, giving power back to the conservative party that had governed Japan for decades until a historic defeat three years ago.
In a chaotic election crowded with new parties making sweeping promises, from abolishing nuclear power after the Fukushima accident to creating an American-style federal system, the Liberal Democrats prevailed with their less radical vision of reviving the recession-bound economy and standing up to China. A victory would all but ensure that the Liberal Democratic leader, Shinzo Abe, a former prime minister who is one Japan's most outspoken nationalists, would be able to form a new government.
Some here saw the victory pointing to a greater willingness by this long pacifist nation to accept Mr. Abe's calls for a stronger military at a time when Japan faces an intensifying showdown with China over disputed islands. 
However, the dominant view of Sunday's vote was that it was not so much a weakening of Japan's desire for drastic change, or a swing to an anti-Chinese right, as a rebuke of the incumbent Democrats. They swept aside the Liberal Democrats with bold vows to overhaul Japan's sclerotic postwar order, only to disappoint voters by failing to deliver on economic improvements. Mr. Abe acknowledged as much, saying that his party had simply ridden a wave of public disgust in the failures of his opponents.
''We recognize that this was not a restoration of confidence in the Liberal Democratic Party, but a rejection of three years of incompetent rule by the Democratic Party,'' Mr. Abe, 58, told reporters. Now, his party will be left to address deepening public frustration on a host of issues, including a contracting economy and a teetering pension system.
In the powerful lower house, the Liberal Democrats held a commanding lead with 294 of the 480 seats up for grabs. That would be almost a mirror image of the results in 2009, when the Democrats won 308 seats.
In the current election, a dozen parties fielded a total of 1,504 candidates, the largest number ever. But in a sign of the election's failure to excite, only 59 percent of voters cast ballots, one of the lowest turnouts on record.
The Democrats suffered a crushing defeat, with just 57 seats, putting them only four seats ahead of the largest new party, the Japan Restoration Party, started by Osaka's popular mayor. It was a huge setback for the Democrats, whose landmark victory three years ago ended the Liberal Democrats' virtual one-party monopoly on power, and seemed to herald the start of a competitive two-party democracy.
Taking responsibility for the loss, Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda resigned as head of the Democratic Party, despite holding on to to his own seat in Chiba, outside Tokyo.
''We failed to meet the people's hopes after the change of government three years and four months ago,'' he told reporters.
In a sign of how far the pendulum had swung against the incumbents, former Prime Minister Naoto Kan lost his seat in a Tokyo suburb in a tight race with a relatively unknown Liberal Democratic challenger. Other prominent party members also lost their seats in what party members conceded was a rout.
''We tried the Democratic Party for three years, and it was a total disaster,'' said Hideyuki Takizawa, 52, a stockbroker voting in the Tokyo suburb of Kawagoe. He said that in the last election he voted for the Democrats, but that this time he opted for the Liberal Democrats. ''I have higher hopes now in the Liberal Democratic Party, especially in foreign affairs,'' he said.
The victorious Liberal Democrats take over a nation that faces deepening problems, including a ballooning national debt, a growing trade deficit and a rapidly aging population. Upon declaring victory, Mr. Abe quickly vowed to help the faltering economy by quickly passing a huge new stimulus spending bill, and called ending deflation his top priority. He also vowed to give relief to the nation's beleaguered export sector with more aggressive steps to drive down the yen to make Japanese products cheaper abroad.
There have been concerns that the hawkish Mr. Abe may provoke China by taking a firmer stand against that nation's increasingly assertive claims to disputed islands, known as the Senkakus in Japan and the Diaoyu in Chinese. But after the victory, he vowed to also move quickly to improve ties with China, Japan's largest trading partner.
''Our goal is to stop China from making these challenges,'' Mr. Abe said, ''but we do not intend to allow an overall worsening in relations.'' Party members said that even before the election, Mr. Abe's camp had been quietly reaching out to Beijing to ease tensions.
He also said he would mend ties with the United States, which grew strained when the first Democratic prime minister, Yukio Hatoyama, clashed with Washington over an American air base off Okinawa. Mr. Abe has said his first trip abroad as prime minister will be to Washington.
Another challenge will be energy policy, with all but two of Japan's 50 functional nuclear reactors shut down after the meltdown at the Fukushima complex early last year. Mr. Abe's pro-nuclear party will likely try to restart more of those idled reactors, and scrap the incumbents' plans to shut down most of the nation's nuclear plants by the 2030s.
One reason for the size of the victory was the failure of new parties to convince voters that they were viable alternatives. One of the biggest losers was the Tomorrow Party of Japan, which was formed late last month to ride a wave of antinuclear sentiment after the Fukushima accident but fizzled amid concerns that electrical shortages could hurt the already shrinking economy.
The Liberal Democrats even won most of the seats in Fukushima itself, where 160,000 remain homeless because of radioactive fallout, in an apparent protest vote against the incumbents' botched handling of the accident.
The Japan Restoration, started in September by Osaka's brash 43-year-old mayor, Toru Hashimoto, had hoped to become the second-largest party by winning younger voters with its promises of decisive leadership and a curtailment of Tokyo's powers by creating more autonomous, American-style states. While the party came close to its goal, it seemed to lose some of its momentum after joining forces with the aging, ultranationalistic governor of Tokyo, Shintaro Ishihara, whom many young voters view as a reactionary.
In interviews, voters said they had voted for the Liberal Democrats because they felt the party was the only choice. Many analysts warned that meant public opinion could just as easily swing again against the Liberal Democrats if they pursued unpopular steps, such as trying to rewrite the antiwar Constitution to allow a full-fledged military, something Mr. Abe has vowed to do.
''This is a landslide without a mandate,'' said Satoshi Machidori, a political scientist at Kyoto University. ''Mr. Abe shouldn't view this as a carte blanche to do as he pleases.''
Indeed, recent polls have shown only limited support for Mr. Abe. Voters said one worry was whether he would quit again if things got tough, as he is perceived as having done the last time he was prime minister, in 2007, when he complained of an intestinal ailment soon after his party was defeated in upper house elections.
''Abe-san threw the job away once already,'' said Yukako Sakamoto, 41, an office clerk who also voted in Kawagoe. ''Will he just run away again if the going gets rough in the Senkakus?''

HEADLINE: Michigan Efforts Shows G.O.P. Sway in State Contests

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE and MONICA DAVEY

 BODY:
As Republican leaders in Washington grappled after the election with their failure to unseat President Obama, Dick DeVos, one of Michigan's wealthiest men, began dialing up state lawmakers in Lansing.
Although Mr. Obama won Michigan handily, Republicans had kept control of the Legislature. A union-backed ballot measure to enshrine collective bargaining rights in the State Constitution was defeated, thanks to an aggressive campaign against it that was financed in part by $2 million of DeVos family money.
The time had come, Mr. DeVos told Republican lawmakers, for the bold stroke they were considering: a law banning requirements that workers pay union dues or fees, in the state where the modern American labor movement was born. If the lawmakers later found themselves facing recalls or tough re-election fights, Mr. DeVos told them, he would be there to help.
''That was when I started to say, you know what, this thing could happen,'' Mr. DeVos said on Friday. ''These people really are serious and committed.'' 
The lawmakers and Gov. Rick Snyder, who is also a Republican, rapidly approved the legislation and delivered a body blow to the labor movement.
Yet much of the groundwork for the quick victory was laid months and years before by a loose network of donors, strategists and conservative political groups that has sought to win Republican control of legislatures around the country and limit unions' political power. Their bet: that money invested in local elections would yield concrete policy victories that could not be had in Washington.
Where the big-spending conservative groups active in this year's presidential race had little to show for their millions of dollars, the state efforts were strikingly successful. While Mr. Obama was winning onetime red states like Virginia and swing states like Michigan and Ohio, Republicans made large gains in state offices in many of the same battlegrounds. Starting next year, Republicans will have one-party control in almost half of the state capitals in the country.
In Michigan, the drive to ban mandatory union payments, known by supporters as ''right to work,'' included national conservative groups like Americans for Prosperity, founded by the philanthropists David and Charles Koch, and a potent coalition of local business groups and donors led by Mr. DeVos, whose billionaire father, Richard DeVos Sr., a founder of Amway, has attended the Kochs' twice-yearly gatherings of conservative donors and leaders.
The DeVos family contributed more than $1 million to the state Republican Party this year, about a third of all its donations. When unions sought the constitutional amendment that would have guaranteed their right to bargain, known as Proposal 2, the DeVos family gave at least $2 million to a committee fighting the effort. The casino mogul Sheldon Adelson contributed another $2 million. Harold Simmons, a Texas industrialist, gave $500,000.
When the union-backed referendum was defeated, the Michigan Freedom Fund, a group run by an employee of a DeVos family company, started a $1 million advertising campaign to support the legislation banning mandatory union payments. Americans for Prosperity, which set up a local chapter in Michigan five years ago and held several conferences for advocates this year, deployed volunteers to make thousands of phone calls around the state, pressing Michigan residents to call lawmakers.
''The air cover helped lawmakers do what they wanted to do,'' said Jase Bolger, a Republican who is the speaker of the Michigan House of Representatives. ''There was a lot of caution in starting.''
The effort duplicated other recent successes in the Midwest, where conservatives have seized on the struggling economy and population loss to push for smaller state budgets, lower taxes and laws limiting unions. In Indiana, where Democrats lost their majority in the State House of Representatives after the 2010 election, Republicans enacted the region's first right-to-work law early this year.
In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker, backed by groups like Americans for Prosperity, signed into law limits on collective bargaining and survived a recall effort in June, drawing large contributions from Mr. DeVos, Mr. Adelson and Bob Perry, a Texas homebuilder and ''super PAC'' donor.
Voters in the region have ''seen economic liberalism in its full maturity, and they haven't necessarily liked what they were seeing,'' said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity.
Union leaders, who poured millions of dollars into the Michigan battle, suggested that Republicans had succeeded in passing anti-union bills only through stealth. Mr. Walker and Mr. Snyder shied away from the issue during their own campaigns, the leaders said, and then rushed bills through with little notice. In Ohio, they noted, voters last year overturned by referendum a new state law restricting collective bargaining rights.
''The anti-union modus operandi has been deception, plain and simple,'' said Chris Policano, a spokesman for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.
Many of the same donors and strategists behind the Republicans' robust network of super PACs have also, with less fanfare, been financing efforts to elect Republican state lawmakers. Three years ago, Ed Gillespie, a former Republican national chairman, took over a little-known group, the Republican State Leadership Committee, hoping to increase the party's control of statehouses and ensure it a favorable position for Congressional redistricting.
Working closely with American Crossroads, the super PAC founded by the Republican strategist Karl Rove, Mr. Gillespie has raised almost $60 million, mostly from corporations. Wealthy conservatives have also contributed, like Mr. Perry and John Templeton, a Philadelphia philanthropist who also gave $100,000 to the Michigan referendum campaign.
The group has spent more than $1.6 million in Michigan, helping Republicans win the House in 2010 and defend their majority in 2012. Today, Mr. Bolger, the House speaker, leads the committee's caucus of state lawmakers.
Similar organizations run by the Democratic Party have raised substantially less money in recent years. Wealthy donors like Tim Gill, a Colorado software entrepreneur whose millions have helped defeat state lawmakers opposed to gay rights, have worked to elect Democrats at the state level. But they have been less apt to work in concert across the country.
Others are occupied with other political battles. Jon Stryker, a Michigan billionaire who has long been a major patron of the state's Democratic Party, contributed no money to the fight for Proposal 2.
Even so, it took the election two years ago of Mr. Snyder, a wealthy former technology executive, to open the door to a major policy change in the state. At a gathering of Tea Party activists this year, Ron Weiser, a former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party who has worked with Mr. DeVos, said Republicans had long pondered introducing right-to-work legislation but had been encouraged to wait until the state had a Republican governor. (A video of the remarks was later posted on YouTube by Michigan Democrats.)
''Now we have a legislature,'' said Mr. Weiser, who is now the national finance chairman of the Republican National Committee. ''And we have a governor.''
Mr. Snyder, too, was helped by national outside groups. In 2010, the Republican Governors Association sponsored $3.5 million worth of television commercials promoting Mr. Snyder and set up a Michigan affiliate that gave $5.2 million to the Michigan Republican Party.
The spending appeared to be part of a money swap that was engineered by the governors' association, according to Rich Robinson of the Michigan Campaign Finance Network, a watchdog organization. The spending by the group almost exactly equaled the amount contributed to it by Michigan donors, replacing money that largely came from Michigan corporate donors and could not legally be given to Michigan candidates with funds from wealthy out-of-state contributors, such as Mr. Perry and David Koch.
When elected, Mr. Snyder moved quickly to overhaul Michigan's tax code and to balance the budget. Yet for months, he urged fellow Republicans not to pick a battle over legislation outlawing required union fees.
That changed, lawmakers said, after the unions lost on Proposal 2. Mr. Snyder edged closer to the idea, and at a meeting early this month, ''he agreed the debate was on his agenda,'' Mr. Bolger said.
Mr. Snyder also spoke before the election with Mr. DeVos.
''I was encouraging the governor to get personally more engaged in Proposal 2,'' Mr. DeVos said. ''That we really needed him out helping us on that initiative.''
Asked about the influence of Mr. DeVos and others, Sara Wurfel, a spokeswoman for Mr. Snyder, said of the governor: ''He is interested in hearing what people think, and he was hearing from everyone all the time. But ultimately what he decides to do is what he thinks is the right public policy decision.''
Mr. DeVos said he had not spoken to the governor since the election, although he was invited to holiday parties at the governor's residence, held the week Mr. Snyder announced he would support the bill banning mandatory contributions to unions.
Mr. DeVos said he had a scheduling conflict. ''I really owe him a call to congratulate him,'' he said, ''and thank him for stepping up and doing the right thing.''

HEADLINE: Big Decision on Afghanistan

 BODY:
One only has to read the Pentagon's progress report on the Afghanistan war effort released last Monday to understand how pointless it is to keep 68,000 American troops there any longer. The mounting evidence makes it clear that they should be pulled out as soon as it can be done safely, instead of waiting until the end of 2014, the date set by the United States and NATO. 
Yet the White House is now signaling that the decision on how quickly they will come home will not be made before next year.
The United States has spent a decade and $39 billion to recruit, train and equip a 350,000-member Afghan security force, including the army and police, that is supposed to defend the country when the Americans leave. President George W. Bush gave the effort short shrift when he shifted focus to Iraq. But even after President Obama's considerable investment, the Pentagon says that only one of the Afghan National Army's 23 brigades is able to operate independently, without air or other military support from the United States and NATO.
Although the report said Afghan forces are ''increasingly taking over responsibility for securing Afghanistan,'' that doesn't mean keeping troops there will do anything but delay the inevitable. According to the American timetable, the Afghans are supposed to lead all operations by June 2013, just six months away. Even getting them ready to take over by the end of 2014 will be a challenge, a Pentagon official said at a briefing.
The problems are deep rooted, and unlikely to be solved in the next half-year. Most recruits are illiterate and have to be taught to read, in addition to martial skills. The units still depend heavily on the Americans for critical components of modern warfare -- air power, communications, intelligence gathering, logistics and leadership. A Congressional study issued in September said that 20 percent of the troops are still deserting the army, and units typically are at only half their authorized strength. Problems with the police, where corruption is rampant, are worse.
The additional ''surge'' of 33,000 American troops in 2009 to drive the Taliban from their southern stronghold to the negotiating table weakened the extremists. But they remain ''adaptive and determined'' and able to conduct ''isolated high-profile attacks,'' the report said. Negotiations have gotten nowhere.
Meanwhile, the government of President Hamid Karzai is rife with corruption and unable to deliver basic services to its people. There is also a lack of coordination between Kabul and the provinces and an uneven distribution of power among the judicial, legislative and executive branches, the report said.
The United States has made mistakes in Afghanistan. but it has also afforded the Afghans a chance to build a better state. Commitments by the Obama administration and European allies to provide billions of dollars to support the security forces and finance economic development projects should be kept as long as they seem useful. But Mr. Obama should overrule any plan from the military commanders to keep most of the 68,000 troops there through 2014.

HEADLINE: Before Facebook Deal, Instagram's Talks With Twitter

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: Instagram's founders had talks with top Twitter executives as late as March, verbally agreeing to a price for the photo-sharing service, according to a New York Times report. | The American International Group is preparing to end its longtime association with the Asian insurer AIA Group. | Argentina is still fighting over defaulted bonds, but it's at least getting a naval ship back. | Sidney Gilman, the Alzheimer's researcher at the center of an insider trading case, lived a double life. 

 BODY:
 BEFORE FACEBOOK DEAL, INSTAGRAM'S TALKS WITH TWITTER | Facebook's deal to buy Instagram for $1 billion stunned Wall Street and Silicon Valley when it was announced in April. But executives at Twitter had an additional reason to be surprised. Instagram's founders "held several meetings as late as March with top Twitter executives," The New York Times's Nick Bilton reports. "The sides had verbally agreed weeks earlier on a price for Instagram of $525 million in cash and Twitter shares," Mr. Bilton reports, citing people on both sides of the talks, who requested anonymity because the talks were private and because they were concerned about legal repercussions.
That would appear to contradict statements that Instagram's chief executive, Kevin Systrom, made under oath, according to Mr. Bilton. Mr. Systrom testified in August at a hearing of the California Corporations Department that his company "never received any offers" at the time of the negotiations with Facebook. Instagram, he said, "talked to other parties, but never received any formal offers from anybody else." 
But when the deal was announced, Twitter executives were "shocked that they had not been given an opportunity to present a counteroffer," Mr. Bilton reports. The people familiar with the negotiations "said Twitter was prepared to make higher offers." The Facebook deal closed at $735 million in early September, after Facebook's stock tumbled. Mr. Bilton writes: "It is possible investors would have been better off selling in an open auction, to Twitter or even to Google or Microsoft."
It's not yet clear how Instagram might make money, but some of its users have built businesses that piggyback on the photo-sharing service, The New York Times reports.
 A.I.G. PREPARES TO EXIT ASIAN INSURER | After becoming a fully private enterprise for the first time since 2008, the American International Group is now preparing to end its longtime association with the Asian insurer AIA Group. On Monday, A.I.G. said it was beginning a process to sell its 13.7 percent stake in AIA, valued at about $6.7 billion. Shares in AIA were suspended from trading in Hong Kong pending an announcement on the outcome of the sale process. Neil Gough of DealBook writes: "In the end, A.I.G. may sell only part of its stake. A.I.G said it would sell the shares to institutional investors and will use the proceeds from the deal for general corporate purposes." A.I.G. has been gradually reducing its stake in AIA since the Asian insurer was spun out in 2010.
ARGENTINE SHIP TO SAIL HOME | While Argentina remains locked in a fight with hedge funds over defaulted bonds, the government is at least getting its naval ship back. A United Nations court on Saturday ordered the immediate release of the Libertad, the Argentine ship that became a pawn in the legal battle when it was detained in Ghana in early October, The Financial Times reports. Elliott Management, one of the hedge funds trying to force Argentina to pay up on old bonds, had obtained a court order to detain the ship, leading to "one of the most spectacular and embarrassing" episodes in Argentina's years-long legal struggle.
 ON THE AGENDA | Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank, speaks at the quarterly hearing of the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee at 9:30 a.m. David Tepper of Appaloosa Management is on CNBC at 8 a.m. Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive of Pimco, is on CNBC at 3:10 p.m.
A DOCTOR'S DOUBLE LIFE | Sidney Gilman, the Alzheimer's researcher at the center of the insider trading case against a former employee of SAC Capital Advisors, "was living a parallel life, one in which he regularly advised a wide network of Wall Street traders through a professional matchmaking system," The New York Times writes. "The riddle for Dr. Gilman's longtime friends and colleagues is why a nationally respected neurologist was pulled into the high-rolling life of a consultant to financiers and how he, by his own admission, crossed the line into criminal behavior." This conversion was not readily apparent in Dr. Gilman's lifestyle in Michigan, but colleagues now say his story provides a cautionary tale for those in academic medicine.
With the latest insider trading cases, the government continues to circle near Steven A. Cohen, the founder of SAC Capital. E-mails that were made public in the trial against two former hedge fund managers suggest that Mr. Cohen may have been consulted on a questionable trade in Dell stock, Bloomberg News reports. "Guys, I was talking to Steve about Dell earlier today and he asked me to get the two of you to compare notes before the print, as we are on opposite sides of this one," Michael S. Steinberg, a longtime SAC portfolio manager, wrote to two others at the firm.

If rates fall, their old bonds are redeemed by the company, depriving them of the yield they expected."

 Tweet of the Week 
@myconfusedface
Facebook was down almost 20 minutes. For some, these were the most productive 20 minutes of the year.
 The Week's Bests 
 Thursday Bram says there's a side benefit to hiring an accountant who knows how to sell online: "In addition to getting help from someone who understands how your business functions and may have some ideas for growing it, an accountant who is up to date on technology will be a lot easier to work with. There are accountants out there who still require their clients to burn CDs of their bookkeeping data or, shudder, print out reports on actual paper."
 Bryan Janeczko shares his 2013 start-up trends, including domestic manufacturing: "With the advent of 3-D printing (on-demand manufacturing of basic household plastics and items from buttons to toasters), highly skilled labor, lower production costs, manufacturing in this country is superappealing. Businesses can customize more quickly and can provide superior customer experiences."
 This Week's Question: Who do you think offers the best insights into small business?
 Gene Marks owns the Marks Group , a Bala Cynwyd, Pa., consulting firm that helps clients with customer relationship management. You can follow him on Twitter.

HEADLINE: Guns and the Decline of the Young Man

BYLINE: CHRISTY WAMPOLE


HIGHLIGHT: Even if guns were to vanish, the specter that haunts our young men would still hover in silence, darkly. 

 BODY:
 2:05 p.m. | Updated 
 This post originally contained an article that was not ready for publication. The correct version appears below. 
Adam Lanza was a young man. Jacob Roberts was a young man. James Holmes is a young man. Seung-Hui Cho was a young man. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold were young men.
We can all name a dozen or so hypotheses about why they kill: their parents' unlocked gun cabinet, easy access to weapons on the Internet, over- or under-medication, violent video games and TV programs, undiagnosed or misdiagnosed mental disorders, abusive or indifferent parents, no stable social network, bullying. However, young women are equally exposed to many of the same conditions yet rarely turn a weapon on others. This leaves us wondering about the young men. 
There is something about life in the United States, it seems, that is conducive to young men planning and executing large-scale massacres. But the reasons elude us. 
The first reaction to the horror and bloodshed of a mass killing like the one in Newtown, Conn., is a rekindling of the gun control debate. I happen to believe, along with many others, that the repeated mandate we give to the National Rifle Association and its lobby, and the complacency with which we allow our politicians to be subject to the will of gun manufacturers is odious.
Limiting access to weapons is certainly a pragmatic albeit incomplete solution to the United States' propensity for murder. However, were the guns to vanish instantaneously, the specter that haunts our young men would still hover in silence, darkly.
What is it that touches them?
I come from a small town near Fort Worth, Texas. In this region, like many others across the United States, young men are having a very hard time of it. When I consider how all of the people I knew there are faring, including my own family members, the women have come out considerably better than the men. While many of the women were pregnant in high school and have struggled with abusive relationships, financial hardships and addictions, they've often found ways to make their lives work, at least provisionally, and to live with their children if not provide for them in more substantial ways. 
The same cannot be said for many young men in the region, who are often absent fathers of multiple children by multiple women, unemployed or underemployed, sullen and full of rage. While every woman in my family has done O.K. in the end, every man on one side of my family except for my grandfather has spent time in jail, abused drugs or alcohol, suffered from acute depression, or all of the above. Furthermore, pervasive methamphetamine use, alcoholism, physical and psychological abuse and severe depression have swept not only my hometown and my region but large segments of the United States. If this pattern is not familiar to you personally, I am certain it is the lived experience of someone you know.
This is merely anecdotal evidence, not social science, but I believe that it is indicative of a sort of infection spreading in our collective brain, one that whispers to the American subconscious: "The young men are in decline." They were once our heroes, our young and shining fathers, our sweet brothers, our tireless athletes, our fearless warriors, the brains of our institutions, the makers of our wares, the movers of our world. In the Western imagination, the valiance of symbolically charged figures like Homer's Ulysses or the Knights of the Round Table remained unquestioned since their conception. However, as centuries progressed and stable categories faltered, the hero figure faces increasing precarity. Even if we consider the 20th century alone, we see this shift from World War II, when the categories of good and evil were firm, to later conflicts like the wars in Vietnam and Iraq, involving a disparity between what the government believed to be right and what much of the civilian population did. 
Does the heroic young man still make sense today, or has his value already been depleted?
Certainly, there are young men who are paragons of success: the entrepreneurs of Silicon Valley, the sharply dressed bankers, the swarms of brilliant graduates who receive their diplomas each year. And there are heroes who fight our fires, soldiers who fight our wars and the first-responders who are the first to set eyes on the dead children's bodies at the scenes of mass shootings. But more young men these days are avatars of soldiers rather than soldiers themselves. 
If the soldier has largely been replaced by the video game character and the drone, if the mothers have proven that they can raise the children alone, if the corporations are less able or willing to guarantee the possibility of upward mobility and some level of respect that comes with title, if someone else can bring home the bacon, what is left for young men?
All this, and they still are not allowed to cry.
There is also the issue of race. Not all of the men I listed in the beginning of this piece are Caucasian. However, take a moment and imagine what the archetypical image of a mass murderer in the United States looks like. Is he white in your mind? This image can only be attributed to the truth of those patterns that have established themselves, from Charles Whitman's 1966 shooting spree at the University of Texas, to Timothy McVeigh's 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, to the 1999 Columbine massacre, to Wade Michael Page's 2012 attack on the Sikh temple in Wisconsin. The mass murderer is a type. And his race is white.
Young, African-American men are often imagined to be violent on the street, killing one another in gang-related violence or murdering convenience store clerks while trying to empty the cash register. The stereotypical image, even in its wrongheaded reduction of the black man to an inherently violent being, does not leave room for that other kind of murderer, the one who plans and executes a calculated, non-spontaneous large-scale death spree.
The angry white man has usurped the angry black man.
I would argue that maleness and whiteness are commodities in decline. And while those of us who are not male or white have enjoyed some benefits from their decline, the sort of violence and murder that took place at Sandy Hook Elementary will continue to occur if we do not find a way to carry them along with us in our successes rather than leaving them behind.
For women, things are looking up. We can vote, we can make more choices about our bodies than in decades past, we've made significant progress regarding fair pay, and more women are involved in American politics than ever before. The same can be said for minorities. However, because resources are limited, gains for women and minorities necessarily equal losses for white males. Even in this feels intuitively fair to many, including those white males who are happy to share resources for the greater benefit of the nation as a whole, it must feel absolutely distressing for those who are uncomfortable with change and who have a difficult time adjusting to the inevitable reordering of society. 
From the civil rights and feminist movements of the 1960s and onward, young men - and young white men in particular - have increasingly been asked to yield what they'd believed was securely theirs. This underlying fact, compounded by the backdrop of violent entertainment and easy access to weapons, creates the conditions for thousands of young men to consider their future prospects and decide they would rather destroy than create. 
Can you imagine being in the shoes of the one who feels his power slipping away? Who can find nothing stable to believe in? Who feels himself becoming unnecessary? That powerlessness and fear ties a dark knot in his stomach. As this knot thickens, a centripetal hatred moves inward toward the self as a centrifugal hatred is cast outward at others: his parents, his girlfriend, his boss, his classmates, society, life. 
A partial solution to these toxic circumstances could be a coordinated cultivation of what might be called an empathic habit. Most people surely felt an impulsive empathy for the parents and survivors involved in the Sandy Hook massacre, as shown by the countless memorial services and candlelight vigils that took place after the murders. But empathy could help best if exercised before rather than after such tragedies. 
Empathy could serve many of us: those who have not yet put themselves in the position of a person who is losing their power and those who can aim a gun at someone without imagining themselves on the other end of the barrel. For those of us who belong to a demographic that is doing increasingly better, a trained empathic reflex toward those we know to be losing for our gains could lead to a more deferential attitude on our part and could constitute an invitation for them to stay with us. To delight in their losses and aim at them the question, "How does it feel?" will only trigger a cycle of resentment and plant the seeds for vengeance. It is crucial to accommodate the pain of others. 
For a start, feeling needed is undoubtedly essential to each individual. This fact must be addressed at home, at school, in the workplace, and in politics. For example, one could envision the development of a school curriculum that centers around an empathic practice, particularly in courses such as history, social studies, literature, and political science. If students have no access to an empathic model at home, they would at least be exposed to it in the classroom. In the workplace, the C.E.O. must be able to put herself in the position of the lowest ranked employee and vice versa. Victims and victors must engage in the hypothetical practice that forces each to acknowledge the others' fortunes and misfortunes. 
Empathy is difficult because it forces us to feel the suffering of others. It is destabilizing to imagine that if we are lucky or blessed, it just as easily could have gone some other way. For the young men, whose position is in some ways more difficult than that of their fathers and grandfathers, life seems at times to have stacked the cards against them. It is for everyone to realize the capricious nature of history, which never bets consistently on one group over another. We should learn to cast ourselves simultaneously in the role of winner and loser, aggressor and victim. 
We have a choice whether our national refrain of "No more mass murders" will be meaningful or meaningless. We cannot neglect the young men. By becoming empathic stewards of civic and personal life, there is a chance we could make someone think twice before targeting another human being.

HIGHLIGHT: Jaguar is dropping its plans to build hybrid supercars based on the C-X75 concept. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 Jaguar is dropping its plans to build hybrid supercars based on the C-X75 concept. "After a thorough reassessment of near-term market conditions, the company's view is that the global economic landscape does not currently support the introduction of a supercar such as C-X75," Adrian Hallmark, Jaguar global brand director, said in a news release. In May 2011, the British luxury automaker said it would build 250 of the cars to ship in late 2013. The price was estimated at about $1.1 million. (CNN Money) 
 The last Lexus LFA has rolled off the assembly line, Toyota announced in a news release. The 500th Lexus supercar was completed on Friday in Motomachi, Japan. The car has been in production for two years and only one car was built each working day. Toyota says it may use what it has learned about plastic reinforced with carbon fiber in future vehicles. (Autoblog.com)
 As the global auto industry heads for a record year, Toyota is on the verge of reclaiming the title of world's biggest automaker, according to Bloomberg News. General Motors, which was the world leader in 2011, is in a race with Volkswagen for the No. 2 spot in 2012. Total sales around the world will top 80 million cars and trucks for the first time, according to estimates from LMC Automotive. (Bloomberg News)
 Chevrolet is donating 24 Chevy Express vans to Habitat to Humanity to aid the recovery efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy. The vans, which are leaving Atlanta on Monday and heading for New York and New Jersey, will also have tools donated by Lowe's and the Robert Bosch Tool Company. The donation will bring General Motors's contribution to Hurricane Sandy relief efforts to more than $2.8 million. (The Detroit News)

HEADLINE: A Real Right to Work

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: The country needs strong policies to create jobs, and public employment through increased government spending is the surest way to tackle the problem, an economist says. 

 BODY:
Nancy Folbre is an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. She recently edited and contributed to "For Love and Money: Care Provision in the United States." 
All Americans willing and able to work have a right to paid employment. If the private sector can't generate sufficient jobs, the public sector should provide them. 
This definition of "right to work" obviously differs from the one that Republican legislators in Michigan deployed when they passed a new law absolving workers from the responsibility of paying union fees even if they gain contract benefits from them. But perhaps their actions will dramatize the need to challenge their framing and reclaim the genuine meaning of the phrase. 
Most of us live in a world in which paid employment is the only avenue to economic self-sufficiency. Without it, families maintained by working-age adults are largely dependent on the kindness of strangers, otherwise known as extended unemployment insurance and food stamps. Yet, for more than four years, this nation has tolerated levels of unemployment that have essentially made it impossible for most of those seeking paid employment to find it, with a ratio of unemployed workers to job openings of more than three to one. 
Some Republicans have long insisted that many of the jobless, relaxing in a billowy social safety net, simply aren't trying hard enough to find a job. My fellow Economix contributor Casey Mulligan makes a similar argument when he contends that the poverty rate should have risen between 2007 and 2011, but didn't because public assistance was neutralizing the effect of job loss and undermining incentives to work.

But Shawn Fremstad of the Center for Economic Policy and Research challenges that methodology, pointing to measurements showing that the poverty rate did rise significantly among working-age adults over this period.
Further, increased unemployment contributed to economic stress across most of the social spectrum, not just among the poor and near poor. Between 2007 and 2011, average household income declined in all four bottom quintiles. 
Expansion of unemployment insurance and means-tested benefits are not the best solution to persistently high unemployment. As John Stuart Mill emphasized many years ago, those who are capable of supporting themselves should not rely on the habitual aid of others. But Mill went on to explain why such aid is sometimes necessary: 
Energy and self-dependence are, however, liable to be impaired by the absence of help, as well as by its excess. It is even more fatal to exertion to have no hope of succeeding by it, than to be assured of succeeding without it. When the condition of any one is so disastrous that his energies are paralyzed by discouragement, assistance is a tonic, not a sedative: it braces instead of deadening the active faculties. 
Paralysis by discouragement is a pretty good description of a growing segment of the United States population. In general, the higher the unemployment rate in a state, the higher the percentage of discouraged workers (those who did not search for work in the previous four weeks, for the specific reason that they believed no jobs were available for them) and the higher the percentage of marginally attached workers (those who did not search for work in the previous four weeks, for any reason). 
Labor force participation has declined significantly since the last recession began, especially among less-educated men. 
The best way to encourage American workers, increase family income and reduce public spending on unemployment insurance and food stamps is to create more jobs. The simplest way to create more jobs is to increase public-sector employment. The federal government could also invest in programs to encourage small businesses to hire workers to improve our aging physical infrastructure (including roads and bridges), our social infrastructure (including early childhood education and home services for the elderly) and our environmental sustainability (including improved energy efficiency and installation of the solar voltaic technologies that Germany now heavily relies upon). 
All these investments offer a high social rate of return that private businesses can't easily capture on their own. 
By contrast, there is no evidence that lower tax rates for the rich promote either job creation or economic growth (a detailed study on this topic by the Congressional Research Service was withdrawn as a direct result of Republican protest). 
President Obama and Congressional Democrats have called for more stimulus spending aimed at job creation, only to meet tremendous opposition from Republicans. Preoccupation with deficit reduction has crowded out discussion of job creation. Public employment grew steadily during the previous Bush administration. During the Obama administration, however, it has significantly declined. 
Now, it appears that any remaining concern with job creation may be thrown over the fiscal cliff. 
The next time someone with a comfortable paycheck tells you that American workers no longer have a work ethic, please explain to them that right now, there's not enough paid work to go around. 
Which is why we should fight for a real right to work.
