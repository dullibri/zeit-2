HEADLINE: WORLD SUMMIT FOR CHILDREN;
World Leaders Endorse Plan To Improve Lives of Children

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Leaders from more than 70 nations came together here today in an extraordinary show of concern for the world's poorest children. They adopted a declaration and a plan of action committing them to drastically improving the lives of those children.
The declaration of the World Summit for Children pledged the participating nations to work together in an effort to save the lives of at least a third of the 14 million infants who now die each year before the age of 5.
The summit leaders also agreed to seek to cut malnutrition among children in half by the year 2000, reduce the number of women dying in childbirth and provide clean water and primary education for all. 
''The children of the world are innocent, vulnerable and dependent,'' the declaration said. ''They are also curious, active and full of hope. Their time should be one of joy and peace, of playing, learning and growing. Their future should be shaped in harmony and cooperation. Their lives should mature, as they broaden their perspectives and gain new experience.''
''But for many children, the reality of childhood is altogether different,'' it said. [Excerpts, page A12.] The halls of the General Assembly reverberated during the day with lofty and often poignant language about the plight of children, not only in the most destitute countries of the world but also in urban communities in richer lands. $20 Billion Needed Despite the high level of concern expressed, none of the leaders attending the summit pledged fresh money to meet the cost of achieving the goals that experts said were likely to require an extra $20 billion a year for the rest of the decade.
''A better world for children is within our reach but, as many heads of state have pointed out today, it is too early to say whether it is within our grasp,'' Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, a co-chairman and a catalyst for convoking the conference, told the closing session. ''The real work starts now.''
The world leaders, including President Bush, were limited to four minutes each to allow everyone a chance to speak today. [Excerpts from leaders' addresses, page A13.] Mr. Bush, who had to give priority to the negotiations on reducing the budget deficit, flew back to Washington after speaking in the morning, and then returned late in the afternoon to resume meetings with other leaders who were in New York. He is to address the General Assembly Monday morning on world issues.
The traffic gridlock that some city officials said they feared never developed, although there were some slowdowns as limousines approached and left the United Nations area.
The summit meeting transformed the United Nations today. In keeping with the theme, children were everywhere. The choir of the United Nations School provided the arriving leaders with folk songs. Children in national costumes posed for pictures with the celebrities, and a large number of children were in the audience for the opening ceremonies.
The United Nations reported that 2,800 children a year die from whooping cough, 8,000 from measles, 4,000 from tetanus, 5,500 from malaria, 22,000 from diarrhea, and 12,000 from pneumonia - all deaths that are preventable.
''We are gathered to speak for the children of the earth,'' Mr. Bush said in his address. ''Let us affirm in this historic summit that these children can be saved when we live up to our responsibilities as a world community of adults, of parents.''
While most speakers spoke of the plight of children and the need to improve their lot, there were some unusual speeches raising political questions that had to be resolved first.
 
Communism's 'False Paradise'
President Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia used his speech to argue that Communist governments by their very nature had oppressed generations of people by telling them they were building what he called ''a false paradise'' for their children.
''A thousand times I have heard people defend their servitude to a hated regime by the argument they were doing it only for the children: to be able to feed them, to make it possible for them to study, to be able to afford vacations at the seaside with them,'' he said. But the result, he said, was that the oppression continued.
''How much evil has already been committed in the name of children?'' he asked.
President Havel said he wanted to add a paragraph to the declaration forbidding parents to ''lie, serve dictatorships, inform on others, bend one's back, be scared of dictators and betray one's friends in the name of the alleged interests of children.''
Several third world leaders warned that the plight of their countries' children often reflected developments beyond their control, including the adverse economic climate in the world, heavy foreign debts, intractable wars and despotic, undemocratic regimes.
 
Debt and the Environment
President Abdou Diouf of Senegal said, ''All seem to agree a solution can't be found to these problems without a solution to the debt crisis.'' He added that the time has come ''for radical measures'' including the cancellation of all bilateral debts.
Zimbabwe's President, Robert G. Mugabe, warned that even if the money could be found to carry out the summit's goals, ''there may be little we can do unless the environment is correct.'' He said he was thinking of strife-ridden countries like Mozambique and Angola, where spending more aid on children will accomplish little until the fighting stops.
President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda said the fundamental reason why so many African children are dying is ''the prevalence of authoritarian, top-down styles of government'' and ''the oppression of man by man.''
 
Overpopulation Deplored
Many leaders argued that raising the living standards of third world children is likely to depend in the end on reducing rates of population growth in developing countries and protecting the environment.
''Overpopulation leads to poverty inconsistent with human dignity,'' said West German President Richard von Weizsacker.
But in a message to the summit, Pope John Paul II reaffirmed the Roman Catholic Church's hostility to birth control.
Other ambitious goals to which the leaders set their signature today include universal access for children to safe water and primary education by the end of the century, as well as eradicating poliomyelitis and neonatal tetanus and insuring that no more than 10 percent of the world's babies are under weight at birth.
 
Bush Doesn't Sign Declaration
Mr. Bush disappointed the summit's organizers by skipping Saturday night's dinner and making only a token appearance at today's opening session before racing back to Washington for the culmination of his budget meetings with Congressional leaders.
The President did not sign the final declaration and action plan or a new Convention on the Rights of the Child, approved by the United Nations General Assembly last year. The Convention lays down international norms for the protection of children that governments are bound to observe.
Some American conservative groups have attacked the convention because it does not outlaw abortion while banning the execution of those under 18.

HEADLINE: WORLD SUMMIT FOR CHILDREN;
SOVIETS FORGE TIE WITH SOUTH KOREA

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 30

 BODY:
The Soviet Union established diplomatic relations with South Korea today, culminating a series of steps that began in June when the South Korean President, Roh Tae Woo, met with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev in San Francisco.
Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union issued a joint announcement today with the South Korean Foreign Minister, Choi Ho Joong, after they met at the United Nations.
Earlier, Mr. Shevardnadze met with Israel's Foreign Minister, David Levy, and they issued a statement upgrading the relations between Israel and the Soviet Union.
The Soviet-Israeli move, stationing consuls general in both countries, falls short of formal diplomatic relations but brings ties a step closer than their present status, under which missions are maintained in both countries. The move follows a series of steps taken in the last year, including the granting of exit visas to thousands of Soviet Jews to emigrate to Israel. 
''This forms a new, direct and official framework for our bilateral relations,'' said Mr. Levy. ''This development can be seen as the end of an anomaly in our relations, and as a significant step towards full diplomatic relations.''
 
The Economic Factor
The Soviet move to establish diplomatic relations with South Korea, although it was expected following the June 4 meeting between Mr. Roh and Mr. Gorbachev, is likely to upset the North Koreans, who expressed dismay after the earlier meeting.
The establishment of relations with Seoul will permit Moscow to take advantage of South Korea's robust economy at a time of severe shortages in the Soviet Union, although the South Koreans said the issue of economic cooperation was not raised today.
A Soviet delegation is due in Seoul next month to discuss ''economic matters,'' Mr. Choi said.
North Korea has recently taken steps to improve relations with South Korea. The North Korean Government has also agreed to begin negotiations with the Japanese on normalizing relations.
The Soviet decision to establish diplomatic relations with South Korea was a major achievement for the South Koreans, who have sought to gain worldwide recognition of their accomplishments.
 
Middle East Issues
Mr. Shevardnadze met with the Israeli Foreign Minister for an hour in the chambers of the United Nations Security Council president, the rotating post held this month by Soviet Union.
During the discussion, the Soviet Foreign Minister said he raised the ''issue of peace and security in the Middle East.''
Soviet officials said they expected to have further meetings with the Israelis about the Middle East peace process once the new consular missions are opened in Tel Aviv and Moscow in about 10 days.
The Israeli mission now in Moscow has been very busy issuing visas to would-be emigrants.
The Soviets cut off diplomatic relations following the 1967 war between Israel and its Arab neighbors, and have always insisted that full relations could not be restored until Israel showed a willingness to settle issues with the Palestinians.
 
'Great Satisfaction'
''There is great satisfaction here,'' said Yuval Rotem, the spokesman for the Israeli U.N. mission. ''We have waited a long time for this.''
The Soviet Foreign Minister said he would consider a request by Mr. Levy to institute direct flights for Soviet Jews to Israel.
''We will return to that in the future,'' Mr. Shevardnadze said. The Soviets told Mr. Levy that they would like to see Israel join an international peace conference to settle the conflict between Israel and its Arab neighbors, Israeli diplomats said.
''Foreign Minister Levy explained at length Israel's opposition to an international peace conference,'' an Israeli diplomat said, ''and reiterated Israel's longstanding call for direct bilateral negotiations with the Arab countries.''
 
Exchange of Visits
Mr. Shevardnadze met later in the day with Mr. Choi.
He said he invited the South Korean official to visit the Soviet Union, and had been invited by Mr. Choi to visit South Korea.
''There will be an exchange of visits at high levels, including the summit level,'' the Soviet Foreign Minister said shortly after signing the agreement to establish diplomatic relations, ''but it is for the Presidents to decide when.''
The establishment of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union appears to make it possible for the South Koreans to take a seat in the United Nations. The five permanent members of the Security Council must all approve admission of a new member. The Chinese, who do not have diplomatic relations with South Korea, have also improved their ties in recent years, and are unlikely to object.
South Korea will continue talks with North Korea to determine how they will increase mutual cooperation and resolve the issue of seating at the United Nations, Mr. Choi said.
 
South More Populous
There are about 43,000 American troops in South Korea, although there are plans to cut this number to about 8,000 over the next three years.
South Korea has 43 million people and North Korea has a population of 20 million.
North Korea has called for a single Korean delegate to the United Nations, an idea the South Korean Foreign Minister dismissed as ''impossible.''
He said that the issue of United Nations representation and cooperation would be discussed by the Prime Ministers from North and South Korea on Oct. 16 in North Korea.
''We will try to convince North Korea to change their basic position and join with us in the United Nations,'' he said. ''We have the good example of Yemen and Germany. They have been members of the U.N. together, separately, but they achieved unification.''
Mr. Choi said that the agreement with the Soviets ''would bring some favorable results in our efforts to normalize relations with China.''
South Korea has established ties with many of North Korea's closest allies this year, including Algeria.

HEADLINE: ACCORD TO REDUCE SPENDING AND RAISE TAXES IS REACHED; MANY IN CONGRESS CRITICAL;
And the Victor Is: Bush?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
It was an unhappy looking group that assembled in the Rose Garden this afternoon. In the politics of the moment, the budget deal does not give any of them, President Bush or the Congressional leaders, a winning hand.
A central question, though, is who will win politically in the longer term. The answer may well be the President. 
Already today, he was taking a pounding from his right flank for losing his fight for a capital gains tax cut and renouncing his ''no new taxes'' pledge to the tune of $134 billion over five years. This may continue for weeks or even months.
 
Deflecting the Blame
But Mr. Bush's eye was trained on prosperity and re-election two years from now. With the economy on the verge of recession and the markets unsettled by events in the Persian Gulf, he chose to take his licks now rather than foster the economic chaos that would have resulted from a protracted fight with Congress, hoping that this will put him in a stronger position when he really needs it.
If the economy does slide into a recession, a fate that seems ever more likely with each new release of economic statistics, Mr. Bush will be in a position to deflect part of the blame to Democrats. They are the ones, he can say, who prevented the economic stimulus that he argued would have come from the capital gains tax break he worked for so hard and so long.
That could be especially important if the economy is still weak as the 1992 election approaches, since Presidents are inevitably held responsible for the state of the economy.
And if the economy has improved significantly by 1992, a turnaround his economic advisers expect, Mr. Bush can assert that it was his determination to drive down the deficit that led interest rates to fall and the economy to rebound.
 
Endangered Incumbents
''On balance,'' said a Democratic Senator, ''this package is not helpful to Democrats politically. It helps resolve the fiscal disaster the Republicans put us in with the notion that everybody could have a free lunch.''
The immediate political problem for Democrats, who hold the majority in the Senate and the House, is that it will be incumbents who will be called on to vote for such unpopular measures as a higher gasoline tax and a cut in Medicare benefits, and then defend them on the stump this fall.
Democratic leaders are trying to assemble enough votes from representatives with safe seats and senators not up for re-election that lawmakers in tough races can vote against the package.
''I may have to vote against it and hope it passes,'' admitted one Democratic Senator in a difficult re-election campaign.
But Democratic strategists saw advantages to their party as well.
First, they said, incumbents would have been held responsible if a budget compromise had failed and Government services had been cut back by across-the-board spending cuts required by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law. That was averted by the budget agreement.
Second, they maintain that they were the ones who protected Social Security, the Democrats' strongest card.
Finally, and most important over the long haul, they believe their refusal to budge in their stance against a cut in the capital gains tax reinforces the traditional position of Democrats as the party that favors economic equity.
Recent public opinion polls show that the Republican Party is increasingly viewed as the party of fat cats, and Democrats hope to burn that image into public consciousness.
 
Capital Gains as Weapon
Only 7.8 million of the 109.8 million tax returns that were filed in 1988 reported capital gains, and most of those profits from investments were claimed by the richest 1 percent of taxpayers, those with incomes above $200,000.
''They made a big mistake when they pushed for the capital gains cut for so long,'' said Senator Jim Sasser, a Tennessee Democrat. ''It has now been driven into the heartland that Republicans were insisting on tax cuts for the wealthy.''
In economic terms, the initial effect of taking $40 billion out of the economy in higher taxes and lower Government spending could drain economic output by almost 1 percent.
The Bush Administration is counting on the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates to offset the tighter fiscal policy. But changes in interest rates can take six months to a year to work their way through the economy, while tax and spending changes are felt at once.
Whatever the immediate consequences, the economic advantages over time could be manifold.
The ever-increasing budget deficit, now $293.7 billion by the Administration's latest estimate, is draining productive investment by Americans, using Government funds for interest payments instead of better roads, schools and research and eroding the quality of life of the next generation. Is Deal Credible? The White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, reflected the view of all the budget negotiators today when he said, ''The most important impact of this is as a contributor to the overall economic climate.''
The crucial question is whether the financial markets believe this is a credible budget deal, one the President and Congress will keep. In the past, deficit-reduction measures have amounted to little more than what the Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley, today called ''smoke and mirrors.''
But on the surface at least, this deal looks genuine, in large part because it does cause sacrifice.
Real new revenues and real new savings would result from a higher gasoline tax, higher Medicare premiums and deductibles and tight limits on military and domestic spending, assuming they are enacted.
The Administration figures that the deficit will fall from nearly $300 billion to about $80 billion in five years.
That is based on optimistic economic assumptions - that oil prices this year will average $21 a barrel, about half their current level, that short term interest rates will fall from about 8 percent to about 5 percent by 1993 and that the economy will avoid a recession and grow by more than one percent next year and by nearly 4 percent in 1992.
 
A First Step
But even if those estimates are faulty, the deal should at least halve the current deficit in five years so long as there is not a deep and prolonged recession.
Difficult fiscal problems would remain. For one, Social Security taxes would still be financing a large share of Government spending, an unhealthy situation in the opinion of economists and politicians in both parties.
But this budget agreement, if it becomes law, is at least a down payment, the first time in years that the President and Congress have jointly agreed to swallow a bitter pill to cure an economy that by all accounts is seriously ill.

HEADLINE: ACCORD TO REDUCE SPENDING AND RAISE TAXES IS REACHED; MANY IN CONGRESS CRITICAL;
Deadline Extended

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
President Bush and Congressional negotiators agreed today to a deficit-cutting plan that includes major increases in taxes after Mr. Bush decided that the need for economic stability was worth the sacrifice of his main policies on taxation.
Mr. Bush and a weary group of leaders from both parties gathered in the Rose Garden to announce their accord and to disclose that they now project the deficit for the 1991 fiscal year at $293.7 billion, up more than $60 billion from the estimate the Government made in July.
They said the plan would reduce the Federal deficit by $40 billion next year and by $500 billion over five years. But at the same time they agreed to extend the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deadline for bringing the budget into balance to the 1996 fiscal year from the 1993 year.
 
Lower Interest Rate Is Expected
Mr. Bush said he expected that enactment of the plan would stimulate the economy and lead to lower interest rates. But White House officials later said the economic projections underlying the plan also assumed that oil prices would fall. 
Mr. Bush immediately began selling the package to Congress, which took the first step today by approving a stopgap spending bill that would keep the Government in operation through Oct. 5 and avoid steep automatic spending cuts that were due to take effect on Monday.
Even as Mr. Bush began his sales pitch, dozens of rank-and-file members of Congress attacked the budget agreement. Republicans were angry about the tax increases, and Democrats about the cuts in domestic spending. [Page B8.] The compromise, a product of four months of negotiations between the White House and Congressional leaders, would impose steep spending cuts in popular domestic programs, particularly Medicare, while raising taxes on petroleum products as well as cigarettes, luxury items and alcoholic beverages. But the Social Security program was spared a direct hit.
The agreement forced tough political decisions upon President Bush. He gave up his long-sought goal of a cut in the capital gains tax rate and accepted a Democratic proposal that would restrict the amount of deductions that Americans with incomes over $100,000 could take on their Federal income tax returns. Excluding medical expenses and investment interest costs, this deducution floor, or the amount of income excluded from deductions, would be equal to 3 percent of a taxpayer's adjusted income over $100,000.
 
No Rate Change, Sununu Says
''The fact of the matter is that rates have not been changed,'' said the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, who argued that the agreed-upon change did not constitute a tax rate increase.
Democrats blocked the President on his pet issue, a cut in the tax on capital gains. The Democrats had insisted that any cut in the tax on the profits on the sale of assets be accompanied by an increase in tax rates for the wealthy. That would have put Mr. Bush at loggerheads with Republican House members, most of whom have vowed to block any rate increases.
The negotiators, who sealed the final deal at 3 A.M. today, decided at the last minute that they were unwilling to take the political risk of including Social Security for anything but a minor part of the deficit-cutting package. Earlier plans had called for either delaying cost of living adjustments for Social Security recipients or increasing the portion of their benefits now subject to income tax.
 
Political Strain
The political strain that the negotiations have engendered was illustrated by the absence from the Rose Garden meeting of two top Republicans, Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon and Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who were upset over the tax policies in the agreement.
But the Democratic leaders, who may face their own rebellion from the liberal wing of their party, signed up to sell the plan.
As he announced the accord this afternoon, Mr. Bush pledged: ''I will do everything I can to lay aside partisanship here and to take the case for this deal to the American people in every way I can.
''Sometimes you don't get it just the way you want, and this is such a time for me. But it's time we put the interest of the United States of America first and get this deficit under control.''
The House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley, told the President, ''We pledge our efforts with yours to convince our colleagues in the country that this is a strong undergirding of our economic future, our national prosperity and joint national interest.''
Both the President and the Congressional leaders noted that while the negotiations had been difficult the hardest task now lies ahead - getting rank-and-file members of the House and Senate to go along with the package.
 
Complicated Procedure
Under the complicated procedure worked out to try to assure that the House and Senate approve the final package intact, lawmakers will face a series of deadlines over the next three weeks to consider the specific spending cuts and tax increases recommended by their leaders. If the deadlines are not met, lawmakers would be faced at each step with the alternative of imposing the automatic spending cuts.
''This is not a marriage of love or convenience,'' Senator Phil Gramm, a Texas Republican, said, referring to the budget accord and the series of deadlines. ''I'm afraid if we take the shotgun away, they may not say, 'I do.' ''
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Senate Republican leader, warned that the ''nay sayers and the nit pickers may have a field day because the easy vote in this case is to find something you don't like and vote no.''
But he called the package ''a good, solid, positive package'' that would demonstrate that even a Congress and White House controlled by different political parties could work together.
The negotiators had originally been aiming for $50 billion in cuts for the 1991 fiscal year, but the figure slipped by $10 billion because of the decision to phase in the higher gasoline tax over two years and because of the elimination of the capital gains tax cut, which would actually have generated money in the first year even though it would have lost money over the long term.
The new $293.7 billion estimate of the fiscal 1991 deficit includes the projected cost of the savings and loan bailout and the surplus in the Social Security fund.
Over five years, the budget package would cut $170 billion from military programs and $120 billion from benefit programs like Medicare, farm subsidies and civil service retirement. Spending for other domestic programs and foreign aid would rise only as much as inflation for three years.
The package would raise $134 billion in new revenue from higher taxes and user fees for various Government services during the same period.
 
Money-Saving Measures
The main money-saving measures in the agreement include increased premiums and a higher deductible for Medicare, cuts in farm programs, military spending and retirement benefits for Federal employees. Medicare is administered by the Social Security Administration but is not formally a part of it.
The main revenue-raising provisions include a 5-cent-a-gallon increase in the Federal gasoline tax, effective Dec. 1, 1990, and an additional 5-cent-a-gallon increase effective July 1, 1991. There would also be a separate tax on petroleum that the White House Budget Director, Richard G. Darman, said would increase the tax on a gallon of gasoline an additional 2 cents. The package also includes higher taxes on cigarettes, a 10 percent tax on automobiles with prices over $30,000, boats over $100,000 and jewelry and furs over $5,000.

HEADLINE: Nuclear Issue Slows U.S. Aid to Pakistan

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
The United States has decided to withhold aid from Pakistan as it seeks new assurances from the Pakistani Government that it is slowing down its nuclear-weapons program, Administration officials said today.
The officials said the aid would be delayed until Administration officials were able to discuss the concerns with the Pakistani Government and with members of Congress who have raised questions about Islamabad's nuclear-weapons program.
This could delay the assistance until after Oct. 24, when a new Pakistani Government is to be elected, officials said today.
By law, aid to Pakistan cannot be continued unless President Bush certifies that Pakistan does not possess a nuclear weapon and that the American aid is serving to discourage Islamabad from developing nuclear weapons. $500 Million a Year Pakistan says that it does not possess nuclear weapons. And during her June 1989 visit to Washington, the former Prime Minister, Benazir Bhutto, declared in a speech to a joint session of Congress that Islamabad did not intend to develop a nuclear device. 
The United States gives about $500 million a year in assistance to Pakistan. The delay in certification will preclude Washington from providing new economic and military aid to Pakistan and will force a halt to military aid.
The Bush Administration has been caught in a dilemma. On the one hand, the Pakistani nuclear program is advancing and it is getting difficult to issue the required certification, officials say. Also the United States does not want to be accused of winking at Pakistan while hitting Iraq hard on proliferation issues.
On the other hand, Pakistan has been a longtime ally of the United States and has agreed to contribute troops to the effort in Saudi Arabia.
 
'There Are Questions'
''There are problems with the certification,'' an Administration official said. ''There are questions. Whether we could certify or not is in doubt.''
''The idea is to wait and work on something that meets Congressional concerns, deals with Pakistan's situation and also serves our nonproliferation and South Asian policies,'' the official added.
Another Administration official said that the United States was seeking ''assurances that the political leadership has made a decision to slow down its weapons-development activities.''
Such assurance, a third official said, should involve practical steps to constrain the nuclear-weapons program and should not be mere promises.
 
A Result of Growing Concern
Delays in certification have taken place before. The Reagan Administration, for example, issued its last two annual certifications in December and November. Last year, the Bush Administration provided the needed certification in early October.
But the current Administration move is plainly a result of growing concerns about Pakistan's nuclear program in the Administration and Congress.
Some lawmakers, for example, have already signaled the Administration that it will face strong debate if it proceeds with certification this year despite advances by the Pakistanis.
Representative Stephen J. Solarz, the Brooklyn Democrat who is the chairman of the House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asian and Pacific Affairs, sent a Sept. 19 letter to President Bush suggesting that aid to Pakistan be terminated.
 
'Credible Assurances'
''On the basis of a number of reports I've received from unclassified sources, I have the impression that Pakistan's commitments to respect the various markers we set last year have not been met,'' Mr. Solarz wrote.
Mr. Solarz said in a recent interview that he might drop his opposition to continued aid if the Bush Administration obtained ''credible assurances'' from Pakistani leaders that they would constrain their nuclear program. But he expressed doubt that such assurances could be obtained.
Delaying certification will provide the Administration with an opportunity to try to obtain additional assurances from the Pakistanis, which Administration officials could cite to justify a Presidential decision to issue a subsequent certification.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
River View Of Reality, Or a Dream

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DAYR ALLA, Jordan

 BODY:
Through the mist, 20-year-old Hamad Wajih could clearly see an Israeli border kibbutz only a mile or so away over the Jordan River.
And, listening to the radio over the last several weeks, Mr. Wajih has repeatedly heard President Saddam Hussein of Iraq inveigh against Israel, including his latest threat - that, if the worldwide economic embargo begins to strangle his nation, ''oil, the region and Israel will be the victims of the resulting deluge.''
But Mr. Wajih, like many other native Jordanians interviewed in this little border village and at other spots near Israel, shook his head and said he believed that Mr. Hussein's threats were little more than bluff.
''No, no, no,'' he said with a dismissive click of the tongue. ''Iraq is too busy with its own crisis to come over here. That is only for the Palestinians to hear. It's because Saddam has promised them he is an Arab leader.'' 
Mr. Wajih said he believes Iraq should pull its troops out of Kuwait, too. And conversations with many native Jordanians like him along the border today showed that Jordan's view is not as monolithic as some people might believe.
 
Portraits of a Savior
Half or more of Jordan's residents are of Palestinian origin, and over the last two months they have been loud in their support of Mr. Hussein.
They see him as a potential savior, who will redeem their land after 42 years of waiting. Across Jordan, they hang portraits of Mr. Hussein in store windows, in the rear windows of cars, even in police kiosks and on Jordanian Army buildings.
But the other half of this country, the quieter half, is Jordanian. Certainly, many of these people are impassioned, unquestioning supporters of the Iraqi leader too. But just as many, it seems, are not.
Jordanians and Palestinians live side by side in peace; they are equal citizens in the Hashemite Kingdom.
''We are one people, really - like the Americans and the British,'' said Ishan Tala, a native Jordanian from a Bedouin family. But, like the Americans and the British, Jordanians and Palestinians are keenly aware of their own identities, and they often hold differing views.
 
Shaking of Heads
All Jordanians, no matter what their background, say the Americans and other foreign forces should leave the Persian Gulf. But many of them say with equal fervor that Iraq should pull out of Kuwait as well.
''As our King Hussein has repeatedly told the world, in no way do we sanction the acquisition of land by force,'' said a recent press release issued by a group of women calling itself Jordanian Mothers.
But even without any reference to their monarch, many other native Jordanians say they feel the same way. Numerous Jordanians also say they believe that Mr. Hussein's promises to liberate Palestine are worth nothing more than a dismissive shake of the head.
''I support Saddam on a just cause, but I would like Iraq to pull out of Kuwait,'' said 34-year-old Salah Adwan, a Jordanian who owns a streetside cafe in Al Karama. ''He is putting Jordan in an extra critical situation, and the invasion of Iraq was not a rightful action. All Jordanians with a conscience feel this way.''
Mr. Adwan doesn't buy Mr. Hussein's promise to retake ''Palestine'' either.
''Only God can know what will happen,'' he said as he swatted at a swarm of flies. ''But I don't think he will come here against Israel.''
That set off a good-natured debate around the table. Sitting next to Mr. Adwan, Ahmed Abu Tahu, a Palestinian auto mechanic, shook his head and pointed over the river as he said: ''Iraq came here in 1948, and they didn't have all the weapons Saddam has now. Of course he will come here, and I hope he can take Jerusalem back for us.''
 
Maps Tell the Story
A 22-year-old native Jordanian truck driver, Shadeh Dgheimat, offered his own view: ''Saddam has to back away, and then the Americans will back away too. Nothing is going to happen with Israel. Everybody's being too cautious.''
Dismissal of the state of Israel's existence is ingrained in Jordanian culture at every level. Maps published here label the land to the west as Palestine - if the area is given any name at all. And unless a foreigner uses Israel's proper name first, most Jordanians of all backgrounds will naturally refer only to Palestine.
An official Government pamphlet in English, giving basic ''facts and figures on the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan,'' describes the nation's location as follows: ''Crossroads of the Middle East; common borders with Syria to the north, Iraq to the East, Saudi Arabia to the east and south, Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea to the south.'' The western border is not mentioned.
But here on that border, native Jordanians and Palestinians are quite aware Israel is there. When Jordanians look across the river, they see an unfortunate reality. But the Palestinians see a dream.
''It's the will of God that Saddam will take back our land,'' said Hamad Ibrahim Felat, a 57-year-old shopkeeper in Al Karama. He was born near what is now Ashkelon, Israel.
''God has said Israel will rise, and then Israel will fall,'' he said. ''The situation now is a sign that Israel is going down.''
Down the street, another Palestinian shopkeeper, Jamil Mohammed Tasir, had a more earthly dream. ''After the situation in the gulf is settler,'' he said, ''Saddam will be on top, and he will force a big international conference leaning on the Israelis to give us back our land.''
Eighty-year-old Musla Abbadi, also a native of Jordan, pointed to the picture of Saddam Hussein taped to the side of the wall and said: ''He did wrong by going into Kuwait. I'm with Saddam; all Arabs are with Saddam. But I'm with King Hussein first before Saddam.''
As for the question of ''redemption'' of the land to west, he said: ''It's just a Palestinian feeling.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Sheik of Few Words Gets Message Across

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER

 BODY:
Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah is a public relations firm's nightmare. He hates to travel. He speaks no English. Even in his native Arabic, he is a most uncharismatic speaker. He is usually described, charitably, as a painfully shy man of uncommonly few words.
To make matters worse, the exiled Emir of Kuwait hates publicity. Despite appeals from his most intimate advisers and the Citizens for a Free Kuwait, a group of savvy Kuwaiti exiles who have been trying to build support here for their country, Sheik Jaber has refused to meet with reporters. And he has shunned in particular the ''up close and personal'' television interviews that his advisers argue would enable him to dramatize his country's plight and appeal directly for support to the American people. 
 
'Total Consensus' Reported
''The Kuwaitis have a lot of dignity; they feel that their case speaks for itself,'' said Frank Mankiewicz, the veteran political campaign consultant and vice chairman of Hill & Knowlton. His firm was retained by the citizens group last month to help Kuwait sell its message. ''The Kuwaitis are simply unfamiliar with a culture in which it is not enough to be on the right side of an issue; you have to be seen by television viewers to have right on your side.''
Given the Emir's retiring nature, Hill & Knowlton executives say, Sheik Jaber has, in his understated way, gotten his message across loud and clear. In Washington, where senior Kuwaitis met with President Bush and senior Administration officials, there was ''a total consensus on the key issues,'' said a senior member of the delegation.
A senior Administration official, who like the Kuwaiti insisted on not being identified, concurred, saying Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Colin L. Powell, had been ''enormously impressed by the Emir's portrayal of what was taking place inside Kuwait under Iraqi occupation.''
 
First U.S. Trip
This is the first trip by the ruling al-Sabah family to the United States since their country was overrun by Iraqi troops on Aug. 2. The citizens group has been hoping to make the most of it. Members have been eager for the ruling family to dispel impressions that their aloofness bordered on arrogance.
Fawzi H. al-Sultan, an executive director of the World Bank who is active in the citizens committee, said he and others had been pained by questions raised before the trip here by Kuwaitis and non-Kuwaitis alike. ''People would ask us, where are the al-Sabahs? Where is your Government?'' Mr. Sultan said. ''Why have they not denounced the Iraqis more forcefully?'' Dazzling Impression at U.N. The high point of the visit so far was Sheik Jaber's speech to the United Nations on Thursday. The Kuwaiti delegates made a dazzling impression as they swept through the normally pinstiped, double-breasted corridors outside the General Assembly in their traditional Kuwaiti dress.
A seemingly tiny figure in the giant Assembly chamber, Sheik Jaber rattled out his text like a schoolboy racing through a recitation in history class. But his speech prompted a thunderous standing ovation from the delegates, and the Emir, who seemed unprepared for the reaction, was seen brushing an errant tear from his cheek as he left the chamber.
 
An Anxiety Is Relieved
''Distancing.'' That was the unspoken word on the Kuwaiti delegates' lips before they left New York for their meetings with President Bush and the Congress on Friday.
The concern, which few dared to discuss publicly, was that while the Bush Administration was committed to forcing the Iraqi Army to withdraw from Kuwait, it was less dedicated to the restoration of the ''legitimate'' rulers of the sheikdom. President Bush's recent offhand comment suggesting that Kuwait's Government was hardly a perfect democracy deepened their anxiety.
Since that remark, White House officials have taken pains to dispel any impression that there is, in one White House official's words, ''any daylight at all'' between the al-Sabahs and the Bush Administration over the return of the royal family to power.
The issue is not merely a matter of principle for the Administration; it is also good tactics. ''If Saddam Hussein is able to sense any distance at all between the ruling family and this Administration, he might misinterpret our commitment to the al-Sabahs' return,'' said an Administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
 
A Promise on Democracy
The reassurances relieved and delighted the Kuwaitis. Sulaiman A. Mutawa, the Planning Minister, expressed exasperation when asked whether the al-Sabahs would consider restoring the old Parliament, which was suspended in 1986 and replaced last June by a National Assembly with considerably fewer powers and less independence.
''You're putting the cart before the horse,'' he said. ''But I can assure you that if and when we go back, we're willing to speed up our democratic process, the democracy outlined in our Constitution. That was being implemented even before the invasion.''
''What you've got to understand,'' said Waleed al-Marzook, chief editor of al-Anbah, a Kuwaiti paper that is now being published in Cairo, ''is that even before, Kuwaitis did not question the right of the al-Sabahs to rule, only how they should rule and how much democracy there should be. But today every Kuwaiti, no matter who and where he is, supports the Emir and the al-Sabahs. When we get back, things will be sorted out.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF: WASHINGTON AT WORK;
Bush's Modulator of the Gulf Policy, And of What Not to Do or Say Now

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 29

 BODY:
After the late-night call from the White House telling him that Iraq had invaded Kuwait, Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, had no doubt that the United States had to be prepared to go to war, if necessary, to stop Saddam Hussein.
He just as quickly reached a second conclusion, and then a third.
The invasion made it clear that the Iraqi President had to be neutralized as a regional power. And the Bush Administration could not say the destruction of President Hussein and his war machine was the goal of American policy if it hoped to avoid war and win broad support for aims that could be achieved through diplomacy and sanctions.
For more than eight weeks, Mr. Scowcroft has helped President Bush grapple with the tension arising from these early judgments. It drives the carefully modulated policy of forcing Iraq out of Kuwait with sanctions and leaving the question of what to do about Mr. Hussein for the future. 
 
Shared Generational Experience
Mr. Scowcroft's conclusions were shared by the President and his other top advisers, just as they share formative generational experiences: decades of watching American goals drown in overambitious or poorly articulated foreign policies.
''It's nice to get involved in something and keep thinking, 'Boy, you know, while we're doing this, let's clean up four or five other things,' '' Mr. Scowcroft said in an interview. As the retired Air Force general reflected on the days since the invasion, he reached back to an experience that did much to form his thinking - the Korean War. In Korea, he is fond of pointing out, United Nations forces led by the United States decided after early victories to push beyond their initial goals and drive north to North Korea's border with China at the Yalu River, thereby courting disaster by drawing China into the war.
''The Yalu River is a case where it looked like a great thing to do, but in fact it caused us enormous problems,'' Mr. Scowcroft said.
''And therefore, while it would be nice to do some other things than what we specifically started out to do,'' he said of the Persian Gulf crisis, ''what I'm saying is we would consider it a signal victory to accomplish what we said we needed to do.''
 
Balancing Unstated Desires
The task of balancing American's unstated desires and its articulated policy of forcing Mr. Hussein out of Kuwait through diplomacy and economic pressure now shape the days of the man who once seemed to the world outside the White House to be a shadow following Mr. Bush, his voice on policy as whispery as his demeanor.
For even if Iraq is driven from Kuwait by sanctions and diplomatic pressure, White House officials have begun to realize, they will still have to meet the challenge of keeping a bloodless victory from turning into a bloodless defeat.
''If our strategy works,'' a senior official said of President Hussein, ''he still has his army, he still has his chemical plants, he still has his incipient nuclear capability.''
''But we decided early on that adding as an objective the elimination of Saddam Hussein as an individual or the Iraqi Army as an institution should not be the focus of national policy,'' said the official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified.
 
Pressure From Outside
The passing of some early milestones - insuring Saudi Arabia's defense and imposing the economic sanctions - and the threat of the destruction of Kuwait as a sovereign nation have increased pressure from outside the White House to reach for more sweeping military aims.
As national security adviser, Mr. Scowcroft is increasingly involved in the effort to deal with these issues, just as he was at the fulcrum of the balance Mr. Bush has struck between his public goals and his unstated objectives.
The 65-year-old Mr. Scowcroft, who was also national security adviser to President Ford, played a crucial role in proposals for deep troop cuts in Europe and in nuclear arms control negotiations. At the same time, he was often blamed for what some critics perceived as an overly cautious initial approach to the upheaval in Eastern Europe in 1989.
And as Mr. Bush's secret envoy to China last year, he bore some criticism for the President's effort to improve relations with Beijing after its violent suppression of pro-democracy demonstators. But he also is given credit for restricting the National Security Council staff, which he heads, to research, policy advice and speech-writing, not the kind of political infighting and covert operations that tarred the council's reputation under President Reagan.
 
Always at President's Side
A slight, austere figure who seems uncomfortable when he dons his checkered pants for a frantic round of golf with Mr. Bush, Mr. Scowcroft has always been at the President's side -in the Oval Office, on the golf course, in the blue-and-white speedboat off the Maine coast. During the gulf crisis, it became clear that he was not just tagging along.
During the long hours they spent together in August, Mr. Scowcroft said, he helped Mr. Bush put the final touches on his strategy and made arrangements for the President's ''endless phone calls'' to world leaders.
Mr. Scowcroft shifted uncomfortably in a chair in his West Wing corner office at the suggestion that he had achieved a new measure of power in the President's inner circle, which until August seemed so clearly dominated by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d.
If the lineup seems more hazy now, Mr. Scowcroft said, the image is ephemeral. ''I do the things I always do in a crisis,'' he said. ''Maybe it was more visible, and maybe I had to do more, but I think that it was more in the nature of the crisis than that there was a substantial change in the roles of the players.''
A senior official who insisted on anonymity said Mr. Scowcroft's discussions with the President had helped set the guidelines for what the Administration was willing to tolerate in the gulf: ''How does it look in 90 days?'' the official said. ''Suppose Hussein gets desperate and decides his only way out is to get the Israelis involved? Suppose something happens to our Ambassador in Kuwait? Suppose some hostages are killed? Suppose he attacks the oilfields? What are the chances that the sanctions will in fact work?''
 
Baker Overseas at Outset
Mr. Scowcroft's presence was felt most strongly at the outset of the crisis, when Mr. Baker was overseas.
Mr. Scowcroft's colleagues said he never had any doubt that the United States would have to deploy troops, although it was not clear if Saudi Arabia would cooperate.
To prepare the case, he worked closely with Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and with Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. Some Administration officials say this troika has produced a new axis of influence in the White House.
Robert M. Gates, Mr. Scowcroft's deputy, said Mr. Scowcroft had articulated ''the need to respond strongly and without equivocation'' during the first post-invasion meetings of the President's security advisers.
''There was not any real dispute, but it was a matter of the urgent evolution of people's thinking,'' Mr. Gates said. ''And in that, Brent was perhaps a step ahead. He played a central role in bringing together the consensus that formed rather quickly and in the crystallization of the U.S. response.''
 
'A Careful, Measured Policy'
Another official said the approach Mr. Scowcroft had advocated was ''a careful, measured policy that is characteristic of Brent,'' adding ''He is prepared to use force, but like a lot of the ex-military guys of his generation, it's not something you do casually.''
Mr. Scowcroft, a West Point graduate and a pilot, spent much of his Air Force career in the strategic, diplomatic and political branches, especially in East-West relations and arms control.
From 1982 until he joined the Bush White House, he worked for Henry A. Kissinger's New York consulting firm. He also served on three prominent commissions: setting American doctrine for strategic nuclear missiles, reviewing Pentagon management and, perhaps most important for his view of his current job, one that investigated the Iran-contra affair in 1986-87. It is a classic cold war resume. ''For Brent, Bush and Baker, the 1930's are a historical memory,'' an official said. ''They are postwar babies in the political sense. Their historical context is not Munich but Korea, Vietnam, Soviet-American confrontation.''
 
How to Neutralize Hussein
In addition to shaping the goals for the military operation, the experiences that Mr. Scowcroft shares with Mr. Bush and his other advisers also played a role in the Administration's groping for a political structure that could neutralize Mr. Hussein's military strength if he left Kuwait.
An official said: ''You've got a Eurocentric group - arms control types, East-West specialists, diplomats - who have just come through the amazing time of ending the cold war. There is a sense that how we handle this crisis will have consequences reaching far into the future. Nobody wants to blow it.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Poll Finds Strong Support for Bush's Goals, but Reluctance to Start a War

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Americans overwhelmingly support President Bush's goals in the Persian Gulf, but are not ready to start a war for them, according to a study of public opinion released today.
The results of the survey, conducted for Americans Talk Security, a bipartisan group of polling and consulting firms, are being issued at a time of increasing concern in Washington that options short of war may not be adequate for forcing Iraq out of Kuwait.
But 9 out of 10 Americans are not ready for their country to start a war. And nearly half of those surveyed suggested they would be suspicious if the United States said Iraq had started a war. 
Seven out of 10 people said the United States should not even consider starting a war until the economic blockade of Iraq and Kuwait and other initiatives have been given a chance to work. Another 2 in 10 said the United States should never start a war in the gulf under any circumstances. One in 10 said the United States should go to war now.
 
Most Favor Readiness
Among those who wanted to wait and see whether the sanctions work, the overwhelming majority said that the United States should get ready for a war in the gulf and stay ready, but never start one.
Two-thirds of the Americans surveyed said they were not at all convinced by the suggestion: ''The longer we wait the more things can go against us. If the President thinks we can win, why wait?''
One thousand adults were interviewed between Sept. 21 and 26 for the survey, which had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.2 percentage points.
The survey consisted of 62 questions about attitudes on the Persian Gulf, making it by far the most extensive effort made public to explore American opinion on the subject.
Americans were evenly divided on how strong the United States military response should be if Iraq attacks American forces in the gulf region. Of the people surveyed, 49 percent said the response should be limited to the force necessary for defense, and 47 percent said they would favor a massive counterattack and all-out war.
The legacy of the Vietnam War was reflected in different and potentially contradictory ways.
Americans do not want another military stalemate. Asked what they would do if war did break out and then reached a stalemate, 73 percent said they would favor launching a massive all-out attack to win.
But Americans are not certain that their Government will be candid with them if war does come. About 47 percent said they believed the United States would tell the American people that Iraq had started the war when the United States actually had started it. Forty-two percent said the United States would not do this.
The reluctance of Americans to start a war does not seem to be rooted in ambivalence about the nation's goals or interests in the Persian Gulf. Three-quarters of those surveyed said that President Bush did the right thing by sending troops to the region.
 
Nine Goals Highly Valued
Alan F. Kay, director of Americans Talk Security, said that nine goals in the Persian Gulf were viewed as very important or extremely important by at least 7 of 10 Americans. These ranged from bringing lasting peace to the Middle East and preventing a war to removing Saddam Hussein as President of Iraq and insuring that oil flows freely.
Among the other goals valued by the respondents were establishing the principle that aggression will no longer be tolerated, securing an Iraq withdrawal from Kuwait, and eliminating Iraq's ability to wage an aggressive war.
Mr. Kay said the wide array of goals supported by the respondents was unusual for an American military commitment, and that it might present some dangers.
 
Chance That Support Could Fade
While support for a number of goals helps foster enormous support for a commitment to the gulf, he said, it also means that American support could break down as the situation grows more complicated and some goals are achieved and others abandoned.
The return to power of the Kuwaiti royal family, a goal dramatized last week by the visit to Washington of the Emir of Kuwait, Jaber al-Ahmed Al-Sabah, was viewed as very important or extremely important by only 43 percent of Americans.
While only 12 percent of Americans said that maintaining the flow of oil was the top goal, 26 percent said that it was the main goal of President Bush.
Mr. Kay said the public was in this case ''taking the high ground,'' adding, ''When they think about politicians, they're a little more realistic.''

HEADLINE: WORLD SUMMIT FOR CHILDREN;
Excerpts From Remarks by Leaders At U.N. World Summit for Children

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from addresses by national leaders and the United Nations Secretary General today before the General Assembly at the World Summit for Children:
 
President Bush
We've seen children - swollen bellies - we've seen the pleading eyes of starvation, we've heard the cries of children dying of disease. So let us affirm in this historic summit that these children can be saved. They can be saved when we live up to our responsibilities, not just as an assembly of governments, but as a world community of adults, of parents.
In my time as President, I've heard the heartrending cries of AIDS babies, I've stood helpless over infants born addicted to cocaine, their tiny bodies trembling with pain. But I've also been to many classrooms across America, where the influence of love and well-being can be seen instantly in bright faces and wondering eyes. From all these experiences and many more, I've learned that our children are a mirror, an honest reflection of their parents and their world. Sometimes the reflection is flattering and at other times we simply don't like what we see. But we must never turn away. 
So far I've spoken here just briefly of the most urgent issues of survival. But simple survival is not enough for a child lacking in health or learning or denied the love of family and time for play. One year and two days ago, I met with the governors of our 50 states on a single topic of national importance.
We agreed to set ambitious education goals for the year 2000. For America this is a stiff challenge, self-imposed. And I see among us today many leaders who should take pride in giving the world examples of educational excellence, examples the next generation of Americans will not leave unchallenged.
But of course, education is a mystery to the 100 million children not in school. It's an outrage that so many spend their childhood in mines, in factories, in the twilight world of the streets. The United States outlawed most forms of child labor decades ago. And let us strive together to make education the primary work of all children.
 
Vaclav Havel: President of Czechoslovakia
A thousand times in the last decades I have seen in my country many bent backs, allegedly bent in the interests of children. A thousand times I have heard people defend their servitude to a hated regime by the argument that they were doing it only for their children: to be able to feed them, to make it possible for them to study, to be able to afford vacations at the seaside for them.
A thousand times various acquaintances as well as strangers confided to me that they were in their mind and soul totally on our side, that is on the side of so-called dissidents, and that they signed various petition campaigns aimed against us and organized by the totalitarian government for the sole reason they had children and could not thus afford the luxury of resistance. Immorality was thus committed in the name of children and evil was served for their alleged good.
But I have seen even greater perversities, if only on the movies or on TV; I saw Hitler waving in a friendly manner to fanaticized little girls of the Hitlerjugend; I saw mass murderer Stalin kissing a child with the red Communist youth organization scarf, a child whose parents ended up like so many in Gulag camps; I saw Gottwald, the Stalin of Czechoslovakia, smilingly joking with young miners, the builders of socialism and soon to be cripples; I saw the Iraqi president Hussein patting the children of his hostages whom - as he now says - he is ready to have shot.
I know and have experienced how in Czechoslovakia thousands of people suffered in Communist concentration camps, how hundreds of them were executed and tortured to death, and this all for the false happiness of generations yet unborn in some false paradise.
How much evil has already been committed in the name of children!
But I have also experienced something very different. I have even experienced it as recently as several months ago, a year ago, two years ago. I have experienced the beautiful revolt of children against the lie that their parents had served, allegedly in the interest of those very children: our anti-totalitarian revolution was -at least in its beginnings - a children's revolution.
 
Yoweri Kuguta Museveni: President of Uganda
Africa's problems, which are the underlying causes of so many deaths of her children. 1) The prevalence of authoritarian, top-down styles of government. The business of government is conducted in writing while the majority of the people are illiterate. Africa is the only region in the world where government is conducted in languages foreign to the majority of the population.
Any serious effort to solve Africa's problems must begin by addressing the issue of liberating and empowering the great great populations through a systematic education process. 2) The oppression of man by man. Rural poverty in many parts of Africa has been the cause of so much civil strife and the post-independence period has seen serious ethnic, regional and border conflicts erupting in many parts of the continent. Thus, 70 percent of the population of the sub-Saharan Africa have suffered severe and prolonged conflicts since the mid-50's. Violence has been fanned by a heavy flow of arms from industrialized states, accounting for a record number of war-related deaths, leaving millions of orphans to die from starvation and preventable diseases.
 
Brian Mulroney: Prime Minister of Canada
Resources always seem to be scarce. The ''peace dividend'' many expected from the end of the Cold War has already been diluted by aggression in the Persian Gulf. Once again, the neediest children have lost - in large measure because so few voices among the powerful have spoken out strongly on their behalf.
Today may represent the beginning of a change in the lives of the world's children. Today, in this hall, they may finally have found the voices and the friends they have long been seeking.
With all the demands on governments to fund worthwhile activities, there will never be enough money to do everything and priorities will have to be established and difficult choices made. Funding is important but it is not, in the end, the decisive factor in the war on child suffering. Political will is.
 
Carlos Salinas de Gortari: President of Mexico
I would like to call your attention to the plight of migrant children, child refugees and illegal traffic in minors. Seeing brave and courageous men and women emigrate has not been the least painful consequence of the economic crisis. Those who make the decision to emigrate often have to face the violation of their human rights and the break-up of their family life.
The main victims are the children. In areas where emigration is widespread, children sometimes spend their whole life waiting for the return of their absent father or mother. Nations without sound family units are divided societies.
For many years, my country has experienced the presence of child refugees from Central America along our southern border. With the support of UNICEF and in accordance with our law, these children have met with assistance, understanding and respect in our country.
We should defend the principle of family unit to the utmost. Consequently, it is also important for the world community to put an end to the illegal international traffic of minors.
We need to act promptly to establish rules for cooperation in eradicating this cruelest commerce of all.
 
Javier Perez de Cuellar: Secretary General of the United Nations
Poverty, I repeat, is the main enemy of children. Hunger, disease, illiteracy, despair - these constitute the enemy's fearful train. There is no way in which issues relating to children can be segregated from the issues of the overall social and economic environment.
We now have a unique opportunity to establish a world order which encompasses not only the maintenance of peace and security but also the better management of the world's economic and social affairs. With the ideological gulf bridged, the removal of the disparity between the North and South demands a high-level dialogue. Such a dialogue should aim at a global consensus. The moving concern which has occasioned this summit meeting must now guide the international community in that endeavor.

HEADLINE: Argentine Leader Sees Gulf Role As Best Way to Reverse Old Image

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

 BODY:
President Carlos Saul Menem of Argentina, the only Latin American leader to order forces to join the blockade against Iraq, says he did so in the hope of presenting a new image of his country as a reliable partner.
''We felt that we could not take the same attitude of other years, which caused us serious damage,'' Mr. Menem said in an interview on Saturday evening, referring to his country's neutrality throughout most of World War II. ''This attitude of Argentina opens enormous possibilities for us in the new international order.''
First among those opportunities will be the chance to meet privately in New York with President Bush on a day when some 70 other foreign leaders will be jockeying for the American leader's attention. 
After Mr. Menem announced on Sept. 19 that he would send two warships, a cargo plane and as many as 450 troops to the Persian Gulf, United States officials rescheduled a session with President Bush that Mr. Menem was to have shared with several other foreign leaders. The two Presidents and their aides are now to have breakfast together this morning.
 
Sees Positive Response
Despite protests in Buenos Aires against Mr. Menem's decision, including criticism from some lawmakers in his own Peronist party, Mr. Menem said that reaction elsewhere had been quick and positive.
He pointedly noted the congratulations of Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, from whom warm words until recently would have been unimaginable.
Argentina's last military conflict was its six-week war in 1982 over the Falkland Islands, which it lost to Britain. Immediately after taking office, Mr. Menem sought a rapprochement that led to the restoration in February of full diplomatic relations between the two countries. Argentina still claims sovereignty over the islands.
''Argentina has been treated in the last few years like a country that was unserious and unreliable,'' President Menem said. ''Argentina is now relocating itself in a world that will make possible its definitive and sustained development.''
 
Reassuring Creditors
Mr. Menem said he did not expect an Argentine presence in the gulf to be rewarded with direct economic aid from abroad. But other Argentine officials said the move was one of many intended to reshape Argentina's international image in a way that would reassure creditor nations and potential foreign investors.
The Argentine Foreign Minister, Domingo Cavallo, noted that his country acceded last fall to a request by President Bush that it halt cooperation with Iraq and Egypt on the development of the Condor-2 ballistic missile. Mr. Cavallo said the missile program has been phased out over the last year.
Mr. Cavallo said in an interview that Mr. Menem would use his meeting with President Bush to discuss not only the gulf crisis, but trade issues. Argentina is opposed to subsidies for American grain and is requesting that Washington lift import duties on Argentine steel, leather and fruit juices.
Since he took office 14 months ago, Mr. Menem has scaled back state control of the economy. But despite policies that have reduced inflation from a rate of more than 200 percent the month he became President, the economy remains unstable. He said his Government was having difficulty attracting buyers for some of the companies it wants to sell.
 
Will Fight Isolation
Mr. Menem said that one Peronist experience he is determined not to repeat was Argentina's economic isolation, particularly in regard to the United States, in the decade after World War II when Juan D. Peron ruled the country.
As a powerful army colonel and then as Minister of War and Vice President, Mr. Peron was prominent among the nationalist officers who sought to keep Argentina neutral until near the end of World War II. Argentina finally declared war on Germany and Japan in late March of 1945.
Later the United States helped send the Argentine economy into a tailspin when it rejected a plea to let the recovering nations of Western Europe spend Marshall Plan dollars on imports from Argentina.
Contrary to reports of some Argentine military opposition to the shipment of troops to the Persian Gulf, Mr. Menem declared, officers are ''lining up to go.'' He said that many of those volunteering were veterans of the war for the Falklands.
With the prospect of military conflict with its neighbors virtually nonexistent, other Argentine officials say, the country's armed forces should focus their efforts on taking part in international security missions.
''The old hypotheses of conflict are losing their validity,'' Mr. Cavallo said. ''If the armed forces aren't available for this, what are they for?''

HEADLINE: Turnpike Journal;
Born as Place to Rest, Town Doesn't

BYLINE: By AGIS SALPUKAS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BREEZEWOOD, Pa., Sept. 29

 BODY:
''Breezewood Town of Motels, Food, Fuel,'' the sign proclaims on Exit 12 of the Pennsylvania Turnpike. And for most of the time since the nation's first superhighway opened 50 years ago, Breezewood has been delivering what it promises.
The thousands of truckers and other travelers who turn off daily to make the town home for a night are welcomed by 10 motels, 14 fast-food restaurants and 7 fuel and service stations, including two sprawling truck stops. It is all concentrated on a half-mile strip of road that connects the Turnpike exit and Interstate 70. 
There are no homes along the strip. The only church, the Mount Zion Lutheran Church, has a barrier across its circular driveway and a sign telling motorists that there is a turnaround 200 feet down the road.
The town of several hundred people has no mayor or police force, relying instead on the State Police. A tourist association is the government.
It's a one-industry town. Almost all who live here make their living catering to the stream of cars and trucks that at times turns the main street into a jam worthy of a major city.
''That's all you can do in town is eat, sleep and fuel up your car,'' said Lois Pressel, the desk clerk at the Quality Inn Breeze Manor, situated on a rise that overlooks the southern Alleghenies.
The town is about 116 miles east of Pittsburgh and 180 miles west of Philadelphia, which makes it an ideal point for stopping to eat or sleep. As a result, Breezewood became a creation of the Pennsylvania Turnpike, which observes its 50th anniversary on Monday.
When the first 160 miles of the Turnpike opened at 12:01 A.M. on Oct. 1, 1940, it introduced an era of safer, high-speed roads that eventually grew into the 43,000-mile Interstate system. No speed limits existed on the turnpike in its early days, and many drivers cruised along at 90 miles an hour, stopping mainly at rest stops for a snack and gas.
Motorists lined up days before the opening to be among the first to use the road. Traffic grew as the highway stretched to its current 360 miles and connected to the New Jersey Turnpike and the Ohio Turnpike. From 2.5 million vehicles in 1947, the Turnpike's volume increased to 22.7 million by 1957. Last year, it was more than 80 million.
When the turnpikes connected in 1956, a driver could enter the Lincoln Tunnel in New York and drive 850 miles to Chicago in about 16 hours, paying $10.80 in tolls and about $30 for gas, and not hitting one stop light.
Safety and government officials became concerned over the new phenomenon of ''driver hypnosis.'' Only a 10-foot-wide strip of grass separated the two sets of lanes. Dozing drivers who crossed the strip into oncoming traffic occasionally made the Turnpike deadly until guard rails were installed in 1957, reducing the death rate dramatically.
Few people foresaw the enormous changes the Turnpike would bring to its region, among them the withering of small towns and rural areas that lined the old main route across Pennsylvania, the two-lane Route 30 known at the Lincoln Highway. After the Turnpike opened, traffic on the Lincoln Highway dropped to about half, forcing many small businesses to close.
But for communities along the superhighway, the Turnpike was a major stimulus.
Breezewood is an example. Until the 1960's, the town consisted of a gas station and a coffee shop, a Howard Johnson's Restaurant and a truck stop, said Pat Lyon, who works in the gift shop at the Crawford Museum, one of the few businesses here that is not part of a chain.
Most of Ms. Lyon's working life has revolved around the town. ''I started as a maid cleaning rooms when I was 15 and a half years old,'' she said. ''It's hard to believe how it has grown.''
A walk along the strip is hazardous, since there are no sidewalks. For the most part, pedestrians are unfortunate people whose cars must have broken down. The development is so dense at some points that the gas stations and fast-food places are piled three-deep on the side of the road.
''I don't think too much more can go in,'' said Gussie Peck, who has worked as a waitress at Howard Johnson's for more than 30 years. ''Every time we say that something else pops up.''
For Terry Welch, a trucker spending his honeymoon on the road, the Breezewood services are vital. Pulling into the Gateway Truck Stop with his Mack truck loaded with manure spreaders, he and his bride, Angela, went in for coffee and pie. He hauls mostly farm equipment made by Ford New Holland Inc., which has plants in several Pennsylvania locations. ''I'm on the pike at least five times a week,'' he said.
It's the fastest and most economical route for him, Mr. Welch said, even though the tolls can total more than $50 a trip, depending on the load.
He tries to avoid the two-lane highways with their steep grades and numerous stop lights. ''It's two times the wear and tear on the truck, two times as much fuel and two times the wear on yourself,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Running for Senate, Ex-Head of Klan Trails in Polls but Shakes Louisiana

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAKE CHARLES, La., Sept. 30

 BODY:
Outside, the air was roaring with the carnival rides and fireworks of the Southwest Louisiana State Fair and Trade Exposition, but inside a nearby auditorium David Duke was offering a ride of his own.
Mr. Duke, a State Senator, former national grand wizard of the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, founder of the National Association for the Advancement of White People and candidate for the United States Senate, was complaining about welfare recipients ''having children faster than they can raise your taxes to pay for them.''
He talked about what he called the outrages of affirmative action and about white people being accused of racism when they simply seek equal rights. He talked about the woman who said to him, ''Mr. Duke, I don't know if we're ever going to have another white Miss America in this country.'' He paused only for the bursts of applause from an audience of about 300 and the low chants of ''Duke! Duke! Duke!'' 
 
A Distant Second
Six days before the primary election here, Mr. Duke, a Republican repudiated by his national party, has been running a distant second in statewide polls to the 18-year incumbent, J. Bennett Johnston, a Democrat. Mr. Johnston's aides predict with increasing confidence that the Senator will win Saturday's election with more than 50 percent of the vote and thus avert a runoff against Mr. Duke, although many of Mr. Duke's foes remain nervous. In Louisiana, all candidates for an office compete in a single primary, and if no candidate wins a majority of the vote, the top two candidates, regardless of party, meet in a runoff on Election Day in November.
For all of the confidence among Mr. Johnston's aidies, the Duke campaign has raised questions and issues that transcend the voting on Saturday. Many in Louisiana fear that whatever happens to the messenger, the message now has a life of its own.
This Senate campaign has tormented both national political parties, become a laboratory for what is widely seen as a new racial politics and troubled many people in a state with a legendary tolerance for politicians who push the limits.
''It's just giving Louisiana a bad name,'' said Brian Richardson, an independent insurance agent who stalked into the hall where Mr. Duke spoke to complain about the campaign signs outside. ''It's just a shame.''
Many political analysts here say that Mr. Duke's support has peaked, that he has suffered from several weeks of news accounts and television advertising about his past. Mr. Johnston has a particularly graphic spot on the air right now that shows Mr. Duke at a cross-burning in the late 1970's, giving a stiff-arm salute and chanting, ''White victory.''
 
Often on the Defensive
The 40-year-old Mr. Duke has tried to present much of his past activity as the excesses of youth, but he has been continually on the defensive. A televised debate this weekend with the Republicans' endorsed candidate, State Senator Ben Bagert Jr., a New Orleans lawyer who is running a distant third, turned into a shouting match.
''What the heck have you ever done with your life?'' Mr. Bagert yelled at Mr. Duke. ''All you've been able to do is burn a cross.''
A red-faced Mr. Duke, at one point, shouted, ''Let me finish, let me finish, let me finish!'' as Mr. Bagert jabbed at him again and again.
Still, what is striking to many people here is how well Mr. Duke has been able to do in the polls despite his past. And there is widespread speculation that polling may not be accurately registering his support, that there may be a hidden Duke vote.
A poll by the University of New Orleans's Survey Research Center, conducted Sept. 4-12, showed Mr. Johnston at 46 percent, Mr. Duke at 21 percent and Mr. Bagert at 8 percent. Another 20 percent were undecided, and 5 percent refused to state a preference.
The survey was based on interviews with 868 people who described themselves as registered voters and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
Among whites, Mr. Johnston was at 38 percent and Mr. Duke at 27 percent. Susan Howell, director of the center, said Mr. Duke's support was about the same among those who described themselves as Democrats, independents and Republicans. But it varied sharply with education, with Mr. Duke strongest among whites without a high school degree and weakest among college graduates.
 
Fertile Ground for Appeal
Many Louisianans say their state's long siege of economic troubles has created fertile ground for an appeal that assails both affirmative action and ''the rising welfare underclass.'' They also suggest that this message could easily be transferred to other pockets of economic distress.
''This is the Wallace movement revisited,'' said Lawrence Powell, a history professor at Tulane University who is a founder of the Louisiana Coalition Against Racism and Nazism, a group formed after Mr. Duke's upset election to the State Senate last year. ''These are the progeny of the Wallace voters.''
There was much anger among those who gathered to hear Mr. Duke in Lake Charles on Saturday night. ''Personally, I'm tired of working to pay for people who don't want to work - not can't, just don't want to,'' said Danny Thibodeaux, a refinery worker. ''People are tired of paying for the deadheads, be they black, white, orange or green.''
Another man, who like several others interviewed refused to give his name, said, ''I'm not on welfare and I don't draw food stamps, and if I had to, I'd probably have to stand at the end of the line because there'd probably be a black person up there telling me I couldn't get them.''
In an interview, Mr. Duke said his election would create ''thousands of Dukes'' in politics. He said his campaign would open the door for candidates and citizens to say what they had feared to say publicly before.
 
'Something Scary'
His opponents say that is exactly the problem. ''Just because people think these things doesn't make it right to say it out loud,'' said Beth Rickey, a member of the Republican State Central Committee and an opponent of Mr. Duke. ''There's something scary about the political climate right now.''
The anxiety of the anti-Duke forces is stoked by what many analysts have described as an anti-incumbent mood that could benefit outsiders this year -like John R. Silber of Massachusetts, who won the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in an upset earlier this month.
They worry about voters like the female state employee who chatted with a reporter in Baton Rouge this week, in the shadow of the towering memorial to Huey P. Long. The woman, who spoke on the condition that she not be identified, described herself as a liberal who voted for Walter F. Mondale for President in 1984 but who also intended to vote for Mr. Duke.
''It's sending a message that we're fed up with establishment politics,'' she said. ''We need another party. The Democrats have totally lost touch with people.''
Still, Geoffrey Garin, the poll taker for Mr. Johnston, said he believed that such voters were having second thoughts. ''Duke was a place-holder for a lot of angry voters,'' Mr. Garin said. ''He spoke to their anger pretty well. But I think in the past couple weeks those voters have been forced to take a harder look at Duke and they've become less comfortable.''
 
Campaigning on Record
Mr. Johnston is closing his campaign with reminders of the benefits of seniority and his record of attracting Federal dollars to Louisiana. With his television advertising, he is also forcefully reminding voters of Mr. Duke's Klan background.
Mr. Bagert, the official Republican candidate, is hoping that lightning will strike and is trying to fight the psychology that the way to stop Mr. Duke is to vote for Mr. Johnston.
For many Republicans the Duke campaign has posed an agonizing dilemma. The national party has repeatedly denounced Mr. Duke and is horrified at the prospect of a runoff election in which Mr. Duke is the de facto Republican standard-bearer. While Mr. Bagert has run a consistent, distant third in the polls, he could pull enough votes to make it impossible for Mr. Johnston to win more than 50 percent of the vote. As a result, Mr. Bagert contends, the national party has pulled away from his candidacy.
A spokeswoman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee said that the organization had given money to Mr. Bagert, but that he also needed to demonstrate he could raise money elsewhere.
The Republican tensions were further underscored when Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, a Republican, took the unusual step of coming into Louisiana last weekend to campaign for Mr. Johnston.
Mr. Bagert, in an interview last week, blasted the ''mealy mouthed, wimpy approach'' of many politicians to Mr. Duke and said it come back to haunt them.
''This guy's not going to go away,'' Mr. Bagert said. ''He could get run over by a car tonight and others will spring up. The cookie cutter's there now.''

HEADLINE: You Can Get Shot Outside of New York, Too;
Civilian Among Police

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The plan of New York City's Police Commissioner, Lee P. Brown, to relieve police officers from desk duty by using civilians (news article, Sept. 19) is commendable. However, by emphasizing that the civilian pay is much lower than that of officers, he does himself a disservice.
During an economic dry spell in the early 1980's, I took the police exam for police administrative aide, passed and spent a month training at the Police Academy. Luckily for me, my home precinct, where I had volunteered as an auxiliary, requested I be assigned there, and the academy complied. The hours were 11:30 P.M. to 7:30 A.M., including weekends and holidays, and the pay was $12,300, less Patrolmen's Benevolent Association dues and the usual state, city and Federal taxes. The net pay was not enough to meet expenses, so I worked two jobs. I understand the pay now is closer to $20,000. There was no differential for the night shift, and still isn't; it was all that was available for a newcomer. 
The work included dealing with the public, from wealthy people whose homes may have been broken into, or car radios stolen, to helping poor neighborhood people. Much of it was face to face, although the phones were always ringing. There was also paperwork for the complaints and, at night, tabulating and recording all incidents. There was no computer in the precinct house, and the old manual typewriter had cigarette butts buried among the keys.
I met disdain from the police officers and animosity from colleagues, generally from minorities, who believed an educated white was taking a job a minority person should have had. Despite the problems, the job was fun, and I gained a new admiration and respect for the police. The odds against them - whether on the beat, car patrol or undercover - can be awesome. Once they accepted me, they were a wonderful bunch to work with, and the experience of working with the public was an education.
However, I would not go back. The pay is too low, with no incentive to do a good job. Many people use the precinct house to vent their anger, taking precious time away from grave complaints. The job also has a high frustration level, because so many complaints, abuses and injuries repeat themselves, despite community outreach programs to educate people against leaving themselves open to thefts, muggings, robberies and other crime. These matters need to be addressed when more civilians are added. And the pay must be increased.

HEADLINE: Metro Matters;
Note to the U.N.: Talk to Jonas And Jonathan

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
As heads of state were arriving for the World Summit for Children at the United Nations over the weekend, Jonathan and Jonas Cosme were trying to hold their own.
For several weeks, they have been living in a converted Social Security office on East 151st Street in a largely industrial section of the Bronx. The House of Detention for Men is one block downhill. A peeling sign identifies their building as a ''Family Respite Center,'' a dormitory run by the city's Human Resources Administration. It is supposed to accommodate 189 people, but often has to house more overnight. Jonathan, Jonas and their mother sleep on cots flanking a crib that belongs to the boys' 21-month-old sister. 
Metro-North commuter trains rumble by periodically. But most of the noise is indigenous: a wailing toddler; a blaring radio; an altercation over privacy, of which there is none, or over some missing possession. Staff members do their best to maintain decorum. They provide new arrivals with clothing when necessary. They serve three meals a day. Two teachers help with homework several afternoons a week when many youngsters watch television because there is no safe place outside to play.
The average stay in the center is 17 days, but many residents remain for weeks or more, waiting for the city to find them an apartment. It is only when the children talk about where they had been living before that the respite center lives up to its name.
''We were with our grandmother and grandfather on Anderson Avenue,'' said Jonas Cosme, who is 12 years old, a year older than Jonathan. ''But about a year ago they were moving to Puerto Rico so we had to leave, too. Then we were living on Summit Avenue in a rented room. The lady there was putting glass in the food and Clorox in our milk. Our mother got mad. But we had no place else to go.''
Jonas visited the United Nations once on a school trip, but he said the other day that he had not heard about the summit for children. Chances are, too many officials attending the summit have little first-hand knowledge of children like Jonathan and Jonas and others who are worse off. Every statistic in a city with more than seven million people can be overwhelming. To quantify the challenges faced by many young people can be even more daunting.
AIDS is the No. 1 cause of death among children 1 to 4 years old. About 500 infants infected with the HIV virus were born last year. The infant mortality rate, 13.3 per 1,000 live births citywide, ranged from 6.6 in Flushing to 23.5 in Central Harlem.
The number of new mothers who use illegal drugs has increased from 7 per 1,000 live births in 1980 to 34 per 1,000 last year - a figure widely believed to be understated. Fully a third of those mothers produced babies whose low birth weights may signal physical and learning problems. Crack-addicted mothers also gave birth to about 1 in 20 of the youngsters who began kindergarten last month.
Of the 132,226 babies born in New York City in 1988, more than 1 in 10 had received little or no prenatal care, 4 in 10 were born out of wedlock and 1 in 10 were born to teen-age mothers. More than a third of the mothers were eligible for Medicaid. In Central Harlem, 8 in 10 births were out of wedlock. In East Harlem, nearly 2 in 10 were to teen-age mothers and the infant mortality rate among blacks was 42.2 per thousand.
Last year, 10,059 children under the age of 16 were arrested for committing felonies. Also in 1989, 270 homicide victims were 19 years old or younger. There were 55,417 reports of child abuse. In the first nine months of this year, nine bystanders under the age of 16 have been shot dead.
More than 45,000 New York City youngsters are in foster care. About a third of all students never finish high school. Among teen-agers still looking for work, one-fourth are unemployed. More than 480,000 children are on welfare. Half the children born in New York this year, according to one estimate, will be on welfare by the time they are 20 years old. More than 6,000 children, like Jonathan and Jonas Cosme, are homeless. On the eve of the United Nations meeting, the boys offered their own agenda. ''Stop the drugs,'' Jonathan said. ''Stop the child abuse,'' Jonas said. ''And crime,'' Jonathan said. ''Give us someplace to live,'' Jonas said.
The boys sat on their collapsible cots, watching as two men assembled a crib and as guards separated two women who were arguing. Living in their respite center in the South Bronx, they are a lot closer to United Nations headquarters than the children of any foreign country, but a long way from the summit.

HEADLINE: A Protected 'Greenway' Proposed Along the Hudson

BYLINE: By HAROLD FABER

DATELINE: HUDSON, N.Y.

 BODY:
High on the lawn of Olana, a popular tourist attraction in the Hudson Valley, David S. Sampson looked south to a panorama of green on both sides of the Hudson River, framed by the Catskill Mountains to the west.
''That's what we are trying to protect,'' he said, with a wave of his hand toward the view preserved in scores of sketches by Frederic Edwin Church, the artist who built the Moorish-style castle Olana as his home. ''Some of the prettiest land in the Hudson Valley is out there without any zoning to protect it.''
Mr. Sampson is executive director of the Hudson River Greenway Council, which has just issued a draft plan to protect the scenic beauty of the Hudson Valley, the fastest-growing area in the state, against industrial, commercial and housing development.
 
Time 'to Think Regionally'
''We believe it is time for the Hudson River Valley to think regionally and to act regionally,'' the council said. 
The council called for establishing a ''greenway'' in the Hudson Valley, a permanent greenway council to oversee development within five miles of the river and a Hudson River Trail from the Battery in Manhattan to the Mohawk River north of Albany. Environmental groups endorsed the proposals, but many local officials, while approving the concept of a greenway, strongly opposed any action to establish another layer of government, like a greenway council, that might erode home rule.
Under the council's proposal, the new greenway would encompass 12 counties in a 155-mile stretch of the valley, from New York City north to Troy and Albany, including cities, suburbs and rural areas. The heart of the plan, however, is the eight-county area north of suburban Westchester and Rockland Counties and south of Troy.
The greenway was defined as a geographic area that linked ''parks and protected areas, rivers and bodies of water, urban cultural parks and historic sites and scenic settings by means including trails, waterways and scenic highways.''
Within the greenway, the council recommended creating a Hudson River Trail - in reality two walking trails, one on each side of the river - loosely connecting those parks and open spaces.
 
Completion by the Year 2000
Such a trail, the council said, would ''bring a sense of the river back to its inhabitants and visitors.'' It set the year 2000 as a target date for completion.
In its most controversial proposal, it also called for legislation to create a permanent Hudson River Valley greenway council to review and approve projects within sight of the river and to coordinate planning by local and state agencies.
''The Hudson River Valley now stands at a crossroads,'' the council's draft report said. ''Its open space is disappearing. If present trends continue, all farming in the valley will be gone within 35 years.''
Without action to protect open spaces and agriculture, while at the same time fostering economic development, the valley could become ''the largest suburb ever built in New York State,'' the council said.
 
Public Hearings Being Held
The present 19-member council, whose chairman is Barnabas McHenry, a lawyer from New York City, was created by the State Legislature two years ago. It is due to report to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the Legislature in December.
The council's recommendations have been presented at a series of five public hearings so far, with other meetings Tuesday in Beacon, Oct. 10 in Albany and Oct. 14 in New York City.
At present the Hudson River waterfront comprises a medley of governments: cities, towns and villages, as well as the counties. Some of the small towns and villages do not have zoning laws to regulate growth, and others are governed by part-time officials who have to turn to outside expensive engineering and legal support when facing increasing developmental pressure.
The council's draft report was vague about how the greenway concept would affect the major urban areas of Manhattan and the Bronx, but it noted that both fronted on the Hudson and had parks that could easily be included in the Hudson River Trail. City officials had asked to be included in the greenway because of the riverfront trail concept.
 
Population on the Rise
Although the Hudson River begins in Lake Tear of the Clouds in the Adirondack Mountains and ends 315 miles south in New York Harbor, the Hudson Valley is generally defined as the eight counties between Westchester County and Troy: Putnam, Dutchess, Columbia, Rennselaer, Orange, Ulster, Greene and Albany.
Largely because of an influx of people moving north from metropolitan New York, the population of those eight counties has grown about 7 percent in the last 10 years, more than the state average, to 1,360,910, according to preliminary figures from the 1990 Census, up from 1,278,232 in 1980.
With the increased population, the character of the Hudson Valley is changing. Tourism and agriculture remain the main industries, but dairy farming is declining and tourism is increasing.
As visible signs of the change, many farms are giving way to second homes and suburban-type housing, while every riverfront community has seen an explosion of antique shops, restaurants and boutiques.
 
Overdevelopment Feared
''What we want to do is to avoid the problems of overdevelopment, as we have seen in Long Island,'' said Maurice D. Hinchey, chairman of the State Assembly's Environment Committee, who introduced the legislation creating the present greenway council. ''We want to avoid overpopulation, traffic congestion and a general decline in the quality of life.''
At present the riverfront is a mixture of development and open space, with lavish estates in some areas and marshes and abandoned piers in others. A traveler up the river sees a panorama of green foliage at this time of year, dotted by apartment houses, parks, industrial plants, power plants, historic homes, country estates and religious institutions.
The river is flanked by railroad tracks on both sides, with high-speed Amtrak trains and slower commuter Metro-North trains using the east bank and freight trains the west bank. Because of the tracks and private ownership of much of the adjacent land, public access to the river is limited.
Despite that, the river is the focus of the tourist industry, with millions of visitors a year streaming into attractions like Sunnyside in Westchester, Bear Mountain State Park, West Point, the Franklin D. Roosevelt home in Hyde Park, the Vanderbilt mansion and Ogden D. Mills mansion farther north and Olana here in Columbia County - all on knolls with river views.
To protect those and other river views, the council proposed establishing a primary riverside area stretching back about 5 1/2 miles on either bank, with a secondary countryside area encompassing the rest of the counties. The council said its initial recommendations centered on the riverside area.
For that area, it proposed the adoption of a Hudson River Compact, an agreement by the 12 counties and 82 municipalities bordering the river. The compact would have three components: local governments cooperating among themselves, the new greenway council to coordinate programs and a new greenway conservancy to provide technical and financial assistance.
Even though the present council denied that it had any intention of setting up a ''supergovernment,'' many local officials said the new greenway council would be just that if it had the power to review and approve local planning and to act as the lead agency in required environmental impact reviews.
''It is simply not necessary to create a new regional agency in the Hudson Valley,'' said Roland Vosburgh, a senior planner in Columbia County, reflecting the opinion of most county planners. ''We would suggest that the counties are the ideal sub-regional level of government and should continue to coordinate technical assistance to local government.''
Critics of the proposals also raised questions - as they have in the Adirondack Park - about an elite group seeking to put scenic beauty above economic development and jobs for local residents. They have also questioned the costs, financing and impact on local landowners.
As one step to ease local fears, the council suggested a referendum, with the new compact not becoming effective unless approved by a majority of voters in two-thirds of the local governmental units in the riverside area. In addition Mr. Sampson said the new greenway council would have a majority of local officials as its members.
So far Mr. Sampson and his associates have not come up with any cost estimates. He said initial funds for organization would come from the $1.9 billion 1990 Environmental Quality Bond Act, if it is passed by the voters in November, with administrative costs being covered later by the state.
''I don't think it will cost very much,'' Mr. Hinchey said. ''But I do know that the costs of not acting will be far greater. It will cost much more to try to solve the problems we are trying to avoid - the problems of congestion, water and air pollution - and of maintaining the quality of life in the valley.''

HEADLINE: 15th 52d Street Festival Is Packed, Man, but Fluid

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN

 BODY:
Gridlock? Nightmare? Traffic seizing up and choking New York City like a huge chicken bone in its throat?
''No problem, man, no problem,'' Michael Jackson, a cart-wheeling vendor of hot dogs and other staples, concluded as he stood yesterday on 51st Street and surveyed the car flow down the Avenue of the Americas. ''The only problem is nobody is giving me any money. The festival took all the business.'' 
The culprit to which Mr. Jackson referred was pulsating just a block to the north, on 52d Street.
There, from Broadway to Lexington Avenue, thousands of people -tens of thousands probably - heard the threats of horrific diplomatically generated traffic and blatantly ignored them to shop, bop and eat at New York's oldest city-run street fair.
 
A 'Mellow' Occasion
''Very mellow,'' Police Officer Bobby Heedles said, making it sort of official. Raising his voice over the usual Sunday din of Seventh Avenue traffic, Officer Heedles added, ''It's not even noisy.''
Behind the lack of panic over the United Nation's World Summit for Children, its 70 world leaders, their entourages and their limos, was a clear, scientific explanation, said Mort Berkowitz, the 51-year-old organizer of the 15th Annual 52d Street Americana Festival.
''When the police tell you it's going to be excessive gridlock - excessive - basically you know it's going to be O.K.,'' he said. ''Basically what it means when the police and everybody warn everybody is that they will heed that warning, and thus I know I can drive into New York.''
As to the crowds who, according to his theory, should have stayed home in terror of traffic, Mr. Berkowitz could only assume that other New Yorkers shared his grounding in gridlock theory.
 
More People 'Than Ever'
''There are truthfully more people here than ever before,'' he said. But he declined to ''play numbers'' and count them.
Still, caution seemed to float as thick as Italian-sausage smoke on the wind over 52d Street.
At Seventh Avenue it was widely suspected that the brave people defying the dire predictions were tourists flowing out of the Sheraton, Omni and other hotels nearby. And some were.
But just a few straw baskets and thick-knit sweaters east of the corner was Steve Abrams, an optometrist all the way in from Massapequa, L.I.
''He just likes going out with two women at the same time,'' explained Sharon Lewis, one of two at Mr. Abrams's side.
A block and a half east, a Soviet emigre, Andrei Bogoslowskiy, 24, wasn't even sure what the fuss was supposed to be about.
''United Nations? What United Nations?'' he asked as he swapped T-shirts with ''exclusive'' Russian designs for American money, two for $20.
After hearing of the global forum's summit meeting on children, Mr. Bogoslowskiy insisted, ''I am not involved in politics.''
 
Sales Not Outstanding
That the fair was titled ''Americana'' seemed at best anachronistic. American Airlines, the Americana Hotel and American Express ended their sponsorship some time ago, Mr. Berkowitz said. And like Mr. Bogoslowskiy, many vendors seemed to prove that the farther their products had traveled, the better they sold.
Benjamin Agbaniyaka, for instance, seemed to be doing a fantastic business in straw bowls from Burkina Faso, wooden bowls from northern Morocco and wedding baskets from his native Nigeria. He esteemed his sales only fair, however, and cast the blame on culture rather than traffic.
''Not like in the Village, man,'' he said, meaning Greenwich. ''In the Village they are artists, and they appreciate art. People around here are more conservative.''
Chuck Sommers, who was selling rubber nose-masks (a pig-nose, a dog-nose, a shark-nose) and blood-stained rubber hands with fingers that gyrated mechanically as though possessed, joined the quiet chorus of the less-than-satisfied.
''We usually do $300 in noses, $500 in hands, but business has been off really about a third over the past few weeks,'' he said. ''I don't think it's the gridlock thing. I think everybody's into this recession mode.''
 
Animal Rights Defended
Nancy Restuccia, by contrast, was saying, ''The numbers are just unbelievable!'' But she was talking about something else.
Ms. Restuccia, a Manhattan executive recruiter, was talking about the legion of stray dogs and cats filling New York City streets because of what she considered ill-considered government animal policies.
On behalf of an animal-rights group, she was collecting signatures on a petition for low-cost pay-and-neuter clinics for wayward canines and felines.
The flow of petition signers? She frowned.
''We've probably had about a hundred and a quarter, signature-wise,'' she said. ''But every little bit helps.''

HEADLINE: Shouts of Revolt Rise Up In Congressional Ranks

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Even before President Bush and Congressional leaders had finished their sales pitch for the budget compromise, dozens of rank-and-file members today attacked it as unacceptable. Republicans were angry about the tax increases, and Democrats derided the cuts in domestic spending.
''It's dead in the water,'' said Representative Nick Joe Rahall, Democrat of West Virginia. ''The package as I see it now does not go far enough in requiring the wealthy to pay their fair share.'' 
Emerging halfway through a briefing of House Republicans on the plan, Representative Philip M. Crane of Illinois had his mind made up. ''We are being taxed at all-time high levels,'' he said. ''This is the most inauspicious time I can think of to raise taxes.''
Declaring that he was ''totally opposed'' to the package, Mr. Crane added, ''You bet it's an easy vote.''
While they emphasized the importance of passing a budget package, many members who are not part of the Congressional leadership were reluctant to commit themselves to voting for it.
 
'Pledges Have Been Made'
''We are not the Radio City Rockettes that march in perfect precision,'' said Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, one of the more influential Republicans. ''Every fiber in my being wants to support it. But at the same time, pledges have been made, and I want to use my own judgment.''
Anticipating the opposition of rank-and-file members, Senate and House leaders at the White House ceremony today sought to promote the package as too crucial to the nation's well-being to be undermined by partisan sniping.
Representative Thomas S. Foley of Washington, the House Speaker, acknowledged that finding majorities in both parties in both houses of Congress would be difficult. But he added, ''we pledge our efforts with yours to convince our colleagues and the country that this is strong undergirding of our economic future, our national prosperity and joint national interests.''
The nation's well-being was also the centerpiece of a pitch by Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader.
''The naysayers, the nit-pickers may have a field day because the easy vote in this case is to find something you don't like and vote no,'' the Kansan said. ''But in my view, we owe more to the American people than finding fault with what I consider to be a good agreement.''
 
Looking Past Cynicism
Mr. Dole went on to say that the package will ''demonstrate to the American people, who are sometimes somewhat cynical, that the Congress and the President of the United States can work together, and we can look ahead, and we can do the right thing for our country.''
But the words of unity sounded hollow to many lawmakers, coming after months of bickering among the parties, the White House and Congress over the details of a deficit-reducing budget. It was just a few days ago that President Bush was attacking Congressional Democrats for lack of an agreement, and the Democrats were assailing him for not negotiating in what they saw as good faith.
''I think the leadership on both sides are going to have to do substantial lobbying to get the package passed,'' said Representative Ralph Regula, Republican of Ohio. ''There are no pleasant choices. This is not something where people say, 'Boy, I did this vote for me.' There is not a partisan gain in either party.''
Mr. Dole implored his colleagues on the Senate floor this evening to ''give us an opportunity to explain it'' before passing judgment on the plan. Yet few members seem interested in heeding his plea.
''It's going to be one hell of a debate,'' Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, said on the Senate floor this evening.
''Oh, I think more than that,'' Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader, responded with a smile.
 
No Mood for Jokes
But most members were in no joking mood.
''I think its lousy,'' Representative Charles B. Rangel, a Manhattan Democrat and one of the most liberal members, said of the compromise. ''It impacts too heavily on the services to Medicare recipients. It impacts too heavily on the lower and middle income recipients.''
Asked if he would vote against the package, he said, ''That's without question.''
On the other side of the aisle, one of the most conservative members was just as angry.
''It looks like a road map to recession,'' said Representative Dana Rohrabacher, Republican of California. ''I think it's a cave-in to the liberal Democrats. This is totally irresponsible, and the system has broken down.''
Representative Robert S. Walker, Republican of Pennsylvania Republican, agreed. ''It's a package where the Republicans did the giving and the Democrats did the taking,'' he said. ''The fact is, the Democrats turned out to be ruthless bargainers.''
One of the few conservatives who did not attack the plan was Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip. He was conspicuously absent from the White House ceremony where Mr. Bush and Congressional leaders announced their agreement today. He refused to discuss the plan as he walked in and out of a meeting with House Republicans, saying only, ''Still looking at it, still looking at it.''
But privately, members and aides said Mr. Gingrich was furious about the agreement, notably the tax increases.
Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the Republican leader, refused to discuss Mr. Gingrich's concerns, saying, ''He has his reasons.'' He said, however, that he had anticipated the conservative opposition and believed it could be overcome.
Much of the outcry against the package was clearly intended for home consumption, with House members and a third of the Senate facing re-election campaigns in November. Republicans who have spent months campaigning with the theme of ''no new taxes'' surely would not favor the plan, nor Democrats who could be accused of voting to slash domestic programs.
Congressional officials said privately that they hoped to win enough support for the agreement so members facing close races would have the freedom to oppose the package.

HEADLINE: Where the Budget Agreement Would Be Felt the Most

 BODY:

The Military
Although the budget agreement would cut military spending more than the Pentagon initially wanted, it would be a victory of sorts for the Defense Department. The agreement would leave the military with more than Pentagon officials expected to get from this year's budget negotiations on Capitol Hill, and it appears to provide a three-year reprieve from the House's efforts to make even more drastic cuts in military expenditures.
The figures for military spending in 1991 do not include the costs of the Persian Gulf operation. The costs are estimated at $15 billion for the 1991 fiscal year, and that figure would rise astronomically if warfare broke out. About half the estimated amount is to come from foreign contributions.
Apart from the gulf crisis, Pentagon spending for the 1991 fiscal year would be set at $297 billion, representing a cut of nearly $10 billion from what the Bush Administration initially sought. That would mean a reduction of 8 percent from the 1990 budget, after inflation. Spending would be cut a further 3 percent in 1991 and 3.5 percent in 1992, according to initial estimates. The Pentagon had proposed a cut of 2 percent in the next fiscal year. 
Military officials appeared to be relatively satisfied with the results. The figures in the agreement cover three years and are essentially those contained in a military budget that was approved by the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this year.
The House Armed Services Committee had approved a significantly lower level of spending for the Pentagon, and military officials were resigned to seeing the Senate figure reduced in negotiations between the two chambers.
Thus, the budget agreement, at first look, seems to leave the military with the best of all the likely outcomes. Still, there is a great deal of negotiation remaining on how to apportion the money. There is no agreement over funding for the radar-evading B-2 bomber, the rail-based MX intercontinental missile and other major projects.
 
Transportation
Many previous fuel and ticket taxes have been set aside for transportation-re lated spending.
That would change under the budget compromises, with increases in the taxes used for reducing the deficit instead of for new transportation projects.
The agreement would increase the Federal tax on each gallon of gasoline by 10 cents a gallon, on top of the 9-cent tax that is now collected. But unlike revenue from the current tax, receipts from the new ones would not be put into a trust fund to pay for Federal highway programs and for mass-transit grants to cities and states. Instead, at least some of the money will be counted as general revenue and used to reduce the deficit.
The United States used about 300 million gallons of gasoline a day last year, so each penny of tax increase brings in about $1 billion, although the budget negotiators calculated a slightly lower figure.
When fully phased in, the 10-cents-a-gallon increase would raise the cost of driving the average car one mile by about half a cent; in new cars, which use less gasoline, it would raise the cost about a third of a cent. The average car uses about 500 gallons of gasoline a year, meaning that the cost would be about $60 annually.
In addition to the gasoline tax increase, the agreement calls for a new 2-cents-per-gallon tax on petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel fuel, aviation gasoline, jet fuel and kerosene, among others. Together, with the other 10-cent-a-gallon increase, the total tax on a gallon of gasoline would rise by 12 cents.
Products not used as transportation fuel, like home heating oil, asphalt and lubricants, would not be subject to this tax. It would be paid by the refiner or importer, as opposed to the gasoline tax, which is paid by the motorist. It is to go into effect Jan. 1 and is expected to raise $1.4 billion next year and $11.8 billion over five years.
Similarly, aviation programs are paid for primarily with ticket taxes, fuel taxes, airport departure fees and other charges. The user fees are held in an aviation trust fund. The Administration has been asking Congress to accelerate both the collection of fees and the spending out of the fund in the next few years.
The agreement includes a number of aviation taxes. It raises the tax on the price of a passenger ticket from 8 percent to 10 percent. But it does not allow the Federal Aviation Agency to use the money to build new airports, instead allocating the revenue for the deficit reduction.
 
Cigarettes and Alcohol
The agreement to raise excise taxes on cigarettes and alcohol would mean relatively modest price increases for consumers.
Starting next year, smokers would pay 20 cents in taxes on a pack of cigarettes, up from 16 cents. A pack now costs an average of $1.60.
An four-cent rise is proposed for 1993.
The beer tax would double, to $18 a barrel, which is roughly 52 six-packs of beer. That would mean drinkers would pay 32 cents in taxes on a six-pack, up from 16 cents. A six-pack of beer typically sells for between $3 and $4.
Drinkers of wine and spirits will also pay more. Taxes on a 750-milliliter bottle of table wine, that with an alcohol content of up to 14 percent, will rise to 25 cents from 3 cents. Liquor taxes would rise $1.20, to $13.70 a gallon.
Over five years, cigarette taxes are expected to raise $5.9 billion in revenue, and alcohol taxes $10 billion.
These proposed tax increases are likely to hurt sales of beer and cigarettes in the short run, but for the long term they might spur sales of discount products that are also very profitable, industry spokesmen said. But for the more expensive wine and spirits, sales, which were already declining, may be hurt even more, analysts said.
 
Housing
The budget agreement appeared to offer major policy victories to Jack F. Kemp, the Housing Secretary, by pledging to establish urban enterprise zones and to change the structure of the Government's troubled mortgage insurance program for single-family homes.
In addition, the agreement promised to continue the low-income housing tax credit, which gives tax breaks to developers in exchange for producing low-cost housing.
''This is good news from the perspective of HUD,'' said Mary S. Brunette, chief spokeswoman at the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
The changes in the mortgage insurance program, run by the Federal Housing Administration, have been the focus of a Congressional dispute, now in conference committee.
After discovering the program was losing about $350 million a year, Mr. Kemp proposed changes, adopted by the Senate, that would limit the amount of closing costs that borrowers could finance and would charge higher premiums to buyers with low down payments. He estimated that 15,000 to 35,000 fewer families a year would be able to purchase homes under this plan, a reduction of 2 percent to 5 percent.
An alternative passed by the House and backed by the mortgage-banking industry would have changed the fee structure for all borrowers, not just those with low down payments.
Mr. Kemp's version, adopted by the budget negotiators, promises to raise more money. While the agreement is not binding on the rest of Congress, the leadership has made clear it will strongly resist changes. seeming to insure victory for Mr. Kemp's approach.
The agreement also provides $100 million in the first fiscal year, 1992, for enterprise zones, which Mr. Kemp has long championed as a means of fighting poverty. The money represents a revenue loss from tax breaks offered to businesses in inner cities. The allocation is higher than the $56 million initially sought by Mr. Kemp to establish 25 such zones.
Ms. Brunette said the details of the enterprise zone agreement were not immediately available, but she said she anticipated that the department probably would designate such zones through a competitive process, based on indices of poverty and urban distress.
In addition, the budget agreement provides $200 million in housing tax credits, which is roughly this year's allocation. It grows to $400 million in fiscal year 1993 and remains there in subsequent years. Mr. Kemp had sought a higher allocation that would have reached $1.6 billion by 1994.
Alfred A. DelliBovi, the department Under Secretary, said he was not certain how the department's other programs would be affected, but added, ''what we're anticipating is the basic level of services that we've had.''
 
Business
The budget agreement includes several incentives for businesses that President Bush said were designed to stimulate economic growth.
Among them are measures to increase the tax credit for research and development, establish a tax credit for companies that situate businesses in economically depressed areas and a 25 percent tax deduction on the purchase of new stock in certain new companies.
Such a break aiding venture capitalists, who provide the money for new enterprises, was described by some tax analysts as a way to give a capital gains break to a smaller set of investors.
Another new incentive would be the indexing for inflation of new stock in certain companies. For taxing purposes, the purchaser would be able to adjust for inflation and would be allowed to report only the real gain.
The research and development tax credit would rise to 30 percent from 20 percent. The credit applies to the incremental increase spent on research and development from the prior year.
The new budget proposals would also enhance the tax benefits of investment in tangible and scientific equipment. It would allow some companies to write off depreciation in a year rather than over a longer period, thereby lowering the cost of capital purchases by reducing the tax bite.
 
Medicare
Medicare, the giant health insurance program that covers 33 million elderly and disabled Americans, would receive the biggest cut of any domestic program as a result of the agreement. Of the $119 billion called for in domestic spending cuts over the next five years, $60 billion, or about half the total amount, would be realized through reductions in the program.
Half the savings are to be achieved through holding down hospital costs and doctors fees, which have been averaging a 15 percent annual increase in the decade. The other half of the savings is to be realized by increasing the premiums and the deductible paid by those participating in the program.
That prospect has already led to protests from some groups representing the elderly. ''No question, this is waging war on seniors and the disabled,'' said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA, an advocacy group for older people.
Under the agreement, the vast majority of older people would see the premium they pay for Medicare coverage for physicians' fees rise in stages from the current $28.60 a month to $54.30 month in 1995.
In addition, the deductible, the amount that recipients must pay before additional costs are paid for by Medicare, would double over five years to $150 a year from the current $75.
The 3.3 million elderly who live below the poverty level, which is currently set at $5,947 for a single person over 65 years of age, will continue to be eligible for free health insurance under the Medicaid program. In addition, negotiators set aside $2 billion over five years to help the 2.2 million elderly people whose incomes are up to 25 percent higher than the poverty line.

HEADLINE: Budget Pact Called Test Of Theories

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The long-awaited agreement on the budget deficit, announced yesterday in Washington, might finally test the economic thinking that for a decade has driven the White House, Congress and millions of Americans to advocate a sharp reduction in the deficit.
If the thesis behind budget-cutting is correct, then the interest rates that consumers and businesses are charged for a wide variety of loans should fall - not this week or next, perhaps, but by the end of the year they should be in a steady decline.
''Other things being equal - ignoring for the moment the rising oil prices, the banking system's weakness and the sluggish economy -then the budget agreement should lower interest rates, and eventually make stock prices rise,'' said Ed Yardeni, chief economist at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.
In the credit markets, the budget accord, which some analysts said had been expected, was played down as ''just a starting point.'' [Page D9.] Choking of Economy Seen Many economists, including Mr. Yardeni, hold that the budget deficit chokes the economy. Their argument is that the Federal Government, to finance deficits that have ranged above $200 billion a year sometimes, must borrow too much from the nation's pool of savings. The heavy drain leaves an inadequate amount for private borrowing, and the competition for limited funds drives up interest rates. 
The new agreement is billed by the Bush Administration as a big enough cut to reverse this process. As rates fall, the private sector, in theory at least, will increase its borrowing and spending, and this should stimulate economic growth, eventually making the stock market boom.
Certainly, the agreed-upon reduction of $500 billion over five years, if approved by Congress, is a huge amount, representing a reversal of Government practices. And the initial cut of $50 billion in the fiscal year that begins today dwarfs previous attempts to reduce the budget deficit. The biggest one-year budget cut to date was $27 billion in the 1980's.
But the thesis on which cutting the deficit is based runs into several problems, some practical and some theoretical. One of the problems is that Government spending on weaponry, highways, airports, Medicare, education, Social Security and other programs sustains the economy by creating jobs, income and demand for the products and materials produced by the private sector.
In addition, the higher taxes on gasoline, cigarettes, alcohol and luxury items that were announced as part of the agreement cut into household income now dedicated to spending. This further reduces demand, and just at a time when the economy is close to a recession.
''The agreement announced today is a moment of truth,'' said Robert Eisner, an economist at Northwestern University. ''If they go through with this reduction, they will deal a new blow to an economy already teetering near a recession.''
 
Risks Acknowledged
The budget-cutters, in Congress, the White House and the economics profession, acknowledge the risks of shrinking demand now. ''It would have been much better to have had the deficit reduction just after Bush took office in 1989,'' said Lawrence Summers, a Harvard economist. ''He had great political strength then and the economy was strong.''
Mr. Summers and others who applaud the budget agreement are counting on the Federal Reserve to offset the weak demand and the reduced Government spending by lowering interest rates, a power the Fed exercises by manipulating the nation's bank reserves. Their hope might be in vain.
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, points to two constraints. One is the dollar, which has weakened recently; the other is the Mideast crisis, which has pushed up the price of oil. Both developments are considered inflationary and the Fed has been countering their impact by freezing interest rates at current levels.
Strong rates help to keep a lid on prices by discouraging the borrowing that makes possible robust spending and investment, but the medicine also weakens the already weak economy.
''The timing of this agreement is bad,'' said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a bond trading house. ''I'm not saying that rates won't decline eventually, but the near-term impact on rates is likely to be negligible.''
The new agreement is also likely to test another aspect of the theory behind budget-cutting. Theory holds that when the deficit declines, the money that once financed it shifts to the private sector, where both savings and investment rise.
But this assumes a sufficiently robust economy to keep incomes from declining, Mr. Eisner argues. Recent Government data show that income, adjusted for inflation, has declined.
 
Worldwide Savings an Issue
Others argue that the budget deficit might free American savings for use by the private sector, but the real issue is worldwide savings.
For years, foreign funds, particularly from Japan, helped to finance the budget deficit through the purchase of billions of dollars in Treasury issues. But recently, demands for capital in both Japan and West Germany have drawn funds to those countries.

HEADLINE: Wall St. Endures a Painful Quarter

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
The stock market as a whole just finished one of its worst quarters ever. Virtually the only companies to show gains in a period dominated by crisis in the Persian Gulf were in natural resources, particularly oil.
''It was a difficult quarter,'' said Robert S. Salomon, director of stock research with Salomon Brothers Inc. ''If people didn't realize it before, higher oil prices made many people realize that there is a recession on the way. And interests rates have not fallen as you would expect in a period of economic weakness.'' 
 
Big Winners and Losers
Of the nearly 4,200 stocks tracked by Media General Financial Services, 3,744 were down in price for the third quarter, while only 370 were up. Sixty-one stocks were unchanged. According to Media General, 1,368 stocks on the New York Stock Exchange were down in price, while 155 were up and 19 were unchanged.
On the American Stock Exchange, 461 issues were down, while 62 were up and 5 remained unchanged. In over-the-counter trading, 1,915 stocks were down and 153 were up, with 37 unchanged.
The big winner on the Big Board was the Freeport-McMoran Copper Company, which explores for and mines copper in Indonesia. In July, the company announced an increase of 107 million metric tons in its proven ore reserves at one of its copper mines. The company, which is based in New Orleans, said the discovery would add reserves of 2.9 billion pounds of copper, 4.9 million ounces of gold and 5.9 million ounces of silver.
 
Bankruptcy Filing
The stock with the greatest decline was Prime Motor Inns Inc., a hotel company that last month filed for protection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the Federal Bankruptcy Code. The company in recent months sold its Howard Johnson, Ramada and Rodeway Inns franchises. Many analysts contend that Prime was too ambitious in its growth in the hotel business and had trouble handling its various properties. The company, based in Fairfield, N.J., had also said charges for the third quarter would lead to a substantial after-tax loss.
On the American exchange, the stock with the largest gain was Maxxam Inc. which in 1988 bought Kaisertech Ltd., the holding company for Kaiser Aluminum, and Kaiser, the nation's fourth-largest maker of aluminum. Maxxam has benefited in recent months from high aluminum prices and high demand for aluminum products.
 
Squeezing the Margins
The stock with the biggest decline on the American exchange was Catalina Lighting Inc., a Miami-based company that is one of the fastest growing importers and distributors of residential decorative lighting and ceiling fans. The company's results have been hurt by higher expenses and interest costs. Intensified competition in the industry has narrowed margins, pushing the company's earnings below expectations.
In over-the-counter trading, the largest gainer in the quarter was the Barden Corporation, a maker of bearing products, precision plastic moldings and metal stampings and assemblies. The company, based in Danbury, Conn., agreed two weeks ago to be acquired by the FAG Bearings Corporation, the American unit of a large West German bearings and industrial systems manufacturer, FAG Kugelfischer Georg Schaefer.
The purchase price for the deal was $66.50 a share, or $131.1 million. On the day of that agreement, Barden's stock soared $30 a share - a 94 percent gain - in over-the-counter trading, closing at $63.
The stock with the sharpest decline in over-the-counter trading was CM Communications Inc., an importer and designer of cellular telephones. The company, based in Panorama City, Calif., announced inventory write-offs in recent months from a subsidiary that ceased operations.
 
Energy Stocks Gain
Energy-related companies were prominent on the list of stocks gaining for the quarter. On the Big Board, Freeport McMoran Oil and Gas Company, an explorer and producer of crude oil and natural gas, was No. 3.
In the No. 4 spot was Western Gas Resources, the Denver-based holding company that owns a 52 percent stake in the natural gas company Western Gas Processors Ltd. Fifth was the Apache Corporation, a Denver-based company involved in oil and gas exploration.
On the American Stock Exchange, two of the top five gainers were energy related: the Beard Oil Company, an Oklahoma City-based oil and gas production company, and the Chiles Offshore Corporation, a Houston offshore drilling contractor.
''The energy service stocks have done well in the quarter,'' said Jerry M. Brooks, Chiles's vice president and chief financial officer. ''Of course, the events in the Middle East have had some impact. But there is the perception that prices will be on the upturn and that there will be more demand for services. That perception is what is causing energy-related stocks to rise.''
 
Oil's Impact
Higher oil prices worked against many companies, however. The stock of HAL Inc., the parent company of Hawaiian Airlines, posted the fourth-largest decline on the American Stock Exchange. Stephen Thompkins, HAL's vice president of administration, said the single biggest factor in the company's performance was higher jet fuel prices.
''Every penny increase in the price of fuel translates into another $1 million a year in operating expense,'' Mr. Thompkins said. ''For smaller airlines like ours the impact is much more severe than for the larger carriers.''
Still, companies whose stock declined followed no particular pattern. On the American exchange, for example, the third-largest declining stock was the Town and Country Corporation, a maker of fine jewelry and high school and college rings based in Chelsea, Mass. Analysts contend that the stock has fallen because of expectations of lower spending on luxury items at a time when the economy is slowing.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
TV Rerun Ownership In Review

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
The Government is moving toward loosening, and perhaps scrapping, longstanding rules that limit ownership by the three major television networks of programs they broadcast.
The restrictions are the subject of an expensive lobbying battle by the networks, which say they are being denied a crucial source of revenue, and by the Hollywood studios, which say the restrictions prevent the powerful networks from attaining a monopoly in program production. In 1983, the studios beat back an attempt to reduce the restrictions.
The current rules, adopted by the Federal Communications Commission in 1970 and known officially as the Financial Interest and Syndication Rules, came after the commission concluded that the networks had overwhelming market power in buying programs.
 
A $3 Billion Market
The rules bar the networks from owning a financial interest in more than a small percentage of the programs they run during prime time and prohibit them from selling those programs as reruns to local stations. The highly profitable rerun market is worth $3 billion annually and is one of the most lucrative parts of the television business. 
Movie studios and independent program producers, who have flourished under the current system, argue that the rules have kept the networks from exerting a stranglehold over them and stifling competition. If the restrictions are lifted, the studios, which produce or help finance more than half of all prime-time television programming, would immediately face three formidable new competitors who are now big customers.
 
Possible Acquisitions
Beyond losing enormous bargaining power, the studios and independent producers would also face the possibility of outright acquisition by the networks or of more in-house production of shows by the networks.
''We would effectively be employees of the networks,'' said Leonard Hill, an independent producer of television movies and mini-series. ''We would seemingly be flying our own flags, but we would become the equivalent of the Baltic states under the control of the networks.''
But network executives say that with advertising revenues under pressure from increased competition from other entertainment sources, including cable, they will not be able to bid competitively for high-quality programs if they cannot own the lucrative syndication rights as well. This situation, they say, will foster the migration of more shows from ''free'' television to pay television.
''Over time, you will have a two-class entertainment system,'' said Richard Cotton, executive vice president and general counsel for NBC. ''Pay cable will provide top-quality programming and free, over-the-air television will be a cut below that.''
 
Dictating Program Content
Hollywood's independent television producers argue that unleashing the networks would make television more bland. The reason: the networks would insist on owning a stake in the producers in return for running their shows and would be far more able to dictate the content of the shows. The producers say this would undermine producers who champion innovative, risk-taking shows that need time to build support.
''The networks are concerned about their ratings next week,'' said Mel Blumenthal, chief operating officer of MTM Enterprises, a production company in Los Angeles. ''They need their success today, immediately. Our success comes from developing programs that can last long enough to produce at least 100 episodes, enough to enter syndication. That requires long-term creative thinking, which is in tension with what the networks often want.''
 
Matter of Relevancy
Still, a growing number of regulators contend that the rules restricting the networks have become irrelevant and should be dropped.
''I have no particular interest in fighting yesterday's wars,'' Alfred C. Sikes, chairman of the F.C.C., said in a speech to producers in Los Angeles last week. ''Obviously, the networks still have power, but it is certainly less than the unchallenged hegemony they once enjoyed. Hollywood is not as dependent on the national networks as once was the case.''
Mr. Sikes and other top officials at the commission hope at least to loosen the rules significantly by early next year. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration, part of the Commerce Department, has urged a loosening that would retain some restrictions. But the Federal Trade Commission and the Justice Department have filed briefs calling for outright repeal, with the latter agency saying there is ''no basis in economic theory for a presumption that network ownership of financial interests and exercise of syndication rights could adversely affect program production.''
Equally important, members of Congress who are influential in this field, including Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan, and Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, are trying to stay out of the battle. Congress has the power to overrule F.C.C. actions.
 
Erosion of Network Power
Fears of the power of ABC, CBS and NBC became far less compelling in recent years as they steadily lost market share to cable television, independent stations and the new, fourth network created by the Fox Broadcasting Company. Since 1970, the three networks' share of prime-time viewers has tumbled to 65 percent from more than 90 percent.
At the same time, some of the nation's top movie studios have been acquired by large foreign corporations that sometimes dwarf the networks in size. The Sony Corporation acquired Columbia Pictures Entertainment earlier this year; Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation owns 20th Century Fox and the fledgling Fox Television Network, and the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company confirmed last week that it was in talks to buy MCA Inc., owner of Universal Studios, for $7.5 billion.
''We strongly believe that the politics have changed dramatically,'' said Mr. Cotton of NBC. ''Everyone who has looked at this from any objective third-party perspective has come to the conclusion that the rules should be changed.'' #20-Year-Old Rules Adopted by the F.C.C. 20 years ago, the rules prohibit the three big networks from acquiring financial interest or syndication rights in the programs they license for broadcast. Obtaining syndication rights to a prime-time series would allow the network to re-sell the programs it broadcasts to local stations as reruns. Program producers say these resale rights are the only way they have to recoup their investment, because the original license fees that networks pay usually do not cover production costs.
The F.C.C. rules are also bound up with a 1980 court decree limiting the networks to producing only five hours of prime-time programming a week on their own. While the restriction expires in November, the networks claim it will do them no additional good because of the ban on syndication rights.
One impetus for changing the rules occurred earlier this year, when Fox Broadcasting asked the commission to waive the rules for its new network. Coming from a company that owns a movie studio that holds syndication rights to many television reruns, the request confronted the commission with an issue it could not avoid. On the one hand, it wanted to encourage competition; on the other, it could not give the new network a permanent exemption without also loosening the rules for ABC, NBC and CBS.
 
Inability to Compromise
The issue was so politically difficult that in March, Mr. Sikes asked the opponents to negotiate a proposed set of rules. But the sides could not reach a compromise by the June deadline, and the commission is now planning to hold hearings in November or December to help officials come up with new rules by early next year.
Many in the industry expect some changes to be made. Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association of America, admitted that he has become resigned to ''some modification in the rules.''
The question, then, may become one of how much the rules would be changed. Some producers admit that while they are now heavily dependent for much of their financing on the eight major movie studios, they would be pleased to strike financing deals with the networks if adequate safeguards are in place.
''I want to negotiate with everybody,'' said Mr. Blumenthal of MTM Enterprises. ''But if I negotiate with the networks, I want some protection.''

HEADLINE: Business and the Law;
Corporate Crime And Punishment

BYLINE: By Stephen Labaton

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE Federal agency rewriting the rules for punishing corporations convicted of crimes has just come out with a set of principles that it hopes could become law sometime next year.
Set up six years ago by a Federal law, the United States Sentencing Commission has been groping for the last few years to produce a set of guidelines that it hopes will make sentencing more uniform nationwide.
At latest count, more than 350 companies are sentenced each year by Federal courts for criminal violations, and thousands more are sentenced by state courts. Most Federal cases are environmental disputes, although there has also been a growing number of fraud and white-collar cases. 
The commission has the authority to issue rules that would automatically become law. The guidelines it adopted for people convicted of crimes have come under strong criticism by judges who say they are left with little discretion in sentencing. These judges also assert that the new guidelines have the effect of increasing the authority of prosecutors who know that the charges they use for indictment or plea-bargaining will dictate precise sentences.
On Thursday, a Federal District Judge in San Diego, J. Lawrence Irving, announced that he was resigning because he said he believed the sentencing guidelines for individuals were too harsh. ''If I remain on the bench I have no choice but to follow the law,'' he said as he announced his resignation.
In recent years, the agency has been tugged by representatives of big business who prefer the present system of case-by-case adjudication, by law theorists from the Chicago school of thought who link all legal principles to economic considerations, and by tough prosecutors who want severe sentences that some lawyers say are overly harsh.
Those tensions burst into the headlines in April, when the White House intervened and questioned the Justice Department's support for stringent sentencing standards. After the intervention, the Justice Department abruptly retracted its support.
The commission also suffered a loss of the majority of its seven members and has only recently regained a new full membership.
Some groups, notably the National Association of Manufacturers, have said that there is no need for the guidelines because there is both uniformity and no real problem in the existing structure, in which each crime carries its own prescribed range of penalties. But the commission appears to have rejected this view, and seems intent on moving forward. ''There has been consensus on the working principles as a basis for starting to draft guidelines,'' said Illene H. Nagel, a commissioner. Under the proposed framework, a prosecutor could ask for either the greater sum of gain or loss caused by the corporation's crime. The commission is also contemplating a multiplier of this amount, between two and four, so that the crime is more than just the cost of doing business.
The commission recognizes that some crimes may be severe even though there is little money gained or lost, and that some crimes are just too difficult to measure in monetary terms. How does a judge measure the fine for a corporation that pollutes a river or causes injury to birds? In those instances, the commission would permit a prosecutor to rely upon a table, which is in the midst of being devised, measuring crimes and fines.
Debate over the proposals has shifted largely to the question of mitigation as the commission considers the circumstances under which a sentence should be reduced. Ms. Nagel said the commission believed the strongest argument for mitigation would come from a corporation that cooperated with authorities and admitted its wrongdoing long before it was even under investigation.
More debatable is the treatment of a company whose senior executives assert that they have not participated in the crime. Under one provision, a judge would be permitted to reduce a sentence if the company can show that the crime was committed by a ''rogue employee'' rather than at the direction or at least with the tacit approval of the management. The theory is that the managers and owners should not be forced to pay the price for the isolated acts of a junior-level employee.
But some legal and business scholars contend that the modern decentralized corporation fosters the ability of senior executives to assert authority while avoiding responsibility for their choices. By executing budgetary decisions at the top level, and operational decisions at the lower ranks, the corporate structure encourages what scholars refer to as ''plausible deniability'' among top management for the decisions of others.

HEADLINE: World Agencies Plan Aid to Soviets and China

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Sept. 30

 BODY:
Even before the Soviet Union officially comes aboard, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are preparing technical assistance and training for the huge job of transforming the Soviet economy from a centrally planned one to a market system.
The giant lending organizations are also sliding toward a normal relationship with China. China has been a member of the organizations for 10 years, but after repressing the student-led democracy movement in Beijing last year it was hit by sanctions that included a halt to international loans.
 
Integrating the System
The moves, signaled at the joint annual meeting of the institutions last week, would help integrate the two largest countries into the world economic system and further establish the 45-year-old organizations at the center of the system's management. 
''In the long term, it's certainly desirable to reach out to all countries that matter,'' said Prof. Richard J. Herring, the director of the International Banking Center at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania.
''In the medium term, I think the prospect of technical and financial assistance is something that will be welcome and very useful for restructuring both economies,'' he said.
Officials of the lending organizations said that Moscow would soon get technical advisers to help with its financial, monetary, agricultural and industrial readjustment and that Beijing would shortly receive hundreds of millions of dollars in new loans linked to specific economic reforms. $350 Billion in Resources The institutions, with combined resources of about $350 billion, offer money and technical advice to 155 member governments.
The International Monetary Fund helps countries deal with short-term imbalances in their foreign accounts. The World Bank makes longer-term loans to strengthen broad economic sectors by building dams, fertilizer plants, irrigation works, ports, highways and other such projects.
''We believe that the Soviets are very interested in doing a lot of restructuring and doing it fairly quickly, and we are happy to advise them of that because that's our business,'' said Barber B. Conable Jr., the president of the World Bank.
He spoke after seeing a Soviet delegation to last week's meeting, led by Viktor Gerashchenko, the chairman of the State Bank of the Soviet Union, or Gosbank. It was the first time the Soviets have ever been invited to one of the joint annual meetings.
 
Changing History
Asked whether the Soviet Union would join the fund, Michel Camdessus, its managing director, mused: ''Who would have believed a year ago that we would have a unified Germany and Soviet invitees? History is moving very rapidly.''
Yet before membership, Mr. Camdessus said the bank could help the Soviets, for example, with assistance in creating a central bank.
He noted a precedent for helping countries that were not yet members, citing the fund's technical assistance last year to Namibia, which officially joined last week, along with Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia.
On China, the World Bank intends to step up its loans after lending virtually ground to a halt for more than a year. Before the massacre at Tiananmen Square in June 1989, China had been receiving World Bank loans of more than $2 billion a year.
 
Two Big Loans Planned
Since June 1989, the total has fallen to $650 million. Among the coming loans are one for $110 million intended to help small cooperative business enterprises in towns and villages and a second, for $275 million, for rural credits. The bank is also preparing loans supporting environmental protection.
Largely at the insistence of the United States, which is the dominant shareholder in both organizations, the World Bank initially blocked all loans in the sanctions after the Tiananmen Square incident.
Then in a modest softening of its position late last year, it required that credits go only to meet a narrow test of ''basic human needs.''
Now loans to China are justified under a much broader rationale -the backing of economic reforms.
The American position reflected anger on Capitol Hill, where many lawmakers, until about three months ago, were still hostile to Beijing.
 
Shifting Sentiment
Now, in light of the Chinese support for the American position in the Persian Gulf, combined with some relaxation of political conditions in China, few lawmakers are talking about challenging the Bush Adminstration or punishing China.
The new relations with Moscow reflects not only Soviet support for Washington's actions in the Middle East but also the enthusiasm of President Bush and other Western leaders for the reform efforts of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
Leaders of the seven leading industrialized nations at their meeting in Houston in July ordered the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, together with two other multinational organizations, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to report by the end of the year on Soviet problems and needs and how Western assistance might be useful.
The fund was named the lead organization for the study. Mr. Camdessus spent much of July in Moscow, making a personal assessment of the economic conditions there.
One of the basic problems, he said last week, is the critical need to make Soviet statistics more reliable.
''When the country has not exactly the set of statistical elements for calculating aggregates that we use in this part of the world, you have to start to reconcile the data,'' Mr. Camdessus noted. ''This can take some time, but members of the staff are familiar with such difficulties and they can be sorted out.''
 
Critical Assessments
As it does with all its members under its multilateral surveillance operation, the fund is already starting to make candid, critical assessments of the economic performance of the Soviet Union.
In a document published last week, the fund's staff wrote that Soviet output would decline this year, reflecting a breakdown in labor discipline and ethnic and regional conflicts.
It said a policy shift late last year to place greater emphasis on the production of consumer goods was largely ineffective.
Then reflecting on the criticism it often makes of many developing countries, the fund added, ''Sizable increases in wages and the large fiscal deficit contributed importantly to the continuation of market imbalances.''

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL REPORT;
Japan's Ambiguous Economic News

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Sept. 30

 BODY:
The latest economic news seems completely incongruous: the financial markets are reeling as stock prices continue their vicious yearlong plunge and interest rates soar to their highest levels in nearly a decade. In the meantime, the economy is so vigorous the policy makers' biggest worry is how to rein it in.
Japanese business leaders and bureaucrats have long harbored a deep mistrust of the financial markets as a home for unproductive speculators or, worse, politicians. But rarely has that attitude been more clearly manifested than during the current malaise in the markets, a divergence from the apparently robust health of what is almost always referred to here as the ''real economy.'' 
Some maintain that the current turmoil is demonstrating a fundamental difference in how Japan and the United States responded to the raging bull markets of the 1980's. Through leveraged buyouts and other corporate changes, much of the vast wealth created on Wall Street was siphoned off by investors, to be replaced by debt; in Japan the wealth tended to remain in the hands of conservative corporations, available to finance future expansion and sustain them when markets soured.
 
Corporate Strength
How much that matters is now apparent. Different sectors of the economy here are being affected differently by the plunge; indeed, many say that the dive is a reflection of growing uncertainty about the prospects in such areas as the real estate market. But major corporations are generally in their strongest position in years and appear able to ride out many months of declines.
Japan's markets have actually performed worse than Wall Street this year. After tumbling sharply last week, the Nikkei stock index is down a troubling 46 percent from its peak at the end of last year - and stands at its lowest point since March 1987.
The official discount rate has more than doubled in the last 16 months, to 6 percent, and the long-term prime rate at banks has leaped almost 1.5 percentage points in two months, to nearly 9 percent.
Bank profits are expected to fall by a third, and securities firms' earnings could plunge by more than 50 percent. Credit is getting scarcer, and higher oil prices are bolstering inflation.
 
Rapid Economic Growth
The economy? It grew at a torrid 7.4 percent rate during the first half of the year, its fastest pace since the first oil shock in 1973 and quite a contrast to the barely perceptible expansion in the United States. Industrial production, retail sales and corporate investment are blazing ahead, partly because big companies avoided being loaded with debt.
Economists maintain that a sustained plunge in the markets will eventually take a toll on the economy by choking off access to capital and breaking consumer confidence. Inflation, a byproduct of an overheated economy, is a continuing fear, too. And some worry that a sharp decline in property prices might stall consumer spending. But many also argue that corporations, while not immune to these uncertainties, will have more breathing time to adjust to the tougher conditions.
''Money will get even tighter, and that will hurt the markets even more,'' said Akio Mikuni, president of his own credit rating company. ''But demand in the economy will remain strong for some time, at least until next year because of the position of corporations.''
According to a recent stock exchange survey, Japanese corporations have on average $30 of capital for every $100 worth of assets as of six months ago, an extraordinarily strong figure that frees companies from having to pay punishingly high interest rates or raise capital by selling new shares at depressed levels.
 
Inflation a Threat
That has helped them sustain a massive investment spree to modernize, automate and expand. Such business spending is at the highest level of any industrialized country and nearly double the level in the United States.
''Japan responds to the same economic signals that everyone else does,'' said Robert Alan Feldman, an economist with Salomon Brothers Asia. ''But corporations here spent the past few years getting themselves ready for these conditions.''
Richard Koo, an economist at the Nomura Research Institute, said the growing labor shortage was also helping maintain strong consumer spending. With the supply of skilled workers running 15 percent short of the demand, Japanese employees can count on regular wage increases, Mr. Koo said, and that leads to more confident spending. If anything, it makes inflation more of a threat than recession.

World's Markets Post Hefty Losses in Quarter

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
Battered by higher oil prices and a weakening global economy, the world's major stock markets finished their worst quarter since 1974 on Friday.
In countries that rely heavily on imported oil, including Japan, France, West Germany and Italy, the markets have lost more than a quarter of their value since June 30 as investors have dumped stocks in favor of short-term investments like government notes and bank deposits. Even in countries with large domestic oil industries, including the United States and Britain, the markets have lost more than a seventh of their value.
All 24 national markets tracked by the Financial Times-Actuaries world indexes fell in local currency terms in the third quarter and were down an average of 23.07 percent. 
A weakening dollar insulated American investors only slightly, with world markets falling 19.07 percent in dollar terms. Stocks in the United States fell 14.74 percent.
 
Analysts Are Pessimistic
Rising energy prices and stagnating economic activity have many analysts saying they are pessimistic about the next few months and reluctant to recommend stock purchases. ''What we're saying now to investors is not to try to catch a falling knife,'' said Jeffrey M. Weingarten, the director of international equity research in the London office of Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The relatively small markets in Norway and Mexico, both oil exporters, lost less than 2 percent of their value. Losses in the Australian, Canadian and South African markets were limited, in part because mining companies benefited from higher gold prices.
The Japanese market sank 33.18 percent, measured by the yen and 26.42 percent in dollars. Robert A. Brusca, senior vice president and chief economist of Nikko Securities International Inc., said the drop reflected not only alarm about the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2 but also ''the dissipation of a speculative bubble'' and ''less hand holding by the Government to support the market.''
For example, he said, Japanese monetary authorities have kept interest rates high to fight inflation, although this policy has hurt stocks.
 
French Stock Market Off 26.40%
The French stock market fell 26.40 percent, measured in francs, and 21.45 percent in dollars. Ricaldo Zavala, the president of the international department at Magnin-Cordelle S.A., a Paris brokerage, attributed the drop to poor corporate earnings for the first half of this year and concern that France's heavy dependence on imported oil would mean high trade deficits this autumn. The risk of such trade deficits is forcing French monetary authorities to keep interest rates high to prevent the franc from tumbling.
Sentiment in the Paris Bourse is very pessimistic, Mr. Zavala said, adding, ''People get burned and burned again, and you find it quite difficult to find any buying interest.''
The West German market tumbled 28.64 percent, measured in marks, and 24.11 percent in dollars. The unification of Germany is likely to cost more than most experts initially predicted and is likely to claim funds that might otherwise have been invested in the Frankfurt market, said Jonathan M. Hoffman, the senior European economist at Credit Suisse First Boston Ltd. in London.
 
Austria Posts the Worst Results
Austria posted the worst results of the 24 countries in the Financial Times-Actuaries world indexes, with a 34.02 percent loss in Austrian schillings and a 29.87 percent loss in dollars. The market fell on concerns that rebuilding Eastern Europe would drain investment funds and that stocks had become overvalued after spectacular gains last year and early this year, said Johannes Linhart, a senior stock sales officer at UBS Phillips & Drew, a London securities firm.
Sheltered from events in the Middle East by large-scale oil production in the North Sea, the British market outperformed the world average, falling 17.42 percent, measured in pounds, and 11.31 percent in dollars. Weak corporate earnings and the waning likelihood of Britain's soon entering the European Community's exchange rate system pushed down stocks in London, said Michael J. Howell, the director of European investment strategy at Salomon Brothers Inc.
Norway dipped 1.91 percent, measured in kroner, and gained 3.55 percent in dollars, as the share prices of two large oil companies, Norsk Hydro and Saga, posted large increases. The two companies together account for about two-fifths of the value of the Norwegian market, and their gains balanced heavy losses in the shipping sector, said Simon D. Scholes, a Scandinavian stock analyst at Hoare Govett Ltd., a London securities firm.
 
Shipping Stocks Decline
Shipping stocks generally did badly in the quarter, depressed by concerns about higher fuel costs and smaller shipments of oil and other goods as the United Nations embargo against Iraq and Kuwait continues and as the world economy slows. Shares in the A. P. Moeller group, a large shipping and offshore oil company that makes up about a fifth of the Danish stock market's value, fell during the quarter. That dragged the Danish market to a 14.08 percent loss in the local currency, the krone, and a 8.87 percent loss in dollars.
Hurt by stagnant prices and rising costs in the world's forestry industry, the Swedish and Finnish markets fell by 32.84 percent and 26.84 percent respectively, measured in local currencies, and by 29.69 percent and 23.06 percent in dollar terms. Swedish capital goods companies like SKF A.B., the ball bearing maker, also tumbled on shrinking demand for their products.
Australia fell 8.26 percent in local currency terms and 4.40 percent in dollars, while South Africa fell 10.18 percent in local currency terms and 6.01 percent in dollars. Canada fell 8.07 percent in Canadian dollars and 7.28 percent in United States dollars.
Oil-importing Spain and Singapore fell 28 percent and 29.72 percent respectively in local currency terms and 24.8 percent and 26.71 percent respectively in dollars. Stocks in Mexico, which has increased oil exports during the Persian Gulf crisis, fell 1.63 percent in pesos and dropped 2.94 percent in dollars.
Switzerland dropped 25.81 percent in local currency terms and 19.13 percent in dollars, as the strengthening Swiss franc hurt exporters.

Insurance Stocks: Confidence Dims

BYLINE: By Anise C. Wallace

 BODY:
ALTHOUGH prices of some insurance stocks rebounded on Friday, investors' faith in the insurance industry has been as weak as it has been in the banking system in recent weeks.
Many investors have sold insurance stocks because they are concerned that inadequate reserves and poor investments in real estate, mortgages and other financial assets could lead to failures. Like banks and savings and loans, insurers are financial intermediarires that shift the assets of savers to borrowers. Consequently investors who are now concerned about the health of the financial system are selling the stocks of almost all financial companies whose assets are falling in value. 
''Anything that's financial is being killed,'' said Michael Frinquelli, a managing director at Salomon Brothers who follows the insurance industry. In fact, the decline in the Nasdaq insurance index last week was the worst weekly drop since the week the stock market crashed in October 1987.
''Investors don't trust anything that they're being told,'' said Myron M. Picoult, a senior vice president at Oppenheimer & Company, who follows the insurance industry.
Some industry observers worry that some insurers that have large real estate holdings and investments in commercial mortgages might fail. ''I don't expect the industry will go bankrupt, but some companies may,'' Mr. Picoult said.
In their eagerness to shed stocks of insurance companies from their portfolios last week, investors sold some issues almost without regard to the price, traders said. ''There is clearly a concern about asset quality,'' Mr. Picoult added. ''But there has been no effort to differentiate among companies.''
Since the beginning of the year, an index of multiservice insurance companies compiled by the Standard & Poor's Corporation has dropped about 30 percent; the S.& P. index of life insurance companies is down more than 27 percent, and the S.& P. index of property and casualty companies is down about 22 percent.
Stocks of several insurance companies are down by much greater levels. For instance, on Friday Ambase closed at $1.75 a share, down 89 percent from its 52-week high of $16.125. Aetna closed at $38 a share, down 33 percent from $57 at the beginning of the year. American International Group has dropped 29.8 percent from its high of $89.50 a share, to $62.75. Travelers has fallen 49 percent, to $21.50 a share, from its high of $42.375.
Investors in life insurance companies are primarily worried about the quality of the assets the insurers are holding. Investors in property and casualty companies are worried about the direction of interest rates, the poor outlook for the companies' earnings and the questionable adequacy of their reserves. And holders of stock in multiservice insurers are fearful about the combination of problems with assets and reserves.
While Mr. Picoult and others said they believed that the recent liquidation of these stocks may be slightly irrational, he argued that some property and casualty companies may be in trouble because they do not have adequate reserves against existing or future claims. In 1987, reserves were deficient by 7 to 11 percent and, in 1988, they were off by 9 to 13 percent, he said.
''They've got to put the money up at some point,'' he said. ''They can get it from operations or from liquidating their portfolios.'' In this weak market, though, selling financial assets like real estate, stocks or bonds would be difficult.
Representatives of the life insurance industry maintain that the fears about their investments are unnecessary. The more than 2,000 life insurance companies in this country have about $44 billion - or only 3.2 percent of their $1.37 trillion in assets - invested in real estate, said a spokesman for the American Council of Life Insurance, a trade group based in Washington. Another $265 billion, or 19.2 percent, is invested in mortgages.
The group's quarterly survey of rates for delinquency - payments that are 90 days late - does not indicate a sharp rise, he said. In fact, at the end of June, the delinquent loans as a percentage of all mortgages dropped slightly, to 3.03 percent, from 3.07 percent at the end of March. The rate is indeed off from the high of 3.84 percent set in December 1986, but it is up sharply from the end of 1980, when it stood at only 1.03 percent.
Whether or not the portfolios of investments held by life insurers are in trouble depends on individual companies. Some companies like First Executive, whose stock is down 92 percent this year, to 75 cents a share, have large investments in ''junk bonds'' while others do not.
Despite Friday's improvement in stock prices, Mr. Frinquelli of Salomon said he believed that the stocks of property and casualty companies are not likely to recover over the next few months or years. Premiums have been climbing at a slower pace than loss claims, and these companies' earnings are sensitive to any increase in interest rates. ''It's too early to buy these stocks now,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Dinkins's Moves: Costly Plan of Action

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
On disparate fronts, Mayor David N. Dinkins has taken actions that may commit New York City to a costly round of wage settlements and will commit it to raising $649 million in new taxes and charges to hire thousands of police officers and expand other anticrime programs.
Faced with several hard choices at once, Mr. Dinkins sought yesterday to give something to everyone, preparing to announce today a mix of tax proposals to fight crime, including a 25-cent surcharge on lottery tickets and about $200 million in higher property taxes. At the same time, he strove to reward a union that helped elect him last year.
But in doing so, even some fiscal experts who have generally supported the Mayor said he has taken on an unruly range of new burdens that could risk hamstringing his mayoralty or undermining the city's increasingly difficult fiscal situation. 
Asked at a news conference announcing the one-year, 5.5 percent wage settlement for teachers if he was worried about the effect of the pay increases and the new police hiring on the city's fiscal condition, the city's Budget Director, Philip R. Michael, said, ''Terribly.''
The settlement is below the current rate of inflation. But it and the proposed tax increases would come on top of more than $800 million in higher taxes passed in June to balance the current budget. And it would come in the face of an expected budget gap of more than $1 billion for the fiscal year that starts July 1 and will undoubtedly require even more tax increases.
''I think it means that there is an administrative crisis in New York City government, and the question is whether it can be stopped before it becomes a fiscal crisis,'' said Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group financed by businesses. ''I think it's like a billiard ball. It gets up in the morning, sits there on the table and other people put it in motion. It's not moving anything; it's reacting.''
Felix G. Rohatyn, the chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation and one of the architects of the city's recovery from the fiscal crisis of the mid-70's, said the administration appeared to have no coherent overall plan to address its fiscal challenges.
''All these things seem to be hanging off a Calder mobile in the air, with their own motion and their own life, and they don't relate to the past or the future,'' Mr. Rohatyn said. He added: ''There's no discussion at all about how to deal with the long-term problem. It's something that I keep looking for and it's just not there.''
 
'Why Couldn't They Wait?'
The Mayor's spokesman, Albert Scardino, said last night that such comments were ''intemperate and unfortunate, particularly since they were uttered on the eve of the Mayor's proposals for addressing our criminal-justice problems.
''Why couldn't they wait 24 hours to see the entire package before making judgments about the value of the effort?'' he asked.
The teachers' raise would cost the city $62 million in direct payments: the 1.5 percent increase it had included in its budget. But the real cost could be considerably higher, with another $70 million in state aid and other money coming from the Board of Education.
The city would also agree to use $104 million gained by recalculating earnings estimates for the teachers' pension fund to supplement the raises.
Essentially, the pension fund would diversify its investments, assuming a higher rate of return. The city could then reduce its annual contribution to the fund, and use the difference for the raises.
Mr. Rohatyn criticized the pension device, saying any pension savings should be considered for general city needs, like hiring police officers or closing the budget gap.
 
Following Teachers' Lead
Last summer, Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman suggested that the city could use such savings for general budget balancing needs, but the idea was promptly dismissed by other city officials, who acknowledged they were saving it for labor settlements.
But the maneuver requires approval by both the union and city representatives on the pension board, and city officials said the union would be reluctant to make the change if it did not gain the benefit.
More problematically for the city, leaders of other unions said they now considered the teachers' settlement the pattern for their bargaining, though not all union pension funds could produce so much extra money. The city had let it be known that it was willing to provide slightly higher raises for teachers than for the thousands of other workers whose contracts are also expiring, but it had hoped to settle with the teachers last.
To finance the anticrime plan, the Mayor will propose today raising about $200 million in higher property taxes, $120 million through a surcharge on state lottery tickets sold in the city -earmarked to guard students and deter them from crime - and a payroll tax on all wage earners in the city and their employers that would raise more than $300 million, senior officials said. In practice, employers might factor their share of the payroll tax into wage settlements.
The $649 million includes debt service on the cost of issuing bonds to build new jail cells, but does not take into account the total costs of such capital building projects. The city has suggested it will have to trim its captial spending by an amount in the range of 25 percent because of the burden of paying debt service on the annual operating budget.
The bulk of the proposed new taxes would require approval by the State Legislature, though the Council has power to approve the property-tax increase. If enacted, most increases would not take effect until this summer, mayoral aides said. But Mr. Dinkins would propose raising $100 million in property taxes starting in January, rising to $200 million in the next fiscal year.
 
Difficulty Predicted in Albany
That would mean an increase of about $40 for the typical homeowner, Council aides estimated, on top of an annual increase of about $48 already imposed when the budget was adopted in June.
For a single New Yorker earning $50,000 a year, the payroll tax would eventually cost about $75 a year, on top of a personal income tax surcharge adopted in June that will cost a similar taxpayer about $1,300. None of that counts various state tax increases passed last spring.
Given the state's own fiscal difficulties, and the likelihood that it, too, will have to propose still higher taxes next year, mayoral aides acknowledged that they would face a difficult job persuading the Legislature to support the package. Aides said they planned to press the matter in a special session scheduled for December.
Mr. Dinkins had often suggested that the lottery surcharge - first suggested by the Council last month - might require a state constitutional amendment, because lottery proceeds are earmarked for education.
But in proposing to use the surcharge to hire more school security guards and mount school anticrime programs, the Mayor appeared to be trying to avoid that risk, and at the same time hand the Council an olive branch that might encourage it to pass higher property taxes, something it usually resists.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
BUSH, AT U.N., SEES HOPE IN DIPLOMACY IN THE GULF CRISIS

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Stepping back from the tough tone of recent days, President Bush told the constellation of world leaders gathered here today that he was hopeful that there may be a diplomatic solution to the Persian Gulf confrontation.
Addressing the opening session of the General Assembly, where Iraqi delegates sat listening near Kuwaiti delegates in the alphabetically ordered chamber, Mr. Bush continued to insist that ''the annexation of Kuwait will not be permitted to stand.'' He referred to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq as ''the dictator.''
''Iraq's unprovoked aggression is a throwback to another era, a dark relic from a dark time,'' he said in the General Assembly Hall. ''It has plundered Kuwait, terrorized innocent civilians, and held even diplomats hostage. Iraq and its leaders must be held liable for these crimes of abuse and destruction.'' [Transcript, page A12.] A Carrot of Conciliation But he told reporters later that he was not pressing for the idea -raised on Friday by his national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft - of another Security Council resolution that might include an explicit mention of military force. And in his speech, which was received with respectful applause, the President offered a carrot of conciliation to Iraq. 
''In the aftermath of Iraq's unconditional departure from Kuwait, I truly believe there may be opportunities,'' he said, ''for Iraq and Kuwait to settle their differences permanently, for the states of the gulf themselves to build new arrangements for stability, and for all the states and peoples of the region to settle the conflict that divides the Arabs from Israel.''
 
An Implicit Link
At the recent meeting in Helsinki with the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Mr. Bush brushed off a question about Mr. Hussein's attempt to link the invasion of Kuwait with the dispute over Israel's occupation of land that Syria and Jordan lost in the 1967 Middle East war. He said the solution of the debate over a homeland for Palestinians was a matter ''separate and apart'' from the Kuwaiti invasion.
But today, in what appeared to be a gesture to Mr. Hussein, the President implicitly linked the disputes by mentioning them in the same sentence of his speech. It could not be determined whether Mr. Bush's new emphasis on a diplomatic solution and his mention of the Arab-Israeli conflict was intended to provide the Iraqi leader with a face-saving opportunity, or, indeed, whether Washington had any reason to believe that Mr. Hussein was seeking such an opportunity. A senior Administration official said that all the President was trying to do today was ''to remind people that the diplomatic option is still our preferred option.''
At the same time the official said the Administration was not abandoning its policy of keeping the gulf conflict and the Arab-Israeli conflict separate. The official said the Administration was simply trying to signal to the Arab world some of the diplomatic opportunities that would exist after an unconditional Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.
Administration officials said the President's speech was written before Mr. Scowcroft unveiled the idea of a new, tougher United Nations resolution on Friday.
From the beginning of the conflict, Mr. Bush has blended the diplomatic glove with the military fist, seeming sometimes to favor one approach and then the other.
President Francois Mitterrand of France made a similar link in a peace proposal he offered last week at the United Nations that was designed to appeal to the Iraqi President.
Mr. Mitterrand suggested that an Iraqi promise to withdraw from Kuwait would be sufficient to start negotiations, which could also deal with the division of Lebanon and the Arab-Israeli conflict.
On Sunday, Mr. Hussein responded by saying that he would talk to France but that he would not withdraw his forces from Kuwait. He reiterated that before negotiations could begin, all Western forces would have to withdraw from the Persian Gulf and an independent Palestinian state would have to be established.
Speaking to reporters after his speech today, Mr. Bush said he might have offered a shift in emphasis but denied that it showed any ''flexibility'' in his attitude toward Mr. Hussein.
 
Optimism for an Iraqi '180'
He said his whirlwind round of meetings this weekend with other leaders had given him ''a little optimism'' that Mr. Hussein might ''do a 180 and get out,'' referring to a 180-degree turn.
He said the rare united stance of nations against Iraq, combined with the economic sanctions, might persuade the mercurial Iraqi President to suddenly change his mind and let Kuwait go, just as he abruptly caved in to Iran by conceding much of what the two nations had fought over for eight years.
Mr. Bush said he had heard from other leaders here ''rather optimistic words on two points.''
''One, that Saddam Hussein is beginning to understand that it is him against the world - he against the world,'' he said. ''And secondly, more optimism in various quarters that the sanctions are really beginning to bite hard.''
 
Thatcher's Comments Raised
Asked about the comment today by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain that Article 51 of the United Nations Charter gives the allies sufficient authority for military action, Mr. Bush said he agreed. But he added that the United States had been careful to seek more specific authorization for halting and boarding ships.
''You may remember,'' he said, ''that we waited until we got a resolution before interdicting ships that more directly confirmed the right to do that.''
In his speech, Mr. Bush tried to assure other leaders that the American presence in the gulf is not permanent. ''We seek no advantage for ourselves,'' he said, ''nor do we seek to maintain our military forces in Saudi Arabia for one day longer than is necessary.''
After a 35-minute meeting with Mr. Bush this afternoon, the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, echoed Mr. Bush's hopeful note.
''We and the Administration believe that there is still a chance for a peaceful settlement,'' Mr. Shevardnadze said. ''And we are ready to work together to achieve such a peaceful settlement.''
 
House Backs Gulf Policy
WASHINGTON, Oct. 1 (Special to The New York Times) - The House overwhelmingly approved a joint resolution today that supports President Bush's current policy in the Persian Gulf, but stops short of endorsing future military action against Iraq.
Despite concern expressed by a number of lawmakers about the possibility that the United States might engage in a full-scale war with Iraq, the resolution passed by a 380-to-29 vote.
Today was the first time since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2 that the House or the Senate had put the weight of Congress behind the American deployment in the gulf.
The measure, which is nonbinding, now goes to the Senate for its consideration, where a similar resolution is pending. It also withholds open-ended authority for the President to use military force in the gulf. A Senate vote is expected on Tuesday.
Mr. Bush has not asked Congress to approve military action, nor would he necessarily do so if he decides to sent United States troops into combat in response to Iraqi action.
Some lawmakers wanted to send a signal to the White House that they are not necessarily prepared to see the United States go to war in the gulf.

HEADLINE: NEW YORK AGREES TO RAISE OF 5.5% FOR CITY TEACHERS

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
The Dinkins administration and New York's teachers' union announced tentative agreement yesterday on a $236 million one-year contract that provides raises of 5.5 percent.
The agreement drew instant praise from labor leaders around the city and nearly universal alarm from fiscal watchdogs, who viewed the settlement as a worrisome precedent. The city has 132 other contracts yet to negotiate.
The agreement comes amid a steadily worsening scenario of municipal finance: eroding revenues, new taxes, service cuts, growing budget-gap projections and costly police expansion plans. All this comes against the backdrop of a slumping regional economy and rising inflation. 
 
Economic Uncertainties
Even as he praised the contract agreement, the first of his administration, Mayor David N. Dinkins noted that the shift from the traditional two- and three-year pacts to a one-year contract reflected economic uncertainties and that the city ''did not want to be bound to a contract'' that it might not be able to fulfill.
The city budget provides for a 1.5 percent raise. An additional 2.5 percent would come from revising the earnings calculations in the teachers' pension fund, thus reducing the city's payment to the fund, with the resulting savings being used for the raise. The final 1.5 percent is to come from state education aid.
City officials estimated the total cost of the wage increase at $228 million. In addition to the raise, the settlement provides a $100 city contribution for each employee to the union's health and welfare benefit fund to meet higher medical insurance costs. That item's cost was estimated at $8 million, to be financed from state education aid.
School officials said the $70 million in state aid being used for the raise and health insurance fund was the previously unallocated portion of a $153 million state appropriation to help the city schools cover a variety of inflationary cost increases.
Under the proposal, the starting pay for a new teacher without postgraduate credits would rise from $25,000 a year to $26,375, while the top step for a teacher with a master's degree plus 30 credits and 20 years of experience would rise from $50,000 to $52,750. Even with the new scale, city pay lags behind the salaries at many competing suburban school districts.
The teachers' union president, Sandra Feldman, who was one of the first to endorse Mr. Dinkins when he ran for mayor, predicted that her union's members would ratify the new contract in balloting over the next two weeks. About 2,700 union delegates voted overwhelmingly last night to recommend approval.
 
'It's Terrific'
Fellow unionists cheered the news.
''I think it's terrific - that now becomes my number,'' said Barry Feinstein, president of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents 12,000 city workers. Stanley W. Hill, executive director of the 140,000-member District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, called the teachers' settlement ''a good contract.'' So did James J. Boyle, president of the 9,000-member Uniformed Firefighters Association.
But the city's Labor Relations Commissioner, Eric J. Schmertz, cautioned that the teachers' raise did not necessarily set the standard for other unions. ''I'm not prepared to say it represents a pattern; it's not binding on anyone else,'' he said. In particular, he said the teachers benefited from pension fund savings and state education aid that may not be available to other unions.
But it seems clear that the other municipal workers' unions will argue to get at least what the teachers got. Henry J. Stern, president of the Citizens Union, a nonprofit organization, said, ''After this, who can ask for anything less?''
The city budget includes a 1.5 percent increase for labor contracts this fiscal year. But because of the variety of fund sources for each negotiation, it was not clear how an average 5.5 percent increase across the board would affect New York's finances.
The agreement came late yesterday morning, several hours after the midnight expiration of the old contract, as United Federation of Teachers officers prepared to seek strike authorization from their 85,000 members. The formal announcement was made at City Hall.
 
Direct Role for Mayor
Mayor Dinkins praised the settlement, in which he took a direct role, intervening in negotiations late Sunday and early yesterday morning at his official residence, Gracie Mansion. He said the new contact, averting a possible strike, held the pay increase within the inflation rate and limited the direct cost to the city budget.
''This is a triumph of collective bargaining,'' the Mayor told a City Hall news conference. ''This contract represents an important achievement for the teachers, the school system and the people of the city. I think in most quarters the reaction will be that the city has done well.''
Approvals needed to enact the contract include votes by the pension fund trustees and the State Legislature on the new pension financing. Until those approvals are given, the contract should be considered a contingent agreement, said Allen J. Proctor, director of the State Financial Control Board. ''As of now, the city does not yet have in hand the money to pay for this settlement,'' he said.
Citing the pension fund's recent earnings record, State Comptroller Edward V. Regan said he was dubious about the plan to raise the assumed yield rate. But City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman said recent diversification of the pension fund's investments justified the change.
 
A Costly Precedent
As for the raise itself, Mr. Regan said, ''This settlement is likely to set a precedent the city cannot afford.'' Several others echoed his view.
Felix G. Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, a state agency, called the amount of the raise ''troublesome.'' He said the raise ''is certainly not going to be helpful'' to the city's finances and might lead to a review of its credit rating.
 
Highlights of the Teachers Pact
 
Teachers will receive a one-year pay increase of 5.5 percent and a contribution of $100 per member to the welfare fund. The total of $236 million would come from these sources:
 
Hearings for teachers charged with policy or rule violations will be quicker. Decisions, under binding arbitration, will be made by a single arbitrator, and there will be no appeal.
 
A school-based management program is incorporated into the contract as official policy.
 
School prinicipals must respect teachers' judgment on student grades and may not change them without justification.
 
Teachers may determine the format of their own lesson plans; the principal may no longer dictate lesson plan forms.
 
A new provision allows teachers to work parttime at prorated salaries.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET AGREEMENT: Selling the Deal;
White House and Top Democrats Take Budget Accord to Congress

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Using the heaviest weapons in their arsenal, the White House and Congressional Democrats joined forces today to overcome spirited opposition from the rank and file to the sweeping five-year budget deal struck over the weekend.
President Bush sent his top lieutenants, including Vice President Dan Quayle, to the Capitol to quell a rebellion among conservative Republican lawmakers by appealing to their party loyalty. Democratic leaders in the Senate and House called their troops into separate meetings to try to sell the plan to wary liberals.
 
Senate Likely, House Uncertain
At this stage, the Senate is expected to approve the package, which is supposed to reduce the deficit by $40 billion in the fiscal year that began today and by $500 billion over five years. But the outlook in the House of Representatives is uncertain and seems to depend largely on whether Mr. Bush can use personal appeals to persuade a majority of Republicans in the House to support him. 
Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, the House Republican leader, suggested that the plan might well be voted down in the House on the first try but would eventually be enacted.
The critical votes are not expected until the week after next. Lawmakers will probably be given the opportunity only to vote for or against the entire package, not to amend it.
Richard G. Darman, the budget director, said Mr. Bush planned to call many lawmakers personally to solicit their support.
At a news conference in New York, the President said: ''I've had to compromise. The Democrats have had to compromise. And I hope that other voices who are troubled by one aspect or another of this would also compromise. Every once in a while you come to a time when you have to do that to get something done.''
Supporters of the deficit-reduction plan hope that a tighter fiscal policy will encourage the Federal Reserve Board to lower interest rates. The Federal Reserve's policy-making group meets here Tuesday.
The main complaint of conservative Republicans is that the package would raise taxes by $134 billion over five years and would not lower the tax on capital gains, the profits from investments.
A comment from Representative Duncan Hunter of California was typical. ''The President,'' he said, ''gave away the crown jewel of his campaign promise to bring the Democrats to the table. That was 'no new taxes.' The President was extorted.''
 
Working the Hill
Five top Administration officials spent the day lobbying on Capitol Hill: Mr. Quayle; Mr. Darman; Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady; John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, and Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers.
At a luncheon meeting, they managed to mollify most Republican senators. Afterward, Senator Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire said he expected at least 30 of the 45 Republican senators to vote for the package.
But House Republicans were a different matter. ''I think we will get a majority of Republicans in the Senate, but the House is going to be more difficult,'' Mr. Darman said.
After meeting with Republican members of Congress this afternoon, Mr. Quayle said: ''I felt a little bit like a friendly dentist applying a lot of Novocain and trying to extract a few votes. We're not there yet.''
Mr. Bush and the Congressional leaders pledged to provide the votes from a majority of lawmakers of both parties in both houses. Since the package is full of unpopular measures like higher gasoline taxes, lower Medicare benefits and a reduction of payments to farmers, the idea is to keep either party from bearing too much of the political pain.
 
'Leadership Did the Best It Could'
In the House, Democratic leaders urged their troops to keep quiet while Republicans fought with the President.
Some liberals, like Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, announced their opposition. But most said they were still studying the details.
Democratic dissatisfaction is strongest over the $60 billion cut in Medicare benefits over the next five years and new excise taxes that would hit middle-income taxpayers harder than the wealthy.
But the prevailing view is that if the Republicans produce a majority of their members, Democrats will go along. ''Despite the grumbling and real concerns,'' said Representative Charles E. Schumer of Brooklyn, ''there's a quiet undertone that we have to do something and that the leadership did the best it could under very difficult circumstances.''
If most House Republicans vote against the package, most House Democrats may oppose it too.
The 16 Democratic senators who are up for re-election have been ''given a free pass,'' as one of them put it, to vote against the measure. But most of the other 39 are expected to support it.
''The key committee chairmen have a responsibility to do all they can to help the leadership,'' said Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont. He is chairman of the Agriculture Committee and is upset about cuts in payments to farmers, but he said he would vote for the plan.
Two important Democrats, Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas and Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the chairmen of the tax-writing committees, are annoyed about the package, in large part because they did not participate directly in the main tax decisions.
Mr. Bentsen is said to be upset over the size of the gasoline tax increase, a total of 12 cents a gallon over two years. Texans drive more than residents of more densely populated states and would thus be affected more than Easterners. On Sunday, the Senator insisted that the budget negotiators reopen the compromise to add a two-cent-a-gallon tax on home heating oil, which would hit the Northeast hardest.
 
The Bentsen-Rostenkowski Factor
Among other items, Mr. Rostenkowski is said to oppose a provision that would require state and local government workers to pay Social Security taxes. That is important in Illinois, where state employees have their own retirement system and are now exempt from the Federal program.
Mr. Bentsen and Mr. Rostenkowski will be largely responsible for drafting the tax plan into law. The two chairmen can cause problems if they exercise their authority to make changes in the plan.
On Sunday night, at a meeting of Democrats on the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Rostenkowski expressed his disappointment in the plan, according to a lawmaker who was there. The chairman, who controls his committee with a firm hand, reportedly said he could not personally take on the Democratic leadership, but he gave his followers a free hand to do so.
Representative William H. Gray 3d of Pennsylvania, who is in charge of mobilizing Democrats behind the plan, said that changes ''on the margins'' might be permissible but that fundamental changes would not.
Senator Jim Sasser of Tennessee, chairman of the Budget Committee, made the same point. ''This package is supposed to be non-amendable,'' he said.
 
Warding Off Amendments
If committee chairmen like Mr. Bentsen and Mr. Rostenkowski want to make changes, the understanding is that they will have to clear them with the party leaders, who in turn will have to clear them with the White House before they can be authorized.
Floor amendments by back-benchers will be nearly impossible. In the House, the measure will come up week after next under procedures that prohibit or sharply limit amendments. In the Senate, the party leaders have promised to mobilize opposition to all amendments, even those they might personally support.
Those procedures were employed successfully in 1985 and 1986 to gain enactment of the monumental Tax Reform Act of 1986.
 
Echoes of '86
There are other parallels to the tax legislation, a measure like the new budget package that had strong opposition from interest groups and was pushed jointly by a Republican President and Democratic Congressional leaders.
The tax bill was rejected the first time it reached the House floor, but heavy lobbying by President Ronald Reagan turned enough votes to win passage on the second try.
Across the Capitol and around Washington, experts examined the budget compromise carefully for the first time today. They discovered items that could mean that the reduction in the deficit would be somewhat smaller than advertised.
One was the $7.5 billion the Administration expects to spend for military operations in the Persian Gulf, which is not included in the deficit reduction calculations.
Another was the inclusion of an extra $3 billion in revenue, money that the Internal Revenue Service is supposed to collect by hiring more agents and doing more tax audits. The increased enforcement effort should indeed lead to more revenue in the years ahead, specialists said. But it will take more than a year to hire and train the new agents.
In an effort to convince the financial markets that this agreement is serious about lowering the deficit, the White House and Congressional leaders agreed to the most rigid system ever devised to control new spending or lower taxes.
For the first three years, the expenditure side of the budget would be divided into three categories: military spending, domestic spending and international spending.
Any measure that exceeded the spending ceilings set by the agreement for each category would have to be offset by a spending reduction or tax increase within 15 days. Otherwise, across-the-board spending cuts would go into place immediately in the category where the increase fit.
For instance, if a law were passed increasing spending for education by $1 billion and no spending cut or tax increase were enacted to balance it, all domestic programs would be cut by the percentage necessary to make up for the $1 billion.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET AGREEMENT: Who Will Pay;
Tax Burden Expected to Fall On People of Moderate Means

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
The substantial tax increases agreed to by Administration and Congressional negotiators over the weekend would be paid mostly by people of moderate means, despite various provisions aimed specifically at buyers of yachts and others with six-figure incomes, private specialists said today.
The proposed taxes, especially the 12-cent increase for gasoline to be phased in by next summer, also appear to cut across economic lines to favor urban over rural Americans and older taxpayers over younger ones.
It is the package's heavy weighting toward consumption taxes like the gasoline levy that causes it to hit the middle classes the hardest. There are far more of them driving cars to work every day than there are rich people buying yachts. According to Government calculations made available to The New York Times, taxpayers in the income ranges of $30,000 to $40,000 and $40,000 to $50,000 would be hit hardest, paying an average 3.3 percent more under the plan. Those in the range of $20,000 to $30,000 would pay 3 percent more while those in the ranges of $50,000 to $75,000 and $75,000 to $100,000 would see their total tax bills rise 2 percent, assuming they do not alter their spending patterns. 
Taxpayers with incomes of $100,000 to $200,000 are to pay 1.5 percent more and those with $200,000 and more are expected to pay an extra three-tenths of 1 percent, if the measures pass.
Only those on the lowest income rungs are expected to pay less. A 3.8 percent decline is forecast in overall taxes for those in the $10,000-to-$20,000 bracket and a drop of one-tenth of 1 percent for those with less than $10,000 a year. These taxpayers would benefit heavily from an increase in the earned income tax credit.
Over all, Federal collections - sales as well as income taxes - are to rise 1.6 percent, the calculations showed.
Despite the reduction for those with the lowest incomes, economists generally regarded the tax proposals as mildly regressive. This means that the burden would falls relatively more heavily on those of ordinary means -though the dollar amount of their increases may be no greater - than on the wealthy.
An extra 12 cents for a gallon of gasoline, for example, could be a serious blow to a $350-a-week clerk who drives long distances to work while the additional amount would scarcely be felt by a high-income corporate executive.
Unlike the major tax overhaul enacted in 1986, when economic theory was served by a slash in income tax rates and an expansion in the types of revenue subject to taxation, this year's negotiations were driven by a need to cut the budget deficit in some politically palatable way.
The only important assault on the principles governing the 1986 law appeared to be a limitation on itemized deductions for people with adjusted gross incomes above $100,000 a year, a move that has the effect of raising their tax bracket - either 28 percent or 33 percent - by as much as one percentage point. This is to raise $18 billion over the 1991-95 period.
 
Equal to 3 Percent
With medical expenses and investment-related interest payments exempted, such taxpayers would lose deductions equal to 3 percent of all income exceeding $100,000. The same $100,000 limit applies for single, joint and head of household returns. Disallowance under the proposal cannot exceed 80 percent of otherwise deductible itemized deductions subject to the proposal.
Other big revenue raisers, $13 billion and $11.7 billion respectively, are an increase, to $73,000, in the cap on wages and self-employment income considered in calculating the tax for Medicare hospital insurance and a requirement that state and local government workers not covered by a public employee retirement system join the Social Security program and pay its taxes.
By including the deduction limitation and raising the cap for health insurance, which hit hardest at the better-off, the negotiators seem to have roughly balanced the regressivity that attaches to the excise levies on cigarettes and alcohol, as well as gasoline.
The package ''doesn't seem to be highly regressive at all,'' said Isabel V. Sawhill, an economist at the liberally inclined Urban Institute.
 
Spending Figures Listed
According to the Congressional Budget Office, American families spent 2.7 percent of after-tax income on gasoline, 2 percent on liquor, wine and beer and 1.1 percent on tobacco. The poorest 20 percent, however, spent 6.9 percent for gasoline, 3.7 percent for alcohol and 4 percent on tobacco. The second-richest 20 percent, with incomes averaging $38,000, spent 2.9 percent for gasoline, 2.2 percent for alcohol and 1.1 percent for tobacco.
The budget office also reported earlier this year that families headed by someone under 30 spent a greater portion of their incomes on all three of these categories than did other age groups. Geographically, rural Americans spent 29 percent more of their incomes for gasoline than did those in the urban Northeast.
Norman Ture, president of the Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation and a former Treasury Department official in the Reagan Administration, said, ''My instinct tells me this is more regressive than not.'' But he added that this was a highly complex issue not amenable to quick analysis. He observed, for example, that it might be progressive to impose a luxury tax on fur coats, as the budget negotiators propose, but a thorough analysis would also consider the fact that mink ranchers or the furriers who sell the coats might lose their jobs if demand fell, a result he called clearly regressive.
Much analysis of progressivity and regressivity, moreover, assume that higher taxes will not induce people to alter their behavior significantly - indeed, the proponents of the measures are counting on people to buy nearly as much gasoline. Otherwise, revenue targets would not be reached. Some groups, however, will undoubtedly cut purchases more than others, shifting the regressivity-progressivity balance.
 
Little Realty Impact Seen
Real estate tax and marketing experts suggested today that limits on deductions for people with incomes over $100,000 would probably have little impact on the real estate market. M. Jack Duksin, a partner with the law firm of Berlack, Israels, Liberman, calculated that the total additional Federal tax bill to someone making $250,000 would be about $1,260.
''Nobody making a quarter-million dollars is going to base a big decision about buying a new condo or vacation home on a tax impact of $1,260,'' he said, adding that he had already taken several calls from clients wondering about the impact of the budget compromise on their real estate purchasing plans.
''I think it's a step in the right direction,'' Mr. Duksin said, ''because it's an attempt to redistribute wealth without seriously damaging the incentive to be a high wage-earner.''

HEADLINE: Stocks Stage Rally, Interest Rates Ease And Oil Prices Drop

 BODY:
Financial markets reacted swiftly to the last-minute Federal budget accord and President Bush's emphasis on a diplomatic solution in the Persian Gulf.
The battered American stock market rallied yesterday, soaring oil prices fell back and interest rates retreated. In Japan today, the Tokyo Stock Exchange reversed its slide, with the Nikkei stock index rising 2,676.55 or 13.24 percent, in its biggest one-day advance.
On Wall Street, stocks, which have been pounded ever since the invasion of Kuwait, chalked up their biggest gain in four months in heavy trading. The Dow Jones industrial average jumped 63.36 points, or 2.6 percent, to 2,515.84.
Crude oil, which last week was brushing up against $40 a barrel, or twice July's level, dropped $2.42, to $37.09, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That was one of the steepest one-day drops in recent weeks.
Treasury bond prices rose, with yields on the 30-year bond falling to 8.84 percent, the lowest level since August.
The news from Washington and the United Nations was also felt in trading in dollars and gold. The budget pact sent the dollar lower against leading foreign currencies, with traders saying the accord was expected to prompt the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates soon.
Prices of precious metals plunged in heavy trading, with gold down nearly $16 an ounce.

HEADLINE: 15 Leftists and 2 Soldiers Killed In Clash in Peruvian Coca Region

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Oct. 1

 BODY:
A clash in the Upper Huallaga River Valley of Peru has left 15 guerrillas of the leftist shining Path movement and 2 soldiers dead, the army reported today.
The battle occurred on Friday in the coca-producing area. It was the latest in a round of fighting that has left at least 70 people dead in the region over the last week. 
In the central Andes, Shining Path rebels killed six members of a local peasant defense unit 155 miles northeast of the central Andean city of Huancayo, the police said today.
In Lima, meanwhile, the newspaper Expreso reported today that another rebel group, the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru revolutionary movement, had offered to lay down its arms.
 
Rejection of U.S. Offer
The jungle ambush came two days after Peru's President, Alberto Fujimori, rejected $36 million in American military aid for Peru's armed forces to combat drug trafficking.
Mr. Fujimori had criticized the proposed military aid package, saying that armed action alone would not put an end to the coca trade in the Upper Huallaga region.
Hundreds of thousands of peasants grow coca in the valley. Mr. Fujimori says economic aid is needed to develop the area and wean farmers from coca.
The United States Drug Enforcement Administration already operates an air base with the Peruvian police in the Huallaga Valley.
In Lima, the Tupac Amaru leader, Victor Polay, who escaped from prison in July, offered to halt attacks if the Government accepted certain conditions, the newspaper Expreso reported.
A man identifying himself as Mr. Polay called the paper and said he had made the offer in an interview with Interior Minister Adolfo Alvarado.
An Interior Ministry spokesman had no comment on the news report.
The Tupac Amaru group, which began operations in 1984, is smaller than the Maoist-inspired Shining Path.
Nearly 20,000 people have died in the 10 years since Shining Path took up arms. The majority of the victims have been civilians.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Roundup;
Justices to Hear Suit Over Quotations

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Adding an important libel case to the docket for its new term, the Supreme Court agreed today to decide how courts should handle libel suits brought by interview subjects who allege that they were were deliberately misquoted.
The case is an appeal by Jeffrey M. Masson, a psychoanalyst whose iconoclastic view of the work of Sigmund Freud was the subject of a two-part article in The New Yorker in 1983.
Dr. Masson brought a $10 million libel suit against the magazine; the article's author, Janet Malcolm, and Alfred A. Knopf, which published the article as a book called, ''In the Freud Archives.'' Dr. Masson alleged that Ms. Malcolm had deliberately altered quotations from their 40 hours of interviews to make him appear foolish and professionally dishonest.
Two lower Federal courts in California, where Dr. Masson lives, dismissed his lawsuit without trial, on the ground that even if the quotations were inexact and the changes deliberate, the quotations as printed nonetheless conveyed an accurate sense of the substance of the interviews. 
 
One Empty Leather Chair
The case was one of 25 appeals that the Supreme Court accepted on its return from a three-month recess. As the Justices took the bench this morning to begin hearing arguments, one of the nine black leather chairs was empty, reflecting the midsummer retirement of Justice William J. Brennan Jr. The Senate is expected to vote Tuesday to confirm a successor, David H. Souter, whom the Senate Judiciary Committee endorsed by a 13-to-1 vote last week. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist began the Court session today by reading a letter the eight incumbent Justices sent to Justice Brennan, who was seated in a distinguished visitors' section of the courtroom. The letter noted Justice Brennan's ''profound influence upon American constitutional law'' and told him that ''the personal warmth which you radiate has enriched all of our lives.''
The question for the Court in the libel case is whether a suit by a public figure like Dr. Masson, alleging that he has been defamed through the use of altered quotations, can ever properly be dismissed before trial. The Supreme Court will almost certainly not rule on the merits of Dr. Masson's case. Rather, the Justices are likely to use the case to resolve some unsettled questions about the legal standards for dismissing such cases. If Dr. Masson prevails, he will be entitled to go to trial in Federal District Court in San Francisco.
The case, Masson v. The New Yorker, No. 89-1799, concerns the accuracy of eight passages from the 48,500-word book. In one passage, Dr. Masson is quoted as referring to himself as an ''intellectual gigolo,'' a phrase he denies having used.
 
'Substantive Equivalent'
In his decision last year upholding the dismissal of the suit, Judge Arthur Alarcon of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit said that ''while it may be true'' that Dr. Masson had not used these words, he did make ''numerous statements which were the substantive equivalent.''
Under the Supreme Court's libel precedents, Dr. Masson is required, as a public figure, to show not only that he was misquoted, but also that the inaccuracies were printed with ''actual malice,'' defined as deliberate or reckless falsehood. Dr. Masson is arguing that altered quotations are themselves sufficient evidence of ''actual malice'' to bar a dismissal before trial.
Beyond the high visibility of Dr. Masson's lawsuit, which has received wide public attention, the question of when a trial court can dismiss a libel suit before trial is an important issue in libel law. Libel defendants are often forced by economic necessity to settle a case, even one in which they might well prevail, rather than face the costs and uncertainties of a jury trial.
The Court acted today on some 1,300 appeals that had accumulated during the summer recess. Other actions today included the following:
 
Death Penalty
With only Justice Thurgood Marshall dissenting, the Court cleared the way for the execution of Joseph M. Giarratano, a convicted Virginia murderer who is one of the best-known death row inmates in the country.
Mr. Giarratano confessed in 1979 to two murders that he now asserts he may not have committed. He asserts that he was psychotic and delusional at the time, suffering from a mental illness of which he has since been cured. Now 33 years old, he has become a well-known jailhouse lawyer, preparing legal arguments for himself and other inmates.
A support committee, composed of some well-known political conservatives as well as liberals, has been seeking a new trial for him. But the effort has failed because of state and Federal court rules that bar the introduction of arguments that were not made in earlier stages of a case.
In the appeal the Court turned down today, Giarratano v. Procunier, No. 89-7661, he argued that the lower courts had improperly put the ''state's interest in finality'' above questions of fundamental fairness.
 
Foreign Discrimination
Accepting an appeal by the Federal Government, the Court agreed to decide whether the Federal law that bars discrimination in employment applies to actions taken outside the United States by an American corporation against an American citizen.
The case is an appeal from a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans. That court rejected a Federal civil rights suit brought by a Lebanese-born employee of the Arabian American Oil Company, for which the employee, a naturalized American citizen, had worked in Saudi Arabia.
The Civil Rights Act of 1964 does not apply ''with respect to the employment of aliens'' outside the United States. Federal courts have been divided over whether the statute also implicitly exempts coverage for American citizens employed overseas. The Fifth Circuit ruled that the act was not intended to apply overseas at all.
In its appeal, Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Arabian American Oil Company, No. 89-1838, the Government told the Justices that the appeals court's interpretation ''would leave a serious gap in the statute's prohibition against invidious employment discrimination.'' The employee, Ali Boureslan, whose separate appeal the Supreme Court also accepted today, alleged that his supervisor subjected him to ethnic, religious and racial slurs.
 
Nude Dancing
The Court accepted an appeal by the State of Indiana from a Federal appeals court ruling that its ban on non-obscene nude dancing is unconstitutional. The question is whether nude dancing is a form of expression deserving of protection under the First Amendment's free speech guarantee.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, found that nude dancing is a protected form of expression that can be regulated by a state but not banned outright. Erotic dancing is an ancient tradition, the court said.
Indiana's appeal, Barnes v. Glen Theatre, No. 90-26, was supported by the attorneys general of several other states, arguing that the public indecency statutes of 17 states would be invalidated if the Supreme Court agrees with the Seventh Circuit.
 
Jury Challenges
The Court agreed to decide whether lawyers in civil cases can use peremptory challenges to exclude potential jurors on the basis of their race. Four years ago, in Batson v. Kentucky, the Court ruled that the Constitution's equal protection guarantee barred prosecutors from using purely racial considerations to eliminate blacks from juries in criminal cases. But the Court has not addressed the question of whether the same standard applies in civil cases.
The question is a difficult one because the Court must first resolve the issue of whether private lawyers, who are not employees or agents of the government, are nonetheless ''state actors'' when they invoke court procedures for racially discriminatory purposes. The Constitution regulates only governmental action and does not apply to relationships between private individuals.
In this case, Edmonson v. Leesville Concrete Co., No. 89-7743, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit ruled that there was no state action in the exclusion of black jurors by a lawyer for a private defendant. The plaintiff in the case, Thaddeus Edmonson, a black man who sued his employer for negligence after an injury on the job, objected to the exclusion of black jurors and brought the appeal.
 
Police Chase
The Court agreed to decide whether the police must have a specific reason for suspecting wrongdoing before they can chase a person down the street.
The case, California v. Hodari D., No. 89-1632, is an appeal by the state from a ruling by a California appellate court. That court ruled that a police chase is a ''seizure'' for purposes of the Fourth Amendment, requiring some level of suspicion on the part of the police. The state court overturned the narcotics conviction of a teen-ager who threw a bag of cocaine on the sidewalk as he was being chased down the street. The court said the cocaine, which was used as evidence to obtain the conviction, was the product of an illegal seizure despite the fact that the officer has 11 feet away when the youth discarded it.
 
Victim Impact
The Court signaled its willingness to overturn a 1987 precedent that barred most testimony in murder cases about the personal characteristics of the victim. The Justices agreed to hear an appeal by the state of Ohio from a State Supreme Court decision that set aside a death penalty for a convicted murderer on the ground that the victim's mother should not have been permitted to testify before the jury.
The case, Ohio v. Huertas, No. 89-1944, could provide early evidence of the impact of Justice Brennan's retirement, since his vote was crucial in the earlier decision. Advance Publicationsd(The New Yorker)

HEADLINE: REPORT SAYS E.P.A. NEGLECTS ECOLOGY

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHABECOFF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
A report ordered by Administrator William K. Reilly says the Environmental Protection Agency has neglected the care of natural ecological systems by focusing instead on risks to human health, though the two are directly related and should be analyzed together.
While the agency's singular approach to problems has produced demonstrable benefits, the report says, the agency is failing to attain many national environmental goals and should reorder its priorities to encompass a broader strategy.
The report, prepared by the agency's Science Advisory Board, found that in stressing the regulation of single environmental risks, like the risk of an individual chemical to human health, the agency sets priorities and commits resources in ways that frequently make a poor match with the actual risks posed by environmental problems.
''In a sense, what this report says is that we have come to the end of the command-and-control regulation era in which we addressed environmental problems one by one,'' said Jonathan Lash, director of the Environmental Law Center of the Vermont Law School, who is co-chairman of the committee that produced the study. ''That approach has been enormously effective, but we have reached the point of diminishing returns in achieving our goals through such regulations.'' 
 
'Reconsider Our Best Strategy'
In a telephone interview on Friday, Mr. Reilly said: ''This is an opportunity to redefine our mission. It asks us to reconsider the best strategy for reducing risk and protecting health and the environment. As that question is asked, we will open vast new opportunities.''
Mr. Reilly said his agency's budget request for the fiscal year 1992 would reflect the need for a broader variety of tools in addressing ecological problems. ''We are at a point of transition,'' he said.
The board, which is made up of scientists and other outside experts, identified a number of ''relatively high risk'' problems that in many cases were receiving inadequate attention. The high-risk problems include the alteration and destruction of natural systems like wetlands and forests, the loss of biological diversity as a result of habitat destruction and pollution, and a gradual warming of the earth anticipated from industrial gases in the atmosphere that are trapping radiation from the sun.
 
Little Coordination Cited
Other important risks cited by the report are toxic substances in the air, worker exposure to dangerous chemicals, indoor air pollution and the pollution of drinking water.
Relatively lower environmental risks are presented by oil spills, low-level radiation, acid runoff into lakes and streams and the pollution of underground water sources, the report said.
Although the agency is dealing with most of these issues in some fashion, it does not do so in a coordinated way, nor does it devote resources commensurate with the risks, said the report, which was released last week.
The report, ''Reducing Risk: Setting Priorities and Strategies for Environmental Protection,'' noted that the nation is now spending about $100 billion a year to meet the requirements of the environmental statutes, including the clean air and water and toxic substances laws.
 
Humanity and Ecology Tied
It went on to say: ''Those efforts have led to very real national benefits. The staggering human health and ecological problems apparent throughout Eastern Europe suggest the price this country would be paying now had it not invested heavily in pollution controls.
''Yet despite the demonstrable success of past national efforts to protect the environment, many national environmental goals still have not been attained.''
The report said the environmental agency's emphasis on human health and relative neglect of ecological issues was ''inappropriate, because in the real world, there is little distinction between the two.''
''Over the long term, ecological degradation either directly or indirectly degrades human health and the economy,'' the Science Advisory Board report stated. Beyond their importance to human health and the economy, these ecological systems have ''an intrinsic moral value that must be measured in its own terms and protected for its own sake.''
Accordingly, the report said, environmental policy should focus on the ''real'' risks and cost to the economy, or the nation and the world will face increasing threats to both public health and global ecological systems.
Among the recommendations of the science board were these:
* The E.P.A. should focus its efforts on opportunities for the greatest risk reduction.
* It should attach as much importance to reducing ecological risks as it does to reducing risks to human health.
* It should do a better job of acquiring and analyzing environmental data.
* It should make greater use of tools other than regulation, including economic incentives to reduce pollution and public information to inform the public of environmental risks.
* The agency should integrate its environmental programs with broader public policies involving energy, agriculture, taxes and foreign affairs.
Mr. Lash said the study was, in effect, calling for ''a change of cultures for the agency.''
''It means the E.P.A. has to go beyond being a simple regulatory agency to become the locus of environmental planning, policy and values for this country,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Some Say Mining Company's Move Could Thwart U.S. Plan for Cleanup

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SMELTERVILLE, Idaho, Sept. 26

 BODY:
Seven years after it was designated one of the nation's most polluted industrial sites, Idaho's Silver Valley remains contaminated with vast amounts of lead, and Government officials say the companies responsible for the pollution are trying to avoid paying their share of the cleanup costs.
Just as contractors have begun tearing up toxic backyards in this devastated mining community, the company identified as the major polluter is moving many of its assets overseas, raising fears here over who will pay for medical benefits and a possible $200 million cleanup bill.
For decades, heavy doses of lead rained down on the valley from the lead and zinc smelter and sluiced through its waterways, poisoning a generation of children and deforesting entire mountainsides.
Although the Bunker Hill smelter, which was the major cause of the pollution, has been closed since 1981, recent tests show that children are still being contaminated with lead in the soil. Lead ingestion can cause nerve, brain and kidney damage and can impair fetal development in pregnant women. Can Law Be Skirted? Critics here, and within the Environmental Protection Agency, point to Bunker Hill as an illustration of how a law designed to make polluters pay can be skirted by international maneuvering. 
''As soon as the Federal Government starts to target some of these bigger companies, they move offshore and out of reach,'' said Hugh Kaufman, a veteran of the E.P.A. from its first days, who now serves as an assistant to the director of the agency's hazardous-waste division.
Officials with the Gulf Resources and Chemical Corporation of Boston, which ran the mining and smelting complex here until it closed in 1981, say they are shifting many of their assets to New Zealand because of a change in the company's management and emphasis. The company president, David J. Rowland, said in a letter sent to Silver Valley residents last week that the company has been unfairly singled out as the major culprit in poisoning the valley, a 21-square-mile swath in the Coeur d'Alene Mountains with a population of 5,000, ''It is not now nor has it ever been the intent of Gulf to sidestep any responsibilities,'' Mr. Rowland wrote. ''We continue to pay our share while others have failed to pay their share.''
 
Worried Over Shift
But Government attorneys say they are worried that Gulf's moves into New Zealand will make it difficult to collect costs of the cleanup. Under the Superfund law governing cleanups at hazardous-waste sites, if the responsible parties refuse to pay, the Government can do the cleanup itself and bill companies for three times the cost.
The company, no relation to the oil giant, has $292 million in total assets, according to its most recent financial statment. The cleanup of the Silver Valley, layered in some places with 70 feet of toxic waste, could cost up to $200 million, the Government says. Gulf has moved at least $100 million of its assets into New Zealand, said Lawrence J. Mehl, the corporate counsel and vice president.
Last year, when Gulf tried to reorganize itself in Bermuda, the Justice Department obtained a consent decree in which the company agreed to leave $185 million in the United States for future cleanup. The Bermuda move has since been abandoned, Mr. Mehl said, and the consent decree does not apply to the company's new investments in New Zealand.
''We're concerned that they are going into New Zealand to make it more difficult for us to enforce a judgment against them,'' said Ted Yakulic, assistant regional counsel for the E.P.A. in Seattle.
 
'Clean Up the Mess'
In the meantime, seven years after the Silver Valley was named a Superfund site, tests show that children are still being contaminated with lead from the soil.
''I think it's Gulf's responsibility to stay here and clean up the mess it left behind,'' said Theda Hill, who's lived in the Silver Valley all her life. She was visiting her mother, Violet Vukasin, in the town of Kellogg on the day contractors were ripping up Mrs. Vukasin's lawn and replacing it with lead-free soil.
Although mining in this mineral-rich valley has been going on for more than a hundred years, the worst pollution occurred in the last two decades, and it came from a smelter which used to produce 20 percent of the nation's lead and zinc. Gulf, which owned the Bunker Hill Smelter from 1968 to 1982, has admitted that it operated its smokestacks for two years without the necessary filter. in 1973 alone, 30 tons of lead per square mile were deposited on communites clustered beneath the smelter. In testing conducted by the Centers for Disease Control at the time, nearly 200 children were found to be suffering from acute lead poisoning, with contamination levels so high that many of them required hospitalization.
''My dad wouldn't even let me blow bubble gum because you'd get lead inside you just by opening your mouth,'' said Angela Cochran, who was a child living here in the 1970's.
 
Digging Up Lawns
In the last decade under government pressure, Gulf has spent about $9 million on studies, legal fees, and remedial measures associated with the cleanup. In addition, a lawsuit, brought by parents of the ''leaded children,'' as they were called, was settled out of court in 1981, for a reported $8.8 million.
Since then, Government health officials have continued to find elevated lead levels in the blood of children living here. Last year, eight children were found to be contaminated. About 1,800 homes need to have their lawns dug up and the soil replaced to a depth of one foot, according to the E.P.A. Schoolyards have already been cleaned. The biggest source of lead, the defunct smelter complex, will be the mostly costly part of the entire cleanup.
This summer, the yards of 117 homes were excavated, at a cost of about $23,000 per home - nearly twice the value of the average house in this depressed valley.
The concerns over who will pay for the cleanup have complicated efforts to transform the valley into a tourist-based economy. Like other former mining towns in the West, the Silver Valley is trying to become a ski destination. With the help of the Federal Government, there is now a three-mile-long gondola, billed as the world's longest, operating out of the town of Kellogg.
 
Official Disputes Criticism
Other companies said to be responsible for despoiling this valley were allowed to deplete the assets of their mining companies by a Government administrator who blocked and delayed enforcement actions, according to a Federal report.
The administrator, Robie Russell, who ran the E.P.A.'s Pacific Northwest division from 1986 through 1989, ''took extraordinary steps to prevent formal enforcement actions from being initiated against the owners'' of the Bunker Hill mining site, the Inspector General of the E.P.A. wrote earlier this year. Mr. Russell denies the accusation, saying he acted properly as regional administrator.
Mr. Russell said that, as regional adminstrator of the E.P.A., he focused on helping move the economy along in the valley. An Idaho native, he said in an interview that he is being unfairly singled out for the lack of cleanup activity on the site during his tenure with the Government.
Mr. Russell ''took extraordinary steps to prevent formal enforcement actions from being initiated against the owners of the Bunker Hill Superfund site,'' wrote John C. Martin, Inspector General of the E.P.A., last January. ''As a result, the smelter complex was allowed to deteriorate.''
By delaying action, Mr. Russell allowed owners of some of the mines in the Silver Valley to ''move company assets to other corporations through stock and property transfers which is expected to complicate attempts to recover cleanup costs,'' the inspector general wrote.
Mr. Russell said little action was taken because of the cumbersome nature of what he called ''the bureaucratic process.'' He disputed the conclusions of the report, saying, ''I did the best job I could, and I didn't do anything wrong.''
 
Other Parties Cited
Several mining companies, some of them owned by Idaho's wealthiest businessmen, have since been named in addition to Gulf as parties reponsible for the cleanup.
Residents of the Silver Valley are circulating a petition calling on the Justice Department to name a special prosecutor and investigate why it took so long for cleanup measures to begin.
''It's absolutely criminal what happened to this valley,'' said Barbara Miller of the Idaho Citizens Network, which has been active in the campagn to restore the area's environment. ''Nobody's ever gone to jail for it, and nobody's paid for the full cost.''

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET AGREEMENT: The Opposition;
Rebellion Flares Among Republicans Over Accord

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Civil war broke out among Republicans today as dozens of House members insisted that White House lobbying would not stop them from seeking to thwart the budget package announced on Sunday.
The rebellion against the plan, which includes major tax increases that will fall most heavily on people of moderate means, was particularly strong among conservative Republicans. Their strength was magnified by the defection of a member of the party leadership, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip.
''It is my conclusion that it will kill jobs, weaken the economy, that the tax increase will be counterproductive,'' Mr. Gingrich said as he emerged from a meeting at which top White House officials tried to persuade House Republicans to support the plan. ''And it is not a package that I can support. We need to do better than this.'' 
As much as anything, the opposition was driven by elections that are five weeks away. To many Republicans, voting for a plan calling for new taxes is tantamount to forfeiting the best issue they have against Democrats. An attempt to scuttle the agreement fits the strategy of some conservatives to portray Congress as a corrupt institution controlled by liberals who want nothing but higher taxes.
 
'Unreasonable and Irresponsible'
Democrats are also in the middle of re-election campaigns, and are particularly sensitive about the political repercussions from voting for cuts in domestic programs. Representative Henry A. Waxman, a liberal Democrat from California, vowed to oppose the package, asserting that increases in Medicare premiums and cuts in how much doctors and hospitals would receive from the Government were ''unreasonable and irresponsible.''
Representative Vin Weber of Minnesota, a member of the Republican leadership, offered this advice to his party's candidates: ''The candidates across the country who are listening to us for some signals today, they should take on this agreement, label it a Democrat tax increase agreement that was basically stuffed down our President's throat. They should oppose it out in the hinterlands.''
But Vice President Dan Quayle; John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff; Richard G. Darman, the budget director, and other top officials spent much of today seeking to persuade House Republicans that they would look better at the polls having supported a package that the President strongly wanted to win approval.
 
Risks for Both Parties
''If they are thinking in strictly political terms,'' Mr. Quayle said after meeting with House Republicans, ''I think it would be politically risky not to pass a good budget package. If, in fact, a budget package is not passed, all are going to suffer, the Republicans as well as the Democrats.''
White House officials said that because of the opposition of Mr. Gingrich and the core of conservatives, the toughest selling job would be among House Republicans. And no one on either side was willing to predict whether the lobbying effort would be successful, at least on a first pass.
Representative Dan Burton, an Indiana Republican, said, ''This is guerrilla war, and you may rest assured that whatever it takes to scuttle this terrible budget package, we will do it.''
Representative Dick Armey, a Texas Republican, was among several conservatives who said the plan would touch off a recession. ''The historians will look back and call this is pre-plummet summit,'' he said.
Some Republicans, however, declared their support for the plan and emphasized that the conservatives did not speak for the their entire caucus.
Representative Jerry Lewis of California, who heads the House Republican Conference, said that among House Republicans ''my guess is there's 25 percent on each end who have really made up their mind, but there's a sizable number of the conference that are kind of in neutral.''
''We're going to see movement back and forth,'' he predicted. ''My guess is that a majority of our caucus will end up supporting the package - I didn't say that yesterday.''
Another Republican, Representative Jim Leach of Iowa, was less hopeful. ''At the moment, it's not close to half,'' he said. ''What it symbolizes is there is no more fun in legislating. The fun is in giving tax breaks. The 90's are all going to be about taking.''
White House officials who fanned out across Capitol Hill to lobby reluctant Republicans were careful in their public comments not to underestimate the resistance among their party's House contingent, whose members were described as courteous but cool at meetings with Administration officials.
''It's going to come slowly,'' Mr. Darman said after appealing to House Republicans' loyalty to the President. ''It's going to be difficult. It's going to be hard.''

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET AGREEMENT: The Talks;
Capital Gains and Circles Within Inner Circles: Behind the Budget Accord

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Ten days of tedious and seemingly unproductive bargaining at Andrews Air Force Base in early September laid the groundwork for the budget compromise that President Bush and Congressional leaders unveiled at the White House on Sunday.
They called the sessions at the base in suburban Maryland ''Camp Runamuck,'' a chaotic blur of days and nights in which lawmakers from both parties postured, politicked and found little to agree on except the high quality of the food. But, according to interviews today that gave at least a partial picture of the long process that lead to the agreement, two developments occurred that would eventually prove important in sealing the pact.
The House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, who was heading the talks, and Richard G. Darman, the White House budget director, established their own private sessions, ostensibly meeting each day to plan logistics, but, in fact, spending hours discussing areas in which the two sides might come together.
 
Core of Tax Plan
At the same time, members of the negotiating team who serve on the Congressional tax-writing committees were meeting separately from the larger group. They slowly put together a package of items to raise revenues, which, unlike a cut in the capital gains tax or a limit on deductions for state and local taxes, were relatively noncontroversial. 
When the talks at Andrews ended in deadlock on Sept. 17, Congressional Democrats and Republicans and the Administration had tentatively agreed on $59 billion of such noncontroversial tax items. Those items would ultimately become the core of a five-year plan to raise $134 billion in taxes.
''The exit offers we left with from Andrews were political documents,'' one Democrat involved in the talks said, explaining that the offers were intended to show that neither side had given ground on major issues but had made a sincere effort. ''They were designed to cover our rear ends in case the whole thing blew up.''
 
The 'Big Eight'
The negotiators agreed that if there was any hope of a compromise, the talks would have to be confined to a smaller group consisting of the top five Congressional leaders and the Administration's three representatives, Mr. Darman, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff.
In addition to Mr. Gephardt, the Democrats were represented by House Speaker Thomas S. Foley of Washington and the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine. The Senate minority leader Bob Dole of Kansas and the House minority leader, Robert H. Michel of Illinois, represented Congressional Republicans.
By the time the ''Big Eight'' resumed deliberations on Capitol Hill on Sept. 18, it was clear that resolution of the deadlock hinged on two issues: Would the Democrats agree that the Social Security program should bear a share of the spending cuts and would Republicans abandon President Bush's goal of a cut in the capital gains tax or accept a Democratic demand that tax rates be increased to pay for it.
Democrats say Mr. Sununu made clear that the White House had to extract a concession on Social Security to balance the political heat Mr. Bush had already taken for agreeing to consider tax increases. Their own strategy also came together. Match the Administration on spending cuts and isolate the tax issue to embarrass the White House.
For two days, the top-level negotiating group circled around the issues, going nowhere. In Republican strategy sessions, Senator Phil Gramm of Texas, part of the larger Republican negotiating team, argued that Democrats would eventually accept a capital gains cut because so many of their rank and file members actually favored the reduction.
Mr. Michel, convinced that restive House Republicans would never agree to any measure that could be construed as an increase in tax rates, counseled otherwise. Mr. Dole, and moderate Republicans who were not part of the negotiating group, watched with mounting frustration as the press reported a budget deadlock caused by the President's demand for tax breaks that would help the rich.
On Wednesday night, Sept. 19, Senator Dole reached the breaking point, those close to the talks said. Separate the cuts in capital gains from the other issues, he suggested at a late night bargaining session. If it worked, fine, he said. If it did not, at least Republicans would not be blamed for blocking an agreement.
Capital Gains Breakthrough Throughout the discussions, the Republican's capital gains proposal called for reducing the rate to 15 percent. Capital gains, the profits on sales of assets like stock or real estate, are currently taxed at the same rate as ordinary income, 28 percent for most taxpayers.
Among the negotiators, Mr. Dole's proposal went nowhere. Although Democrats had been pondering a similar notion, they were nearly as surprised as the White House that Mr. Dole had suggested it, and they watched silently as Mr. Sununu blew up.
''We saw a Republican fissure and we did our best to keep quiet,'' is how one Democratic strategist explained it.
In negotiations on Sept. 20, Republicans offered two new proposals. One would address the Democratic demand to even out tax rates paid by the wealthiest Americans and those with incomes in the $100,000 to $200,000 range and would provide a two-tier tax rate on capital gains - a higher rate for old assets and a lower one for newly acquired assets. The other proposal would abandon any effort to change the capital gains tax if the Democrats would drop their demand for higher taxes on wealthy Americans.
In addition, the Republicans sought an extension of an expiring business tax credit for research and development and various other tax breaks for smaller businesses.
Stunned Democrats ignored the first offer and began responding to the second, realizing that the logjam on capital gains had finally been broken.
By Monday night, Sept. 24, however, Republicans appeared to reverse course, offering a proposal to exclude from taxes the portion of capital gains solely due to inflation.
Democrats said that proposal, like a cut in the capital gains tax, would require a tax increase on the wealthy to balance out expected losses in revenues and keep the tax system progressive. As Democratic staff members searched for tax alternatives that would accomplish that goal without running afoul of the Republican stricture that rates not be increased, Mr. Mitchell became increasingly agitated, one Democrat who was present recalled.
Slamming down his yellow legal pad, he turned to other Democrats in a private party caucus and complained that the situation seemed hopeless because the most efficient method for raising revenue and keeping the tax code progressive was a rate increase, and that avenue was blocked.
At the White House, Administration officials were coming to a similar conclusion. President Bush began talking less about capital gains in his public appearances and referring instead to ''growth incentives.''
''You saw us backing away from capital gains, or if not exactly backing away from it, then recognizing that there might be another way to skin the cat in terms of capital incentives,'' one Administration official said. ''Signals were being sent in public statements and in private.''
 
Visible Animosity
By Tuesday, Sept. 25, the animosity between Congressional Republicans and the White House was barely disguised, and Mr. Michel began sending some public signals of his own. He told reporters that the price for capital gains had simply become too high.
Earlier that day, Mr. Sununu and Mr. Darman incurred the wrath of Senate Republicans by suggesting at a private luncheon meeting that the President could use his executive authority to ease the impact of the automatic spending cuts, due to start on Oct. 1 if no agreement was reached. The President, they said, could exempt certain essential services from the cuts.
On Thursday night, Sept. 27, Democrats and Congressional Republicans thought the breakthrough was at hand. Democrats proposed a capital gains tax cut of their own accompanied by a plan to raise top income rates for the wealthy from 28 percent to 32 percent, just a percentage point higher than the proposal Republicans had suggested several days earlier.
''We were stunned when Sununu didn't take it,'' said one Democratic strategist. ''He gave a speech saying that the President could not accept that.'' A dejected Mr. Michel left the talks late that night, telling reporters, ''We're so close, but not quite there.''
The negotiators worked through the night on Saturday, eventually finding enough spending cuts elsewhere to avoid any changes in the Social Security program. Exhausted staff members rushed to put the final documents together in time for a hastily convened announcement in the White House Rose Garden on Sunday afternoon.
''It's good to be back to life and taking fluids again,'' Mr. Gephardt said today.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET AGREEMENT: The Experts' View;
Aches Aside, An Eclectic Accord That Economists Say Seems to Fit

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
''There's a puff of smoke here and a glint of mirrors there,'' said one grudgingly satisfied Congressional staff member. ''But the budget deal is mostly made of beef.''
His sense of relief is shared by many economists, who have been hoping for a compromise on the contentious issues that delayed the budget settlement until the 11th hour. For while almost none are impressed by the hodge-podge of tax increases and spending cuts, the size and timing of the projected deficit reduction seems about right to all. 
The agreement is perhaps most notable for what it does not contain. President Bush was forced to give way on his effort to reduce taxes on capital gains. Congressional Democrats lost their bid to raise income tax rates for families making more than $200,000. And reformers in both parties threw in the towel on a plan to trim Social Security payments to affluent beneficiaries.
 
A Little of This and That
What did emerge from the negotiations was a little of this and a little of that - a mix of excise taxes, user charges, limits on income tax deductions, military spending and farm subsidy cuts and Medicare trims. First-year deficit reduction amounts to $40 billion. But by the fifth year the savings have grown to about $150 billion.
Budget definitions were juggled to meet targets imposed by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit reduction law: Roughly $100 billion needed for the savings and loan bailout over the next three years will not be counted. So, too, were assumptions about the economy's midterm prospects - assumptions that David Hale, an economist at Kemper Financial Services calls ''pure fantasy.''
The budget brokers guessed, for example, that in 1995 the Treasury would be able to borrow money at 4.2 percent interest (down from 7 percent today), and that a combination of the highest growth rate since the 1960's and the lowest inflation rates since the 1950's would jack up tax revenues and tame spending.
But such political legerdemain, now a routine of every budget crisis, is not likely to upset economic analysts. Fiscal experts like Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution have long insisted that the savings and loan bailout does not belong in the budget. Deficits and surpluses, he argues, are useful as indicators of the Government's impact on on overall economic activity. And spending on the bailout, money returned to insured bank depositors, is unlikely to affect their spending or savings behavior because they never thought they lost the cash in the first place.
 
Outlook on the Deficit
What is more, the budget negotiators have actually weighted the deficit game against themselves in the later years by excluding a portion of what is conventionally defined as the Social Security surplus. In 1994, for example, the combined effect of excluding both Social Security and the savings and loan bailout increases the projected deficit by $128 billion.
For political reasons this five-year plan, like many in the past, shows a zero deficit in the last year. That still does not mean the deal will eliminate the deficit by anyone's definition. But to Benjamin Friedman, an economist at Harvard and a leading critic of the fiscal policies of the 1980's, ''there's nothing magic about a balanced budget.'' Indeed, in the view of many economists, there would be real mischief done is attempting to balance the budget too quickly.
For Mr. Hale, the $40 billion reduction next year is ''about right.'' Any less restraint on national spending and the budget deal would lack political credibility; any more, and an already sluggish economy could easily slip into deep recession. In later years the deficit restraint would cut more deeply. But by then, Mr. Friedman points out, the Federal Reserve will have had time to compensate with lower interest rates, ''giving monetary policy a chance to make a graceful transition.''
With a little luck, America will enter the mid-1990's with a budget deficit of about 1 percent of the Gross National Product - roughly one-third the level of the late 1980's. Is that good enough?
It would not displease Mr. Friedman, who despite his reputation as a ''neo-Calvinist'' economist, would be satisfied by any deal that allows a decline in the ratio of the national debt to national income. And it would probably also satisfy economists who worry that Japanese and German investors are rapidly losing their enthusiasm for lending money to the United States Treasury. ''This is the first fiscal reform'' Mr. Hale notes, ''which was driven by international finance.''
What it would not do, however, is make fiscal room for a surge in public and private investment - a surge that some economists believe is needed to cure ills ranging from chronic poverty to lagging productivity growth. But as Mr. Hale suggests, it may be wiser to focus on ''one deal at a time.''

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET AGREEMENT: The Accountants;
Profession Sees Slight Pickup, but No Boom

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
Accountants and tax advisers said yesterday that the budget accord would pry open some, but not many, loopholes that individuals and businesses could use to reduce their taxes.
''It's not like the 1986 tax law, where we had a total overhaul of the tax code,'' said Mark E. Bloom, a tax partner at the accounting firm of BDO Seidman, fondly recalling the last time a legislative package produced a bonanza for the accounting profession.
Indeed, the sense was that taxpayers who are affected by the new taxes will find few ways to avoid them, short of doing the unthinkable: cutting consumption of highly taxed luxury goods or taking a lower-paying job. 
''Tax returns won't be more complicated,'' said Stan Ross, the managing partner of Kenneth Leventhal & Company, a mid-sized accounting firm. ''You'll just have to pay more taxes.'' Slight Pickup Expected Nor is the accounting profession bracing for the sort of heightened demand for its services that might have resulted had Congress agreed to cut taxes on capital gains, as the Bush administration had urged. That would have stimulated a one-time burst in transactions by sellers who had been waiting for a drop in capital gains taxes, and it would have kept a lot of tax professionals busy dusting off some of their pre-1986 strategies for converting ordinary gains into capital gains.
Still, the accountants do expect their business to pick up slightly. ''There's been so much tax legislation over the last few years that the accounting firms have gotten very good at exploiting the opportunities, and I expect this will be no different,'' said Robert Willens, a tax and accounting expert at Lehman Brothers.
Specifically, he said, accountants would be sought after if the final package required taxpayers to make certain complex calculations that they would be happier leaving to their tax preparers. For instance, the proposed accord allows investors in small businesses to consider the effects of inflation when calculating the gain on their investment.
A second place where accountants might be helpful is helping high-income taxpayers figure out how to time certain tax-deductible expenses to minimize the financial loss they would suffer from having less use of those deductions than in the past. ''That just adds another complication to the 1040 and undoubtedly will take some explaining,'' Mr. Willens said.
The accountants advised their clients to buy luxury goods like cars before a costly new excise tax kicks in, and to hold off buying stakes in small businesses until it can be determined which businesses qualify for the new tax breaks that are designed to stimulate economic growth.
The biggest area of concern to individuals or couples who make more than $100,000 a year is the difficulty they might face using certain tax-deductible expenses like mortgage payments to lower the taxes they owe.
 
Prepayments a Possibility
Tax experts advised those clients that they should take many such expenses in the current year before the window shuts, and possibly even prepay certain 1991 expenses, like their January mortgage payments, charitable contributions and state and local taxes.
Although no one is predicting a rebirth of the tax shelter industry, there may be some limited activity in packaging real estate deals designed to take advantage of the tax incentives being made available to developers who build in economically depressed zones, according to Mr. Ross. ''Some of our developers will be looking at it,'' said Mr. Ross, whose firm specializes in the real estate industry.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET AGREEMENT: The Executive View - Budget Pact Regarded As Mixed for Business;
Gasoline: Charging Drivers, Helping Drillers

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The deficit-reduction plan agreed upon by President Bush and Congressional negotiators brought praise from the Business Roundtable as ''necessary'' and ''good for the country.'' While most businesses seem willing to accept new taxes if they would strengthen the economy by reducing the deficit, the impact of the pact would vary by industry. Here is a look at how some key sectors might be affected. 
Oil experts predicted a modest impact from the 12-cent-a-gallon increase in gasoline taxes contained in the dificit-cutting plan.
They were less certain about the likely effect of the $4 billion package of tax incentives for the drilling industry, but most said it could slow the decline in American oil production.
The gasoline tax, the largest revenue measure in the package, drew quick condemnation from the American Automobile Association, which called it ''reckless public policy in the face of a recession.''
Still, the impact would be small in terms of the cost of driving a car. The association estimates that at $1.25 a gallon, a typical price at the beginning of this summer, driving 100 miles cost $8.60 for oil and gas. Adding 12 cents a gallon to the price would increase the cost of the 100-mile trip for late-model cars by less than 50 cents.
The effect on consumption will probably be small, experts said. John H. Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York, expects consumption to decline by about 1 percent after the tax has been in effect for a year.
The $4 billion in drilling incentives over five years could have a major impact, experts said. Overall expenditures on exploration and development of oil and gas were $24 billion in 1988, according to the American Petroleum Institute. That comes to about half what would be required to hold imports to the level of the early 1980's, said Richard D. Dole, the head of the energy and natural resources practice at Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm. In the early 1980's, the United States imported about a third of its oil; now it imports half, while domestic oil production fell about 25 percent in the last decade.
Relative to current exploration budgets, the subsidy figures ''aren't big numbers,'' Mr. Dole said. But he added that the tax changes could encourage exploration and slow the rate of decline in production.

Defense: After Iraq, Shallower Cuts

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
The deficit-reduction plan agreed upon by President Bush and Congressional negotiators brought praise from the Business Roundtable as ''necessary'' and ''good for the country.'' While most businesses seem willing to accept new taxes if they would strengthen the economy by reducing the deficit, the impact of the pact would vary by industry. Here is a look at how some key sectors might be affected. 
The defense industry would fare better than had been expected in the Government's budget-cutting proposals - at least better than was expected before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, when talk was of cutting miltary budgets.
But with the legislative horse-trading of the budget process still unfolding, analysts and executives caution, the Pentagon could be marked for further cuts if Congress resists the proposed reductions in politically sensitive social programs.
For military suppliers, the crucial step will come when individual procurement programs are scrutinized. ''The next stage is the part we will watch with particular care, because that's when we'll see where the cuts come from in terms of specific programmatic areas,'' said Miriam Reid, a spokeswoman for the Grumman Corporation.
The deficit-reduction accord calls for Pentagon spending in the fiscal year that began yesterday of about $297 billion, a cut of $10 billion, or 3.3 percent, after inflation. The proposal is in line with the recommendations of the Senate Armed Services Committee, but it would be less than the amount sought by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney.
''It's better than it could have been for the industry, but not as good as Cheney wanted to have it,'' said Lawrence J. Korb, a former Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Reagan Administration who is now with the Brookings Institution, a research group.
''If you had not had the situation in Iraq, you would have had an Aspin budget,'' Mr. Korb said, referring to Representative Les Aspin, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, which has called for far deeper cuts and the elimination of some big programs like the B-2 Stealth bomber.

Tobacco: Possible Push For Discounts

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The deficit-reduction plan agreed upon by President Bush and Congressional negotiators brought praise from the Business Roundtable as ''necessary'' and ''good for the country.'' While most businesses seem willing to accept new taxes if they would strengthen the economy by reducing the deficit, the impact of the pact would vary by industry. Here is a look at how some key sectors might be affected. 
The proposed rise in cigarette excise taxes, which was less than the industry expected, could hurt tobacco sales over the next few years. But the longer-term effect may be to prod the companies to more aggressively market cut-priced cigarette that are somewhat less profitable than well-known brands, industry officials and securities analysts say.
An earlier budget proposal called for a 16-cent increase on each pack, so the 8-cent rise over three years seemed moderate. The proposed tax increase, which is still open to revision by Congress, is expected to raise about $5.9 billion over the next five years.
Cigarette sales have declined for more than 25 years, but especially so in the last decade, because of health concerns, antismoking campaigns, higher taxes and regular price increases. It is an industry rule of thumb that a 10 percent rise in retail prices is likely to lead to a 3 percent decline in sales. Today, a pack of cigarettes averages $1.60. Last year, smokers paid about $4.3 billion in Federal excise taxes on nearly 524 billion cigarettes. That was 16 cents on a pack that last year averaged about $1.49. Total retail sales in 1989 were about $39 billion. Next year, smokers are set to pay 20 cents in Federal tax and 24 cents in 1993.
The Philip Morris Companies, which makes Marlboro, is the industry leader with more than 40 percent of the domestic market. John R. Nelson, a spokesman for Philip Morris USA, declined to comment on the proposed excise tax, but he noted that Philip Morris makes discount brands, which the industry calls price/value cigarettes. If full-price brands are hurt by higher taxes, he said, ''price/value is our safety net.''
Marc I. Cohen, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, estimated that large tobacco companies make about $33 in gross profit per 50 packs of full-price cigarettes. For discount brands, like RJR Nabisco's Doral and Philip Morris's Cambridge, they make about $21.

Airlines: Bigger Burden For Fliers

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

 BODY:
The deficit-reduction plan agreed upon by President Bush and Congressional negotiators brought praise from the Business Roundtable as ''necessary'' and ''good for the country.'' While most businesses seem willing to accept new taxes if they would strengthen the economy by reducing the deficit, the impact of the pact would vary by industry. Here is a look at how some key sectors might be affected. 
The airline industry responded angrily to the proposed budget package, saying its tax provisions would add $1.5 billion annually to the industry's costs.
Most, but not all, of that amount would be passed on to airline customers.
The budget deal increases the tax on passenger tickets to 10 percent from the current 8 percent. On a typical ticket of about $400, the tax would go from $32 to $40. Because the tax is calculated after the ticket's price is set, it is paid directly by the consumer.
The higher costs of flying might cause some drop in business for the airlines, but that effect is thought likely to be relatively modest.
But the airlines denounced the fact that the increases in ticket taxes are not being set aside for use on aviation programs, such as building new runways, installing better air traffic control radars, and paying controlers.
In the past, the entire ticket tax had been put into a trust fund earmarked for aviation programs. The increased ticket taxes instead are being used to reduce the deficit.
The airlines are also affected by a tax of 2 cents a gallon on all petroleum products. The tax would mark the first time jet fuel has been taxed by the Federal Government.
The Air Transport Association said that the 2-cent tax would cost the airlines $300 million. Like other fuel costs, these are not always passed directly to customers.
Robert J. Aaronson, president of the airline group, said the new taxes, which come on top of sharp recent increases in the cost of fuel, would ''seriously threaten'' the industry.
In recent months, the industry's costs have risen sharply and many analysts are predicting steep losses in the fourth quarter.

Small Business: Backing Goods Over Services

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
The deficit-reduction plan agreed upon by President Bush and Congressional negotiators brought praise from the Business Roundtable as ''necessary'' and ''good for the country.'' While most businesses seem willing to accept new taxes if they would strengthen the economy by reducing the deficit, the impact of the pact would vary by industry. Here is a look at how some key sectors might be affected. 
Most small businesses would benefit from the tax breaks for entrepeneurial companies included in the proposed budget agreement, but service concerns that created so many American jobs during the 1980's would be left out.
''It could be a real capital-formation tool for small business, no doubt about it,'' said John Paul Galles, executive vice president for National Small Business United in Washington. ''But there are a lot of businesses that won't benefit, including engineering firms, personnel training firms, consultants and others who play an important role in our competitiveness but are organized as partnerships or in other forms. It's shortsighted to exclude them.''
The key small-business proposal in the budget pact would allow individual taxpayers to subtract 25 percent of the amount they invest in stock in certain small businesses from their gross income, with a limit of $50,000 in any single year.
The small businesses that qualify are those that are organized under Chapter C of the Internal Revenue Code with less than $50 million in equity. The negotiators excluded Chapter C companies engaged in service activities, like banking and real estate.
However, the interaction between the new tax break and other tax provisions - such as the minimum tax provisions - may reduce some of the incentive for investors. Moreover, investors have to subtract the amount they deduct from their tax basis in the stock they buy. When they sell it, they will end up paying higher taxes (if it rose in value) or recording less of a loss (if it declined) than if they had not taken the deduction.
An influx of venture capital could bolster the price of small company stocks on Wall Street. Small companies might also have an easier time attacting investors with both initial public offerings and secondary issues to raise new capital.
The Bush Administration included the tax breaks for small businesses in the budget deal, after it gave up its effort to have the capital gains tax reduced.
''We wonder how it will really work,'' said Barry Saghal, director of research at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company. One key question: can venture capitalists assemble groups of individual investors into pools and pass the benefits on to each individual?

Agriculture: Paring the Core Of U.S. Policy

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

 BODY:
The deficit-reduction plan agreed upon by President Bush and Congressional negotiators brought praise from the Business Roundtable as ''necessary'' and ''good for the country.'' While most businesses seem willing to accept new taxes if they would strengthen the economy by reducing the deficit, the impact of the pact would vary by industry. Here is a look at how some key sectors might be affected. 
Cutting $13 billion over the next five fiscal years from Government payments to farmers - the core of American farm policy for more than half a century - would hurt hundreds of thousands of farmers, but just how severely the agricultural economy will be affected is unclear.
''It's going to be a painful, traumatic conference,'' said Representative E. de la Garza, a Texas Democrat and chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. ''The problem is we have to deal with places and faces. At the White House, they come up with these numbers out of a computer.''
Staff members of the House and Senate Agriculture Committees said farmers who grow corn, sorghum, wheat, rice, and cotton receive the bulk of Government payments and could receive the largest cuts. In the fiscal year 1990, for example, Federal spending on these five commodities was $4.3 billion of the $6.7 billion spent on all farm programs. Payments to corn growers alone amounted to $2.6 billion, according to the most recent analysis by the Agriculture Department.
If approved, the cuts would start in the fiscal year 1991, when $1.3 billion would be trimmed from the $7.8 billion that the Department of Agriculture originally expected to spend on payments to farmers who produce corn, cotton, wheat, rice, peanuts, tobacco, milk and nine other farm products. The remainder, $11.7 billion, will be phased in during the fiscal years 1992 through 1995.
The budget agreement comes in the midst of deliberations by a House-Senate conference committee to write a five-year farm policy law to replace the law that expires this year. Both versions of the law, which were passed this summer, call for spending on price support and other farm programs to total $54 billion to $56 billion over the next five fiscal years.

Alcoholic Beverages: Soft on Beer, Hard on Liquor

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ

 BODY:
The deficit-reduction plan agreed upon by President Bush and Congressional negotiators brought praise from the Business Roundtable as ''necessary'' and ''good for the country.'' While most businesses seem willing to accept new taxes if they would strengthen the economy by reducing the deficit, the impact of the pact would vary by industry. Here is a look at how some key sectors might be affected. 
The planned rise in alcohol taxes may cause a slight drop in sales of beer, but it is likely to have a more severe impact on the already-falling sales of wine and distilled spirits, like scotch and bourbon, industry analysts say.
The beer tax increase was far lower than the industry had expected. A previous proposal called for a 64-cent increase for a six-pack, but the budget negotiators settled on a 16-cent increase. Coupled with higher taxes on wine and liquor, the tentative tax measure is expected to raise $10 billion over the next five years.
Beer is the largest volume seller in the alcohol business, making up about 86 percent of the 6.75 billion gallons of alcoholic beverages sold last year, according to Impact Databank, an industry publication. Last year, beer drinkers paid about $1.7 billion in Federal excise taxes, or 16 cents on a six pack of beer, which typically retails between $3 and $4.
Unlike cigarette sales, beer sales have been growing modestly for the last 20 years and have only recently begun to flatten in the last year or so. In 1989, beer sales rose about four-tenths of 1 percent.
The Beer Institute, a trade group, has estimated that a doubling of the excise tax, as the budget negotiators have proposed, would lead to a 4 percent drop in sales.
The brewer most affected by the proposals is the Anheuser-Busch Companies, maker of Budweiser and industry leader with more than 40 percent of the market. Mark E. Abels, a spokesman, declined to comment.
Table wine taxes would rise to $1.27 a gallon from 17 cents, under the proposed budget accord. That is equivalent to 25 cents per 750-milliliter bottle, up from 3 cents. For distilled spirits, taxes would rise to $14 a 100-proof gallon from $12.50. The price impact per bottle would vary with different drinks.
The wine industry, whose sales declined at a nearly 1 percent annual rate for most of the 1980's, and the liquor business, which declined at double that in the period, may be further hurt by any tax rises.
Last year, wine sales totaled 438 million gallons, down 2.5 percent from the year earlier, according to Impact Databank. Sales in 1989 of distilled spirits totaled 371 million gallons, down about 1.9 percent.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET AGREEMENT: The Executive View - Budget Pact Regarded As Mixed for Business;
Research: An Incentive For Spending

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
The deficit-reduction plan agreed upon by President Bush and Congressional negotiators brought praise from the Business Roundtable as ''necessary'' and ''good for the country.'' While most businesses seem willing to accept new taxes if they would strengthen the economy by reducing the deficit, the impact of the pact would vary by industry. Here is a look at how some key sectors might be affected.
The measures to encourage research spending would have a minimal impact on most businesses, but they do favor smaller companies. The proposed budget's only nod to business in general was to extend the current 20 percent credit for any increase in research spending above recent levels (an average of the last three years in most cases) through the end of 1991. That credit had expired Sunday.
Business executives had expected some sort of extension because the credit, in one form or another, has been extended for one or two years repeatedly since it was first created in 1981. ''We are disappointed it isn't permanent, which would provide more incentive to work on long-term projects,'' said Ted Heidinger, the tax specialist at the Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association in Washington.
The budget proposal encourages small business research by giving qualifying companies an additional 10 percent tax credit for increases in research spending in 1991 (for a total of 30 percent). It also allows them to accelerate the depreciation of certain scientific equipment. Negotiators estimated these provisions might cost the Government several hundred million dollars.

HEADLINE: Mr. Dinkins's Grim Pay Precedent

 BODY:
With tax revenues falling and the economy continuing to worsen, New York City can ill afford the Dinkins administration's proposed 5.5 percent wage increase for the city's teachers' union. It sets a precedent for costly settlements with all of the other municipal labor unions and reinforces fears that the Mayor won't stand up to the unions that supported his candidacy.
The city claims that it is providing only a 1.5 percent increase. The balance of the raise, City Hall officials say, will come from state aid and a still unofficial plan to reduce contributions to the teachers' pension fund by altering its investment strategy. But any money realized from a new investment plan belongs to the city, not the union. Such funds could well go to pay for more police officers, help maintain bridges and roads, or help close next year's massive budget gap. 
That's not the only unfortunate precedent. The city could not have made a worse tactical mistake than to settle with the U.F.T. first. City Hall and even other union leaders have long acknowledged that because of equity, and competition from neighboring school districts, the teachers rated a slightly higher raise than other workers. Yet as the first settlement, the U.F.T.'s 5.5 percent is likely to become a floor for subsequent settlements, rather than the exception. Indeed, exuberant union leaders are unable to contain their glee. ''I think it's terrific,'' said Barry Feinstein, president of the teamsters' local. ''That now becomes my number.'' The city's willingness to settle for a one-year contract also spells trouble; it requires a new round of negotiations soon, and raises unrealistic hopes for an even more generous settlement next year -on a salary base inflated by the current settlement. City Hall responds naively that it expects the unions will accept sacrifice next year if necessary.
In the best of times, there is every justification for giving teachers the most attractive salaries possible. But these are not the best of times, and they may get worse. People in the private sector are losing jobs or absorbing wage cuts. It is not too much to ask public employees to do their share. Nor is it too much to ask the Mayor to get tough - and realistic - with the rest of the city unions.

HEADLINE: 'Opportunities' for Peace in the Gulf

 BODY:
Addressing the world's political leaders at the United Nations yesterday, President Bush sketchily but unmistakably outlined a sensible diplomatic solution for the Persian Gulf crisis. His words provide a basis for talks, if Saddam Hussein has the sense to respond before it's too late.
Mr. Bush's initiative supplies a needed third component to the global strategy for reversing Iraqi aggression. To the pressure provided by economic sanctions and the military buildup, the President adds fair terms for a durable peace. 
Mr. Bush spoke in a diplomatic code that might have eluded most listeners. He spoke of ''opportunities'' that could arise ''in the aftermath of Iraq's unconditional departure from Kuwait.'' He then listed three main opportunities.
First, he suggested that Iraq and Kuwait could ''settle their differences permanently.'' Decoded, this means resolving longstanding disputes involving the control of oil fields that straddle the present border, and jurisdiction over strategic islands in the gulf. It's not clear whether the phrase also extends to negotiations on the future government of Kuwait.
Second, he called on ''the states of the gulf themselves to build new arrangements for stability.'' Washington means three things by this: destroying chemical weapons and their means of production, curbing the spread of nuclear technology and negotiating the size and composition of military forces. It's clear the U.S. would want to subject the first two to international inspection. It's also clear, but unsaid, that Israeli chemical and nuclear-weapons capabilities would be included in such talks.
Third, ''for all the states and peoples of the region to settle the conflict that divides the Arabs from Israel.'' That means two things: ending the present state of war, with Arab states recognizing the state of Israel; and reaffirming the U.S. commitment to fostering direct negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians.
All three pieces fit together. Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait cannot by itself restore stability to the gulf. Stability requires limiting war-making capabilities in the region. Israel will not even begin to consider limits on its forces or nuclear and chemical weapons capabilities unless it is in the context of a general Middle East peace settlement. And Arabs would find it difficult to limit their own military forces without constraints on Israel.
With Saddam Hussein still to propose any serious settlement terms, Mr. Bush was wise not to spell out his own meanings. But he has now revealed enough of his hand to put the burden of the next negotiating move clearly on Iraq.

HEADLINE: The Budget: Ugly but Unavoidable

 BODY:
The budget agreement between Congressional leaders and the Bush Administration cuts defense too little. It increases energy taxes too little. It taxes rich families too little. Even so, the coarse compromise would cut the deficit by half a trillion dollars in five years and would accomplish that without savaging any one class, cohort or region. That doesn't warrant enthusiasm but it does warrant Congressional approval. 
Detailed evaluation of the plan is futile given the way it is being presented - on an all-or-nothing basis. The ''nothing'' is scary. Were Congress to reject the agreement, financial markets would be rocked by the message that even modest deficit reduction is impossible. And millions of Americans would be rocked by inevitable, massive program cuts that would continue until Congress figured out a way to pass a budget.
Budget chaos might be worth trying if there were reason to believe it would produce better. In truth, it is as likely to lead to worse.
The best part of the package is what it will not do. It won't throw the economy into recession, because next year's actual hit will be less than $35 billion, considerably less than the $50 billion target. Neither will the agreement wreck the tax code by giving in to President Bush's relentlessly misguided call for sweeping reductions of the capital gains tax.
And the budget bargainers wisely agreed to reduce, but not cap, the total amount of deductions that rich families are allowed to take. Reducing, but not capping, deductions is much fairer to urban areas like New York, which must impose high taxes to meet high social welfare burdens. The biggest ''losers'' in the budget package are farmers, Medicare providers and Medicare beneficiaries. Yet the proposals affecting them are just. Farm subsidies do little more than subsidize wealthy farmers at the expense of urban consumers. Cuts are long overdue.
Medicare is more complicated. The program would be unchanged. But beneficiaries would have to pay more; doctors and hospitals would have to accept less. For political reasons, the summiteers exempted Social Security, leaving Medicare to bear the brunt of the domestic cuts. But the cut is hardly catastrophic - $30 billion out of approximately $700 billion over the next five years, or 4 percent.
If there is a calamity in the plan, it is that the summiteers are squandering the peace dividend. Many billions should now be shifted from the military to domestic programs because of the end of the cold war. But the plan calls for maintaining defense outlays at the $290 billion level for three years. The pretext for such spending surrender is Saddam Hussein's invasion of Iraq. In fact, outlays could prudently drop to $275 billion by the third year.
Likewise, the negotiators settled for a mere 12 cents a gallon in energy taxes, rather than the 25 cents or more that the economy could stand and the environment deserves.
Such wrongs can be corrected. The budget law empowers Congress to fund new initiatives - for highways and other infrastructure, education and Eastern Europe - if it raises the necessary revenue. That would allow Congress to trim defense, set higher energy prices and impose more progressive taxes. This year's ugly compromise is acceptable only if Congress rights the wrongs next year.

HEADLINE: New York City Workers Have Sacrificed More Than Enough;
Beggars' License

 BODY:
To the Editor:
You urge Mayor David N. Dinkins to persuade municipal employees to accept wage increases below the inflation rate because of New York City's fiscal woes (editorial, Sept. 18).
Perhaps you would also support a proposal for identification cards, to be issued to municipal employees with their first paychecks under such contracts. On these cards would be embossed the employee's name and the service that employee performs for the city, for example, ''teacher,'' ''police officer.'' The cards would also bear the following message:
''I work for New York City and therefore am expected to lose effective payment for my services when the city has fiscal difficulty, although I am seldom granted more than a keep-even-with-inflation increase when times improve. You are therefore asked to reduce the cost of goods and services I buy from you, such as rent, transportation, clothing, food, medical, by an amount that will keep my payments at the same proportion of my salary rate as last year.
''Of course, you cannot be compelled to do this. Rather, I am compelled to beg for your discretionary charity, I will continue to work cheerfully and efficiently despite the message about my worth, and will not leave for employment in a higher-paying suburb.''

HEADLINE: New York City Workers Have Sacrificed More Than Enough

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I have a major quarrel with ''What's Fair for Unions, and the City?'' (editorial, Sept. 18), concerning New York City labor negotiations.
You note that fairness and city worker morale are important, and then you say the city is in a recession and sacrifices will have to be made. You urge a wage increase below the rate of inflation. 
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, prices rose in the New York area by 7 percent for the 12 months ending last month. The demand of this union before your editorial was considerably less than the inflationary rate. The situation may dictate that we demand more. Yet you scoff at even a reported 5 percent increase. How low is enough for you?
Have you forgotten such sacrifices city workers have made as:
* The $450 million the unions saved the city since 1989 by raising the interest assumption rate on pensions.
* The noncompounding of the last wage increase in 1989.
* The acceptance in the 1984-87 contract of 29 fewer vacation days for new hires in their first four years.
City workers have made sacrifices and continue to. We don't shirk our responsibility. However, the city has had more than its pound of flesh from city workers.
All New Yorkers will be hurt by the $900 million in new city taxes, including 130,000 taxpaying city workers. But you insist city workers pay those new taxes out of a wage increase well below the inflation rate.
You were on target in identifying aspects of a prospective contract. You thus reveal detailed, inside discussions, which show that the Dinkins administration's labor policy is doomed to failure.
The new administration in its first labor negotiations committed a sin of collective bargaining by letting a third party into private contract negotiations. It will be very difficult for this or any other labor leader to have exploratory talks with top city officials when the subject matter may become part of an editorial.
You smugly note that public unions wholeheartedly supported David N. Dinkins, and therefore the Mayor has a responsibility to prepare the work force for a settlement below inflation. Your logic escapes me. We seek nothing more of this Mayor than if the election had been different. Our demands are reasonable. We would anticipate that Mr. Dinkins or any other mayor would recognize this. This union will not negotiate its contract with you, and we hope the city will not negotiate with us through the news media.

HEADLINE: New York Police Seek 9,000 Officers

BYLINE: By RALPH BLUMENTHAL

 BODY:
After months of self-analysis, the New York City Police Department has called for expanding its forces by more than 9,000 officers - about a third already budgeted, a third coming from internal economies and replacement by civilian workers, and a third from money not yet found.
The plan, worked out in discussions between the police and senior city officials and to be made public today by Mayor David N. Dinkins, embodies sweeping changes in long-established police procedures, including a sharp scaling back of 911 emergency service, which has become the bane of the department.
It also seeks to shift to the Department of Correction and other city agencies jobs long borne by the police, freeing up hundreds of officers assigned to the Police Department's court division.
 
Transit and Housing Included
Mayor Dinkins must still come up with hundreds of millions of dollars to finance the plan, which would create the largest department in the city's history, well over the 31,000 of 1970. In addition to the new regular city police, the plan calls for 690 new transit and housing officers, beyond 762 additional officers already budgeted but not yet recruited or trained. 
Along with the beefing-up of forces, aides said that Mayor Dinkins would propose today that from now on, all new officers hired be required to be residents of the city. The change would require legislative approval.
Yesterday's figures provided by City Hall officials on the eve of the report's release and following a week of fluctuating leaked figures, broke down as follows:
* Beyond the 26,000 uniformed officers now, the department has identified a need for 9,603 additional officers on the streets.
* Roughly one-third, 3,124, would be made available by hiring about 2,700 additional civilian aides - there are about 7,500 now -who could replace officers in desk, training and staff jobs, allowing them to assume patrol duties; and the elimination, consolidation and sharing of other unit duties.
* About another third, 3,063, have already been provided for in the budget and are scheduled to go through the Police Academy between now and June 30. This number includes 1,058 additional officers added on by Mayor Dinkins earlier this year, 358 added on and financed by the City Council and about 1,700 ''attrition'' replacements for officers who retire.
* The third group, 3,416 officers, would be truly new - that is, they are neither already in the department in non-patrol jobs, nor have they been already budgeted or otherwise reckoned in department expansion plans.
Because the group of 3,063 that had already been budgeted was often not broken out by city officials, recent news accounts left the impression that nearly 6,000 ''new'' officers would be sought. In reality, little more than half that number were truly newfound troops.
The city's two specialized police forces would also grow under the plan.
The transit police, now 4,562 strong, would gain 440 new officers over the 442 already budgeted. And the housing police, now at 2,488, would gain 250 over the 320 already provided for.
Altogether, the 4,106 truly new officers proposed for the three departments would cost the city $215 million a year, including benefits, the report says. When the new civilian aides and other expenses are added the costs amount to $649 million, City Hall aides said yesterday.
The so-called manpower report, in the making since May, offers a unit-by-unit analysis of each component in the Police Department, where the staffing stands now and what it should be increased or reduced to.
 
Reducing 911 Calls
One of the more striking recommendations is a sharp reduction of the 4.1 million 911 emergency calls the department responds to a year - already less than half the 8.3 million that are telephoned in. By ''differentiating'' between true emergencies and calls that can be handled routinely, the department plans to save the equivalent of several hundred officers.
Similarly, 492 police officers are currently assigned to the court division, guiding prisoners through arraignments and other court appearances. These functions should be shifted to correction officers, freeing many more police officers for street duty, the report said.
In addition, it calls for the elimination of many small, special purpose units, such as the Safe, Loft and Truck Squad, an anti-hijacking unit whose functions are to be assumed by existing units.
The Detective Bureau, now below strength at under 2,500, is scheduled for augmentation by several hundred detectives, although some of the city-wide and borough functions are to be redistributed to precinct squads, in line with Commissioner Lee P. Brown's stated goal of moving as many operations to the local level as possible.

HEADLINE: 3 in Connecticut Focus on Taxes In a TV Debate

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW LONDON, Conn., Oct. 1

 BODY:
Connecticut's three major candidates for governor attacked one another for 90 minutes tonight in a televised debate that centered on budgets and taxes, and specifically on the plans put forward by the Republican nominee.
Representative Bruce A. Morrison, the Democratic candidate, and Lowell P. Weicker, a former Republican Senator running on his own Connecticut Party ticket, spent much of their allotted 30 minutes belittling a pledge by the Republican, Representative John G. Rowland, that he could cut state spending enough next year to avoid any tax increases, partly through forcing concessions from state employees.
Mr. Weicker said the plan was an empty promise, comparing it to George Bush's promise in the 1988 Presidential campaign not to raise taxes. Mr. Morrison said that the plan ''doesn't add up,'' and that it would alienate the state workers whose support will be needed next year to close the state's budget gap, which is expected to be as much as $1 billion in a budget of only $7 billion.
Mr. Rowland pushed back just as hard, accusing his opponents of not having enough courage to stand up for their own budget solutions. He said that the state, which already has the highest sales-tax rate in the nation, at 8 percent, and the highest corporate income tax in the nation, at 13.8 percent, has no options except to make deep and painful cuts in spending or to impose a personal income tax. 
 
Income Tax Issue
Mr. Rowland said that Mr. Weicker and Mr. Morrison would lead the state toward an income tax because of their reluctance to cut spending, while he would avoid an income tax and would veto one if it were proposed. Connecticut is one of only 10 states that does not tax wages, although it does tax income from dividends, interest and capital gains.
The debate, in a freewheeling format that allowed the candidates to rebut one another's remarks and charges for as long as they chose, included only five questions from a panel of journalists. Two of the questions concerned the candidates' plans for dealing with a weak economy and a battered state budget.
The other questions dealt with segregation in the state's cities, distribution of sterile needles as a way to fight AIDS and the perception that residents are growing more cynical toward government and politicians.
When that question came to Mr. Weicker, he paused, then said that only 10 members of the House had missed votes on Sunday on financing for the military buildup in Saudi Arabia and bills aimed at reducing the Federal budget deficit. The 10 included Mr. Rowland and Mr. Morrison, both of whom were ''politicking'' in Connecticut, Mr. Weicker said.
 
Economic Pain
Mr. Rowland then accused Mr. Weicker of being ''the biggest hypocrite in the entire United States Senate,'' for having repeatedly spoken about the need for public disclosure in campaign financing, but refusing to release his income-tax returns in the current campaign. Mr. Weicker released his tax statements last month, after repeated attacks by Mr. Morrison.
''Let's stipulate something here,'' Mr. Morrison said after Mr. Weicker's presentation. ''Lowell Weicker knows about negative campaigning.''
Beyond their attacks on one another, however, all three men spoke of the economic pain that Connecticut residents are feeling, with each candidate arguing that he was best qualified to find the solutions.
Mr. Weicker spoke of the ''economic winter'' that the state is entering, Mr. Rowland talked of the ''misery'' and Mr. Morrison repeatedly emphasized the burdens that working-class families have been forced to bear.
The debate, which was held here in a 1920's-vintage vaudeville theater before 1,500 people, was repeatedly interrupted by applause, cheers and occasional boos, despite the repeated warnings of the moderator.
The election is Nov. 6.

HEADLINE: Democrats Raise Senate Funds

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK

 BODY:
Democratic candidates for the State Senate, who believe money is the chief variable in their quest to reverse the Republican Senate majority, raised an estimated $175,000 last night with some help from Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
The proceeds from the $500-per-person reception at the Sheraton Centre Hotel in Manhattan fell short of the $250,000 that officials of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee had hoped they might collect through Mr. Cuomo's fund-raising operation.
John A. Marino, the chairman of the state Democratic Party, said the Senate committee had been too optimistic in its assessment of the Governor's fund-raising clout. ''This is a very difficult fund-raising climate,'' he said, noting the state's economic condition and the difficulty of persuading contributors to give to a minority party. 
Although Mr. Cuomo has been criticized in past years for not campaigning aggressively for his party's legislative candidates, he has kept an active political schedule this summer and fall. The Governor has argued forcefully that voters should give the Democrats a chance to control all the levers of state government.
 
Republicans Raise More
But Senator Anthony M. Masiello of Buffalo, the chairman of the Democratic Senate Campaign Committee, said money is needed to convey the Governor's message. By mid-July, the most recent date for filing campaign financial statements, the Republican campaign committee had raised five times more than the Democrats.
Mr. Cuomo said last night that hard work and the right positions on the issues could overcome the Republican financial advantage. He said that a unified Democratic government would be quick to pass legislation to institute campaign finance reforms, ban assault weapons, divest state investments in companies doing business in South Africa, create a penalty of life in prison without parole for murderers, and establish a new category of crime for bias-related violence.
The Democrats control the Assembly. But the Republicans, who hold a 32-to-26 majority in the 61-seat Senate, have blocked each of those bills in recent years. Three seats in the Senate are vacant.
Mr. Cuomo, who also faces re-election this year, said the Democrats have not simultaneously controlled the Senate, the Assembly and the Governor's office for 55 years.
''Give us the first chance since 1935 to show what we can do,'' he said. ''And if you don't like us in two years, throw us out.''

 BODY:

War and Cleavage
 ''We may be going to war; it's not the time for decollete,'' said Alexander Liberman, the editorial director of Conde Nast magazines, at a recent cover meeting.
His statement on war and cleavage, which has since been passed on to several editors of Conde Nast magazines, seems to sum up the current fashion mood - if you don't think about it too much.
 
Lean Inventories
 Retailers and fashion houses are in a survival mode, with many executives privately using the word ''depression'' instead of recession to describe the outlook. Publicly, the operative retail term is ''lean inventory.'' 
Weak sales combined with big inventory add up to a retail double whammy. Does lean inventory mean that there will be less merchandise to choose from? Fewer styles and fewer sizes in each style?
''Actually, it's something we say to impress the banks,'' said the senior merchandise manager for a large retailer. ''C.E.O.'s know it is something their lenders want to hear. Retailers pay interest on inventory.''
In a fiercely competitive market, retail executives said they preferred to order from fewer suppliers rather than cut back on sizes and styles.
Some stores, of course, have less merchandise in stock because of credit problems. Instead of receiving truckloads of goods, they're being shipped with an eyedropper.
 
Business With Legs
 One bright spot in fashion retailing has been hosiery, which on the main floors of New York stores seems to be gobbling up more and more space.
''The hosiery business is very good,'' said Kalman Ruttenstein, the fashion director of Bloomingdale's.
''It's leading the accessories pack. There's a lot happening because of patterned and Pucci-style legs.''
With short skirts in vogue, hosiery is no longer just a replacement business, with people buying only to replace worn garments. It's now a fashion business - and an inexpensive way to refresh a wardrobe.
 
Urban Outfitters
Urban Outfitters, a sportswear company, is negotiating for the site of the former Fiorucci store on 59th Street between Park and Lexington Avenues, industry sources said, although no lease has been signed.
Urban Outfitters, which has two Manhattan stores, makes and markets contemporary clothes. While the company's clothes are preppier, it has the sort of eclectic mix and kinetic presentation that once characterized Fiorucci.
 
A New Fendi Bag
In a case of fashion adapting in a very specific way to economic conditions, Fendi, the Italian fashion house, has just introduced a multiple-wallet bag with four compartments for foreign currencies.
It is, Fendi executives said, convenient for people who travel a lot, like fashion editors, who can switch back and forth and take advantage of fluctuating currencies.
For example, if you had held onto British pounds, French francs and Italian lira in the last year, you would be ahead of the game now, given the dollar's decline. At $170, you could tell yourself, the bag would probably pay for itself in a few seasons.
 
Fashion in Tokyo
This year the annual Tokyo ''fashion summit,'' sponsored by the Japanese Government and various corporations, will celebrate the work of four designers: Christian Lacroix of representing France, Franco Moschino of Italy, Vivienne Westwood of Britain and Isaac Mizrahi of the United States.
Of the four designers, who will hold fashion shows and make personal appearances the first week in December, Mr. Mizrahi and Ms. Westwood stand to gain the most. Neither have businesses yet in Japan.

HEADLINE: Strawberry Says Door's Still Ajar for Mets

BYLINE: By JOSEPH DURSO; Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PITTSBURGH, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Darryl Strawberry criticized the Mets' management and some of his teammates today, but he nonetheless seemed to be softening his attitude about leaving the team as a free agent this month. ''I'm not in any hurry to make the decision,'' he said. ''But I'd listen to the Mets first.''
The Mets admitted meanwhile that they were on the brink of losing another prominent member of the cast. Joe McIlvaine, their vice president for baseball operations, was expected to be named general manager of the San Diego Padres on Tuesday with a five-year contract, removing one of the chief architects of the Mets' team of the 1980's. ''We don't want to step on their announcement,'' said Al Harazin, senior vice president of the Mets. ''But it's a fait accompli.'' 
The winds of change blew across the Mets' locker room here at Three Rivers Stadium as they arrived for the season's final series against the Pirates, who beat out the Mets as champions as the National League's East on Sunday. This was the day after, and the Mets seemed down but not despondent. In fact, they rose up and smote the Pirates, 4-1, before 51,393 fans as David Cone pitched a three-hitter with 12 strikeouts that ran his season total to 233, best in he league. 2 Hits for Magadan The Mets started a lineup of mostly irregulars and rookies, but Dave Magadan stayed in pursuit of the league's batting championship with a single and a double in five times at bat. His average stayed at .330, still 5 points behind Willie McGee.
As for Strawberry, the 28-year-old power hitter from Los Angeles stood in the debris of the team's losing season and said that he was not closing the door to staying with the Mets, even though he had said at various times recently that he did not expect to return. He also acknowledged that he talked three days ago with Frank Cashen, the Mets' general manager, and implied that Cashen had apologized for offending Strawberry by suggesting that no baseball player was worth $5 million a year.
''With me, it's not a big money issue,'' Strawberry said. ''It's winning. This team should win, I don't want to be good; I want to be great. Maybe this team got too comfortable and laid-back. The hearts didn't beat fast enough. Some guys around here thought more about their stats all the time. I want to be with a bunch of guys who want to be winners. And the front office has got to go out and change things, change people's attitudes, communicate better and go get some free agents, too.''
He was reminded that he had been hinting lately that he would make a final statement, perhaps even a farewell statement, when the season ends Wednesday. He smiled and said: ''I was going to make a statement, but I decided not to. I just want to walk away with my head high and leave the door open.''
Pressed on whether he was committed to leaving the Mets after eight seasons, he said: ''If I leave, the best thing that ever happened to me was starting my career in New York. The worst thing would be leaving New York.''
Cashen conceded that he had ''talked for about 15 minutes'' with Strawberry, partly about the Mets' ball club on the field, but ''mostly about whether his son should bat right-handed or become a switch-hitter.''
 
Looking at Attitudes
Strawberry made his latest statement about his future in a rambling conversation before the game, in which he did not play, and he placed the emphasis on attitudes rather than economics. He is making $1.8 million this year as he closes a six-year contract, and he was angered when the Mets offered him a new one for three years at $3 million a year. Since July, there have been no negotiations.
''Could I stay with the Mets?'' he reflected today. ''I don't know. It's not money. It's a winning attitude. It's communications. You've got to have some type of relationship. So far this year, it's not been there. I went about my business this summer, trying to play in the pennant race. But every time I looked up, they were talking about me, Cashen and McIlvaine. But I can't do it by myself on this team.''
''I'd like to see what's out there, yes,'' he continued. ''If I got a five-year deal from the Dodgers, that's where I'd like to go. They have a winning attitude. But I'll listen to what the Mets have to say. I'd listen to the Mets first.''
Strawberry, who left the lineup with back spasms last Thursday in Montreal, said he would not play again this season.

The Trade in Toxic Wastes

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
The United States has found a way to rid itself of toxic wastes. That's the good news from tonight's episode of ''Frontline.'' The bad news is for the people of the countries, most of them in the third world, to which the stuff is being exported. ''Global Dumping Ground,'' at 9 P.M. on Channels 13 and 49, reports on the international trade in poisonous materials. It is likely to leave viewers with a bad taste. 
The problem, as Bill Moyers lays it out, begins in the United States, which produces much more than its share of industrial waste and also has the world's strictest laws for disposing of it. Instead of paying the high cost of safe disposal, many companies and state and local governments make deals for their noxious wastes, old chemicals, banned pesticides and all sorts of scrap with middlemen who in turn ship it to foreign countries. The business is not exactly illegal. As one of the most successful former waste exporters, Charles Colbert, says in a surprisingly engaging interview, the laws are not clear. He calls himself a pioneer in ''the surplus chemical business.'' Charles Colbert and his brother, Jack, who did more than half their highly profitable trade with government agencies, were speaking from Federal prison. Their crime lay not in exporting the waste but in mislabeling it and storing it dangerously.
Much of tonight's illuminating program, which was produced by the Center for Investigative Reporting and KQED, the San Francisco public station, focuses on Taiwan, China and Mexico, all of which have been on the receiving end of America's wastes.
Taiwan, which has neither its own supply of minerals nor strict environmental regulations, has nourished its economic boom with lead from discarded car batteries and other scrap, much of it highly dangerous. Until a recent crackdown, people in the vicinity of recycling plants have been finding everything from lead oxide to PCB's to asbestos in their air and water.
An official of the United States Environmental Protection Agency tells of pressure by the Commerce Department, keepers of the Federal budget and foreign trade officials against a ban on such exports, since they serve the interests of American companies. Moreover, some third-world countries find the deals too profitable to resist.
For example, one middleman, having worn out his welcome in Taiwan, has moved to China. He, too, calls himself a pioneer. Taking the camera on a proud tour of his big operation, he boasts that he pays less than $2 a day to the workers who recycle scrap. The Chinese Government, evidently grateful for the dollars and for the salvaged materials, seems indifferent to the costs in pollution.
Cheap labor and weakly enforced regulations have also made Mexico a major repository of wastes from the north. A Los Angeles prosecutor says that for the dumpers, ''Mexico is just a big trash can.'' Such is the volume of traffic over the California-Mexico border that United States customs agents cannot begin to catch shippers of dangerous materials.
Tonight's program, plainly aimed at stirring public indignation and pressure for stricter regulation, does its job effectively. The picture you may take away is of small children in Tijuana splashing in a basin of water that has probably been polluted by the least savory made-in-America exports.

Prices of precious metals plunged, with gold down $16 an ounce and silver falling to its lowest level since 1982. [D22.] The dollar fell in reaction to the budget package. [D22.]
 
THE ECONOMY
 
A measure to cut the amount of commercials on children's TV shows was approved by the House. The Senate passed the bill last week, but President Bush has expressed reservations about it. [A1.]
 
A bill broadening the S.E.C.'s punitive powers passed the House. [D1.]
 
A tax issue crucial to savings institutions will be considered by the Supreme Court. [D1.]

HEADLINE: Court to Rule on I.R.S. Ban On Paper Losses by S.& L.'s

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether the Internal Revenue Code permits savings and loan institutions to create paper losses for Federal income tax purposes by swapping their portfolios of low-value mortgages for similar portfolios owned by other institutions.
The practice of ''reciprocal sales,'' as these mortgage exchanges are known, is widespread among savings and loan institutions, and has resulted in billions of dollars of losses being reported to the I.R.S. since it was sanctioned in a 1980 Federal Home Loan Bank Board memorandum.
The exchanges were attractive to savings and loan associations saddled with long-term home mortgage loans at fixed, low-interest rates in the 1980's when interest rates were rising sharply, causing the value of loan portfolios to plunge.
Savings and loan associations typically claimed tax losses on their portfolios' reduced value by engaging in reciprocal transactions. One institution sold its loans to another institution and bought the second institution's substantially identical package of depreciated mortgages. After the transactions, the institutions would then claim the difference between the face value of the mortgages and the lower, market value as a tax loss. 
Under the bank board's Memorandum R-49, the savings institutions did not have to report the loss for regulatory accounting purposes, meaning that there was no effect on minimum reserve and liquidity requirements.
The Internal Revenue Service, however, has refused to recognize these losses, finding that because the participants' economic reality has not changed, no deductible loss is created in the transaction. Federal courts have been divided on whether the I.R.S. interpretation is correct.
Returning today from its summer recess, the Supreme Court agreed at the Government's request to resolve the question. According to the Internal Revenue Service, there is now some $419 million in disputed tax liability, not counting interest, at stake in 96 administrative and court cases around the country.
The Justices agreed to hear two of the conflicting cases. In one, U.S. v. Centennial Savings Bank, No. 89-1926, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, in New Orleans, ruled that the Internal Revenue Code permitted the paper losses to be taken. The institution in the case, formerly known as the First Federal Savings and Loan of Greenville, Tex., and now in Federal receivership, claimed a $2.8 million loss on its 1981 tax return for the reciprocal sale of a mortgage portfolio with the Federal National Mortgage Association. The face value of both portfolios was $8.5 million, and the institutions paid each other $5.7 million.
In the second case, Cottage Savings Association v. I.R.S., No. 89-1965, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in Cincinatti, took the opposite approach, upholding the I.R.S.'s disallowance of the losses claimed by the Ohio savings and loan in a similar transaction.
The Supreme Court also agreed to hear several other business-related cases today, including these: Jurisdiction In a case that could prove important to many businesses that solicit customers across state lines, the Court agreed to decide whether a company that does not do business in a state, but directs advertising to the state or pays commissions to agents there, can be sued in that state.
The case, Carnival Cruise Lines v. Shute, No. 89-1647, is an appeal by the Miami-based cruise company from a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in California. One of Carnival's passengers, a resident of the state of Washington, was injured on a cruise off the coast of Mexico. She sued for negligence in the Federal District Court in the state of Washington, which dismissed the suit on the ground that Carnival's contacts with the state were insufficient to give jurisdiction to courts there. But the appeals court reinstated the suit, ruling that if Carnival had not advertised its cruise in Washington, the passenger would not have been on the cruise.
 
Phone Book Copyright
The Court agreed to decide whether Federal copyright law permitted a telephone company to copyright the lists of names and addresses contained in its white pages.
While it is clear that the law gives some measure of copyright protection to telephone books, the question in this case is whether that protection is limited to the format and arrangement of the book, or whether it extends to its information.
The case, Feist Publications v. Rural Telephone Service Co., No. 89-1909, is an appeal by a private publishing company that competes with a rural Kansas telephone company in the market for telephone books. The United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit, in Denver, upheld a $6,000 judgment for copyright infringement won by the telephone company after Feist put out its own book based on the telephone company's listings. The 10th Circuit said the telephone company's copyright protected the information in the book and not just the format and organization.

HEADLINE: United Thrives Amid Turmoil

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Given the environment in which it has been operating, the UAL Corporation could have become a basket case long ago. As if four takeover bids and three chief executives in four years were not enough, the parent of United Airlines has recently been battered by the rising fuel prices and weakening traffic that have troubled the whole industry.
Yet for all the turmoil, UAL in the last few months has regained from American Airlines its position as the nation's biggest airline, improved its service record and, thanks to its lucrative Pacific routes, remained one of the most profitable domestic carriers.
That success will be tested in coming weeks. A group including United's three unions that has made an accepted offer to buy the airline for $201 a share has until Oct. 9 to line up financing. If, as most analysts expect, the deal collapses, the unions will seek an immediate resumption of talks on new contracts, and the negotiations could be difficult. 
 
Earnings Troubles
What is more, the airline will face more pressure to cut costs because earnings, which reached a record in the second quarter, are expected to drop sharply in the quarter that ended Sept. 30. In the three months ended June 30, the company reported a 5.1 percent increase in net income, to $148.3 million, or $6.81 a share, on revenue of $2.7 billion. But analysts expect that a weak third and fourth quarter will mean that United's earnings for 1990 will be less than half the $324.2 million in 1989.
While no one disputes that United's troubles have already caused their share of turmoil at the $10 billion company with 74,000 employees, people who have followed the carrier say it is extraordinary that an organization under such strain could be so resilient.
''The outlook for United is very promising,'' said John Eichner, a New York-based industry consultant. ''It must be one helluva property if it is doing this well in spite of all of its problems.''
United's 6.5 percent operating margin - operating income relative to revenue - in the second quarter was bested only by American Airlines' 7.8 percent and Southwest Airlines' 13.4 percent. The major reason was the Pacific routes: For example. last year United's operating margins ran at 7.1 percent in the Pacific and 4 percent domestically, estimated Thomas Longman, the airline analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company.
''I am not sure it would be fair to call United the stellar performer in the business,'' Mr. Longman said. ''They just happen to have a nice chunk of their business - roughly 30 percent - in the Pacific.''
United's service to the Pacific, which includes daily flights to Japan, Australia and other points in the Far East, is now the largest in the region, having surpassed that of Japan Air Lines and Northwest Airlines. In 1988, United was flying about 31,000 seats to and from the Pacific each week. The figure now stands at just under 50,000. Northwest flies about 40,000 seats a week and Japan Air Lines 32,000.
 
Takes the Top Spot
Helped by its Pacific routes and service to Europe that was introduced last spring, United has moved slightly ahead of American as the largest United States carrier in terms of miles flown by paying passengers. Each airline holds about 17 percent of the market among domestic carriers.
The airline's improvement in service is evident in several ways: On-time arrivals and departures are up in the last year, and the number of times in a month that United ground crews mishandle baggage is down, according to Transportation Department figures. (These trends are true for the industry as a whole as well.) Analysts say a good part of the credit must go to Stephen M. Wolf, the 49-year-old former chief executive of Republic Airlines and Flying Tiger who became United's chief executive in December 1987, replacing Frank Olson, who in turn replaced Richard Ferris in June 1987. Industry experts say Mr. Wolf has succeeded on a number of fronts.
 
New Team Praised
For one thing, they say, he has assembled what may be the strongest top-management team in the business. Job No. 1 was maintaining the morale of James Guyette, United's longtime head of operations who many industry experts thought would quit when he lost the chairmanship to Mr. Wolf. In addition, Mr. Wolf in 1988 recruited from American Airlines John C. Pope, considered one of the industry's saaviest finance executives, to be United's chief financial officer. And Mr. Wolf promoted Christopher Bowers, another longtime United employee, to the crucial position of head of sales. Industry experts say that United's relations with travel agents have improved markedly under Mr. Bowers.
Also under Mr. Wolf, United's middle management - the thousands of marketing executives, logistics specialists, strategic and financial planners, and ground-crew personnel -has ''focused on the right things,'' said Robert P. Neuschel a longtime student of United who runs the Transportation Center at Northwestern University. He was referring to the airline's improved customer service.
More than anything, Mr. Wolf has undertaken to expand the service to the Far East that United began in 1986, when Mr. Ferris paid $750 million for the Far East business of Pan American World Airways. The Pacific service is highlighted in United's two-year-old advertising campaign, produced by Leo Burnett & Company, set to Gershwin's ''Rhapsody in Blue'' and carrying on the ''Friendly Skies'' theme that the airline has used since the 1960's.
But for all its recent successes, United faces major risks. All three of United's major unions - the pilots, flight attendants and machinists -are working with expired contracts and have agreed to hold off on contract talks until the takeover issue is resolved. But if the union bid for the carrier fails, the employees will seek an immediate resumption of talks. Given Mr. Wolf's tough bargaining position in the past - he has all but said that United's pilots are overpaid - those talks could be protracted and contentious.
 
Some Union Resentment
''There would be distractions, unhappiness and disruptions of all sorts,'' said Rick Dubinsky, the head of United's pilots' union. ''If this deal falls through and you have three unions with open contracts, any thought of this company being a well-run airline under Steven Wolf would be fantasy.''
Indeed, some United employees resent Mr. Wolf for the way he has handled himself in past buyout attempts, arguing that he has been too quick to give up and too quick to seek concessions from workers.
Mr. Wolf, who declined to be interviewed, is not part of the current buyout group and would be replaced by Gerald Greenwald, a former Chrysler vice chairman, if the bid succeeds. But he was a member of the union-management group whose buyout proposal collapsed last October for lack of financing, touching off a steep fall in the stock market. Earlier buyout proposals by the pilots' union (in 1987) and the Los Angeles investor Marvin Davis (in 1989) also failed.
Having presented its $201-a-share bid to United's board, the union group has been given until Oct. 9 to line up financing. The unions, in turn, have given their banks a deadline of this Wednesday to say whether they as lenders will go along with the deal or support a lower bid. And while the board has technically accepted the $201 offer, it could still decide that it does not like the financing terms that the employees ultimately line up, and reject the deal. Skepticism about the deal's being completed is an important reason that United's stock has fallen sharply in recent months. (But since Mr. Davis offered late Thursday to join the employee buyout of the company, the stock has risen by $12.75, to $103.375, on the New York Stock Exchange.) 'No Compelling Reason'
''The key is that there is no compelling reason why United has to be sold,'' said Sharon J. Kalin, a stock trader who has followed United since the first takeover bid emerged in 1987. ''The company is not in a cash squeeze, and there is no raider breathing down its neck.''
Another concern for United is that it has fallen behind in ordering new aircraft. United is taking delivery of one new jet a week, mostly Boeing 737's used on domestic medium-haul flights and 767's that will be used for travel to Europe. But United has told its suppliers it will hold off on ordering new wide-body aircraft for domestic long-haul flights until the airline's future is clearer. That puts United at a competitive disadvantage, because many of its existing long-haul domestic aircraft are DC-10's, which consume more fuel than new models and require larger crews.
Moreover, United's European service is still only a token effort - just three flights a day, to Frankfurt and Paris.
And on its home turf, O'Hare Airport in Chicago, United has begun feeling increasing pressure from American Airlines. American pulled aircraft out of Cleveland to support more flights out of Chicago. American also purchased from Trans World Airlines the rights to fly from Chicago to various European destinations.
Finally, all the disciplined management in the world may not be able to keep United profitable if the hostilities in the Middle East continue to send jet fuel prices higher, and if the economy weakens further.

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Plunge on Hint of Mideast Peace

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Crude oil prices dropped sharply yesterday on the hint of peace.
In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude for delivery next month closed at $37.09 a barrel, down $2.42, one of the steepest one-day drops in recent weeks. Gasoline and heating oil were also sharply lower.
Considering the trading range yesterday, the volume was light, floor brokers said. 
The market opened lower, following the lead set by trading in London. Prices dropped there in response to a speech by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq over the weekend that traders took as conciliatory. Then President Bush, speaking at the United Nations, said, ''We seek a peaceful outcome, a diplomatic outcome,'' and the price went lower still.
''It just looks like there's been some sort of a shift in U.S. policy,'' said Bradford H. Hughes, a trader at Cargill Investor Services Inc. ''It's a change in Bush's attitude; he seems a little more open.'' Mr. Hughes added, ''When Bush made the speech, the bottom fell out of the market.'' The low for the day was $35.85. Market participants did not cite the weekend accord on the Federal budget, which included heavy taxes on gasoline, as a factor yesterday. But some noted that the House of Representatives on Friday voted to allow the sale of 15 million barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
But the market may have been looking for a reason to fall, said David T. Mizrahi, the editor of Mid East Report, an economic newsletter, who said that with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela having made up much of the lost production of Kuwait and Iraq, the price should be in the range of $22 to $23.
''The market was overinflated,'' Mr. Mizrahi said. ''I think we're going back to normal.''
Saddam Hussein, Mr. Mizrahi said, ''is turning more quiet than he used to be, in his statements and his behavior.'' He predicted that the Iraqi leader would make no bellicose statements in the next few days and the price would go still lower.
 
More Instability
At Ashland Oil Inc., an oil refiner based in Ashland, Ky., Cyrus H. Tahmassebi, the chief economist, took yesterday's action as another sign of the market's instability. ''Anything that happens, probably the market overreacts either way, both upward and downward,'' he said. ''If the crisis ends or there's an indication it's going to end without any disruption of oil facilities, this thing is going to come down very quickly.''
Mr. Tahmassebi added that no crude shortage existed, and that the existence of large stockpiles would accelerate any downward move if one began. When oil users believed that prices would not rise, he said, they would start drawing down their stockpiles and stop buying more oil; a shortage of buyers would then drive the price down quickly.
Gasoline fell sharply in price on the Merc yesterday, by 4.8 cents a gallon, the equivalent of more than $2 a barrel, to 93.91 cents. Heating oil was down even more sharply, by 5.89 cents, or nearly $2.50 a barrel, to $1.0003 a gallon.
 
Other Products Down
In oil and products, most of the contracts for more distant months fell by the allowable limit.
Contracts for natural gas futures also fell by 2.6 cents, closing at $1.909 per thousand cubic feet for November delivery. Although natural gas is a substitute for oil, its price has moved little in response to the oil market.
The reason may be that the mix of oil entering this country is changing, with heavier crudes substituting for the lighter ones that once came from Iraq and Kuwait. ''You get less gasoline from the heavier crudes, and more residual oil,'' said Richard D. Dole, an energy expert at Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm.
That has kept the price of residual fuel low, relative to the price of other oil products, Mr. Dole said, and it is residual fuel for which natural gas most often substitutes.

HEADLINE: Regan on S.& L.'s: Too Many Curbs

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Donald T. Regan, an architect of the Reagan Administration's deregulatory policies, told Congress today that contrary to conventional wisdom, the savings and loan debacle resulted from too many restrictions on savings institutions, not too few.
The basic problem, he said, was that these institutions were limited to investments in their regions, which made them ''extremely vulnerable to regional economic troubles.''
Mr. Regan, who served as President Reagan's first Treasury Secretary and then became White House chief of staff, told the House Banking Committee, ''Better regulation and supervision by thrift regulators would not necessarily have prevented what ultimately happened.'' 
Mr. Regan also said that in late 1986 Senator Dennis DeConcini, the Arizona Democrat, had lobbied him for a Government appointment for Lee Henkel Jr. of Georgia, a business associate of Charles H. Keating Jr., the Phoenix financier who built and lost the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association.
''Senator DeConcini called me several times when I was chief of staff,'' Mr. Regan said. He added that Senator Mack Mattingly, Republican of Georgia, also supported the appointment of Mr. Henkel, a Georgia constituent.
Mr. DeConcini had urged Mr. Henkel's appointment to a seat on the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, Mr. Regan recalled. Mr. Henkel won the appointment, but resigned after public disclosure of his business dealings with Mr. Keating. Mr. DeConcini, the recipient of campaign contributions from Mr. Keating, is among three Senators being investigated by the Senate Ethics Committee.
Asked to comment, Bob Maynes, Mr. DeConcini's press secretary, disputed Mr. Regan's recollection. ''There were no phone conversations, but a letter to Mr. Regan,'' Mr. Maynes said.
 
Some on Panel Skeptical
Mr. Regan's defense of deregulation drew skepticism from some committee members. Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, Texas Democrat and chairman of the Banking Committee, told Mr. Regan, ''It is obvious that the Reagan Administration put much faith in a deregulatory policy which handed the savings and loan industry new powers and a greater array of permissible investments for insured deposits, policies which the highfliers interpreted as a green light for risky ventures that are now costing the taxpayers so heavily.''
Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, said, ''It might be argued that the greatest damage was done in the bowels of the regulatory agencies, where ideologues labored like termites to bring down the regulatory structure.''
But Mr. Regan insisted that deregulation was not the cause of the failure of savings and loans, which is expected to cost taxpayers $500 billion. That failure became ''almost inevitable when banks and thrifts are encouraged to carry on their activities in a relatively small geographic area, and the economy of that area suffers a devastating collapse,'' Mr. Regan said.
 
Staffs Called Sufficient
Nor did the regulators suffer from reductions in their staffs, Mr. Regan said. ''Regulators, like generals, never have enough troops,'' Mr. Regan said. Even under optimum conditions, regulators could not examine and supervise all institutions, he told the committee. The regulators should have focused on the troubled institutions and the fast-growing savings and loans.
The root causes of the debacle, Mr. Regan said, were restrictions that ''limited the ability of U.S. banks to diversify their loans outside their localities and made them extremely vulnerable to regional economic troubles.''

HEADLINE: Tokyo Stocks Up By 13.24%

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Tokyo stocks posted their biggest single-day gains today, with the key Nikkei index up 13.24 percent The 225-stock average almost regained the nearly 15 percent it had lost over the previous five trading days.
Brokers said Wall Street's gains on Monday, lower oil prices, and the perception that tensions are easing in the Persian Gulf all contributed to the rebound.
In the United States, stocks advanced sharply on Monday in heavy trading in the wake of Congressional action to rein in the budget. Also helping were a surprise, if less than conciliatory, call from President Saddam Hussein of Iraq for talks on the Persian Gulf crisis and President Bush's optimistic remarks on a diplomatic solution. 
The Dow jumped 63.36 points, or 2.6 percent, to 2,515.84, for its biggest gain in more than four months.
The Nikkei was up 2676.55 points to 22,898.41, after falling 761.64 on Monday. Today's advance topped the Nikkei's previous best performance on Oct. 21, 1987, when it gained 2,037.32 points, or 9.3 percent. The Nikkei has spent most of the year sliding downward from a peak of 38,915.87 at the end of last year.
The Tokyo market was also encouraged by measures taken by the Finance Ministry.
Traders said investors were clammoring to buy blue chips such as Toyota Motors, Hitachi Electric and Matsushita Electric. The rally spilled over to other sectors, they said.
''The environment is extremely good today. And market participants have all been putting in buy orders,'' said Naoki Ohno, manager of the investment advisory department at Daiwa Securities.
Dealers said buyers rushed into the market following the strong rally in New York and the supportive measures announced by Finance Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto after Monday's plunge.
Following the Nikkei's brief drop below 20,000 points Monday, its lowest level in 3 1/2 years, Mr. Hashimoto decided to approve more liberal margin trading regulations. Mr. Hashimoto included steps to raise the maximum rate for valuing stocks used as collateral for margin trading. The Finance Ministry also shortened trading hours for futures and options.
''The support from the Finance Ministry boosted the market's sentiment. I believe institutional investors as well as individual buyers now can't resist investing at the current low levels,'' said Toshiyuki Nishiguchi, a trader with Daiwa.
 
Program Trading
In New York, program trading was strong for most of the day, Birinyi Associates said, with waves of computerized buying lifting the Dow Jones industrial average nearly 50 points.
Shortly after noon the New York Stock Exchange intervened, prohibiting program traders from buying on an uptick because the Dow had climbed more than 50 points.
The broader Standard & Poor's index of the top 500 Big Board stocks spurted close to 3 percent, rising 8.89, to 314.94.
Smaller stocks, as measured by the Nasdaq composite index, also turned sharply upward, climbing 10.14, to 354.65, also ahead almost 3 percent.
Despite the big jump in stocks, economists were divided on how Wall Street responded to the budget accord.
''While not great,'' said David B. Bostian Jr., chief economist for Jesup, Josephthal & Company, ''and disappointing because it did not have a capital gains tax reduction, it still is positive in the sense that at the last moment Congress was able to function and produce an agreement.
''Nonetheless, the financial markets appeared to interpret it favorably.''
''The budget package is not all that good,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist for the Norwest Corporation of Minneapolis. ''I'm somewhat disappointed. The general consensus in the financial markets is that this is not enough.''
 
Stock Market Pessimists
Stock market pessimists who had sold short were forced to buy back stock they had hoped to buy later for less money, consequently pushing prices higher.
Trading activity, which soared to 201 million shares on Friday, rose to 202.2 million yesterday, giving investors courage that maybe new buyers were coming into what had been a thoroughly discouraged investment world.
In a sign that the tide may have turned, 1,203 stocks advanced while only 442 declined. Even so, in a strong indication that many investors continued to focus on the weak economy, 125 stocks touched new lows for the year and only four hit new highs.
Traders voiced relief over the strong upturn.
''It came in the nick of time,'' one remarked. ''It takes off a lot of pressure and gives you hope.''
Wall Street seemed divided on what happens next. Bond prices picked up significantly, pushing down yields on long-term Treasuries to 8.85 percent. Gold fell $16.50 on the Iraqi news to $391.70 an ounce, instantly depressing gold shares. Crude oil, which flirted with $40 a barrel last week, sank $2.42, to $37.09, dragging down oil-service stocks and a few oil shares.
Elaine Garzarelli, a Shearson Lehman Brothers market analyst who forecast the 1987 market crash, urged clients yesterday to get into the stock market.
Arguing that interest rates had dropped in the last week and stocks were cheaper in the last two weeks, she maintained that stocks could rally ''10 to 12 percent from now on.''
''The market anticipates,'' Ms. Garzarelli said. ''Historically, over the last 50 years, the stock market will begin to rally two quarters before the economy bottoms out. We're only two quarters away from the bottom of the economy.''
Robert G. Freedman, chief portfolio manager for John Hancock's mutual funds, seemed skeptical. ''The market's been tremendously oversold,'' he said, ''and there's been so much bearish sentiment, we were ready for a rally. But whether it's a rally in a bear market or is ready to move up, is too early to tell.''
Among the 30 Dow blue chips, all but four advanced. Allied Signal, with huge aerospace operations, remained unchanged at 27 7/8. Chevron fell 3/8, to 73 5/8; Texaco 7/8, to 60 3/8, and Primerica, the financial services company, 3/4, to 19 3/4. A.T.& T. gained 1 3/8, to 32 1/4; Kodak 1 1/8, to 39 5/8; International Paper 1 7/8, to 45 3/8; Coca-Cola 2 1/8, to 41 5/8; Boeing 2 5/8, to 44 1/4; General Electric 1 3/4, to 56 1/4; I.B.M. 2 5/8, to 109, and Merck 4 1/8, to 80 1/4.
In addition to the 1 3/8 rise in A.T.& T., shareowners who kept their Bell stock after the 1984 divestiture fared extremely well yesterday -with all seven rising significantly. Ameritech rose 2 7/8, to 63 7/8; Bell Atlantic 1 7/8, to 49 1/8; BellSouth 1 5/8, to 54; Nynex 1 1/2, to 71 3/4; Pacific Telesis 1 3/4, to 46; Southwestern 3, to 55 3/8, and U S West 1 3/8, to 36 1/4.

HEADLINE: Talking Business with Sir Derek Birkin of RTZ;
Uncertainty Seen In Metal Markets

BYLINE: By Steve Lohr

 BODY:
The mining and metal industry is even more closely tied than most businesses to general economic trends. Its products tend to be priced daily by commodity traders around the world and, from aluminum to zircon, metals are used to make all manner of industrial goods.
The RTZ Corporation, based in London, is one of the largest mining companies and mineral producers in the world. With mines in 40 countries, RTZ is a major producer of copper, aluminum and gold, as well as industrial minerals such as borax and titanium dioxide. Last year, the company earned $1.1 billion on sales of $7.8 billion. 
Sir Derek Birkin, chief executive of RTZ, discussed the industry, its outlook and his company:
 
Q. Are you seeing a recession yet in the demand for metals and minerals?
 
A. By and large, demand in the metal markets is holding up pretty well. But there have been signs of uncertainty and leveling off recently. And the picture varies considerably region by region. In Southeast Asia and Japan, demand is still strong. In the United States, it is flat or down. In Europe, demand in Britain is down but up in most other countries. However, over the next several months, we do expect demand to level off for all industrial metals.
 
Q. Since mid-June, the price of gold has gone from about $340 an ounce to roughly $400, mainly due to the turmoil in the Middle East.
Last year, your company produced 864,000 ounces of gold and analysts estimate that a $50-an-ounce rise in gold prices adds about $30 million to RTZ's earnings. What do you expect to happen to gold prices through, say, the middle of next year?
 
A. Gold has come up very well. And that has been despite big sales by the Soviets in the immediate aftermath of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. We expect gold prices to move within a range of $375 to $450 an ounce. When the price moves toward the upper end of that range, you run into selling by producers, as we saw from the South Africans when the price touched $415 an ounce not long ago. Of course, a big upset in the Middle East could cause a breakout in the price, above and beyond the $375-to-$450 range we anticipate.
 
Q. Mining has traditionally been a notoriously cyclical business. What can a company do to maintain profitability despite the swings in the business cycle and metal markets?
 
A. Two things. First, you can diversify your portfolio of metals and minerals produced and the geographic spread of those operations. That tends to buffer you from the particular problems of a country or an industry. If you're on a narrow product base, you are a slave to certain metal price cycles and we're determined not to be that. The second thing is to steadily make capital investments to drive down costs. A low-cost producer will make money even in weak markets. Those two objectives have been fundamental to our philosophy at RTZ.
 
Q. Last year, you paid $3.7 billion for BP Minerals, the mining and mineral operations of British Petroleum. Why was it worth that and how does it fit into your plans?
 
A. It gave us a world-class size in gold mining and low-cost copper production and built up our portfolio of industrial minerals as well. The acquisition also greatly increased our business in North America, so you have that increased production in politically stable nations. BP Minerals included such properties as the Kennecott copper and gold mine in Bingham Canyon, Utah, and QIT's titanium feedstock operation in Canada. The BP Minerals purchase took the North American contribution to our business in terms of revenues and profits from about one-third to more than a half.
 
Q. With the global economy slowing down and many metal prices likely to weaken, are your capital spending plans being trimmed?
 
A. No. Our normal capital expenditures are running at about $1 billion a year and that will not be cut back. You can't finesse the metal cycles. Oftentimes, opportunities come at the low point of the price cycle, but you simply have to get on with it.
 
Q. How concerned are you that metal prices will slide?
 
A. We're not too worried. As I said before, demand is still holding up reasonably well. And some price instability is not necessarily a bad thing. It keeps unwise and foolish investment out of the business.

Smurfit Plans to Build Paper Recycling Mill

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
Plans for a mill in upstate New York that would recycle the equivalent of nearly 25 percent of the newspaper printed in the state have been announced by the Jefferson Smurfit Corporation of St. Louis, the nation's largest producer of recycled newsprint.
The mill would recycle 330,000 tons of waste paper from across the Northeast, including the New York City area, into 250,000 tons of newsprint at a location yet to be decided.
The announcement of an agreement to build the plant was made last week by the company and state economic development officials. 
Newspaper publishers in the state have pledged to increase their use of recycled paper to 40 percent by the year 2000 from the current level of about 7 percent. Because of a shortage of recycling capacity, supplies of old newspapers have piled up and little additional recycled paper has been available. The only newsprint recyling mill in the Northeast is in Garfield, N.J.
A spokesman for Smurfit, a subsidiary of the Jefferson Smurfit Group P.L.C. of Dublin, said the mill would take three to four years to complete once a site is announced later this year. The plant will cost about $400 million and employ about 200 people.
Smurfit was one of two organizations that had expressed interest in building a newsprint recycling plant in the Northeast. The other company, the Garden State Paper Company, is being sold by its parent, Media General Inc. Garden State operates the recycling mill in Garfield.
Old newspapers are recycled by reducing them to fibers in a large vat of water and removing the ink with detergents and other chemicals. The cleaned fibers are reconstituted into paper on a large machine that removes the excess water.
J. Rodney Edwards, a vice president of the American Paper Institute, said the glut of old newspapers that existed in 1989 has eased this year, largely because some planned collection systems did not start. He said the mill should stimulate demand.
''This will add a major element of certainty to the newspaper market,'' said John Ruston, a solid waste specialist with the Environmental Defense Fund. ''Once the mill is built and running, it will be hungry for newspapers.''

HEADLINE: Construction Spending Unchanged in August

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 1

 BODY:
Construction spending stalled in August after posting its first gain in four months in July, the Government said today. Only an increase in Government projects kept overall construction spending from declining.
''Confidence is the major problem we have across the board right now,'' said Darryl Delano, an economist with Cahners Economics in Newton, Mass. ''Confidence is certainly at the lowest point we've seen in a long time.'' 
In addition to consumer caution over the state of the economy and the Persian Gulf crisis, analysts have attributed the general weakness in the construction industry to high interest rates, tight lending requirements, and, in some areas, overbuilding resulting in high vacancies.
The Commerce Department said residential, nonresidential and government spending was virtually unchanged at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $442.5 billion following a revised three-tenths of 1 percent increase in July.
The often volatile government spending category jumped 6.1 percent, offsetting declines of 1.2 percent in residential construction and 4.3 percent in nonresidential outlays.
 
Residential Sector 'Very Weak'
''The residential sector was very weak,'' Mr. Delano said of the $186.9 billion spending rate for single-family and multifamily buildings. ''It's consistent with everything we've seen in that sector.''
Residential spending has fallen for five straight months.
Single-family spending was down 1.3 percent, to an annual rate of $108.5 billion, after a 1.2 percent loss a month earlier. Apartment construction was up 1.1 percent, to $19 billion, after a five-tenths of 1 percent gain in July.
Nonresidential spending, which advanced 4.2 percent in July, fell 4.3 percent, to annual rate of $104.8 billion in August, and more than erased the gain. Industrial spending, which jumped 16.2 percent in July, slipped back 12.7 percent.
''There's a lot more weakness to come,'' Mr. Delano said. ''It's consistent with a lack of confidence and a wait-and-see attitude.''
 
Highway Spending Increases
Government spending totaled an annual rate of $115.1 billion following a 2.7 percent decline the previous month. Spending on highways and streets led the advance with a 9 percent gain.
The three-tenths of 1 percent increase in construction spending in July was the first advance since a four-tenths of 1 percent gain in March. Spending fell 2.8 percent in April, two-tenths of 1 percent in May and six-tenths of 1 percent in June.
The weakness has been illustrated in recent Labor Department reports showing the loss of nearly 100,000 construction jobs in the last three months. This included 40,000 jobs, after a seasonal adjustment, in August, the sixth consecutive monthly decline.
Construction spending in August rose 2 percent from the August 1989 level of $433.9 billion.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Golden Nugget's Bet on Boxing

BYLINE: By Leslie Wayne

 BODY:
WHEN the heavyweight champion, Buster Douglas, defends his title against Evander Holyfield on Oct. 25 in Las Vegas, one of the biggest bettors will be Golden Nugget Inc., the hotel casino owner that is the fight's sponsor.
Analysts say the fight could add anywhere from 25 cents to 50 cents a share to Golden Nugget's earnings. Or it could be a money loser for a company whose stock, like most gambling issues, has taken a beating in the market lately.
The only certain winner financially will be Mr. Douglas, who, as champion, will take home $24 million regardless of whether he triumphs in the ring. For Golden Nugget, it is a riskier proposition. Golden Nugget is hoping the fight will be a drawing card for the Mirage, the splashy and expensive hotel and casino that the company opened last year on the Las Vegas Strip with much fanfare from its chairman, Stephen A. Wynn. The Mirage, which cost $630 million, has been an unbridled success so far, with occupancy of its 3,056 rooms in the upper 90 percent range. 
Its theme park atmosphere, with an exploding volcano, light-drenched waterfalls, dolphin pools and white tigers on parade in its lobbies, is rewriting the rules for casino showmanship. And it is luring high rollers from well-entrenched rivals like the Flamingo, Caesars Palace and the Hilton.
Though the initial success is unquestioned, analysts are now asking: Can it be sustained? And that is where Mr. Douglas and Mr. Holyfield come in. The purpose of the fight is twofold: first, to attract enough people to the Mirage to cover the fight's $35 million cost and turn a profit as well and, second, to add to the long-term value of the Mirage as the ''happening'' place for gamblers.
High rollers are attracted by prize fights, so casinos pay dearly for them. Alan M. Feldman, a Golden Nugget spokesman, said the fight itself was a break-even proposition; the real question was how much would be left on the gambling tables. The $35 million the Golden Nugget pays to the boxers and their promoters is recouped immediately through sales to cable television ($16 million); closed-circuit television ($3 million); foreign television ($4 million); gate tickets ($11 million), and merchandising agreements.
The real money, however, comes from the casino. On fight night, $5 minimum tables become $50 tables. The hotel is sold out the entire week of the fight. Last December, on the three days surrounding the Sugar Ray Leonard-Roberto Duran middleweight fight at the Mirage, the ''drop,'' or the amount wagered at the tables, was around $70 million - a record. About 20 percent of the drop is kept by the casino as its ''win.''
Mr. Feldman estimates the Oct. 25 fight could bring in even more because heavyweight fights generally attract a bigger and richer crowd. But making a precise calculation is tough because it is hard to determine how much gamblers will gamble. Even harder to foresee is how much they will win, the ''luck'' element. If luck is running against the house on the nights surrounding the fight -Golden Nugget's profits will suffer.
''The fight could add as much as 50 cents a share if the house runs lucky, or it could be a negative of as much as 25 cents a share,'' said Lee Isgur, a Paine Webber analyst. ''It depends on how the tables run.''
Last year, because of the start-up costs of the Mirage, Golden Nugget lost $27 million on revenues of about $300 million, but it has made money so far this year. The company owns another casino in Las Vegas, one in Laughlin, Nev., and 14.5 acres of land in Atlantic City.
Analysts are split on the outlook for the company. Mark Manson, with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, considers the company ''unattractive'' because he doubts that the early operating results at the Mirage are sustainable in the face of an economic downturn. The company's heavy debt, $900 million, also worries him.
James J. Murren, an analyst with C. J. Lawrence, has a ''hold'' on Golden Nugget, fearing the effects of existing overcapacity in Las Vegas and an impending recession.
But Michael G. Mueller, with Montgomery Securities, recommends the stock, anticipating that Golden Nugget will earn $3 a share this year.
Mr. Isgur of Paine Webber also recommends the stock, which closed yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange at $20.75 a share, up $1.625. He feels the Mirage is unique and will continue to draw crowds. ''It's the only game of its kind in town and nothing else like it is under construction,'' Mr. Isgur said. ''I have no doubt they can sustain their success. Anyone with doubts should fly out and take a look. No one who's been there has doubts anymore.''

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Rates Fall as Fed Becomes Focus

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Long-term interest rates fell sharply and Treasury bond prices rose yesterday, in reaction to several positive developments, including the 11-hour agreement to cut the Federal budget deficit announced on Sunday.
The rate decline yesterday, which took yields on the 30-year Treasury bond to 8.84 percent, their lowest level since mid-August, continued a rally that began last week.
The Federal Reserve Board's policy-making Open Market Committee is to meet in Washington today, and the drop in rates would appear to place additional pressure on the panel to approve a cut in the overnight rate for bank loans in the Federal funds market, the short-term rate the Fed most closely controls.
 
Ball in Fed's Court
Since early summer, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has taken every possible opportunity to reassure Congress that if a ''credible'' budget package were favorably received in the credit markets, the central bank would respond by allowing the Federal funds rate to fall. 
Although much remains to be done before a final budget is passed, the emergence of a package that must be taken seriously on Capitol Hill appears to mark the start of the sequence of events outlined by Mr. Greenspan.
Credit market participants said yesterday that much of the decline in long-term rates last week was in anticipation of the budget deal announced on Sunday.
Now, it would seem, it is the Fed's turn to act. But most credit market analysts said yesterday that policy makers were not likely to approve any change in monetary policy until the budget process was completed. They said, moreover, that the magnitude of the Fed's reward, once it came, was almost certain to disappoint Congress and the Bush Administration.
 
A 'Bias' Is Expected
''The Fed will come out of this meeting with a bias toward easing policy, but they will not take that step until they see if the budget proposal is actually implemented, '' said Darwin L. Beck, an economist at the First Boston Corporation.
''And the most you can expect is maybe a 25-basis-point reduction in the Federal funds rate. I don't think the Fed has promised a major easing of policy on something less than $40 billion in budget cuts.''
Joseph R. Liro, a vice president and money market economist at S. G. Warburg Securities Inc., noted that ''passage of the budget has been promised by Oct. 19.'' He added: ''The economy is not going to live or die between now and then if the Fed doesn't move. The budget chiefs are on board, but the Fed needs to see that the Indians go along with it.''
One factor that may speed up the Fed's timing, analysts said, would be additional evidence that the economy is sliding closer to recession.
Such evidence was released yesterday, when a survey of purchasing managers showed that during September the condition of the manufacturing sector sank to its lowest level since December 1982.
 
Jobs Data More Important
The survey is closely followed by Fed governors, but private analysts still said only a very weak report on employment conditions during September might prompt the Fed to ease monetary policy before the budget accord was ratified. The employment data are scheduled to be released on Friday.
''Friday will be the most important number, but every indication so far is that things are getting pretty grim,'' said Susan M. Hering, an economist at Salomon Brothers Inc.
''We are meeting a lot of Mr. Greenspan's criteria'' for a cut in interest rates, she said, ''but the economy may be overtaking the budget accord as the primary focus for monetary policy.''
Besides the budget agreement and the bad reading on the economy from the purchasing managers' survey, market participants said a big drop in oil and gold prices also helped buoy prices of fixed-income securities.
''It was a just a good day for the markets,'' one trader of government bonds said.
Based on movements in short-term rates, Treasury bill and note traders are betting on an imminent move by the Fed to bring the funds rate down from its current target level of 8 percent. 3-Month Bills at Lowest At the weekly bill auction yesterday, three-month Treasury bills were sold at an average discount rate of 7.18 percent, the lowest level in nearly two years. A week ago, three-month bills were sold at an average rate of 7.32 percent.
Bids on six-month bills produced an average discount rate of 7.21 percent, down from 7.33 percent a week ago. It is the lowest rate on six-month bills since the auction on Aug. 6.
In the secondary market for Treasury notes, the 8 1/8 percent two-year notes, another security that is closely tied to movements in the Fed funds rate, were offered late yesterday at a price of 100 11/32, up 3/32, to yield 7.93 percent. Yields on two-year notes are generally well above the funds rate, except when an easing of monetary policy is anticipated.
Among longer-dated Treasury issues, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at 98 31/32 late yesterday, up a full point, or $10 for each $1,000 face amount of securities, to yield 8.84 percent, compared with 8.93 percent late on Friday. As recently as a week ago, yields on the bellwether issue stood at 9.16 percent.
Reaction to the budget accord and the day's other developments was more muted in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate and tax-exempt municipal bonds.
 
Corporate Bonds Unchanged
Corporate bond traders said prices of most issues were unchanged on the day. But a number of securities issued by large commercial banks, including Chase Manhattan and Citicorp, posted very strong gains, the traders said.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, traders said prices of most widely quoted issues rose by about three-eighths of a point.
In the taxable new-issue market, the Associates Corporation of North America, a unit of the Ford Motor Company, offered $300 million in three-year notes through an underwriting syndicate led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
The 8.85 percent notes, which mature on Oct. 1, 1993, were priced at $99.944, to yield 8.87 percent, 77 basis points, or hundredths of a point, over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 percent three-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities, which are noncallable for life, are rated AA-3 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and AA-minus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:
 
(000 omitted in dollar figures)

Precious Metals Plummet On Weakening Oil Prices

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Prices of precious metals plunged yesterday in heavy trading, with gold down $16 an ounce, silver falling to its lowest level since 1982 and platinum reaching a four-year low.
Brokers said the selling began overseas in response to weaker oil prices. The declines in precious metals steepened overseas as the Japanese and European stock markets responded favorably to the weaker energy prices. Precious metals prices fell still further after the New York markets opened. 
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, the largest gold and silver futures markets, the spot October gold delivery settled at $386.60 an ounce, down $15.90 on the day. The more active December Comex gold delivery closed down $16.50, at $391.60.
October silver on the Comex plunged 12.1 cents an ounce, to $4.64, with the more active December contract down 12.2 cents, at $4.71. At the New York Mercantile Exchange, the spot October platinum delivery lost $6.30 an ounce, at $426.80, with the more active January contract down $6.50, at $432.60.
 
Weeklong Declines
''The declines in precious metals prices actually began last week, when gold failed to respond to soaring energy costs, a falling stock market and a weaker dollar,'' said Steven J. Pepper, senior vice president at the Republic National Bank of New York, a major bullion dealer. ''It is hard to imagine that after all the turmoil caused by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, gold is now only $10 above what it was then.''
It was the failure of gold to respond to what would normally have been several extremely bullish developments that led many commodity funds and other mutual funds to become the biggest sellers of bullion yesterday, Mr. Pepper said.
Bette Raptopoulos, a metals specialist at Prudential-Bache Securities, said, ''The gold market continued to focus mainly on energy and its potential impact on inflation.''
''Silver and platinum, which are considered industrial metals, were more influenced by the steady decline in industrial activity,'' she said. ''Thus the sharp drop in the monthly index of business activity issued by the National Association of Purchasing Managers reported this morning hurt silver and platinum prices as much as anything else.''
Ms. Raptopoulos said that while spot silver prices hit their lowest level since mid-1982, a recession year, that drop was a quick downward spike. On a more sustained basis, however, silver is now trading at levels not seen since 1977-78, when soaring inflation lifted all precious metals. Before the inflation binge ended, gold and silver set record highs of $850 and $50 an ounce, respectively, on Jan. 21, 1980, while platinum topped out just above $1,000 a few weeks later.
 
Grains in Decline
 
By The Associated Press
Grain futures prices declined sharply yesterday, while meat futures were sharply higher and soybeans lower.
Grains and soybeans fell on the Chicago Board of Trade as a result of increased harvest pressures and declines on the precious metal and energy markets.
Wheat futures prices fell to levels last seen two weeks ago, as doubts grew that the Soviet Union would buy subsidized wheat flour from the Government.
Soybean futures pushed toward double-digit losses as major corporations sold off their interests. Near-ideal weather conditions in harvest areas also depressed prices, said Walter Spilka, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company in New York. Corn followed soybeans and wheat amid the same fears.

Agreement on U.S. Budget Causes the Dollar to Slide

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The deficit-reduction agreement reached in Washington sent the dollar lower against major foreign currencies yesterday. Traders said the agreement was expected to produce a move to lower interest rates soon by the Federal Reserve. 
Lower interest rates in the United States would make dollar-denominated investments less attractive to foreigners seeking high yields.
The dollar ended lower in New York after sharp declines overseas in selling linked to the budget accord, which calls for sizable tax increases and spending cuts.
''People went out and sold the dollar because they're looking for the Fed to cut the discount rate,'' said Arnold Sherrer, the chief foreign exchange trader for the Royal Bank of Canada.
Traders said, though, that the decline stalled in New York with some selling of other currencies to take profits after the drops on foreign markets.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.80 yen to close at 137.15 yen. Later in London, it was quoted lower at 137 yen. In New York, the dollar traded at 136.75 yen, down from 138.50 late Friday.
In London, the pound was quoted at $1.8890, more expensive than $1.8735 late Friday. In New York, it cost $1.8830 to buy a pound, up from $1.8760 late Friday.
Other dollar rates late in New York, compared with Friday's late quotes, included: 1.55735 German marks, down from 1.5670; 1.2960 Swiss francs, down from 1.29735; 5.2195 French francs, down from 5.2455; 1,167.25 Italian lire, down from 1,173.25, and 1.153825 Canadian dollars, down from 1.15425.
Late rates for the dollar in Europe, compared with late Friday's rates, included: 1.5520 German marks, down from 1.5655; 1.2885 Swiss francs, down from 1.2980; 5.1985 French francs, down from 5.2420; 1.7495 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7655; 1,163.50 Italian lire, down from 1,172.25, and 1.1526 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1563.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Toyota Effort Seeks to Show How It Cares About the U.S.

BYLINE: By Kim Foltz

 BODY:
IN a move clearly calculated to counteract the recent spate of anti-Japanese advertising, Toyota Motor Corporate Services of North America Inc. has begun an extensive campaign intended to convince Americans that Toyota cares about their country.
One ad shows the basketball team from North High, a school in Torrance, Calif., that Toyota has adopted. The ad explains some of the big and, just as important, the little things the company has done for the school. The car maker not only underwrote the basketball team, but it also provided summer school scholarships, and Toyota employees are giving some of the students special tutoring and career guidance. 
''The American public doesn't know much about what we've been doing in this country,'' said Timothy P. Andree, a Toyota spokesman. ''We want to show them what we do besides make a good car.''
Toyota's campaign comes when American advertisers are stepping up their attacks on Japanese products, especially automobiles.
But Mr. Andree said the trend and Toyota's campaign were not connected. ''Toyota is becoming more of an American company,'' he said. ''Now that we are a neighbor, we want people to know more about the company and what it believes in.''
Mr. Andree said Toyota manufactured nearly 250,000 cars in the United States and employed thousands of American workers. Toyota Motor Corporate Services, a subsidiary of the Tokyo-based auto maker, is based in New York.
An official of the Japanese Government, who insisted on not being identified, said yesterday that Tokyo had been encouraging Japanese companies doing business in the United States to become more involved in their communities. ''It is something that has been neglected,'' the official said. ''Japanese companies should take the opportunity to explain themselves and what they are doing.''
Some experts on Japan said Toyota's campaign was a wise strategy. ''It will probably be effective in helping to correct some of the American public's misperceptions about Japanese companies,'' said John Wheeler, the vice president of the Japan Society, a private organization in New York devoted to enhancing understanding between the United States and Japan.
Alan Siegel, the chairman of Siegel & Gale, a corporate identity firm, said Toyota's campaign was addressing some concerns of American consumers.
''People want to know what companies are doing and how it will work to the public's advantage,'' Mr. Siegel said. ''If a campaign like Toyota's is done well, it will create the public impression of a caring company.''
Toyota's ''Investing in the Individual'' effort certainly creates the image of Toyota as a compassionate company: Each ad tells a heart-tugging tale.
Take the story of Karla Thomas, who thought she would not be able to go to college. But she got a scholarship, one of 16 that Toyota sponsors each year through the United Negro College Fund. Not only will Ms. Thomas graduate this year with a degree in business administration, the ad explains, but she was also crowned the queen of Bethune-Cookman College in Daytona Beach, Fla., last year.
Another advertisement explains how a $1.3 million donation from Toyota enabled Georgetown, Ky., to build a needed community and child-care center that is teaching preschoolers subjects like Spanish and computers. Toyota also has a plant in Georgetown.
Toyota decided against using television commercials, because the company did not want to overpower people. ''We didn't want it to look like a hard sell,'' said Joanne Davis, the president of OMON, the New York agency that created the campaign. ''By using print, we could tell our stories in rich detail, and that would make them more believable.''

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
TWO GERMANYS UNITE AFTER 45 YEARS WITH JUBILATION AND A VOW OF PEACE

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BERLIN, Wednesday, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Forty-five years after it was carved up in defeat and disgrace, Germany was reunited today in a midnight celebration of pealing bells, national hymns and the jubilant blare of good old German oom-pah-pah.
At the stroke of midnight Tuesday, a copy of the American Liberty Bell, a gift from the United States at the height of the cold war, tolled from the Town Hall, and the black, red and gold banner of the Federal Republic of Germany rose slowly before the Reichstag, the scarred seat of past German Parliaments.
Then the President, Richard von Weizsacker, drawing on the words of the West German Constitution, proclaimed from the steps of the Reichstag: ''In free self-determination, we want to achieve the unity in freedom of Germany. We are aware of our responsibility for these tasks before God and the people. We want to serve peace in the world in a united Europe.'' 
 
Singing of Anthem
With that, a throng estimated at one million joined in the West German national anthem, now the anthem for united Germany: ''Unity and justice and freedom for the German fatherland . . .'' The words are from the third stanza of the prewar anthem, whose opening verses, now banned, began, ''Deutschland, Deutschland uber Alles.''
The moment marked the return of a nation severed along the front line between East and West to the center stage of Europe, this time as an economic powerhouse vowing never again to bring grief to a continent it had so terribly ravaged in the past century.
It is the smallest unified German state to rise in the 119 years since Otto von Bismarck first gathered the Germans under the Prussian crown.
 
Beer and Revelry
Hundreds of German flags waved and firecrackers snapped in the chilly autumn night. Beer and sparkling wine flowed freely and the strains of divergent bands mingled in a rowdy cacophony. Soon bottles began smashing on the pavement and celebration turned to intoxication, and by early morning the center of the new capital was deep in smashed bottles and weaving revelers.
A force of about 5,000 police officers had been massed in case radicals tried to disrupt the festivities, and the police reported seven arrests. But what protests there were passed with no major incidents.
Unity essentially meant that the German Democratic Republic with its 16 million citizens acceded to the Federal Republic of Germany, which expanded to become a state of 78 million souls and 137,900 square miles. The accession meant that the name, anthem, Constitution and Government of the Federal Republic became those of all Germany, that Chancellor Helmut Kohl became the first Chancellor of the reunited state and Mr. von Weizsacker the first President.
 
Berlin Is Capital
Berlin, a city divided by the infamous wall into a gray Communist capital and a glittering capitalist enclave, became once again the political and spiritual capital of Germany.
''Everybody should know: Germany will not go it alone, there will be no unilateral nationalism and no 'restless Reich,' '' vowed Mr. Kohl in an article written for the Frankfurter Allgemeine newspaper.
It was also a moment of poignant lasts. The German Democratic Republic, founded by Soviet occupiers as the ''first state of workers and peasants on German soil,'' expired bankrupt but not entirely unmourned.
At the final session of Parliament, Jens Reich, a leader of the citizens' movements that led demonstrations a year earlier to bring down the Communists, assailed the first and only democratic legislature of East Germany for having done nothing but surrender the state to the West. ''Unity must not become a memory of a stab in the back,'' he said.
 
'Farewell Without Tears'
But a more prevalent note was struck by the East German Prime Minister, Lothar de Maiziere, at the final ''state act'' of the East German Government in the grand Schauspielhaus concert hall, attended by the political and cultural elite of the nation.
There, the first and last democratically elected leader of East Germany committed his state to history with the words: ''In a few moments the German Democratic Republic accedes to the Federal Republic of Germany. With that, we Germans achieve unity in freedom. It is an hour of great joy. It is the end of many illusions. It is a farewell without tears.''
Then Kurt Mazur, the conductor from Leipzig and a hero of the peaceful revolution last fall, rose to conduct Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, with the grand ''Ode to Joy'' in the final movement that for Germans stands as a spiritual hymn to hope.
 
Address by Kohl
Mr. Kohl, capping a year of political successes, addressed the nation on television several hours before unity.
''In a few hours a dream will become reality,'' Mr. Kohl said, his eyes turning misty. ''After 40 bitter years of division, Germany, our fatherland, will be reunited. This is one of the happiest moments of my life. From the many letters and conversations I have had, I know the great joy also felt by the vast majority of you.''
Many Germans, in fact, had spent the last several weeks complaining of the cost and dislocation of unity. But at the moment of unity, Mr. Kohl seemed correct in finding that it was a moment to celebrate.
 
'It Is Really Moving'
The Chancellor also made a point of thanking and reassuring Germany's allies and neighbors. ''In particular,'' he said, ''we thank the United States of America and above all President George Bush.'' Mr. shsh was among the first world leaders to abandon reservations about German unity and endorse Mr. Kohl's efforts.
In recent weeks, the process of unity had drawn growing grumbles from both East and West as Germans came to realize the huge cost of the undertaking. But for the hundreds of thousands who had gathered from across Germany and abroad, this was a night not to moan, but simply to celebrate.
''It is really moving,'' said Heinz Schober, a Berlin shopkeeper who had come with his wife. ''We were here when the wall went up and we were here when it came down, and now we see something children will read about in history books.''
Hundreds of stands along the Unter den Linden peddled everything from bratwurst and beer to ''Day of Unity'' T-shirts and chunks of the Berlin wall. Musicians ranging from rock bands to a Soviet military band to Wolf Biermann, a onetime East German dissident, blared from 16 stages set up among the beer and sausage stands, and all along the mile-long avenue the mood was festive and joyous.
At one point, revelers before the Reichstag pressed hard against the steps, where Chancellor Kohl and other political leaders were gathered, but no problems developed.
The most serious trouble was reported in Gottingen, a West German city near the former border, where about 1,000 radical youths went on a rampage, smashing windows and denouncing unity.
 
Year of Rapid Change
Unity came to the Germans barely a year after streams of East Germans began pouring out through newly porous borders in Hungary and Czechoslovakia, forcing the East German leader, Erich Honecker, to confront a crisis just as he prepared to preside over the celebrations of his state's 40th anniversary.
A year before unity came, on Oct. 3, 1989, a flood of East German refugees had all but overwhelmed the West German Embassy in Czechoslovakia, and the East German Government finally gave permission for the refugees to go west. It also closed its borders, touching off new discontent and disorders.
The celebration of East Germany's anniversary four days later marked the beginning of the state's undoing. The Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, gave the first indications that he was not prepared to prop up the East German Government, and waves of demonstrators clashed with the police in East Berlin and other cities.
The demonstrations rapidly grew, driving the Government into disarray until it took the fateful action on Nov. 9 of opening the Berlin wall a crack, touching off a rush to unity. By March 18 East Germany held its first democratic elections, and by July 1 its economy was merged into West Germany's. The pace accelerated through the summer, bringing formal unity up to Oct. 3 and setting the scene for the celebration.
The pace of events also required a rapid termination of the vestigial occupation under which both the Germanys and the Berlins existed, and the moment of unity was preceded by a flurry of final arrangements and actions to end the Allied controls.
The commanders of the Western Allied forces, the United States, Britain and France, which merged their occupation zones of the city after the war to form West Berlin and defended it against Communist encirclement in ensuing years, met for the last time and ceded authority over the city.
''I now close this final meeting of the Allied Kommandatura with a good, solid bang,'' said the British commander, Maj. Gen. Robert Corbert, pounding the gavel at the Allied headquarters with a solid thump.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Top Soviet General Tells U.S. Not to Attack in Gulf

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON

 BODY:
The head of the Soviet military said yesterday that the economic sanctions against Iraq were working and that no force should be used in the Persian Gulf unless it was approved by the United Nations.
The remarks by the Soviet general, Mikhail A. Moiseyev, Chief of the Soviet General Staff, were the most explicit comments made so far by a Soviet official on the need to have United Nations approval for the use of force by the United States and other nations that have opposed the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
The Soviet general's comments - in an unusual joint interview with Gen. Colin L. Powell, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff - signaled a basic disagreement with Washington about the circumstances under which military force could be used in the Persian Gulf.
''We cannot view the resolution of any crisis like this by means of using arms,'' said General Moiseyev, who is on a tour of the United States as a guest of General Powell. But General Powell pointedly said President Bush had not ruled out any options. 
The two generals were interviewed by writers and editors of The New York Times.
Suggesting that military force was not needed to force Iraqi troops out of Kuwait, General Moiseyev said the economic embargo was beginning to hurt Iraq.
''Saddam Hussein has really understood now finally how far he has gone,'' General Moiseyev said. ''He is finding himself in economic and political isolation, and he can't survive very long that way.''
General Moiseyev asserted that protests, uprisings and desertions in Iraqi were sapping the strength of the Iraqi military and impelling President Hussein to seek a diplomatic solution.
''You can't keep an army together just by using fear and intimidation against your own troops,'' General Moiseyev said. ''Also there are rumors beginning to abound about people who are going to make attempts against Saddan Hussein's life, forcing Hussein to begin to look for ways out of this crisis.''
He said that if military force was used by the United States and its allies, such action should be approved by the United Nations.
 
Trust Between Generals
''I don't see really any other way,'' General Moiseyev said. His position also underscored the reluctance of the Soviet military to be drawn into a conflict in the region.
The Bush Administration, in contrast, has pointedly kept open the possibility of using military force to drive the Iraqis out of Kuwait and of doing so without United Nations sanction, a point General Powell reaffirmed today.
''They see any use of military force being within the context of the United Nations actions,'' General Powell said. ''The United States hopes the situation can be resolved peacefully. We are not eliminating any of the options that are available to the President.''
Flanked by military aides, General Moiseyev sat beside his American counterpart and spoke forcefully on an array of issues. The two men spoke warmly of each other and General Moiseyev said there was complete trust between them. It was a throwback to the days during World War II when the two countries became allies.
General Moiseyev was named Chief of Staff and First Deputy Defense Minister in December 1988. At 49 he was the youngest Soviet Chief of Staff to be chosen since 1952. His promotion from commander of the Far Eastern military district to the ministry post over many senior defense officials was taken as a sign that the Soviet leadership wanted to infuse the military with fresh ideas.
The Soviet general assailed the dwindling prestige of the military in Soviet society and likened it to the fallen stature of the American military after the war in Vietnam. He spoke with evident disdain about the recommendations by Georgi A. Arbatov and other specialists at the U.S.A.-Canada Institute in Moscow and others seeking to overhaul the Soviet military.
 
Israeli Attack on Reactor
In an unusual admission, the Soviet general said that Israel's bombing of the Iraqi nuclear reactor at Osirak in 1981 was understandable.
The United States, the Soviet Union and other nations criticized the action at the time. But General Moiseyev said yesterday, ''There was some sort of foundation or reason for taking the action that Israel undertook.''
But many of the Soviet General's remarks centered on the Persian Gulf, a subject he discussed with President Bush at a White House meeting yesterday before he and General Powell came to New York.
Pentagon officials said last week that there appeared to be a split between top Soviet Foreign Ministry officials who had called for tough action against Iraq and their counterparts in the military who wanted to maintain some measure of influence with Baghdad by maintaining advisers there.
Whatever the merits of that Pentagon analysis, General Moiseyev repeatedly counseled against the use of force against Iraq and defended the continuing presence of Soviet advisers, whom he called technicians, insisting that they were making no contribution to the Iraqi military and saying that their presence represented legitimate economic relations between Moscow and Baghdad.
 
Plan for U.N. Panel
General Moiseyev said that the United Nations Military Staff Committee should be activated and that Foreign Ministry officials from all the nations opposing Iraq should meet as part of the commission to analyze the situation.
The general, who said he had proposed the activation of the committee to President Bush yesterday, said the committee could prepare an additional resolution setting a timetable for resolving the crisis.
''I do not think Hussein is going to go for fighting the whole world,'' the Soviet general said.
General Powell said the United States would consider the Soviet suggestion to activate the committee but expressed caution about whether it would contribute to a solution of the crisis in the gulf.
The Soviet general insisted that Moscow had only 206 advisers, including 42 interpreters, in Iraq, and that none were linked to the Soviet military. He said that Iraq had posed no barriers to the withdrawal of the technicians, who he said were involved in ''trade relations'' and that 77 were close to fulfilling their contract and would return to the Soviet Union soon.
But he dismissed the suggestion that Moscow immediately withdraw the rest, saying ''normal, healthy contacts with all countries'' were justified.
General Powell said General Moiseyev had presented a breakdown of the 206 technicians, which the Pentagon would examine. The Pentagon has said Moscow has from 500 to 1,000 military and civilian advisers in Iraq and that some of them are maintaining Iraqi aircraft.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET AGREEMENT;
Pivotal Moment for Bush

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
With his speech tonight from the Oval Office, George Bush completed a fundamental transition: The President who succeeded for so long at giving Americans only good news is now telling them to prepare for economic pain at home and the possibility of war abroad.
With remarkable speed, Mr. Bush has moved from the most protracted honeymoon in recent White House history to twin crises that could determine the success of his Presidency.
The decision to confront the Republican rebellion on Capitol Hill over the budget agreement quickly and directly in a nationally televised speech represented a judgment that any delay could allow events to spin out of control. If the emerging prospects for passage of the budget package turn into defeat, Mr. Bush would immediately lose his calculated gamble that such an agreement would be good for the economy and thus bolster his re-election campaign in 1992. 
For more than a year and a half, everything seemed to be going Mr. Bush's way, especially in Europe. Then on Aug. 8, six days after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, Mr. Bush went on national television to announce that he was sending troops to the Persian Gulf and to prepare the country for the possibility that American soldiers and civilians could die in a far-off war.
Tonight, less than two months later, Mr. Bush again spoke from the Oval Office to add the bitter message that American must also prepare for 12 cents a gallon more in gasoline taxes, reduced Federal spending in such touchy areas as medical care for the elderly and a generally tighter economy.
 
Appeal to the People
Telling his audience tonight that ''this deficit agreement is tough and so are the times,'' Mr. Bush said: ''This is the first time in my Presidency that I've made an appeal like this to you, the American people. With your help, we can at last put this budget crisis behind us and face the challenges that lie ahead.''
Suddenly, the 1988 campaign events at which loudspeakers blared ''Don't worry, be happy,'' seemed very distant. Mr. Bush was selling a budget agreement that not only violated his no-tax campaign pledge but did not include the reduction in the capital gains tax rate that the President had made a crusade.
In a significant revision of his political rhetoric, the politician who tarred his 1988 opponent as a tax-and-spend liberal and only two weeks ago was attacking Congressional Democrats over the budget used his television appearance tonight instead to make a pitch for budget coordination that at times sounded like a set-up for the televised speech that followed, by George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate majority leader.
So far, public support for the Persian Gulf operation appears to be strong. But the budget crisis is one that tests Mr. Bush's ability to manage the economy, one of his chief selling points in the 1988 campaign, as well as his sway over Congress and his control of his own party.
The decision for Mr. Bush to go on television was reached so quickly that speech writers were typing virtually until broadcast time. But the buffeting that top aides like John H. Sununu, the chief of staff, and Richard G. Darman, the budget director, took on Capitol Hill on Monday left a clear message for a seasoned political professional like Mr. Bush: This was a time when there was no substitute for Presidential authority, and not to use it meant the risk of losing it.
''The President recognizes that these are twin tests of his leadership,'' a White House official said tonight. ''But he obviously thinks he can rise to them. It will be a big victory if he can carry this through, just as if we can come through the crisis in the Middle East, the President will have shown leadership in a big way.''
 
Good Position, Big Risk
The President is in a good position to confront his new challenge; his popularity, higher than any other Presidents' at the same point of his Administration, lends him political armor. The White House was confident that Mr. Bush would win over Congress and succeed in persuading the public that the budget package announced in the Rose Garden on Sunday is, at least, a necessary evil.
But Mr. Bush is also without question taking a major political risk. Not only was he forced to do much of the work for Democrats as well as Republicans in selling the budget agreement with only his fourth nationally televised Oval Office speech, but he was making it a personal test in his own party.
Although they strove to establish an air of bipartisanship, Democrats in Congress did not hesitate to point out Mr. Bush's difficulty. ''The President has been reticent until now to tell anybody anything they didn't want to hear,'' said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader.
 
Vows Public and Private
White House officials said Mr. Bush had intended all along to make a televised appeal on behalf of the budget agreement, something he had promised he would do, both publicly and in private with Democratic leaders of Congress.
But they said the timing assumed new urgency today after two meetings at the White House with rebellious Republican congressmen, and with the first test vote in the House of Representatives only two days away. Mr. Bush will be on the road on Thursday, campaigning for Republican candidates in New England.
''It's not that we are in a panic,'' one official said. ''Things seem to be going our way, but gradually, and there are a lot of people who need the cover to tell their constitutents that the President went on national TV and also personally asked for their support.''
Mr. Bush's task is complicated by the public defiance of Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip, who should be rallying the troops on Capitol Hill but instead has broken with the bipartisan budget agreement. When the White House invited key Republicans down from the Hill today for the meetings with Mr. Bush, Mr. Gingrich was not included.
Observing this spectacle, a leading House Democrat said, ''It's a little like having the secret police turn against you.''
 
'A Serious Moment in Life'
Harry C. McPherson Jr., who served as an adviser to President Lyndon B. Johnson, said, ''From what I've read about the Republican cloakroom, this does sound like a serious moment in life for George Bush.''
Mr. McPherson said the President was in a far better position than Johnson during a similar moment, when he had to confront American opposition to the Vietnam war, fight inflation at home and impose a surtax on personal incomes to pay for that very conflict.
''In the minds of the public I think the deficit and Saddam Hussein are stuff that has happened to Bush. '' Mr. McPherson said.
But, he said, ''In talking about the pain that has to be endured because of the deficit maybe this is finally the time when the public is going to connect the Republican Administration and Bush himself with the deficit.''

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET AGREEMENT;
In Appeal for Support for Budget, President Calls Plan Best for Now

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Faced with a revolt in his party's Congressional ranks and wariness around the country, President Bush appealed on television tonight for public support of the budget compromise he and Congressional leaders struck last weekend. He predicted ''economic chaos if we fail to reduce the deficit.''
In a show of bipartisanship that verged on coalition Government, the President was followed with a broadcast by Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader. He urged support for the President ''because the nation is more important than partisan differences.'' [Transcripts of the Bush and Mitchell speeches appear on page D28.] Mr. Mitchell was preaching to the converted for the most part. Despite considerable opposition among liberals, a majority of Congressional Democrats appear to support the agreement.
 
Tough Task for Bush
But Mr. Bush has the more difficult task of swaying enough dissident Republicans to win enactment of the plan. 
The President said that neither he nor anyone else was completely satisfied with the compromise, but he said it was ''the best agreement that can be legislated now.''
In the strongest statement he has made about economic perils that might lie ahead, Mr. Bush emphasized: ''If we fail to enact this agreement, our economy will falter, markets may tumble and recession will follow.''
He called on the public to ''tell your Congressmen and Senators you support this deficit-reduction agreement.''
 
A Bipartisan Appeal
The President continued: ''If they are Republicans, urge them to stand with the President. If they are Democrats, urge them to stand with their Congressional leaders.''
''Those who dislike one part or another may pick our agreement apart,'' Mr. Bush said, ''but if they do, believe me, the political reality is no one can put a better one back together again.''
Senator Mitchell made almost identical points. He would have preferred ''a budget that asks more from the wealthy and less from the elderly,'' he said. But as for the compromise, he concluded, ''For America's economic future, we have to pass it.''
 
Personal Appeals
The President spent most of the day making personal appeals to Republican lawmakers, who are the crucial to passage. He invited about three dozen of them to the White House in three groups and telephoned several others.
Early indications were that the arm-twisting, based on personal and party loyalty, was paying dividends.
''I think the President can win,'' said Representative Vin Weber of Minnesota, a leader of the right flank of the party in the House that is opposing the budget plan.
''The President has already made it a test of party loyalty,'' Mr. Weber added.
 
Opposition From Republicans
A preliminary count showed 60 or 70 of the 176 House Republicans firmly against the plan, a handful committed to it unequivocally and the rest undecided, at least officially.
Representative Jerry Lewis of California, the third-ranking member of the Republican leadership and a supporter of the President, observed that the vocal opposition was largely coming from the most conservative Republicans and the most liberal Democrats.
''There ought to be a lot of room in the middle for a majority of our party to support it,'' Mr. Lewis said.
In the maneuvering today, John H. Sununu, Mr. Bush's chief of staff, Richard G. Darman, the budget director, and other top policy makers were arguing that it was essential to support the President and enforce party discipline, according to Administration officials and lawmakers who talked to the President.
Many other Administration officials have dropped almost everything to concentrate on winning approval of the budget plan.
Vice President Dan Quayle made dozens of calls to lawmakers and was interviewed by the television networks and local stations. Mr. Quayle and Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, canceled campaign trips for Republicans challenging Congressional Democrats so they could stay Washington for the hard sell.
 
Federal Reserve's View
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, had nothing to do with devising the budget plan, but he may be a crucial player in selling it. In their lobbying, Administration officials are citing Mr. Greenspan's view that interest rates will come down if the politicians enact a credible longterm plan to lower the deficit.
Lower rates would encourage companies and individuals to borrow and spend and thus stimulate the economy. Moreover, they would mean the Government would have to pay less on the money it borrows.
The Federal Open Market Committee, the policy-making arm of the Federal Reserve, met here today, but as usual its decisions were not announced.
Mr. Bush, meanwhile, was describing the deal as good for America and the best he could get from a Congress controlled by Democrats.
 
First Test Is Thursday
Republican opponents of the plan are maintaining that the higher taxes it calls for and the lack of a lower tax rate on capital gains would drain an already flagging economy and increase the likelihood of a recession.
The first test votes in both chambers are scheduled for Thursday on the overall budget resolution, which is a broad framework for spending and taxes but not the specific policies. If the measure clears this hurdle, the crucial votes will come week after next on the particular elements of the agreement.
Some lawmakers are predicting that the House might reject the resolution Thursday in a sort of protest vote and then pass the measure the next day.
The White House and Congressional leaders are confident that the plan will pass the Senate with the support of a majority of senators from both parties. The party leaders in the Senate, Mr. Mitchell, and Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, worked on a strategy today to have the Senate vote first to increase the pressure on the House. But Mr. Mitchell said this afternoon that the parliamentary rules might make that impossible.
The plan also faces serious opposition among liberal Democrats in the House and around the country. But if a majority of House Republicans backs the measure, a majority of House Democrats will almost certainly go along, some out of loyalty to their leaders, others because they realize that it is the best plan they can get and that reducing the deficit is of primary importance.
The liberals argue that higher taxes on gasoline and other products would place too much of the burden of deficit reduction on poor and middle-income Americans and that deep cuts in Medicare would make the plan even more unfair.
 
Opposition From Governors
From Albany, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo expressed the liberal opposition. ''I believe this deal would be surrender to the failed policies of the last 10 years and should be rejected,'' the Democrat wrote in a letter to the New York Congressional delegation.
''It makes things worse for the middle class, the elderly, the states and local governments,'' he continued.
Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia made similar points in a letter he sent to Ronald H. Brown, chairman of the Democratic National Committee who is a supporter of the plan. ''Our two-party system,'' Governor Wilder wrote, ''is becoming a competition between the party inside Washington and that new party, the vast majority of Americans who live outside.''
Earlier today at the White House, Mr. Bush gave his pitch to a group of business leaders. ''This budget agreement is our last best chance to get the Federal budget deficit under control,'' he said. ''To all the people that disagree and the people on the sidelines that are rushing out and having their press conferences and the critics, let me say this: 'You can pick the package apart, but you cannot realistically put a better package together.' ''
He apologized to the business group for abandoning his drive for a lower capital gains tax. ''The philosophy I was elected on runs out of gas in terms of votes in the United States Congress,'' he declared.
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House press secretary, said Mr. Bush would continue to press for the budget compromise in speeches around the country, beginning with New England stops on Thursday and Friday.
''A lot of people who disagree with this,'' Mr. Fitzwater said. ''A lot of people have trouble with it. And they need to be convinced. And we'll do our best.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
U.S. CARRIER SAILS INTO PERSIAN GULF

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The United States bolstered its forces in the Persian Gulf yesterday with the arrival of the aircraft carrier Independence, and France fired warning shots at a freighter suspected of violating the United Nations embargo on Iraq.
The Independence, along with its battle group and four minesweepers, sailed through the Strait of Hormuz, the gateway to the gulf. Its mission was described as a combined ''show of strength'' and training mission. 
According to figures released yesterday by the Pentagon, the total American strength in the gulf region now exceeds 170,000. The Pentagon estimated that Iraqi strength in Kuwait and southern Iraq is 430,000, unchanged from a week ago.
It was only the second time that an American aircraft carrier has entered the Persian Gulf. The Constellation did so in 1974, according to Navy records.
 
First Action by France
Carriers have been kept out of the gulf because of the increased threat of mines or surprise attack in its relatively shallow confined waters and in an effort to avoid undue affront to Iran and the Arab nations along its shores.
Lieut. Cmdr. Mark Walker, a Navy spokesman, said the Independence will be ''a visible demonstration of the operational capabilities of a carrier battle group to our friends and allies in the region,'' and was not meant to increase tensions. But a military source said the Independence was certain to show President Saddam Hussein of Iraq that American naval air power could easily be employed against targets in Iraq and Kuwait.
The naval action yesterday was the first in which France used naval firepower to help enforce the trade embargo against Iraq. The frigate Doudart de Lagree fired warning shots to halt a North Korean freighter near Djibouti in the Bab al Mandab, the strait which links the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden.
 
Defied French Order
French military officials said the freighter, Sam Il Po, had defied an order to stop for inspection. The vessel was searched and then released when it did not appear to be violating the United Nations embargo. Officials did not say where the freighter began its journey or where it was headed.
It was the fifth interception in which warning shots were fired since the blockade was imposed Aug. 6, four days after Iraq invaded Kuwait. The earlier incidents involved American warships and an Australian frigate.
To reduce the economic impact of the embargo on countries most dependent on trade ties with Iraq and Kuwait, the European Community said yesterday that it would provide $1.5 billion in aid to Egypt, Jordan and Turkey.

HEADLINE: IMMIGRATION BILL DEBATED IN HOUSE

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
The House of Representatives began debate today on legislation that would significantly increase the number of skilled foreign workers who could move to the United States each year and increase the overall number of immigrants to this country by more than a quarter of a million people a year.
The legislation, which many describe as one of the biggest changes of the nation's immigration laws in 25 years, faces the threat of a veto by President Bush and complaints by many conservative members of Congress that increasing immigration from the current limit of 540,000 a year to 775,000 would allow an excessively high number of immigrants, take jobs from American citizens and enlarge the unemployment and welfare roles.
Congress last addressed immigration in 1986 when it passed legislation that granted amnesty to almost 1.7 million illegal immigrants who had come to the United States before 1982 and imposed fines and other sanctions on employers of illegal aliens. The law aimed to slow the flow of illegal aliens into this country. 
 
Passage Seems Near Certain
Passage of the new legislation seemed almost certain today as the House rejected an amendment proposed by Representative Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas, on behalf of the White House, that would have reduced the number of immigrants permitted by the measure from 775,000 a year to 630,000, a level more acceptable to President Bush. That measure lost by a vote of 143 to 266.
''I think the vote on the Smith cap shows we will pass the bill,'' said Representative Bruce A. Morrison, Democrat from Connecticut and chief architect of the legislation.
Advocates of the legislation argue that while a major purpose of the bill is to accelerate family unification, the bill's fundamental effort is to attract a large number of more highly skilled foreign workers to the United States.
For more than a year, economists and policy experts have been arguing that the country will face critical labor shortages among highly skilled workers, and that one solution is to open up the doors to such workers from abroad.
 
Arguments for Skilled Workers
These economists argue that such a lack of skilled workers, like engineers, scientists and technicians, could seriously undermine the competitiveness of American industry in this decade and the next century.
While the White House has opposed the House bill, it has supported a Senate provision that limits the total number of immigrants at 630,000 a year and places the same emphasis on attracting skilled workers.
Under the House bill, the number of skilled workers who could enter the United States, based solely on sponsorship by employers, would rise to 65,000 each year from less than 30,000.
The bill would seek to expedite the process for companies seeking to sponsor workers. Companies now have to wait up to three years to get visas for foreign skilled workers.
But in order to secure the visas, companies would have to attest in filings with the Department of Labor that they could not fill the positions with American workers. Unions could challenge such applications and the business community continues to be concerned that such a plan might prove difficult.
The legislation also would create a special category of ''priority workers,'' like professors, researchers, business executives and managers who would be able to immigrate without company sponsorship or claim of labor shortages and without having to claim family ties.
''If you don't do that, what you get is an immigration policy that may be turning away Albert Einsteins,'' said Stephen K. Moore, senior fellow at the Alexis de Tocqueville Institute in Stanford, Calif., a public policy institution.
 
Unifying Families
The legislation also seeks to expedite the process of unifying families. It would, just as current law, place no limit on the number of children and spouses of citizens who can immigrate. But the new legislation would increase to 115,000 a year the number of spouses and children under 21 years old of permanent residents who could enter the country, and permit 35,000 adult children of permanent residents. This is up from 70,000 under current law.
Moreover, the legislation would waive the limit of 20,000 immigrants from any one single country in the case of spouses and minor chiildren of permanent residents. This is considered one of the most significant measures, since in some instances the 20,000 limit has created huge waiting lists.

HEADLINE: The Thin Blue Line: Widen It

 BODY:
In the last few weeks, Mayor David Dinkins of New York bobbled his first big crisis. The city was spooked by violent crime and the best he could do was mumble about a report to come in October from Police Commissioner Lee Brown.
Now Mr. Brown has delivered the report - and it is an impressive document. Coupled with the Mayor's additional proposals for enhancements of criminal justice, it could become a basis for Mr. Dinkins's recovery on the crime issue. 
The report gives sobering statistics: in 1970, 31,700 uniformed officers took 887,598 crime reports. Last year, there were 1.1 million reports but the force had declined to 25,817. Even after the city's fiscal recovery, the Koch administration allowed patrol strength to erode.
Searching for ways to rebuild the patrol force, Mr. Brown stared at the department's sprawling organization chart. He turned up hundreds of officers fully trained for street duty but assigned to do things like repair police boats and set up barriers at street fairs.
He proposes eliminating or compressing some of these units and hiring 2,961 civilians to staff others. He would also shift some police routines to firefighters and corrections officers. And he would more than double previously contemplated recruiting for a total of 6,479. All this would yield 9,603 more officers for street duty.
The strength of the Commissioner's report entails far more than numbers. The increase in patrol strength would permit a dramatic expansion of the aggressive strategy called community patrol. The department's ability to adopt it remains severely limited because there are not enough officers even to handle the steady stream of 911 calls. Mr. Brown's analysts calculate that the 9,603 new patrol officers could free a third of the patrol force from 911 duty. The report acknowledges the need to help other law enforcement agencies accommodate arrests that the added police would generate; there might be 50,000 more arrests by 1993. Mr. Dinkins calls for more jail space, prosecutors, legal aid lawyers and probation officers. And he would devote $120 million to new school programs that are designed to engage youngsters and prevent crime.
There are soft spots in the plan. The city might not be able to find enough qualified police recruits without lowering standards and inviting misconduct problems. The planned jail expansion would begin with 600 beds in dormitories, which are hard to control, and the cells it would create may not suffice. The plan hardly acknowledges the need for more judges. Nevertheless, the program constitutes a plausible, professional response to public anxiety.
The tormenting questions focus on its cost: $644 million a year. Mr. Dinkins proposes a payroll tax on workers and commuters, an increase in the property tax, and a surcharge on lottery tickets that would finance the $120 million school program.
City Hall officials suggest that the impact on individuals would be relatively slight: an additional $10 in property tax next year, $50 in payroll tax on income of $50,000 annually. Other analysts think that's glib.
For one thing, the city's sinking economy might not produce enough taxes to pay for the program. Even more important, they would have to be paid on top of taxes already imposed to balance this year's budget. The city could be in even deeper financial difficulties next year. Meanwhile, Albany's cooperation is far from certain.
But the plan need not, in any case, be adopted in full immediately; there will be time for New Yorkers to assess how much they value safe streets. This anti-crime plan proposes sensible goals - and plausible steps to achieve them. For that, the Commissioner and the Mayor deserve generous credit.

HEADLINE: Governing America by Cabal

 BODY:
Sixteen years ago, in an unusual stroke of good sense, Congress created an orderly Federal budget process. It was never perfect, but then came the mammoth deficits of the Reagan years, which killed it.
Instead of basing budgets on reasoned, public review of spending demands and potential revenue, critical decisions are now made on an all-or-nothing basis by Administration officials and a handful of Congressmen, negotiating in secret, not knowing themselves exactly what they've done. 
The process amounts to governing by cabal, and that's no way to run the U.S. Government.
Prior to the 1974 budget law, spending was handled by the appropriations committees and committees with jurisdiction over subsidy and benefit programs. Tax committees handled taxes and some entitlements. No one considered the total impact of what was being enacted piecemeal. There was no attempt to construct a budget that made economic sense.
The 1974 act created House and Senate budget committees to do that, starting with a plan shaped before the other committees barged ahead, each in its own area. The system worked creakily, and then broke down because of the preposterous assumption of Reaganomics - that it was possible to pump up defense spending, slash taxes and still balance the budget.
Congress bought Mr. Reagan's nostrums, because more spending and lower taxes were irresistible. The deficits that ensued were no surprise.
Not until 1985, after gorging itself on four deficits in the $200 billion zone, did Congress try to put a lock on the refrigerator door with the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law. It was sold as a guaranteed formula for reducing the deficit so rigorously that the budget could be balanced by 1990.
The budgeting process has become so mired in dispute over what to cut that Congress couldn't complete its work by Oct. 1, when a new fiscal year began. Stalemate intensified because President Bush insisted on no new taxes and, indeed, on cutting the tax on capital gains. Members, meanwhile, balked at reducing popular spending.
The only way out of impasse, or deeper debt, was negotiation between the White House and Congressional leaders. And even now, the budget compromise is not a done deal; it must be approved, in a rush, by both houses before they adjourn for next month's election.
This all-or-nothing compromise is better than nothing. But it is far worse than sensible government. Neither the negotiators nor their Congressional colleagues can possibly know, for instance, how the proposed new investment incentives will play out. Without hearings or study, it's impossible to know just what the Medicare cutbacks will do to health care for the elderly.
This package will reduce the budget deficit. But the way it was achieved also reduces Americans' respect for the way their Government works.

HEADLINE: Fuel Economy and Auto Safety Don't Mix

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In ''The Second-Best Way to Save Gas'' (editorial, Sept. 20), you grossly oversimplify when you describe the bill of Senator Richard A. Bryan requiring 20 percent improvements in new car fuel economy by 1995, 40 percent by 2001, as a ''potent prescription'' to curb oil imports, the trade deficit, smog and global warming.
Auto makers support energy conservation and will continue to develop more fuel-efficient automobiles. But oil imports have risen relentlessly under fuel-economy legislation and are now higher than the mid-1970's, although new car-fuel economy has improved more than 100 percent since then to almost 28 miles a gallon. There is no reason to believe that further increases in vehicle fuel economy, by themselves, will reduce our dependence on foreign oil. 
Nor will higher fuel economy standards roll back smog or avert global warming. If the cost of driving declines as fuel economy increases, most motorists are likely to drive more, negating projected benefits for gasoline conservation, air pollution and global warming.
Models are now available that get more than 40 or 50 miles a gallon and therefore meet or far exceed the fuel economy required by the Bryan bill. But their sales - the only barometer of consumer preference - are less than 3 percent of the market.
Most of the technologies cited by higher fuel economy advocates -fuel injection, front-wheel drive, overhead camshafts - are widely used in today's fleet. However, the most dramatic improvement has been the shaving of 1,000 pounds from the average vehicle since 1973.
Fuel savings from such developing technologies as continuously variable transmission, two-cycle engines and advanced composite materials would be incremental.
The fuel-economy standards proposed by Senator Bryan would require further size reductions - as much as 1,000 pounds more - and place severe restrictions on the availability of larger vehicles. This would limit consumer choice to compact and smaller vehicles. Family sedans and mini-vans, and the full-size vans and pickups relied on by United States farms and businesses, would be hard to find and costly.
Equally important is the impact of the Bryan bill on auto safety. Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner has called the Bryan bill ''irresponsible,'' adding that ''further major downsizing would result in a tragic tradeoff for the American public - an elusive promise of greater fuel economy against a guarantee of increased highway deaths and dis-abling injuries.''
Improved fuel efficiency makes sense - but not at the expense of highway safety or disregarding the implications.

HEADLINE: Fuel Economy and Auto Safety Don't Mix;
Europe Can Do It

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Secretary of Transportation Samuel K. Skinner has said about Senator Richard A. Bryan's bill to mandate higher miles-per-gallon standards by 2001, that such standards are ''un-attainable from a technology viewpoint'' (Business Day, Sept. 15).
Apparently, Mr. Skinner is unaware of European manufacturing technology. The AX-10, produced by Citroen, gets 76 miles a gallon, at a constant highway speed of 56 miles per hour. Some Japanese cars sold in the United States, the Honda Civic, for example, get 55 miles a gallon.
We missed our chance to take the necessary conservation steps some 10 years ago, during the last energy crisis. We may have a large military force in the Persian Gulf, but we are not getting any leadership from the Bush Administration in the vital area of energy conservation.
Jumping to the defense of the automobile industry was the mistake that we made when the standards for miles per gallon were lowered during the Reagan Presidency. We may not get another chance to correct this error.

HEADLINE: FOREIGN AFFAIRS;
Japan's Past Weighs

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
Japan is suddenly distressed to find it doesn't know what to do and think. Some people call it profoundly painful and embarrassing. Some are resentful at U.S. pressure, and the same people say that if America didn't insist, Japan wouldn't do anything.
There is a sense that this is a watershed, but it is recognized with admitted confusion and a certain nostalgia for the sheltered, profitable cold war, when the only issue was whether to follow America willingly or in righteous irritation. There isn't a consensus, that sacrosanct requirement for Japanese society, and yet there is a consensus that a new era has started and Japan just isn't ready for it. 
All this was coming anyway, with somewhat belated awareness that Japan has become a great economic power and can claim commensurate political weight. But the Persian Gulf crisis has dramatically enforced the pace. The key phrase is ''Japan's role in the world.'' It is a question without an answer. The mood is that it's unfair of the world to ask Japan to hurry up and decide.
If these are vague replies to American complaints that Japan has been free-riding and won't pay its fare now that it is rich, it is because the Tokyo establishment is vague, even when it uses harsh words. If the Japanese don't know what they want, the U.S. can't expect to figure it out.
When leading figures are asked -politicians, businessmen, bureaucrats, journalists, academics - the replies tend to be negative. Japan doesn't want to be pushed around by Big Brother; it doesn't want to be bilked; it doesn't want to be left out. It doesn't want to be treated as no more than a balance sheet. It too has national interests.
But ask if it has a stake in the gulf. Yes, of course, but most say it is because there must be peace. War or wild oil prices would ruin the economy. Few go beyond either cosmic slogans or the pesky details in each day's headlines about what Japan is being asked to do. Few have a positive answer about the kind of world Japan would like to exist in, about the kind of contribution it would like to make.
''You are Cartesian; we are pragmatic,'' was the way one politician put it. He seemed to mean: ''We are just trying to look after ourselves and keep out of trouble.'' That is still seen as the virtuous lesson drawn from defeat in World War II, the sage alternative to a sense of mission and attempts to fix other peoples' troubles.
A critic - and there are many -put it another way. He compared Japan before and during World War II to Saddam Hussein. ''Our policy was 'to make the world a home,' meaning that Japan should be master. Now we just want to live in the house.''
Waharu Hiraizumi, one of the more defiant who is a member of the Diet and a former Minister, asked why Japan should be given less confidence and acceptance than Germany. The German comparison comes up often.
There are three important differences. One is that Japan hasn't come to terms with its war, investigated and acknowledged it culturally anywhere near to the extent that Germany has. The second is that the inner structure of Japanese society, the hierarchy and acceptance of command from powers that be, hasn't changed as much.
The third is that Japan hasn't meshed its interests with a group of other nations so that any nationalistic impulses are constrained by mutual interests. Japan has no family, like the European Community. It deals with patrons and clients.
It isn't true that Japan is using its neighbors' fears of a renewed militarism as a pretext to avoid exposing itself to foreign danger. The fears are real, among Japanese as well. They have fine arguments about why it couldn't happen, but they aren't that sure of themselves.
After all, the first problem, the war, is what blocks advance on the others. Why it can't be digested provokes so many answers that there obviously isn't a right one. A curious explanation is the respect for elders, and especially the late Emperor Hirohito. To look too closely into what happened would be to diminish a figure who was revered, to criticize forebears, some explain.
Now that there is a new Emperor, the past can be explored more honestly, they say. The new generation can face the terrible questions. But others say the new generation, in absence of knowledge beyond the fact that the war was lost, is coming to feel that Japan was the victim, that it deserves sympathy and owes nothing.
These dilemmas don't justify Japan's failure to accept the responsibility of its success. But crude Japan-bashing won't resolve them. The Japanese have to think harder.

HEADLINE: Teacher Pact: Bad Timing By City Hall?

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT

 BODY:
For City Hall, the settling of its labor contract with the teachers ahead of New York's other municipal unions was a classic case of bad timing, labor experts familiar with the negotiations said yesterday.
The jockeying over that contract - a one-year pact with a 5.5 percent raise costing $236 million - involved one of the oldest tactics that unions and managements use against each other. The object is to maneuver for advantage over who goes first and to set the pattern for other contracts. In this case the teachers union was successful, the experts say. 
The tactics are employed by both sides. The automobile workers, for example, made an art of picking the most vulnerable of the Big Three car manufacturers as their target to win a good contract, forcing the other companies to follow. Newspaper publishers sometimes single out the weakest of their unions, then extract concessions from the rest.
 
City Has Been Losing Teachers
In the city's bargaining, the teachers offered strong arguments for a better-than-average raise. City schools have been losing teachers to suburbs paying thousands of dollars more. And to finance the raise the union pointed to potential pension-fund savings and unspent state education aid.
But to give the teachers their raise first would set a tantalizing precedent that would prompt all the other unions to demand parity, the labor experts say. Even before it happened, the city's financial watchdogs were growling about the possibility.
So why did Mayor David N. Dinkins do just that? He tried to avoid it, his aides say, but he fell victim to more unfortunate timing. The teachers' contact expired at midnight Sunday, and of all the municipal unions, only the United Federation of Teachers has a strict no-contract, no-work policy.
At the last minute, the city tried to hurry up its talks with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. The city wanted to get their contracts settled - with a more modest raise - ahead of the teachers.
Shortly after sundown ended the Yom Kippur holy day on Saturday, Barry L. Feinstein, the leader of the Teamsters Local 237, went to Gracie Mansion for intensified bargaining. The talks lasted until nearly midnight but fell short of agreement.
Some critics said the Dinkins administration got itself into a jam. Norman M. Adler, a union and polticial consultant, said: ''They didn't do the smart thing. If they had moved faster with Barry, this wouldn't have happened.''
Efforts then resumed with the teachers' union, even as its leaders prepared to seek the endorsement of its delegate assembly on Monday for authorization to strike. The talks at Gracie Mansion neared agreement early that morning and were concluded a few hours later.
Now the other unions are demanding to match the teachers' raise, and several financial experts are saying that to do so would break the city budget.
''Why they settled with the teachers first, I'll never understand,'' said Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit group financed largely by private business.
 
'The Wrong Signal'
Henry J. Stern, president of the Citizens Union, a civic organization, said: ''The teachers deserve a raise, but the city just doesn't have the money. It's exactly the wrong signal for the city to send at this time.''
Mr. Horton called the pact ''the Mayor's first big fiscal mistake.'' He warned that if the other unions ''get anything close to this settlement, then this year's budget is completely blown out of the water,'' causing more tax increases or service reductions, or both.
Mayor Dinkins has defended the settlement, saying that it averted a strike, that the 5.5 percent raise was within the rate of inflation and that the direct cost to the city will actually not exceed the 1.5 percent previously allocated in the city budget because it will be partly financed through pension-fund savings and state aid. The Mayor's aides said the teachers' contract does not commit the city to granting the same raise to other unions.
Some labor experts question whether the teachers really would have gone on strike. One city official, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified, said: ''In these economic times, would the teachers have struck to get another 1 or 2 percent? I doubt it.''
But the union's president, Sandra Feldman, who was one of the first labor leaders to endorse Mayor Dinkins when he ran for election, said ''all that speculation is silly.'' Commenting on the seriousness of the strike preparations, a union aide, Susan Amlung, said, ''We have 50,000 picket signs sitting around our offices now.''

HEADLINE: DINKINS ON CRIME;
Telling the Public to Put Money Where Its Fear Is

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins's proposed payroll tax would cost about 50 cents a week - $26 a year - for a person earning $26,000 a year in 1991 and 75 cents a week - $39 a year - in 1993.
For a small company - one with, say, 10 employees earning an average of $30,000 apiece - the tax would come to less than $450 a year.
Homeowners could expect a $10 increase in their property tax bills in 1991 and $20 by 1993.
Taken alone, those payments may sound like relatively small change. But the Mayor's plan to remold New York City's crime-fighting forces would require New Yorkers to swallow another tax burden at a time of rising personal and municipal economic pain. 
 
The Price of Protection
And when those figures are added to the menu of tax rises in the 1991 city budget approved in the spring, and to the Federal tax increases agreed to just this week by the White House and Congressional leaders, questions arise: Will New Yorkers' reluctance to pay new taxes outweigh their fear of crime? And will this new tax burden place an unbearable strain on the city's economy?
''We're putting to the test how frightened we really are when we finally have to put up the cash, ostensibly to make a difference,'' said James Shenton, a Columbia University history professor who specializes in New York City issues. ''I am amused by the possibility that what we are going to discover is that when people have to start paying for what they say they fear, they are not going to be as frightened as they say they are.''
Some financial specialists question the Mayor's methods of paying for the new officers, specifically using the payroll tax.
''If it was just that, no problem,'' said Stuart Kessler, a certified public accountant in Manhattan, ''I'd pay.'' But he said that because the Mayor wanted employers to match the tax on employees, big businesses might consider leaving the city and the state. It is not a new argument, but whether it is only bluff and bluster or whether some companies really do pack up and leave remains to be seen. Little Choice? But some economists say that New Yorkers have little choice but to smile and suffer the higher taxes, both at the municipal and Federal levels. ''The American people are the lowest-taxed people in the whole developed world,'' said Rosemary Scanlon, an economist for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, ''and even at that, what the Federal Government taxed us for in the 1980's was primarily defense.''
Now, she said, the realization that social problems were ignored has increased people's willingness to pay for programs that promise improvements. She also said that local taxes are resented less than Federal taxes - in part because local taxes pay for services taxpayers can see, not high-priced intangibles like space-based weapons that may never get off the drawing board. ''It's a quid pro quo,'' she said. ''Pay up and get cops you can see on the street.''
The Mayor's program hinges on two revenue sources - the payroll tax and a surcharge on lottery tickets - that require legislative approval in Albany and one - increased property taxes - that must be approved by the City Council. But those approvals may be hard to come by. The Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, said the crime package went well beyond what Council members envisioned. And in the Republican-controlled State Senate, the majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, said he supported the strategy of putting more officers on the street, but not the Mayor's plan to pay for them.
''We don't want any part of a tax on commuters,'' said Mr. Marino, a Republican from Muttontown, L.I., ''and a payroll tax would certainly impact on commuters and small-business people and moderate-income people who've already been hit. The lottery proposal on its face seems to have some built-in problems. People will simply buy their tickets outside the city, because it will be cheaper.''
 
Timing Lamented
Some economists say the Mayor's timing could not be worse, for he finds himself facing higher expectations at a time of lower revenues.
''The economic downturn is occurring just when the appetite for public services is increasing,'' said Mitchell Moss of the Urban Research Center and New York University. ''Dinkins is being blamed, but drugs and crime did not start in 1990, and so there's a dilemma. He's trying to add taxes. If the economy were growing, he wouldn't have to do that; the revenue surplus would fund it.''
The Federal budget package may help, however. ''Nondollar currencies are doing very well right now,'' Mr. Moss said, ''and New York is getting hurt because the national economy is hurt by the value of the dollar declining relative to other currencies. High interest rates make it difficult to finance things, which New York is a world capital for. So if the national economy gets better, we do better.''
 
Where the Grass Isn't Greener
But if things get worse, Mr. Moss said, one bit of conventional wisdom no longer holds.
''New Yorkers can thank God Jim Florio is across the river because he was first to raise taxes, so the old theory, move to New Jersey, doesn't work any more,'' Mr. Moss said. ''We're in a better position comparatively because New Jersey has established a much higher personal income tax.''
But Ms. Scanlon - shunning the view that calls for less taxation, less spending and less government - contended that local officials may have to be more accountable in the 1990's than ever before, particularly if more tax increases turn out to be necessary. ''The public is growing up,'' she said. ''I think it's the dawn of an awareness that says, How are we spending our public money? Are we taxing enough?''

HEADLINE: DINKINS ON CRIME;
City Hall's Program: Daring Agenda With Great Risks and No Guarantees

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins has done what few public officials have dared to do: Decided to fight crime through a challenging mix of policing and social-policy objectives that have eluded achievement for years. And he has vowed to pay for them.
That signals both the boldness of the Mayor's proposals and the big financial and political risks involved, especially in an uncertain economy. Mr. Dinkins has committed his city to a program that would end up driving its priorities for years, but whose success is deeply in doubt.
What the Mayor has done is nothing less than carve out a chunk of the city's $28 billion budget as a separate system all its own. Although much smaller, it could end up subordinating much of the rest because it would have special financing and no longer compete with other needs on equal terms. 
The real question is whether by moving such an important act so prominently out of the main tent Mr. Dinkins will have created a showpiece or an unwieldy white elephant doomed to collapse of its own weight and ambition.
 
'Risk Worth Taking'
''I suppose one could argue that it is a risk,'' Mr. Dinkins said yesterday, as he announced the plan on live television, with his commissioners and highest ranking police chiefs arrayed behind him along a bank of flags in the Board of Estimate chamber at City Hall. ''But it is a risk worth taking.''
Certainly the program he announced with fanfare went well beyond hiring the thousands of additional police officers that other politicians called for after a number of children were killed in August by bullets intended for others.
Then, Mr. Dinkins's low-key response to concern over crime threatened to undermine his credibility on all other issues. Now, he has offered a plan that would cost $1.8 billion over the next four years and finance everything from youth employment to after-school sports and music programs to building 3,000 new jail beds and providing sensitivity training for the police and prosecutors who deal with the aged.
It would do so through a mix of taxes, the bulk dedicated solely to that program, rejecting the advice of many business leaders and fiscal experts and countering the previously expressed inclinations of his own administration that such special taxes set a bad precedent.
 
'Root Causes'
Senior mayoral aides said Mr. Dinkins made the decision to reserve the taxes for his crime program in just the last few days, in an attempt to win the political support necessary to pass a new payroll tax and a lottery surcharge in the State Legislature and real-estate taxes in the City Council. Some lawmakers have indicated that they and their constituents would be more willing to support taxes if they could guarantee that they would be used to fight crime.
At the same time, by including initiatives to address what he often calls the ''root causes'' of crime - poverty, unemployment, undereducation - Mr. Dinkins sought to guarantee that if lawmakers wanted more police officers, they would have to come as part of a package leavened with the Mayor's own causes, too.
The Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone, yesterday had the air of a man presented with far more than he had expected when the Council called for hiring more officers. But he acknowledged that the plan was stuctured ''rather cleverly'' for gathering maximum political support.
Borough President Ruth W. Messinger of Manhattan said: ''It is a bold and dramatic initiative that recognizes that improving quality of life in this city is about a lot more than just cops. It takes two known facts, a tough budget situation and a clear set of needs, and tries to say that we have to take steps forward, whatever the other consequences.''
 
Series of Unknowns
But the plan is as remarkable for its uncertainties as for its convictions. Besides the new taxes, which would enable the city to pay for its share of the cost, the Mayor acknowledged that the state alone would have to bear the cost of building five or six new long-term prisons to handle the expected additional inmates.
In subtler ways, too, the plan depends on imponderables. Can the Byzantine and entrenched police bureaucracy use the thousands of additional officers to adapt itself to a radically different approach to crime-fighting, in which officers would take a more active role in communities and more responsibilities for finding solutions on their own shoulders?
The plan commits the city to working with senior court officials to move felony cases through the system more quickly, but it does not specify how it will do so. Senior city officials conceded that is because no one yet knows.
Can added programs to provide summer jobs for teen-agers, fight drug abuse and add probation case-workers keep young people at risk from slipping into crime? Can large numbers of black and Hispanic men and women be recruited to join the police force, to diversify its ranks, and can more college students be encouraged to become police cadets in exchange for scholarships?
 
Possible Wage and Hiring Freeze
Perhaps most seriously, with the city facing a projected budget gap for the fiscal year that starts next July, facing cutbacks in its capital building programs for roads and bridges and parks and facing potentially costly labor settlements with its work force - whose labor contracts are expiring - can it really afford the police now?
And what will it do in the annual budget cycle next spring to finance the cost of continuing programs? Mr. Dinkins acknowledged that immediate contingency plans for wage and hiring freezes were being prepared.
Allen J. Proctor, executive director of the State Financial Control Board, which was set up to monitor the city's financesin the wake of the fiscal crisis of the mid-70's, said the criminal justice plan must be considered in light of overall budget needs.
''The fundamental purpose of the financial plan process was to force the city to do all of its budget-making in a comprehensive, multi-year framework,'' he said. ''The big unanswered question is where is the comprehensive, multi-year framework for 1992, when the bulk of these costs would occur?''
First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel acknowledged the concerns about financing. But he said: ''It's quite clear that those who say it should be absorbed within the city's budget are not being realistic. It's just an enormous gulp, given the kind of retrenchment we're going to have to have to have a balanaced budget next year.''
''We think we can get the funding for this,'' he added, ''rather than getting it down the road for general budget-balancing purposes. If we don't get the funding, I don't know how we're going to accommodate even any significant portions of it.''

For Berkeley, Diversity Means Many Splinters

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif., Oct. 2

 BODY:
The University of California at Berkeley last year became the first major research university in the country to fully integrate its student body, in the sense that no single ethnic or racial group constitutes a majority.
But a recently completed study of campus life indicates there is far less mingling of cultures on the campus here than its rich ethnic and racial diversity might suggest.
Study sessions and parties, as well as student political, social and professional groups, tend to splinter along racial and ethnic lines. Groups like the Black Sociology Student Association and gatherings like all-Asian dances serve as a source of strength for minority students, the report said, but are also obstacles to cross-racial relationships. 
As a result, the campus is Balkanized, reported the 23 Berkeley social scientists who did the 16-month study, called the Diversity Project.
 
Asians Walk With Asians
''Watch students walk by,'' William Tell, 20 years old, a sophomore political science major, said recently. ''It's usually Asian students walking and talking with Asian students and whites with whites.''
Many students, especially those who said they came to Berkeley in search of diversity, expressed dismay about the way everything from sitting in a cafeteria to chatting between classes takes on a racial tone. ''All students have to figure out whom they are going to hang out with, but on this campus it becomes a racial question,'' the report observed.
''It's kind of awkward to go up to someone who's not of your race, and maybe doesn't speak your language, and say, 'Hey, would you like to associate with me on a day-to-day basis?' '' said Mr. Tell.
The study, which involved interviews with 230 students, was requested 16 months ago by the university's chancellor, I. Michael Heyman, who retired in June. His replacement, Chang-Lin Tien, the first Asian-American to head a major research university in this nation, is now reviewing the report.
 
New Experience for Whites
The racial and ethnic enclaves that form at Berkeley enable students to discover or renew a sense of identity, and often perplex white students, who may find themselves a minority for the first time in their lives, the report said.
Some students say the racial or ethnic groupings are more pronounced in the first two years of undergraduate life, and that in later years, more friendships are formed across ethnic lines. Other students say whatever racial barriers exist at Berkeley are relatively slight and understandable.
Indro Chakrabarti, 19, a sophomore majoring in biochemistry, compared being a freshman at Berkeley to attending a United Nations meeting.
''If you saw someone from your own country there, you'd talk to that person before you talked to anyone else,'' said Mr. Chakrabarti. ''But everyone's clumped in the same situation and you can find a friend in anyone.''
Students interviewed for the Diversity Project said the backdrops for their most rewarding experiences with people of other backgrounds were activities without a racial focus, like sports teams, a band or a choir.
 
Tension Over Admissions
Project researchers also found that much of the tension and misunderstanding among ethnic groups on campus stemmed from a fiercely competitive admissions process.
In the last decade, Berkeley drastically altered the way it selected students, with the goal of someday reflecting California's diverse population in its student body. It has nearly attained this goal.
In the process, the percentage of white students at Berkeley dropped from 66 percent in 1980 to less than 45 percent last year. In the 1960's, the typical Berkeley student was white; today there is no typical Berkeley student.
Stories abound of black, American Indian or Hispanic students ''stealing'' spots at Berkeley from Asian or white students who scored higher on an academic index, the researchers found. And minority students complained that no matter how hard they worked, they would not be accepted as legitimate students by classmates.
''I feel like I have 'affirmative action' stamped on my forehead,' '' said one black student who was interviewed for the project.
Better understanding of Berkeley's admissions policy would help break down racial and ethnic barriers, the researchers suggested.
 
Importance of Diversity
The median grade point average of black and Hispanic freshmen was lower than the average of incoming whites and Asians, the report said. But whites and Asians with similarly high averages were turned away, regardless of the university policy of seeking diversity.
Troy Duster, the sociologist who led the Diversity Project, said the university should emphasize that in today's global economy, graduates who go on to become leaders must be capable of working with people of many backgrounds.
The report recommended the establishment of a freshman seminar in which small groups of students would meet monthly to discuss integration; giving all students and faculty a summary of Berkeley's admissions policy, and encouraging professors to force random groups of students to tackle problems together.

HEADLINE: Farmers Markets: Good for Growers, Shoppers and Cities

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
THE number of farmers' markets nationwide has almost doubled in the last decade, to 2,000 this year from 1,200 in 1980, according to Public Markets Collaborative, a group that works to establish and preserve markets.
Massachusetts had six markets in the mid-1970's; it has 85 this year. California had just one market 15 years ago; today there are 140. Greenmarket farmers in New York City took in at least $9 million last year, said Barry Benepe, a planning consultant who founded Greenmarket in 1976. There are now 18 sites in New York, with an estimated 40,000 shoppers a week. 
American Demographics magazine estimates that consumers will spend $1 billion to $2 billion to buy fresh food directly from 200,000 farmers this year; that includes roadside stands and other outlets as well as farmers' markets.
Farmers' markets are urban or suburban sites where growers bring fresh food and sell directly to consumers. They are supported by local or state governments or by nonprofit organizations, and are set up for many reasons: to support family farms, revitalize downtowns, or provide fresh, inexpensive food to urban residents.
When Lynn Bagley started four markets in Northern California, she said, she was primarily interested in nutrition. ''But you quickly find out,'' she said, ''that what you're really doing is supporting the small farmer, and in the long run helping maintain a regional food belt.''
In a study, Robert Sommer, director of the Center for Consumer Research at the University of California at Davis, found that people shop at farmers' markets for high-quality food, lower prices and atmosphere, in that order.
August Schumacher, commissioner of Food and Agriculture in Massachusetts, said: ''In the old days people went to the dump; now they go to the farmers' market. It's become a big social event.''
The markets in New York City range from the sprawling Union Square market - where, Mr. Benepe (pronounced BEN-i-pee) said, a grower can take in as much as $10,000 a day - to one on the Lower East Side that attracts six farmers once a week. Farmers pay less than 5 percent of their gross sales for their stalls, he said.
All year, every Wednesday, Friday and Saturday, dozens of growers do business at Union Square Park in Manhattan, and provide ample atmosphere amid fragrant stalks of basil, cooking demonstrations, tours and tastings.
One recent day shoppers could choose white eggplant, cider, peaches, apples, okra, sour cherries, squash blossoms, raspberries, eggs, chickens, bursting sunflowers, and apple and blueberry pies.
Growers first came to the greenmarkets ''with great skepticism,'' Mr. Benepe said, adding: ''They feared they'd come with full loads and go home with empty pockets. Rip-off city.''
Elizabeth Ryan farms 35 acres in Staatsburg, N.Y., in the Hudson River Valley. ''Running a farm is very grueling and very demanding,'' she said. ''There are times you feel discouraged. And the thing that really makes it worth it, honestly, it's such a shot in the arm to get in that truck and go to market on Saturday and know that it's all worthwhile.''
She says the importance of the markets is more than economic. ''It makes you take what you do very seriously,'' she said. ''You see the people who buy your food, you see the people who put it in bottles and feed it to their baby.''
And for consumers, studies show that prices are 5 to 30 percent lower at farmers' markets, where there are no middlemen and transportation costs are low.
Without the markets, many family farms - too small to comply with demands for volume and uniformity of wholesale distributors - would be forced to sell out. In response to a Greenmarket survey, 70 percent of its farmers said the market was either essential or important to their economic well-being, Mr. Benepe said.
In Connecticut, the nonprofit Hartford Food System found that farmers could not afford to run markets in the poorest neighborhoods. So it linked up with neighborhood organizations, bought food from farmers and opened farm stands, said Mark Winne, the organization's executive director.
Connecticut is also one of 10 states in the Federal Farmers' Market Coupon program. Last year some 275,000 poor women and children were issued coupons worth $2.5 million. Many farmers also accept food stamps. The markets, in turn, can help a city. A twice-weekly market saved downtown Pasco, Wash., said Linda Sue Williams of the Pasco Downtown Development Association. Seventy farmers use a lot where in the last five years the city has built 48 shelters for growers and their food. Three thousand to 5,000 people shop there each week, she said.
''It's been credited by many, many people with saving the downtown,'' Ms. Williams said. ''It's the best thing that's happened to Pasco in a long, long time.''

HEADLINE: WINE TALK

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial

 BODY:
FOR a few days, it looked as if the scare was over. A large amount of imported wine, mostly French, had been held up by American health authorities because it contained traces of a chemical fungicide not approved for use in the United States by the Environmental Protection Agency.
But top American officials had acknowledged publicly that the fungicide, procymidone, was not about to hurt anyone. Though wine that almost certainly contained the chemical was already in shops, the authorities had not even bothered to recall it.
''People shouldn't worry about this,'' the E.P.A. Administrator, William K. Reilly, told The Wall Street Journal. ''I intend myself not to worry about it.'' 
In short, a lot of feathers had been ruffled, but no one expected any serious problems.
That's not the way it worked out. The E.P.A. denied the European Community's request for a temporary ruling releasing the blocked wine, and said its review of the matter would probably take a year.
''Based on a preliminary assessment of the limited data now available,'' the agency said in a statement on Sept. 21, ''E.P.A. does not believe the levels of procymidone detected in imported wines pose a health risk.'' But it added that until ''a permissible residue'' was established, the Food and Drug Administration would monitor and detain wines with detectable residues of the product.
Procymidone was found in 75 of 678 samples of imported wine from France and Italy, or about 11 percent. But the E.P.A. estimates that as much as 20 percent of wine imported to the United States will be blocked, at a cost of about $150 million to the wine trade.
All that wine stacked in warehouses is going to stay there, right through the peak holiday buying season, when nearly half of all the French wine imported to the United States is sold. One major importer who did not want to be identified estimates that there may be 200,000 cases of wine detained. This does not include wine held back in France and Italy. In some cases, it's just an inconvenience. The 1988 and 1989 vintages of Bordeaux, for example, have yet to be shipped to the United States. Once these are approved for import - and no one seriously contends that they won't be - they will come to market unimpaired.
The 1988's were bottled this year and most have not been shipped abroad, yet. The 1989's won't be bottled until next year, and good Bordeaux should not be drunk for several years after bottling.
But good Bordeaux is only a small part of the wine exported to the United States. What will happen, for example, to the blocked 1989 Beaujolais?
Most Beaujolais is at its best in the year after the harvest. It will last for several years, but if the current E.P.A. timetable is maintained, the 1989 wine will be freed just as the 1990 vintage comes on the market. No procymidone was used on the grapes that went into the 1990 Beaujolais vintage, the first of which, Beaujolais nouveau, will arrive next month. So who will buy the year-old vintage, the vintage with traces of procymidone in it, when it is allowed on the market?
For importers of such wines, from both France and Italy, the economic effects of the extended ban could be serious. The United States market accounts for about 20 percent of France's wine imports.
Procymidone, used to control mold on grapes, has been available for 15 years and is used in 26 countries. Because the rot caused by mold is not a serious problem in this country, procymidone's manufacturer, Sumitomo Chemical Company of Osaka, Japan, says it never bothered to register the fungicide with the United States Government. It is also a relatively expensive fungicide, likely to be used by the largest and most profitable producers. Only last April, a month after traces of procymidone were first discovered in imported wine, did Sumitomo first petition the E.P.A. to establish a tolerance level. Had it done so earlier, the fungicide would probably have been approved by now. The company says high doses of procymidone can cause cancer in mice and rats, but only at levels far in excess of what a human could be expected to consume.
The World Health Organization and Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations did review procymidone in 1989, and said it could be safely consumed at a rate 10 times higher than the highest level found in imported wine in the United States.
The E.P.A.'s action drew a predictable response from American importers. The National Association of Beverage Importers said it was ''very disappointed,'' and warned of retaliation by the wine-producing countries. ''The consequences for European Economic Community wine exports to the U.S. may be very serious indeed,'' the importers said in a statement. ''Trade worth hundreds of millions of dollars is being disrupted. Yet we are convinced that with some flexibility on the part of the U.S. Administration, this situation might well have been averted.''
In Brussels, Ray MacSharry, the agricultural commissioner of the European Community, accused the E.P.A. of acting in bad faith. In a letter to Mr. Reilly, he noted that community officials, including its Ambassador to the United States, Andreas Van Agt, had met with officials of his agency several times to discuss the procymidone question.
''I was led to believe,'' Mr. MacSharry wrote, ''that the review process would be expedited, that alternatives would be explored to remedy the problem in the short term, that the commission would be updated on the situation and that it would be consulted before any decision was taken. It would appear that none of these assurances have been honored. Frankly, I am concerned about the decision you have chosen to take. I also very much regret the way it was taken, in that you did not see fit to update us on your thinking nor find it useful to consult us before adopting your final position.''
The French Minister of Agriculture, Henri Nallet, who came to Washington earlier this year to discuss the procymidone issue, was more succinct in his reaction to the EPA's decision to continue the ban. ''I was surprised because it did not correspond to the explanations given to me by the authorities with whom I met in the United States,'' he told Reuters in Paris. ''I can only say that a commitment that was made to me has been broken.''
The wine importers have enlisted some powerful legislative support. Prompted by Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, Republican of New York, the Senate Appropriations Committee directed the E.P.A. to work with the Food and Drug Administration to establish a ''realistic'' enforcement level for procymidone ''with deliberate speed.'' Similar language has been included in a report from the House Appropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the E.P.A.
The procymidone controversy recalls the bureaucratic furor last year when the Chilean fruit industry lost millions of dollars after traces of cyanide were discovered on a handful of imported grapes.
It recalls last year's European ban on American meat from cattle treated with hormones. In none of these cases - imported wine from Europe, imported grapes from Chile, exported beef from the United States - has the consumer been in danger.
More and more sophisticated tests find more and more traces of compounds that in larger quantities could be harmful. Can we eliminate all these substances? Should we want to? What about the toxic subtances that appear naturally in many things we eat and drink? What should public policy be?
 
TASTINGS
Quincy, Duc de Berri, 1989, Loire Valley; about $8. Sancerre was for many years the bistro white wine of Paris. At Allard, the renowned bistro on the Left Bank, Sancerre was as much a fixture as the waiters. Allard has fallen on hard times and Sancerre has become more and more expensive, in France and this country, too. Most Sancerres sell for around $12 here, but a few are pushing $20 a bottle, a ridiculous price for what is essentially a bistro wine. Fortunately, help is at hand. Just a few kilometers from the town of Sancerre is the village of Quincy. Both towns produce good white wines from the sauvignon blanc grape. In many instances, the only difference in the two wines is the price. Both both have a fresh, tart, slightly vegetal taste that make them perfect companions for all kinds of fish. Quincy wine is not easy to find. Not that much is made, and wine retailers, never having heard of it, are wary. Get to know it before it's discovered. Sauvion and Pipet are two other Quincy producers whose wines are seen in this country, but this one is a particularly good buy.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Stocks In Biggest One-Day Rise

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Reports of an easing in Persian Gulf tensions and intervention by the Government sent the stock market here exploding upward on Tuesday for its largest one-day gain, a 13.2 percent increase on the Nikkei average.
Tokyo stocks fell back a bit in the opening minutes of trading this morning, with the Nikkei off nearly 200 points after 20 minutes of trading.
Tuesday's euphoric surge was set off by an unexpected convergence of positive factors, including a big jump on Wall Street on Monday. In New York on Tuesday, stocks retreated a bit, with the Dow off 10.64, at 2,505.20. [Page D10.] In Tokyo, Tuesday's big rise still left the market down sharply for the year, and few said they expected the exaggerated, one-way movement to continue for long. 
 
Nine-Month Slump
But it brought a welcome respite from a nine-month slump that had wiped out nearly half the value of the Japanese share market and had threatened the health of the banking system.
''The important thing was that finally investors were convinced that the market has a bottom,'' said Toshio Mori, the executive vice president of the Tokyo Securities Company. ''It will still take a while for the market to stabilize, but it was an important day psychologically.''
The closely watched Nikkei index of 225 issues shot up from the opening of trading and hardly stopped, soaring by 2,676.55 points, or by 13.2 percent, to 22,898.41. That brought the index only back to where it stood a week ago, when it was being battered by higher interest rates and worries about a war in the Middle East.
Today's upswing, comparable to a rise of more than 300 points in the Dow Jones industrial average, was greater than the 9.3 percent rise after the stock market crashed in October 1987.
In addition, market-determined interest rates fell sharply, another plus for the Tokyo market. The yield on the Japanese Government's benchmark 10-year bond tumbled to 8.245 percent, from 8.54 percent, also a record one-day move.
 
Many Buy Orders
But the stock market was so clogged with buy orders that it barely functioned most of the day. This, analysts said, made the increase somewhat artificial.
In fact, the Tokyo Stock Exchange said by midday, nearly a third of the issues on its first section had been unable to trade because not enough sellers were available to match with buyers. By the end of the day, almost 10 percent of the shares on the exchange had still not opened because of the imbalances, sharply reducing the amount of trading that could be done.
The situation was even worse in the increasingly important market for stock-index futures contracts, whose rules restrict how much the contracts can rise or fall in a day. Unable to cope, the market never opened, and not a single transaction could take place; by the end of the day, there were 114,000 orders to buy the index contracts, and 4 to sell, none of which were executed, the traders said.
 
Several Factors
Market experts attributed the sudden flood of buy orders to three principal factors: a steep decline in oil prices, touched off by signs the Persian Gulf crisis might be resolved through diplomatic means; the agreement in the United States to lower the Federal budget deficit, which has sent shivers of hope through trading rooms from Wall Street to Tokyo of a decline in interest rates, and a new attitude expressed by Japan's Finance Minister late on Monday, in which he said the Government would act to halt the market's earlier plunge.
''It was a complete change in tone by the Government, after it ignored the markets for months,'' said Toyoharu Tsutsui, the head of the equity department at CS First Boston. ''That really gave a lot of impetus to things.''
A sign of the urgency that had been felt here came on Monday when the Finance Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, announced several symbolic market-bolstering measures.
He increased the amount investors could borrow against the value of their stock to buy new shares, to 80 percent, from 70 percent, and raised the limits on how much large institutions could invest in little-regulated special stock funds, called tokkin, to 7 percent of their assets, from 5 percent. Mr. Hashimoto also shortened slightly the hours during which stock-index futures and options could be traded here. The last measure reaffirmed an earlier statement.
The Finance Minister also reversed a comment made just a few days ago in which he denied that a huge jump in interest rates had contributed to the market's decline; he hinted that the Government would consider pushing rates lower if the market continued to plummet, recognition that the doubling of rates by the Government in the last year had played a role.
 
'Just Symbols'
''What he announced was just symbols; it had no substantial impact by itself,'' said Kazuhiko Hama, a senior executive in the equity department at the Nomura Securities Company. ''But it showed that he was not unaware of our situation, and that he would consider changing monetary policy if things in the market got too bad. It was psychological, but that's important.''

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Continue To Tumble

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
Crude oil, gasoline and heating oil prices continued to tumble yesterday in futures trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Traders said the drop was a further reaction to conciliatory remarks on Monday by President Bush and President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, and the result of heavy selling by speculative traders who bought oil near $40 a barrel and are now fearful of further losses.
Crude for November delivery fell $3.14 a barrel, to $33.95, bringing the drop for the last two days to $5.56, or 14.1 percent. Gasoline for November delivery fell 6.98 cents a gallon, to 86.93 cents, while November heating oil was down 8 cents, to 92.03 cents a gallon. Gasoline and heating oil for delivery this winter and next spring fell the limit of 4 cents a gallon, while oil contracts of similar maturities dropped the limit of $1.50 a barrel. 
''The market is barometric, it's anticipatory, and there's less of a threat of a war right now,'' said Michael Wilner, the president of the Hilltop Trading Company, a trading and brokerage company on the floor of the Merc. He cited President Bush's speech at the United Nations on Monday, in which the President said he hoped for a diplomatic solution to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
 
'Panicky Liquidation'
Not all of yesterday's fall in futures prices was directly tied to diminished tensions in the Middle East, said Peter C. Beutel, an oil market analyst at Pegasus Econometric Group Inc., a consulting firm in Hoboken, N.J. ''We saw some panicky liquidation as some people who bought high began to get nervous,'' he said.
Only a tiny fraction of the oil actually used in the United States is traded on the Merc. But futures prices matter because they determine the cash price at which cargoes of crude and refined products actually change hands.
While the oil futures market was fairly busy yesterday, few cargoes were traded, said Andrew B. Shasha, an energy broker at Star Supply Inc. in Englewood, N.J. ''People get shellshocked and re-evaluate their positions'' during a sudden drop in prices, he added.
After the close of trading, the American Petroleum Institute, a Washington group, announced that the nation's stocks of crude oil decreased by 9.4 million barrels last week, to 354.6 million barrels.

HEADLINE: One Big Store's Recession Jitters

BYLINE: By N. R. KLEINFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EAST BRUNSWICK, N.J.

 BODY:
As an early morning drizzle began falling on the parking lot, William Senn, the manager of the big J. C. Penney store here, began another nervous day of coping with consumer lassitude. He scolded an employee to restore a vanished sale sign in a display window -Who knew how many lost customers that could mean? After leafing through a report, he told a buyer she had ordered far too many black gloves for women and must cancel some.
Around the country, department store managers like Mr. Senn are watching such things very closely these days, as they stand uneasily at the front lines of the looming recession. Consumer frugality is thick in the air and has cast its shadow all over his J. C. Penney store here in central New Jersey. Mr. Senn sees it in a falloff of big-ticket sales of furniture and nonessentials, like draperies. And he sees it in dwindling customer traffic not only in his store but throughout the Brunswick Square Mall, where his store is situated.
Consumer confidence in the economy, as indicated by various national measures, plunged steeply in August. Retail sales throughout the nation have been weak for a long time, especially in the New York area. The prospect of war in the Middle East, soaring oil prices, threats of accelerated inflation - all are conspiring to scare people from spending. 
Many economists and Bush Administration officials say there is no clear evidence that a recession has started. There is also no consensus on how close one may be. But the ramifications of shoppers' jitters are rippling through the strips of stores that line downtown streets and the shopping malls that blanket highway exits. That means heavy pressure on store managers like Mr. Senn to work more strenuously and to think more imaginatively to get the cash registers to ring again.
So heading for the main selling floor, Mr. Senn offered broad smiles and peppy words to sales clerks to try to prop up spirits. As he navigated his way down the aisles, his eyes danced over the merchandise displays. When he spied a regular customer, he blurted out a roisterous greeting: ''Hey, will you look at who's here! Now come say hello.''
Ranked 38th in sales among the 1,330 Penney department stores, Mr. Senn's store is far from the worst hit. His store's sales rose 8.5 percent this year through July, better than the 4.4 percent achieved collectively by the Penney chain but below the average of more than 10 percent that the store has registered over the last five years.
But recent weeks have been starkly grimmer. Sales tumbled 9 percent in August, usually a robust back-to-school sales period. Along with February, August is one of the two traditionally strong months for furniture sales. But those sales alone plummeted a jarring 15 percent in August. Mr. Senn was hindered because two seasoned furniture sales people were out, but customers seemed to be postponing whatever purchases they could. Draperies are down. Children's clothing has declined.
Mr. Senn's store was also hampered by a new mall opening in nearby Freehold at the beginning of August, but the economy also played a pivotal role.
 
Service Is Stressed
Faced with customer thriftiness, Mr. Senn, a spunky, sandy-haired man, has been flogging his staff to new heights of assertiveness.
''We're trying to give more service,'' Mr. Senn said. ''When a customer is in the store, we want to positively interact with that customer and raise the average purchase to make up for having less traffic. We want to sell them a whole wardrobe rather than half a wardrobe. I tell our people to sell more aggressively. More smiles. More service.'' Recession, as it happens, is not part of Mr. Senn's vocabulary. ''I don't know the word,'' he said. ''The sales help read enough about it in the press and see it on TV. I never say it to anyone.''
How could he? After all, Mr. Senn is a merchant, and so he talks optimism while pessimism is shaking him by the shirt collar. He says he hopes to see 4 to 5 percent sales growth for the vital Christmas selling period, when 35 percent of the store's annual sales are rung up. He hopes to finish the year with sales of $36 million, a modest 5 percent ahead of 1989. Yet, like all retailers, he secretly knows circumstances could make this one of the most harrowing Christmases in years.
Out on the selling floor, footsteps were sporadic. Sales clerks were idle much of the time. The customers who strayed in seemed loath to touch their wallets.
One shopper, Suzanne Ramsey-Restivo, was fingering some blouses while doing her best to keep her 7-month-old son, brimming with innocent energy, from excessive squalling.
 
'I Just Look'
''Oh yeah, we're cutting back,'' she said. ''My husband works for an electrical system estimating company and there's not much going on in that business. We have the baby now and I don't work. Most of the time I just look. But the prices today just boggle me. There are shorts over there that I paid $20 for and they're marked down to $2.99 now. How could they have been marked up so much?''
Another shopper, Margo Shephard, a retired schoolteacher. said: ''I'm not buying anything. Before, I saw something and said, 'O.K., get it.' I need a winter coat like crazy and I've postponed getting it. They're asking a ridiculous amount of money. I just gave one to the thrift shop and I should have kept it another year. I see $70 for a skirt and I say, 'C'mon, what is this? A bank robbery?' ''
Stan Zibbe, a veteran salesman in men's suits, said: ''The customer will buy when the sale is on, that's their prime consideration. Again and again, customers ask me, 'When's the next sale?' ''
 
A Student of Prices
One particularly vivid sign of the times was the wooden-faced woman looking through handbags. She clutched a large index card on which she was scratching down prices. She had the numbers at Macy's, Lord & Taylor, Sears. Now she was recording Penney's prices. ''When I get all my numbers, then I study them,'' she confided. ''Only then do I buy. When you shop at a time like this you don't just buy. You become a student of prices. I'm here getting a degree in handbag pricing.''
After 27 years at Penney's, Mr. Senn accepts hard times as an occupational hazard. A career Penney man, he was still in high school when he landed a part-time job sweeping floors in the Youngstown, Ohio, store. He graduated to the stock room and, once college was behind him, began the trudge up the managerial ranks. For the last six years, he has run the East Brunswick store, and he has received plaudits from corporate headquarters for his proficiency.
Penney store managers get a lot of autonomy. Most final buying decisions are made locally.
''So I take full responsibility for whatever goes right or wrong in my store,'' Mr. Senn said. ''It all comes back to me.''
He has initiated several steps to chop costs and spur sales. A half-dozen people were cut from sales support areas. Earlier this year, a computerized system was installed to manage the heating and cooling systems of the store to save on energy.
 
Novel Promotions
He pays acute attention to seemingly minor details, knowing they assume exaggerated importance when customers are already hesitant. When he tours the mall perimeter, he is on the lookout for untidiness. He has recently berated mall management for dead shrubs and fading parking stripes. ''It's the little things that matter,'' he said.
At the same time, he and his staff have worked on novel ideas to entice shoppers. In November, the store will stage a women's coat trade-in. For one week, customers who bring in an old coat will get a $10 certificate toward a new coat. The discards will be donated to the needy.
Determined to lure all the business he can, Mr. Senn visits the competition to assimilate fresh ideas. Penney's nationally has worked to upgrade its fashion image in recent years and Mr. Senn is always alert to notions that will aid the transformation.
His main worry is Macy's, which stands at the far end of the mall. Mr. Senn addictively roams through its floors every workday, buying nothing but soaking up information. ''Let's go take a look,'' he said.
As he strolled through the eerily empty Macy's, his eyes were working hard. ''Look at all their support bras,'' he said. ''We ran a promotion last month because Macy's has all these support bras. But, guess what, they have too many spring colors now.''
At dresses, he said: ''What they are really good at is their visual merchandising. You don't see any empty cases. Everywhere you look you see merchandise. I give them accolades for that. At Penney's, we don't understand this. But we're learning.''
Back in his own store, Mr. Senn insisted he would continue to take risks. He paused at women's slippers and said: ''We are No. 1 in slippers among all the Penney stores. No one is close to me. Because I understand slippers. You have to know what people want - what brands, what colors. And you have to be gutsy. I bought a lot of slippers. Whatever's going on, you have to show some guts.''

Cleaner Air, Cooler Air

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
COULD taxes on carbon dioxide emissions stop atmospheric warming that threatens to flood coastlines and turn farmland to desert? Perhaps, concludes a study released last month by the Congressional Budget Office. But even in the best of plausible worlds, taming the global economy's addiction to carbon fuels would cost trillions of dollars.
That does not necessarily mean the price would not be worth paying. But the budget office does counsel a hard look at two strategies: containing emissions of other ''greenhouse effect'' gases, or learning to cope in a warmer environment. 
Some air pollutants, notably carbon dioxide from burning oil, gas and coal, help to trap heat from the sun. And while there is no consensus on the rate of warming or the likely environmental damage, hardly anyone is eager to play Russian roulette with the biosphere.
Western Europe is pressing Washington for a commitment to reduce carbon emissions to 1988 levels, and then roll them back another 20 percent in future decades. The least intrusive way to reach the goal, economists believe, is through carbon charges - taxes on fuels in proportion to the amount of carbon dioxide they release.
The budget office used a variety of computer models to simulate the effect of a $100-a-ton carbon charge, equivalent to $13 for a barrel of oil, phased in over the next decade. It found that the $100 charge would indeed induce a lot of fuel conservation. Equally important, it would encourage industry to fire its boilers with natural gas, which emits roughly half as much carbon dioxide for each unit of heat as coal. By the year 2000 carbon emissions would be somewhere between 5 percent less and 6 percent more than emissions in 1988.
But the likely price, $100 billion a year in reduced output for the American economy alone, would be nothing to sneeze at. And after the year 2000, the task of holding the line on emissions would be increasingly problematic.
Under one cheerful scenario, based on the computer model used by the Environmental Protection Agency, engineering would save the day. Advances in energy-conserving technologies - efficiencies apart from those induced by rising fuel prices -would permit America to roll back carbon emissions at a continuing sacrifice of just 1 percent of the gross national product.
But this would only be possible if the amount of energy required to generate a dollar's worth of output fell by 1.5 percent annually. And research by Dale Jorgensen, an economist at Harvard, suggests that is far too optimistic. Without conservation induced by higher oil prices, Mr. Jorgensen calculates, Americans would actually be using more energy for each unit of output than they did in the 1970's.
Two other researchers, Alan Manne at Stanford and Richard Richels at the Edison Electric Institute, offer an intermediate path. Assuming gains in energy efficiency of half a percent annually, their simulations suggest that energy demand could not be met without a switch to non-carbon fuels - nuclear, solar and the like. The tax needed to induce the transition, they calculate, would run to about $50 a barrel. And the resulting drag on productivity would reduce the G.N.P. by 3 percent.
Confronted by such awesome costs - $300 billion annually by midcentury - some economists speculate that it would make sense to learn to live in the greenhouse. Thomas Schelling of Harvard suggests that the trillions of dollars needed to keep the atmosphere cool might be better spent on dikes, irrigation and air-conditioning.
The budget office suggests another approach: Other greenhouse gases, notably chemicals known as CFC's that are used in refrigeration and plastics, might be restricted first. CFC's are already high on the environmentalists' hit list because they destroy the protective atmospheric ozone layer. A crash program to eliminate them would be more cost-effective than attacking carbon dioxide.
Daniel Dudek, Alice LeBlanc and Peter Miller, analysts for the Environmental Defense Fund, offer a variation on the same theme. Sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants stunt wildlife and may eventually reduce crop yields. And one way or another sulfur emissions must be reduced. Regulation that encouraged utilities to switch to natural gas rather than to ''scrub'' the offending chemical from coal smoke would serve as a double whammy, reducing carbon emissions as well as sulfur.
Such incentives are, in fact, part of the amendments to the Clean Air Act now grinding their way through Congress. Passage of the bill may thus prove to be the most practical attack on the greenhouse effect to emerge this year from Washington.

G.E. Planning 500 Layoffs

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky., Oct. 2

 BODY:
The General Electric Company said today that it would eliminate up to 500 jobs at its giant manufacturing complex here by the end of the year because of the weakening economy.
The Fairfield, Conn., conglomerate said the indefinite layoffs are based on projections that United States sales of big appliances are down 5 percent this year. G.E. said it expected sales in 1991 to drop by another 3 percent to 5 percent. 
The layoffs represent a 6 percent cutback in the hourly work force of 9,000 at the Louisville complex, which also has a salaried staff of 2,000.
 
Industry analysts said that
G.E. has some 30 percent of the United States market for big appliances and that its main competitor, Whirlpool, has a similar share.
The company's stock dropped 50 cents a share today, to $55.75, on the New York Stock Exchange, where its volume of almost 2.5 million shares was the second busiest of the day.

USX Steel's New Head Sees Steady Demand

BYLINE: By JONATHAN HICKS

 BODY:
In spite of the widespread predictions of a recession, Thomas J. Usher says the USX Corporation has not yet seen any noticeable slowdown in its steel business. Nonetheless, Mr. Usher, who was named president of the Pittsburgh-based company's steel unit last week, said that in his new role as head of the nation's largest steel producer he would continue to press for the kind of cost-cutting efforts that have helped USX become one of the lowest-cost producers in the country.
''I would have to say in all honesty that while some of our customers are apprehensive, their businesses are still strong,'' said Mr. Usher, who had been executive vice president for heavy products since 1986. 
Mr. Usher, 42 years old, replaces Thomas C. Graham, who was named to the newly created position of vice chairman for USX's steel and diversified operations. Many in the industry speculated that the appointment of Mr. Usher paves the way for an orderly transition once Mr. Graham, who is 63, reaches the mandatory retirement age of 65.
Mr. Usher, who spent his career working in the steel operations of the company, comes to the helm as USX prepares for what many analysts predict will be a difficult negotiation period with the United Steelworkers of America, whose contract expires in January. Moreover, he will lead the business at a time when manufacturers are turning away from steel to substitute lighter materials.
Mr. Usher holds an undergraduate degree in industrial engineering, a master's degree in operations research and a doctorate in systems engineering from the University of Pittsburgh. After joining the company in 1966, Mr. Usher held a variety of positions. He was named assistant to the president of the steel division in 1981. By 1984, he was named vice president of engineering and for the steel business and was promoted a year later to senior vice president.

HEADLINE: Foreign Depositors Covered by F.D.I.C. at Failed Bank

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, treading carefully in a nervous financial market, acted recently to protect foreign depositors of a failed Washington bank from loss. While the move followed an established policy of extending deposit insurance to cover dollars held in overseas branches of American banks, the F.D.I.C. stopped short of pledging that it would always do so.
Still, the nation's largest banks, reeling from a lack of investor confidence that has sent their corporate stocks and bonds to near record lows, welcomed the action as helping to ward off a possible flight by worried foreign depositors.
The largest holders of foreign bank deposits include all of the nation's 10 largest banks, several of which have been buffeted by rumors of financial problems after a report last month by the General Accounting Office said 35 banks were likely to fail. 
 
The Decision to Cover
The 35 troubled banks, which were not identified, have total assets of only $45.1 billion, so they could not have included any of the nation's 10 largest, the smallest of which, Chemical Bank, based in New York, had assets of $45.5 billion at the end of 1989.
The decision to cover $37 million in a Nassau, Bahamas, branch of the National Bank of Washington was disclosed by bank regulators in a letter by Paul G. Fritts, director of bank supervision at the F.D.I.C., to Kenneth A. Guenther, executive director of the Independent Bankers Association of America. It was first reported publicly late last week by The American Banker.
Mr. Fritts said the decision ''was made after considering the risk of adverse systematic effects'' on foreign deposits of large American banks. In theory, the deposit insurance corporation promises to cover up to $100,000 per individual account held in any insured bank, that is, any bank that pays it the insurance premiums. That does not formally include money foreign depositors place in overseas branches of American banks. In practice, the F.D.I.C. has routinely covered accounts of more than $100,000 and those held by foreigners overseas.
 
Small Banks Opposed
The small banks Mr. Guenther represents have long opposed extending deposit insurance to foreign deposits. Most small banks have no significant overseas accounts and the banks that do are not required to pay additional insurance premiums to cover them. Assuming a deposit insurance premium of 19 cents per $100, large banks save more than $620 million a year by not paying insurance premiums on the $326.7 billion of foreign deposits they held at the end of March. Most large banks belong to the American Bankers Association, which supported the move.
In the case of National Bank of Washington, the F.D.I.C. rejected a staff proposal against extending the coverage. The staff said the foreign deposits should not be covered, as a way to reduce the costs to the United States Government of that bank's failure, and to remind foreign depositors to be vigilant in selecting banks.
But the Federal Reserve, according to William Seidman, the F.D.I.C. chairman, ''urged with great vehemence'' that the Government deposit insurance agency continue its established practice of protected foreign depositors from loss, even though those deposits are not legally insured. Afterward, Mr. Seidman and the other members of the F.D.I.C. board decided that the cheapest way to handle the failed bank was to sell its $1 billion of deposits and an equal amount of assets to the Riggs National Bank for $33 million.
 
Seidman's Position
By transfering all deposits, the F.D.I.C. avoided the contentious issue of saddling foreign depositors with a loss.
While Mr. Seidman favored backing foreign deposits at the National Bank of Washingon, he stopped short of promising F.D.I.C. backing for foreign depositors at other banks. Since the Government in effect covered the National Bank's domestic accounts above the insurance limit of $100,000 per account, he said it would be inappropriate to treat foreign depositors differently by not providing Government backing.
''As far as we can, we will treat all depositors the same,'' Mr. Seidman said. In cases where the F.D.I.C. cannot find any buyers of a failed bank, and decides to pay off deposits, Mr. Seidman left open the possibility that foreign depositors could bear a loss. When there is no buyer for a failed bank, the F.D.I.C.'s normal practice has been to pay domestic accounts up to the $100,000 insurance limit, and not pay foreign deposits. In practice, however, instances where the F.D.I.C. has not backed domestic accounts above the $100,000 limit ''have been as rare as hen's teeth'' said an F.D.I.C. spokesman, Alan Whitney, and have involved small banks that did not have foreign deposits.
 
Greenspan to Testify
The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, who is scheduled to testify on deposit insurance before a House subcommittee today, told Congress in September that the Fed opposes a policy that requires uninsured depositors to bear part of the loss of failed banks. He warned that there is a risk that withdrawls by foreign depositors could hurt the economy by forcing a sharp cutback in banks' lending and investing.
Other banking regulators have said that movements by foreign deposits could be a useful way of encouraging American banks to follow safer business practices, so long as deposit withdrawals are not sudden, and the Fed retains the power to bail out any bank necessary to maintain the safety and soundness of the fianancial system.

HEADLINE: Argentine Debt Payments

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
It may be two years before Argentina can increase what bankers consider token payments on its $67 billion foreign debt, President Carlos Saul Menem said on Monday in an interview in New York.
When asked if Argentina would yield to bankers' demands that it increase its $40 million monthly payments, Mr. Menem responded, ''not for the moment.'' 
Immediately after he took power in July 1989, Mr. Menem, who is 60 years old, opened up Argentina's economy and began an ambitious privatization drive, which included everything from telecommunications to roads.
His Government agreed earlier this year to resume monthly payments of $40 million. Creditor banks hold $47 billion of the country's debt.
But some bankers said at last month's annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank that Argentina was able to increase payments and that not doing so could result in a clash with banks.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Post Small Gains

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities posted only modest advances yesterday, despite another big drop in oil prices.
''Oil is down over $2 a barrel, but the long end of the market feels like it has sort of run into a wall,'' one trader of government bonds said early in the session.
Oil prices slid by another $1 later in the day, and closed at $33.95 a barrel, down $3.14 on the day.
Even with the drop in oil prices, some market participants said that interest rates, which have fallen steeply in recent days, were ripe for a period of consolidation or even a slight rise. 
''Yields on long-term bonds have fallen by 30 basis points over the last four days, so by all rights I figured the market would give some of that back or be unchanged,'' said James R. Capra, a senior vice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities.
 
Government Sales Ahead
Another factor limiting any yield declines for now is next week's auction of a new batch of medium- and long-term Government securities.
Late yesterday, the Resolution Funding Corporation, the Federal agency created to finance the bailout of the savings and loan industry, announced that it would sell $5 billion of new 30-year bonds on Oct. 11.
In when-issued trading late yesterday, the securities were offered at a price to yield 9.14 percent.
And today, the Treasury is expected to announce the size of a seven-year note auction it intends to hold next week.
Aside from watching oil prices, market participants and analysts spent part of the day interpreting yesterday's meeting of the Federal Reserve Board's policy-making Open Market Committee in Washington. With a proposal to cut the budget deficit now before Congress, many analysts have said that the Fed may move soon to lower short-term interest rates.
Many market participants said they were not expecting the Fed to conduct open market operations yesterday, so there was some surprise when the Fed added reserves to the banking system at a time when the rate for overnight bank loans in the Federal funds market was 8 3/16 percent.
The 8 percent level is widely considered to be the Fed's target for the Federal funds rate and most analysts concluded that the move, taken when the rate was above that, was not a signal that the central bank was about to ease monetary policy.
''The Fed did something similar last week, when funds were trading at about 8 1/4 percent,'' said Michael J. Moran, chief economist at Daiwa Securities America Inc. ''This was simply a signal that they did not want the funds rate to go any higher, not one where they were trying to push it lower.''
The Fed's move prompted much talk but little change in prices.
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 99 7/32, up 7/32, to yield 8.82 percent, compared with 8.84 percent late Monday.
 
Treasury Notes Rise
Among Treasury note issues, the 8 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 1/2, up 9/32, to yield 8.67 percent. And the 8 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 13/32, up 2/ 32, to yield 7.90 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were little changed to down slightly. In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.16 percent, unchanged from late Monday. Meanwhile, six-month bill rates dipped by 2 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to a late offered rate of 7.17 percent.
In the corporate bond market, the General Electric Credit Corporation priced a $250 million offering of two-year notes through an underwriting syndicate led by Kidder, Peabody & Company.
The 8 1/4 percent notes, which mature Oct. 1, 1992, were priced at $99.95 to yield 8.28 percent, 37.50 basis points higher than the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/8 percent two-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities, which are noncallable, are rated AAA by both Moody's Investors Service and the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
 
Scott Paper Issue
In addition, the Scott Paper Company offered $200 million of 9 3/4 percent seven-year notes.
The notes, which are noncallable, were priced at $99.85 to yield 9.78 percent, 1.20 percentage points higher than the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 1/2 percent seven-year notes at the time of pricing.
Salomon Brothers acted as lead underwriter for the offering, which is rated A-3 by Moody's and BBB+ by Standard & Poor's.
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, the Turnpike Authority of Kentucky priced an offering of $306 million of serial and term bonds.
The term bonds, which mature in 2007 and 2010, carry coupons of 7 3/4 percent and 7 1/4 percent, respectively, and were preliminarily priced to yield 7.55 percent and 7.60 percent.
Maturities on the serial bonds range from 1991 to 2005. On a preliminary basis, yields on these securities range from 6 percent in 1991 to 7.50 percent in 2005.
Merrill Lynch Capital Markets acted as lead manager for the negotiated underwriting. The securiites are rated A by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, traders said that prices of most issues were unchanged to up 1/8 point.
Participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal securities said that prices of most issues rose by 1/8 point to 1/4 point.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls in U.S. Trading; Gold, Off Overseas, Is Higher

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar dropped against all leading currencies in uneventful trading in the United States yesterday after moving mostly higher overseas.
Gold prices skidded on European and Asian markets. But gold gained modestly in the United States as the previous day's selloff here subsided. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for October delivery settled at $389.10 an ounce, up $2.50 from its close on Monday. The contract sank more than $15 on Monday. 
Currency dealers could not determine yesterday precisely why the dollar weakened in the United States. But they said volume was light, indicating sellers lacked conviction.
A widespread belief that American interest rates will eventually move lower in a weak economy was offered as a possible reason for the diminished demand for dollars.
Lower American interest rates would make returns on dollar-denominated holdings less appealing and could steer money into foreign investments with higher yields.
The chances that American rates will fall have risen since White House and Congressional negotiators reached agreement on a budget for the fiscal year 1991 over the weekend.
Another slide in oil prices yesterday helped ease inflation fears and also possibly curbed interest in dollars. The contract for November delivery tumbled $3.14 a barrel, to $33.95, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Unleaded gasoline and home-heating-oil prices also closed down sharply. If it continues, the decline in oil prices would give the Federal Reserve Board greater leeway to relax its monetary policy, lowering interest rates.
The dollar moved ahead against most foreign currencies in European trading. But earlier in Asia, the dollar lost ground.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.42 yen, to a closing 136.73 yen. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 137.00 yen. In New York, the dollar traded at 136.72 yen, down slightly from 136.75 yen late on Monday.
The British pound fetched $1.8890 late yesterday in London, the same as Monday's late rate. In New York, it cost $1.8930 to buy a pound, up from $1.8830 late on Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late on Monday, included: 1.5495 German marks, down from 1.55735; 1.2885 Swiss francs, down from 1.2960; 5.1915 French francs, down from 5.2195; 1,160.75 Italian lire, down from 1,167.25, and 1.15265 Canadian dollars, down from 1.153825.
In gold trading, the Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid of $389, $1.10 higher than Monday's late bid.
In London, gold traded at $388.75, compared with $395.25 late on Monday. In Zurich, the late bid was $388.60, down from $396.60. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $10.82 to close at $387.25.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET AGREEMENT;
Savings Seen as Less Than Predicted

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 2

 BODY:
Experts on the Federal budget said today that the deficit-reduction package announced Sunday would not save as much money as President Bush predicted, and they raised questions about the arithmetic used by the budget negotiators.
Mr. Bush said the package would save $500 billion over five years, including $40 billion this year.
Although budget estimates beyond one or two years are notoriously unreliable, a projected decline in spending outlined in the budget agreement appears to be particularly questionable.
 
Spending Decline Is Seen
Under the budget agreement, Federal spending would increase in the fiscal year 1991, which began this week. But the agreement envisions an $11 billion decline in total Federal spending, from $1,392 billion in the fiscal year 1992 to $1,381 billion in 1993. It then calls for a further decline of $38 billion, to $1,343 billion in 1994. 
The projected decline in spending would mark a striking change. Total Federal spending has not declined in any year since 1965.
Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company, who served as chief economist at the Office of Management and Budget from 1981 to 1983, said it was highly unrealistic to expect such a drop. ''To suggest that the level of total Federal spending will fall by $38 billion indicates that there is some hocus-pocus in these numbers,'' Mr. Kudlow said. ''I am becoming very suspicious that there is much less here than meets the eye.''
 
Too Modest for G.A.O. Chief
Comptroller General Charles A. Bowsher, the head of the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, said the deficit-reduction package, even if it achieved savings of $500 billion over five years, was ''considerably more modest than we believe necessary'' to maintain the health of the American economy and the United States' competitive position in the world.
The savings represent reductions from the level of Government spending needed to continue Federal operations at current levels, with an allowance for inflation but with no change in policy.
The Congressional Budget Office says the deficit for the fiscal year just ended will probably be the highest in American history, more than $220 billion, despite five years of supposed austerity and fiscal discipline under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law. The original law, signed by President Ronald Reagan in December 1985, said the Federal budget was supposed to be balanced in the fiscal year that began this week.
In 1987, Congress amended the law, deferring the goal of a balanced budget till the fiscal year that starts Oct. 1, 1992.
Stanley E. Collender, director of Federal budget policy at Price Waterhouse, and other experts said the budget agreement was unlikely to reduce the deficit as much as advertised for several reasons. The economic assumptions, while realistic for the years from 1991 through 1993, are overly optimistic for the next two years, they said.
 
'Optimistic Assumptions'
''Most of the savings for the last two years are the result of optimistic economic assumptions,'' Mr. Collender said. ''In fact, we don't have the slightest idea what will happen in 1994 and 1995.''
The deficit is sensitive to assumptions about the economy. If the economy grows less than projected, Federal tax receipts are normally less than projected. Likewise, if unemployment is higher than expected, the Government typically spends more for unemployment benefits, food stamps and other types of assistance. A recession would throw off many of the calculations in the budget summit agreement.
The fragility of economic assumptions is dramatically illustrated by changes in President Bush's estimate of the Federal budget deficit for the fiscal year 1991, which began Monday. On July 16, Mr. Bush told Congress that the 1991 deficit would total $231.4 billion under current law. But on Sunday he and Congressional leaders disclosed that they were now projecting a 1991 deficit of $293.7 billion if no changes were made in current law.
 
Darman Explains Big Jump
Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, listed three reasons for the $62.3 billion increase in his deficit projection, which startled many economists outside the Government. Deterioration of the economy, which causes a reduction in Federal revenue, increased his projection of the deficit by $30.4 billion. ''Technical changes,'' mainly unforeseen costs of the savings and loan debacle, increased the deficit by $31.2 billion, while minor changes in laws and regulations added $700 million.
Much of the cost of deploying American troops in the Middle East was omitted from the calculations in the budget summit agreement, also distorting the savings to be achieved. While negotiators said they had achieved $9.8 billion in savings in military programs for the current fiscal year, the military effort in the Middle East will cost $5.7 billion.
As a result, the ''total deficit reduction'' to be achieved this year is not $40.1 billion, as listed in the budget agreement, but $34.4 billion.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET AGREEMENT;
President's Address to Nation on Federal Deficit and the Budget Agreement

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Bush's speech last night from the Oval Office, as recorded by The New York Times.
Tonight I want to talk to you about a problem that has lingered and dogged and vexed this country for far too long - the Federal budget deficit.
Thomas Paine said many years ago, ''These are the times that try men's souls.'' As we speak, our nation is standing together against Saddam Hussein's aggression. But here at home, there's another threat - a cancer gnawing away at our nation's health. That cancer is the budget deficit. Year after year, it mortgages the future of our children. No family, no nation, can continue to do business the way the Federal Government has been operating and survive. 
When you get a bill, that bill must be paid. And when you write a check, you're supposed to have money in the bank. But if you don't obey these simple rules with common sense, there's a price to pay. But for too long, the nation's business in Washington has been conducted as if these basic rules did not apply.
Well, these rules do apply. And if we fail to act, next year alone we will face a Federal budget deficit of more than $300 billion, a deficit that could weaken our economy further and cost us thousands of precious jobs.
If what goes up must come down, then the way down could be very hard. But it doesn't have to be that way. We can do something. In fact, we have started to do something, but we must act this week, when Congress will hold the first of two crucial up-or-down votes. These votes will be on a deficit reduction agreement worked out between the Administration and the bipartisan leaders of Congress.
 
'Blood, Sweat and Fears'
This budget agreement is the result of eight months of blood, sweat and fears -fears of the economic chaos that would follow if we fail to reduce the deficit.
Of course, I cannot claim it's the best deficit reduction plan possible; it's not. Any one of us alone might have written a better plan. But it is the best agreement that can be legislated now.
It is the biggest deficit reduction agreement ever - half a trillion dollars. It's the toughest deficit reduction package ever, with new enforcement rules to make sure that what we fix now stays fixed. And it has the largest spending savings ever - more than $300 billion.
For the first time, a Republican President and leaders of the Democratic Congress have agreed to real cuts that will be enforced by law - not promises - no smoke, no mirrors, no magic act, but real and lasting spending cuts.
This agreement will also raise revenue. I'm not, and I know you're not, a fan of tax increases. But if there have to be tax measures, they should allow the economy to grow. They should not turn us back to higher income tax rates and they should be fair.
Everyone who can should contribute something and no one should have to contribute beyond their fair share. Our bipartisan agreement meets these tests and through specific new incentives it will help create more jobs.
It's a little-known fact that America's best job creators and greatest innovators tend to be our smaller companies, so our budget plan will give small- and medium-size companies a needed shot in the arm.
 
What the Accord Will Do
Just as important, I am convinced that this agreement will help lower interest rates, and lower interest rates mean savings for consumers, lower mortgage payments for new homeowners and more investment to produce more jobs. And that's what this agreement will do.
And now let me tell you what this agreement will not do. It will not raise income tax rates, personal or corporate. It will not mess with Social Security in any way. It will not put America's national security at risk, and, most of all, it will not let our economy slip out of control.
Clearly, each and every one of us can find fault with something in this agreement. In fact, that is a burden that any truly fair solution must carry. Any workable solution must be judged as a whole, not piece by piece.
Those who dislike one part or another may pick our agreement apart, but if they do, believe me, the political reality is no one can put a better one back together again. Everyone will bear a small burden. But if we succeed, every American will have a large burden lifted.
If we fail to enact this agreement, our economy will falter, markets may tumble and recession will follow. In just a moment, the Democratic majority leader, Senator Mitchell, will offer what is known as the Democratic response - often a rebuttal - but not tonight. Tonight, the Democratic and Republican leadership and I all speak with one voice in support of this agreement. Tonight, we ask you to help us move this agreement forward.
The Congressional leadership and I both have a job to do in getting it enacted and, tonight, I ask for your help. First, I ask you to understand how important and, for some, how difficult this vote is for your Congressmen and Senators.
 
'Take This Initiative'
Many worry about your reaction to one part or another. But I know you know the importance of the whole. And so, second, I ask you to take this initiative. Tell your Congressmen and Senators you support this deficit reduction agreement.
If they are Republicans, urge them to stand with the President. Urge them to do what the bipartisan leadership has done - come together in the spirit of compromise to solve this national problem.
If they're Democrats, urge them to stand with their Congressional leaders. Ask them to fight for the future of your kids by supporting this budget agreement.
Now is the time for you, the American people, to have a real impact. Your Senators and Congressmen need to know that you want this deficit brought down - that the time for posturing and politics is over and the time to come together is now.
This deficit reduction agreement is tough, and so are the times. The agreement is fair, and so is the American spirit. The agreement is bipartisan, and so is the vote. The agreement is real, and so is this crisis.
This is the first time in my Presidency that I've made an appeal like this to you, the American people. With your help we can, at last, put this budget crisis behind us and face the other challenges that lie ahead.
If we do, the long-term result will be a healthier nation, and something more: We will have once again put ourselves on the path of economic growth, and we will have demonstrated that no challenge is greater than the determination of the American people.
God bless you, and good night.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET AGREEMENT;
Democratic Leader's Response To President's Budget Address

 BODY:
The following is a transcript of a statement by Senator George J. Mitchell, the Democratic majority leader, in response to President Bush's address, as recorded by The New York Times:
I speak tonight not for the Democratic Party, but for America's future. For more than a decade, the United States has endured budget deficits that sap our economic strength. When you have a deficit there are only two things you can do: cut spending or increase revenue. This agreement does both. It cuts spending, military and domestic; it raises taxes. 
The President has asked you to support the budget agreement. The Democratic leadership in Congress joins in that appeal.
We recognize that this budget demands sacrifice from all Americans. But if enacted, it holds the promise of restoring a sound economy from which all Americans will benefit. The agreement is a compromise. It's not what the President, working alone, would have preferred. It's not what we Democrats, working on our own, would have produced. Neither side got all it wanted. And many are asking why did it take so long. The answer is simple: what delayed us for months is what has divided us for years.
Democrats and Republicans have deep differences over values and priorities. We'd prefer a budget that asks more from the wealthy and less from the elderly. But when the President asked us to join in rewriting his budget, we agreed because the nation is more important than partisan differences.
When the President asked us to help work out a compromise, he got our help. Now we hope that members of his party, the Republican members of Congress, will also set aside partisan differences as we have done, and join us in doing what's right for our country.
Two centuries ago, the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia was drawing to a close. The delegates had quarreled for months. Now they were to vote on a difficult compromise. Benjamin Franklin, 81 years old, rose slowly and said to his fellow delegates: ''I confess that are several parts of this Constitution which I do not approve, but I doubt whether any other convention may be able to make a better Constitution. For when you assemble men to have the advantage of their joint wisdom, you inevitably assemble all their prejudices, their passions, their errors of opinion, their local interests, their selfish views. From such an assembly can a perfect production be expected? I consent to this Constitution because I expect no better and because I am not sure it is not the best.''
Of course, no budget can be compared with the Constitution, but Franklin's point applies. Every human work is imperfect, and that's certainly true of this budget. But it's also true that for America's economic future, we have to pass it. With your help, we will.
Thank you and good night.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET AGREEMENT;
Big Companies May Benefit From Breaks for Small Ones

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
Under the proposed budget accord, many large businesses that went private in leveraged buyouts in the 1980's could benefit from some of the tax breaks tentatively being set aside for qualified small businesses, several Wall Street experts said yesterday.
Though the realization is making its way only slowly through the financial community, the proposed tax breaks, if adopted, could well be the first piece of good news that the leveraged-buyout crowd has had in a long time.
''I've got somebody thinking about it,'' said Richard Beattie, a partner at the New York law firm of Simpson, Thacher & Bartlett and a leading adviser to Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company.
 
Position Is Confirmed
Mr. Beattie's opinion, confirmed yesterday by people on Capitol Hill who were involved in the budget talks, is that the proposal in no way disqualifies big businesses that happen to have little equity because they were taken private in leveraged buyouts. 
Yet the sense yesterday on Wall Street was that the politicians would probably shudder to know that they were inadvertently helping some large, but overleveraged, businesses ranging from R. H. Macy & Company, the New York retailer, to Owens Illinois Inc., the glass-container maker in Toledo, Ohio, as well as the advisers who plunged those companies into debt.
''It was an unintended consequence,'' said Frank A. Weil, a former Commerce Department official in the Carter White House who now runs a boutique specializing in leveraged buyouts.
Many leveraged buyout companies would qualify for the tax breaks intended for small businesses because they have so little shareholders' equity; instead, they are often financed with huge levels of bank loans. But the small-business investment incentives in the budget deal apply to companies with shareholders' equity - or book value - of less than $50 million.
 
Billions in Savings
Because the leveraged buyouts have so much debt and comparatively little equity, many would qualify for the ''small business'' tax breaks, even though some of them may have billions of dollars in sales a year.
The main tax break for qualified companies would allow anyone who buys securities issued by the businesses starting next year to deduct 25 percent of the purchase price up to $50,000 off that year's tax return, thus subsidizing investment in the companies.
Macy's may be one of the more stunning examples. The retailer reported $7 billion of sales in its last fiscal year, and yet had a negative shareholders' equity of $326 million because of sizable interest costs, thus appearing to qualify it for the tax breaks.
People on Capitol Hill who were involved in the last-minute budget accord confirmed yesterday that it was never their intent to help the refinance the remaining leveraged buyouts from the 1980's, and they said they anticipated that the language would be narrowed by the time Congress voted on a final package. The language would probably close the loophole for the big borrowers of the 1980's, they said.
''I believe that members of the budget summit saw this as a targeted provision for small businesses, those companies that were providing most of the country's job opportunities, and are going to seek to draft the proposal in a way to meet that intent,'' said Michael Wessel, the policy director for Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Democrat from Missouri who is House majority leader.
In a leveraged buyout, a financing technique that was in its heyday in the 1980's, investor groups bought companies by borrowing almost the entire purchase price. By putting so little of their own money to work, the buyers risked little, yet stood to make huge returns on their equity investments once the debt was repaid - assuming the businesses could be resold.
Though the strategy made instant millionaires of many buyers, it lost favor in the trying economy of the late 1980's. In particular, the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., and the high-yield debt market it had developed, as well as softness in the market for initial public offerings, left many owners with no way to cash out their investments.
But some nimble deal makers and their advisers are now looking into the possibility that the package of tax incentives designed to stimulate small-business activity could also be applied to many leveraged buyouts.
The rewards for qualifying would be well worth it. Businesses that meet the tests would be eligible for a variety of handsome tax breaks, from higher-than-usual tax deductions for research and development spending to a discount on the gain that investors use to calculate their tax owed when they sell their shares.
Many experts did not think the Government would stand for these provisions being applied to heavily indebted large companies. said Abbie J. Smith, a University of Chicago professor who has studied leveraged buyouts, said, ''The climate for the last few years seems unfriendly towards debt and mergers and takeovers and whatnot, so to the extent they foresee that big highly leveraged companies would fall under this $50 million threshhold, I would not be surprised if they would somehow put a ceiling on the debt-to-equity ratio.''

HEADLINE: Real Estate;
Pennzoil's Big Ventures In Houston

BYLINE: By Lettice Stuart

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
THE Pennzoil Company, a Houston-based natural resource concern and the largest seller of motor oil in the United States, has been bottom fishing in this city's troubled real estate market and is acquiring a large portfolio of properties.
During the last two years, Pennzoil has been involved in the acquisition of four office buildings with a total of 1.2 million square feet of space, and four apartment complexes with a total of 1,734 units, representing an investment of $140 million.
In July, Pennzoil and its joint-venture partners, J. P. Morgan Investments of New York and the Veriquest Companies of Houston, completed one of the largest office building transactions in Houston this year. The partnership bought the 20-story Three Riverway building for $36 million from the insolvent San Jacinto Savings Association. 
All eight properties owned by the partnership were purchased at about 65 percent of replacement cost, said a Veriquest director, Larry A. Strickland. Pennzoil and Morgan Investments each has contributed 50 percent of the equity capital. Veriquest, a Houston-based real estate service firm, finds properties for the partnership to buy and handles leasing and management.
Real estate investment is a new venture for Pennzoil, said James L. Pate, the company's president and chief executive. Pennzoil's principal business is exploring for and producing oil, natural gas and sulfur and manufacturing and marketing refined petroleum products.
''We believe Houston real estate -the right kind, at least - provides an excellent opportunity to make money,'' said Mr. Pate, who joined Pennzoil in 1976 as chief economist and later served as treasurer and chief financial officer before becoming president earlier this year.
None of the $3 billion Pennzoil received from Texaco in settlement of a lawsuit in 1988 has been used to buy real estate, Mr. Strickland said.
Late in 1987, after determining that Houston's economy had bottomed out and was in the early stages of recovery, Pennzoil formed its partnership with Morgan and Veriquest ''to go bottom fishing for income-producing property,'' Mr. Pate said. They concentrated on properties that could be bought at a fraction of their replacement cost, could produce income and were situated near Houston's central area. ''We figure if a property meets those criteria, we'll be able to hold it four, five or six years before turning it over at a gain,'' Mr. Pate said.
The partners began their real estate investments in January 1988 with the purchase of two apartment complexes on the city's West Side. The 235-unit Green Meadows Apartments was bought from First City Bank and the 250-unit Copper Mill Apartments from Texas Commerce Bank for undisclosed sums. Occupancy rates at the two complexes have since increased and monthly rents have risen.
The investors later paid $43 million for the Savannah Club Apartments and the Westcreek Apartments with a total of 1,259 units, but soon after that they decided there were too many others seeking bargains in the apartment market. Mr. Pate said the investors felt that the opportunities in acquiring apartments in Houston had passed and decided to focus on office buildings, particularly in the Galleria area. The Galleria is a 1.5 million-square-foot retail-office-hotel complex developed in 1970.
Pennzoil and its partners bought two office buildings adjacent to the Galleria for an undisclosed amount.

HEADLINE: Affirmative Action - How to Make It Work?;
A Company Recasts Itself To Erase Bias on the Job

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CORNING, N.Y.

 BODY:
When a black job candidate comes here to Corning Inc. for interviews, managers have a real incentive to hire him. Raises and bonuses for the executives, most of whom are white men, depend largely on recruiting blacks and women and on their success in training and promoting them.
Not only that. One interviewer is a black from the department where the recruit would start work. The interviewer helps put the candidate at ease, and afterward joins in assessing the candidate to guard against intrusions of racism. Once hired, most black recruits and many women are assigned a ''coach,'' someone from another department who shows them the ways of Corning and steers them around the pitfalls that can thwart promotions.
 
Ambitious Experiment
Corning, the giant family-controlled maker of Pyrex, Corning Ware and Steuben crystal, is engaged in one of corporate America's most ambitious experiments in cultural engineering. The company accommodates women and blacks in a score of ways, all ultimately intended to assure them of a good crack at the top jobs in the company. Eventually, the company wants to do the same for other minority members, who are fewer around Corning. 
Pressed by advocacy groups and Government, and above all by their own economic self-interest, many big companies nowadays are trying to make affirmative action work better than it did five and 10 years ago. Corning, like many others, managed to hire women and blacks quite easily then, but many promptly fled, blaming entrenched, if often subtle, discrimination.
A few prominent companies have learned to retain women, and fewer still have done well by blacks. The advocates for women and blacks call Corning a rarer case of a company that has adopted effective ways to help both groups, even to the extent of luring black barbers and hairdressers to the area around Corning, where white barbers would not learn to cut blacks' hair.
''The corporation has been very receptive to just about everything that women and blacks have said they need to be able to do their work better,'' said Gail Baity, a black woman who started in industrial relations at Corning 14 years ago. She now conducts an intensive two-day course to purge employees of racist attitudes. This course and one on sexism are required for thousands of managers and professional employees.
Sybil Mobley, dean of the predominantly black business school at Florida A&M University in Tallahassee, said: ''Our experience with them is very good, across the board. Our students have found that it's a very good place to work.'' Catalyst, a women's advocacy group in New York, has granted only four companies special awards for commitment to women: Gannett, Du Pont, Avon Products and Corning.
 
Curiosity and a Backlash
The director of Corning's cultural diversity program, Dawn M. Cross, said, ''During the course of a week, we get 20 to 25 calls from companies that are just beginning to deal with these issues.''
But Corning's anti-discrimination efforts have fostered something of a backlash among the 3,000 white, male managers, professionals and technicians. Their generation is being asked to pay for all the earlier generations' discrimination in keeping the big, best-paid jobs for themselves.
White men still far outnumber other groups at Corning, and they still get most promotions. But more are bypassed than ever, too, and there is little the company intends to do about it. ''A backlash is one of the prices you pay,'' said J. Edwin O'Brien Jr., director of education, training and recruiting. ''Not that we like it or want it. It's a price of progress.''
Some white men assert that management has set lower job standards for women and blacks, but Mr. O'Brien flatly denies it.
''It wouldn't work,'' he said. ''Women and blacks would be the first to complain. And the people would fail. They wouldn't get salary increases. They wouldn't get promotions. And they'll look at their counterparts and quit.''
 
Gains for Workers
Once Scorned, Now a Mentor
A beneficiary of Corning's affirmative action policies is LeRoy E. Hambrick, a black who is consumer products marketing manager for Asia. Corning hired him 17 years ago, when he was 22, and dispatched him to a factory here as a foreman.
''One guy wrote a slur on a machine, 'Nigger, go home,' '' he recalled, and he said he ignored it. He said he never encountered such blatant bigotry any more and rarely its subtler forms. ''I play tennis with vice presidents,'' he said. ''Some white males even gravitate toward me as a mentor.''
Another is Lina M. Echeverria. She and her husband, both Ph.D. scientists from Stanford, joined the company's research laboratories in the early 1980's. A couple of years ago, as part of a team exploring new ceramic materials, Ms. Echeverria said, she proposed a novel research procedure derived from her doctoral work in geology. None of the others on the team, white men, had studied geology, and in their ignorance, she said, they belittled her.
 
The Numbers Change
''My ability to do something was questioned,'' Ms. Echeverria said. ''I raised my voice and said, 'I'm not going to take this any more.' It was a difficult point in my career.'' To hold on to Ms. Echeverria, management transferred her to what she said was a far better assignment in materials research.
For its efforts, the company has begun to show some real gains. It says 52 percent of the salaried employees it has hired over the past three years are women, and 16 percent are black. Three years ago, the roughly 150 top managers included four white women and one black man. Today the same group has seven women and five blacks, including a black woman who is double counted.
Of 5,365 salaried personnel, the source of the top managers of 20 or 30 years from now, the percentage of women has climbed to 33.6 percent from 17.4 percent. Among blacks the gain has been much smaller, to 5.5 percent from 5.1 percent. But that is well above the levels of most companies, and the percentage of blacks who quit the company has dropped to 10.9 percent last year from 15.1 percent in 1987.
 
Motives for Companies
Self-Interest Amid Change
All big companies, Corning included, still have a long way to go in bringing women and minority members to the highest level of management. At the pinnacle of American corporations, women and minority members fill less than one percent of the jobs, and at Corning they hold none.
All the secretaries in the headquarters' glistening ninth-floor executive chambers are women. All the executives - the chairman, James R. Houghton, and six others - are white men. The culture there is starkly male, too. All but one of the seven smoke cigars.
Yet the ''Seven Ups,'' as their underlings know them, say they are committed to seeing that the next generations of Seven Ups will be a richer mix. ''It's the right thing to do,'' Mr. Houghton said. But more to the point, he said, it is a critical business thing to do.
To prosper and grow in the next decades, Corning says it needs competent managers, scientists and engineers, and irreversible demographic trends oblige the company to turn to women and blacks.
 
Fewer White Male Workers
The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that by the end of the 1990's, 39 percent of all workers will be white men, a decline from almost half 15 years ago, and that white males will account for just 20 percent of all the people entering the labor force by the end of the decade.
For companies like Corning, heavily oriented to technological advances, the competition for workers will be especially stiff because of a paucity of blacks who have the doctoral degrees that the company needs for its labs. Blacks account for 12 percent of the population but only 2 percent of the nation's scientists and engineers. A little over 4 percent at Corning are black.
''What happened to me was that about 1986, I got concerned,'' Mr. Houghton said. ''We had been doing our equal opportunity, affirmative action bit for a long time, and we'd gone up every year as a percent in hiring.'' Yet Mr. Houghton found that around 15 percent of the company's women and blacks were quitting the company's salaried ranks each year, about triple the rate of white men.
 
Blocked From the Top
Management wondered if women and blacks left because competitors were poaching on Corning's recruits, or if the town was just too dull. Corning, an old-fashioned company town, is tucked amid the pastures of western New York State, an hour's drive from the closest real city, the minor metropolis of Ithaca.
But in their departure interviews, women and blacks said their biggest gripe was evidence that their progress up the ranks was restricted. ''We found the reason was not the town but the perceived opportunities,'' Mr. Houghton said.
''I put a few things together,'' Mr. Houghton said, ''and said this has to be a major corporate initiative.''
Civil rights laws and the Bush Administration's new promises to use its power of Federal contracting to open up the executive suite have little relevance to this. Nor has the White House's opposition to the civil rights bill in Congress on the ground that it might force employers to set hiring quotas for women and blacks.
Mr. Houghton says he doesn't like numerical goals either. ''But I don't know of any way around them.''
 
Game Plan for Corning
Encouraging Ethnic Pride
Mr. Houghton has set two goals for Corning: one, the better mix of women and blacks in the company's management and professional ranks, and two, making a virtue of the mix. He says he wants a salad, not a puree - blacks who are proud to be black and women who are proud to be mothers and engineers. The melting pot is a delusion, black executives here say, and Corning's emphasis on it a decade ago led to the exclusion of both blacks and women and to their flight from the company.
Early in the company's affirmative action efforts, Ms. Baity said, blacks and women were encouraged to adopt not only the company's basic values -like integrity, hard work and a commitment to profits and growth - but also its white male cultural values, including dress and social activities. Women tried to look like men, donning gray flannel suits and neckties.
In meetings, people were expected to repress views they were passionate about and save disputes for private offices. Even now, Ms. Echeverria said, ''you don't display aggressive behavior, even if you have to push a project very fast.''
 
To Accept, Not Assimilate
But such gentlemanliness can thwart the progress of women, she said, because in meetings, white male managers sometimes ignore women unless they demand attention. Inevitably, too, women and blacks who tried to be like white men couldn't, and they were denied opportunities and fled.
''The goal was assimilation so that we would come out with a homogenized mix,'' Ms. Cross said. ''Today people are encouraged to maintain their cultural identity and ethnic heritage, and managers are encouraged to value that richness and to see that it adds value to the corporation.''
Ms. Baity said: ''We want people to recognize race. I want people to look at me as a black female who is competent in her job.''
Some things the company has done might not seem like much to a white man who can find basic amenities even in a town of 12,000 like Corning. But Corning's blacks could not find programs they liked on radio or television, just as they could not find barbers.
 
Recruiting Them Early
So the company prevailed on the cable television outlet to pipe in a black radio station from Rochester and the Black Entertainment Network from Washington. The company has also helped recruit black teachers for the public schools and an assistant principal who is black.
To recruit women and blacks to Corning, the company offers well-paid internships to undergraduates more readily than it offers them to white male students. Blacks and women, much more than white men, tend to drop out of advanced science and engineering courses, and Kurt R. Fischer, human resources manager for the company's research and development operations, says the internships help keep them on course.
The 17 colleges that Corning calls its key recruiting campuses are mostly science and engineering schools, but they include just as many predominantly black schools - Howard, Florida A&M, and North Carolina A&T -as Ivy League schools - Cornell, the University of Pennsylvania and Mr. Houghton's alma mater, Harvard.
More than most companies, Corning also goes to great lengths to find jobs at Corning for recruits' spouses or ''significant others,'' as one official puts it. Several hundred couples work for the company, all subject to only one firm rule: that one spouse not work for the other.
In hundreds of other cases, Corning has helped recruits' spouses get jobs around town, including many in businesses that deal primarily with Corning.
 
Adjustments for Everyone
Resentment, And Praise
Blacks and women say the company could do still more. Corning operates a day care center for children 3 to 5 years old, for example, but young parents say they have just as much need for one for infants and toddlers. Some also want paid paternity leave. The company permits unpaid leave for fathers, and so far only one has taken it.
Blacks say Corning could do more in the community, using its influence to draw a few black merchants and still more black teachers.
The economics of Corning's accommodations are hard to gauge. The classes, the day care center, the personnel who manage the affirmative action efforts all cost something, but far less than the $4 million a year that Mr. Houghton says the company was spending a few years ago to recruit and train women and blacks to replace those who were quitting. And of course, people who do not anguish over racial and sexual abuse tend to work harder and more happily, helping Corning make money.
 
Quotas a 'Fact of Life'
Many white men say they accept the change, but many also say they know of others who are resentful and bristling. One who says he accepts the new competition for the top jobs is James N. Nagel, 33, whose wife, like him, is a middle-level manufacturing executive. ''The competition for me will be more difficult,'' Mr. Nagel said. ''Corning has quotas. I don't resent it. It's a fact of life.''
With the change in Corning's personnel mix, a change in the company's gentlemanly ways seems well under way. White men must now contend with women like Wendy E. Luce, 35, who as operations manager of a factory here is the highest-ranking woman in the overwhelmingly male manufacturing side of the company. Ms. Luce says she has no compunctions about yelling when she sees fit. ''I'd rather see people get excited,'' she said.
Roy A. Farr, 60, her deputy at the plant, called her a good boss, but different. ''Wendy really feels for people,'' he said. ''She is kinder than men, more considerate, but not to the point where it gets in the way of the business. She knows what she wants to do. She leads. Men demand.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET AGREEMENT;
GREENSPAN CALLS BUDGET PROPOSAL A 'CREDIBLE' PLAN

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
With a critical test vote on the budget compromise scheduled for Thursday and Congress in rebellion, President Bush and the Congressional leadership got a boost today when Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, endorsed the budget plan for the first time and implied that it would drive down interest rates.
But White House officials said late in the afternoon that they still did not have the votes they needed, and the President spent the day in the most strenuous lobbying campaign of his term. He was joined by leaders of both parties, who scrambled in the Capitol all day to muster a bipartisan majority behind the most politically unpopular budget measure in years - one that would raise taxes or reduce benefits for almost all Americans.
Officials counting prospective votes said everything turned on whether the President's personal appeals were powerful enough to swing sufficient support in the House of Representatives. Party leaders said that if the House approved the budget deal, the Senate would surely follow. 
 
'Enforceable Reduction'
Mr. Greenspan, who has more influence over interest rates than anyone else in Government, said in testimony on banking legislation before a House subcommittee that the budget negotiators had ''crafted what appears to be a credible, enforceable reduction in the budget deficit stretching over a number of years.''
For months, Mr. Greenspan has said interest rates would fall if the financial markets found a budget settlement ''credible.''
The package, he said today, would ''reduce the drain of the Federal deficit on our national savings, lessen pressures in credit markets and enhance investment and the long-run growth potential of the United States.''
Despite his comments, prices of Treasury securities were mixed today and bond traders focused on what they considered disturbing reports about the budget package's reception in Congress. Long-term interest rates rose slightly, and short-term rates were little changed.
Mr. Bush, who canceled a campaign swing through New England that was to begin Thursday, met with 20 wavering Republican legislators and called many more today, the White House said.
Mr. Bush said he was urging lawmakers to ''blame the President'' if they had trouble withstanding the political heat that would be generated by a vote for the package.
 
Vote Count Is Short
By this evening, vote-counters in both parties in the House said the budget package was far short of enough commitments to win approval. A test vote for the package is scheduled for Thursday afternoon, but some officials said it might be delayed if the President and the Congressional leaders believed they might lose.
After his television address on Tuesday night and a news conference this morning for out-of-town newspaper editors, Mr. Bush said, ''It is our last best chance to try to get this Federal deficit under control.'' Without the budget deal, the President added, ''We are courting disaster.''
The legislators and officials who solicit votes and tally commitments in advance usually poor-mouth how they are faring. They want each legislator to think his or her vote is critical. So it was difficult to ascertain how Mr. Bush and his Congressional allies were doing today.
''We're not there yet, but we've got another 24 hours,'' said Richard G. Darman, the President's budget director. ''We are spending every minute right now concentrating on getting additional votes.''
Before today, House Republicans seemed to hold the key to approval of the package negotiated by White House officials and Congressional leaders over four arduous weeks last month.
 
Opposition Builds
A conservative faction led by Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the Republican whip, is fighting the plan on the ground that the higher taxes would be damaging to the economy.
But substantial opposition was expressed this morning at a caucus of House Democrats, and at the day's end, only about a third were publicly committed to voting for the package. For a time, there was some discussion among the Democratic leadership of postponing the vote.
Representative William H. Gray 3d of Pennsylvania, the Democratic whip, said the stumbling block was still Republicans.
Mr. Gray, who is in charge of assembling Democratic votes, said tonight that his troops would stand pat and watch the vote progress. If a majority of Republicans supported the President, he said, a majority of Democrats would also do so.
Mr. Darman seemed to anticipate that tactic and not to mind. The White House, he said, could neither ask nor expect the Democrats to take the political risk of voting for such an unpopular plan if most Republicans did not do so.
 
Foley Sees Majorities
The Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, said his ''intuition'' was that ''when the vote comes, there will be a majority of both parties.''
Pressed to predict the outcome, Mr. Darman told reporters, ''We're not going to have any votes to spare.''
It is not unusual in the House for controversial measures to be voted down the first time only to be approved later, and that could be the case this time. In the end, Mr. Darman said, ''I do not believe it will fail.''
The first vote in the House will be on a procedural measure, called a rule, that sets the grounds for debate. If that passes, the Representatives will then vote on a budget resolution that comprises the broad outline of the agreement made by the President and Congress.
Votes on the specific legislation actually dealing with such unpopular matters as a 12-cent increase in the gasoline tax and deep cuts in Medicare benefits are not scheduled until week after next.
 
A Strong No Vote
At the Democrats' caucus this morning, Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, the influential chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, spoke strongly against the negotiated plan, legislators said.
Mr. Rostenkowski has been upset, in part, because he was basically left out of the writing of major tax legislation and because the package contains a provision that would require some Government workers in his district to pay Social Security taxes for the first time. He has fought that provision for years.
But Mr. Rostenkowski also opposes the measure's tax breaks for business and the cuts in the Medicare program, which is under his committee's jurisdiction.
Some Democrats thought Mr. Rostenkowski's opposition was enough to cause the compromise to fail. Others thought it might help the budget clear the test votes if lawmakers thought they could count on the chairman to fix the substantive problems in his committee before they have to be voted on week after next.
Under the terms of the agreement, the President and Congressional leaders pledged to fight any important changes in the compromise. But the changes could be reversed in a Senate-House conference, some lawmakers suggested, if they were needed to get the budget through the House.
 
An Alternative
David R. Obey, a senior Democrat from Wisconsin, today suggested an alternative budget that would raise taxes for the wealthy, limit the cuts in Medicare and reduce military spending substantially more than the compromise package.
The Congressional Joint Tax Committee has issued estimates showing that under the plan, taxes would rise most for poor people and least for the wealthy. Mr. Darman challenged those figures.
Mr. Obey is widely respected among Democrats and is usually loyal to the leadership. His stance seemed to influence some fellow liberals.
''A lot of Democrats you would expect to follow the leaders are still undecided, and I think that's not good,'' said Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat who plans to support the leadership on at least the first round of votes.
Republican supporters of President Bush said his television speech helped provide political cover with unhappy constituents.
The President asked Americans to contact their Representatives on behalf of the budget plan. Lawmakers said that the President's appeal had generated some calls today but that the calls and mail, much of it generated by organized lobbies, were still running heavily against the plan.

HEADLINE: LOCAL RACES HELP BRAZILIAN LEADER

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RIO DE JANEIRO, Oct. 3

 BODY:
In a vote expected to strengthen Brazil's new President, Brazilians elected a new Congress today with a predominantly center-right cast, early returns and polls of voters indicated.
While the left collapsed around the nation, conservatives and centrists prevailed in races for the nation's 27 state governorships.
The vote was the first since last December when Fernando Collor de Mello, a free-market conservative, narrowly defeated Luis Inacio da Silva, a Socialist, in presidential elections. Although today's vote was not billed as a referendum on Mr. Collor's radical economic program, the local elections are expected to strengthen the President's hand in opening Latin America's largest economy to free trade, more foreign investment and a reduced economic role for the state. 
Of key importance to voters, Mr. Collor pushed Brazil's monthly inflation rate down to 13 percent in September, from 80 percent last March, when he was inaugurated for a five-year term.
 
'Loose Majority' Predicted
Final results in the congressional races are not expected for two weeks, but early returns indicated that Brazil's 84 million voters favored candidates from the President's center-right coalition. In 1993, Congress will also be empowered to amend Brazil's Constitution.
''Congress will probably be slightly more conservative, giving Collor a loose majority,'' David Fleischer, a political science professor in Brasilia, predicted in a telephone interview today.
Mr. Collor sought to distance himself from the vote, returning today to vote in his home state of Alagoas after a 11-day trip to the United States, Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia.
He is expected to participate more actively in a second phase - runoff races in states where no gubernatorial candidate won more than 50 percent of the valid vote. In the campaign for the runoffs on Nov. 25, one candidate certain to win presidential backing is Paulo Maluf. Mr. Maluf, who served as best man at Mr. Collor's second marriage several years ago, is the front-runner in the race for Governor of Sao Paulo, Brazil's richest and most populous state.
In contrast to last year's national race when voters chose newcomers, like the 41-year-old Mr. Collor, voters today preferred veteran, mainstream politicians with strong regional bases. Loosely allied or sympathetic to Mr. Collor, these candidates for governor include Gilberto Mestrinho of Amazonas State, Antonio Carlos Magalhaes of Bahia State, Joaquim Roriz of the Federal District of Brasilia, and Helio Garcia of Minas Gerais State. Jose Sarney, Mr. Collor's predecessor, will return to Brasilia as a Senator from the Amazonian state of Amapa .
 
'Not a Puppet Congress'
''Collor exhausted the need for change,'' Alexandre de Barros, a Brasilia political analyst said, referring to the new President's freezing of bank assets and frontal attack on big government. ''That's why people went so much for old, establishment politicians, It's going to be a critical Congress, not a puppet Congress. But life is going to be easier for Collor.''
Bucking the national trend, Leonel Brizola, a 68-year-old left-wing populist, apparently swept to victory in the race for Governor of Rio de Janeiro State. With an eye to the 1994 presidential elections, Mr. Brizola is expected to assume the leadership of Brazil's left-wing opposition.
Mr. da Silva's Workers' Party, a major force in last year's presidential election, is not expected to win any governorships and is braced for a reduction in its 17-member congressional delegation.
The only place where a Workers' Party candidate for governor has a fighting chance is the western Amazon state of Acre. On Oct. 25, in the thick of the runoff campaign, Acre is to be the site of the trial of two ranchers charged in the murder in December 1988 of Francisco (Chico) Mendes, an Amazon trade unionist who was closely allied with the Workers' Party.
Another loser in the voting today was the center-left Brazilian Democratic Movement Party, the nation's oldest political party. The Democratic Movement's hold on state governorships is expected to fall to 6, from 22.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Gorbachev Sends a Chief Adviser To Iraq in New Diplomatic Effort

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 3

 BODY:
President Mikhail S. Gorbachev opened a new diplomatic front in the gulf crisis today, dispatching one of his chief Middle East advisers to the region in the effort to persuade Iraq to restore Kuwait's independence.
Yevgeny M. Primakov, a member of Mr. Gorbachev's Presidential Council and a Middle East scholar who served in the region as a journalist, departed for an overnight stop in Jordan, where he met with King Hussein in Amman before moving on to Baghdad.
The choice of Mr. Primakov for the mission underscored Mr. Gorbachev's fresh attempt at negotiating a settlement of the tense two-month crisis, now bristling with hundreds of thousands of troops commanded by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and the array of nations opposed to his seizure of Kuwait. 
President Gorbachev has declined to contribute military forces but has joined global economic sanctions against Iraq. The Soviet leader, while firmly denouncing Iraq for aggression, has been trying to retain the Kremlin's influence as a one-time close ally of Baghdad.
 
Gulf Crisis as a 'Laboratory'
In a newspaper interview before departing, Mr. Primakov said the recent summit meeting in Helsinki between Mr. Gorbachev and President Bush had increased the momentum for negotiated settlements of world problems.
''However dangerous the gulf crisis may be in itself and however important it is to settle it, I think we should proceed from the fact that it offers a kind of laboratory, testing our efforts to create a new world order after the Cold War,'' he told Literaturnaya Gazeta, a major Soviet news and cultural weekly.
Soviet diplomacy in the crisis has involved both closer ties between Presidents Gorbachev and Bush and a separate attempt to revive the traditional Soviet initiative, long opposed in Washington, for multi-national Middle East negotiations with a broader agenda that would include the Israeli-Palestinian issue as well.
Mr. Primakov's itinerary is to include a meeting in Amman with Yasir Arafat, the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, according to Foreign Ministry officials quoted by Tass, the Soviet press agency.
 
Evacuation of Nationals Sought
The issue of evacuating the more than 5,000 Soviet military personnel, technicians and their dependents from Iraq will also be pressed by Mr. Primakov, a 61-year-old Gorbachev confidant, economist and former director of the Soviet Institute of Oriental Studies.
''Some problems and difficulties'' have arisen with Baghdad officials over the evacuation, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze of the Soviet Union said in New York today before a meeting with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d.
Mr. Shevardnadze said Mr. Primakov, in seeking to talk with President Hussein, would be trying ''to arrange normal conditions for the withdrawal of Soviet citizens from that country.''
President Hussein has made hostages of the nationals of governments that have denounced his move into Kuwait, although Soviet nationals have thus far been spared, even as the Gorbachev Government has heightened its criticism. Most recently Mr. Shevardnadze, stressing the Soviet reliance on the United Nations in the crisis, declared that the U.N. was entitled to ''suppress aggression'' if Iraq continued its aggressive footing in the gulf crisis.
 
Message to King Hussein
Mr. Primakov carried a message from President Gorbachev to King Hussein and the King expressed ''profound satisfaction,'' according to the Tass dispatch from Amman. ''The two men expressed anxiety over the anger of armed clashes in the gulf and stressed the need for a political settlement of the situation,'' Tass said.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
Unity in Pensive Key

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BERLIN, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Germans, whether they had lived in East Germany or West Germany, woke up this morning in Germany, a country nobody had known since the end of World War II.
In a way, after the fall of the Berlin wall and the rest of the Iron Curtain last year, the events seemed anticlimactic, though they set the formal seal on the end of the cold war and brought an end to the division of Europe that began with Yalta and Potsdam.
But the division really began with Hitler and the war he launched in 1939, as President Richard von Weizsacker reminded Germans in a speech today on the day of unity, a glorious day of warm summer-like sunshine and golden autumn leaves. His was one of many appeals to Germans today to be ''nachdenklich,'' a word meaning reflective, meditative and subdued that seemed to capture the national mood. 
Germany's Western allies had reason to feel the same way today, as unification marked the formal end of the long cold war. By the logic of that struggle, West Germany had devoted itself to democratic political and military integration with the West. 'Wasting Asset' for U.S. But in the logic of peace, when the remaining 360,000 Soviet troops pull out of what was East Germany in four years, what will insure that Germans will still want American troops here, even in reduced numbers? President Francois Mitterrand has already announced that the 50,000 French troops in Germany will leave before Germans get tired of having them here.
A Western diplomat here wondered if or how the United States would move to preserve its security interests in Germany if, as expected, the Soviet Union continued to disintegrate.
''The major American asset - a security guarantee for Europe - is a wasting asset,'' the diplomat said. ''I'm not sure the United States wishes to or can sustain a long-term interest in Central or Eastern Europe. Germany is the only country that can.''
Now that Germany has achieved unification, it is unclear whether it will eventually turn its gaze from West and resume - or is forced by default to assume - its former position as the dominant power of Central Europe.
But even if it does, a united Germany today has a chance to be a profoundly different country than it ever was before, as Mr. von Weizsacker pointed out. For the first time in German history, he said, unity had not come at the expense of Germany's neighbors, but was the freely accepted result of peaceful international agreement and a peaceful German revolution in the streets.
 
Reflective, Brooding Mood
In Leipzig, where that revolution was born only 12 months ago, the mood was not only reflective but even brooding on the eve of unification, despite the German flags that hung from a few buildings.
The atmosphere in Bach's St. Thomas Church there, on the eve of unification, spoke eloquently. Inside, visitors from all over Europe had posted a whole bulletin board with prayers that things would turn out better this time than they had the last time Germany was united.
One, from a German man from Dusseldorf, said: ''God give the German people an understanding of their past mistakes. It must not happen again.''
On the organ, a Bach chorale-prelude on the hymn ''Now Thank We All Our God'' echoed through the sober Gothic nave, the cantus firmus melody seeming to speak through the plaintive minor-key accompaniment of struggle and doubt, rather than thanksgiving.
The nearby St. Nicholas Church, from which the Monday demonstrations for democracy and human rights of a year ago started out, was closed today, its bells silent.
''There are some people for whom we could hold a service of thanksgiving,'' said the pastor, the Rev. Christian Fuhrer, ''to celebrate the fact that the borders are open and the state security police is gone.
''There are others for whom we could better hold a service of intercession - the people who have lost their jobs already or are about to, and don't have any idea what's to come. There are still others, triumphant nationalists, for whom we could hold a service of penitence. So instead we will simply keep quiet, and let the silence move people to think.''
 
'Knot in My Stomach'
The difficulties that lie ahead are more evident to Germans from the East than those in the West, but they affect both.
Hans-Joachim Richter, a sports instructor whose brother served a year and a half in prison in East Germany for hanging a banner outside his window demanding human rights and freedom to travel, said that he was glad things had changed but that he was worried about how he could earn a living. ''I wake up every morning with a knot in my stomach,'' he said.
His sports job, like many tens of thousands in East Germany, is being done away with next month as the artificial state structures of Communism continue to wither away.
''You have to realize that not only did people have to learn to deal with a new political system and a new currency overnight,'' said Hinrich Lehmann-Grube, who gave up a job as city manager of Hanover, in the west, to become mayor of Leipzig in June. ''They also have to learn to deal with a new system of banking, insurance, apartment leasing, and everything else we in the West learned to take for granted over the past 40 years. It's a lot to deal with in a short time.''
''This is only the beginning of a long and difficult task of rebuilding, not the end,'' the Mayor said of unification. ''I hope we will have the financial help and the time we need to digest what has happened so far, let alone to do what we need in the future.''
 
Of Power Lost and Gained
A Western diplomat predicted that unemployment would soar to 30 or 50 percent of the Eastern German labor force over the next year, in a population of something more than 16 million. And to give an idea of the scale of the necessary reconstruction of the former East Germany's dilapidated and worn-out capital structure, Mayor Lehmann-Grube said that in Leipzig, a city of 556,000, 30,000 apartments need urgent renovation to become habitable again, and 100,000 others are in scarcely better shape.
Some Germans and others think that this task of reconstruction, enormous as it is, is easy and manageable compared with what needs to be done to keep the Soviet Union, Poland, and some other Eastern European countries from becoming dangerous sources of economic and political instability just as menacing as Soviet military might seemed during the cold war.
''We're in the process of seeing one power rise while another disintegrates,'' said a diplomat with long experience of Germany. But the Soviet Union, which exercised a veto on German unification until July, may have lifted it precisely because it is counting on a new alignment of forces in which a German-Soviet reconciliation, on a bigger scale than any seen heretofore, is the central element.
In that case, the question might become whether the many recent expressions of gratitude for United States support and encouragement to Germans and Berliners during the cold war years were only a last hurrah.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
Resentments Rekindled At Border With Poland

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ZGORZELEC, Poland, Oct. 3

 BODY:
It would take more than the midnight fireworks visible across the Neisse River to make the people of this Polish town happy about Germany's reunification.
Officials and private citizens said a bigger Germany makes them feel less assured that this town, which Poland gained from defeated Germany in 1945, will remain Polish.
And across the river in the German town of Gorlitz, which before Germany's defeat extended to embrace this town, concerned Germans reported that anti-Polish feeling had been rising since the ouster of the East German Communist Government that led to reunification.
On both sides of the Neisse, people reported that despite more than 40 years of Communism, under which Poland and East Germany were joined as ''brotherly'' nations and their borders declared eternal by treaty, few personal friendships had been forged between Poles and Germans. This is so even though many Poles work on the German side. 
 
Boycotted Ceremonies
The Mayor of Zgorzelec (pronounced zgo-ZHEH-lets) and his entire City Council boycotted the reunification festivities today, although the Mayor of Gorlitz had invited them.
The specific cause of the Poles' anger was new regulations that went into effect with with unification, requiring Poles to have visas if they want to enter Germany. Before today, Poles had the right of free access to West Berlin without visas, under American, British and French occupation powers that came to an end at midnight.
''Most people here are fearful about united Germany,'' said Deputy Mayor Andrzej Krzywinski. ''History is long, and people don't forget it, especially those who lived through the war.''
He said that it was natural for the Government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki to express approval of reunification. ''That's diplomacy,'' Mr. Krzywinski said. ''But the people have their feelings.''
''Of course the people here are afraid,'' said Joanna Zarebska, a 19-year-old student. ''Whenever the young Germans who came over here in masses drank our beer, they started to shout, 'Zgorzelec must go back to Germany.' ''
 
East German Shoppers
For three months, East Germans coming from all parts of their country flocked here to shop. The influx began July 1, when German currency union gave the Easterners the powerful Western mark and made them for the first time desirable customers. They bought mainly jeans, bicycles and food, at about a third of the German prices.
Christine Marakanow, a reporter for the Sachsische Zeitung, the main regional newspaper for Gorlitz, said the overthrow of communism had brought to the surface sentiments that East Germans once kept to themselves. Gorlitz, an industrial town of 75,000 people, proved a stronghold of the nationalist, conservative Democratic Social Union in parliamentary elections last March.
Mrs. Marakanow, said the West German Federation of the Expelled, the organization pressing the demands of those Germans who were driven from their homes in parts of Poland and Czechoslovakia at the end of the war, had become active in Gorlitz, as had the neo-Nazi Republican Party.
 
'Now I can Say It'
''So far there have been no radical excesses,'' said the journalist, a former Communist. ''But everything is possible now.''
That was apparent in a coffee-house conversation in Gorlitz with a retired engineer from a railroad-car plant in the German town. ''I had trouble after the war because I was an active Hitler Youth leader,'' he said. ''Of course, now I can say it.''
The 66-year-old man, who would not give his name, said he had had good Polish workers under his supervision. Then he offered a 20-minute lecture on what he deemed the national failings of the Poles, reflecting views that appear to be more common in the former East Germany than in Western Germany.
He accused the Poles of being lazy, given to theft and preferring to trade rather than do productive work. For ''trade,'' the engineer used the pejorative verb ''schachern,'' a stock word of German anti-Semitism.
''These feelings are coming out now like from a pot that has been boiling for a long time and has finally had the lid removed,'' said Mrs. Marakanow.
The reporter said that with the virtual certainty of large-scale unemployment, Poles who were tolerated in Gorlitz through the years as workers were now feared as rivals for scarce jobs. Foreign workers are the first to be dismissed in Gorlitz, she said.
Mrs. Marakanow said anti-Polish sentiment was strongest not among the elderly Germans who were expelled from almost all of Silesia, but among the young who had no real desire to go to live in the lands ceded to Poland.
For the first time since 1945, the yellow-and-white Silesian flag is flying again over Silesian territory. In many places in Gorlitz, it enjoys a place of honor next to the national flag of united Germany, which is the same as the banner of the former West Germany.
The journalist said that under Communist rule, the Gorlitz region was forbidden to call itself part of Silesia because that would have been regarded as laying claim to the entire lost province. ''Silesia was meant to be forgotten,'' she said.

Flood-Plagued Town Moving Up to Survive

BYLINE: By DIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ENGLISH, Ind.

 BODY:
Imagine going back to visit your hometown - only to find that it isn't where you left it.
It sounds like an episode from ''The Twilight Zone.'' But it could happen to former residents who haven't kept up with the news back home.
This tiny town about 45 miles west of Louisville, long ravaged by floods, is moving to higher ground. 
''We're packing up and going,'' said Dr. John Merrilees, a dentist who heads the Town Council. ''The only way to save our town is to move it.''
The move, to begin as soon as next year, is one of the largest such projects in the country. This town of 650 people in one of Indiana's poorest counties hopes to raise $6 million from state and Federal agencies for relief and relocation needs in the move.
A heavy rainfall in June pushed water over the banks of the Little Blue River, and floods chased more than 100 residents out of their homes. Residents say that was the last straw. ''The futility of it all really hit us after this last flood,'' said Sara Combs, editor of The Crawford County Democrat. ''People were thinking, 'How many times can we go through this?' ''
The town hired a consultant and subsequently condemned most property in the flood plain in order to force the move, which will affect about 75 percent of English, including about 100 homes and businesses.
''People always figured, There ain't no use in doing anything - there's just going to come another flood,'' said Ethyl Merry. ''So a lot of people just set around and let the water come up around their ears.''
People here know floods aren't the only forces challenging the survival of English. Like many other little towns around the country, English has seen its young move far away from the corn and tobacco fields in search of better opportunities.
The 19th-century clapboard homes are weathered. The business district is pockmarked by vacant lots. A window of a coffee shop downtown is covered with notices for auctions and charity benefits. Even without the floods to fight, the people here know they face an uphill climb.
''If we sit here and do nothing, we know the town won't make it,'' said Owen Grunden, owner of the English Hardware store. ''If we move, well, at least we've got a chance.'' The decision to move met with overwhelming support, despite some sadness.
''I'm really proud of the people of English,'' said Dr. Merillees, whose Scottish immigrant ancestors were homesteaders in Crawford County in the middle of the 19th century. ''They're not going to give up.'' The town is to move to a corn-covered hill about a mile away. Most of the existing buildings would be bulldozed, although officials here hope to move a few of the old gems, like the stone library. The site of the existing town would become a recreational area for golf and tennis.
The project will cost $15 million to $20 million, according to Tony Pappano, a developer who was hired to direct the move. He said most of the homes in town were worth $30,000 to $40,000.
''Crawford County has historically been economically deprived,'' said Mr. Pappano. ''We're hoping this project will bring some money and jobs into the area.''
Town planners hope to retain a flavor of the old town in the new one.
''The architects pointed out that everybody here likes to sit on the front porch,'' said Dr. Merillees. ''It's something we like to do here - sit out on the porch. So we're hoping to have nice front porches on the new homes.''
In the Corner Kitchen cafe, where a stuffed elk on the wall overlooks the midmorning chatter, most of the talk centers on the move. At one table, a daughter and her father disagree.
''If we don't do this, we're a dead town,'' said John Merry, an electrician, who said his great-great-grandfather, who lived to 106, is buried in a field outside of town.
But his daughter, Debbie Pittman, said she couldn't accept the idea of a new hometown.
''If they move English, they might as well just change the name,'' she said. ''It won't be my hometown anymore.''
Like some others here, Mrs. Pittman voiced concern about plans for a new golf course and tennis courts.
''That's going to bring a lot of strange people here,'' she said, and heads all around nodded in concern.

HEADLINE: IMMIGRATION BILL APPROVED IN HOUSE

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
The House today approved broad changes in the country's immigration law that seek to open the nation's doors to three-quarters of a million foreigners a year, particularly educated workers with technical and managerial skills.
By a vote of 231 to 192, the House approved legislation that would increase the number of legal immigrants to 775,000 a year from the current 540,000, speed the process of uniting families and seek to attract a larger pool of highly skilled workers to meet expected labor shortages in fields like engineering, medicine and basic science.
''If this country is to continue to advance, we must not fear the talents and intelligence of those who want to come to this country and contribute their skills,'' said Representative Robert T. Matsui, Democrat of California. ''All Americans owe their citizenship to immigration.'' 
While President Bush has not said he would veto the bill, the Department of Labor and the Department of Justice have warned that they would recommend a veto because the legislation is too heavily weighted in favor of family immigration, at the expense of business-sponsored immigration.
 
Hope for Compromise
But some lawmakers today held out hope for a compromise. They noted that the Senate passed similar legislation that placed a lid on immigration at 630,000 a year, legislation that the White House said it would support. A House-Senate conference to work out the difference could be held as soon as next week, but budget deliberations may not allow time for a vote before Congress recesses.
Under the House bill, legal immigration would rise to 775,000 beginning next year. Of that total more than 500,000 people would be permitted entry on the basis of ties with family members who are either American citizens or have been granted permanent residence status.
The balance would be made up of educated workers sponsored by corporations, under a new expedited process, and greater levels of immigration from areas that in recent years have been under-represented, like Africa, Eastern Europe and Western Europe.
Opponents say the bill would take jobs from Americans and allow an excessively high number of immigrants.
 
Criticism Is Voiced
While the House bill, the Family United and Employment Opportunity Immigration Act, deals with legal immigration and represents the most significant change in immigration laws in more than two decades, it comes four years after one of the most controversial pieces of immigration legislation, a measure that permitted 1.7 million foreigners who had come into the country illegally before 1982 to apply for amnesty from deportation.
The current bill has generated its own debate, but nothing akin to that of four years ago.
Today, Republicans and Democrats questioned how the Government could justify such a major increase in the number of legal immigrants a year.
''We already permit in more immigrants than all of nations of the world combined,'' said Representative John Bryant, Democrat of Texas.
Representative Jim Cooper, Democrat of Tennessee, said, ''Bringing lot of foreigners into the country does not get a lot of support back home.''
 
Turmoil in Administration
The Bush Administation appears to be in some turmoil over the legislation. While parts of the Administration object to some technical aspects of the bill, the President's advisers have embraced the bill's underlying economic policy. The 1990 Economic Report of the President said the ''long-term benefits of immigration greatly exceed any short-run costs.''
Much of the debate centers on economics, and claims by advocates of the bill that promoting immigration of skilled workers would generate economic growth and that these workers would fill critical positions in industries.
While few dispute the humanitarian aim of uniting families, many question whether immigration will actually improve the nation's economy. Instead, they claim that immigrants tend to fill the ranks of those on welfare. Others say that by embracing educated workers from abroad, the country is abandoning citizens like inner-city blacks.
 
Groups Are Singled Out
The bill also singles out specific immigrant groups for special treatment.
For example, the number of visas for Hong Kong residents would increase to 20,000 a year from 5,000, plus an additional 15,000 visas for workers who are employed by American companies in Hong Kong and who can also be employed in the United States.
Countries like Italy, Poland and Argentina would gain thousands of new visas annually under a provision that grants preferential treatment to 55,000 applicants a year from countries that have accounted for less than 50,000 immigrants in the previous five years.
Over the next three years, 14,000 visas would be set aside for citizens of Eastern European countries who have been living in another country since Oct. 1, 1989, 1,000 visas for natives of Tibet living in India or Nepal, and 15,000 visas for natives of African countries. Under another provision, Northern Ireland would be considered a separate region rather than a part of Britain or Ireland.
The law would also grant a stay of deportation and expedited asylum procedures to more than 15,000 refugees from El Salvador, Liberia, Kuwait and Lebanon.

HEADLINE: College Football Plan Puts Games on TV

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Bright Lights, Big College Money'' (editorial, Sept. 15) has a staggering list of indictments of today's college football scene - too long for this reply. But one stands out: your statement that the College Football Association television plan ''bears some resemblance'' to the National Collegiate Athletic Association television plan struck down by the Supreme Court in 1984. 
The College Football Association plan bears no more resemblance to the N.C.A.A. plan than do Lou Holtz's multiple formations to Jock Sutherland's single wing. The College Football Association plan allows every game of every institution to be televised or cablecast if there is a market for it.
In 1983, television viewers saw three college games a weekend; on the day of your editorial, 11 - count them, 11 - games were shown live in the Washington market and 10 in the New York market.
Doing away with the College Football Association agreement would ''make more games available''? Oh, come on. The Federal Trade Commission's action ranks up there with Gerald Ford's ''Whip Inflation Now'' buttons.

HEADLINE: D'Amato Plan to Pay for Police With Capital Funds Spells Ruin

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato's proposal to commit transportation capital funds to hiring more police for New York City (news article, Sept. 17) is the wrong answer to the crime question. It is reminiscent of the infamous shuffle just before the last financial crisis in which capital funds were used to defer the city's cash shortfall. Eating our seed corn guarantees next year's famine.
In a city where working people can find no work, where the poor cannot find housing and where schools fail to give most students sufficient education to hold any job, crime is going to be a problem, for it is the symptom of hopelessness. If that epidemic is not addressed, this city cannot buy enough police to slow or stop crime.
Transportation is this city's principal economic problem. We are heavily truck-dependent for goods, and our trucks must operate on the most crowded highways in the world. That has had a negative impact on blue-collar employment. Employers cannot compete in national markets because of our high transportation costs. The full freight access program, which was to provide this city with modern rail freight services for the first time since the mid-19th century, remains incomplete 16 years after it began because of a shortage of funds and resolve.
Paying for that project with $80 million from idle transportation capital funds is more likely to restore some economic justice to this city than using those funds for police and prisons to deal with the results of its absence.

What's a Mayor Supposed to Do? Give Assurances

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
At a meeting Monday afternoon in Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's Manhattan office, a number of New York City's leading business executives voiced a complaint that some had harbored privately for weeks: they were troubled by what they considered Mayor David N. Dinkins's limp public responses to surging crime and to yawning budget deficits.
Among the two dozen or so people at the session at the World Trade Center, only three defended Mr. Dinkins; two of his longtime friends and political allies, Basil A. Paterson and Percy E. Sutton, and Mr. Cuomo himself.
Mr. Cuomo cannot be seen as undermining a Mayor whom he helped elect, especially not the city's first black mayor. The Governor's political fortunes and the state's economy are inexorably tied to the city's, so neither can Mr. Cuomo afford to be perceived as indifferent to its problems, as Mr. Dinkins had been. But what's a Mayor to do? On Monday, Mr. Dinkins announced a surprisingly generous contract settlement with the teachers' union. Some educators hailed it as an investment in the city's future and even as a potential deterrent to crime - an effective teacher being the best police officer. Other labor leaders hope to replicate it. Not surprisingly, fiscal monitors complained that it was too costly. 
When Mr. Dinkins promised last January to be New York's toughest mayor on crime and two days later postponed hiring more police officers, he was hailed for exercising fiscal prudence. Six months later, he was criticized by many of the same people for responding too slowly to an epidemic of crime.
On Tuesday, when he announced a plan to expand and redeploy the police force, some of his political supporters said it relied disproportionately on apprehension and imprisonment instead of prevention.
City Council members Sal F. Albanese of Brooklyn and Ronnie M. Eldridge of Manhattan said, for example, that a proposed five-year plan to expand drug treatment slots by 50 percent would still serve only about 15 percent of the estimated number of drug abusers in New York City.
Cynics said the Mayor's anti-crime plan was largely contingent on proposed levies - a payroll tax, in particular - that are anathema to the state Legislature.
Whatever its cost or impact on crime, the plan may be sweeping enough to have bought Mr. Dinkins time. It also may deflect some flak to Albany, whose approval is required before the city can tax itself on virtually anything except real estate, and to Washington, where Congress has been pondering a proposed mandatory waiting period before a handgun can be purchased.
Four times during his televised news conference Tuesday evening, Mr. Dinkins offered the Washington telephone number of Thomas S. Foley, Speaker of the House of Representatives.
What is confounding Mr. Cuomo and frustrating some of Mr. Dinkins's critics and supporters alike, though, is that the Mayor has yet to articulate a cohesive plan to reconcile the region's worsening recession with growing financial demands on the city; for higher salaries and for more police officers, and to plug a projected budget gap of more than a billion dollars next year.
''People are asking for an increased level of assurance that the Mayor, personally, has the big picture in mind and has a solution in hand,'' said Allen J. Proctor, executive director of the State Financial Control Board.
''The city is negotiating salary increases when it doesn't have a plan to pay today's employees,'' he said. ''The city is proposing new cops with a certain set of funding when it doesn't have a plan to pay for today's cops.''
Philip R. Michael, Mr. Proctor's predecessor at the board and now the city's budget director, pleads for patience.
''I can understand the frustration when people witness one action, like a labor settlement or police plan, and don't see a counter-balance,'' Mr. Michael said, ''but it can't be done all on the same day.'' Yesterday, after announcements on Monday and Tuesday that would increase spending, Mr. Michael offered the administration's plan to reduce spending by selectively freezing hiring and raises.
During last year's campaign, Mr. Dinkins tried to calm New York's business community, which was worried that he might be a profligate captive of organized labor and of advocates for the poor. ''You can't bargain away what you don't have,'' he said.
If he did, the Financial Control Board, headed by Mr. Cuomo, could reassert its veto power over city spending. That might resolve a budget crisis, but could precipitate a political and social one.
''Raising the specter of that,'' Mr. Proctor said, ''is a reasonable way of influencing actions so that it won't become a likelihood.''

HEADLINE: For Florio, a New Caution Is Emerging

BYLINE: By PETER KERR

DATELINE: TRENTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
The administration of Gov. Jim Florio has emerged from its summer of voter discontent talking a politics of consensus, a moderate kind of talk unheard in the State House just four months ago.
Though the tide of anti-tax rage in New Jersey may have ebbed a bit, the anger of voters has left its mark on an administration that, from the moment it took office in January, prided itself on instituting profound policy changes without regard to polls or considerations of practical politics.
This week, Mr. Florio installed a new chief of staff, Joseph C. Salema, an old friend and political operator from his days as a popular Congressman in Camden County. Mr. Salema immediately eclipsed the influence of the State Treasurer, Douglas C. Berman, the architect of Mr. Florio's $2.8 billion in tax increases, who had developed a reputation as a man who alienated enemies, allies and even other top Florio staff members. 
For the last month Mr. Salema has sent out word to Democratic legislators and interest groups that from now on, the administration will engage more in the practical business of politics, mending fences with allies and trying to build political support before it takes on new initiatives. The clearest example of the administration's new approach came Tuesday with the release of recommendations from the Governor's Commission on Health Care Costs. The commission called for a great change in the state's health care, the kind of change Mr. Florio has said in the past he would like to institute. But on Tuesday Mr. Florio issued only a cautious statement after receiving the report, saying he planned to wait and listen.
 
Looking for a Consensus
''I want to work with everyone involved,'' Mr. Florio said, ''so that we can arrive at a consensus for dealing with this issue.''
Those words were a far cry from the statements Mr. Florio made during his first six months in office, when he announced a battery of initiatives, including major changes in automobile insurance, the financing of education and property taxes, as well as a ban on assault rifles. In those instances he announced the policies he considered to be right, and then left it to the Legislature to tinker with details.
After saying in his 1989 campaign for governor that he saw no need for new taxes, Mr. Florio almost immediately proposed raising the sales tax to 7 percent from 6 percent to cover a growing budget gap. He also proposed increases in income taxes on the most affluent 17 percent of New Jersey residents, in legislation that he said would provide property-tax relief to moderate- and lower-income people and would increase school aid to less affluent districts.
 
No Choice
Administration officials say that with the budget left behind by his predecessor, Thomas H. Kean, and with a crisis in property taxes and public schools, Mr. Florio had no choice but to call for higher taxes. His candor, they argued, would eventually be appreciated by the voters.
But the new taxes made for unpopular politics this summer. Polls showed Mr. Florio's approval rating dropping as low as 23 percent, and the rage was expressed most vocally by lower-middle-class New Jerseyans, the very people Mr. Florio said the plan would help.
Though some members of the Democratic majorities in the Assembly and the State Senate who enacted the increased sales and income taxes in June still praise Mr. Florio as bold, many complain that they were left alone during the summer to bear the anger of constituents who have yet to fully understand Mr. Florio's arguments.
''Where was the air cover from Trenton?'' one Democratic official said.
 
Unusual Personality
In some ways, Mr. Florio's situation grows out of the unusual personality of the man himself. Unlike many elected officials, Mr. Florio has a passion for public policy but a near disinterest in the practice of day-to-day politics. He also distrusts the mass-communications experts who shrink complicated ideas into short phrases.
''Political capital is something you spend to make policy,'' Mr. Florio said in an interview before taking office. ''That's the point of having it.'' By this metaphor, likening political support to money in a bank account, Mr. Florio came into a windfall when he won office last November with 62 percent of the vote.
Administration officials say Mr. Florio brought in Mr. Salema after Mr. Salema argued persuasively that whatever the merits of Mr. Florio's policies, he had gone on a spending spree in his first six months in office. His political bank account was nearly empty, Mr. Salema had argued, and unless the Governor tried a new approach, he would face the politician's equivalent of bankruptcy.
Mr. Salema immediately gathered control of the administration, with the former chief of staff, Steven Perskie, moved out to head the State Casino Control Commission. Mr. Salema promoted two other aides, Andrew Weber and Gregory Lawler, both known for having amiable personalities. Mr. Weber will serve as the Governor's chief counsel, while Mr. Lawler is to help Mr. Salema deal with the Legislature.
 
'Retail Politics'
In an interview this week, Mr. Salema said Mr. Florio would try to build a consensus on major initiatives in the future and would also practice ''retail politics,'' gaining benefits from the dozens of local appearances that any governor makes on not terribly controversial occasions.
''It is the same Jim Florio who sat in Congress,'' Mr. Salema said, ''who was able to bring people together to arrive at solutions. Hopefully, in some cases we can arrive at bipartisan solutions, and nonpartisan solutions. In some cases, we can get things done in a consensus fashion.''
Politicians in Trenton say it is possible for Mr. Salema's strategy to work, rebuilding Mr. Florio's political capital penny by penny.
But for the success of Democrats in the legislative elections next year or Mr. Florio's re-election campaign in 1993, Mr. Salema must hope that the economy does not get too weak. If state revenues fall too far and the Governor is forced to ask for more new taxes, they agree, it could be devastating to Democrats. And Mr. Salema and Mr. Florio must ease the bruised feelings of many politicians and voters who helped elect Mr. Florio just one year ago by a landslide.

HEADLINE: Palestinians Struggling To Rebuild Their Lives

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES

 BODY:
Two years ago, Issam F. Muala was studying civil engineering at a university in his hometown of Ramallah, on the Israeli-occupied West Bank. Today, he is working in a small grocery store in Brooklyn.
Suffering from a self-imposed economic boycott in the occupied territories and the recent loss of thousands of jobs in the Persian Gulf states, many young Palestinian men like Mr. Muala are immigrating to America.
By the thousands, they are arriving in places like the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn, looking for jobs and a little breathing room after three years of struggle in the Palestinian uprising, or intifada. Thousands of miles from the Palestinian diaspora of the Arab world, they are finding themselves equally estranged in a new Palestinian diaspora. 
Back home, despite broad support for their struggle against the Israelis, the Palestinians are stateless, widely scattered and often resented. To many Arabs in America - Yemenites, Egyptians and others - the young Palestinians are traitors for abandoning the fight. Nor do the Arabs look kindly on the allegiance many Palestinians have lent President Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
 
Tortured by Guilt
Palestinians, who with many Lebanese are among the best educated and most liberal people in the Arab world, frequently resent going to work as grocery stockers. They chafe under a lack of affordable educational opportunities and the loss of their social and political prestige. And many say they feel tortured by guilt for having left.
''The Palestinians are a problem,'' said Ragab Ghanem, a Brooklyn deli owner who emigrated from Egypt. ''They caused Egypt to sacrifice so much, to go to war with Israel in 1967 and 1973, and look what they are doing now. They turn against us. They are a hard people.''
According to the American Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, a national organization of Arab groups in the United States, more than half a million Palestinians are in the United States. That number, community organizers and others say, has increased tremendously since the uprising began three years ago. Laila Jammal, a community organizer in Brooklyn, estimated that in Bay Ridge alone, the Palestinian population has grown to about 40,000, from 25,000.
''Every time I go to a wedding or a funeral, I see greater numbers of Palestinians,'' said Mr. Muala, 25 years old. ''People you thought would never leave have come to America. There are about 50 of my university classmates here and 30 or 40 of my friends from my town of Ramallah.''
 
Videos Dubbed in Arabic
Most of the Palestinians in New York settle in Brooklyn, with a large number concentrated between Fourth and Eighth Avenues in Bay Ridge. Arab women, many wearing kerchiefs and long flowing dresses, push children in strollers. Stores sell hummus, falafel and fetira or sanbusak, little pastries of chopped spinach or chard or spiced ground meat and pine nuts. Video shops have movies dubbed in Arabic and several stores have been converted to mosques. One or two coffee shops, the center of life in many Arab communities in the Middle East, struggle to survive, but often cannot because many of the immigrants work 10- or 12-hour days.
''There used to be more coffeehouses, but they closed down,'' said Ms. Jammal. ''The men do not have time in America to sit around and drink coffee. For many this change in life style is the hardest adjustment. There is no time to talk, to build the kind of close relationships that people have at home. There is only time for work.''
Mr. Muala arrived in New York two years ago to finish his civil engineering degree. He was unable to continue his studies at Beir Zeit University in Ramallah after the Israeli authorities closed it in December 1987.
''I came here with $3,000,'' he said, ''but I blew it in one semester at Manhattan College.''
 
'My People Are More Civilized'
Mr. Muala, like many Palestinians, postponed his education and took a low-paying job in a grocery store, a violation of his student visa. He declined to give the name of the store. He sends a few hundred dollars home each month, but his departure torments him.
''My generation started the intifada,'' said Mr. Muala, who said he was jailed four times by the Israeli authorities and helped organize opposition among students. ''We raised the hopes of our parents and our younger brothers and sisters. Now that we leave, it discourages everyone else and it endangers our struggle.''
The Palestinians frequently view other Arabs with open disdain.
''My people are more civilized than other Arabs,'' Mr. Muala said. ''When my boss speaks to me, it is as if I am a charity case, as if I'm begging.''
 
Tied to Menial Jobs
But unhappy as they may be, Palestinians find the trip home is often fraught with difficulties. Because many of the Palestinians refuse to work for Israelis or to buy Israeli products, there are few opportunities for them. And those who stay in the United States for more than a year or obtain green cards often forfeit their Israeli residency cards.
''By the time many want to go home, they can't,'' said Mohammed Hussein, a 26-year-old gypsy-cab driver from the West Bank.
Many find that the few hundred dollars they send home each month has become vital to their families, tying them to their menial jobs.
''My father died last year and my family depends on the money I send them,'' said Suhal Ali, 21, who is from Ramallah and stacks shelves in an Arab-owned grocery store near Prospect Park.
 
'Shame of Not Having Made It'
Palestinian community leaders say the young men are also reticent to return to their villages without the money and degrees they believed they would obtain when they left.
''For a lot of them it is just the shame of not having made it in the United States that keeps them here,'' said a prominent Palestinian community leader who spoke on the condition that he not be identified.
Many of the Palestinian men have little social life. They share small rooms to save money and rarely go out because restaurants and bars are too expensive.
Few Palestinian women come to the United States unless they have close family members who have been here for many years. The men, with meager economic prospects, rarely get invited into the older, more established Palestinian homes and find it difficult to establish relationships.
 
'We Don't Look So Good to Them'
''It is hard to meet a girl here,'' Mr. Hussein said. ''The only girls who are here live with families that have more money than we do. We don't look so good to them. These families often look down on us because we left, and because we don't seem to have much future.''
Palestinians remain convinced, despite Israeli denials, that they are victims of an Israeli plan to depopulate the occupied territories by making life intolerable for Palestinians and by giving menial jobs traditionally held by Palestinians to the Soviet Jews flooding the country.
''The idea is to get rid of us,'' said Mr. Muala, ''and it looks like they are succeeding.''

HEADLINE: 45 Return to the Place Where the Future Began

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
Grown men do not often gather to pay homage to their junior high school, especially when it existed for only seven years.
But a quarter century after their school's founding, the graduates of the Msgr. William Kelly School, a Catholic school for gifted minority and working-class youths, boast of their alma mater with the pride and reverence most people reserve for the tweediest Ivy League institutions.
Last weekend, 45 men reunited in the basement parish hall of a West Side church to celebrate the school and teachers who helped open their eyes to a world beyond cramped housing projects and blue-collar careers. They returned as doctors, lawyers, executives,social workers and, in some cases, with paunches, thinning hair and children in tow. 
''Kelly was a turning point for me,'' said Michael Schneider, a physician who flew in from Ohio to attend the reunion. He grew up in the Bronx, the son of a janitor who had emigrated from Romania. ''It made me optimistic about the future.''
Many said their experiences at the school, which they called simply Kelly, not only awakened them to possibilities, but also to a responsibility to use their talents to improve their communities. The school has produced several public interest lawyers, government officials and entreprenuers who have employed inner-city residents. Many alumni said the epitome of that philosophy was Brother Brian Carty, a teacher and principal at Kelly who was their mentor, friend and booster.
 
'Create and Take Risks'
''We always emphasized that the only change that is going to take place is by us creating that change,'' said Brother Brian, a 46-year-old beefy, bespectacled man whose easy smile is topped by a thick, bushy moustache. ''They did not have to be passive and accept what is, but had to create and take risks.''
The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York took a bit of a gamble itself when it opened the school in 1965 to meet the needs of talented inner-city children who were not sufficiently challenged by the traditional curriculum. The 270-students who attended the school had to pass a stringent test and be recommended by their parochial and public school principals before being admitted to Kelly, which served grades six through eight.
The school benefited from a synergy with the social ferment of the civil rights and Vietnam eras. In contrast to local schools, which reflected the de facto segregation of New York's balkanized neighborhoods, Kelly students came from the five boroughs and all races.
''These kids were all bright and different,'' said Dr. Schneider. ''It was the first time for many with a lot of other black kids or Hispanics.''
 
Big Payoff Came Later
They received an education that emphasized the basics of reading and writing, but also valued independent study and group projects. Courses in psychology, theology, cinema and philosophy and frequent field trips rounded out their education and spurred them to think about their place in the world.
''We told the kids they had the ability and they had to start using their heads,'' Brother Brian said. ''We expected a great deal from them and didn't let them coast.'' He said the payoff came when a number of Kelly's alumni were admitted to New England boarding schools or the city's elite public high schools and later went on to Ivy League colleges.
''Kelly helped me see the big picture,'' said Kevin Allen, a third-year opthamology resident at Harlem Hospital who graduated from Kelly in 1968. ''A lot of kids today don't think they can be leaders, but Kelly brought that across, that the world wasn't just the five blocks up and down my street.''
 
Closed in 1972
Dr. Allen added that the spirit of service he learned at Kelly has influenced him to plan to open an office in the inner city when he finishes his residency. ''There's a huge need in the inner city for eye care, from young people who need glasses for school to old people who have glaucoma.''
Neftali Martinez credited the lessons he learned at the school with having helped him rebuild his life after it was torn apart by drug abuse and a fling with the fast life on the streets. ''If it hadn't been for Kelly I would have been lost or dead,'' said Mr. Martinez, 36, a treatment team leader at Creedmore Psychiatric Hospital who said he used drugs while at Kelly. ''But there was this connection to the world of ideas, Kelly kept me anchored and helped me realize I have this talent.'' He said he now tries to impart the lessons he learned both on the streets and at Kelly to a group of troubled teen-agers that meets regularly at a West Side church.
The Kelly school closed in 1972, the victim of diminished archdiocesan funds and dwindling numbers of the De La Salle Christian Brothers, the religious order that ran the school. But Brother Brian, determined that today's poor urban youths need such a school more than ever, kept alive his dream of reopening the school. In 1984 he and a group of Kelly alumni, many of whom had remained in New York, opened the De La Salle Academy on the Upper West Side, which is supported by donations and a tuition assessed on a sliding scale.
The unfulfilled promises of the 1960's, combined with crack, unemployment and broken families make the job more difficult, and hiring for the school is a more expensive now that most of the 12-member faculty is composed of lay teachers. But Brother Brian vowed to promote the values of service and achievement to a new group of students that he hopes will become a new generation of urban leaders.
His only fear is that they may become victims of their success. ''Too many kids want to leave the city and escape to the suburbs,'' he said. ''But who can blame them?''

HEADLINE: One in 4 Young Black Men Is in Custody, a Study Says

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GLABERSON

 BODY:
Nearly one out of every four young black men in New York State is under the control of the criminal-justice system on any given day, according to a report released today by two private groups that study correction policies.
Calling New York's young black men ''an imprisoned generation,'' the groups said they had conducted the study to call attention to social and economic problems that they said are deepening because of current criminal-justice policies.
Robert Gangi, the executive director of one of the groups, the Correctional Association of New York, said yesterday that the organizations issued the report to challenge what he described as a general policy of building jails instead of creating programs to increase opportunities for young minority men.
''We see what's happening in the criminal-justice system,'' Mr. Gangi said. ''We see that prisons are part of the social institutions that are contributing to the devastation of a people.'' 
 
Local and National Patterns
The Correctional Association, based in Manhattan, and the other group that issued the report, the New York State Coalition for Criminal Justice, based in Albany, both study correctional policies and advocate changes in them.
A national study conducted last winter by a Washington group called The Sentencing Project, an organization that advocates changes in the national corrections policy, found similar patterns across the country.
The New York study found that 23 percent of black men between the ages of 20 and 29 are in state prisons, local jails, on probation or on parole. The number of young black men in custody on any given day - nearly 45,000 - is double the number of black men enrolled in all the colleges in the state, the report said.
The report also found that 12 percent of young Hispanic men in the state are under some form of criminal-justice custody, more than the number of Hispanic men in college in the state.
 
'Possible Racial Inequities'
By contrast, 3 percent of young white men in New York State are in custody, on probation or on parole, the report said. It said 82 percent of the state's inmates are black and Hispanic. It went on to say that this and other statistics ''raise the question of possible racial inequities in the state's sentencing practices.''
Law-enforcement and corrections officials said the report's statistics were accurate, but several of the officials said the disparities in imprisonment rates were not the result of selective enforcement of the law. Instead, they said, the numbers reflected the level of violent crime in minority communities and the lack of access to drug and alcohol treatment and social programs.
Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn District Attorney, said the report highlighted the need for law-enforcement officials to broaden their approach to crime to include education and rehabilitation along with punishment to compensate for the lack of services in many poor neighborhoods.
The report cited a national survey by the National Institute for Drug Abuse, which found that blacks made up 11 percent of people who had used illegal drugs and that Hispanic groups made up 7 percent while whites accounted for 80 percent. Questioning whether New York law enforcement is skewed against members of minorities, the report noted that 95 percent of the inmates currently in New York City jails are black or Hispanic.
Thomas A. Coughlin 3d, the State Correction Commissioner, said minority men are jailed in New York in large numbers because law-enforcement priorities are properly directed against violent crime and because of the harsh realities of life in the state's poorest neighborhoods.
''The law-enforcement community is really not targeting drug use, per se,'' he said. ''What they're targeting is the violence associated with the life style. The Wall Street guys who do cocaine in the board rooms are not out in the street shooting each other for turf.''
Young white men who are arrested for the first time in drug-related crimes, Mr. Coughlin said, are often able to get treatment that is too expensive or not available to many young black men. The result, he said, is that black drug abusers often continue to commit crimes until they are jailed.
Some of those who work with black youths said the statistics about the number of them likely to face prison did not come as a surprise. Teen-agers often learn they must fight to survive in the city's streets, said Geoffrey Canada, the executive director of the Rheedlen Centers for Children and Families in central Harlem.
Mr. Canada said many children in the city's poorest neighborhoods have essentially been abandoned, not only by their parents but also by institutions like churches and schools.
''When kids aren't taken care of, they begin to take care of themselves,'' Mr. Canada said. ''And they are totally unable to do that. When children are left on their own, children come up with 'might makes right.' ''

HEADLINE: Low Voter Turnout in Primaries, Once Again

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Less than 20 percent of those old enough to vote went to the polls in this year's primary elections, according to a study made public this week by an organization that monitors voter turnout.
The report, by the Committee for the Study of the American Electorate, said turnout actually rose in some places, where voters have vented their anger at candidates perceived as being old-fashioned politicians. But in other places, the number of people going to the polls declined as apathy continued to prevail. 
As a result, the study said, the turnout rate for the recent round of primaries was about the same as for the last two midterm election years, 1982 and 1986, but was substantially lower than the rate of voting in primaries as recently as 25 years ago.
The anti-politician mood has been felt this year in a few places, like Massachusetts, Maryland and the District of Columbia. Turnout in the Massachusetts primary was the highest since 1962; in the District of Columbia, turnout was the highest since the city was granted self-rule in 1974.
 
Possible Surge in Fall Voting
But Curtis Gans, director of the committee, said this mood had not become strong enough yet to generate an overall upturn in voting. Of the 26 states that held primaries in both parties in both 1986 and 1990, 12 had higher turnouts and 14 declined.
''It is too early to tell whether the anti-incumbent mood that was reflected in some of the primaries will turn activist and whether it will affect all incumbents, or, as is more traditional, the party which occupies the white House,'' Mr. Gans said.
''There is a possibility of a surge in turnout this fall,'' Mr. Gans said, if voters become mobilized by big issues, like the state of the economy, the Persian Gulf confrontation, the savings and loan scandal, abortion or the new budget deal. ''There are certainly enough issues out there to grab public attention and emotions and propel turnout upward,'' Mr. Gans said.
But he said that such a surge was not visible in overall primary turnout, and that the continuing use of negative campaign tactics would suppress turnout, as it was meant to. ''The essential effect of the campaign conduct is to tell the public not to vote for the opposition,'' he said, ''rather than to encourage them to vote for your candidate.''
All told, 28,701,500 people voted in primary elections this year, or 19.01 percent of the 150,945,000 residents of voting age in those states. The voting age population, derived from the census, overstates the number of eligible voters, since it includes aliens, convicts and those ruled mentally incompetent. But the figures are the only ones available that can be compared from election to election, Mr. Gans said.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Bearish View Pays Off for Funds

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
Mutual funds that based their investment decisions on a gloomy economic outlook outperformed the stock market in the third quarter. Still, as the market fell, so did most equity funds, according to figures released yesterday by Lipper Analytical Services.
On average, general equity funds, which invest in a broad range of stocks, fell by 15.52 percent in the quarter. This compares with a 13.73 percent drop in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index. 
The Lipper report notes that the third-quarter market decline began before the start of the Middle East hostilities, but then accelerated.
 
Dreyfus Tops the List
The quarter's top performer was the Dreyfus Capital Value Fund, which rose 12.96 percent. This $794 million fund was the only general investment fund to rank among the quarter's top 25 performers. All other funds in this group were funds that specialized in gold stocks, foreign currency or energy stocks.
The Dreyfus fund is managed by Stanley Salvigsen, former chief investment stategist at Merrill Lynch and chief executive of Comstock Partners, a money-management firm. Mr. Salvigsen is bearish on both stocks and bonds and says the United States economic system is so fragile that a financial collapse and a depression could be imminent.
This dismal view paid off for Mr. Salvigsen this quarter. With a broad mandate that allows him to invest in stocks, bonds, cash and foreign securities, Mr. Salvigsen bought gold, foreign government securities, and short-term bonds. He held a short position in American securities, including bank stocks, meaning that he sold borrowed stock in the hope of replacing it later with shares bought for less.
''I've been pretty negative on the U.S. stock market, so we are net short in that account,'' Mr. Salvigsen said. ''We feel we're positioned to take advantage of whether the environment is optimistic or negative. We thought this year it might be negative and invested accordingly. So far, it's paid off.''
 
Success for Fidelity
Gold and foreign currency stock funds did well. And rising oil prices also pushed up some energy funds as well. The best-performing energy fund was Fidelity Select Energy, which rose 8.42 percent in the quarter. Frank D. Bracken, manager of the $146 million fund, attributed his fund's performance to ''investor reaction to the oil price run-up, which is a result of tensions in the Middle East.''
Still, he said his fund did better than other energy funds because of his heavy investment in Canadian energy issues and because he ''guessed right'' on large-capitalization stocks like Phillips Petroleum, ARCO Chemical, Maxus Energy and Union Texas Petroleum Holdings.
Even if an end to the Middle East hostilities dampens investors' appetite for energy stocks, Mr. Bracken said, he would still be bullish on the group. ''I still think the business environment will be good for a number of well-positioned activities, so I don't let today's price too dramatically impact my long-term investments,'' he said.
The worst performer for the quarter was the $4 million Prudent Speculator Leveraged Fund, which fell by 46.63 percent. ''Last quarter was a dreadful quarter and we got clobbered,'' said Edwin R. Bernstein, manager of the Los Angeles-based fund. The fund was hurt by its investments in smaller health-care, high-technology and pollution-control stocks. In addition, it had borrowed a considerable amount of money.
As the market fell and investors fled, Mr. Bernstein said, he tried to reduce the amount of borrowings and sell off the fund's weaker holdings. But it was difficult to move fast enough, he said.
''Before we were able to get off our leverage, we got creamed,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''And we concentrated on secondary stocks. That plus Saddam Hussein conspired against us.'' Mr. Bernstein said his fund now had only about $400,000 borrowed for investments, or about 10 percent of its net asset value. At one time, the fund had about $9 million invested and about $4 million borrowed for more investments.
Another big loser was the Bull & Bear's Special Equity Fund, which fell 43.75 percent. This $11 million fund was the second quarter's third best performer. After that good showing, money poured in, betting on the fund's eclectic philosophy of investing in over-the-counter stocks. As the quarter begain, the fund had $33 million in assets.
But as the market fell, investors began to pull out of the fund, forcing it to sell many holdings at depressed prices.
''Most of our money was hot money,'' said Brett B. Sneed, the fund's portfolio manager. ''When the Kuwaiti situation hit, we had a large number of investors switching out. That hit at a time when the market was down. That, coming at a time when many of the O-T-C stocks had virtually no liquidity, meant that we got hit pretty hard.''

HEADLINE: Federated and Allied Outline Recovery Plan

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Eight and a half months after filing for bankruptcy protection, the corporate owners of Bloomingdale's, Abraham & Straus, Jordan Marsh and other big stores yesterday presented a sweeping business plan that they said was the first step toward becoming solvent by next year.
The six-year plan by Federated Department Stores and the Allied Stores Corporation calls for improving store merchandise, further centralizing buying decisions, investing $1 billion to remodel stores and closing an undetermined number of unprofitable stores.
Industry analysts and executives who sell goods to Federated and Allied generally viewed the plan as cautious and conceptual, rather than ambitious or specific, But they said that given the sluggish retail trend and the decline in consumer confidence since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August, the plan was probably prudent.
 
Formal Plan Due Next Year
Federated and Allied's top managers have insisted all along that the stores' heavy burden of merger debt, not their performance, was responsible for the companies' problems. 
They have said all their store divisions are profitable. After hearing the plan's details yesterday, some retailing experts said the two chains appeared to be trying to hold on until the business climate improves rather than sell off a few store divisions for quick cash, as many had expected.
The plan was offered to reassure creditors, who are owed more than $7 billion. Allied and Federated have until Feb. 28 to submit a reorganization plan to the Federal Bankruptcy Court in Cincinnati, where they are based. That plan will have to give specifics on big financial changes and how much creditors will be paid.
 
'A Reasonable Plan'
''It sounds like a reasonable plan, but it's really just an overview so far,'' said one supplier, Bernard Chaus, the chairman of the fashion apparel company that bears his name. ''We await more details. It's a good move, though, because as far as it goes it's reasonable and pragmatic.''
An analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity said: ''When they talk of only $1 billion renovation expenditures in six years, you have to be skeptical when in a very tough retailing environment, big retailers are spending hundreds of millions to open new stores. The budget sounds like too little for stores that are maturing.''
Allen I. Questrom, who is chairman and chief executive, and James M. Zimmerman, the president and chief operating officer of Federated and Allied, said the new business plan would double the companies' operating profits in the next six years, to 11 to 12 percent of sales, from the current 6 to 7 percent. That measure would be profits before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, totaling $782 million in 1993 and $1.2 billion in 1996 against $486 million projected for 1990.
But the two executives told reporters at a news conference in Manhattan that the plan projected no growth in 1990 or 1991 for their 260 stores. ''We see a recession in the fourth quarter of 1990 and the first three quarters of 199l,'' Mr. Zimmerman said. ''So we expect no help from the economy.''
In addition to Bloomingdale's and Abraham & Straus, based in New York, and Jordan Marsh, based in Boston, Allied and Federated's major store divisions are Stern's, in Paramus, N.J.; Burdines, in Miami; Rich's/Goldsmith's, in Atlanta; Maas Brothers-Jordan Marsh, in Florida; Lazarus, in Cincinnati, and Bon Marche, in Seattle.
 
No Mention of Campeau
At the news conference, the two executives frequently used words like ''realistic'' and ''confident'' in describing their plan. They said it would raise the chains' 1990 sales of $7.2 billion to $8.03 billion in 1993 and to $9.88 billion in 1996.
But the one word that seemed oddly missing in the hour-long news conference was ''Campeau.'' It was the Campeau Corporation, the Toronto real estate developer that bought Allied in 1986 and Federated in 1988, amassing more than $9 billion in debt, that pushed both companies into insolvency.
Mr. Questrom and Mr. Zimmerman declined to specify in what period stores would be modernized. They said, however, that unprofitable stores would be eliminated over a period of time, to allow better use of assets. But both executives declined to specify how many or which stores would be closed.
One central part of the plan is actually an extension of something the companies have done for several months: a ''team'' concept of merchandising and buying in which executives in the Federated Marketing Services, the New York buying office, and in the divisions concentrate on building up a particular category of merchandise.
Eventually, as these ''teams'' progress, as much as 70 percent of a department's sales could be involved with the goal of finding those items that sell well enough to significantly build up market share and profits, Mr. Questrom said.
The new business plan is the first of two steps needed by Federated and Allied to emerge from bankruptcy, Mr. Questrom and Mr. Zimmerman stressed. Perhaps more important will be the plan for reorganization, due in February. If approved by the bankruptcy judge and the creditors, it would in effect remove Federated and Allied from bankruptcy.
Mr. Questrom and Mr. Zimmerman declined to estimate what the settlement offer to creditors might be or when the company might return to overall profitability.

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Rebound Nearly 10%

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Oil prices jumped nearly 10 percent yesterday in futures trading, regaining more than half the ground they had lost in the first two days of the week, on what traders acknowledged was minor news from the Middle East: President Saddam Hussein of Iraq had visited Kuwait.
Illustrating the groping by participants to explain the market's movements, one trader mentioned an announcement that the Iraqi Ambassador to the United Nations had delayed a speech by a day.
In trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude for delivery next month was up $3.37 a barrel to $37.32. Gasoline settled up 6.21 cents, at 93.14 cents, and heating oil was up 7.38 cents, at 99.41 cents. 
 
A Feverish 30 Minutes
''The market really took off in the last half-hour; it's difficult to pinpoint as to why,'' said Nauman Barakat, the senior energy trader at Merrill Lynch Futures. But Mr. Hussein's trip to Kuwait showed that ''there is little reason for us to hope that he's going to be conciliatory,'' Mr. Barakat said.
Thomas P. Blakeslee, an energy analyst at the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J., said, ''The psychological factor is so strong that the market is susceptible to any type of news.'' He added that a ''gulf crisis multiplier effect'' caused the market to move $3 or $4 now for events that would have moved it $1 in more stable times.
Mr. Blakeslee said statistics released Tuesday evening by the American Petroleum Institute, which showed a reduction in crude inventories of more than 9 million barrels in the preceeding week, would not have ordinarily moved markets much, but they probably did so yesterday.
 
Testing a New High
''A lot of people are saying we're going to test a new high,'' he said. Last Thursday oil reached $40.10 a barrel before closing at $39.54.
At the Institute for International Economics in Washington, Philip K. Verleger Jr., a visiting fellow, said while the market was unusually volatile, its general level was justified by the balance of supply and demand for ''light'' products, including gasoline, aviation fuel, heating oil and diesel fuel.
Mr. Verleger, a commodities expert, said regulators could reduce volatility by raising the margin requirements, or the capital reserves that participants in the futures market must maintain for each contract they hold. That would force out some participants, he said.
 
Jet-Fuel Supplies Tight
Mr. Verleger and others said the market was becoming particularly tight for jet fuel. He and other experts believe that if the confrontation in the Middle East results in damage to refineries in Saudi Arabia, the disruption in world oil markets would be felt especially sharply in the jet-fuel market, because military needs, now met from those refineries, would have to be supplied instead from Europe and the Pacific.
Then, experts said, civilian requirements would have to be met by American refineries. But aviation fuel, most of which moves by pipeline, would have to be shipped overseas in clean tankers. Since very little oceanic traffic now exists in such fuel, few if any ships are currently set up to carry the fuel. Tankers in other service could be cleaned and used, but the work would have to be done in shipyards, experts say, and this would take time.
Meanwhile, the price of consumer oil products was reported to be continuing to rise sharply yesterday, although not so sharply as in Europe and Japan, meaning that further increases are likely, or supply will be diverted to those markets.
 
Consumer Agency's Report
The New York State Consumer Protection Board in Manhattan reported yesterday that heating oil was $1.31 on Oct. 1, up 11.5 cents in a week and 35.6 cents since Aug. 3, the day after Iraq invaded Kuwait. Gasoline was $1.41 for a gallon of unleaded, up 4.1 cents for the week and by 26.1 cents since Aug. 3.
''Gasoline and home heating oil price increases are unacceptable when you consider there is a plentiful supply and low demand,'' said Richard M. Kessel, the board's chairman. ''Consumers face a disastrous winter if these price increases are allowed to continue.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Sales Of Vehicles Down 3.7%

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Oct. 3

 BODY:
United States vehicle sales dropped 3.7 percent in late September compared with a strong period a year ago, but analysts said today that the results were surprisingly strong in light of recent negative economic developments.
On a seasonally adjusted basis, domestic cars were selling at an 8.2 million rate for the Sept. 21-30 period, compared with a 7.9 million rate last year at this time. Car sales were 236,375, compared with 265,772 last year, a one-tenth of 1 percent increase when taking into account eight selling days in the latest period compared with nine selling days last year. 
Light-truck sales, including the sales of mini-vans, were off 10.3 percent, totaling 119,330 units, compared with 149,652 units last year.
 
Analyst 'a Little Puzzled'
''I'm a little puzzled,'' said David Healy, automotive analyst for Barclays de Zoete Wedd Research Inc. ''There's not as much reaction as I would have thought to lower consumer confidence, higher gas prices and the whole Mideast mess.'' He noted that auto makers were offering large rebates for even their newest models.
Robert L. Rewey, Ford's vice president of sales operations, said sales have been stronger than expected for two months, considering economic conditions. He said he hoped consumer confidence might rebound in the wake of a deficit reduction agreement and possible cuts in interest rates.
For the month, total United States car sales, including import and domestic models, were 783,746, a drop of 3 percent when taking into account 24 selling days this year compared with 25 days last September. Sales of light trucks dropped 11.1 percent, to 344,235. Sales of cars and trucks declined 5.6 percent, to 1,127,981.
The General Motors Corporation, the nation's leading auto maker, suffered a large decline for the month. Light-truck sales dropped 18.6 percent, to 135,280, while car sales dropped 6.5 percent, to 286,104. A year ago G.M. was offering extremely large discounts, which tended to inflate their results for one month, a spokesman said.
The Ford Motor Company's monthly car sales dropped 2.7 percent, to 163,431, from a year ago, and truck sales dropped 2.3 percent, to 105,521, from a year ago.
The Chrysler Corporation posted a 9.8 percent decline in car sales, to 73,648 for the month, and a 20.2 percent decline in truck sales, to 57,315.
 
Japanese Auto Makers Gain
The Japanese auto makers continued to gain market share as a result of rising production at their United States-based assembly plants. Honda Motor Company's sales of United States-produced cars rose 34.2 percent for the month to 37,978; Toyota Motor Corporation's sales of United States-based cars rose 38.3 percent, to 22,262, and the Nissan Motor Company's sales of United States-based cars rose 84.8 percent, to 12,544.
The Big Three auto makers had 63.7 percent of the sales in the United States car market during the month, counting domestic and imported models, while Japanese auto makers accounted for 26.9 percent of the market. Last year at this time the Big Three had 65.4 percent and the Japanese auto makers had 24.9 percent.
Non-Japanese imported cars captured 9.4 percent of the market, compared with 9.7 percent a year ago.

HEADLINE: Trade Break for Soviets May Be Speeded by U.S.

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
The Administration is considering whether to make Federal guarantees of commercial bank loans immediately available for Soviet purchases of American goods, even before the enactment of Soviet emigration law that President Bush has set as a condition for tariff concessions.
A senior Administration official, who asked not to be identified, said such action was being sought by the business and farm communities and their supporters in the Cabinet, who argue that the United States would benefit from increased exports.
Otherwise, these people say, the United States would be at a competitive disadvantage against Japan and Western European nations that do provide such guarantees. 
 
Incentive To Soviet
Some State Department officials, who have been sounding out members of Congress on the idea in recent days, cite an additional motive: the incentive it might offer the Soviet Parliament to pass long-delayed emigration legislation.
''The credits help us,'' a proponent of the move said. ''It's the lowering of tariffs that helps the Soviets.''
A White House official said there had been no change in the President's announced policy of normalizing trade relations once the Soviet Parliament acts and declined to discuss any internal deliberations on moving ahead first with credit guarantees.
Under the plan, the President would temporarily waive the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the Trade Act of 1974, which bans tariff concessions and Government credit to countries that prevent substantially free emigration.
But Mr. Bush would hold back from Congress the trade agreement that would reduce tariffs against Soviet products to the most favored nation rates - the lowest level granted to any other country.
Currently Soviet products sold in the United States bear duties as much as 10 times higher than imports from other countries.
The result would be to give both the Export Import Bank and the Commodity Credit Corporation immediate authority to provide Federal guarantees of commercial bank loans to back exports to the Soviet Union.
The loans would go to the Soviet purchasers of the American products and would in turn be guaranteed by the Soviet Bank of Foreign Economic Affairs, which controls most foreign exchange in the Soviet Union.
This second guarantee has become a requirement, American officials noted, after the difficulties Soviets have faced in recent months in meeting some repayment obligations.
The Soviets have lately been selling commodities, including gold, to wipe out more than $2 billion of unpaid bills from Western suppliers.
The Commodity Credit Corporation, a unit of the Agriculture Department, provided $5 billion of guarantees for commercial bank loans to back up crop purchases by 25 countries last year.
Dealing with the United States on a largely cash basis, Moscow bought $3.3 billion of American farm products last year. The Soviets have cautioned that without American credit, new purchases will be far lower. American farmers, wrestling with oversupply, are especially anxious to hold on to foreign markets.
The Export Import Bank, an independent agency founded 55 years ago, provides $8.7 billion of commercial loan guarantees to about 50 countries.
Despite the confusion in the Soviet Union over economic reforms, many American companies are planning Soviet joint ventures.
Companies like Upjohn, planning Soviet pharmaceutical plants, and International Business Machines, planning to sell tens of thousands of personal computers, are seeking Export Import Bank credit guarantees to support their ventures.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Chase Buying 2 Units Of Dollar Dry Dock

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The Chase Manhattan Corporation announced plans yesterday to acquire two branches with $330 million in deposits from the Dollar Dry Dock Bank.
No price was disclosed for the branches, which are on Long Island, at Jericho and Rockville Centre.
A spokeswoman for Dollar Dry Dock, Linda Lockhart, said the bank was selling the branches because it did not have enough offices on Long Island to be an effective competitor. She said the company was expanding in Queens and Westchester County. 
Chase is expanding its profitable consumer banking business even though it will eliminate 5,000 jobs and cut activity in other areas.
''While we are restructuring, we still have the ability and intention to invest in the parts of our business that can make a difference,'' said Donald L. Boudreau, executive vice president at Chase. He said retail businesses were among those where profit and growth opportunities justified new investments.
In the last year, Chase has added 16 branches in the New York City area and nine in the Syracuse area. The largest acquistion was $1 billion of deposits and 11 branches from the failed Seaman's Bank for Savings.
Mr. Boudreau said that buying branches was more economical than opening new ones and that the bank would announce more branch acquisitions by the end of the year.
Chase's consumer banking business grew rapidly in the 1980's, producing profits of $332 million in 1989. Although the weakened economy has slowed growth, Mr. Boudreau said retail growth would continue ''at a double digit rate'' while profits remained high.
Last month, Chase announced it expected a loss of $625 million in the quarter that ended Sept. 30 because of bad real estate loans and the costs of reducing its work force. At midyear, Chase had assets of nearly $102.4 billion and was the nation's third-largest banking company.
Chase's stock fell 62.5 cents yesterday, to $11.25, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Factory Orders Rose 1.8% in August

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Rising oil prices helped push up the value of orders to factories for manufactured goods by 1.8 percent in August, the Government reported today. Analysts said the oil-inflated rise disguised the weakness in the industrial sector.
''To me, the number excluding petroleum is consistent with our view that the economy is sliding and slipping into a recession,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist with the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis. 
Bruce Steinberg, senior economist with Merrill Lynch Capital Markets in New York, added: ''It continues to show the industrial sector is going nowhere and may be sinking a little bit. There's nothing in the report to say we're not having a recession.''
The Commerce Department said orders for both durable and nondurable goods totaled a seasonally adjusted $244.6 billion, but added, ''Most of the increase is attributed to the petroleum refining industry. Excluding petroleum, orders increased 0.6 percent.''
Mr. Sohn said ''energy prices went up even more dramatically in September and orders then will be even more exaggerated.'' He suggested the reports should be examined excluding petroleum costs and ''my expectation is that orders will continue to soften.''
 
Nondurable Goods Orders
Overall nondurable goods orders, which include petroleum, advanced 4.4 percent, to $117.1 billion, in August including a $3 billion rise in the petroleum and coal category. Nondurable orders had edged up just two-tenths of 1 percent in the month before the Aug. 2 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.
Orders for durable goods - big-ticket items expected to last more than three years - fell five-tenths of 1 percent, to $127.5 billion, after rising 2.7 percent in July. The drop in August orders was a slight downward revision from the eight-tenths of 1 percent decline first reported last week.
The often-volatile military orders also jumped following the Iraqi invasion, up 14.4 percent, to $8.6 billion, after declining 5.1 percent a month earlier. Excluding the military, orders were up 1.4 percent.
But orders for nonmilitary capital goods, a barometer of business plans for expansion and modernization, indicated a cautious investment attitude. Orders plunged 10.2 percent, to $35.8 billion, erasing a 10.1 percent advance in July.
Among durable goods, electrical machinery orders were up 2.9 percent, to $20.9 billion, after rising 1.5 percent in July. Transportation orders rose 1.8 percent, to $35.4 billion, after a 4.6 percent gain a month earlier. Excluding transportation, orders were up 1.8 percent.
''Within transportation, increases in motor vehicles and parts and shipbuilding and tanks more than offset a decline in aircraft and parts,'' the report said.
Registering losses were non-electrical machinery, down 5.0 percent, to $21.4 billion, following a 3.5 percent gain, and primary metals, which fell 2.3 percent, to $11.5 billion, after a 2.7 percent rise.

HEADLINE: Ex-Official In Defense Of Record

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Edwin J. Gray, the chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board during the Reagan Administration, portrayed himself today as a besieged regulator who was ''consistently'' snubbed by the Treasury Secretary and the Federal budget director and overruled by the personnel director.
His testimony before the House Banking Committee, like that on Monday by Donald T. Regan, who was President Ronald Reagan's first Treasury Secretary and second White House chief of staff, portrayed the Reagan Administration as engaged in internecine warfare on issues affecting the savings and loan industry.
''Regan and Stockman refused consistently and without exception to return my calls or to communicate,'' Mr. Gray said, referring to David A. Stockman, the former director of the Office of Management and Budget. The committee is investigating the origins of the savings and loan crisis. 
 
Supported Regulation
Mr. Gray portrayed himself as an advocate of strong regulation at odds with those in the White House, like Mr. Regan, who supported deregulation.
Mr. Regan told the committee on Monday that he had sought to dismiss Mr. Gray and did not recommend his reappointment because he considered Mr. Gray ineffective.
Mr. Gray, chairman of the board from 1983 to 1987, said today that Mr. Regan ''has a habit of personally denigrating fellow citizens who may not share, or who challenge, his views.''
One point at issue, Mr. Gray said, was his campaign against allowing savings institutions to make direct investments. On this issue, as in others, he was overruled by the White House, which refused to give him the enforcement authority he needed.
''Don Regan never initiated any actions - either him personally or the Cabinet council under him - to help cut F.S.L.I.C.'s and the taxpayer's losses, nor did he lift a finger to help me or my agency,'' Mr. Gray said. F.S.L.I.C., the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, insured deposits at savings institutions regulated by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board and state regulators.
The Office of Management and Budget overruled his proposals for tighter restrictions, Mr. Gray said, while the Office of Personnel Management overruled his requests for more bank examiners, including a request to increase their annual salaries beyond $14,300.
Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, told the committee that it was poor lending policies, rather than high interest rates, that led to the savings and loan crisis.
Mr. Volcker also said that the Federal Home Loan Bank Board's staff, experienced in evaluating loans on residential properties, ''didn't have the background'' to evaluate the broad new transactions that involved commercial real estate.

HEADLINE: S.&P. 500 Outdoes Money Managers

BYLINE: By ALISON LEIGH COWAN

 BODY:
After a punishing third quarter, the nation's money managers saw the estimated value of their portfolios decline an average of 14.5 percent in the first nine months of the year, according to CDA Investment Technologies, a Rockville, Md., firm that tracks money management performance.
Though recent Middle East tensions and a soft economy have put pressure on many stocks, a CDA report released yesterday shows that the money managers as a group underperformed the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, by 3.4 percentage points. That nine-month performance was a far cry from their position at the end of the second quarter, when they were up 3.1 percent for the year, one-tenth of a percentage point ahead of the S.&P. index.
To come up with individual rankings, CDA uses periodic filings that money managers make with the Securities and Exchange Commission to compute the return that would have been earned assuming that money managers ended the quarter with the same basket of stocks that they began it. 
 
Outside the Calculation
Those public filings show which stocks were owned at the end of the previous quarter, but do not indicate which stocks may have been bought or sold in the interim. Nor do they show when money managers take short positions - or sell borrowed stock, hoping to profit by replacing it with shares bought later for less - a strategy that would have paid off handsomely this past quarter.
While CDA's estimates therefore exclude some important information, they have proved to be a fair indicator of performance over time for money managers other than those who hold a few stocks or who trade actively.
The latest report, which tracked 488 money managers, indicates that the drubbing was pretty much across the board, with 9 of the 10 best performers down for the period. At the cutoff point of the top-10 list was Lynch & Mayer Inc. of New York, down 3.7 percent for the nine months.
Willoughby, Holin & Rentner in Plantation, Fla. led the list of money managers with at least 10 stocks in their portfolio. Michael Harris, the firm's chief investment officer, attributed the strong relative performance to the recent run-up in energy stocks that was kindled by the Persian Gulf crisis. ''The third quarter was far and away our good quarter, and the energy stocks helped us a lot,'' said Mr. Harris, who noted that 25 percent of the firm's portfolio was in energy plays like British Petroleum, Apache, Western Company, Mobil and Burlington Resources.
 
Recession Resistance
Mel Tukman, president of Tuckman Capital Management in Larkspur, Calif. attributed his firm's strong ranking to its holding of traditional stalwarts like Ralston Purina and Philip Morris, both consumer product companies that have some recession resistance.
The worst performance for the quarter was turned in by Harvey Sandler, whose 32 stocks finished the nine months down an estimated 46.7 percent, according to CDA.
Mr. Sandler did not return phone calls seeking comment. But George Kellner, managing partner of Kellner, DeLeo & Company, an arbitrage firm that CDA also placed in the bottom quadrant with a drop of 23.6 percent, challenged the relevance of the rankings.
''I'm not going to tell you how I did, but I'm not down a lot,'' said Mr. Kellner, who said that the information in the public filings was ancient, especially in his case, since his firm tends to file them late to prevent other investors from knowing their positions.
As always, concentrating a portfolio around a smaller universe of companies tended to distort some managers' performance. The only manager who was said to be ahead for the year, Lampert L.P., had only one stock, Union Texas Petroleum Holdings Inc., in its portfolio as of June 30, the cutoff date that CDA uses in its estimates. A Lampert official said the 18.2 percent return cited by CDA did not accurately portray the firm's performance, though he declined to release the true performance. Robert Levy, the chairman of CDA, conceded that the top ranking was probably an aberration that grew out of the way the results were calculated.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in World Trading With Lower Rates Foreseen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar declined on world currency markets yesterday amid expectations that interest rates would move lower.
The dollar slumped after an endorsement of the proposed budget agreement by Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. He told Congress that the five-year, $500 billion deficit-reduction package would ''lessen pressures in credit markets.''
Though he did not specifically promise to lower interest rates, Mr. Greenspan said he ''most certainly'' believed an enacted agreement would exert downward pressure on rates.
Lower interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less attractive, thereby reducing investors' need for the American currency.
Trading was light, which exacerbated the dollar's move downward.
Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar eased to 136.65 yen, from 136.73 yen on Tuesday. Later in London, the dollar fell to 135.15 yen. In New York, the currency closed at 136.04 yen, down from 136.72 yen on Tuesday.
In London, a pound cost $1.8990, more than $1.8890 late Tuesday. In New York, it cost $1.9025 to buy a pound, up from $1.8930 on Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late Tuesday, included: 1.5420 German marks, down from 1.5495; 1.2835 Swiss francs, down from 1.2885; 5.1660 French francs, down from 5.1915; 1,155.75 Italian lire, down from 1,160.75, and 1.1516 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1527.
In Europe, other late dollar rates yesterday, compared with late Tuesday, included: 1.5435 German marks, down from 1.5540; 1.2845 Swiss francs, down from 1.2900; 5.1747 French francs, down from 5.2050; 1.7410 Dutch guilders, down from 1.7502; 1,160.25 Italian lire, down from 1,162.75, and 1.1516 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1532.

HEADLINE: Among Farmers, Anger Greets Prospect of Cuts

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Members of the House and Senate Agriculture Committees began drawing up formulas today for cutting farm program spending $13 billion over the next five years as farmers across the country expressed frustration and anger over the prospect of a reduction in their incomes.
''We're not happy about it - nobody is when they're told their income is going to be reduced,'' said Tommy Fondren, a cotton grower from Lorenzo, Tex. ''But I don't know what we can do about it. If the Government doesn't have the money, it doesn't have the money. It's going to produce some severe hardship here. No doubt about that.'' 
But despite this frustration, spokesmen for both parties said they did not expect the political repercussions to be substantial in most rural districts because many incumbents are unopposed or are being challenged by weak opponents.
In Texas, for example, Larry Combest, a Republican, and Charles W. Stenholm, a Democrat, represent the largest and second-largest cotton-growing Congressional districts in the country. Each of the districts could lose $15 million or more annually in farm subsidy payments for cotton. Neither lawmaker has an opponent this fall.
 
Where Cuts Are an Issue
But in a handful of close races in other farming regions, the cuts in spending that were announced Sunday by President Bush and Congressional leaders are emerging as an important issue. In Nebraska's Third Congressional District, which covers most of the state and produces more corn than any Congressional district in the country, two state senators, Bill Barrett, a Republican, and Sandra Scofield, a Democrat, are running to succeed Representative Virginia Smith, a Republican, who is retiring.
Nebraska corn farmers received $400 million in direct farm payments in 1989, and most went to growers in the Third District. The budget cuts could reduce payments to Nebraska $60 million or more annually, and this prospect has added tension and tightened the race, staff members of both campaigns said.
''The budget negotiations have been an issue because it's not a great time to destabilize an already fragile economic situation,'' said Ms. Scofield, a farmer, who serves on the Nebraska legislature's budget committee. ''I have experience balancing budgets. I was raised on a farm. And there's nothing more important for this district than to have somebody in Congress who can explain rural issues and agricultural issues to urban members of Congress.''
The budget agreement calls for cutting farm program spending $13 billion over the next five fiscal years, or roughly 25 percent of the $54 billion to $56 billion that Congress and the Department of Agriculture expected to spend on farm programs.
The agreement calls for the cuts to begin with a $1.3 billion reduction this fiscal year. Lawmakers said this decrease could cause more pain than any other. The reason is that $4.2 billion of the $7.8 billion that the Agriculture Department expected to spend on farm programs this year is already obligated under contracts between growers and the Government.
 
Effect on Five Crops
That leaves $3.6 billion from which to cut $1.3 billion. Most of this money is tied up in payments to growers of five crops - corn, wheat, rice, cotton and sorghum - and to buy and store surplus milk.
Members of the House and Senate Agriculture Committees, who have been meeting to resolve differences in five-year farm policy laws passed by each house during the summer, said they were looking to other parts of the Agriculture Department's budget to seek savings.
''We'll look at the Agriculture Secretary's salary, the National Agriculture Library budget - everything is on the table,'' said Representative E. (Kika) de la Garza, Democrat of Texas, and chairman of the House Agriculture Committee. ''But if you look at where the big money is, you see we really don't have too many places to go.''
Several large farm groups today said they were starting to organize campaigns to prevent or reduce the cuts. ''We don't feel the amount of cuts in the agriculture sector are equitable,'' said Michael Dunn, a vice president in Washington for the National Farmers Union, which repesents 250,000 farmers across the country.
Gov. George A. Sinner, of North Dakota, a Democrat, said the budget cuts, which could slash Federal farm payments in his state $60 million to $100 million a year, are coming at a time when wheat prices are at the same level they were at the turn of the century.
''We're losing a ton of farmers this year,'' said Mr. Sinner. ''It's been bad before. It's devastating now.''

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET AGREEMENT;
Deficit Pact Blurs Party Boundaries

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
To break a decade of budget deadlock, President Bush and Congressional leaders swept away the normal process of budget making and produced a compromise that illustrates just how hazy the line between the two parties, and between the White House and Capitol Hill, has become in Washington.
The budget compromise was the ultimate example of a kind of government by ad-hoc coalition that has left many politicians in both parties confused about when to clash and when to cooperate. It also underscored the degree to which campaign-wary members of Congress have become addicted to closed-door negotiations in a Capitol where budgets used to be made in long, wearying - but open - committee proceedings.
President Bush and Senator George J. Mitchell, the Democratic majority leader, hailed the compromise as a model of responsible bipartisanship, but a growing number of politicians see it as a muddling of the traditional distinctions between Democrats and Republicans and another example of the distancing between Washington and the rest of the nation. 
 
Washington vs. the People
''What we're seeing today is a strengthening of the two-party system in this nation, the party inside Washington, D.C., and the party of the people outside,'' said Virginia's Democratic Governor, L. Douglas Wilder.
The budget compromise was made necessary by a problem not often recognized in classroom lectures on American government. One of the longest periods of divided government in American history has produced political paralysis and budget deficits that threaten the nation's economic health.
The old budget system, created in 1974 to impose discipline on a process with no structure, was not working. The budget process remained hamstrung by competing committees and interest groups. So now a handful of men are trying to override the system with the compromise budget they arranged, and are seeking to enact it in less than three weeks, a period stunningly short by the standards of Congressional budget making.
While Washington focused today on whether Congress would approve the package, Thomas Mann, a scholar at the Brookings Institution, said that what is remarkable is not that Congress might reject the deal but that it is even faintly possible that the House of Representatives, which under the Constitution is supposed to initiate fiscal measures, might approve a plan presented as a fait accompli by a small group of negotiators.
 
Breaking Rules
''It's not the way Congress is supposed to work,'' said Mr. Mann. ''You're not supposed to cut a deal and implement it three weeks later. This is an extraordinarily centralized and expedited process, one that a decade ago would have seemed so unnatural as to be impossible.''
There is a price to be paid for this, as the screams from backbenchers in both parties, and from the hinterlands, made clear.
Members in each party worry that their party has grown complacent and accepting of a status quo in which Republicans cooperate sporadically in a form of coalition government with few guidelines or set procedures. Two of the strongest critics of the budget compromise are a Democrat who might like to be President, Governor Mario M. Cuomo of New York, and a Republican who would definitely like to be Speaker of the House, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia.
Even the address by Senator Mitchell on Tuesday was the speech of a man struggling, a little uncomfortably, to maintain some partisan difference while announcing that he was working with the President to pass the budget. Congressional officials said he had not wanted to give the speech and had asked Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader, to do it. Mr. Gephardt declined, saying he had given the speech in which Democrats said they stood with the President on the Persian Gulf situation.
 
Parliamentary Style
There have, of course, been past efforts to break legislative logjams with big compromises. A bipartisan commission led by Alan Greenspan brokered a deal in 1983 to put Social Seurity back on a sound financial footing by raising taxes and restraining benefits. But a similar commission to eliminate the budget deficit foundered when Mr. Bush took his no-new-taxes stand in the 1988 campaign.
The sheer magnitude of this agreement sets it apart, as does the manner in which lawmakers created a crisis, the potential for deep across-the-board-cuts under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law, and then used that crisis as the reason to override the budget system itself.
This grand agreement style of resolution is more akin to the workings of a coalition government under a parliamentary system than the separated powers the framers of the Constitution designed as a specific rebellion to concentrated power.
''It blurs the role of Congress and the people's representatives,'' said Representative Mickey Edwards of Oklahoma, one of the leading Republicans in the House. ''You have government by a small handful of elected leaders. Its not an autocracy. At least they are elected by someone. But it carries the old boss system a step even further. It really is not a good way to legislate.''
 
Adapting to Division
There has been a tendency to explain the budget stalemate as the result of a flawed process, something that could be resolved if only there were fewer committees or fewer lobbyists. ''You cannot get farm savings out of the farm committees,'' said Richard G. Darman, the budget director. Almost all the changes in the current budget plan would have been impossible to enact through the normal process of review by committees, he said.
Few would argue that the cumbersome budget process does much to stiffen the spine of individual lawmakers. But a larger truth has been at work, too. In the early 1980's, Republicans, from the White House, and Democrats, from their base on Capitol Hill, fought each other to a political standoff.
President Ronald Reagan said cut taxes and spend more on the military. Democrats argued that the outcome of such a policy would be cuts in social security and other benefits. Each side won its round. What was left was a political system that could neither raise taxes nor cut programs.
''I think this is a natural, almost inevitable adaptation to an extended period of divided government,'' said Mr. Mann of the Brookings Institution, adding, ''The recourse to a more centralized, more hierarchical, more leadership-oriented process is truly remarkable.''
 
A Round of Self-Examination
In the short run, which certainly includes the 34 days between now and election day, the budget compromise blurs partisan distinctions, said David Dreher, a spokesman for Mr. Gephardt. But in the long run, he suggested it may help sharpen them. ''We have insured in the Democratic Party and insured in the Republican Party fierce internal debate over what the party stands for and the positions over time will sharpen,'' Mr. Dreher said.
Democrats will focus even more on the fairness of the tax system, he argued, while Republicans will press even harder for growth producing tax incentives.
''We will be fighting this battle,'' Mr. Dreher said, ''as soon as George Bush submits his budget for 1992.''

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET AGREEMENT;
Focus on the Tax Package: Who Will Pay How Much?

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 3

 BODY:
Since the President and Congressional leaders proposed a deficit-reduction package on Sunday night, a central political issue has been how the burden of proposed new taxes would fall on rich, poor and middle-income taxpayers.
New estimates by the staff of the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation show that under the agreement, taxes would rise relatively more for people with income under $10,000 a year than for others. For people with incomes of $20,000 to $50,000 a year, the increases would be greater than for people with annual income exceeding $100,000, the calculations released Tuesday evening show.
Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin, said the changes ''will make our tax system more unfair.'' He complained that the agreement ''pounds middle-income taxpayers, but hardly lays a glove on the super-rich with incomes of $200,000 and above.'' 
 
A Regressive Tax
Mr. Obey and other liberal Democrats said the package was regressive because it depended heavily on excise taxes, on gasoline, tobacco and alcoholic beverages, to raise additional revenue. A tax is said to be regressive when it takes a larger percentage of the income of people who make less money.
Many conservative Republicans dislike the tax package for other reasons. They say the proposed tax increases will stifle economic growth and push the economy into a recession.
Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, said today that the Treasury had not completed its estimates of the effects of the budget agreement on taxpayers at different income levels. He said the Treasury had some disputes with the joint tax panel over the methods to be used in making the calculations. The burden on upper-income taxpayers would increase over the five-year life of the deficit-reduction package, he said.
The regressive nature of the tax changes would be moderated by a separate proposal, pending in Congress, to increase the existing tax credit for low-income families with children. The budget agreement would increase the Earned Income Tax Credit for such families. Comprehensive child-care legislation passed in different forms by the two houses of Congress would further increase and expand the credit.
 
Combined Effects
Earlier analyses by the joint tax panel, including one reported in The New York Times on Tuesday, calculated the combined effect of the larger increase in the tax credit and the tax provisions of the budget compromise.
Some version of the budget agreement is almost certain to become law. But there is no guarantee that Congress will finally pass the child-care legislation; President Bush dislikes the House and Senate bills, and Administration officials have repeatedly threatened a veto.
The impact on households with incomes below $20,000 is very different depending on whether the budget pact proposals are considered alone or in combination with a possible large increase in the earned-income credit. Taken by itself, the proposed budget pact would increase the Federal tax burden on those with incomes of $20,000 or less. But when higher earned-income credit is included, the combined effect would mean a reduction of overall Federal taxes on that income group.
For its part, the House Ways and Means Committee, with assistance from the Congressional Budget Office, has tried to measure the impact of a slightly different set of assumptions. The panel examined the effects of the tax changes in the budget agreement with the cutbacks in Federal benefit programs recommended by the negotiators. For the poorest fifth of families, after-tax income, which averages $7,316 a year, would decline 2 percent, the committee staff said. For the most affluent fifth, after-tax income, which averages $81,934 a year, would decline by nine-tenths of 1 percent, the staff estimated.
 
Economic Assumptions
Revenue estimates are sometimes very accurate. But they depend on assumptions about the economy and the behavior of taxpayers, which is not easy to predict.
For example, the latest estimates assume that increased tobacco taxes will lead to some reduction in cigarette sales. But the estimates do not try to take account of changes in interest rates, inflation and gross national product that would result from the 35 tax proposals.
''Economic changes tend to dwarf tax changes,'' said C. Eugene Steuerle, former Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for tax analysis. Mr. Steuerle, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said the latest revenue estimates were not surprising because ''excise taxes apply to the broad spectrum of income classes and tend to be regressive.''
But, he said, the agreement, could have ''long-run benefits for the economy, which will help all income classes.'' If Federal budget deficits are not reduced now, he said, people ''would face even larger tax increases and expenditure cuts in the future.''
 
Hard to Estimate
James W. Wetzler, Commissioner of Taxation and Finance in New York State, said estimates of excise tax collections tended to be reliable because the Government had a large amount of data and years of experience with levies on gasoline, tobacco and alcoholic beverages. But, he said, the Government has much less experience with tax provisions intended to stimulate economic growth.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET AGREEMENT;
BUDGET PLAN FAILS FIRST HOUSE TEST BY 254-179 MARGIN

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Friday, Oct. 5

 BODY:
In a stunning defeat for President Bush and the Democratic leadership in Congress, the budget compromise they announced in the Rose Garden last weekend failed its first test early today in the House of Representatives.
The 254-to-179 vote in the House was not conclusive, and many more budget votes are likely before Congress adjourns later this month to prepare for the midterm election.
But the defeat this morning will send the budget negotiators back to the drafting board, and it is not clear how they will proceed.
 
Republicans Defect
Dozens of Democrats who would have voted for the measure if their votes had been needed withheld voting until the last minute and many others switched to be aagainst the measure when it became clear that a majority of Republicans were voting against the President.
The budget deal was brought down by an unusual coalition of conservative Republicans and liberal Democrats. 
Representative William H. Gray 3d of Pennsylvania, the House Democratic whip, said he expected the President and Congressional leaders to talk later today about how to proceed.
The vote this morning was in doubt until close to the end. Lawmakers clustered around a computer screen that shows the party breakdowns of votes as they are cast.
In the final tally, 149 Democrats and 105 Republicans voted against the measure; 108 Democrats and 71 Republicans voted for it.
 
Deadline on Friday
Mr. Gray, who was in charge of rounding up Democratic votes, said a majority of Democrats would have voted for the measure if a majority of Republicans had done so.
At midnight Friday, the Government's authority to spend money is to expire and the rules of the budget law setting across-the-board spending cuts are to go into effect. President Bush has promised to block any extension of the deadline if Congress does not pass the budget resolution, the first step in the overall budget process.
The Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, said he expected those deadlines would be extended.
The vote was on what is called a budget resolution, a measure setting the outlines for how much money the Government will collect and spend in the 1991 fiscal year.
 
'World Is Watching'
Representative Leon E. Panetta, Democrat of California, said the vote was ''the essential first step in the budget process.'' That statement was backed up by Representative E. Thomas Coleman, a Missouri Republican, who presented the case that the legions of lobbyists for the Bush Administration had been making all week.
''The world is watching, and this is truly a test of the President's leadership,'' Mr. Coleman declared. ''If we were in a parliamentary system, it would be a vote of no confidence. How would that be interpreted around the world?''
But the budget deal came under immediate attack from both conservatives and liberals.
''It is sheer folly,'' said Representative Bud Shuster, Republican of Pennsylvania, ''for us to impose on the American people a $134 billion tax increase when we're on the brink of recession.''
But Representative Barbara Boxer, a California Democrat, contended that the Bush Administration was determined to ''protect the rich'' from tax increases, to ''cut the dickens out of Medicare'' and to ''keep the military budget high.''
''The President's men succeeded on all three counts,'' she declared.
The budget compromise is supposed to reduce the budget deficit by $40 billion this year and by $500 billion over five years through a series of spending cuts and tax increases.
 
Pulling Out the Stops
The stakes today were so high that the President and the Congressional leaders pulled out all the stops to win votes. And scores of lawmakers, facing an uproar from their constituents over unpopular measures like a higher gasoline tax and deep cuts in the Medicare program, were uneasy and undecided about how to vote until the last moment.
Democrats met throughout the day in the office of the Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, tallying their commitments. Republicans had similar meetings in the office of the minority leader, Robert H. Michel of Illinois.
Mr. Foley and Mr. Panetta spent the day trying to reassure colleagues that the compromise was not written in stone and that changes could be made before a final vote was taken.
But Republicans were wary about allowing changes to be written by House committees with a 3-to-2 majority of Democrats. Each Democratic vote won by pledging more flexibility in the process risked losing a Republican vote.
 
Anguish Was Apparent
Although the test votes are not the conclusive action on the budget package, the anguish of the lawmakers was apparent in almost every conversation in the Capitol.
Some were torn between loyalty to the President or their party leaders on the one hand and stiff opposition from important constituents on the other. Others felt tension between their political philosophy, whether liberal or conservative, and their sense that deficit reduction was of paramount importance.
After talking with colleagues on the House floor, Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat, said, ''A lot of members are saying, 'This is the biggest vote I've had in my career.' ''
Opposition to the budget compromise came from several directions.
Some based their stance on ideology. Conservatives maintained that higher taxes would stifle the economy. Democrats contended that tax increases were concentrated too heavily on low- and middle-income Americans and that cuts in military spending were insufficient.
 
Concern for Constituents
Others fought the measure because they said they believed it would put their constituents at a disadvantage. New Englanders, for example, protested the 2-cents-a-gallon tax on home heating oil. Lawmakers from the farm belt objected to reductions in agriculture price supports.
Representative Raymond J. McGrath, a Republican from Nassau County in New York, said: ''I have eight hospitals in my district. This is a $25 million hit to the hospitals in my county.''
Finally, some opposition arose from the jurisdictional jealousy of committee chairmen who saw their influence drained by the decisions of the budget negotiators.
Representative Norman Y. Mineta, a California Democrat who heads the surface transportation subcommittee, contended that his panel would have little to do if revenue from the gasoline tax, previously earmarked for highway construction, was used instead for deficit reduction.
Nearly all of the Cabinet members and other top officials of the Bush Administration were involved in the heavy lobbying campaign, buttonholing lawmakers in the corridors of the Capitol or telephoning them one after another.
The Republicans also received a letter from Lee Atwater, the ailing chairman of the Republican National Committee. ''For the sake of your country and your party, I urge you to stand up for our President,'' he wrote.
 
Where Lobbyists Usually Go
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher spent the afternoon in the hallway just off the House floor where lobbyists for interest groups usually congregate. As Representatives came in for votes on a crime bill, Mr. Mosbacher tugged at sleeves and passed out sheets of paper on the budget compromise just like a lobbyist.
''The country and the whole world needs this to keep the economy going,'' he was overheard to tell a group of lawmakers.
At the White House, Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said that Mr. Bush was ''concerned'' about ''a myriad things,'' including developments in the Persian Gulf, arms control and German unification, but that ''the budget is the major focus.''
''George Bush likes having a lot of balls in the air,'' he said. ''It turned out this time to be big medicine balls.''
House Democrats caucused this morning, and lawmakers said it was clear that a majority would go against the leadership on the test vote unless they were promised that changes would be made before the substance of the deficit-reduction package was voted on. That vote was not scheduled until week after next.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET AGREEMENT;
Governors Say Budget Plan Shifts More Burdens to States

BYLINE: By MICHAEL deCOURCY HINDS

 BODY:
Already struggling with declining economies and a hardening resistance to new taxes, many state officials around the nation say the proposal to reduce the Federal deficit that was defeated early this morning would have only made matters worse by expanding a decadelong shift of Federal responsibilities to state and local governments.
What was new in the budget agreement, they said, was that the Government was not only forwarding more social service bills to state capitals, but by raising Federal excise taxes on gasoline, alcohol and cigarettes it was also trying to poach on the tax revenues that states have been using to pay their bills.
Views of the plan itself ranged between strong opposition and resigned acceptance. No enthusiastic supporters could be found in a random telephone survey of two dozen governors' offices, and most budget officials said they were still trying to assess the ultimate impact of the complex plan on state economies and budgets.
But then again, most said they were already trying to cope with severe budgetary troubles. 
''I am not smart enough to know if this package is good for the American people,'' said Gov. Buddy Roemer of Louisiana. ''But this is a major step in the transfer of Federal responsibilities to the states, and many governors, if they haven't already discovered it, will make that painful discovery in the next year or two.''
Governor Roemer, a Democrat, and officials in other states compared the budget agreement reached over the weekend by the Bush Administration and Congressional leaders to earlier landmarks of what has been labeled the New Federalism, including President Ronald Reagan's tax reforms and termination of Federal revenue sharing with the states and cities.
But Gov. John Waihee 3d of Hawaii, also a Democrat, said: ''I wouldn't dignify this with a name. This proposal isn't federalism; it's plain old double jeopardy where you get revenues taken away, taxes increased and services decreased.''
 
'Double Squeeze'
Christopher Zimmerman, the chief economist for the National Conference of State Legislatures, said the proposal would cost the states $7 billion over the next five years.
He said these costs would accompany the plan's creation of new burdens. For example, there is the requirement that more state and local government employees - and thus their employers, the state and local governments - pay Social Security taxes. The plan would also shift to the states some expenses for social services, including Medicaid.
At the same time, in what Mr. Zimmerman called a ''double squeeze,'' the proposed Federal tax increases on tobacco, gasoline, other petroleum products and alcohol would indirectly decrease state tax revenues by about $7.6 billion during the same period.
This projected loss is based on the economic principle that consumers would respond to higher consumer taxes by purchasing fewer goods, thus reducing the local revenues from the sales of these items.
And by increasing such taxes, the Government would make it much more difficult for the states to tap these again in the future. According to the Census Bureau, taxes on fuel, tobacco and alcohol make up 9 percent of the states' tax revenues.
 
Large Increase in State Taxes
''By my count, 80 percent of the revenues in the package are coming from state sources and will be injurious to state fiscal systems,'' Mr. Zimmerman said. His estimate of the total cost to the states, $14.6 billion over five years or about $3 billion a year, may not seem significant compared with the $376 billion that states collected in revenues last year.
But Mr. Zimmerman said, ''It's still a big chunk of change, compared to the amount of revenues a state can raise with any particular tax.'' This year, for example, 26 states raised taxes by a total of $10.3 billion in the largest single-year state tax increase ever recorded, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers.
The biggest concern state officials have with the budget proposal's tax package is that the proposed cuts in Medicare payments would force more and more elderly people with low incomes into Medicaid, the health care program for the indigent in which costs are shared by the states and the Federal Government.
States pay for 44 percent, and the Federal Government pays 56 percent. Mr. Zimmerman estimated that the tax package would increase the states' share by $1.8 billion over the next five years.
Medicaid costs have been soaring in recent years, up 18 percent last year alone, and this year it became the states' second-highest expense, displacing state spending on higher education, and coming right behind state spending on elementary and secondary education, according to the National Governors' Association.
 
Criticism From Democrats
Democratic opponents of the plan have been vocal.
Massachusetts Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, who has been struggling with a severely deteriorating budget situation for more than a year, said, ''In the 1980's, the New Federalism shifted spending to the states; in the 1990's, the newest federalism shifts the revenue structure too.''
Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia said the proposal would force him to cut ''a couple hundred million dollars'' from a $26 billion two-year budget that had already been reduced by $1.4 billion. ''If Congress and the White House could bring themselves to make the kind of cuts we did in Virginia, they would have reduced spending by $72 billion. Why do they postpone cuts?''
A Republican Governor, Stan Stephens of Montana, echoed many of the criticisms made by the Democratic governors. ''I would like to see Congress start talking about cutting the size and scope of government, as we governors have had to do, instead of talking about which taxes they feel comfortable raising,'' he said.
Even a co-author of the budget agreement, Representative Bill Frenzel, a Republican from Minnesota, had little enthusiasm for the package, even though he defended it.
''I was not a great proponent of adding to the excise taxes, although that is the way Congress went, so I am supporting it,'' he said.
''I think my own state, Minnesota, does not like the additional taxes, but other than the people who protest certain taxes or certain spending cuts, most of the rest of the people are saying, 'Maybe it's not a great idea, but we have to do something about the Federal deficit.' ''
 
Willingness to Cope
Some governors took a neutral stand. Governor Roemer said Louisiana would be able to manage, however unwillingly, the added burden because the recent increase in oil prices had bolstered the state's economy.
Gov. Bob Miller of Nevada, another Democrat, said, ''I appreciate the fact that the Federal Government is between a rock and a hard place and something has to be done.''
Richard D. Kready, the chief of staff for Kansas' Republican Governor, Mike Hayden, said his boss supported the President.
''With Bob Dole being the Republican leader in the Senate and also from the state of Kansas, we hope that our interests are already being very well represented,'' Mr. Hayden said. ''We are certainly interested in seeing the deficit being addressed.''
Some governors said through spokesmen that they would not comment until they had thoroughly reviewed the tax proposal, and a dozen other governors could not be reached for comment.
 
Differing Impacts Seen
But budget directors of several states, including Illinois and Florida, had relatively positive views of the proposal, an indication that its components will have different impacts on nearly every state.
David L. Wood, the acting budget director for Illinois, said: ''The Federal proposal is a very small increase in the grand scheme of things, so it would have only moderate impact.''
Florida's budget director, Patricia A. Woodworth, said, ''We beat the Feds to the punch: we raised our excise taxes already.'' She said the state raised a variety of taxes by a total of $1.4 billion earlier this year and expected to adopt cuts of $500 million more out of the $11.4 billion budget for the current fiscal year.
''We're involved in our own budget crisis here, so we understand what it's like to make ends meet,'' Ms. Woodworth said.
The proposed limitation on income tax deductions would also make it more difficult for state and local governments to raise taxes, said Mr. Zimmerman.
 
'Taxes on Taxes'
Under the proposal, people with adjusted gross incomes of more than $100,000 would would have their total itemized deductions reduced by 3 percent of the amount over $100,000. A couple with $110,000 income, for example, would have the value of their itemized deductions reduced by $300 and would have to pay about $84 more, including a Federal tax of $28 on the taxes they already paid to state and local governments.
Over the next five years, the budget negotiators say, this change would generate $18 billion, including, Mr. Zimmerman said, about $6 billion in taxes that would be charged on the taxes paid to state and local governments. ''Taxpayers would be paying taxes on taxes if they can't deduct state and local taxes,'' he said. ''And that will make it very hard for state and local governments to raise taxes they need.''
Experts at the National Association of Budget Officers in Washington say the Federal budget-reduction package comes at a time when few states can afford any more financial burdens.
 
'Source of Added Pressure'
''It would clearly be a source of added pressure'' on faltering state budgets around the nation, said Marcia A. Howard, the association's research director. ''In the last fiscal year, which ended July 1, most states had to cut their budgets, borrow from internal funds, change paydays or do other budgeting gimmicks to allow them to finish the year in a break-even situation,'' she said.
''Over 30 states plan to spend more than they expect to collect in tax revenues, and their assumptions are based on no recession,'' she added. ''If we are already in a recession or if we slip into one, their budgets will be in much worse shape than projected, and the states may not have enough reserves to see them through a deteriorating economy.''
She said that New England states were in the worst shape and that Far Western states, with the exception of California, were in the best shape.
What irks the governors the most about the shifting burden is that their states have to pick up more of the cost of social services, but have almost no say creating or managing the programs.
''I speak for 49 other governors on this,'' said Governor Roemer. ''It might be that the government closest to the people works best, and that the New Federalism, the shifting to the states of more responsibilities, is the best thing. But the price tag, the purpose, the goals, the methodology all need to be discussed first. I get the sneaking suspicion that Washington wants to keep the bureaucracy and have somebody else pay for it.''

HEADLINE: Republican Quits Louisiana Race In Effort to Defeat Ex-Klansman

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Oct. 4

 BODY:
The Republican nominee for the United States Senate in Louisiana pulled out of a primary election today as part of an extraordinary Republican effort to promote the victory of the Democratic incumbent, Senator J. Bennett Johnston Jr., over State Representative David Duke, a former Ku Klux Klan leader.
The Republican candidate, Ben Bagert, who had been trailing badly in the polls, said today that he was dropping out of the Senate election set for Saturday. That sets up what is essentially a two-man race between Mr. Johnston and Mr. Duke, a Republican who is running under Louisiana's unusual election laws without the party's backing.
The move is aimed at avoiding a runoff election on Nov. 6, which would be needed if no candidate receives 50 percent of the vote on Saturday. 
Poll figures have not varied greatly during the race, with Mr. Johnston at about 50 percent, Mr. Duke about 30 percent, and Mr. Bagert struggling to become a factor. There are also two political unknowns on the ballot.
Republican officials said that with the election imminent and Mr. Bagert's chances minimal, it became clear that the only effect he could have by remaining in the race would be to force a runoff between Mr. Johnston and Mr. Duke. Mr. Duke was never given much chance of winning, but it was thought he could advance his far-right agenda through the publicity he would receive if he was able to force a runoff.
Moreover, Republicans feared that a runoff campaign lasting up to Election Day, with Mr. Duke as the party's de facto nominee, would prove a serious liability to the party nationally. Eight Republican senators have made what appears to be an unprecedented appeal by publicly calling for the election of the Democrat.
''The way to look at it is that we are doing our best to insure the defeat of extremism and bigotry,'' said Charles Black, spokesman for the Republican National Committee, who said Republican officials had discussed the withdrawal with Mr. Bagert but had not asked for it. ''We'll oppose David Duke no matter who's running against him.''
The withdrawal is likely to mean that Mr. Johnston will easily win re-election on Saturday, Louisiana observers say. Under Louisiana law, Mr. Bagert's name will remain on the ballot, but votes for him will not count.
 
'Bad News' for Duke
''It's very bad news for David Duke and very good news for Bennett Johnston,'' said Edward Renwick, director of the Loyola University Institute of Politics in New Orleans. ''It will be very difficult for Duke to get much more than 40 percent of the vote.''
But in a volatile election year marked by widespread dissatisfaction with the status quo, Mr. Duke's supporters are hoping the move to re-elect Mr. Bennett, a three-term incumbent from Shreveport, could boomerang.
''The fix is on, and people won't buy it,'' said Mark Ellis, a spokesman for Mr. Duke. ''People are really fed up with the political establishment and the establishment media. With the establishment aligning itself against David Duke, they send a lot of voters our way.''
Joe Walker, a New Orleans poll taker and political analyst, said a Duke victory was not likely. He said Mr. Bagert's vote was largely a mainstream Republican vote that would be likely to follow the instincts of the national party. He said Mr. Johnston would probably have polled 50 percent of the vote even with Mr. Bagert in the race.
''My sense was that Bagert's vote is also an anti-Duke vote,'' Mr. Walker said. ''Bagert has been very stridently anti-Duke from the beginning. The surveys I've seen showed that Bagert's vote was about 4 to 1 for Johnston as the second choice. No one knows what kind of psychological mass psychosis could take over as Duke presumes, but it would not follow any historic evidence or pattern.''
 
Disappointment for Republicans
Mr. Johnston told The Associated Press he hoped Mr. Bagert's withdrawal would increase his chances of victory without a runoff: ''It's been a two-man race for some time, and this makes it very clear,'' he said. ''I'm very much hoping that the Bagert vote, which has been about eight percent, would come to me.''
The most recent poll, released Wednesday by Mason-Dixion Opinion Research, showed Mr. Johnston with 53 percent, Mr. Duke with 26 percent and Mr. Bagert with 8 percent. The poll of 825 registered voters had a margin of sampling error of 3.5 percentage points.
Mr. Bagert's withdrawal culminates what has been a disappointing drive for the Republicans. Mr. Johnston was viewed as one of the more vulnerable Democratic incumbents a year ago in the face of Louisiana's economic problems and a voting record Republicans deemed overly liberal.
But the whole tenor of the campaign changed when Mr. Duke decided to continue his candidacy after the Republicans nominated Mr. Bagert, a State Senator from New Orleans Mr. Duke elbowed Mr. Bagert out of the picture almost from the start, and coverage of the race has been dominated by Mr. Duke's involvment with white supremacist groups, his appeals to white resentment over affirmative-action programs, even his history of cosmetic surgery.
Today Mr. Bagert said: ''As my campaign finally began to get on track in the last couple of weeks, it became more and more apparent, that instead of forcing a runoff between myself and Bennett Johnston, I might very well be forcing a runoff between somebody else and Bennett Johnston.''
He said he would ''reluctantly'' vote for Mr. Johnston.
With Mr. Bagert's candidacy apparently moribund, Republicans have taken extraordinary steps to avoid a runoff between Mr. Johnston and Mr. Duke. Eight Republican Senators backed Mr. Johnston this week. Five of them signed an open letter to Louisiana voters saying that Mr. Duke ''has no place in our party or in this body.''
The letter was signed by Republican Senators Rudy Boschwitz of Minnesota, John C. Danforth of Missouri, Ted Stevens of Alaska, Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire and William S. Cohen of Maine. Three Republican senators, Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska, Dave Durenberger of Minnesota and Nancy Landon Kassenbaum of Kansas, have also voiced support for it.
''All of us would be embarassed and mortified to have to serve in the United States Senate with David Duke masquerading as a Republican,'' Mr. Danforth said at a news conference in Washington this week.

HEADLINE: Surveys Proliferate, but Answers Dwindle

BYLINE: By RANDALL ROTHENBERG

 BODY:
Market researchers are discovering that if you ask a simple question these days, you might not get any answer at all.
Deluged by a growing number of telephone solicitations and increasingly jealous of their time, more and more Americans are refusing to participate in market-research surveys. Miami, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Los Angeles have the least cooperative residents, interviewers have found, and more than a third of all Americans contacted routinely shut the door or hang up the phone on their questions.
That leaves researchers confronting a new question: Is the ever-shrinking segment of consumers who will talk to them really representative of the rest of the population?
 
Small, Random Samples
Techniques forged by social scientists earlier this century have been refined by statisticians and computer modelers to the point that researchers need survey only a small, random sample of people to project their attitudes onto the entire population.
Today, companies use information from the $2.5 billion market-research industry to determine everything from whether car advertising will emphasize safety or comfort to whether to include more comedies or dramas on the fall television schedule. 
But if the samples are not representative, the research could point companies in the wrong direction.
''Random samples are becoming impossible to obtain,'' said Don E. Schultz, a professor of advertising at Northwestern University's Medill School of Journalism. ''With cooperation rates dropping like a rock, you may have large numbers of people who hold violently different views from those who are willing to talk.''
People who conduct large public opinion polls say they can correct their samples to reflect the people who will not participate. But these methods are often too expensive and time-consuming for many market-research surveys, especially at a time many companies are finding their marketing budgets squeezed.
''The problems of collecting data and the fragility of that data is something that's come progressively upon us,'' said Leo Bogart, the longtime executive vice president at the Newspaper Advertising Bureau, who retired last year. ''It's part of the disintegration of the core values that make up the society, the unwillingness to accept the good will of strangers and the general wariness people have.''
 
An Untimely Request
One newly reticent American is Lynne D. Oliva, a 33-year-old mother of two in Encino, Calif., who said she recently turned down a telephone request to interview her about where she shops, because ''it was 7 o'clock, I was putting the kids to bed and it was zoo time around here, which is when these people call.''
''I don't like to spend time talking to these people,'' Mrs. Oliva said.
A study by Walker Research, a St. Louis company that tracks trends in the market-research industry, found in 1988 that 34 percent of all adults contacted said they had refused an interview request during the previous year, up from 15 percent in the company's 1982 survey. Members of the Council of American Survey Research Organizations, an industry association, reported that 38 percent of consumers had turned down their interviewers in 1988.
The council found the overall refusal rate unchanged from 1985 but markedly higher for some forms of research and in some areas of the country. Thirty-six percent of all Americans contacted closed their doors on door-to-door interviewers in 1988, up from 29 percent in 1985. In the Northeast, 49 percent of consumers contacted just said no to questions about their possessions, attitudes and life styles, a rise of eight percentage points since 1985.
 
Resistance to the Census
The lack of participation was also felt this year by the Census Bureau, whose findings determine each state's representation in Congress and some amounts of Federal aid to states and cities. In 1980, three-quarters of all households initially mailed back their census forms, said John J. Connolly, the assistant to Barbara Everitt Bryan, the director of the Census. This year, the bureau's experts expected 70 percent to do so, but so far, only 63 percent have.
One business already subject to questions because of the rising research refusal rate is the Nielsen television rating system. The ratings are used by the television networks as a measure of which shows viewers like and by consumer-products companies to place more than $12 billion worth of advertising annually.
In the first three months of this year, Nielsen reported an unexpectedly sharp drop from the year before in the number of households watching television. In daytime last February, for example, about 2.2 million people of the more than 27 million who had watched the year before turned off their sets - a drop of 8 percent.
 
Complaints About Nielsen
The networks blame not the quality of their programs but the way the A. C. Nielsen Company conducted its research. Among other things, they pointed to a study done for a broadcast industry group, the Committee on Nationwide Television Audience Measurement, which showed that in June 1989 only 47 percent of the households Nielsen had chosen for its sample agreed to take its ''people meter,'' forcing the company to go to alternate homes. Eleven years earlier, 68 percent of Nielsen's first-choice homes took its meters.
The study attributed the steady decline to ''an increasing societal tendency to refuse participation in surveys.''
Robert Niles, the head of research at NBC, spoke for many network executives when he said, ''We don't know whether the people who turned down the people meter are like those who agreed to take it.''
John Dimling, an executive vice president of Nielsen Media Research in New York, responded that several independent studies of television viewership have shown that people who refuse the company's meters are similar to those who take it.
 
Ways of Compensating
The large organizations that conduct national public opinion polls say they are less affected than many market-research companies about the rising survey refusal rate.
''We feel we can compensate for the amount of non-response we get,'' said Diane Colasanto, a partner in Princeton Survey Research Associates, a New Jersey company that does opinion polls for the Times Mirror Company, the Los Angeles-based media concern.
''We always look at how the characteristics of the sample we interview differ from the population using Census Bureau information,'' she said. ''We know there's some systematic bias. We know that people with lower educational levels tend not to participate in surveys, so we have to give greater weight to them in our analysis. We know some people, like young men, are hard to find at home. But we feel the kinds of techniques we use to compensate for that are reasonable and don't give a biased overall result.''
A study this year by members of The New York Times's news surveys department indicated that people who initially refused to talk to interviewers showed ''no consistent patterns of attitudinal difference'' from people who did cooperate, although some questions in some surveys did elicit different responses from the two groups.
Michael Kagay, the news surveys editor of The Times, said the newspaper's confidence in its surveys remained high.
''Public opinion polls depend on the good will and cooperation of the American people, and we're constantly monitoring that and taking steps to preserve it or compensate for it,'' he said.
 
'Fearful of Self-Selection'
These studies do not mollify many market researchers, who fear that as the population of research refuseniks grows, the ability to compare them to the rest of the population is disappearing.
''Everyone is fearful of self-selection and worried that the generalizations you make are based on cooperators only,'' said Verne B. Churchill, the chairman and chief executive of Market Facts, one of the nation's largest designers of custom market-research surveys.
He said that rising refusal rates on telephone surveys had moved his company to depend more on mail surveys using large, fixed groups of people. ''We get a high completion rate because they know we're legitimate questioners and we're not out to sell anything,'' Mr. Churchill said. ''But there's still fear that this panel is different from the rest of the population.''
In some cases, companies are offering gifts or discounts on products to persuade people to participate in surveys, which also contributes to the fear that a sample may be biased.
 
'Too Much Information'
Even mail surveys have trouble getting people to respond. Sandi Lowich, an unemployed newspaper editor in Oshkosh, Wis., said she had recently received a solicitation from a research company to participate in a survey by mail, but she threw out the questionnaire.
''I like to do that sort of thing, but you had to give too much information about your household,'' said Ms. Lowich, who is 39. ''I wasn't sure how it was going to be used, and I didn't know who these people were, and I wasn't sure they'd keep it confidential.''
While privacy is a concern for many people, the survey by Walker Research said the declining cooperation rate could be traced to three factors: inconvenience, telemarketing and selling under the guise of market research, a technique known in the industry, because of its acronym, as ''sugging.''
In 1982, 15 percent of the people in the Walker survey said they had been exposed to a sales pitch disguised as a survey. By 1988, 22 percent had been ''sugged.''
 
A Mother's Complaint
''They say they're doing market research, but they're really trying to sell you water treatments,'' said Mary Bizal, a 31-year-old mother in Sterling, Va., who says that happened to her three times in the last two years.
Some marketing experts, like Professor Schultz at Northwestern, say information about people's actual purchasing behavior, gleaned from universal product code scanners increasingly found in stores, will eventually replace projections based on randomly selected population samples.
But that development, most say, will be years in the future, if it comes at all, and could still be upset by consumers' reluctance about having their privacy invaded.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Says He Is Considering Laying Off 15,000 City Workers

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
In a stark indication of New York City's worsening fiscal condition, Mayor David N. Dinkins said yesterday that he was considering the possible layoff of at least 15,000 city workers and cuts in services to save $800 million and help close growing budget gaps in the current and next fiscal years.
In addition, the Mayor, as expected, announced an immediate partial hiring freeze and a ban on most promotions and all merit raises to save an additional $115 million over the rest of this fiscal year, which ends in June, and the next one.
The Mayor's announcements - just two days after he proposed hiring thousands of new police officers and other workers to expand the justice system - came in response to city budget officials' estimates this week that tax-collection revenues were falling below expectations at an annual rate of about $150 million. At the same time, costs have risen at unanticipated rates. 
 
First Layoffs Since Mid-1970's
The 15,000 layoffs, which were proposed by the city's Budget Director, Philip R. Michael, would represent about 5 percent of the city's more than 330,000 workers. They would be the first layoffs since the city's fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's, which cost more than 25,000 jobs.
Mr. Michael said that the layoffs alone could save more than $400 million if they began right away and that he could not yet detail the other cost-cutting moves.
Mr. Dinkins made it clear that he had not yet accepted the recommendation and said it was too early to say where, when or how layoffs could come.
The Mayor's moves came near the end of a tumultuous week at City Hall, in which he announced a tentative 5.5 percent raise for teachers - to be paid with previously budgeted money and a mix of other uncertain sources - and a four-year $1.8 billion anti-crime plan that called for a range of proposed new taxes dedicated to financing it.
Together, such news put mounting pressure on the Mayor from the fiscal monitoring agencies that are a legacy of the crisis of the mid-1970's to take decisive action to close an overall budget gap for the next fiscal year that he now estimates at more than $1.4 billion, or $500 million more than expected when the current budget was adopted in June. ''This is not at all pleasant, needless to say,'' Mr. Dinkins said. ''But fiscal stability is essential.''
 
'Analyzing All That'
Asked if layoffs might be avoided, he replied: ''Perhaps, but we don't yet know. We're analyzing all that now.''
Mr. Michael, while noting that he was still studying options in preparation for a final program to be included in the city's scheduled quarterly modification to its financial plan on Nov. 1, said, ''I project that a problem that large cannot be dealt with without layoffs.''
Inevitably, there was speculation that the Mayor's announcements were intended to put pressure on unions that have not yet settled new contracts, especially since the teachers' contract agreement was so widely criticized by fiscal monitors. In fact, labor leaders, most of whom were major supporters of Mr. Dinkins's candidacy last year, expressed outrage at the news, saying they had not been consulted in advance.
But other politicians said the Mayor's estimates were realistic, or even conservative.
''I think it's unfortunate, but I think it's reasonable,'' Herbert E. Berman, the City Council Finance Committee chairman, said of the layoff proposal.
 
Estimate by Holtzman
City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman said her estimates showed the budget gap for next year could amount to $2.6 billion, nearly twice the Mayor's estimate. She also said that even if all the proposed new taxes for the Mayor's anti-crime program are passed and if excess pension funds can be contributed to the teachers' pay increase, the city could face a budget gap of $700 million in the current fiscal year.
Mr. Michael said Ms. Holtzman's figures appeared to depend on the ''worst possible scenario.'' He said he could not estimate how great the total gap for the rest of this year could be, or how increased costs would add to the estimated $150 million revenue shortfall.
He said most of the falloff in tax receipts had come in the corporate profits tax, unincorporated busisness tax and certain property-related taxes, some of which were affected by the Persian Gulf crisis, which also drove up prices for fuel used by the city.
On the other hand, Mr. Michael said, taxes driven by inflation, like the sales and personal income taxes, appeared to be holding on par with expectations. He said he was not yet prepared to elaborate on any of the categories.
Felix G. Rohatyn, the head of the Municipal Assistance Corporation and an architect of the city's recovery from the fiscal crisis in the 1970's, said the announcement showed ''that the city is in worse condition than at least seemed to be the case 30 days ago.''
Mr. Rohatyn, a harsh critic of the teachers' pay settlement, said Mr. Michael's recommendation meant ''that the level of wage increases being proposed here is going to be paid for with very large layoffs.''
Mr. Michael and other officials were not prepared to say which agencies the hiring freeze, aimed at eliminating about 2,800 of 8,600 planned new jobs, would affect, or to what degree. But they said it would exempt jobs that generate revenues or save money or handle functions required by law or considered crucial. The hiring proposed in the anti-crime plan would be exempt, for the moment, though it is predicated on a range of new taxes that face an uphill fight for approval.
Mr. Michael and Mr. Dinkins both said it was too early to speculate on whether closing the budget gaps would require even more new taxes than those proposed to finance the anti-crime package, speaking instead of hopes for more state and Federal aid. But such taxes are clearly a possibility. Likely to Be Affected The layoffs alone would generate about $390 million annually, and more than that if instituted over this and the next fiscal year. Mr. Michael said they would undoubtedly fall heavily on areas traditionally trimmed in budget cuts, like parks, sanitation, transportation, libraries and cultural groups, but could extend to other agencies, too.
Although some fiscal experts had been predicting for weeks that tax receipts were dropping below expectations, city officials apparently only just learned more details. On Tuesday, the City Finance Commissioner, Carol O'Cleireacain, said receipts were not below target, while on Wednesday Mr. Michael said they were.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Gorbachev Aide Meets Iraqi On Soviets Trapped in Gulf

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A Soviet envoy carried a message from President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to Baghdad and Japan's Prime Minister met with Iraq's No. 2 leader yesterday in new peace efforts in the Persian Gulf.
The Soviet official, Yevgeny M. Primakov, arrived in Baghdad and met with Iraq's Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz. No details were released, but Soviet officials said beforehand that Mr. Primakov's primary purpose would be to seek the release of about 5,000 Soviet citizens stranded in Iraq. 
Mr. Primakov, a member of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's Presidential Council, is one of the few senior officials from any country that has not aligned itself with Iraq to have visited Baghdad since the invasion of Kuwait.
But in the Jordanian capital, Amman, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu of Japan met with the Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister, Taha Yassin Ramadan. Mr. Ramadan, considered No. 2 to President Saddam Hussein, rejected a negotiated settlement to the crisis as long as foreign troops remain on Arab soil, Baghdad's official press agency reported.
 
Mitterrand Arrives in Jidda
Shigeo Takenaka, Mr. Kaifu's spokesman, said the Japanese leader insisted on Iraq's withdrawal from Kuwait first. Meeting later with King Hussein of Jordan, Mr. Kaifu offered $250 million in development loans to Jordan, which has been hard-hit by the embargo of Iraq.
President Francois Mitterrand of France, whom Saddam has tried to engage in separate peace talks, is also touring the region. He arrived in Saudi Arabia yesterday and met with King Fahd in the Saudi port of Jidda.
Also arriving in Saudi Arabia were three Britons and two Frenchmen who were rescued by the Saudi Coast Guard after they escaped from Iraq in a 10-foot boat, and spent 25 hours - much of the time being tossed in 10-foot swells - before being rescued Wednesday, they told reporters.
''It's a trip I wouldn't like to do again, but it was well worth it now that I am here,'' one of the escapees, Mike Teesdale, 40 years old, told a news conference in the Saudi border town of Khafji. ''My fear was of Iraq, not of the trip.'' #2,200 Westerners Held The escapees said they had taken the 10-foot boat through the marshes of southern Iraq, into the Shatt al Arab and then the gulf. Mr. Teesdale said the men had only a compass to guide them and got lost several times.
The Britons said that they had been working on an oil installation near the Iraqi port of Basra and that the two Frenchmen were barge masters.
Iraq is holding about 2,200 Westerners hostage in Kuwait and Iraq, some at strategic installations to discourage attack by the United States-led military forces that began massing in the region after Iraq seized Kuwait.
The United States now has about 170,000 military personnel in Saudi Arabia and on ships in the area, making up most of the international force estimated at 200,000 members. The Pentagon says Iraq has massed 460,000 troops in Kuwait since the invasion.
 
U.S. Warship Leaves Gulf
The American total includes the crew of the aircraft carrier Independence, which sailed out of the Persian Gulf yesterday after spending two days in its relatively confined and shallow waters.
A Pentagon spokesman, Pete Williams, said the aircraft carrier had successfully completed its mission, which was ''to demonstrate to our friends and allies in the region that it is possible to put a carrier in the gulf and carry out operations.''
No American aircraft carrier had entered the Persian Gulf since 1974.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF: DOUBTS ON SANCTIONS;
Analysts and Arab Supporters Believe Military Action Will Be Used in Gulf

BYLINE: By JUDITH MILLER

 BODY:
While President Bush's remarks at the United Nations on Monday emphasized that the United States would welcome a diplomatic solution to the confrontation in the Persian Gulf, Administration analysts and Arab supporters of American policy continue to believe that a diplomatic solution to the crisis is unlikely.
''We think that military action will ultimately be essential,'' said a senior Arab diplomat visiting New York.
In a meeting in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, yesterday with President Francois Mitterrand, King Fahd of Saudi Arabia reiterated his view that the economic sanctions would fail to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait, a French official told reporters.
''It must be carried through to the finish, but unfortunately, Saddam Hussein does not seem to be listening,'' Hubert Vedrine, the French spokesman, quoted the Saudi King as saying. Summarizing Saudi sentiment, Mr. Vedrine said the embargo was ''all very well, but when do we strike?'' 
Meanwhile, a senior Administration official said that the Administration was compiling lists of additional possible resolutions for Security Council approval to pressure and isolate Iraq further, even though the United States believes that Article 51 of the United Nations charter already authorizes it to take action to counter Iraqi aggression.
He declined to state when or whether such resolutions would be offered, but possibilities include actions contemplated under Article 41 of the United Nations charter, such as tightening sanctions by barring mail, radio and television broadcasts, faxes and other forms of telecommunications. Article 41 also permits the Security Council to authorize the severance of diplomatic relations, but, the Administration official said, this was not under consideration at this time.
 
Hysteria Deflected
''We're willing to do everything to persuade him to withdraw short of using military force,'' a senior official said. ''But at the end of the road is military action, and we hope that he remembers that.''
Administration officials eagerly underscored the point this week that President Bush's speech to the United Nations was not a departure from existing policy. But Administration and foreign analysts alike argue that it has served several useful functions.
First, it deflected a minor bout of diplomatic and journalistic hysteria that war might be imminent, which was triggered by White House reaction on Friday to President Bush's meeting with Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the Emir of Kuwait.
Reacting to the Emir's stomach-churning account of atrocities taking place in Kuwait under Iraqi occupation, Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser, told reporters that such events might shorten the time that the Administration was willing to wait for the economic sanctions against Iraq force its withdrawal from the sheikdom. Mr. Scowcroft also said that given what appeared to be Iraq's systematic effort to pillage and destroy Kuwait, the United States might seek a United Nations resolution that would authorize the use of military force.
Mr. Scowcroft's comments led Kuwaitis and other Arab diplomats to believe, erroneously, Administration offficial assert, that the Administration was quickly losing patience with its economic sanctions strategy and leaning closer toward using military force.
 
Use of the Palestinians
''I think Brent was reacting emotionally and viscerally to what he heard,'' said a senior Administration official. ''But neither his comments nor the speech were intended as a departure from our balanced policy towards the gulf.''
The speech has also helped deprive Saddam Hussein of two powerful arguments that have had resonance in Arab countries. By suggesting that after Iraq withdraws from Kuwait the Administration would emphasize the diplomatic resolution of other conflicts, including the Arab-Israeli dispute, President Bush signaled to an Arab audience that the United States was not indifferent to the plight of the Palestinians and that Saddam Hussein was not the only leader ostensibly committed to seeking justice for them.
''I think it has become clearer now that Saddam's use of the Palestinians is tactical,'' said one senior Administration official, ''that his use of the Palestinian cause has served only to distract attention from what he has done in Kuwait.''
A senior Arab diplomat echoed this sentiment. ''Why should Saddam be the only Arab champion of the Palestinians?'' he said. ''It's up not only to the Administration, but to Arab leaders to take this issue away from him.''
The diplomat added that when the Arab League foreign ministers met on Wednesday at the United Nations, the Palestinian cause was very much a topic of informal conversation in the corridors, and that several Arab ministers would press for a broader discussion of Arab conflicts when the foreign ministers meet again in Tunis in mid-November.
 
Closing a Policy Wedge
By alluding to the need for a resolution of the Arab-Israeli dispute, the Administration has also signaled to other United Nations members that the United States was not hypocritically selective in its devotion to United Nations resolutions.
The Administration is well aware that Iraq's argument that Washington has ignored United Nations resolutions that pertain to Israeli withdrawal from territory occupied after the 1967 war has sway on the Arab ''street,'' that is, among the Arab masses. To the extent that the Bush Administration has restated its commitment to implementing all United Nations resolutions that it voted for, it complicates Saddam Hussein's effort to rally support through lip service to the Palestinian cause.
Moreover, the speech served to close the policy wedge that President Hussein was attempting to pry open between France and the United States. By emphasizing the diplomatic option and some of the same themes as Mr. Mitterrand did, but in different words, the Administration was reinforcing French official assertions that Iraq could not hope to open a separate dialogue with Paris.
 
France a Bit Embarrassed
In his speech last week, President Mitterrand said that if Iraq affirmed its intentions to withdraw from Kuwait and release all hostages, then ''everything might be possible.'' France has been slightly embarrassed by Iraq's release of some of its hostages and Saddam Hussein's offer to open a dialogue with France following President Mitterrand's remarks.
''The message should finally have gotten across,'' one official stressed. ''There is no daylight between us.''
Finally, the emphasis in the United Nations speech on diplomatic initiatives has served to calm diplomatic nerves and shore up support among United Nations members who favor the embargo but are ambivalent about the use of military force. Their support or at least acquiescence would be required if the Administration decided that military force was necessary.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Iraq Blockade, Babies And the Milk Dispute

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Oct. 4

 BODY:
In the office of Dr. Mohammed Tawal, the director of the largest children's hospital in Iraq, and in the conference room and secretary's office that adjoin it, there are 13 images of President Saddam Hussein.
In Dr. Tawal's bookcase, there are fewer than a dozen medical books and pamphlets. Like virtually anyone who rises to a position of responsibility in Iraq, Dr. Tawal is Mr. Hussein's man, and he wishes visitors to know it.
Besides being shown in a formal photograph in a business suit, the 53-year-old Iraqi leader is represented on a bronze medal, a bronze wall plaque, two wooden etchings, three color photographs of him visiting the hospital, and a clock with his image on the face. There are also four other photographs of Mr. Hussein, busy about his duties as head of state, military commander and all-around tribune for the people of Iraq. 
When a group of Western reporters were summoned from their Baghdad hotels one morning this week, it was to be taken through Baghdad's busy traffic to the Alwiya Hospital, where the heavyset Dr. Tawal presides. The purpose was to demonstrate a point Mr. Hussein has been making with increasing shrillness during the crisis over Iraq's occupation of Kuwait: that the trade embargo imposed on Baghdad is threatening the health and lives of Iraqi children, among other things by denying them milk.
 
Skepticism Among Westerners
In his televised ''Message of Peace'' to Americans last week, Mr. Hussein held President Bush responsible for the milk shortages, and said the American leader ''will be cursed to the Day of Judgment'' for the policy. ''You ought to remember that thousands of children may die of malnutrition due to the lack of children's milk,'' he said.
The claim has been met with skepticism among Westerners' here, partly because as yet there are no critical food shortages. While powdered milk is scarce, families with children under the age of one are guaranteed one five-pound tin of it with the monthly rations of essential foods set by Mr. Hussein on Sept. 1. The tin, said to be enough to last a month, costs 3.50 Iraqi dinars, equivalent to $11.37 at the official exchange rate. An average Iraqi worker earns about 120 dinars a month.
Similar tins can be bought on the black market for the equivalent of $65 to $113, but traders offering the tins for sale today at stores along Sadoun Street, one of the city's newer thoroughfares, said business was not brisk. One trader, Kaatan Haider, said some of the prices for his imported food, though not for powdered milk, had actually declined since the invasion of Kuwai because large amounts of food from Kuwaiti stores had been ''brought north'' since Aug. 2.
Another cause for doubt about Mr. Hussein's assertions of imminent starvation among Iraqi children is the situation in the city's luxury hotels. While Mr. Hussein has been saying that Westerners here will be treated no better and no worse that Iraqis when it comes to scarce food, the breakfast buffet each morning at the Al-Rasheed Hotel, a modern sanctuary close to Mr. Hussein's sprawling presidential palace, offers jugs brimming with fresh milk. There are similar scenes at half a dozen other luxury hotels.
 
The Strongest Message
At the Alwiya Hospital, the message that came through strongest was not about starving children, or even hungry ones, none of whom were seen. Rather, the visit served as a token of how thoroughly most Iraqis have been inhibited by the harsh rule of Mr. Hussein, and how even professional people, many of them Western-trained and educated, appear to comply with whatever the Government requires of them, without pressing too hard for facts.
Partly, the message was about another feature of Iraqi life, the Government's stranglehold on news. While many Iraqis appear to have grown wary about Mr. Hussein's assertions on other matters, including the rationales he has offered for invading Kuwait, it has not been easy for people who depend on Government-run newspapers and broadcasting to sort fact from fiction in the barrage of statements about food. Although sophisticated Iraqis know that assertions of starving children were a response to American allegations of human rights abuses by Mr. Hussein, many others appear to believe that the United States is set on using starvation as a weapon.
At the hospital, even the doctors seemed unaware - or at least unwilling to acknowledge - that the United Nations embargo permits Iraq to acquire as much food, medicine and medical spare parts as it needs, so long as it meets United Nations conditions.
In the case of milk and other food needed to ''relieve human suffering,'' in the words of United Nations resolution 666 passed on Sept. 13, Baghdad has only to accept that delivery of the supplies be made by the United Nations, the International Committee of the Red Cross or ''other appropriate agencies.'' The stipulations on distribution arrangements were set under pressure from the United States and other Western countries, out of concern that emergency supplies might be diverted to the Iraqi Army.
 
Hussein Rejects Conditions
The ruling on medicines is still looser. In the Sept. 13 resolution, the Security Council exempted ''supplies intended strictly for medical purposes'' from the distribution arrangements set out for food, and recommended only that medical supplies be exported ''under the strict supervision of the government of the exporting state, or appropriate humanitarian agency.''
But so far Mr. Hussein has rejected the United Nations conditions. The question now is how long he will hold to his position.
At the Alwiya Hospital, the blame was put on Mr. Bush. Dr. Tawal, accompanied by Dr. Jawad Zayer, a neonatologist, and by Dr. Najla Naif, a gynecologist, spoke of the increasingly ''critical'' situation they faced. By their account, the hospital has been forced by shortages of milk, medicines and spare parts to shut down nearly half of its incubators, to close off a resuscitator in the neonatology department, and to cut back sharply on milk to babies.
But requests for details about the amount of milk available, and the amount given to babies in individual feeds, met with awkward silences. At one point, the doctors said they had no precise figures on the reduced feeds, then switched to saying that while the feeds remained the same, the cutbacks on the incubators meant that there were fewer babies to be fed.
''Stopping the supply of food and blood and milk is not a solution,'' Dr, Naif said, referring to demands that Iraq pull its troops out of Kuwait. ''If you go on with this, I think you will see children starving to death.''
She continued, ''And what will future generations think of the U.S.A. and other Western countries if they do that to Iraq?''

HEADLINE: U.S. Withdraws Nomination of Envoy to Myanmar

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
The State Department said today it had withdrawn President Bush's nominee for Ambassador to Myanmar because the country, formerly known as Burma, had protested remarks that the candidate made at his confirmation hearing.
The withdrawal of the President's choice, Frederick Vreeland, came one day after a Republican member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York, asserted that Mr. Vreeland had tried while in Rome in the early 1980's to discourage speculation that the K.G.B. had plotted to kill Pope John Paul II.
At the time, Mr. Vreeland was a clandestine officer with the Central Intelligence Agency, according to published accounts confirmed this week by Government officials. Mr. D'Amato had said he would seek a public hearing on the matter next week. 
In a statement released this evening, the State Department said that Mr. Vreeland's nomination was withdrawn after Government officials in the Burmese capital, Yangon, formerly known as Rangoon, summoned American diplomats on Tuesday to protest Mr. Vreeland's statements before the Foreign Relations Committee.
 
Remarks on Drugs and Politics
His comments on ''arms sales, possible economic sanctions on Burma, narcotics and internal Burmese political developments were unsatisfactory to the military regime,'' the State Department said.
But the department added, ''Mr. Vreeland's statements reflected the policy and the views of the United States Government.''
A Congressional official said tonight that Mr. Vreeland's remarks on those issues at the hearing did not appear to be intended to provoke the Myanmar Government.
The official said that a Democratic member of the foreign relations panel, Senator Alan Cranston of California, had assailed Myanmar's policies at the hearing, criticizing its arms buildup and saying that its leaders engaged in ''narco-terrorism.'' United States officials estimated last spring that nearly half of the world's supply of opium is grown in Myanmar.
In a telephone interview this evening, Mr. Vreeland said that officials in Myanmar had protested statements he made at the hearing in which he supported the right of Myanmar's citizens to determine their own form of government. He denied that Senator D'Amato's objections affected the fate of his nomination.
Myanmar's military Government allowed elections to be held in June, but has delayed seating the victors, apparently because they are opponents of the armed forces. The country has come under sharp criticism from the United States for its suppression of human rights.
It is unusual for a foreign government to object to the nomination of a United States Ambassador. But Congressional officials said today that some Foreign Relations Committee members had also become concerned about Mr. Vreeland's qualifications for what they consider an extremely sensitive diplomatic post.
One official said the panel's members were ''hindered by their inability to discuss it because of his clandestine background.''
Mr. Vreeland spent three decades with the C.I.A. working as an undercover officer, primarily in Western nations, using the identity of a State Department Foreign Service employee. Neither he nor the White House informed the Foreign Relations Committee of his C.I.A. background, Congressional officials said.
Asked about Senator D'Amato's statements that he played down Soviet involvement in the 1981 attack on the Pope, Mr. Vreeland said he ''would welcome the opportunity to discuss the charges with the Senator,'' and that they were not accurate.
Accusations of Soviet involvement in the attempt on Pope John Paul II have been widely reported, but have never been confirmed by the United States Government.

CORRECTION-DATE: October 6, 1990, Saturday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about the choice of a new United States Ambassador to Myanmar, formerly Burma, misstated the involvement of Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, who objected to the nomination of Frederick Vreeland. The Senator is not a member of the Foreign Relations Committee.

HEADLINE: Senator Stages Startling Comeback In Bid for Re-election in Rhode Island

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARWICK, R.I., Oct. 3

 BODY:
It was not hard, six months ago, to compile a long list of reasons that Senator Claiborne Pell, the shy, aristocratic 71-year-old Democrat from Rhode Island who heads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was ripe for defeat in this fall's elections.
After five terms, he seemed old and often absent-minded, especially by comparison with his aggressive, energetic 43-year-old Republican challenger, Representative Claudine Schneider. He had been rated as one of the worst members of the Senate by Washington Monthly magazine and accused of lackluster leadership of his committee by colleagues and newspapers. He had not had a tough electoral fight since 1972, when politics was more courtly.
Mr. Pell also holds a dangerous job. In the last two decades alone, no fewer than three chairmen of the committee the Senator now heads have been defeated - J. William Fulbright, Frank Church and Charles H. Percy. 
 
A Prime Republican Target
Republican tacticians in Washington rated Mr. Pell as one of their two or three prime targets for 1990, and Democrats shook their heads mournfully.
Now there are only five weeks left until Election Day, not very much time to turn things around. Mr. Pell leads one recent poll by 12 percentage points, another by 23. A Republican elder who once foresaw victory for Ms. Schneider said this week: ''I think her campaign is coming to an unfortunate close. Barring an act of God, he's going to win again.'' So what happened? To the outsider, Mr. Pell seems an anachronism, a throwback to the days when Northeastern states regularly sent people with patrician names like Saltonstall, Roosevelt, Frelinghuysen and Lodge to Washington. In an age of self-promoters, he is a self-effacing man who criticized a tub-thumping press release prepared by his campaign manager, Mary Beth Cahill, with the comment, ''No, no, we never boast.''
But in this rough-and-tumble state, populated largely by the descendants of Roman Catholic immigrants, Mr. Pell's unchallenged honesty, hard work on constituents' problems and good manners have broad appeal. His favorable rating in local opinion polls has not fallen below 75 percent in a decade.
 
Wide Regard for Senator
''Whatever they think in Washington,'' said Scott MacKay, a political reporter for The Providence Journal-Bulletin, ''people here think Pell is a nice man, and she hasn't given people any rationale for throwing him out.''
It's not that Ms. Schneider has lacked for openings. Mr. Pell is an indifferent campaigner who has said of himself, ''I have an uncanny facility for making the most exciting matters gray'' and who conceded last month, ''I'm perfectly capable of shooting myself in the foot.'' He nearly did so in a televised joint appearance with Ms. Schneider on Aug. 1, when he found himself unable, in response to a question, to think of examples of bills he had passed for Rhode Island.
But the next day, Iraq invaded Kuwait, and foreign policy, not television gaffes, took over the news broadcasts and front pages here. Before long, both were flooded with images of the Senator visiting Saudi Arabia. Although Mr. Pell's strategists here doubt it, others think he benefited hugely from the turn of events.
 
Key Role on Foreign Relations
''Voters are inclined to think that being chairman of Foreign Relations is a distraction, something irrelevant to their concerns,'' said Robert Squier, the Senator's media consultant. ''Now, suddenly, it matters, because their kids and brothers and sisters may have to go over there.''
Ms. Schneider has made a major effort to create an age issue, though she has done so indirectly, by emphasizing her vigor, by deriding ''the old-boy network'' in Washington and by talking of new answers for a new era.
''I've got fire in my belly,'' Ms. Schneider said in her announcement. ''He wasn't even sure for a while that he wanted to run again.''
But Rhode Island has the second-largest percentage of people over 65 years old of any state, and older voters remember with affection Mr. Pell's predecessor as senator and as Foreign Relations chairman, Theodore Francis Green, who served until he was 93. Mr. Pell marched in the July 4 parade in Bristol, evoking the past by wearing the same white suit he has worn for 30 years, but he also ran a 10,000-meter race the Sunday before he announced.
The Senator may have been helped as well by the recession that started taking hold here about six months ago. A clerk in an antiques shop in Providence said the other day that she liked Ms. Schneider, had voted for her for Congress and thought she would make a good senator in the future.
 
Sense of Security for Voters
''But not this year,'' she said. ''Things are bad, and Pell is about all we've got going for us in Washington. It's no time to change horses.'' Ms. Schneider, who has the backing of national women's groups and some environmental organizations, has spoken to economic concerns by criticizing Mr. Pell's vote for the savings and loan bailout and his backing for changes - ''tampering'' she calls them - in the Social Security system.
But her campaign has had its difficulties. The campaign manager, Ellen Conway, reportedly clashed with the candidate and then, in the midst of a troubled pregnancy, moved to Middletown, Ohio, where she is trying to keep in touch by phone and fax. A nautical pilot who endorsed Ms. Schneider's environmental record turned out to have been involved in an oil spill himself.
Despite the polls and other setbacks, Ms. Schneider has stuck to her commitment not to conduct a negative campaign against Mr. Pell, and as a result Rhode Island's campaign has probably been the most gracious Senate race in the country so far this year. In a television commercial in which she supports the use of the death penalty in some circumstances, she made her point gently: ''I know my opponent is concerned about crime, but I just think we have to get tougher.''
And in a television debate, Ms. Schneider pictured herself as the candidate focused on the future but added, ''We all love Claiborne Pell.''
 
No Need to Go Negative
Robert Rendine, her deputy campaign manager, said of the media strategy: ''You look at this type of message and see what kind of movement you get. We're very satisfied with our commercials, which point out the differences, however subtly, and we think they're working. We don't think there's any need to go negative, but we are ready to do whatever the candidate decides she wants to do.''
Some political analysts in Rhode Island think that a negative campaign would be counterproductive, at least at this stage of the campaign.
''It's too late,'' said Darrell M. West, a political science professor at Brown University who conducts its polls. ''Turning negative would run counter to her whole stance so far, and it would run counter to her political persona. She has positioned herself as a warm, caring individual, not as a Jesse Helms, always ready to attack. She would alienate Pell supporters and lose part of her own base.''
Seeking some insurance, perhaps, the Pell campaign has begun airing a commercial in which voters say things like ''Negative campaigning is going to backfire'' and ''Negative campaigning doesn't work, especially someone going negative on someone like Senator Pell'' and ''Don't down everybody.''

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET AGREEMENT;
Politics Denied in Greenspan Support

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
By the standards of a Federal Reserve chief, whose public utterances so often verge on the Delphic, Alan Greenspan's vigorous support for the proposed budget package was unusual.
Its authors in the Administration and Congress, he said on Wednesday, have ''crafted what appears to be a credible, enforceable reduction in the budget deficit over a number of years'' and failure to approve the deal would be ''a grave mistake.''
Is the Federal Reserve chairman, already under White House pressure to trim interest rates in support of a clearly sagging economy, to be regarded as having taken his endorsement cue from the Bush Administration and perhaps enlisted in the political sales effort as well? He is, after all, a longtime adviser to Republican Presidents, including Ronald Reagan, the man who appointed him.
 
No Politics, Fed Says
Fed officials, not surprisingly, categorically deny any political motivation in Mr. Greenspan's support, only mildly hedged, of the budget package. They say Mr. Greenspan was telling Congress just what he thinks - he acknowledged he would have preferred a somewhat different mix of tax increases and spending cuts - and would never allow himself to, say, make a few behind-the-scenes telephone calls to undecided members. 
''That is not our role, to lobby for something like this,'' said an assistant to the Federal Reserve Board, Joseph R. Coyne.
More importantly, and perhaps surprising to laymen, there is general agreement among students of the Fed about one thing. Mr. Greenspan did not hail the budget package because the White House told him to. Indeed, they say, he supported it with some trepidation, worried that it might appear that he was acting at the White House's behest.
Like Paul A. Volcker, his predecessor, Mr. Greenspan is not only a consummate economist but a political sophisticate. But he also knows that his ultimate effectiveness depends on keeping the Fed out of partisan politics.
 
Cardinal Banking Tenet
This is a cardinal tenet of central banking, said David M. Jones, chief economist for Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a dealer in Government securities.
''You do not want to be perceived as surrendering your independence to the whims of politicians,'' he said.
Professional Fed watchers also doubt that Fed chairmen tailor their comments or actions with an eye toward increasing their chances of being reappointed for another term. Mr. Greenspan will be up for reappointment in the summer of 1991.
While it is possible that President Bush made a direct appeal for Mr. Greenspan's support, specialists think this quite unlikely since Mr. Greenspan meets with and talks with Administration officials with great frequency and must be fully familiar with their views.
 
Breakfasts on Thursdays
Among scheduled occasions are breakfasts each Thursday with Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady and a monthly lunch at which the entire Fed board of governors gathers with the President's Council of Economic Advisers led by Michael J. Boskin.
Beyond his public statement in support of the budget package, Mr. Greenspan is expected to offset fiscal tightening with some monetary ease.
The current analytical debate involves two points: when to cut interest rates and by how much.
Mr. Greenspan's own testimony on the subject before the Joint Economic Committee in Congress underscores the notion that he will not let himself become a prisoner of the political budget process.
''What adjustments might be necessary and how they might be timed cannot be spelled out before the fact,'' he said. ''The actions required will depend on current economic conditions, the nature and magnitude of the fiscal package and the likely timing of its effects.''
 
Impact on Interest Rates
The Fed expects that long-term interest rates, which are what really count but move in accordance with market expectations of inflation, will be bid down as a result of the package and that the Fed can then follow by cutting the short-term rates over which it has considerable control.
An eight-times-a-year Federal Reserve strategy session on Tuesday at which the budget agreement was no doubt discussed at length, has yet to result in any perceptible easing of policy.
Mr. Greenspan appears to be insisting that the deal be actually signed into law before he begins to keep his part of the bargain.

HEADLINE: THE BUDGET AGREEMENT;
Gingrich, in Duel With White House, Stays True to His Role as an Outsider

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
In marching out of the White House and away from the Congressional leadership over the budget deal, Representative Newt Gingrich has picked up the only cloak that he seems truly comfortable wearing: renegade warrior, storming the barricades of politics as usual.
Mr. Gingrich's preference for the outsider's role was never more apparent than today, as the Republican whip in the House dueled with a President of his own party for the loyalty of fence-sitting House Republicans, and for their votes.
Lawmakers wooed this morning by President Bush over coffee and rolls at the White House, returned to Capitol Hill to find Mr. Gingrich's lieutenants trying to win them over with earnest talk about the ''tidal wave of anger'' in the country over new taxes.
The battle has also been waged over the airwaves, with each man countering the other's latest pronouncements several times a day. It is making for the most unusual political coalitions. 
 
Praise for 2 Democrats
Mr. Bush has aggressively plotted strategy with leading Democrats as well as the House Republican leader, Robert H. Michel. Rather than praise his President at a breakfast with reporters this morning, Mr. Gingrich singled out two Democrats: Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia and John R. Silber, who won the Massachusetts primary for Governor of Massachusetts. Both men, Mr. Gingrich said, will offer ''very formidable competition'' to the Republican Party.
What he did not have to say is that both men have also gone on record attacking the budget deal.
The newfound tensions between the President and the Republican whip were especially noticeable at a White House ceremony on Wednesday to honor Atlanta for snagging the 1996 Olympics. Mr. Bush did his best to steer clear of the Representative from Georgia. Mr. Gingrich allowed that they did not speak. ''We waved,'' he said. ''The President is a ferocious competitor.''
It may have surprised Mr. Bush that Mr. Gingrich showed up at all for the Rose Garden event. On Sunday, Mr. Gingrich was conspicuously absent from the Rose Garden gathering where Mr. Bush announced the budget agreement.
Mr. Gingrich said he could not stay silent over a package that he believes will set off a recession. ''I didn't do this lightly,'' he insisted. ''My intention is not to embarrass the President. My intention is to help this country to get an agreement which will increase jobs, improve the economy, create more revenues for the Government and create more take-home pay and opportunity for Americans.''
 
Gauging the Political Fire
But just how much political fire is Newt Gingrich playing with?
The way some leading Republican backers of the budget package see it, Mr. Gingrich's defection from the leadership, and from the Administration, was nothing short of political treason.
''You pay a penalty for leadership,'' snapped Bob Dole, the Senate Republican leader. ''If you don't want to pay the penalty, maybe you ought to find some other line of work.''
Representative Norman F. Lent, a Republican of Long Island, put it this way, ''He's exalting ideology at the expense of running a Government.''
Richard G. Darman, the Administration's budget director, dismissed Mr. Gingrich as a ''media phenomenon'' whose opposition to the budget agreement was ''a distraction'' but not ''lethal'' to the package.
Even Representative Nancy L. Johnson, a moderate Republican from Connecticut who supported Mr. Gingrich in his race for whip last year, shook her head in disappointment.
 
Criticism From a Moderate
''I disagree strongly with the way he has handled it,'' she said. ''I think he has been much too public, much too vocal. He has a responsbility as a whip to be much lower key. He hasn't had a lot of experience in this subtle business of when to discipline his own instincts.''
But Republicans who want to torpedo the budget plan are just as fervent in their praise for the 47-year-old former history professor.
Senator Trent Lott, a Mississippi Republican who was once House whip himself, defended Mr. Gingrich and said that the White House would eventually forgive and forget.
''They may get all pouty and get all nasty and shoot out the mouth,'' Mr. Lott said, ''but they'd better be careful how to handle this. This could hurt the White House, too.''
Recalling how as whip he initially opposed the Reagan White House on the 1986 tax package, and later recovered, Mr. Lott said, ''Even when you're in the leadership, occasionally you have to respond to your own conscience or be sensitive to your own constituency. Nobody marches to the drum major of the band every time.''
 
Newfound Respect for Gingrich
Representative Cass Ballenger, a North Carolina Republican, said he had new respect for Mr. Gingrich because of his stand.
''If the feeling in the country is, 'Dump the rascals and change everything,' '' he said, ''there is one person who stands for that position.''
The surest sign of whether Mr. Gingrich comes out a winner is by the House vote. But some of his supporters suggest that damage with the White House and leadership notwithstanding, Mr. Gingrich is only helping himself by playing the outsider.
Eddie Mahe, a Republican consultant and close friend of Mr. Gingrich, said the whip had re-established the unquestioned support of conservatives who doubted his loyalties when he joined the House leadership 18 months ago.
''Newt comes out a big winner with a lot of people in the country who think the agreement is bad, and he has the guts to say so,'' Mr. Mahe said. ''He has reasserted himself as the natural leader of the conservative movement.''
 
Question on Many Minds
Which again raises the question that everyone always seems to ask these days about Newt Gingrich, who clearly is relishing the attention this week: Would he be better off as the Republican bad boy or the loyal lieutenant, or can he have it both ways?
Mr. Gingrich, who has said he wants to lead the Republicans into the Congressional majority, brushed aside a question today about whether he really should be the Republican whip. Instead, he talks about the people.
''This is not going down because of Newt Gingrich,'' he asserted, referring to the budget agreement. ''The reason this is in trouble is the American people.''
Reflecting on the insider-outsider nature of Mr. Gingrich's political career, Representative Johnson came upon his realization: that while other lawmakers are restrained, he cannot help himself from speaking out.
''It think it's just his character,'' she said of his high profile effort to scuttle the budget deal. ''Ironically, that's one of the reasons we elected him whip.''

HEADLINE: Rewriting the Budget's Wrongs

 BODY:
The House's dumbfounding vote early this morning against the huge Federal budget compromise throws Washington and the U.S. Government into turmoil. It's far from clear that the $500 billion deficit reduction package, negotiated by Congressional leaders and the Bush Administration, can survive.
But even if ugly and unappreciated, some such package remains necessary, and with conscientious tinkering this one can be revised to promote fairness as well as the economy. 
The budget compromise, by itself, would impose higher taxes on beer, other alcoholic beverages, cigarettes and gasoline. These taxes fall hardest on low-income families, as the middle column of the accompanying table shows. Taxes would rise more than 7 percent for the poor but only 2 percent for the rich.
But if the compromise is supplemented by the child-care legislation pending in Congress, the tax effects would become very much fairer. The legislation would expand the earned income tax credit, supplementing the earnings of parents with low wages. The House version would offset the impact of higher excise taxes on the poor, as the right-hand column of the table shows. Congress would be fully justified in insisting that the Bush Administration accept the expanded tax credit before approving the budget pact.
Another precondition for Congressional approval would be to make the Medicare tax less regressive. Under current law, Medicare is paid in part by a payroll tax on earnings up to a ceiling of $51,300 and by monthly premiums that are the same for every beneficiary. The budget compromise calls for raising the earnings ceiling to $73,000, and the monthly premiums sizably.
There are better ways, well within the spirit of the budget compromise. Representative Pete Stark proposes lifting the ceiling even higher - to $150,000 - and holding monthly premiums down. An even better solution would be to link the premium to family income. Every beneficiary is heavily subsidized by the taxpayer; the best way for Congress to lower the deficit is to diminish taxpayer subsidies to the well-to-do.
Congress could also save some money by stopping a tax hemorrhage before it begins. The Administration insisted on the creation of new subsidies for investment in ''small'' companies. The hastily conceived language betrays the stated purpose. In fact, huge businesses with enormous debt but little equity would, it turns out, qualify for new subsidy.
A case can be made for carefully targeted assistance to venture-capital companies whose innovative efforts might throw off economic benefits to everyone. But the tax code ought not to be riddled with ill-conceived loopholes. Congress could insist on tightening these provisions strictly.
There is one problem with the budget pact that cannot be easily fixed. The compromise calls for only meager cuts in the military, saddling the country with unnecessary, expensive acquisitions for years to come. The only way out is corrective legislation next year.
The end of the cold war offers the opportunity to turn away from guns and invest in desperately needed infrastructure, education and social services. It's a historic opportunity; this year's budget negotiators hardly noticed.
In the meantime, Congress has the opportunity to improve this ugly, unavoidable budget. No kiss can turn this frog into a fair prince, but some conscientious effort can create fairer government.

HEADLINE: Persian Gulf Confrontation Hasn't Hurt U.S. Economy, Not Yet

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Leonard Silk discusses the argument that the United States economy has worsened since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in ''Uncertain Fallout From Gulf Crisis'' (Economic Scene column, Sept. 7). Count me among the ''sizable minority'' of optimists.
Before the invasion, with personal consumption sluggish, and housing and equipment investments down, final domestic demand was stagnant. But with exports stable and Government expenditures and inventory investment increasing, the economy was growing - though modestly; it was not in a recession. Did this situation change with the gulf crisis? 
The oil-price increases since then are likely to have weakened consumer confidence and therefore adversely affected personal consumption, but the negative effects are unlikely to have been substantial. Also, some increases in interest rates, which were already quite high, are unlikely to have substantially affected housing and equipment expenditures, which were already low.
Meanwhile, Government expenditures will increase because of the military deployment in the gulf region, and the declining dollar will help maintain the pace of exports. So the view that the Persian Gulf crisis has worsened the United States economy is more psychological than real.
Of course, increases in military expenditures can be a problem long term, and the economy has a host of other problems: a stubborn budget deficit and the credit crunch arising from the savings and loan fiasco, to name two. To be sure, continuation of the gulf situation in a stalemate will have negative consequences. For example, oil price increases may lead to economic stagnation in the European Community and elsewhere, and the cheap dollar may not be enough to sustain export growth.
The market insists that the Federal Reserve Board relax monetary policy. But even if the Fed were to cut interest rates without regard to budget deficit reductions, long-term interest rates would rise because of the strong fear of future inflation, creating a setting for stagflation. This persuades me that the Federal Reserve should maintain its neutral stance in monetary policy.
The insistence of economists that the economy has worsened because of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait will merely help cool consumer confidence - a negative effect, medium term. Rather, the role of economists should be to voice encouragement to enable President Bush to make decisive diplomatic and budgetary decisions.

HEADLINE: Deceit, Danger and the Deficit

BYLINE: By Ernest F. Hollings; Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina, is a member of the Senate Budget Committee.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The budget summit agreement confirms my conviction that these annual bipartisan love-ins aren't the cure - they're the cancer. Regrettably, the press has been distracted by the antics of Representative Newt Gingrich's rump faction in the House Republican Caucus and has failed to report the real deceit and danger in this deal.
First, the deceit: The summiteers assure us that their $500 billion in deficit reduction between 1991 and 1995 will balance the budget. It won't come close. 
The General Accounting Office concluded only last month that it will take closer to $1 trillion in deficit reduction to do that. Moreover, the summiteers resorted to economic assumptions that really put the rouge on old Rosy Scenario.
They've projected, for instance, 1992 economic growth at 3.8 percent and interest rates at 5.7 percent. The agreement's $500 billion objective is like throwing a 50-foot lifeline to a man drowning 100 feet offshore.
The tax provisions of this deal are a sham. With 10-cent gas tax increases and 8-cent cigarette tax increases, we are literally nickel-and-diming a trillion-dollar deficit problem. This agreement calls for only $16 billion in new taxes in 1991, yet fully $5 billion in new tax cuts next year - and all of the cuts are for the well-off.
So spare us the crocodile tears, Newt. As far as the President's core constituency of high-income G.O.P. voters is concerned, Mr. Bush fulfilled his campaign pledge not to raise their taxes. Indeed, the deal cuts their taxes by at least $25 billion over the next five years. The President claims the agreement ''does not mess with Social Security.'' It robs Social Security blind. It expressly provides that $169 billion will be ''borrowed'' from the Social Security trust fund between 1991 and 1995 in order to reduce the deficit. This deal insures that there will be no trust and no fund.
And neatly tucked away ''off budget'' are all new expenditures for the savings and loan bailout. At the same time, the statutory debt limit is extended for five years and then left open-ended. The game here is to grant Congressional authorization for a blank check to fund spending by the Resolution Trust Corporation, which claims it will need at least $100 billion more just to keep the bailout rolling for fiscal 1991. This ''off budget'' trick solves Congress's and the Administration's No. 1 political problem: keeping the savings and loan mess out of sight and out of mind.
Beyond the deceit, this agreement is positively dangerous. It officially kills any idea of a peace dividend. Gone are predictions of pushing defense budgets down to $250 billion over the next few years. Instead, the deal expressly locks in Pentagon budgets at no lower than $292 billion annually for the next three years.
What's more, the cost of Desert Shield in the Persian Gulf - whether it ends up at $5 billion or $50 billion -does not count against the $292 billion spending limit. Instead of a peace dividend, the agreement awards the Pentagon a war dividend by exempting it from significant cuts and giving it carte blanche in the gulf.
This is the real shame of this budget package. During the last year our nation has moved from the cold war to the trade war. We have a crying need for new investments in education and infrastructure to get our country moving and make it competitive. This budget deal offers a martial plan, not the domestic Marshall plan we desperately require.
The extremely low spending ceilings for domestic discretionary spending are not adequate to fund even current program obligations. Beyond that, the agreement assumes zero new initiatives by the self-styled Education President, Environmental President, Child Care President and his like-minded colleagues in Congress.
We are presented with a formula for a gridlocked Congress and a do-nothing Government for the next five years - during which time the budget agreement calls for at least $1.2 trillion in additional deficit spending. This may be O.K. for a President without an agenda. But America deserves an agenda - and a leadership willing to pay for it.

HEADLINE: THE TALK OF EDISON;
No Downtown in Town: New Jersey of the Future?

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EDISON, N.J.

 BODY:
If, as planners predict, New Jersey continues to become more suburb than city, Edison is what much of the state may look like in years to come.
Spread over 32 square miles near the center of the state, Edison has good roads, stable schools and even its own town dump. But because the township has grown so fast, the roads are often clogged with traffic, the schools have to be expanded, and the dump, almost full, will have to go the way of other local landfills and close by the end of the year.
So many people moved in over the last decade that Edison is now New Jersey's sixth-largest community, with more people than cities like Trenton, Camden and East Orange. Since 1980 it has grown by 27 percent, to 88,569 people, according to the preliminary 1990 census count. 
''Edison went development crazy in the 1980's,'' said Pat Schwalje, who moved here in 1981.
Edison's explosive growth has made it a model of suburban sprawl, without a downtown or much in the way of true neighborhoods. Thousands of town houses and condominium apartments in large developments sprang up in the township during the 1980's. In 1954, when it changed its name from Raritan Township to Edison Township, in honor of the inventor whose laboratories were once near the railroad tracks in the Menlo Park section, it was still primarily farm and field. Enough Is Enough? Connie O. Hughes, assistant director of occupational and demographic research at the New Jersey Department of Labor, said Edison's population spurt is further proof that New Jersey is the nation's most suburban state and is becoming even more suburban.
The state's master plan for future growth envisions established suburbs like Edison and neighboring Woodbridge becoming even more built up and, as they gain representation in Washington and Trenton, exercising even more influence in politics and government.
But some people already are saying enough is enough. Two large residential projects, at Raritan Center and the Dismal Swamp, have been delayed by local opposition. Attention has been focused on a rare patch of state-owned wetlands that is about to be sold to a developer who plans to build one million square feet of offices on it.
Conservationists say there is much to value in the 55 acres of scrub and marsh, which is near the Amtrak line and next to the suburban office complex known as MetroPark. The New Jersey Audubon Society calls it a signifcant wetlands that supports many species of birds. The Fish and Wildlife Service warned that the development would effectively destroy a crucial wildlife habitat.
How the land, which is part of the state's Veterans Memorial Home, came to be a building site involves a complicated series of events that residents say could only have happened with the approving eye of development-happy officials.
Someone first proposed doing something with the land in 1979, though at that time a far different project was proposed. Anthony M. Yelencsics, Mr. Edison to the residents he governed, with one brief interruption, for almost 30 years, was Mayor then, and he supported the idea of the J.F.K. Medical Center in Edison building an Olympic training center on the land.
With the prodding of Edison officials, the state declared the land surplus property. The State House Commission, a group of officials that must approve all transactions involving state land, authorized its sale. But the project died when the United States Olympic Committee withdrew its offer of financial support.
Without going back to the State House Commission for approval, the state offered the land for sale at a general auction in 1983. The successful bidder was the Alfieri Company of Edison, which has built more than one million square feet of offices in several buildings at the MetroPark complex. The price was $7.5 million.
The Aliferi Company made a $750,000 down payment, with the sale contingent on environmental approvals. Since then, the company says, it has spent more than $3 million on plans and studies to obtain the project's approval. The original plans were scaled back and modified so that the office building could be built on huge platforms that would allow water to flow through the wetlands that cover more than 80 percent of the 55 acres.
That modification removed the need for the Army Corps of Engineers to give its approval, because no longer would any wetlands be filled in. Last week, the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection issued a stream encroachment permit, the last major approval needed before construction can begin.
The president of the company, Dominick Alfieri, said the 55 acres were not valuable wetlands, but, in any case, construction would be limited to 11 acres, with the rest being kept open.
''This project does less damage environmentally to the state than if we went out and built a million square feet someplace else,'' Mr. Alfieri said.
But conservationists are stunned that such a project, on state land, could gain approval.
''Agencies all up and down the line have expressed concern about this,'' said David F. Moore, executive director of the New Jersey Conservation Foundation, a nonprofit environmental group. ''It should have been impossible to get that project that far.''
 
Rising Taxes
Big office buildings have played a big role in Edison's growth over the last few decades. The township does not have a downtown, but it is still a retail and business destination, with suburban office development and shopping centers spread along Routes 1 and 27 and in the sprawling Raritan Center, land formerly owned by the Federal Government and used as an Army arsenal.
One of the largest developments in Edison is The New York Times's highly automated production and distribution plant being completed close to Raritan Center.
Over the years Edison officials promised residents that warehouses and office buildings would help hold down taxes without straining township services. The former mayor so energetically followed that line that Edison often sold township land to encourage more development.
Commercial buildings now contribute almost 40 percent of Edison's taxes, and the local property tax rate is $1.63 per $100 of assessed value ($1.74 for families with garbage pick up), comparatively low for Middlesex County. But when public outcry stopped the land sales, tax revenues dropped and taxes went up, by 19 percent overall this year.
Some local citizens thought that they had been dealt a rotten deal and formed a group called Citizens Upset with the Tax Situation. They expressed their anger by holding meetings throughout the township to show homeowners how to file tax appeals.
In a clear outpouring of anti-tax sentiment, more than 2,000 owners challenged their tax assessments, more than five times the number of appeals filed last year.
The Edison Tax Assessor, Paul Raffiani, tried to play down the effectiveness of the organized protest. He said that in this year of tax revolt across the state, ''the only thing to attack is local taxes.''
But residents believe that because of all the development they put up with, they should not be paying taxes that, on average, exceed $2,500 a year. A typical house is assessed at $150,000.
''People that live here are feeling the effects of all that development,'' said Jane Tousman, a resident since 1970 who is a Republican candidate for Council in a township that is solidly Democratic. ''They are really feeling the pinch as far as the tax dollar is concerned.''
 
Busy, Busy Mayor
When taxpayers get angry enough, they tend to lash out at all aspects of government. In the last year some residents here have come to believe that their Mayor, a 61-year-old dentist and State Senator named Thomas H. Paterniti, may be as over extended as Edison itself.
In an interview, Mr. Paterniti denied that three jobs were too many. Talking at a frenetic pace and glancing at his wristwatch every few minutes, he said the secret to juggling so many responsibilities is ''the art of delegation and the ability to structure time properly.''
On the day of the interview he saw patients starting at 7:30. Then he raced to Town Hall in his new Corvette to meet department heads and perform two weddings. After eating a sandwich at a local diner, he saw more patients in the afternoon, gave the interview and then scooted off to some meetings and a final stop at his legislative office.
Moments after abruptly ending the interview because it was time to leave for the next meeting, Mr. Paterniti came running down the stairs, his dentist's smock already off, one arm in the sleeve of a dress shirt, waving papers that the visitor had left behind. Then, running back to his office, he shouted over his shoulder, ''I've got a citizens group at 7. Can't disappoint them.''

HEADLINE: Criticism Aimed At Statements On Immigrants

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
Recent comments by a New York civil rights leader that ''foreigners'' and ''newcomers'' have taken away jobs from black Americans have revived tensions between black and Hispanic people.
Hispanic civil rights advocates have criticized as insensitive and ''xenophobic'' remarks made during an interview on WBAI-FM last month by Hazel Dukes, the New York State president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, in which she said that black men have lost jobs to immigrants who did not speak English.
''It's a wonder they were even able to get those jobs,'' she said, according to a partial transcript published this week in The Amsterdam News. ''Why let foreigners, newcomers, have these jobs while blacks, who have been here for hundreds of years, can't support themselves or their families?'' 
In a prepared statement released yesterday, Ms. Dukes said she apologized if her remarks had offended Hispanic people. ''I have devoted my life in the fight for equal justice and opportunities,'' she said. ''I welcome to our city and our nation all races and nationalities and will continue to work hard until we obtain freedom and equal opportunity for all.'' She did not return phone calls seeking further comment.
 
'Great Deal of Tension'
Mayor David N. Dinkins, who earlier this year appointed Ms. Dukes, a longtime ally, to the presidency of the board of the Offtrack Betting Corporation, limited his remarks to reading Ms. Duke's written statement.
But her original remarks have troubled members of the Hispanic community, who said yesterday that while they understood the frustration engendered by high unemployment among black men, it was unfair to blame Hispanic immigrants who held the type of hotel and restaurant jobs cited by Ms. Dukes.
''There is a great deal of tension between the Hispanic and black communities,'' said Raul Yzaguirre, president of the National Council of La Raza, a Hispanic civil rights organization. ''It is something that is deeply felt by both communities and is going to get worse before it gets better.''
It is the second time this year that the issue of recent immigrants taking jobs from black Americans has increased tensions between the two groups.
Last spring, Mr. Yzaguirre's organization and the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund threatened to resign from the nation's premier civil rights coalition, the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, in part because the national N.A.A.C.P. refused to call for the repeal of provisions of the Immigration Reform and Control Act that mandated sanctions against employers who hired undocumented aliens.
Some blacks supported the sanctions because they feared recent immigrants were squeezing blacks out of the labor market. Hispanic rights advocates, however, said employer sanctions resulted in discrimination against Hispanic people, and they defined opposition to the sanctions as a test of support for their civil rights.
An 11th-hour compromise, followed by the national N.A.A.C.P. calling for the repeal of employer sanctions in July, averted the threatened pullout. Benjamin L. Hooks, the N.A.A.C.P.'s executive director, said Ms. Dukes played a major role in persuading the organization to oppose employer sanctions.

HEADLINE: A Stack of Messages;
First Said to Lack Leadership, Mayor Is Now Said to Go in Many Directions

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins demonstrated on three fronts this week the leadership that critics had repeatedly complained that he lacked. But now he seems to be leading the city in several directions at once.
Four days of proposals and pronouncements have confounded critics and raised questions of whether seemingly inconsistent decisions by the Mayor are the result of calculation or are the product of an administration that either is without a cohesive strategy or is unable to articulate one.
What message was Mr. Dinkins trying to convey by announcing on Monday a surprisingly generous contract settlement with the teachers union, a sweeping plan on Tuesday to expand the police force, a selective hiring freeze on Wednesday and yesterday the prospect of as many as 15,000 layoffs - the most serious potential jolt to the municipal work force and to municipal services since New York City's fiscal crisis erupted in 1975. 
''We cannot and should not deal with the very serious financial problems we confront in a piecemeal fashion,'' Elizabeth Holtzman, the City Comptroller said yesterday, suggesting by implication that the administration had been doing just that.
This is not the first time that the nine-month-old administration seemed to be sending mixed messages.
In Mr. Dinkins's inaugural address, he promised to be New York's toughest mayor on crime. Two days later, to help close a projected budget gap, he postponed the planned hiring of more police officers - a decision that was hailed by some skeptics who had feared that, given the political support he had received from organized labor and his record on behalf of social causes, he would be more profligate than his predecessor.
During the summer, responding to the perception and the reality that crime was surging in the city, Mr. Dinkins was accused of indifference when he failed to follow the lead of other public figures and explicitly promise to hire thousands more police officers -a proposal he finally made in detail on Tuesday after reviewing a deployment study by his Police Commissioner.
And then, when various fiscal overseers expressed concern that the city could not afford the precedent that the teachers pact might set for other unions and, perhaps, even the proposed expansion of the police and other services to deter crime, Mr. Dinkins appeared to shift gears at midweek from a policy of spending to one of austerity.
Yesterday, he sought to dispel the notion that he had been largely reactive, saying instead that he was balancing competing demands.
''What we must do,'' Mr. Dinkins said, ''is strive mightily to keep our eye on the ball and try to do that which is in the best interest of our city.''
To be sure, the Mayor had been warning for weeks that he would hire only as many police officers as the city could afford and that the mammoth deficit being projected for the next fiscal year would have to be dealt with, too. But he apparently failed to convey its possible consequences.
''The Mayor has been saying all along that we're facing big problems,'' his budget director, Philip R. Michael, said yesterday. ''But maybe we've been talking in subtleties.''
Yesterday, Mr. Michael issued a gloomier prognosis, estimating that the gap next year could approach $1.4 billion. Ms. Holtzman warned that it could soar to almost $2.6 billion.
Also yesterday, the State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, predicted that the police expansion plan and contract settlements comparable to the proposed teachers pact would produce an increase in city-financed spending of 11 percent this year - the largest increase in a decade.
 
'Not Sustainable'
''To put it bluntly,'' Mr. Regan said, ''given the city's stricken economy and the sharp drop in tax revenue growth, such spending is not sustainable.''
In its defense, the Dinkins administration has said that its police plan was accompanied by a list of proposed taxes to pay for it. Also, it said that only 1.5 percent of the teachers settlement would be paid from the city budget, with much of the rest coming from savings in the city's contribution to its pension fund.
Ominously, Mr. Dinkins, who was elected in part because of his reputation as a conciliator, apparently had not consulted the unions before yesterday's announcement, much as, on Tuesday, he announced a proposed payroll tax on commuters to help pay for more police officers even after aides to the Governor informed their counterparts at City Hall that the proposed tax was doomed.
Some of the monitors also wondered whether the timing of the hastily issued warning about deficits and layoffs was simply an effort to get the bad news out fast and respond accordingly or whether the city was posturing as it bargains with other unions. Mr. Michael insisted, though, that some layoffs would be ''an essential ingredient'' of any plan to close next year's gap.
But would they be worth the cost of 5 percent pay raises for the remaining employees? Would attrition be less destructive, even to a work force that some say is bloated, having grown by nearly 50,000 in five years?
Were this week's pronouncements a message to the state Legislature, from which the city wants relief and taxing power? Or will the administration suggest later that they were part of some broader strategy to transform several crises into an opportunity to alter the city's spending priorities?
Mr. Dinkins had no announcements scheduled for today.

 BODY:
GEORGE SOROS, the investment adviser who has become the philanthropist of Eastern Europe, will receive the Human Rights Award from the Lawyers Committee for Human Rights.
About 11 years ago, after Mr. Soros had built the Quantum Fund into one of the most successful international investment funds, ''I was making more money than I had use for,'' he wrote in ''Opening the Soviet System,'' recently published by Weidenfeld & Nicholson. Mr. Soros began hunting for worthy causes and established the Soros Foundation to award give scholarships in Hungary, his native country. 
From this grew a network of foundations in central and Eastern Europe, including the Soviet Union, managed by 85 people from nine countries. Mr. Soros, now a New Yorker, estimates that he has given between $10 million and $20 million to them. Now he's trying to help establish a University of Central Europe, in Prague and in Budapest, where he was born 60 years ago. He has pledged $25 million to the project over five years.
Last week, thanks to his financing, a delegation of Soviet economists who are promoting a 500-day economic reform program attended the meeting of the International Monetary Fund in Washington. ''I'm an advocate of an open society,'' Mr. Soros said. ''So my aim has been to help in the transformation of closed societies.''
The human rights award honor will be presented given him atat a dinner at the Waldorf on Oct. 15 by PAUL A. VOLCKER, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank, and WILLIAM D. ZABEL, a lawyer.

Accusations over one firm's fees bring on a new war between the states.

BYLINE: By David Margolick

 BODY:
Two distinct parts of the country, ostensibly united but with their own customs and loyalties, coexist, at times uncomfortably. The smaller, less-populated region feels the larger one is imposing its own, uncongenial way of life on it. It bristles, then chafes, then rebels. Skirmishing breaks out, with no end in sight.
It may sound like the first episode of the Public Broadcasting Service's recent series on the Civil War. But it could just as easily be applied to a legal battle brewing in Bridgeport, one involving the very different lawyers and legal practices of New York and Connecticut. 
The case pits three Connecticut entrepreneurs, Peter Lathouris, Chris Handrinos and George Katsaros, against the New York law firm of Willkie, Farr & Gallagher, which they retained to wage a proxy fight for control of a Norwalk bank. Like the Union Army at Bull Run, the businessmen lost that opening skirmish, but the worst was yet to come. When the smoke cleared, Willkie's bill stood at $358,000 for one month's work.
Calling the figure ''staggering and totally, totally outrageous,'' the clients refused to pay.
More than that, they made two novel claims: First, because Willkie lawyers are technically not licensed to practice in Connecticut, they have no right to collect the fee; second, the bill violated Connecticut ethical rules barring lawyers from charging unreasonable fees. Or, as the businessmen's new lawyer, L. Douglas Shrader of Bridgeport, puts it, what is reasonable on New York's Wall Street may not be on Norwalk's.
One might expect, a la the medical profession, that one lawyer would be reluctant to attack another lawyer's fee. But asked about the case, Mr. Shrader all but shrieks out one of those rebel yells much beloved by Confederate soldiers. As he sees it, he is striking a blow for his state. The case, he told The Connecticut Law Tribune, ''is my 'Field of Dreams.' ''
To him, the case represents his chance to speak up for lawyerly honesty, moderation, civility and professionalism, all of which, he suggests, have disappeared in New York and would in Connecticut, too, if the invaders are not repelled. He charged that megafirms like Willkie, spoiled by years of representing credulous clients with bottomless pockets in New York, failed either to economize or to level with his clients when it came carpetbagging to Connecticut.
''They came in here with an 8-inch gun to hit a fly,'' Mr. Shrader said.
Brian O'Connor, a partner at Willkie's New York office, disputed that. ''It isn't that we gouged them,'' he said. ''We sat them down and told them what it would cost. They're sophisticated people. Mr. Lathouris is an attorney himself.'' Far from protecting homely values, he said, Mr. Shrader was out to generate some newfangled publicity for himself, as well as to exact some concessions for his clients.
The saga began in August 1989, when Mr. Lathouris and his associates gave Willkie a $30,000 retainer to represent them in their attempted takeover of the Norwalk Bank. James A. Testa of Willkie has said he told Mr. Lathouris the job could run as high as $500,000 a month. Mr. Lathouris counters he was assured that $250,000 would cover everything. Nothing was committed to writing. After a month of furious activity, which saw one Willkie lawyer bill for 10 hours a day for 31 consecutive days, that campaign was over; the proxy fight failed. Fort Sumter occurred when Willkie presented its bill: $358,827.03, for 895 hours of work. That included some $47,000 for expenses: hotels, meals, taxis. It was at least three times what he expected to pay, Mr. Lathouris said. His ''city slicker'' lawyers were ''raking over'' their ''country bumpkin'' clients.
''We expected to pay a substantial amount of money, but not $10,000 a day for 30 days,'' he said. ''They were very competent, but I think there was just plain old overreaching on their part.'' As for the expenses, he added: ''I don't see why, for God's sake, if the firm hires a limousine to carry everyone around we should pay for that. If I did that I'd probably be chased out of town.''
Willkie only made things worse, he said, by the most un-Connecticut-like way it has handled things since. He charged that Bruce Montgomerie, the Willkie partner to whom he complained about the bill, ''sort of pounded the table in a very arrogant manner and said 'Bring us a check and then we'll talk.' '' (Mr. Montgomerie disputed that characterization. ''I was quite courteous to him and I did not pound on the table,'' he said.) Things turned even nastier in August, when Willkie's lawyer, Stewart Edelstein, moved in Bridgeport Superior Court to put liens on the the homes of Mr. Lathouris and his partners. It is unclear who will play Grant and who Lee when the case reaches Appomattox.
By the way, Mr. Edelstein is from Connecticut.

The Genius of Mexico, Before Its Long Sleep Under Spain and After

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
THE impression unfolds by the time a viewer has passed the colossal sculptures on either side of the museum's lobby and admired the Olmec seated figure who presides over the entranceway to the exhibition. By the end of the show - after the rooms of Mayan and Aztec sculptures and carvings and jewelry and the hundreds of paintings and objects spanning the period from the Spanish conquest in the 16th century to the middle of the 20th century - there can be no doubt: ''Mexico: Splendors of 30 Centuries,'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, is an epic display.
It is epic not simply in terms of scale, although with more than 350 objects, many of them enormous, the show ranks with the most ambitious the museum has undertaken. More important, it is epic in the story it tells, for despite the gaps that are intrinsic in any exhibition covering such a vast span of time, the show cannot fail to leave a visitor with a heightened sense of the length and breadth of Mexican civilization. It is one of the few blockbusters that can be said to transcend the diplomatic and economic considerations that underlie it. 
To chauvinists who still think that American culture began with the arrival in the New World of Europeans during the 15th century, ''Mexico'' is a profound rebuttal. To those who believe that the history of 20th-century art in America is the history of the art of the United States, ''Mexico'' is also a reminder of the towering contributions by painters like Jose Clemente Orozco, Frida Kahlo, David Alfaro Siqueiros and Diego Rivera.
The exhibition - now in preview for museum members and opening to the public on Wednesday - does not pretend to be comprehensive: the survey of Mexican art stops around 1950. But throughout New York City there are, over the course of the next several months, dozens of exhibitions and other events, organized to coincide with the Metropolitan's display, that attempt to round out the picture of Mexican culture during this century.
At the I.B.M. Gallery of Science and Art, for example, is ''Mexican Painting: 1950-1980,'' a group of about 40 works generally so dismal that the show functions principally as an argument for the chronological limits of the Metropolitan's exhibition. On the other hand, the National Academy of Design is presenting ''Women in Mexico,'' a show of some 100 paintings, photographs and drawings, which includes an assortment of canvases by Kahlo and Maria Izquierdo at least as impressive as the works by those two artists in the Metropolitan's display.
The National Academy exhibition, for all its unevenness and for all the drawbacks of its preachy catalogue, also underscores what ''Mexico'' can only imply - that despite the cliches of a machismo culture, an impression perpetuated by muralists like Rivera and Orozco, the art of Mexico in this century cannot be written without homage to the contributions of Tina Modotti, Olga Costa, Lilia Carrillo, Kahlo, Izquierdo and other women.
Different histories of Mexican culture than the one on view at the Metropolitan could, of course, still be constructed, histories that placed more value in the objects produced in villages than cities, that included fewer paintings and sculptures and more artifacts of everyday use. Such histories might have shown the course from pre-Columbian through the present to be somewhat less disjunctive and episodic than the Metropolitan's exhibition.
One of the most unforgettable passages in ''Mexico'' is the abrupt transition from the final pre-Columbian gallery to the first gallery of art documenting the era of the Spanish conquest. There could be no more dramatic testimony to the violent upheaval that marked the founding of New Spain and the virtual obliteration of the native culture. Only somewhat less marked is the change from the art of the 19th century, with all its echoes of bourgeois European taste, to the art of post-revolutionary Mexico, with its emphasis on nationalism and independence and its revival of pre-Columbian forms.
The exhibition, like the history of Mexico, thus breaks into roughly three parts, and in many ways the first provides the most impressive series of monuments, beginning with that seated figure in elaborate headdress, cape and belt, discovered at La Venta, one of the centers of Olmec civilization from roughly 1,000 B.C. until it was mysteriously abandoned around 400 B.C. In this figure are evident several of the characteristics that emerge as links among the divergent cultures of the Olmecs, Mayans and Aztecs - the emphasis on bold abstract patterning, the starkly dramatic poses, and perhaps most significantly, the evocations of the otherworldly. Pre-Columbian art is rife with both the terrifying and the sublime. Near the Olmec seated figure, for example, can be found grotesqueries like the lidded ceramic vessel in the shape of a hunchback, his face covered with ulcers and his mouth gnarled in pain.
What to make of such an unsettling object? Pre-Columbian art is obsessed with the unusual - feathered serpents, deformed men. Transformation was an idea of particular attraction to these ancient cultures, and no transformation seems more pervasive than the one from human to jaguar, one of the animals most revered in Mexico as a symbol of supernatural powers. For this reason, the peoples of the Pacific coastal region of Chiapas erected pedestals in the shape of seated jaguars, their fangs bared, perhaps as warning against intruders, both corporeal and divine.
Still, in one work after another, it is not the drama but the extreme fineness of craftsmanship that ultimately seduces a viewer. This is apparent with a A.D. seventh-century aquiline head found at the tomb of the Temple of the Inscriptions at Palenque. And it is the case with the rubbings of sarcophagus reliefs from Palenque, some of the most richly decorated and sophisticated sculptural programs in the history of pre-Columbian art.
From other important archeological sites, including Teotihuacan, El Tajin, Chichen Itza and the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan, have come major works. When the Spanish first saw cities like Tenochtitlan, they were awestruck. One 17th-century Spanish chronicler wrote about the city of Tlatelolco: ''Some of the soldiers with us had been in many parts of the world, in Constantinople and all over Italy and Rome, and they said they had never seen a public square so perfectly laid out, so large, so orderly, and so full of people.'' It is not difficult to imagine their astonishment from the concise assemblage of Aztec stone carvings and gold jewelry that have been brought together at the Metropolitan. Here is a masterpiece of complex and lively design in the form of a stone feathered serpent from around 1500. Here is a huge basalt sculpture of a sea-shell, evidence of a tradition of naturalism that also produced the Olmec hunchback. Here, too, is the seated figure of Huehueteotl, the fire god, whose meaty hands and rough features would seem to have inspired, centuries later, painters like Rivera and Orozco.
No object sums up the radical transition from pre-Columbian to Spanish better than the column base with earth monster relief from the mid- 16th century, an object in European style but adorned by the Indian artisan who made it with an Aztec design. In the imposing and ornate 16th century stone cross from the Basilica of Guadalupe in Mexico City and in the codises from the same period that were illuminated by Indian artists there are also remnants of the great culture that the Spanish conquerors had done all they could to eliminate.
But for the most part, the middle section of the exhibition, covering the 16th through the 19th centuries, describes a society whose culture had been largely grafted from abroad. To be sure, there are magnificent objects from this period, including the 16th-century manuscript illumination by Luis Lagarto of ''The Annunciation''; the 17th-century polychromed wood sculpture of San Felipe de Jesus, and the gilded and painted retablo from the chapel of the Jesuit hacienda of Santa Lucia near Mexico City.
The portrait of Sor Ignacia de la Sangre de Cristo is not only an example of meticulous technique, but also a touching depiction of a girl who seems altogether unsure of the life that awaits her in a convent. As it happened, Mexican convents became centers of learning for women, who were otherwise denied an education, and several of the country's most impressive literary figures of the 17th and 18th centuries, in particular Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz, were nuns. The extravagant pulpit in bone, bronze, wood and silver from the convent church of Santa Rosa in Queretaro provides, in its mixture of Asian and European motifs, proof of Mexico's status during the 18th century as an important juncture on the trade routes between the Philippines and Spain. And from the 19th century there are more surprises, like the searching portraits by Hermenegildo Bustos and the intricately painted ex-votos, which inspired artists like Kahlo.
Yet it is in the 20th century that Mexican art re-emerges with a full measure of independence, not as a response but as an answer to European culture. In place of easel painting came the revival of the ancient Mexican tradition of the mural.
With this final section of the exhibition, the Metropolitan's display becomes weakest, the selections uninspired and the rooms overstuffed with paintings. Of course, murals do not easily travel. A fresco by Rivera depicting Emiliano Zapata gives the only direct sense of the works done on the walls of public buildings to celebrate the revolution.
Still, through other paintings and drawings a viewer can discern Rivera's passage from a kind of generic Cubism to a style entirely his own, and markedly divergent from the works of Orozco and other artists with whom he is typically but too loosely linked.
As for the Surrealists who responded to the example of the muralists with a visual language as private as the language of Rivera and Orozco was public, ''Mexico'' offers works by painters like Kahlo, Izquierdo, Julio Castellanos, Antonio M. Ruiz and Rufino Tamayo. To this list can be added contemporary artists like Flor Garduno and Lucero Isaac, both of whom are represented in ''Women in Mexico'' at the National Academy of Design. The obsession with the bizarre and supernatural that is so much on view throughout the pre-Columbian period finds its echo centuries later, in the works of these 20th-century Mexican artists. In this sense, where the extraordinary story of ''Mexico'' begins, it also ends, on a strange and fantastical note. ''Mexico: Splendors of 30 Centuries,'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, is open for previews to individual and dual museum members through Tuesday and is open to the public from Wednesday to Jan. 13. It travels to the San Antonio Museum of Art (April 6 to Aug. 4, 1991) and the Los Angeles County Museum of Art (Oct. 6 to Dec. 29, 1991). ''Women in Mexico'' remains at the National Academy of Design, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, through Dec. 2. ''Mexican Painting: 1950-1980'' remains at the I.B.M. Gallery of Science and Art, Madison Avenue and 56th Street, through Nov. 24.

Back to the Classroom For a Frustration Lesson

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
Act I of ''Stand-Up Tragedy,'' the new play by Bill Cain at the Criterion Center, is labeled ''First Semester'' in the Playbill. Act II is ''Second Semester.'' Make no mistake about it: The audience is in school, and there's no use praying for early dismissal.
The school in question is a small Roman Catholic institution for Hispanic boys on the present-day Lower East Side. The lesson Mr. Cain wishes to impart is sadly perennial: the impotence of inner-city schools in their front-line battle to rescue young lives from the ravages of poverty, absent and abusive parents and drugs. Who would doubt that the crisis in urban education is the most pressing American tragedy? That makes it all the more painful to report that ''Stand-Up Tragedy'' - whether viewed as a serious effort to illuminate its issues or merely as pop entertainment with a conscience - is so often a farce. 
The author, who himself taught at a school like the one in his play, is obviously sincere in his frustration. The story he tells, however familiar from fiction, is presumably drawn from first-hand experience: The only faculty member hip enough to wear Nikes, a Georgetown-educated yuppie named Tom Griffin (Jack Coleman), sets out to salvage an unexpectedly gifted student, Lee Cortez (Marcus Chong), who might otherwise be devoured by his violent family or lost in the housing-project maze or the educational morass. Yet Mr. Cain never takes this premise or its characters any further than the archetypal tableaux that have been served up with far more vigor in works as various as ''Blackboard Jungle,'' ''Up the Down Staircase,'' ''To Sir With Love,'' ''Open Admissions'' and even ''Room 222.'' At a time when authors like Diane Ravitch and Samuel G. Freedman, among others, are prominently examining the same classrooms seen in this play, seeking to learn from their small victories and big defeats, Mr. Cain merely restates the obvious, parading the familiar symptoms of a social calamity before the audience without offering any diagnosis or, at the very least, fresh observations. Rather than risk offending anyone by raising any controversial questions about the church's exact educational role in a city riddled by AIDS and racism, he settles instead for the middlebrow theater's sentimental boilerplate of moral concern, as typified by a monologue in which the school's presiding priest (Charles Cioffi) argues his students' need for ''a better God.'' (Not for nothing does this play share an originating theater, the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles, with ''Children of a Lesser God.'') Finally Mr. Cain just throws up his hands in despair, disposing of as many characters as possible in a denouement that, for all its tragic pretensions, proves laughably melodramatic.
Were it not for the stylization of the writing and Ron Link's production, ''Stand-Up Tragedy'' would merely be another innocuously topical television movie that had somehow strayed onto a Broadway stage. But the gimmickry of the script, which attempts to appropriate the hard-edged styles of both stand-up comedy and rap music, and the noisy busyness of the staging, in which synthetic rap numbers and gruntingly gymnastic choral recitations are punctuated by the incessant banging of lockers and ringing of school bells, do succeed in insinuating ''Stand-Up Tragedy'' into a theatergoer's mind - if not as an intellectual or emotional stimulant, then as the relentless source of a throbbing headache.
''Stand-Up Tragedy'' lowers the volume of its assault only when some of its actors, most notably Mr. Cioffi, wait for laughter at the end of a punch line. Unfortunately, Mr. Cain just isn't a witty enough writer to score with the teachers-lounge wisecracks he uses to avoid an actual dramatization of what happens in his play's school. The gags, like the frequently inaudible and always white-bread rap lyrics, are filler.
An even more irritating jokeyness is injected by the arbitrary assignment of multiple roles to the principal actors. Mr. Chong, a promising performer in need of editing and direction, is asked to interrupt and compromise his portrayal of the sensitive Lee by repeatedly impersonating Lee's mother in a manner more appropriate to a ''Forbidden Broadway'' spoof of Rita Moreno. Mr. Coleman, an ingratiating figure as the earnest teacher, is in turn asked to adopt an embarrassingly ersatz Hispanic accent to impersonate Lee's brother -even as Mr. Chong sometimes plays Lee's brother, too, in tandem. This is theatricality, I guess, but other than providing acting exercises for an enthusiastic young cast, what goal does it serve?
A cynic might assume that the real point of the awkward and confusing piggybacking of roles is to save money on actors, but if so, the economies have not extended to the employment of two black performers who, though costumed as students and always used in the rap routines, remain patronizingly undifferentiated as characters throughout. It's rather bizarre to find a contemporary slice-of-life high school drama emulating a Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland vehicle of yesteryear by padding the class with faceless chorus boys. But once they and other members of the all-male cast gratuitously start stripping to the waist late in Act II, one can at least relax in the happy knowledge that the school in ''Stand-Up Tragedy'' is finally adjourning for summer camp.

Adding Up The Decades For 2 Pianists

BYLINE: By PETER WATROUS

 BODY:
The pianists Hank Jones and Kenny Barron, who are performing this weekend at Bradley's and the Village Vanguard, respectively, can amass a list of artistic associations that sounds like a jazz history book. In 1944, for example, the Detroit-born Mr. Jones arrived in New York City to play with the trumpeter Oran (Hot Lips) Page. He went on to work with the likes of Coleman Hawkins, Ella Fitzgerald, Miles Davis, Charlie Parker, Billy Eckstine, Cannonball Adderley, and his own brothers, Thad and Elvin.
For Mr. Barron, who left Philadelphia nearly 30 years ago to settle in New York, collaborators have included James Moody, Dizzy Gillespie, Yusef Lateef, Freddie Hubbard, Roy Haynes, Joe Henderson and Ron Carter. In the 1980's, Mr. Barron was a founding member of the group Sphere, which played, among other things, the music of Thelonious Monk. 
All the experience paid off: the two are now among the finest musicians in jazz. While young jazz musicians have recently received breathless praise as well as major label contracts, the best musicians in jazz have always been the more experienced improvisers.
 
An Informal Education
''When I was coming up as a young musician, we could work in hundreds of clubs,'' said Mr. Barron, who is 47 years old. ''I worked with my brother Bill in the mid-1960's, along with Ted Curson, and we used to do one-night things all over town, at Birdland and the Village Vanguard. I worked with James Moody at the Five Spot; that was my first big gig. Then with Roy Haynes, who had Frank Strozier and Henry Grimes in the band. And then with Dizzy.
''It was great experience because the older musicians showed us how to pace ourselves, to save ourselves for the difficult moments. But we learned all kinds of things - tunes and concepts. From Dizzy, for instance, I gained a real appreciation for be-bop and Latin music. And when I left, I worked with Freddie Hubbard, whose tunes were really hard but allowed me to stretch out into areas that might be called avant-garde. And when I worked with Ron Carter, I learned about nuances, how to play soft and still be intense.''
Mr. Barron, who has been teaching at Rutgers University for 19 years, has usually been heard leading his own trio, a group that can fit the economic requirements of smaller clubs. But he is taking a sabbatical this year, and he has re-formed a hard-blowing and intense group he has only occasionally worked with. It includes Eddie Henderson on trumpet, John Stubblefield on tenor saxophone, Cecil McBee on bass and Victor Lewis on drums.
''When I work with this group, I try to avoid the jam-session sound, partially by playing my own material,'' Mr. Barron said. ''You have to make a band sound like a group effort, which makes it exciting for the audience. And once the music is written, I don't want to enforce too many parameters; I like the way Miles Davis led his band. He let it develop however it developed. The idea is that you hire these people for certain things they're good at, rather than having them do exactly what you want.''
 
'Stretching and Taking Chances'
In the last decade, Mr. Barron's abilities have blossomed. A typical solo of his moves from spare single-note melodies to flourishes and huge chords used percussively as punctuation. And it always swings deeply. ''Jazz is about stretching and taking chances,'' Mr. Barron said. ''It took me a long time to realize that. Everybody has hang-ups, and I was always worried about approval, about whether people liked what I was doing. Now, if I hear something, I'll try it, and if I make a mistake, I make a mistake and don't worry about it much; if people don't like it, too bad.''
Where Mr. Barron moves easily through the history of the jazz piano, adding occasional clusters to his playing and juxtaposing ideas, Mr. Jones works with continuity. His solos, unruffled and exact, glide easily. And like Mr. Barron, Mr. Jones, considered the dean of jazz pianists, is a master at taking the familiar - a tune or a set of harmonies - and reworking it on the spot. Mr. Jones is part of an extraordinary trio put together by the bassist Ray Drummond that also includes the drummer Billy Higgins. Next week, the trio will record, under Mr. Drummond's name, for DMP, a small independent label.
''This gig has been a dream of mine for the last seven years,'' Mr. Drummond said. ''Hank's a great player and the leading exponent of the Detroit school of piano playing, and all the pianists from Detroit - Hugh Lawson, Tommy Flanagan, Kirk Lightsey, Roland Hanna - have the ability to project their personalities through a cold instrument.''
 
'A Collective Mind'
The band will be playing mostly standards. And it will not be rehearsing or using arrangements, a practice that is neither arrogant nor taking advantage of the audience. At their level, these musicians can make their improvisations, full of interplay and nuanced suggestion, sound planned. ''There's lots of improvisation,'' said Mr. Jones, who is 72 years old. ''We take the material and come out with something personal. The musicians are so highly disciplined and the individual personalities are so well developed we can come up with a collective mind. Between us we have vast experience; if you combine our ages, it's astronomical! For me, I played with giants, which was like taking four years of college, four years of postgraduate work and four more years of study added on to that. It was indispensable.''
''So the amount of interplay on the bandstand boils down to experience,'' Mr. Jones continued. ''In the process of playing regularly, we've learned how to edit ourselves and retain some of the things that sound best. And it helps that good standards have such great depth, harmonic and melodic, that you always hear something new in them. Besides, when you approach your work each night as if you're playing for the first time, you allow your imagination to work. You can imagine something that isn't there and make it real, or if something is there that doesn't quite work, you can change it.''
Kenny Barron is playing at the Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at West 11th Street (255-4037). Shows tonight and tomorrow are at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M. and 1 A.M.; on Sunday there is no third show. Mr. Jones will perform tonight and tomorrow night at Bradley's, 70 University Place, at East 11th Street (228-6440). The shows are at 10 P.M., midnight and 2 A.M.; there is a $15 music charge and an $8 minimum.

HEADLINE: U.S. Computer Groups Join In Policy on Japanese Trade

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 4

 BODY:
After more than a year of contentious deliberations, American computer companies and the makers of semiconductors that power computers have resolved their differences on a major issue of trade policy. The result is expected to be continued pressure on Japan to open its $20 billion-a-year market in semiconductors to foreign competition.
Organizations representing the two groups of companies announced a unified position today for developing another five-year semiconductor agreement with Japan that would set new targets for market access. The current five-year pact expires in July. 
The two industries have been divided in the past over the proper approach on the trade issue, with the chip makers pressing for policies raising prices for Japanese chips in this country, and computer companies resisting because of worries about higher costs of imported chips and their customer relationships in Japan.
The divisions have tended to weaken the American Government's negotiating position, which is heavily influenced by the way industries react on specific issues.
The current five-year pact calls on Japan to give foreigners at least a 20 percent share in its market and to stop ''dumping'' chips below fair market value in the United States.
The foreign market share in Japan, while still not near the 20 percent goal, has risen from 8.6 percent of a $12 billion market in 1986 to 13.3 percent of a $20 billion market this year, representing for American chip makers $1 billion a year more than they would have had without the pact.
''It's a much more positive environment than it was five years ago,'' said Wilfred J. Corrigan, chairman and chief executive of the LSI Logic Corporation and chairman of the Semiconductor Industry Assocation.
Representatives of the semiconductor group, made up of 34 chip producers, and the Computer Systems Policy Project, a newly formed group of chief executives of 11 of the biggest computer manufacturers, said they do not expect 20 percent to be achieved by the expiration date of the current agreement. 1992 Deadline In the joint position just adopted, they agreed to give Japan until the end of 1992 to reach the 20 percent and then to negotiate with Japan on another ''quantifiable indicator of progress'' to be attained by 1996.
The executives maintained that if the Japanese market had the same degree of openness as other markets of the world where they operate, the American penetration would be in the 35 to 40 percent range.
Mr. Corrigan said a new target should be ''something in excess of 20 percent, but less than 35 percent.''
Shotaro Yachi, economic counselor at the Japanese Embassy, commented that his Government had ''taken note'' of the position of the two industries, but had made no decisions on the issue.
Officials from both Government and industry in Tokyo have maintained in the past that there is no need for a new pact and have expressed particularly strong reservations against any new targets for market access.
 
U.S. Position
L. W. Koengeter, an aide to the United States trade representative, Carla A. Hills, said the Government would ''give careful consideration to the recommendations.''
As a concession both to Japan and to the computer companies, there was agreement under the unified stand announced today to drop a procedure in which the Commerce Department, through the quarterly collection of cost or price data, in effect, maintains floor prices for imported chips from individual Japanese companies.
The so-called Foreign Market Value calculations would no longer be made by the department. But in the case of electronic programmable read-only memories and dynamic random access memories, Japanese companies would maintain the data and make it available to the Commerce Department on an expedited basis in the case of a formal dumping action.
 
Sanctions Under Reagan
For failing to comply with the present chips pact, the Reagan Administration in 1987 put $300 million of sanctions on a variety of Japanese electronics shipments to this country. It was the first time in the postwar era that Washington had taken a specifically punitive trade action against Japan.
Some, but not all, of that retaliation has been lifted. Today, $165 million of products, including laptop computers and power handtools, still enter with the 100 percent duties ordered under the retaliation.

HEADLINE: Price of Oil Eases by 39/ In Slow Day

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Oil prices eased back yesterday, reflecting what traders called a temporary respite from the wild swings on the futures market.
''There's a definite feel of being in the eye of a hurricane,'' said Peter Beutel, an oil analyst with the Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J.
Crude for November delivery fell 39 cents, to $36.93 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The November gasoline contract fell 2.28 cents, to 90.86 cents a gallon, while wholesale home heating oil rose 0.51 cent, to 99.92 cents a gallon. $3 Gain on Wednesday Later contract months were lower for crude, mostly lower for gasoline and higher for heating oil.
The lackluster trading followed drops in crude prices totaling more than $5 a barrel early in the week and a rally of more than $3 barrel on Wednesday.
Traders said they were holding off during yesterday's session in anticipation of an Iraqi address in the United Nations, which was scheduled for after the close of futures trading yesterday.
Oil's sharp decline early in the week seemed to strip away the ''war premium'' that had elevated crude futures to new heights as speculators bet that hostilities in the Persian Gulf would lead to supply shortages. Yesterday's trading failed to sustain the rally from Wednesday, making buyers reluctant to get into the uncertain market.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
U.S. Deficit Plan Appears Credible

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THE long struggle to cut the budget deficit continues, as the deal struck by White House and Congressional negotiators in the relative seclusion of Andrews Air Force Base failed its first test in the House yesterday. The compromise was opposed by many conservative Republicans, angry with President Bush for abandoning his ''no new taxes'' campaign pledge, and by many liberal Democrats, rejecting the plea of their party leaders to accept a deal that would impose greater burdens on the poor and middle class than on the rich. In an effort to save the deal, President Bush took to the air to appeal over the heads of his Congressional opponents to the electorate directly, warning that there would be ''economic chaos if we fail to reduce the deficit.''
But how credible a solution is this particular budget package? According to the Administration's billing, it would cut the deficit for fiscal year 1991, now estimated to reach $293.7 billion, by $41 billion and cut the cumulative deficits over the next five years by $500 billion. 
These numbers look optimistic but are still fairly credible. For one, the estimated $41 billion cut in the fiscal year 1991, which began Monday, does not include the Middle East mobilization, which by Congressional estimates, will cost about $5 billion, provided that there is no outbreak of hostilities that could add many billions more.
For another, the budget pact assumes the Internal Revenue Service will collect $3 billion more from greater taxpayer compliance - an assumption that looks unrealistic to many on the Hill. In fact, the budget cuts for 1991 are more likely to be closer to $30 billion, rather than $41 billion. This would yield a 1991 deficit of $265 billion, even granting the Administration's economic assumption that real gross national product will grow 1.3 percent from the fourth quarter 1990 to fourth quarter 1991, which implies either no recession or a brief and moderate one.
However, for the five years through 1995, the estimated budget deficit reduction is less dependent on the economic assumptions made by the Administration. After the slow growth forecast for next year, the Office of Management and Budget projects strong growth for the following four years: 3.8 percent in 1992, 4.1 percent in 1993, 3.7 percent in 1994 and 3.5 percent in 1995. A less vigorous rate of growth would cause some increase in the deficit, but most of the projected cuts in the deficit would come, not from rosy economic assumptions or from ''smoke and mirrors'' but from real cuts in Medicare and military expenditures and from higher taxes on gasoline, beer, tobacco, airline tickets, corporate interest deductions and an array of other charges. The estimate of $500 billion in deficit reduction (even after allowing for tax breaks) looks reasonable, though that estimate could be as much as $100 billion too high.
What would the consequences of failing to cut the deficit by some such amount be? No one can be certain, but immediately there would probably be a severe market reaction. The market rose on hopes that the deficit plan would go through, dropped on anxieties that it would not.
And public worries about the economic outlook would deepen. Recent political polls show that a growing majority of the public believes that politicians are pursuing their own interests and those of the special interests, not the public interest.
Further, a failure to act on the deficit would make it far more difficult for the Federal Reserve to relax monetary policy, as the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, has made clear, lest fears of inflation rise, and with them interest rates. Anxieties about a deep recession would stanch or reverse the flow of foreign capital to the United States, pushing rates still higher and cutting into investment.
If this attempt at budget compromise collapses, Congress would be confronted immediately with unpleasant alternatives: to let the budget cuts under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law take effect, or to declare a national emergency, suspend Gramm-Rudman and let the deficit soar.
Sustained deficits of the projected magnitudes would put a heavy drain on savings, keep interest rates high, curb investment and retard the nation's economic growth. It would stifle the flow of revenues to the Treasury both at home and abroad and hamper the ability to finance solutions to problems or crises.
The present deficit-cutting package is disliked by many people, in Congress and outside it. Yet the odds still favor passage of a plan by Congress, not only because the President and Congressional leaders have signed on to it, but, more fundamentally, because a new force is at work: public disgust with incumbent politicians for failing to come to grips with the chronic deficit and recognition of the danger that if they do not act the nation's economy and its people will suffer.
A better combination of elements may be needed to resolve the conflicts, but the deficit must be cut as much as the White House-Congressional compromise pact requires.

HEADLINE: Program Trades Lift Stocks; Dow Up 27.47

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks rallied yesterday on wave after wave of computerized program trading, with increasingly weary traders tagging the day as just another rally in what is clearly a bear market.
After two inconclusive days that dragged the Dow Jones industrial average down 26.48 points, the blue-chip index climbed an equally inconclusive 27.47 points, to 2,516.83, making it about even since Monday.
Moreover, yesterday's gains did not extend across the market.
''The better-acting blue chips,'' said Peter G. Grennan, head of stock index futures trading at Shearson, Lehman Brothers, ''is camouflaging the selling seeping through the broad list of stocks. It's not very encouraging; the broad list continues to recede under quiet, consistent, steady pressure.'' While the Dow industrials rose slightly more than 1 percent, the S.& P. 500 rose by less than half that, and the New York Stock Exchange index by a third. And smaller stocks fell, as shown by the Nasdaq composite and the American Stock Exchange's market value index. 
''We're in a bear market,'' said Robert H. Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers. ''And one of its characteristics is periods of dull drifting and we just have to get used to it.
''If there's no dramatic new development, the market just drifts and tends to wear you down; you can't expect big action every day.''
Michael Metz, chief market analyst for the investment firm of Oppenheimer & Company, said, ''There's concern over the fate of the budget compromise, whether it will be approved by Congress or, if not, do we try for a new package or do we get automatic spending cuts and government employee cuts. ''The trillion-dollar question is, What does the Fed do in either event?''
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, endorsed the budget plan Wednesday for the first time and implied that it would reduce interest rates - a step Wall Street has said repeatedly would ignite the stock market. What the Fed decides to do, consequently, is what Wall Street is waiting to hear.
Explaining yesterday's upturn in the Dow, Mr. Metz said that ''program traders really called the tune.''
Critics argue that program traders help drive up the market when the Dow advances and contribute to its decline when it drops. Its supporters argue that the practice often provides liquidity and, consequently, helps the market. Birinyi Associates, which monitors such activity, said eight waves of program buying drove the market up 37 points.
Describing the process, Mr. Metz said that ''players in the futures market'' - typically in the Standard & Poor's 500 futures traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange - ''have determined price movements.'' He added: ''You push futures down and stocks follow; then you reverse course and push futures up and stocks go up in tandem. ''In thin markets where investors have no conviction at all, it's very easy to spark rather wild price gyrations. That was the story today.''
Suggesting the low level of investor interest in the market, trading activity rose only slightly, to 145.4 million shares, from 135.5 million Thursday.
Price declines just barely outnumbered advances, 780 to 731, and only 4 stocks reached new highs while 139 set new lows for the year.
Among those touching new lows was Tenneco, a gas pipeline company with interests ranging from farm equipment to chemicals. Until last week Prudential-Bache said it ''offers excellent value.'' Yesterday, David N. Fleischer, its natural gas analyst, said ''it still does,'' and that he still recommends it ''on a long-term basis.''
But he cut his earnings estimate after getting new data on Tenneco's farm equipment and chemical business. After nervous investors sold, Tenneco fell to a new low of 44 3/4, with 1.8 million shares changing hands, before ending at 45 1/4, down 4 3/4.
Ingersoll-Rand, the heavy machinery producer, fell to a new low of 33, closing at 33 1/4, down 5 7/8, after saying its third-quarter profits would not meet expectations.
 
Tokyo Stocks Rise
TOKYO, Friday, Oct. 5 (Reuters)-On the Tokyo Stock Exchange today, the Nikkei index of 225 stocks gained 549.46 points, or 2.47 percent, to 22,827.65.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Notes and Bonds Climb

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury notes and bonds moved higher and interest rates dropped in nervous trading yesterday, as dealers kept a close eye on a test vote of the Federal budget package in the House of Representatives.
''The market is preoccupied with the goings on in Washington, but it continues to grind higher because its technical condition is still very good,'' said John P. Costas, director of taxable fixed-income investments at the First Boston Corporation. ''We are all very anxious to see how the vote turns out.''
President Bush has pledged to veto any legislation aimed at maintaining spending for all but essential services and the military beyond today, a vow market participants assume will be kept. 
''The market is beginning to think that Congress is beginning to see the stark reality of what would happen if the budget proposal doesn't pass, and that realization may make them pass it,'' said Robert Chandross, chief economist at Lloyds Bank.
''If nothing gets done, the situation would be horrendous. It would mean that Congress would come back on Tuesday and not have anybody working for them.''
 
Columbus Day Holiday
The Columbus Day holiday falls on Monday, and yesterday the Public Securities Association, an industry trade group, recommended that trading in Government securities be closed in observance of the holiday.
In addition to anticipating a positive outcome to the budget vote, traders also bought securities on the expectation that September employment data to be released this morning will show a further deterioration in labor market conditions.
In advance of the figures, most economists are projecting that non-farm payroll employment expanded by 60,000 last month, excluding Census workers. An increase in the unemployment rate is also anticipated.
''At some point soon the unemployment rate is going to become a very sensitive issue'' for both Congress and the Federal Reserve Board, one government bond trader said. ''Friday may be the day.''
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 3/4 percent 30-year bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 99 5/8 late yesterday, up 7/8 point, to yield 8.78 percent, compared with 8.85 percent late Wednesday.
 
Treasury Note Issues
Among Treasury note issues, the 8 3/4 percent 10-year notes were offered at 100 22/32 in late trading, up 14/32, to yield 8.64 percent. And the 8 1/8 percent two-year notes were offered at 100 17/32, up 1/8 point, to yield 7.83 percent. Short-term Treasury bill rates fell. By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.11 percent, down four basis points, or hundredths of a point. Six-month bill rates fell by five basis points, to a late offered rate of 7.12 percent. And one-year bill rates fell by five basis points, to 7.03 percent.
In the corporate bond market, the Chesapeake Corporation offered $55 million of 10-year notes through an underwriting group led by Salomon Brothers.
The 10 3/8 percent notes, which mature Oct. 1, 2000, were priced at $99.718 to yield 10.42 percent, 1.75 percentage points over the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent 10-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities, which are noncallable for life, are rated Baa-3 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB-minus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Activity in the secondary markets for investment-grade corporate bonds and tax-exempt municipal securities was very light, according to participants.
Prices of most corporate bonds were unchanged on the day, traders said, while prices of actively quoted municipal issues rose by about 1/2 point.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that two of the three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended Sept. 29. The third, broadest measure, M-3, fell by $7.5 billion.
The report had no impact on prices in the credit markets.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Falls as Gold Dips In U.S. After Rise Abroad

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar dropped against all leading foreign currencies yesterday amid selling on the widespread assumption that United States interest rates will fall in the near future.
Gold prices eased in United States trading after climbing on precious metals markets abroad.
The heaviest dollar selling in the United States occurred when activity began. Domestic foreign exchange dealers took their cue from Europe, where the dollar had earlier touched a new postwar low against the German mark. 
John McCarthy, chief dealer at the Amsterdam Rotterdam Bank's office in New York, said the strong dollar sales subsided as the session progressed. But the dollar still closed lower than the day before.
Dealers were given an incentive to dump dollars by comments of Alan Greenspan, Federal Reserve chairman, to a Congressional committee on Wednesday.
Speaking in support of the fiscal year 1991 budget proposal, Mr. Greenspan indicated the central bank would pursue a more generous credit policy if Congress enacted the compromise on cutting the federal deficit.
A looser Fed policy would lead to lower United States interest rates, which would tend to curb dollar demand by making returns on dollar-denominated investments less rewarding than foreign alternatives.
 
September Employment Data
The report due today on the September employment situation is expected to reconfirm the economy's weakness and possibly weigh down the dollar further. A downturn in the economy in itself could cause interest rates to fall - even if the Fed does not give them a nudge.
In Europe, the dollar hit a low for the post-World War II era of 1.5310 against the mark in early afternoon trading, breaking the previous postwar low of 1.5385 reached on Aug. 27. It traded at 1.5340 marks late in New York, down from 1.5420 late Wednesday.
The dollar also weakened against the Japanese yen. In Tokyo, it fell 0.75 yen, to a closing 135.90 yen. Later in London, it fell to 134.00 yen. The dollar closed at 133.83 yen in New York vs. 136.04 yen Wednesday.
The British pound rose to $1.9115, from $1.8990 late Wednesday. In New York, it cost $1.9145 to buy a pound, more expensive than Wednesday's $1.9025.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's late quotes, included: 1.2800 Swiss francs, down from 1.2835; 5.1375 French francs, down from 5.1660; 1,149.00 Italian lire, down from 1,155.75, and 1.14865 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1516.
Gold prices were mixed. On New York's Commodity Exchange, bullion for October delivery settled at $392.30 a troy ounce, down $1.60 from Wednesday. Later, the Republic National Bank quoted a bid for gold of $393.20 an ounce, 75 cents below Wednesday's 4 P.M. bid.
Silver prices were also mixed. On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery settled at $4.668 a troy ounce, down from $4.690 on Wednesday. In London, silver rose to a late bid of $4.71 a troy ounce, from $4.70 bid late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Drexel Judge Steps Down

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The Federal judge overseeing the Drexel Burnham Lambert Group Inc. bankruptcy withdrew from the case yesterday because he is considering a job at a law firm that has represented a Drexel creditor.
Judge Howard C. Buschman 3d said he was stepping down from the bench after seven years to return to better-paying private practice. 
Lawyers for Drexel and creditors said the departure would delay proceedings while his replacement becomes familiar with the largest collapse of a financial firm in Wall Street history.
 
Federal Bankruptcy Judge
Frank Conrad, who sits in Rutland, Vt., was named to take over the Drexel proceedings.
Lawyers said Judge Conrad had indicated he would spend about two weeks a month in New York on the case.

HEADLINE: Jobless Rate Up Again, Adding to Recession Fears

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
In a report that left few analysts doubting that recession was either imminent or already under way, Labor Department figures showed today that the number of jobs shrank in September while the unemployment rate rose for the third straight month, to 5.7 percent.
Although the increase in the jobless rate was just one-tenth of a percentage point, there have not been three consecutive monthly advances since the 1981-1982 recession, and analysts expressed general agreement that today's report, the first comprehensive gauge of economic performance last month, had many earmarks of a recession.
''We're probably now in one,'' commented David H. Resler, chief economist for Nomura Securities International in New York. ''There is absolutely no area to be optimistic about.'' 
Jobs in manufacturing, for example, tumbled by a further 66,000 in September, the second biggest loss since factory employment began to fall in early 1989. A total of 520,000 such jobs have disappeared since then, 115,000 of them in the last two months.
Even more disheartening, analysts said, is the fact that in recent months employment in the much larger service sector, which had previously more than offset declines in factory and other goods-producing jobs, has stopped rising.
This, warned the Commissioner of Labor Statistics, Dr. Janet L. Norwood, requires close scrutiny. She told the Joint Economic Committee of Congress today that even if the economy was not yet in recession ''there's great risk, very clearly'' of such a downturn. Afterward she characterized the labor market as ''crummy.''
Among the other pervasive signs of economic stagnation were a rare decline, amounting to 449,000, in the number of civilians employed during the third quarter and a September drop in the percentage of industries adding to payrolls, to 44 percent. This was the lowest percentage since December 1982.
In addition, the number of workers on layoff climbed to 1,127,000 in September, from 973,000 in August, and the ranks of part-time workers who would have preferred to work full time climbed to 5,365,000, from 5,036,000.
 
Some Favorable Indicators
Only a few indicators were not unfavorable: a modest decline in the third quarter in the number of discouraged workers - those who have given up looking for jobs in the belief they would not find any - and a small increase in the index of total weekly hours worked in the nonfarm private sector.
The length of the average work week rose by 12 minutes, to 34.7 hours, suggesting that employers were making heavy use of existing personnel and were reluctant to add workers in such a dim economic climate.
The department also reported that average hourly earnings rose five-tenths of 1 percent, to $10.13. Normally, economists would have considered this unsettlingly high, but they said the average was no doubt pushed up by the layoff of relatively newer workers, who are generally paid less.
According to the department's survey of business payrolls, the number of jobs fell 101,000 last month - 84,000 goods-producing jobs and 17,000 in services. If 40,000 departing temporary census workers are excluded, the decline was 61,000. The department also revised its figure downward for August, to a gain of 37,000, not counting census workers.
 
Growth in Health Care
The industries of transportation equipment, electronic equipment and industrial machinery each lost almost 15,000 jobs last month and significant losses also occurred in fabricated metals, furniture and the stone, clay and glass category. Construction jobs fell 20,000, bringing losses over the latest four months to more than 100,000, the report showed.
The rise in oil prices has not yet produced any significant increase in the energy sector, but there were hefty gains of 45,000 in health care and 25,000 in local government.
Health jobs have accounted for nearly 40 percent of total job growth this year. The gain in local government last month mostly reflected rising school enrollment, which has raised demand for workers like school-bus drivers as well as teachers.
The department also conducts a survey of households separate from the payroll survey, and it posted an increase of 240,000 in the number of civilians employed. When combined with a 307,000 increase in the labor force, this meant the ranks of the jobless grew by 67,000 and the unemployment rate rose one-tenth of a point for the second straight month. In July, the jobless rate jumped three-tenths of a point, to 5.5 percent.
 
Weakness Is Seen
The two surveys usually move together in the longer term, but the household survey showed far slower job growth over the past year than the payroll survey: 517,000 compared with 1,688,000. One economist, H. Erich Heinemann of Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company in New York regarded this as confirmation of a skidding economy.
He said that the payroll survey, which takes account of workers with multiple jobs and is generally considered a better economic gauge, had historically overstated job growth at economic peaks and that a recent narrowing of the gap between it and the household survey meant economic weakness.
The jobless rate for Hispanic workers rose nine-tenths of a point, to 8.7 percent last month, and the rate for blacks rose three-tenths of a point, to 12.1 percent.
The rate for all teen-agers fell 1.2 points, to 15.5 percent. The rates for black teen-agers fell by about 8 points each, to 30.6 percent for men and 26.9 percent for women.
Among the 11 most populous states, the biggest rise was seven-tenths of a point, to 7.2 percent, in Illinois, while the biggest declines were by that same amount for Michigan, to 7.2 percent, and for Florida, to 6 percent. The jobless rate rose five-tenths of a point in New York and four-tenths of a point in New Jersey, to 5.5 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively.
In all, 119,499,000 Americans held jobs last month - 117,898,000 civilians and 1,601,000 domestically stationed military personnel.
The overall jobless rate, including the military, rose one-tenth of a point last month to 5.6 percent.

BUSH REJECTS STOPGAP BILL AFTER BUDGET PACT DEFEAT; FEDERAL SHUTDOWN BEGINS
Congress is Pushed

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Saturday, Oct. 6

 BODY:
Congress approved stopgap spending legislation last night to buy time to repair the wreckage left when the House rejected the budget compromise. But the White House said President Bush, in an attempt to force Congress to pass a budget, would not sign the stopgap bill.
Without a new temporary appropriations law, the Government's authority to spend money for regular operations lapsed at midnight Friday. The White House was banking on the three-day holiday weekend to minimize the effect of a Government shutdown, while increasing the pressure on Congress. 
 
Fitzwater's Statement
''The President will not be party to a process that will once again postpone this responsibility for a few more days,'' said the President's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater.
Mr. Fitzwater said ''essential services of the Government'' would be maintained, including the air traffic control system and military operations in the Persian Gulf. But at midnight many Government agencies started taking the initial steps to shut down their services. For example, the Department of Agriculture said only a handful of its 100,000 employees would be expected to report for work beginning today.
After Mr. Fitzwater spoke, Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Democratic leader, responded angrily. He said the President was responsible for the failure of the budget deal because of his ''insistence on support for his positions.'' $500 Billion Cut in Deficit The showdown over the continuing operation of Government followed the House's rejection early Friday, by a 254-to-179 vote, of a budget compromise that had been negotiated over four weeks by the leaders of Congress and the Administration's chief economic policymakers. [A roll-call of the vote is on Page 10.] The deal was supposed to reduce the deficit by $40 billion this year, and $500 billion over five years through cuts in Medicare, higher gasoline tax and other unpopular steps.
It was the worst domestic policy defeat of the Bush Presidency. The President's popularity rating has been the highest of any President in history, and until now he more or less had his way with Congress.
Although the agreement reached last weekend was rejected Friday morning, the dominant view in the Capitol and around the city is that a new budget measure will rise quickly from the ashes. How that will happen, however, was uncertain.
According to one report, Richard G. Darman and John H. Sununu, the White House budget director and chief of staff, respectively, told House Republican leaders that they hoped to influence the shape of whatever budget package the House contemplated and were told, in effect, that their day was over.
''I'm not sure about the President, but the people around him weren't in touch with reality,'' said Representative Silvio O. Conte of Massachusetts, a senior Republican.
 
Tense Cabinet Meeting
Tension in the Administration was evident at an unusually animated meeting Friday afternoon of Mr. Bush's Cabinet. Several officials who had served in the House expressed concern that Mr. Sununu and Mr. Darman were too heavy-handed in their relations with lawmakers, Administration officials said.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, Veterans Affairs Secretary Edward Derwinsky, Interior Secretary Manuel Lujan Jr. and Henson Moore, the Deputy Energy Secretary, suggested that Mr. Bush's aides were too bent on exacting revenge on Newt Gingrich, the rebellious House Republican Whip, and too closely tied to the eight-man budget negotiating process that sparked the Capitol Hill revolt.
''The thrust of the debate was, let's figure out how to get a package that we can get good Republican support for and try to get Democratic support afterward, but mainly rally the party again,'' an official said.
Mr. Sununu argued that Mr. Bush should simply not sign the stopgap spending measure. Under the Constitution, the President can block legislation for 10 days by withholding his signature, and Congress has no recourse.
 
Push From Quayle
Vice President Dan Quayle, Treasury Nicholas F. Brady and Mr. Moore became embroiled in a debate with Mr. Sununu, saying if Mr. Bush vetoed the stopgap measure his veto would be sustained, officials said.
''Even if we couldn't, they argued that it's better to be aggressive and active,'' an official said. ''But they wanted to be sure that the President got a message that they were afraid was not being relayed by the negotiating team, and that is that Republicans want to come home and we should give them some reason to do so. They were concerned that Sununu was so angry at Republicans that he was not seeing an opportunity.''
On Capitol Hill, some lawmakers thought the President was bluffing and would not allow real disruption to the Government. The three-day weekend marking Columbus Day would allow the President to provoke a crisis without having it hit the public and Government employees with its full impact. But parts of the public could feel the impact at once: many of Washington's monuments and museums would be closed to visitors starting today, as would the Statue of Liberty and other tourist sites.
As for whether Mr. Bush was bluffing or not, Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the influential chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said, ''Oh heck, he said he wasn't going to raise taxes either.''
But Representative Gerald B. H. Solomon, Republican of upstate New York, declared: ''The ax falls at midnight tonight. Make no mistake about it.''
Within hours of the stunning defeat of the budget compromise shortly after 1 A.M. Friday, Congressional leaders and White House officials began to talk about what steps to take next. Mr. Sununu and Mr. Darman were in the office of the Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, at 11 A.M.
Even before that, Mr. Foley talked on the telephone with President Bush. ''We agreed that we had to go forward with the process,'' Mr. Foley reported afterward.
The budget compromise was brought down early Friday by a coalition of conservative Republican and liberal Democratic backbenchers.
After many vote switches at the last minute, 108 Democrats and 71 Republicans voted for the measure; 149 Democrats and 105 Republicans voted against it.
While it was a striking defeat for the President and Congressional leaders, the vote was not conclusive.
The financial markets apparently also felt that a budget deal was not dead. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed essentially unchanged.
The Democrats on the House Budget Committee met Friday afternoon and decided to offer a budget with targets for spending categories and revenues similar to the one rejected in the morning. But cuts in Medicare would be limited, military spending would be lower and other modest changes would be made. The big difference would be that within broad categories, the details of how money would be raised and spent could be changed by Congressional committees over the next two weeks.
That would mean, for example, that the Ways and Means Committee could offer a tax package that raised the same amount of money as the compromise package, but the types of taxation could be significantly different.
Lawmakers said the new budget resolution setting the targets could be voted on as early as this weekend.
The House approved the temporary legislation by a vote of 300 to 113. The Senate passed it by unanimous consent.

HEADLINE: FOREIGN AFFAIRS;
Japan's Fiery Pussycat

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
Face to face, he seems more of a pussycat than a fire-breathing dragon. Shintaro Ishihara, the man who wrote ''The Japan That Can Say No,'' is angry now that the U.S. sent some marines to the Persian Gulf from a Japanese base without asking permission. He claims it's a violation of the security treaty, which is false.
But what if the U.S. had consulted? ''I would say yes, of course,'' he said with a smile. He denies he ever advocated breaking the U.S.-Japan alliance, which is certainly the impression left by the unauthorized translation of his book circulated in America. ''My best non-seller,'' he cracks, adding that his new, commercial version will be published in New York late this year. 
What he wants, he says, is to change the treaty to provide ''perfect equality.'' Instead of repeating anti-American attacks, with racist undertones, which dot his book, he argues that ''Japan and America together can create a new civilization.''
But then the claws begin to show. Mr. Ishihara uses a baseball metaphor. Japan and America should form a ''battery, catcher and pitcher. We are strong, we can win. First the Pacific League, and then the World League. The time of the Pacific is coming.''
Mr. Ishihara has made himself a star of the strident, nationalistic, assertive streak in Japanese opinion. The rest of the Establishment assures, with good evidence from polls and elections, that it's only marginal. But his book sold a million copies here. Japan is still obsessively sensitive to any American criticism, and it does give people a lift to hear someone slap back.
He's tall, well-dressed, good on the stump and he can be witty, so he's become a ''personality.'' He first gained recognition as a somewhat shocking novelist, ''Japan's male version of Francoise Sagan,'' said an official. He can be playful. Asked his age, he coyly solicited a guess, appreciated the underestimate with a modest smile, and admitted to 57. ''You can read about me in Playboy,'' he said. ''I love Playboy.'' There is a mounting nationalism here, as Japanese become aware that their diligence and discipline have made them an economic giant with the world's second-largest G.N.P. Thoughtful people worry about it. They feel the country has reached a kind of crossroads. It doesn't want to go back to isolation, with all the deprivation that would mean, but will it go forward as a constructive, responsible partner or as a petulant troublemaker, on the prowl?
The issue hasn't really been joined. It's discussed only obliquely in public, revolving on immediate, essentially symbolic questions because it feels unseemly, risky, to address the big underlying notion of responsibility. Should members of the armed forces be sent to the gulf to show solidarity? If so, can they wear uniforms? Can they wear sidearms? What if they get in a danger zone?
Even Mr. Ishihara, who argues that Japan should provide for its own defense and follow its own strategic interests, says participation should be limited to ''sending navy ships to protect Japanese tankers.'' That doesn't extend to enforcing the embargo, and it's beside the point of the gulf crisis.
He is fuzzy, sometimes wrong, on military facts and problems. That doesn't bother him, because he's a polemicist and the public is poorly informed on both the current situation and the global political stakes.
A common joke in Japan is that ''If you want to keep out of danger, join the armed forces.'' He knows there's a deep, broad sense that Japan must stay out of conflict, and that it contributes enough for peace if it stays out of other people's quarrels.
But there is also an intense disdain for the leadership, in a society that has a rooted habit of expecting guidance from authority. Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu gets little respect. Criticism is harsh even from leading figures in his own Liberal Democratic Party.
Former Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa called him an ''ersatz Prime Minister.'' Former Prime Minister Yashuhiro Nakasone (he played ''Yasu'' to President Reagan's ''Ron'' and says ''We were both commander-type people'') deplores the Government's amateurish incapacity to handle crisis.
Once again there is much talk about political reform, but not much more prospect for achieving it despite understanding that Japan is being propelled into a new position in a changed world. In this atmosphere, people like Mr. Ishihara who can sound simple, rousing themes and articulate grievances have an audience. But he isn't that much of a dragon. We can work with Japan.

HEADLINE: How to Pass the Budget

BYLINE: By Don J. Pease; Don J. Pease, Democrat of Ohio, suggested a tax compromise that helped produce last Sunday's budget summit agreement.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
There is no tidy way for President Bush and Congressional leaders to recover from the stunning bipartisan defeat of the budget package Thursday night. Like people in a small-town that has just been wiped off the map by a tornado, they just have to dig themselves out and start thinking about the first step.
Unfortunately, there are no good first steps; none that carry any assurances of success. As far as I can see - and this is a measure of the desperate straits we now find ourselves in - the best the leadership can do is to keep offering the same budget resolution that failed Thursday. Just keep offering it, day after day, until it passes. 
None of the other commonly suggested strategies seems feasible.
One option, which some Democrats have talked about bravely since the budget agreement was announced last Sunday, is to write a genuinely Democratic budget. It would be more progressive (a 35 percent top marginal rate on income taxes). It would cut Medicare by only $30 billion, compared with $60 billion in the original package. It would not, as the summit agreement would, increase to two weeks the waiting period for unemployment compensation. It would make smaller cuts in farm programs and larger cuts in the military.
This approach would be healthy for our political system. The majority in Congress would act like a majority for once, and Americans would have a clear choice of philosophies and policies. The people might see Congress as a more effective institution and the Democrats as less feckless.
But this approach is also the most unrealistic. If the Democrats in the House and Senate were effective, cohesive majorities, the cumbersome budget summit process would not have been needed in the first place. In truth, chances of passing a ''genuine Democratic'' budget were slim in the House and near zero in the Senate.
As a somewhat more realistic option, some have suggested that the President reconvene the budget summit to approve limited, specific changes that address the most common objections to the original agreement: regressive taxes and too large a hit on Medicare.
But reconvening the summit group would bring together the same crew that wrangled fruitlessly for the last four months. Quick action would be unlikely.
A third option would be to convene a new budget summit without the Administration's participation. By many accounts, the hard-line positions of the White House Chief of Staff, John Sununu, were an impediment in the original negotiations. The Congressional participants have known and negotiated with each other for years. They know the art of compromise; they know the ''hot buttons'' of their colleagues; they all put ideology second to practicality.
The problem with this approach is simple: It would take weeks to achieve, even if President Bush were willing to deal himself out of the picture, which is highly unlikely.
The best, fastest, most feasible approach is to bring up the same budget agreement that was rejected so resoundingly Thursday night and keep bringing it up until it passes.
President Bush can do two things to enhance his chances for success. First, he can create a crisis situation by refusing to sign a short-term appropriations bill. This would either threaten to close down the Federal Government or trigger across-the-board, Gramm-Rudman budget cuts.
A Government shut down would get the attention of Congress and the nation. For once, Congress would have some immediate consequences to weigh against inaction on the budget.
Second, Mr. Bush should define how much flexibility Congress would have to adjust the budget resolution after it had passed. He has to assure nervous members that their worries about Medicare cutbacks and regressive taxes could be addressed even after passage.
Alternatively, President Bush and Congressional leaders could reach informal understandings about ameliorating Medicare cuts, balancing tax burdens and other steps to take the worst pain out of the budget package. For example, raising or eliminating the Medicare insurance wage base would make the whole package more progressive while providing money to temper Medicare cuts.
Moreover, to get the wealthy to share more equally in the tax burden, Congress could enhance the ''Pease plan'' for limiting itemized deductions for those with more than $100,000 in taxable income.
Many of us who voted for the budget agreement Thursday night did so in the belief that there were no realistic, achievable alternatives. There were none and there are none. Opponents were listening either to the ideologists or the special interests.
Now, President Bush needs to underline the crisis we are in, insist on budget votes day after day, and let congressmen and senators hear from those Americans who are neither ideologues nor special pleaders. Just ordinary citizens who expect their elected officials to govern.

HEADLINE: Vocational Schools Train Millions for Life

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Sure We Need Beauticians'' by Robert G. Bottoms, president of DePauw University (Op-Ed, Sept. 17) presents a deeply disturbing view of private postsecondary trade and technical institutions. I share his concern about reductions in Pell grants and the increasing difficulty many people face in paying the rising costs of higher education. But blaming trade school students for the problem is outrageous and arrogant. 
Mr. Bottoms's proposal for segregating aid for students at private career schools into a separate program is little more than educational apartheid. It belittles the education provided by trade and technical schools and demeans the millions of Americans not college educated who make vital and important contributions to our nation. Mr. Bottoms implies that the two million students who annually attend private trade and technical schools are less important than those who choose elite private colleges and universities.
As President Bush said during his 1988 Presidential campaign, ''You don't have to go to college to be a success.'' Nor is college best for everyone. Our economy requires people who build our homes, program our computers, assist our doctors, repair our automobiles, and maintain and serve our offices, schools and hospitals. They greatly determine how well the American family, economy and democracy function.
Only half of our nation's high school graduates go to college, and less than half of those obtain a degree. Yet according to the Department of Labor, 70 percent of the new jobs created by 1995 will require education beyond high school, while only 20 percent will require a college degree.
By making students in private career schools eligible for aid, Congress said all students, including the very poor, should have access to the education that best meets their interests, needs and abilities. Congress realized that people attend a postsecondary institution, whether liberal arts college or trade school, for a better job and greater financial security.
Yes, there have been problems with financial aid at postsecondary institutions. But we should not single out one kind of student or school for blame. We must not compromise the ability of all students to get the assistance they need to pursue the American dream.

HEADLINE: Help Filipinos Hold On

 BODY:
Corazon Aquino has survived still another coup attempt by rebel Philippine soldiers. But survival is just about all her once-promising Government has going for it as she concludes the fifth year of her six- year term. All the same, bequeathing a restored democracy to her successor remains a significant and attainable goal. Washington did right to signal that it would swiftly punish any coup-imposed regime by withholding foreign aid. 
With the cold war now ending in Asia as well as Europe, U.S. relations with the Philippines are being transformed. The big bases at Subic Bay and Clark Field are no longer essential. The Bush Administration is prepared to relocate them if terms can't be agreed on in talks now under way.
Even so, the two countries remain linked in a special relationship, the heritage of a half-century of American colonial rule. And while the Philippines has become less significant militarily, it remains part of the world's fastest-growing economic region. Sadly, policies of both the Marcos and Aquino regimes have caused the Philippines to miss out on the Southeast Asian boom.
Mrs. Aquino's presidency has badly disappointed the hopes she once inspired. It hasn't all been her fault. Military plots, Communist insurgency, inherited debt, natural disasters and now the stiff oil shock have kept her almost continuously off balance. But her damaging failures to deliver on promises of land reform and tariff reduction have been self-inflicted. And the shocking inefficiency of public services has demoralized the public and deterred potential investors.
These failures have provided her many critics with ample grist. But the most powerful of these have been military adventurers or corrupt former cronies of Ferdinand Marcos. What a rude betrayal it would be for the Filipinos who filled the streets with people power in 1986 again to suffer dictatorship, disregard for human rights and corruption. And what a negative message it would give to the aid donors and investors who now represent the country's best hope for growth.
Americans can't rescue the Aquino presidency from its own failings. But Washington does well to deploy its aid leverage in defense of the most important product of people power: Filipinos' right to elect leaders of their own choosing.

Can the Federal Government shut down? Yes, and such a shutdown is exactly what the country faces after the House's dumbfounding vote to reject the deficit reduction compromise. Fiscal 1991 began Monday but the Government is still without a budget, and without authority to spend money.
The paralysis occurs at the start of the three-day Columbus Day weekend, a time of minimal governmental activity. But even if the impasse is resolved quickly, it would traumatize Federal employees. Worse, the simple uncertainties could torment millions of citizens.
That makes it essential for Congress to agree, with all urgency, on a new budget compromise. Many members reviled the old one; but it was better than nothing, and anyone who doubts it now has the grim opportunity to contemplate the consequences of nothing.
Any plausible compromise package needs to address three principles:
Credibility: The overall size of deficit reduction must be comparable to the half-trillion dollars that the rejected compromise would have achieved over five years. And, like the rejected compromise, it should keep next year's hit small enough to protect a fragile economy.
Regressivity: The burden of tax hikes and spending cuts should fall primarily on the non-poor, but under no circumstance should the poor and near-poor bear more burden than under the rejected compromise.
Social services: Cuts in domestic discretionary programs should be no higher than under the rejected compromise.
These ingredients are essential to economic growth; they are essential to social justice.
A glaring defect of the rejected compromise was that it made appallingly small cuts in defense, as though no one had noticed that the cold war was over. A new compromise could be forged by prudently cutting tens of billions more from defense over five years, freeing money to soften the required tax hikes and increases in Medicare premiums. And eliminating the Administration's ineptly drawn investment incentives would free billions more for the same purpose. Lowering taxes and premiums on the middle class and poor could make such a compromise palatable to Democrats and Republicans.
In the best of all budgets, funds freed from defense would be used to invest in children and to rebuild the nation's infrastructure. For the moment, those priorities seem foreclosed. Fighting the budgetary battle for kids and concrete will have to be postponed.
The immediate enemy is Government shutdown chaos. It's not a contrivance for political jockeying. It can brutalize innocent citizens. The country needs a government, which means a budget, which means there are compromises to be made, and fast.

A Tragedy at a Plant As Lived By Strikers

BYLINE: By JANET MASLIN

 BODY:
Barbara Kopple is well remembered as the director of ''Harlan County, U.S.A.,'' her outstandingly fine and troubling 1977 documentary about a strike by coal miners against a power company in eastern Kentucky. Now, in her account of another walkout, this time by factory workers at the George A. Hormel Company meatpacking plant in Austin, Minn., Ms. Kopple has found and illustrated another American tragedy.
''American Dream,'' her devastating look at this strike and the profound damage it left behind, begins in the mid-1980's with a matter-of-fact look at meat processors at work. It's a dirty job, but in the town of Austin it was then also a good one, paying $10.69 an hour and providing steady employment. ''American Dream'' is about what happened to Austin when Hormel tried to roll back those wages to $8.25. Unlike ''Harlan County, U.S.A.,'' which observed a more violent struggle that was simpler, ''American Dream'' is no David and Goliath story. The David here, local P-9 of the meatpacking division of the United Food and Commercial Workers' Union, pits itself against two Goliaths and embarks on a suicide mission. Rebelling against both Hormel and its own international parent union, local P-9 resisted the idea of lower wages. ''The unions are getting their teeth kicked in,'' said Jim Guyette, the local's president. He was right. 
''American Dream'' begins with Ronald Reagan, since it sees his economic policies as the root cause of Austin's troubles. Early in the film, workers protesting the wage cut visit the home of a Hormel executive and are asked (by a wife speaking to them through a screen door), ''Why do you stay if you aren't happy?'' Corporate spokesmen cite ''the welfare of the long-term future of the company'' to counter the workers' demands. One of Local P-9's first moves, in response to such stonewalling, is to hire Ray Rogers of Corporate Campaign Inc., a one-man army whose specialty is turning media attention into a secret weapon.
Although Mr. Rogers is a colorful figure and his tactics have an element of mischief, ''American Dream'' is no ''Roger and Me.'' Ms. Kopple spends much less time questioning the behavior of Hormel's management than she does studying the terrible predicament in which it places the workers. As the protest moves inevitably toward a strike, Local P-9 meets opposition from employers, its parent union and even inside its own ranks. ''That'll destroy us quicker than anything will,'' one union member says. Still, the feeling within P-9 is initially one of euphoria and of blind faith in the power of concerted effort. There is even dancing at the union hall. And when P-9 officials put their demands in writing they excitedly envision a whole new arrangement. This enrages the more seasoned, more compromise-minded labor negotiators of the international. ''You don't give the company the opportunity to dismantle the whole contract just because you rewrote it,'' one of them says bitterly.
Ms. Kopple's camera observes all of this at very close range, at the kitchen tables of those who are most painfully affected. When the prospect of a strike becomes inevitable, she films two brothers who are on different sides of the dispute and agree they will not speak again if one crosses the picket line. Once the strike is under way, with nonunion workers earning $10.25 an hour, she captures the misery and bewilderment of those on the picket line. ''You see all these people you talk to every day, and it makes you want to cry,'' one picket says. ''This place is not big enough for anyone to hide for very long,'' says someone else. Proud, reserved men begin to cry when talking of no longer being able to provide for their families.
Above all else, ''American Dream'' is about the destruction of Austin's ideals. By the end of the film, the limb onto which P-9 has ventured has been sawed off. P-9's parent union has ousted the renegades and made its own settlement with Hormel, making no allowance for restoring jobs to those who honored the picket lines and agreeing on a $10.25 wage. It didn't take long, Ms. Kopple notes in a closing title, for Hormel to sublease the factory to a company that paid $6.50 an hour.
What hits home most powerfully in ''American Dream'' is the film maker's sense of how deep this damage ultimately runs. When the defeated strikers try to claim victory (Ray Rogers, the charismatic labor organizer, tries to say that these events ''cannot be considered anything but positive''), or when a woman tearfully packing her belongings insists, ''We're not leaving, we're just taking our fight elsewhere,'' it's clear how crushing the full weight of this debacle will be.
Ms. Kopple's stirring, forthright film captures an American town, the strength of its traditions and the deep and permanent ways in which those traditions can be destroyed. Her work is as important as it is good.
''American Dream'' will be shown at 6:30 tonight as part of the New York Film Festival.

HEADLINE: Senator Staging Startling Comeback in Bid for Re-election in Rhode Island

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARWICK, R.I., Oct. 3

 BODY:
It was not hard, six months ago, to compile a long list of reasons that Senator Claiborne Pell, the shy, aristocratic 71-year-old Democrat from Rhode Island who heads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was ripe for defeat in this fall's elections.
After five terms, he seemed old and often absent-minded, especially by comparison with his aggressive, energetic 43-year-old Republican challenger, Representative Claudine Schneider. He had been rated as one of the worst members of the Senate by Washington Monthly magazine and accused of lackluster leadership of his committee by colleagues and newspapers. He had not had a tough electoral fight since 1972, when politics was more courtly.
Mr. Pell also holds a dangerous job. In the last two decades alone, no fewer than three chairmen of the committee the Senator now heads have been defeated - J. William Fulbright, Frank Church and Charles H. Percy. 
 
A Prime Republican Target
Republican tacticians in Washington rated Mr. Pell as one of their two or three prime targets for 1990, and Democrats shook their heads mournfully.
Now there are only five weeks left until Election Day, not very much time to turn things around. Mr. Pell leads one recent poll by 12 percentage points, another by 23. A Republican elder who once foresaw victory for Ms. Schneider said this week: ''I think her campaign is coming to an unfortunate close. Barring an act of God, he's going to win again.'' So what happened? To the outsider, Mr. Pell seems an anachronism, a throwback to the days when Northeastern states regularly sent people with patrician names like Saltonstall, Roosevelt, Frelinghuysen and Lodge to Washington. In an age of self-promoters, he is a self-effacing man who criticized a tub-thumping press release prepared by his campaign manager, Mary Beth Cahill, with the comment, ''No, no, we never boast.''
But in this rough-and-tumble state, populated largely by the descendants of Roman Catholic immigrants, Mr. Pell's unchallenged honesty, hard work on constituents' problems and good manners have broad appeal. His favorable rating in local opinion polls has not fallen below 75 percent in a decade.
 
Wide Regard for Senator
''Whatever they think in Washington,'' said Scott MacKay, a political reporter for The Providence Journal-Bulletin, ''people here think Pell is a nice man, and she hasn't given people any rationale for throwing him out.''
It's not that Ms. Schneider has lacked for openings. Mr. Pell is an indifferent campaigner who has said of himself, ''I have an uncanny facility for making the most exciting matters gray'' and who conceded last month, ''I'm perfectly capable of shooting myself in the foot.'' He nearly did so in a televised joint appearance with Ms. Schneider on Aug. 1, when he found himself unable, in response to a question, to think of examples of bills he had passed for Rhode Island.
But the next day, Iraq invaded Kuwait, and foreign policy, not television gaffes, took over the news broadcasts and front pages here. Before long, both were flooded with images of the Senator visiting Saudi Arabia. Although Mr. Pell's strategists here doubt it, others think he benefited hugely from the turn of events.
 
Key Role on Foreign Relations
''Voters are inclined to think that being chairman of Foreign Relations is a distraction, something irrelevant to their concerns,'' said Robert Squier, the Senator's media consultant. ''Now, suddenly, it matters, because their kids and brothers and sisters may have to go over there.''
Ms. Schneider has made a major effort to create an age issue, though she has done so indirectly, by emphasizing her vigor, by deriding ''the old-boy network'' in Washington and by talking of new answers for a new era.
''I've got fire in my belly,'' Ms. Schneider said in her announcement. ''He wasn't even sure for a while that he wanted to run again.''
But Rhode Island has the second-largest percentage of people over 65 years old of any state, and older voters remember with affection Mr. Pell's predecessor as senator and as Foreign Relations chairman, Theodore Francis Green, who served until he was 93. Mr. Pell marched in the July 4 parade in Bristol, evoking the past by wearing the same white suit he has worn for 30 years, but he also ran a 10,000-meter race the Sunday before he announced.
The Senator may have been helped as well by the recession that started taking hold here about six months ago. A clerk in an antiques shop in Providence said the other day that she liked Ms. Schneider, had voted for her for Congress and thought she would make a good senator in the future.
 
Sense of Security for Voters
''But not this year,'' she said. ''Things are bad, and Pell is about all we've got going for us in Washington. It's no time to change horses.'' Ms. Schneider, who has the backing of national women's groups and some environmental organizations, has spoken to economic concerns by criticizing Mr. Pell's vote for the savings and loan bailout and his backing for changes - ''tampering'' she calls them - in the Social Security system.
But her campaign has had its difficulties. The campaign manager, Ellen Conway, reportedly clashed with the candidate and then, in the midst of a troubled pregnancy, moved to Middletown, Ohio, where she is trying to keep in touch by phone and fax. A nautical pilot who endorsed Ms. Schneider's environmental record turned out to have been involved in an oil spill himself.
Despite the polls and other setbacks, Ms. Schneider has stuck to her commitment not to conduct a negative campaign against Mr. Pell, and as a result Rhode Island's campaign has probably been the most gracious Senate race in the country so far this year. In a television commercial in which she supports the use of the death penalty in some circumstances, she made her point gently: ''I know my opponent is concerned about crime, but I just think we have to get tougher.''
And in a television debate, Ms. Schneider pictured herself as the candidate focused on the future but added, ''We all love Claiborne Pell.''
 
No Need to Go Negative
Robert Rendine, her deputy campaign manager, said of the media strategy: ''You look at this type of message and see what kind of movement you get. We're very satisfied with our commercials, which point out the differences, however subtly, and we think they're working. We don't think there's any need to go negative, but we are ready to do whatever the candidate decides she wants to do.''
Some political analysts in Rhode Island think that a negative campaign would be counterproductive, at least at this stage of the campaign.
''It's too late,'' said Darrell M. West, a political science professor at Brown University who conducts its polls. ''Turning negative would run counter to her whole stance so far, and it would run counter to her political persona. She has positioned herself as a warm, caring individual, not as a Jesse Helms, always ready to attack. She would alienate Pell supporters and lose part of her own base.''
Seeking some insurance, perhaps, the Pell campaign has begun airing a commercial in which voters say things like ''Negative campaigning is going to backfire'' and ''Negative campaigning doesn't work, especially someone going negative on someone like Senator Pell'' and ''Don't down everybody.''

HEADLINE: The Budget Agreement;
Excerpts From House Budget Debate

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
When the House of Representatives took up the deficit-reduction package devised by the White House and Congressional leaders, lawmakers voiced misgivings and support before defeating the package early today. Following are excerpts from the debate. The remarks of Thomas S. Foley, the House Speaker, were recorded by The New York Times courtesy of C-Span, and the other lawmakers' statements were provided by their Washington offices:
 
Robert H. Michel
Republican of Illinois
As far back as May of this year when it became obvious that we were not going to meet our deadlines, the President felt he had no recourse but to convene a budget summit on a bipartisan basis again, to get members off dead center. We all know the sequence of events that followed, but only a few members have been privy to the give and take that tookay or place, the tortuous negotiations, particularly in the last 10 days of those negotiations.
I have heard those members who expressed frustration at being on the outside and looking in. I wish there were a better way of doing it. I made mention to some of my members that I wish we could have run different members in randomly, a couple at a time for several days, so everyone would get the flavor of it. So that members would realize that, brother, this is no black and white easy issue one way or another. . . . 
Suffice it to say that the strong point of our agreement can be found only its totality. We have to accept it as a whole, as it provides the only bipartisan basis for attacking the deficit problem. We lose this moment, pick apart the agreement with 1,000 points of spite, and we not only lose the agreement but the ability to truly govern.
What we have wrought is a package that reduces the deficit by $41 billion in 1991 and $500 billion over five years. We were shooting for $50 billion and $500 billion, but then we found out when we got there in the last day or so that, frankly, the kind of revenue increases we had in mind by way of the gasoline tax were probably too much for the economy to assimilate. So we struck the numbers down to $41 billion in that first year. It is the largest deficit-reduction package that has ever been contemplated.
 
Projected Savings
The agreement does produce $120 billion in entitlement and mandatory changes, getting at the very heart of the fastest-growing part of the budget.
Medicare alone is now $90 billion this year; five years from now it will be $180 billion. It is the fastest-growing program in the Government, increasing at a rate of 12.6 percent a year.
What did we do by this agreement which is getting so much criticism in the area? We cut the rate of growth by 1.6 percent per year. However, I will say folks, if we cannot make any savings in the entitlement programs at this time, I do not know where we are going to be in a generation. ...
Oh, I wish members would just think about this problem and the trauma we had when the mathematics did not play out. We have divided Government. The President is of the Republican Party and Democrats control this House. I have never once been in the majority in this House for 34 years. I would like to do it sometime, but it has not happened. I regret that, but we must come together.
This is why I appeal to you. Tough, tough thing to do. After years of passing out the goodies, and running deeper and deeper in debt, now is the time to ante up, to pay up.
It is a difficult situation. However, I wish we would get a little bit of consideration for the trauma that your negotiators had to go through over all that period of time. Give members some credit for having some sense, and what we were able to do in a very practical way with the mathematics and the divided Government with which we had to contend.
I hope members will give this an affirmative vote. It is not the last day because we still have an opportunity through reconciliation, to improve the product. I would appreciate it if members could vote for it, and help out on this important vote.
 
Thomas S. Foley
Democrat of Washington
Mr. Speaker, I take the well seldom. I take it tonight late in this legislative day - late, perhaps, in the life of our country - to deal with a critical problem we have all ignored too long. Members of the Congress have ignored it, members of both parties have ignored it, Presidents have ignored it.
And over the period of recent years, in the life of those who have served in this body - and within the time of their service - the interest on the Federal debt has grown to a figure now third-largest of all the expenditures in the Federal budget. And greater, significantly enough, than the entire budget was only a few years ago.
This budget resolution is the result of a much-decried summitry which is, as the majority leader indicated, the result of a divided Government in which there is a Republican President and a Congress led by majorities of the Democratic Party. The problem is not divided into a Republican problem and a Democratic problem; it is a problem that faces all of us. It faces the country and it affects every American. ...
The President said today to me, and I repeated it to the press, that it was our conviction along with the bipartisan leadership that many of the elements established in the budget agreement were for illustrative purposes only, and that the legislative committees had the right, as well as the obligation, to consider alternative policies to achieve similar savings.
Every member will have the opportunity to decide for himself or herself whether the legislative process of the next two weeks accomplishes that to their satisfaction or no. And every member will have an opportunity -several opportunities - to say yes or no to the product of the legislative reconciliation bill and the appropriation bill to follow. ...
I ask you to consider that this is one of the most important evenings, perhaps - in your professional careers, this is one of the most important decisions that you will make. And although the hour is late and although the debate has been long, and although the passions have been real and although the divisions are sincere, we have an opportunity to stand together and at least the decision to go forward, at least the decision to give an opportunity for a decision, at least a chance to make this process work for ourselves, for the President . . . and for the American people. And we must ask ourselves this question: If not now, when?
 
Dick Armey
Republican of Texas
Mr. Speaker: The leadership has defined for us tonight a singular choice between the summit package or sequestration. That is what we are to judge. Never mind that that choice is itself a fiction, like the summit package, that is what we have to judge today.
So, given that choice defined for us by the leadership, I'll take sequester. The reason is simple: Sequester hurts the Government, and this summit package hurts the American people and their economy. Let me explain what I mean. As I have analyzed the potential economic effects of this summit package, I believe it will fail. It will fail the economy, and it will fail to reduce the deficit.
Mr. Speaker, the pain of deficit reduction may be inevitable, but the suffering is optional. If we vote for this package, we vote to accept the option to suffer. Why would this happen? I remember the days of national malaise, and I don't want to return to the conditions of stagflation, simultaneous inflation, recession with its increasing unemployment rates and decreasing production. This is what I believe we will get with the economy, as the chairman of the Budget Committee says, today teetering on the edge from the immediate, the certain and the repressive taxes that are in this package. That is all that is certain in this package in my estimation.
And if we get that stagflation, leading as it will with inflation, within the context of current services budgeting - a God-awful contraption created by government and defining the surrender terms to inflation - we will then have an inevitable rise in the cost of government with expenditures increasing. And then if we get the other part of that stagflation which I predict we will get, and the rising unemployment and the lowering production, we will see the revenues decrease and it is my estimate that five years from now the deficit will be worse instead of better and you will have opted to suffer. I say vote no.
 
David R. Obey
Democrat of Wisconsin
Mr. Speaker, why are we here? We are here because in 1981 the Congress doubled military spending at the request of the Reagan Administration, it cut taxes for the rich, it tripled our national indebtedness, it tripled the size of our deficits. And so we are here to try to clean up the mess of the 1980's.
In the 1980's, the richest 1 percent of Americans whose average income started the decade at $313,000 ended the decade with their income averaging $550,000. Meanwhile, the average middle-class American precisely at the midstream of American income saw the purchasing power of his income drop by $2,000.
This package contains something I have wanted to see for 10 years since the disastrous votes on the Reagan supply-side riverboat gamble. But the way it gets to that deficit reduction is absolutely outrageous. The White House has indeed succeeded in protecting and insulating the very wealthiest of all Americans from all but the tiniest hit.
And so as a result, this package is required to hit middle-income Americans twice as hard as it hits the very wealthiest of all Americans. It is required to say that you are going to make some poor devil who loses his job wait two weeks before he can collect an unemployment check. You are going to drive farmers to the wall.
All so that the President can keep his promise not to raise tax rates on people making more than 200,000 bucks. That is economically wrong, it is immoral and we ought not stand for it.
I have looked all day for any way to try to help keep the process going. The Speaker knows that, the majority leader knows that. And I am not going to tell anybody how to vote.
But I just have to tell you, if this package goes down tonight, I beg the President to recognize that what has to happen to bring us together is a sense of fairness. The Congress is the last hope of every American who expects to get a square deal. They are not getting a square deal when we continue to insulate the rich and to lay it off on the middle-class worker who is not paying as much attention, lay if off on the Medicare recipients because they do not have the attention span that the Chamber of Commerce president has in your local district. I beg you, when this goes down, it it goes down: come back to this floor with renewed dedication to fairness. I regretfully must vote no on this package.

HEADLINE: The Budget Agreement;
In the End, the Feeling The Budget Was Unfair

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OMAHA, Oct. 5

 BODY:
All the months of high-level meetings that produced the budget deal, all the pleading by the White House and the Congressional leaders to get lawmakers to approve it, can seem a pale reality next to a furious switchboard at a Congressman's district office.
''It looks to me like certain people have been singled out here,'' said a man who called Representative Peter Hoagland's office Thursday afternoon as the House prepared to vote.
Most of the callers turned the cool policy choices of Washington into red-hot grievances. ''This gas tax, to the people of Nebraska, is a killer,'' a caller said. Over two days, this Omaha office received 214 calls against the budget plan and 67 for it - even after President Bush urged Americans in his televised address Tuesday night to rally their lawmakers around it. 
This is the unyielding tether of electoral politics that helps explain the votes of those like Representative Hoagland, a Democrat who voted against the budget plan as it went down to thunderous defeat early Friday morning. An Unfair Proposal? People interviewed here said they were worried about the deficit and the economy. Many of them said they believed, as Gary Points, a computer programmer put it, that ''we're going to crash and burn if we don't do something about it.'' And while some argued that maybe Washington should let the automatic spending cuts of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law go into effect, others were wary.
Still, there was a powerful feeling that the package proposed was simply unfair, was too great a burden on working people and the elderly and took too big a bite out of farm programs.
Three construction workers eating their lunches in the warm sun of early autumn talked at length about the gas tax this afternoon. Prices are already up as a result of the crisis in the Persian Gulf, they noted, and Nebraska's gas tax is already one of the highest in the nation. Now comes talk of another boost, and Ron Miller, a 40-year-old resident of Council Bluffs, Iowa, who often faces long commuting to a job, was irate.
''I just don't like it,'' Mr. Miller said. Kent Grisham, communications director for the Nebraska Republican Party, asserted, ''When you talk about gas taxes, you're talking about the heart of the Midwest.'' It is not just the added costs of transportation, many Nebraskans interviewed said, but the impact on agriculture that makes that tax so onerous here.
 
'What Are We Doing There?'
The three construction workers had some suggestions for reducing the deficit. High on their list was the chronically unpopular expense of foreign aid.
''That's what I'd cut down on,'' said Martin Everts, a 37-year-old Omaha resident. ''And I'd cut some of this military spending. If these countries overseas want our bases out, let's take them out. I don't feel an attack from the Russians or the Chinese is imminent, so what are we doing there?''
Leanne Ziettlow, a city employee among the crowd at the Sons of Italy pasta lunch on Thursday, was one of many people here who said she was troubled by the proposed cuts in Medicare. ''They always seem to put Social Security and Medicare on the table,'' she said.
The cuts in Medicare, Mr. Hoagland said, were critical in his decision to vote against the budget plan. Mr. Hoagland, a freshman narrowly elected in 1988 who is facing a Republican challenger this fall, said he had expressly promised two years ago that he would reject any cuts in Medicare benefits.
 
'I Think It Stinks'
''I said in that campaign that deficit reduction is crucial, but you can't balance the budget on the backs of the elderly and the middle class,'' Mr. Hoagland said, ''and that's what this plan does.''
His Republican opponent, Ally Milder, was planning television commercials that denounce rising gas prices. She was also blaming lawmakers for being part of a system that let the budget get out of control.
Ms. Milder had little use for the budget plan embraced by her President. ''I think it stinks,'' she said. Unlike Mr. Bush, Ms. Milder is still campaigning on a pledge of ''no new taxes,'' and arguing that the deficit could be controlled through spending cuts.
Many here seemed to recognize the policy conundrum that the deficit has created. ''The public is in such an outcry to reduce the deficit and yet, when something is produced to do it, they're in an outcry about new taxes,'' said Carole Tharnish, a 27-year-old supervisor at an insurance company.
Tom Samuelson, human resources director for Epsen Hillmer Graphics Co., said, ''We have at least a 40- or 50-year tradition of politicians saying, 'Increase services and cut taxes. Vote for me.' There's got to be some reckoning.''
Still, the reckoning of this budget package was hard to swallow. ''I think they want Congress to do something and they don't want them to do it at their particular expense,'' said John J. Cavanaugh, an Omaha Democrat who served in Congress from 1976 to 1980.
''I'm damn lucky not to be in Congress, is my conclusion.''

HEADLINE: The Budget Agreement;
Budget Boomerang

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
In provoking what he planned as a one-week confrontation with Congress over the 1991 budget, President Bush instead brought Washington to the brink of a major crisis of confidence about his leadership and the ability of the nation's Government to make a budget.
Many in Washington say the crisis, set off by the rejection in the House early today of a deficit-reduction package months in the making, is a watershed in the nation's budget ordeal.
Democrats and Republicans alike described it as the ultimate breakdown of an approach to budgeting that for nearly a decade has attempted to substitute bipartisan deal making between the President and a handful of Congressional leaders for any real national consensus on Government spending and taxes.
''What this vote proved was that closed-door sessions don't work,'' said Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California. Mr. Thomas wanted lower taxes and more spending cuts. Many Democrats wanted higher taxes on the rich and fewer spending cuts. Almost nobody wanted to cut medical benefits for the elderly. 
 
A Backfire on Television
Pressured by defections in his own party, President Bush appealed to the public. But his televised address on Tuesday evening boomeranged, officials on Capitol Hill said. It not only failed to persuade the public that there was a real crisis, but it drew more attention to the budget deal and helped stir up opposition to it, provoking what one member called ''an avalanche'' of public protest.
Both Republicans and Democrats who walked away from the deal said they were outraged over how it had been presented to them as a fait accompli and agreed with Mr. Thomas that ''the whole process should begin and end with full public debate.''
House members were rejecting not just a proposed budget plan, but an entire insiders' approach to budget making that now seems fatally flawed.
''This is the beginning of the post-Reagan era,'' said Representative Thomas J. Downey, a Long Island Democrat and member of the Ways and Means Committee.
 
A Stockman Legacy
The flaws stem in large measure from the dismantling during the Reagan Presidency of the messy but fairly well-defined procedures set up by the Budget Act of 1974. Those procedures were designed to make Congressional budget making more coherent and more resistant to White House manipulation.
But the 1974 process was effectively overridden by the penchant for private deal making of Mr. Reagan's first budget director, David A. Stockman, and the current budget director, Richard G. Darman.
This deal making became the only way around the larger political stalemate. Mr. Reagan had driven tax increases out of the political dialogue, and Democrats had retaliated by driving cuts in domestic spending, particularly Social Security, off the table.
The only way to get budgets approved was to lump all the pain into one catch-all agreement whose defeat would be even worse than the unpleasantness of all of its parts. The failure of the budget deal today was the failure of this system.
 
Some Tactical Blunders
A set of tactical blunders by the White House contributed to the defeat. Mr. Darman and John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, ignored warnings that defense spending was too high and that Medicare cuts were too deep for the deal to pass.
But the key moment was President Bush's appeal to the nation. The speech was tepid and stunningly brief for a prime-time Presidential address. It did nothing to convince Americans, most of whom believe cutting waste is still the best way to bring down the deficit, that there was a true crisis that required sacrifice.
''The bottom line is that deficit reduction, while it is a top issue inside the Beltway and in select places like Wall Street, to the man and woman in the street means virtually nothing,'' said Representative Charles Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn. ''So the positive good that would come out of deficit reduction is not felt by the public, while the pain is felt by them acutely.''
Mr. Bush, whose 1988 Presidential race did nothing to prepare Americans for austerity, tried to skirt this problem by gathering the bipartisan leadership of Congress around him in the Rose Garden last Sunday so they could share the political blame for a package none of them liked.
 
The Gingrich Factor
But almost immediately the White House was shaken by a revolt started by a member of the President's own party, Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, who drew his support from a small group of Republican backbenchers who thought Mr. Bush ought to be held to his no-taxes pledge. Mr. Gingrich's defection could not by itself have brought down the package, but it made it far easier for Democrats to walk away too.
In the short run, Mr. Gingrich appears to be the dragon slayer. But in the longer term he has big problems. Many of his Republican colleagues are furious with him for forcing a showdown with a Republican President. There is talk of a White House-assisted campaign to oust Mr. Gingrich from his post as minority whip.
Even the Democratic leaders who made the deal with the President expressed grave doubts about it. By this morning, House Speaker Thomas S. Foley was talking about taking back Congressional budget prerogatives from the White House and pressing ahead with a Democratic plan.
But the reason House Democrats did not do this from the beginning is that the Senate's 55 Democrats do not have the votes to pass a purely Democratic plan, because 60 votes are needed to stop a filibuster.
 
New Nexus of Power
Indeed, this crisis illustrates how the House, with its lopsided Democratic majority, has become the nexus of Democratic influence, a striking reversal from the days of Lyndon B. Johnson, Hubert H. Humphrey, Henry M. Jackson and other giants of the Senate.
It is not clear yet how much permanent change in Federal budget making will be wrought by this morning's debacle. Having said that approval of the original compromise was crucial to avoiding recession, the White House now said it had only lost ''a skirmish,'' and Mr. Bush sent his negotiators back to Capitol Hill.
The White House team badly misjudged the politics of Congress, if not of the country. In pressing ahead with a package they were warned might not pass, Mr. Darman and Mr. Sununu were apparently emboldened by the President's strong standing in the aftermath of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
Mr. Bush's plan was that Congress would approve the package because the alternative was so much worse: across-the-board budget cuts mandated by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings deficit-reduction law, or even a shutdown of the Government. Mr. Bush tightened the screw further by saying he would not approve temporary extensions of Government spending authority unless a deficit-cutting plan was in place.
''He backed us against a tight deadline, thinking Congress would roll over,'' said Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin.
At 1 o'clock this morning, the House of Representatives said no. ''It's the first time since I've been here that someone didn't blink,'' said Mr. Schumer.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
U.N. Foresaw Kuwait Strike; Warnings Were Not Heeded

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria, Oct. 5

 BODY:
For several days before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, officers serving with a United Nations force in southern Iraq reported apprehension that the military buildup had the hallmarks of a pending strike across the border, but the warnings were discounted, Western military officials in the region say.
Unlike the United States, which relied largely on satellite intelligence and diplomatic assessments from the distant capital to evaluate President Saddam Hussein's intentions, the United Nations officers were close to the buildup and had more direct knowledge of the deployment, they said.
The officials asked not to be further identified because of the sensitivity of an issue that touches on a broader controversy: How was Iraq able to take not only Kuwait, but also the Bush Administration, by surprise with the invasion? 
The United Nations force was stationed along both sides of the Iran-Iraq border as part of the cease-fire in the eight-year gulf war in August 1988, after a series of military gains by Iraq against a largely exhausted Iran.
Quoting from assessments made privately by United Nations personnel, the Western officials said the buildup in late July was interpreted by officers stationed near the main highway running south to Kuwait as far more than an attempt to intimidate Kuwait into accepting Iraqi terms for a settlement of their economic and territorial dispute.
 
'A Textbook Invasion'
''To some of them, it looked very much like a textbook invasion plan modeled on the Soviet military doctrine'' taught by Moscow's military advisers with the one million-strong Iraqi Army, the officials said.
Technically, the United Nations cease-fire force, drawn from more than 20 nations, is supposed to maintain strict neutrality between Iran and Iraq and to restrict its activities to monitoring the cease-fire.
That may have created a reluctance by some officers to insist that their assessment be brought to the attention of Western authorities, the officials said. It remained unclear from this account whether the officers' fears had been relayed to United Nations headquarters in New York or to American officials in Baghdad or Washington.
A day before the invasion, Iraqi reinforced the buildup with scores of artillery pieces and other specialized equipment, the deployment of which contradicted the argument it had advanced to Arab allies and to the United States -that it had no intention of invading.
''The feeling among some of the officers at that time was that there could no longer be any mistake that an invasion was under way,'' an official in the region said.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Mubarak Says Israel and Iraq Had Secret Contacts

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, Oct. 5

 BODY:
An assertion by President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt that Israel has been secretly in contact with Iraq in recent weeks drew angry reactions from Israeli officials today, but no denials.
The Israeli officials accused Mr. Mubarak of violating a policy of playing down Israel's role in the Persian Gulf crisis. But one official acknowledged that Israel had informal contacts with Iraq during the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war, and a former Government official said the exchanges had continued through intermediaries during the current confrontation. 
Mr. Mubarak's statements followed several press reports of recent contacts between Iraq and Israel. But his highly public statements were the first to draw an Israeli response.
 
Keeping a Low Profile
Eliyahu Ben-Elissar, chairman of the Israeli Parliament's defense and foreign affairs committee, said that Mr. Mubarak's comments were aimed at undercutting Iraq, not Israel.
''He wants to shame Iraq in the Arab world,'' Mr. Ben-Elissar said of Mr. Mubarak in an interview with Israel's army radio.
But he added: ''Why in the world is he involving us at a time when we are trying so hard - by the by, at the request of the Egyptians, the Americans and others - not to get involved?''
Despite repeated Iraqi threats to attack Israel in the current crisis, Israel has maintained a low profile to avoid undermining United States efforts to mobilize moderate Arab countries to counter Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
 
Role of Harvard Professor
In a speech on Thursday marking the 17th anniversary of Egypt's last war with Israel, Mr. Mubarak said that Iraq and Israel have had indirect contacts for years. He described secret exchanges in 1987 and 1989 through a Harvard University professor.
Mr. Mubarak did not identify the professor, but Israeli newspapers said she was Laurie Mylroie, the co-author of a book that discusses these contacts. A spokeswoman for Ms. Mylroie denied she had been a go-between.
Mr. Mubarak said he was disclosing the exchanges in response to Iraqi allegations that Egypt was subservient to the Israeli and United States intelligence services.
He also implied that Egypt had access to Israel's intelligence data under the 1979 peace treaty between the two countries. Israel radio quoted unidentified army officials as denying any exchange of intelligence with Egypt.
The Israeli Foreign and Defense Ministries declined to comment on Mr. Mubarak's statements. Avi Pazner, an aide to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, said in response to a similar report earlier this week that he was unaware of any Israeli-Iraqi contacts during the gulf crisis.
The first report of such contacts was published late last month in The Economist, a British magazine. It said Iraq had been sending messages in recent weeks to Israel through King Hussein of Jordan.
 
Message Sent Through Zambia
''Iraq offered not to attack Israel if Israel would agree not to attack Iraq in the event of a war in the gulf,'' the publication said. ''Israel replied, again through King Hussein, that it had no plan to attack Iraq or to be involved in the gulf crisis.''
The Government-run radio in Jordan reported that the Iraqi message had been sent to Israel via President Kenneth D. Kaunda of Zambia.
The Economist said the contacts included meetings between Israeli officials and the Iraqi Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, and his deputy, Nizar Hamdoon. It said that at least two proposed meetings with an Israeli Cabinet minister had fallen through.

HEADLINE: Curbs on Imports of Textiles And Shoes Vetoed by Bush

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
President Bush vetoed a bill imposing tight quotas on imports of textiles and shoes today, saying the measure ''picks the pockets of United States consumers'' by drastically driving up prices to the tune of $2,600 a family over five years.
He called the measure ''reprehensible'' and said it would cause an ''economic calamity'' by forcing a collapse of international trade talks.
Congress had ignored threats of a veto in enacting the legislation, which would impose quotas of its own on imports of textiles, textile products and nonrubber shoes. 
 
Regulated by Agreements
Trade in textiles is regulated by international agreements that impose other quotas.
''This highly protectionist bill would damage the national economy, increase already artificially high costs to consumers of several basic shoes and abrogate our international agreements,'' Mr. Bush said in his veto message.
Disputing claims by the bill's supporters, President Bush said the textile industry was doing well. Domestic production has been up slightly since 1987, he said, and unemployment in major textile-producing states is lower than the national average.
''Economic indicators illustrate that the problems this bill is intended to address do not exist,'' he added.
''The consumer costs of all restrictions on textile and apparel imports are conservatively estimated to increase to a total of $160 billion over the next five years,'' Mr. Bush said. ''That amounts to an onerous $2,600 for a family of four over that same period.
 
Annual Rises Seen
''These costs would continue to rise annually,'' he added. ''In essence, this legislation picks the pockets of United States consumers in order to subsidize the textile industry at a cost of $70,000 annually per job saved.''
President Bush said there would be swift retaliation against the United States by nations affected by the quotas. American companies would be particularly hard-hit in agriculture, aerospace, high technology, capital goods and services, he said.
Moreover, he said, ''this protectionist bill unquestionably would result in a mass exodus of perhaps half the 100 nations'' participating in the international trade talks under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
The Pound Rises Sharply On News of Links to Europe

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A surging British pound dominated foreign exchange trading yesterday as dealers scrambled to buy sterling after Britain announced that its currency would be formally linked to other major European currencies.
The dollar rose against its leading foreign counterparts except the pound and the Japanese yen, rebounding from a selloff on Thursday set off by expectations of lower interest rates in the United States.
The dollar buying came mostly as a byproduct of cross-trading between sterling and the German mark. 
Gold prices gained modestly in domestic trading but moved mostly lower overseas.
Traders in the United States said the dollar had begun on a weak note as a result of news of another deterioration in the country's job market.
The Labor Department reported an increase in the unemployment rate for the third straight month and a decline in non-farm payrolls. The jobless rate rose to 5.7 percent in September from August's 5.6 percent.
The House's rejection of a $500 billion deficit-cutting compromise also was a negative for the dollar because it cast doubt on the Government's ability to solve the deficit problem.
Britain's move, which is expected to help the country fight inflation and improve its economic prospects, will be coupled with a one percentage point cut in key British interest rates to 14 percent.
The pound jumped to $1.9455, from $1.9185 before the announcement, in London, and was more than three cents higher than its level of $1.9115 late on Thursday.
Against Europe's pivotal currency, the German mark, the pound finished at 2.9933 marks, up from 2.9322 late Thursday. The pound will enter the European system at 2.95 marks and be allowed to fluctuate by 6 percent either way.
The pound also bounded ahead in New York. It took $1.9525 to buy a pound late in the session, more costly than $1.9145 late Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Thursday's late quotes, included: 1.5475 German marks, up from 1.5340; 1.2940 Swiss francs, up from 1.2800; 5.1850 French francs, up from 5.1375; 1,160.25 Italian lire, up from 1,149.00; and 1.1524 Canadian dollars, up from 1.14865.
Gold prices were mixed. On New York's Commodity Exchange, bullion for October delivery settled at $393.60 an ounce, up $1.30 from Thursday. Later, the Republic National Bank quoted a bid for gold of $394 an ounce, 80 cents higher than Thursday's 4 P.M. bid.
Silver prices edged down. On New York's Comex, silver for current delivery settled at $4.667 an ounce, down from $4.668 on Thursday. In London, silver fell to a late bid of $4.69 an ounce, from $4.71 late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Recent Rate Policy of Fed

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers decided two weeks after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait to keep interest rates unchanged but to permit lower rates if economic conditions warranted, records released today show.
Short-term rates, which the Fed has used for two years in combating inflation, did not change after the Aug. 21 meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee. They have been at 8 percent since midsummer.
''The information reviewed at this meeting suggested that economic activity was continuing to expand at a relatively slow pace,'' said the minutes of the meeting of the Fed's policy-making body.
While the economy remained sluggish, the minutes continued, ''crude oil prices had risen sharply in spot markets in the weeks before the committee meeting, largely in response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.'' Even before the Aug. 2 invasion, the minutes said, inflationary pressures outside food and energy persisted.
The minutes said that by an 11-to-0 vote the committee adopted a directive that called for keeping rates unchanged at least initially but allowing for easing if warranted.
The committee, which is composed of the seven Fed governors and five of the 12 regional presidents, meets in secret eight times a year to formulate monetary policy.

HEADLINE: Dow Off 6.19 to 2,510.64 in Wild Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks fluctuated wildly yesterday after Congress balked on the budget, President Bush warned that he would veto plans to delay drastic cuts and oil prices rose for a time above $38 a barrel.
After some violent gyrations, the Dow Jones industrial average ended at 2,510.64, down 6.19 points for the day but ahead 58.16 for the week.
Oil rose $1.06 a barrel, to $37.99, after a high of $38.30, giving traders fits.
Birinyi Associates said program trading continued heavy, with waves of computerized buying and selling lifting the Dow 22 points. 
The pattern suggested that repeated waves of computerized trading could have contributed both to a steep early-morning drop and a hefty rise around 1:15 P.M. Rise in Oil Price Cited ''The rally was doing all right until crude rose above $38,'' said Peter G. Grennan, head of stock index futures for Shearson, Lehman Brothers. ''For a while crude took a back seat, but when the price rises $1 or more, it reminds you of another problem.'' Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Fed, has given investors hope that he might lower interest rates. But with Congress waffling, the Dow plunged 59 points in the first quarter-hour.
The New York Stock Exchange intervened instantly under its 50-point rule preventing program traders from selling on a downtick. The rule stays in effect until the Dow moves to within 25 points of the previous close, which could mean it stays in effect all day. Yesterday, the Dow jumped so fast that the rule was in effect barely an hour.
After the Bush warning, stocks turned, by 1:15 soaring 83 points from the low. They quickly turned again, dropping until 2:15, and when oil rose above $38 the decline deepened. By 3:30 the Dow had slid 40 points from its high, recovering slightly by the close.
''It's rare in history the market has to contend with so many things -third-quarter earnings, the Middle East, the price of crude, whether the Fed will ease or not, the budget,'' Mr Grennan said. ''It creates a lot of volatility.'' 160 New Lows Trading rose to a still-anemic 153.4 million shares, from 145.4 million Thursday. But 893 stocks fell and 160 touched new lows, while 598 rose and only 2 reached new highs.
Even new highs were vulnerable. Ralston Purina reached a new high Thursday but fell 2 1/8, to 102 7/8. Travelers, Aetna Life and Casualty and Cigna, the big insurers, fell to new lows.
Travelers slid to 15 7/8, ending at 16 3/8, down 4 3/8. It cut the dividend and said it would lose $500 million in the third quarter after raising reserves on mortgages and other investments. Aetna fell to 33 5/8, ending down 3 3/4. Cigna fell to 36, ending at 36 1/8, down 2 3/4.
British stocks traded in this country jumped after news that Britain would link the pound closely to European money and cut a key British interest rate to 14 percent.
 
Drop in Rates Seen
Madhav Dhar, global strategist for Morgan Stanley & Company, said the weak British stock market ''completely turned around'' after the news. Analysts felt British interest rates might come down now, he said. British Telecom rose 4 1/8, to 55 1/8; Racal Telecom 4, to 52 1/2; Imperial Chemical 3 3/4, to 69 1/4; Pioneer Electric 3 1/2, to 70; British Gas 2 7/8, to 44 1/4; Barclays 2 3/4, to 28 3/4; National Westminster 2 1/2, to 31 3/4, and Cadbury Schweppes 4 1/8, to 64 3/4.
Even Reuters, which fell to a new low of 38 3/8 after S. G. Warburg and Goldman, Sachs lowered their earnings estimates, rose 2 7/8 on Nasdaq, to 42 3/4. It topped the Nasdaq active list, with 2.5 million shares traded.
Hanson P.L.C., the British conglomerate, topped the Big Board active list, rising 3/4, to 19 3/4, on 3.3 million shares.
Despite the rise in crude, Texaco fell 1 1/8, to 60 1/4, and Mobil 1 3/8, to 61. British Petroleum rose 2 3/8, to 82 5/8. General Motors rose 1 1/4, to 36 7/8, in heavy trading, even after Joseph S. Phillippi cut his earnings estimate because orders for big cars fell after the Middle East crisis.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Talk in Moscow

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Oct. 5

 BODY:
Representatives of Wall Street are in Moscow to help the Soviet Union revive a network of stock and commodity exchanges that have been outlawed for more than 70 years.
A delegation from the New York Stock Exchange led by its chairman, John J. Phelan Jr., will open a three-day seminar on Monday on the fundamentals of creating, operating and regulating financial markets. 
For more than 400 potential Soviet investors, speculators and stockbrokers invited by their Government, it will be a crash course on the previously forbidden world of private property, raising of capital and stock speculation, a Big Board spokesman, Richard Torrenzano, said today.
A stock market flourished in St. Petersburg, now Leningrad, from 1703 until the 1917 Revolution, and there were more than 100 commodity exchanges elsewhere in Russia until the Bolsheviks outlawed them.
Still, both Russians and Americans say the re-establishment of a Soviet stock exchange is a long way off. The Government still owns 80 percent to 90 percent of the property in the country and is only gradually lifting the ban on private ownership.
The seminar, sponsored by the Big Board and the Soviet Finance Ministry, is the result of a suggestion by President Bush to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union at their Malta summit meeting last December.

HEADLINE: Sun Microsystems Puts Limits on Spending

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
Confronted with growing business uncertainty and concerned that the country is heading toward recession, Sun Microsystems Inc., a maker of computer work stations, put tight spending controls and a hiring freeze into place this week.
In a memorandum to employees, Sun's chief executive, Scott McNealy, said that the company would immediately halt hiring, reduce the number of contractors and consultants, limit corporate travel and cancel most discretionary expenses like off-site meetings and entertainment.
In the memorandum, which was circulated on Tuesday, Mr. McNealy wrote: ''Leading economic indicators are down, capital spending plans appear to be weakening. This is compounded by the uncertainties arising from the Middle East crisis.'' 
Sun, based in Mountain View, Calif., has been among the fastest-growing makers of work stations, which are used by scientists and engineers and in financial applications. In the last year, the company has introduced several low-cost models that have begun to blur the distinction between engineering work stations and the most powerful desktop personal computers.
Sun's rapid growth and the increase in its market share have continued in the face of I.B.M.'s re-entry into the work station market. The International Business Machines Corporation made an early, abortive entry into the work-station market with the I.B.M. PC/RT and now is trying to re-enter with a revamped line using new technology.
Mr. McNealy told employees that Sun was better positioned to face a recession than some of its competitors but that the company should be ''highly conservative'' in managing its cash.
''It's clear to anybody taking even a casual look at the computer business that everybody is seeing a slowdown,'' said John C. Levinson, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs & Company, who lowered his earnings estimate for Sun last week. ''The reason is purely economic, the company is not losing market share.''
''I think it actually says they're a more mature company, and they're anticipating a downturn,'' said Lucianne Painter, an analyst at Salomon Brothers. ''Every company is taking a hard look at expenses.''
Sun's stock closed down 75 cents yesterday, at $18.25, in trading on Nasdaq.
 
Growth Still Expected
Company officials said Sun believed that it was still growing at the pace of the quickly expanding work station market, which has been rising at a 30 to 35 percent rate quarter-to-quarter.
''We have a sensitive business model,'' said William J. Raduchel, Sun's chief financial officer. ''When you're a growing company, and you're laying on expenses at the rate that we are, you have to be very sensitive to changes in projected revenue.''
Sun was aided by strong sales of its low-priced computer work stations in the most recent quarter. It reported sharply improved results for its fourth quarter and for the 1990 fiscal year.
For the quarter ended June 30, Sun had net income of $49.1 million, or 51 cents a share, in contrast to a loss of $20.3 million last year. Revenues jumped 62 percent, to $700.1 million from $431.2 million. The company had previously said that its loss in the fourth quarter of 1989 was attributable to a change-over in computing systems for tracking inventory and accounting.

HEADLINE: For Bonds, Calm After The Storm

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
The Treasury securities market was buffeted by strong crosscurrents yesterday and ended with the shorter maturities posting moderate gains and the longer issues essentially unchanged.
Dealers said the first blow to the bond market was Congress's failure to approve a budget-deficit reduction package in the early morning hours.
An immediate reaction occurred in Tokyo, where United States Treasury debt issues were sold heavily, a trend that carried over to the opening of the New York bond and stock markets. The flight of capital from the stock market into Treasury bills was such that discount rates plunged briefly to their lowest level since August 1988. 
 
Virtually Paralyzed
''Confounding the bond market is whether we will have a budget agreement when trading resumes after the Columbus Day holiday on Monday,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. ''If there is no budget, then we will have no auction of bills or Resolution Funding Corporation bonds on Tuesday, and no auction of seven-year notes on Wednesday because the Government won't be able to borrow or spend.'' The bond market would be virtually paralyzed.
Stocks also fluctuated wildly yesterday after Congress balked on the budget, By the close, however, the Dow Jones industrial average was down by only 6.19 points for the day at 2,510.64 and was ahead 58.16 for the week. [Page 34.] The bond market's decline was soon arrested by the Government's report of a large rise in non-farm unemployment in September. Even with the discharge of thousands of census workers last month, the loss of 59,000 jobs exceeded most forecasts.
 
Little Cheer for Market
But the employment data did little to cheer the bond market, which normally considers any negative economic news as bullish because it protects the value of outstanding fixed-income securities from inflation and higher interest rates on newer debt issues.
''The reason for the bond market's lack of enthusiasm was that the report also told of a five-tenths of 1 percent rise in average hourly wages during September, which is considered inflationary,'' Mr. Sullivan said. ''The President's promise to veto Federal spending until an acceptable budget is achieved also unsettled the bond market.''
As a result, late trading found the Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 8.75 percent issue maturing in August 2020, unchanged at 99 19/32, as was its yield at 8.78 percent, compared with 8.93 percent a week ago. During the stormy session, the price of the long bond ranged from a low of 98 28/32 after the opening to a high of 99 25/32.
Meanwhile, fears that rising overseas interest rates would reduce the attractiveness of Treasury debt issues abated somewhat during the week. The yield on Japan's 10-year long bonds, for example, plunged to 8.11 percent from 8.69 percent during the week, largely because of shifts of capital in fixed-income debt issues from Tokyo's weak stock market. Despite the mounting cost of German reunification, the yield on Germany's 10-year long bonds declined to 9.08 percent, from 9.12 percent a week ago.
News yesterday that Britain was moving to join the European Monetary System caused the yield on London's 10-year long ''gilts'' to drop 40 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 11.25 percent. As for the Treasury's equivalent issue, the 8.75 percent long notes of August 2000, they closed unchanged at 100 23/32, and a yield of 8.63 percent, well down from 8.79 percent a week ago.
Among shorter representative Treasury maturities, the 8 1/8 percent notes of 1992 gained 2/32, at 100 19/32, for a yield of 7.79 percent; the 8 1/4's of 1994 rose 2/32, to 101 6/32, to yield 8.14 percent, and the outstanding seven-year notes, the 8.5's of 1997, also rose 2/32, at 99 30/32, for a yield of 8.50 percent.
 
Best Gains Found in Bills
But the best gains on the day were found in the Treasury bill market, where the early flight to quality from the then tumbling stock market caused the discount rate on the 90-day bills to drop nine basis points, to 7.04 percent, after briefly touching 6.99 percent, a 25-month low. The rate on the six-month bills fell six basis points, to 7.08 percent, and the one-year bills lost three basis points, at 7.02 percent.
The Federal Reserve moved to add reserves to the banking system for the Columbus Day weekend. But dealers said the Fed's action was more a protest against the Federal funds rate that banks charge each other for temporary loans. The funds were trading at 8 3/16 percent when the Fed intervened just before midday, and then declined to close at 7 15/16 percent. The consensus among credit market analysts is that the Fed has preferred a funds rate of 8 percent since July, when its target was lowered from 8.25 percent.

HEADLINE: In a Party Split, Kemp Endorses Conservative's Bid for Governor

BYLINE: By FRANK LYNN

 BODY:
Breaking with the Republican candidate for governor of New York, Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, last night endorsed Herbert London, the Conservative gubernatorial candidate.
Mr. Kemp, a likely Republican Presidential contender in the future, gave Mr. London, who is a registered Republican himself, a major boost in his effort to attract Republicans dissatisfied with their party's nominee, Pierre A. Rinfret.
Mr. Kemp's endorsement came on a day in which the campaign of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who is running for a third term, reported receiving almost three times as much interest on campaign bank accounts as Mr. Rinfret had in his war chest.
 
Criticism Expressed Privately
Many Republican politicians in the state have privately expressed dissatisfaction with Mr. Rinfret's erratic campaigning, particularly his criticism of State Senate Republican leaders in the last two weeks. But few have publicly disavowed him. Mr. Kemp's move could encourage more public defections in the final month before the Nov. 6 election. 
The Secretary chose as his forum one of the most prestigious conservative events of the year, the 35th anniversary celebration of William F. Buckley's National Review magazine at the Waldorf-Astoria last night. The National Review has also endorsed Mr. London, a dean at New York University, who is making his first statewide race. [Mr. Buckley announced at the banquet that he would soon resign as chief editor. Article, page 28.] Mr. Kemp's endorsement of Mr. London was only a brief part of his speech, which was largely devoted to conservatism and the magazine, but in an interview later, he said of Mr. Rinfret, ''Any candidate who runs for governor of New York and criticizes Ronald Reagan for cutting taxes, does not deserve to be our candidate.''
Mr. Rinfret was returning to Manhattan last evening from some campaign appearances and could not immediately be reached for comment. In recent weeks he has criticized Mr. Kemp, calling him ''a lackey of Mario Cuomo'' and a Benedict Arnold for what Mr. Rinfret contended was covert support of Mr. London. The feud actually dates to the 1988 Presidential campaign, when Mr. Rinfret, an economist, questioned Mr. Kemp's economic credentials.
Mr. Kemp said after his speech that his views were his own, not those of the Bush Administration. But the Administration has given little help to Mr. Rinfret, in any event, for fear that the President would be identified with what many Republicans expect will be a debacle on Election Day.
Mr. London, who did not attend the dinner, said in an interview earlier this week that he hoped for financial support from Kemp allies, but that he did not expect the Secretary, who was a Congressman from Buffalo, to break Republican ranks publicly and endorse him.
In filings yesterday with the State Board of Elections, the Cuomo campaign reported that despite spending more than $1 million on television commercials, it still had more than $6 million available for the last month of the campaign - and for any future political campaigns, state or national, that Mr. Cuomo might make.
 
Fewer Donations Reported
But reports filed by Mr. Cuomo and other candidates showed that contributions slowed significantly in the last three months as the economic downturn that has cut government revenues at all levels also cut into political largesse. The real estate and financial sectors, which have been particularly hard hit, are traditionally among the largest sources of contributions.
The Governor received almost as much money in interest on his campaign bank acounts, $279,047, as he did in direct donations, $284,200, in the period since July 15. His aides said that the lack of a serious challenge was also a factor.
 
Low Rinfret Campaign Coffer
Mr. Rinfret reported that he had only $93,571 in his treasury after withdrawing the $500,000 of his own money which he had earlier committed. He changed his mind to protest what he said was the lack of support from state Republican leaders. Mr. Rinfret raised $400,287 since July 15, more, actually than Mr. Cuomo's donations. He spent $524,678 compared with the Governor's expenditures of $1,881,488.
Mr. London reported contributions of only $121,383 while the Right to Life Party candidate, Louis P. Wein, said he had raised less than $50,000. Mr. London has so far failed to attract Republican donors dissatisfied with the Rinfret campaign.
Ethan Geto, the longtime political adviser to Attorney General Robert Abrams, said that in 25 years in politics, ''this is the worst year for political fund raising.''
As a result, Mr. Abrams, who was criticized by the State Commission on Government Integrity for his personal solicitation of major donors, has raised just under $1 million, half his $2 million goal, Mr. Geto said.
Mr. Abrams has only token opposition from Bernard C. Smith of Northport, L.I., a former State Senator, but he has hoped to use the current campaign as a financial and political springboard for a challenge of Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato in 1992.
The campaign for state comptroller, which many politicians expect to be the closest race, was also the most competitive in campaign finances. Despite his incumbency, Comptroller Edward V. Regan raised about $100,000 less than his Democratic challenger, Carol Bellamy, but was able to compensate for that shortfall by transferring $170,000 from a 1986 campaign committee. Both candidates have about $500,000 on hand for the crucial last four weeks of the campaign.
Mr. Cuomo's major expenditures in the last three months included $170,000 in television commercial production costs, $1,187,090 in television time for the last six weeks and $37,500 to his television consultant, Harvey Cohen. Another major expenditure was $400,000 for ''get out the vote'' mailings for the entire Democratic ticket.
