HEADLINE: Drugs, Terror and Tuna: How Goals Clash 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: GENERAL SANTOS CITY, the Philippines, May 15 

 BODY:
This industrial city on the southern coast of Mindanao Island illustrates how America's various strategic aims in the wars on drugs and terrorism can clash, alienating important allies engaged in battling terrorism.
 Among leaders of the Philippines' important tuna industry here, resentment is running high over trade legislation now on the Senate floor in Washington. The bill includes a provision to eliminate steep import taxes on canned tuna from Andean nations while keeping taxes in place for other countries like the Philippines. 
 The provision has attracted Congressional support because it is seen as bolstering America's war on drugs. The idea is that the bill will help create well-paid jobs in Ecuador and Colombia as an alternative to the drug trade. 
But in another war -- the one against terrorism -- the legislation is causing anger in a country that has become an important part of the administration's plans. 
It comes at a time when 600 American soldiers are helping the Philippine Army track Abu Sayyaf Muslim insurgents in the southernmost Philippines, and President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo has staked much political capital on helping the United States fight terrorism.
Virtually all of the tuna industry of the Philippines is located here and it employs thousands of migrant workers from small Muslim fishing communities that used to be bastions of various Muslim insurgencies. Local officials warn that the legislation could wipe out the tuna industry.
President Arroyo said that passage of the trade provision would deal a severe blow to the economy here while handing a propaganda victory to the Abu Sayyaf movement.
The combination would create heavy domestic pressure for the Philippines to retreat from its active support for the American war on terrorism, she warned in a telephone interview tonight.
"I will try very hard not to, but I will be under tremendous pressure," she said.
In much of the developing world, including Latin America and Africa, trade restrictions or tariffs on products ranging from steel to textiles are causing growing resentment toward the United States. The perception that the Bush administration is a protectionist one is growing.
President Arroyo argued that General Santos, the main city on the southern coast of Mindanao and home to most of the Philippines' tuna fishing fleet and canneries, was central both to the economic future of this region and to the fight against terrorism.
A powerful pipe bomb packed with nails exploded on a crowded sidewalk outside a supermarket here on April 21, killing 15 people and wounding dozens. A second pipe bomb was safely defused before it exploded at another supermarket the same day, and two shopping complexes have recently burned down here in the middle of the night in separate, unexplained incidents.
Police detectives here say that they are still unsure whether the attacks were terrorist incidents, criminal attempts at extortion or some combination of the two. But President Arroyo expresses no such doubts, saying tonight, "The Abu Sayyaf has been trying to get into General Santos and it has been very difficult for us to justify our support for the United States."
In a city where tunas festoon everything from billboards to restaurant signs, and where even the golf tournament is the Tuna Cup, the fishing industry's influence is impossible to miss.
Workers heave baskets of fish onto crude steel carts, which they then pull by hand over to a long open-sided shed. Women wash and sort the fish on long tables, the concrete floor beneath them dark and slippery with fish blood. A few larger tuna, some the size of a man, are carried individually to large, white boxes packed with half-melted ice, to be shipped directly to Japan to be turned into sashimi.
Renato Alonzo, 47, a fisherman in a ragged T-shirt and flip-flops whose boat had just docked after two weeks at sea, said that he had sold his tiny farm and joined a boat crew 10 years ago after learning he could nearly double his income, to roughly $4,000 a year. Now he can afford to send his two sons, aged 12 and 8, to school.
The bustling fishing port here and the nearby row of tuna canneries contrast sharply with most of Mindanao, where peasants still toil on subsistence farms or on large pineapple and coconut plantations. Years of drought, coupled with inadequate irrigation, have crippled agriculture while the global glut of low-priced steel has forced the closing of a big steel mill in northern Mindanao.
The tuna industry here barely existed until the late 1980's when the United States led Japan, Italy and other donor nations in an ambitious foreign aid program aimed at rebuilding the Philippines after the fall of Ferdinand Marcos.
A full-scale guerrilla war was being waged in Mindanao then, a far broader conflict than the handful of kidnappings and possibly bombings linked to Abu Sayyaf now. General Santos City was nearly surrounded by several very large insurgencies that attracted poor youths from the island's Muslim minority. The city had a small fishing fleet, but it mostly caught fish for local consumption.
But the world's richest tuna fishing grounds lay between here and Indonesia, although boats from Thailand mainly fished them then. Foreign donors built the fishing port here as well as a large cargo airport, a container port, extensive roads and a modern phone system, hiring security guards from rebel forces and buying sand, gravel and other construction materials from rebel leaders' businesses.
With ready transportation to foreign markets, six big canneries were built, each employing more than 1,000 workers. The only two other tuna canneries in the Philippines are in Zamboanga City in southwestern Mindanao, the staging area for American troops pursuing Abu Sayyaf. Some 30,000 fishermen now supply the canneries.
The tuna boom has helped persuade all of the rebel movements except the Abu Sayyaf splinter group to lay down their arms under armistices with the government. Many former rebel commanders and foot soldiers have taken jobs at the canneries, which have had no problem with the bombings that have afflicted shopping centers.
Abuhasan Jama is a former major in the Moro National Liberation Front who studied guerrilla warfare in Malaysia in 1979 and 1980 and then spent 13 years fighting the Philippine government in the jungles of Mindanao.
Now he is the security chief at Ocean Canning here, his eldest daughter is in college and he has found jobs at the same cannery for three cousins who are also former guerrillas. "I like to work," said Mr. Jama, 41, recalling that in the jungle "sometimes you'd just eat leaves, the roots."
Mariano M. Fernandez, the general manager of Ocean Canning, said that he used to carry two Smith & Wesson handguns, one strapped on each hip. "It was like the Wild West here," he said, adding that he carries only a cellphone now.
Most of the tuna canned here is sold in the United States under less famous brands like Geisha and Dagim. Bumble Bee and Starkist used to buy large quantities of tuna here but have recently begun relying on Ecuador instead, allowing that country to edge past the Philippines last year to become the second-largest foreign supplier of tuna to the United States, after Thailand. Starkist in particular is now pushing for the elimination of import tariffs on canned tuna from Ecuador.

HEADLINE: Mayor's Welfare Plan Embraces Job Training 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER 

 BODY:
Departing significantly from the welfare policies of his predecessor, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg announced yesterday that his administration planned to provide extensive job training, child care and other programs to help welfare recipients find and hold jobs.
 Mayor Bloomberg took pains to praise Rudolph W. Giuliani's record in putting the changes in welfare into practice, and promised to keep intact its essential elements: fingerprinting people to keep them honest; requiring most to work for their government checks; and keeping the number of people on public assistance as low as possible. 
 "Federal public assistance should be temporary," the mayor said. "If it is not, neither society nor those less fortunate who are receiving benefits will progress." 
The Giuliani administration cut the welfare rolls from 1.2 million to below 500,000. 
Mayor Bloomberg called for a new approach yesterday to help those who had trouble finding and keeping jobs. He mentioned job training to help people find work, and support programs like pregnancy prevention and child care to help welfare recipients stay employed.
Roughly 25 percent of welfare recipients are mentally or physically unfit for work, officials say.
"The success of welfare reform should not be measured solely by reduction in caseloads," the mayor said, "but also by the ability of people to become and remain self-sufficient."
Mr. Giuliani thought job training was ineffective and he did not seek some of the federal money that was available for that purpose.
Mr. Bloomberg also said he felt that certain benefits, like transportation and child care, should not be considered public assistance and not be subject to restrictions. Mr. Bloomberg also said he favored the inclusion of legal immigrants in some welfare programs that are currently limited to citizens. 
Administration officials had no estimate of the cost of the new policies, nor any figures on previous spending of both state and federal money. The city does not contribute to welfare expenditures. New York State received $2.4 billion last year in federal money for welfare recipients. 
The city's Human Resources Administration has sent a 30-page proposal to Congress asking permission to spend some surplus federal funds -- a result of the lower welfare rolls -- on the expanded programs. 
"I will not walk away from my fundamental belief that there are those among us who desperately need help," said Mr. Bloomberg, in a speech at La Guardia Community College. "That sometimes, through discrimination, happenstance or just plain indifference, some people are left out of the great opportunities that this country, state and city provide."
Mr. Bloomberg, like many Republicans in Congress, favors more local flexibility in the spending of federal welfare money. Right now, there are restrictions on the use of the money for programs like education and child care. Most restrictions, however, are imposed by the state, so the Bloomberg administration is also asking for federal legislation that would prohibit the state from interfering in welfare.
Mr. Bloomberg's announcement also marked a difference in tone. Like his predecessor, Mr. Bloomberg spoke of an intolerance for welfare fraud, a preference for work over government dependency and a belief in personal responsibility.
Mr. Giuliani had repeatedly referred to the reliance on welfare as a "sick culture of dependency," but Mr. Bloomberg took a different tack yesterday. 
"All my life, I've been taught, in my home, in my school and in my religious training, that we have an unshakable moral responsibility to help," he said, "no matter that it may be expensive, inconvenient, difficult or unpopular."
Mr. Bloomberg's 30-page proposal is intended to coincide with deliberations in Congress, which is considering how to reconfigure the 1996 federal welfare law, which expires this year. President Bush has proposed that by 2007, 70 percent of welfare recipients have a 40-hour week that includes 24 hours on a job and 16 hours of education or other activities. 
In most states, only 30 percent of welfare recipients are working. In New York City the figure is about 40 percent. Mr. Bloomberg said he hoped that a 70-percent level would not be imposed, saying the city's fragile economy would probably make that impossible. 
In many ways, Mr. Bloomberg is taking a pragmatic approach to policy that is typical of his budding mayoralty. In crime-fighting, quality of life and other social issues, Mr. Bloomberg is aware that he cannot deviate far from the policies of Mr. Giuliani. But his liberal leanings infuse much of what he retains from his predecessor. He believes staunchly that people who are entitled to benefits ought to have them. 
With each attempt to manage crime, homelessness, welfare and other issues, he risks alienating the loudest proponents of Mr. Giuliani's policies as well as the social policy advocates on the other side of the fence, who seek wholesale changes.
Both sides appear to have heard what they wanted in the mayor's remarks yesterday.
"I am very happy with the new mayor's emphasis," said Jason Turner, the architect of Mr. Giuliani's welfare-to-work program that emphasized low rolls, work requirements and, its critics charged, discouraged those who were eligible for benefits from getting them. "It builds off Mayor Giuliani's ground work. There are no major departures in either emphasis or policy contained in that proposal."
Henry A. Olsen, the executive director of Center for Civic Innovation at the the Manhattan Institute, a research organization that helped promote Giuliani policies, had a different though equally complimentary view.
"What he is proposing would stake him out more on the liberal wing of the debate," said Mr. Olsen, citing the mayor's unwillingness to require that 70 percent of recipients work and opposition to time limits on some benefits. But he said, "I think the speech had a very strong rhetorical core, which is that work and self-sufficiency is what we aim for." 
Jennifer March-Joly, the associate executive director for Program and Policy Citizens' Committee for Children of New York, also said that she believed that Mr. Bloomberg had hewed closely in many ways to Mr. Giuliani's program.
"To the extent that emphasizing work is a central component of his plan, there is no shift," she said. "But to the extent that it acknowledges that work support like education, training, housing subsidies, child care and transportation are critical things that keep people in the workplace, that is where there is a significant shift."

 CORRECTION:
A front-page article yesterday about changes in welfare policy under the Bloomberg administration misstated the city's share of public assistance spending under the federal welfare law. It is 25 percent, not zero.

HEADLINE: STOPPING AND GOING; 
The Open Road? It Will Be Hard to Find

BYLINE:  By AARON DONOVAN 

 BODY:
IF it seems that traffic is worse than it used to be, that's because it is. Over the last 30 years, the number of miles that cars and trucks travel on America's highways has nearly tripled. 
 Despite a shaky economy, projections for this year point to a continuation of the trend. "Never before have we entered a summer with so many negative factors influencing travel," said Sandra Hughes, the vice president for travel at the AAA, the former American Automobile Association, at a press conference in Washington yesterday to predict travel conditions over the Memorial Day holiday. 
 Ms. Hughes said that 29.3 million people are expected to travel at least 50 miles from their homes by car for the holiday weekend, 2 percent more than the number last year, in part because fewer people are expected to fly. Because of a less robust economy, Ms. Hughes said, vacationers this summer are expected to "travel closer to home as well as reduce the length of trips and take more one-day outings."
The only way to attempt to avoid the worst traffic snarls is to listen to updates on the radio. "Everybody knows the routes," said Abraham Zadi, 57, a livery driver from Astoria, Queens. Being a professional driver gives him no special knowledge, he said, adding, "I'm like everyone else -- I turn on the radio, look at a map and take my chances."
Traffic is at its worst, of course, during those critical Friday afternoons and Sunday evenings. "If you try to work all day Friday and leave at 4 or 5, everybody's trying to get out of New York at the same time," said Stanley Nelson, a documentary filmmaker from Harlem who drives with his wife and three children to Martha's Vineyard about five times a year. "What should be that first hour of the trip can take three or four hours."
Getting back also requires some thought. Mr. Nelson said he tries to return to the city in a way that eases the return to reality. "The Cross Bronx is always a culture shock," he said. "All of a sudden you're stuck with all those huge trucks. It's a slam-bam ending to your weekend." As an alternative, he said, he takes the Merritt Parkway in Connecticut, an older, truck-free highway with more bucolic scenery.
Mr. Nelson said he gave his 12-year-old daughter, Olivia, puzzle books to keep her busy on the road, and gave his twin 3-year-olds, Kai and Nola, a long break to stretch their legs. "They usually fall asleep for half the ride or so," he said. "That's what saves us."
Some who drive regularly simply refuse to travel during high-traffic days of the season. Mark and Donia Steele, who are retired, have lived in a recreational vehicle for four years, since they sold their home in Alexandria, Va.
"The main thing we've learned is that during Memorial Day, Labor Day and the Fourth of July, it's better to hide," said Mr. Steele, 53, a co-author of "Steeles on Wheels: A Year on the Road in an RV" (Capital Books, 2002). "We find an out-of-the-way place and take refuge for the weekend. We'll go to a place that has nothing to offer, that isn't by a lake or by a historic battlefield, a mountain resort, a national park or, of course, the ocean."
When all is said and done, what is the best way to keep slow traffic from getting on your nerves? "Have nice company," Mr. Zadi said. "That's all you can do."

PERSON: Sharon L. Monsky 

HEADLINE: Sharon Monsky, 48, Leader In Fight Against Rare Illness 

BYLINE:  By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Sharon L. Monsky, a scleroderma sufferer who founded an organization that raised millions of dollars to look for a cure for the disease, died on Saturday in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 48 and lived in Santa Barbara.
 The cause was systemic scleroderma, said Charles Spaulding, a vice president of the organization, the Scleroderma Research Foundation, which Ms. Monsky founded in 1987. 
 Ms. Monsky had systemic scleroderma, a chronic and painful disease afflicting the connective tissues, for two decades. She was the foundation's chairman and chief executive until she died.
"She was a leader in raising awareness and funding in search of a cure for scleroderma," said Dr. M. Kari Connolly, a professor of dermatology and medicine at the University of California at San Francisco, who has been doing research about scleroderma for 10 years. 
The struggle for awareness and money encountered problems. Ms. Monsky said in a 1990 interview with The New York Times: "It's a hard one to sell. It's a mysterious disease. It's an ugly disease. And there are no scleroderma poster children to help."
In the early 1980's, when she found out that she had scleroderma, which hardens the skin and internal organs, Ms. Monsky was given only two years to live. But as she lived on, she decided to create the foundation.
She had a master's degree in business administration and had become a highly regarded management consultant with McKinsey & Company, which she had to leave in 1985 after her health deteriorated. She applied her business expertise to the foundation.
Besides corporate donors, celebrities in the performing arts were persuaded to donate time and money to the cause. 
Ms. Monsky's activities generated more than $14 million for research and helped expand understanding of the disease. Money she disbursed for basic medical research on scleroderma led to the publication of scientific articles exploring potential cures. Her work also helped make scleroderma better known.
The foundation's activities include operating two sites for research on the disease, at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and the University of California at San Francisco. The foundation also has adjunct laboratories at Ohio State, Stanford and Duke Universities.
Born in Omaha, Ms. Monsky was a top amateur figure skater as a teenager. She received a bachelor's degree in economics from Pitzer College in Claremont, Calif., and a master's degree in business administration from Stanford. 
She was separated from her husband, Mark Scher. 
She is survived by her mother, Ramelle Monsky of Palm Desert, Calif.; a son, Max, and two daughters, Samantha and Montana, all of Santa Barbara; a sister, Robin Monsky of Chicago; and a brother, Henry Monsky of Omaha.

HEADLINE: Will Inflation Bets Continue to Pay Off? 

BYLINE:  By FLOYD NORRIS 

 BODY:
DO you remember inflation? To some people it is starting to show signs of life.
 That is not necessarily horrible news. As the Japanese well know, deflation can be a horrible thing, and at the height of this country's economic woes last year, there was a little evidence of deflation here. Now that evidence has gone. 
 As it happens, the financial markets provide a handy measure of inflation expectations: the difference between yields of normal Treasury securities and those that offer a lower guaranteed yield but add in inflation protection. That differential is the break-even inflation rate, as measured by the Consumer Price Index.
Last fall, the break-even inflation rate on 10-year Treasuries fell to 1.3 percent. Now it is up to 2.1 percent. Anyone with a strategy of betting on higher inflation expectations has done well.
That is also true in the stock market. James Bianco, the president of Bianco Research, points out that since the Federal Reserve's last reduction of the federal funds rate, to 1.75 percent on Dec. 11, the stock market stars have been the kind of companies that benefit the most from inflation. Over all, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is down 3.4 percent. But the best-performing industry group is gold stocks, up 37 percent, with industries like forest products and oil and gas drillers not far behind. 
Past is not always prologue, of course, and just because inflation expectations have risen does not mean they will continue to do so. A sustained period of 2.1 percent inflation -- the current market forecast -- would be just fine with most people. "The stock market is saying we avoided the deflation trap," said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of Hoenig & Company. "I'm not willing to declare that inflation is off to the races."
But Mr. Bianco is worried. "The market is trading like we don't have price stability," he said yesterday. "If it were to stop here, I would not get that worked up, but why wait until it is bad?" He thinks the Fed should move quickly to raise rates.
The chances of that seem slim. The economic data show a decent but not extraordinary recovery, one that is built on a continued willingness of consumers to spend. But while there are fewer layoffs these days, the number of people receiving unemployment checks hit a new high this week. The Fed does not appear to be worried about inflation, and it is unlikely to raise rates while the health of the recovery is in doubt. 
As long as the Fed remains happy with low rates, companies are likely to continue betting on them. "The new buzz phrase is 'terming out,' " Mr. Bianco said. Companies with decent credit are issuing 5- or 10-year bonds and then using interest rate swaps to pay far lower rates than would be indicated by the rates on the bonds they are issuing. "When rates do go up," Mr. Bianco said, "it will pinch corporations more than you would expect."
The Fed's devotion to low rates could conceivably change if the stock market's current rally, now just more than a week old, is sustained. In some ways, that move has been a throwback to the good old bubble days. Technology stocks have led the way, as Cisco System's hints of a recovery in its business are magnified by eager speculators. Cisco is up 30 percent since the rally began, while Intel has gained 18 percent. Inflation-sensitive stocks have not been leaders in the latest climb, but most have continued to gain.
On balance, it is hard to believe that inflation is really much of a threat now. But those who thought inflation was going to increase have done much better in 2002 than almost any other investors. Markets that confound conventional wisdom sometimes signal that accepted verities are no longer reliable.

HEADLINE: Notes From Charleston; 
The Fight for the Soul of Coal Country

BYLINE:  By Michael Lipton; Michael Lipton is editor of Graffiti, a monthly news and arts publication in West Virginia.

DATELINE: CHARLESTON, W.Va. 

 BODY:
At the edge of Madison, a small southern West Virginia town once populated largely by miners and mine owners, a large sign proudly informs visitors they have entered "the gateway to the West Virginia coal fields."
 Coal has been West Virginia's blessing and curse for the better part of a century. The evidence is everywhere, and the state's history follows the emotional and violent tug of war between money and human beings, nature and technology. Today the consequences of this struggle are harsher and more polarized than ever because of "mountaintop removal," the latest technique in a long history of mining methods that have been hard on the land, the miners and the communities that depend on the mines. 
 The craggy hills, narrow hollows, streams and lush hardwood forests have long held people here hostage, body and soul. This is the only state that lies entirely in Appalachia, where building a few houses often means grading and leveling steep hillsides. But though we live in a place that requires fighting the landscape, West Virginians are by nature not a confrontational sort and are generally willing to turn the other cheek whenever possible. Lately that "live and let live" philosophy has been put to the test. 
This month's flooding -- some of the worst in the state's history -- and a new ruling by Judge Charles H. Haden II of Federal District Court in Charleston that threatens to severely limit mountaintop removal have now rekindled the long-running debate over how to hang on to an ever-dwindling number of mining jobs while preserving the extreme beauty of the land.
Most of the old jobs are long gone, on a steady decline since the 1940's, when coal field employment peaked at 140,000. In 2000, there were just 15,000 coal miners in West Virginia, despite record coal production.
Yet the 100-million-year-old hills and hollows where West Virginians have camped, hunted and fished are being destroyed in ways pick-and-shovel miners never could have imagined. Draglines, 20-story-tall machines, can move more than 100 tons of rock and dirt at a time. Mountaintops, euphemistically called "overlays," become "valley fills." An Environmental Protection Agency study found that valley fills have already buried more than 700 miles of West Virginia streams.
The coal industry, which has been engaged in varying degrees of mountaintop removal for three decades, still has enormous influence over state politics and a good part of the state's economy, though the fight over environmental effects drags on in the courts. In 1999 Judge Haden handed down a controversial decision that limited mountaintop removal. The decision (overturned by a federal appellate court two years later on a jurisdictional issue) threw the coal industry into a panic. The coal companies threatened layoffs and ultimately handed out hundreds of pink slips right before Christmas. They skillfully played upon the miners' frustration and directed it toward Judge Haden and the environmentalists. The miners joined in an unlikely coalition with the companies to protest the judge's ruling; one tactic was ringing the federal courthouse with dozens of huge coal trucks.
Even those who supported the ruling had to feel some sympathy with the miners. The southern, coal-rich counties, already the poorest in the state, can ill afford to lose jobs, and the federal government projects that mining jobs will decline by another 23 percent by 2010.
As for the land, even longtime miners have mixed emotions. They too see that by the time a mining operation leaves, there are few people left in the area to take advantage of the "development opportunities" left by flat moonlike expanses of land created by mountaintop removal. Residents who haven't been bought out by the coal companies are usually driven out by blasting, dust and truck traffic. Water tables are routinely altered, and it will be many generations before any hardwoods take root on mountaintop removal sites.
Last week, Judge Haden ruled that coal companies can no longer bury streams with mining rubble and charged that federal regulators in the Bush administration who are trying to legalize valley fills have violated the federal Clean Water Act. This time there has been far less reaction from either side than during the earlier court battle. Perhaps the coal interests are regrouping. Or perhaps they realize that their legal position is weak and sense public opinion turning -- though state lawmakers here, like the Bush administration, will probably remain coal-friendly to the last.
This week, driving through flood-ravaged McDowell County, past the twisted remains of mobile homes, overturned cars and houses devoured by rampaging creeks, it was hard not to be angry. There was no visible assistance coming from coal or timbering operators.
It has been decades since the coal towns in the southern part of the state bustled with activity. Engineers, politicians and industry officials may debate how much mining and timbering contribute to the devastating floods. But as the hills literally collapse around them, the people who live there may finally turn into environmental activists.

HEADLINE: Forest Service to Recommend Opening Alaska Forest Area 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16 

 BODY:
In its first major decision on wilderness protection, the Bush administration plans to recommend that nine million acres of the Tongass National Forest in Alaska be opened for logging, mining and road building, while 1.4 million acres of the state's Chugach National Forest receive the highest designation of protection.
 The Forest Service is to announce the recommendations on Friday. In documents, it said it was acting "to ensure that the many wild and beautiful areas along with the abundant fish and wildlife resources of the Tongass were protected while maintaining the availability of some of the Tongass for more intensive resource management in support of the economies of southeast Alaska and its scattered small communities." 
 Congress must approve all declarations of wilderness, which is the highest protection except for a national park or monument. 
Alaska lawmakers and the timber industry were relieved that the administration had refrained from designating more of the Tongass forest as wilderness. Already, 6.6 million acres of the Tongass, an old-growth rain forest, are protected as wilderness. The forest is 16.8 million acres, about the size of West Virginia.
Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, said enough of the Tongass forest was already protected.
"Nearly 97 percent of the forest is fully protected," Mr. Murkowski said. "It is only reasonable that 3 percent be left for multiple use so that Alaskans can have jobs that allow them to live in the region."
Tom Puchlerz, the Tongass forest supervisor, said that only about 10 percent of the nine million acres would be open for development.
"The economic development in our communities in southeast Alaska is important, as are the materials for the nation in terms of timber and minerals," Mr. Puchlerz said.
Environmentalists said the decisions bode poorly for the protection of other wilderness and roadless areas across the country. They said that the recommendation for the 5.5 million-acre Chugach forest protected too little of the forest's accessible land and that the Tongass recommendation was a gift to the timber industry.
The Chugach forest, the nation's second-largest national forest after the Tongass, is southeast of Anchorage and has just 100 miles of roads on the 4.1 million acres that the administration is not seeking to designate as wilderness. The part that would be protected includes forested islands, rugged mountains, extensive ice fields and tidewater glaciers.
Sue Libenson, a spokeswoman for the Alaska Coalition, said the Chugach areas recommended for wilderness designation were remote rocky and glacial parts, mostly unsuitable for economic development anyway.
"We are concerned they will not support wilderness for the areas that are biologically important or accessible to the general public," Ms. Libenson said of the Forest Service.
Administration officials said they were doing better than the Clinton administration on the Chugach forest by recommending any wilderness designation. As for the Tongass forest, they said, they were simply affirming the position of the Clinton administration. 
Environmentalists, however, said the Bush administration was playing a shell game with these terms, noting that the Clinton administration had not reviewed the areas for wilderness designation and had designated parts of the Tongass forest as roadless areas.
Jeremy Anderson, a spokesman for the Southeast Alaska Conservation Council, said: "Clinton said, You can't log or road in these areas, and now the Bush administration is saying, Have at it. They're pushing more than 30 timber sales in these areas."
Mark Rey, under secretary for natural resources and environment in the Agriculture Department, said the Chugach forest recommendation, which is final, was the largest wilderness designation that any administration had sent to Congress since 1984.
The Tongass recommendation is a draft statement from the Forest Service. It will be subject to public comment for 90 days before being proposed as a final rule. Both sides predicted that the matter would be settled in court.
Since the middle of the last century, the timber industry has clear-cut hundreds of thousands of acres of the Tongass's old-growth forest and built more than 4,600 miles of roads.
Ms. Libenson of the Alaska Coalition said the announcement on both the Tongass and Chugach forests was an effort by the Forest Service "to cover a very bad, embarrassing decision on the Tongass with a second-rate decision on the Chugach."
Mr. Rey said the Chugach decision was not meant to distract from or counterbalance the Tongass one, but that since both forests were in Alaska, the recommendations might as well be announced simultaneously.

HEADLINE: Russia and China Called Top Business Bribers 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

 BODY:
When more than 800 business experts in 15 emerging-market countries were asked recently to identify the most flagrant bribe-payers in richer nations seeking contracts, Russian and Chinese companies emerged at the top of the list, according to a report this week from Transparency International, an independent anticorruption organization.
 Speaking at a news conference in Paris on Tuesday, Peter Eigen, chairman of the organization, said that in dealing with emerging-market countries, the Russians and Chinese were "using bribes on an exceptional and intolerable scale." 
 Taiwan and South Korea were close behind, said the survey, conducted for Transparency International by the Gallup International Association.
But perhaps more surprising, in the view of Transparency International, was the perception that anti-bribery laws in the United States and other industrial nations were apparently not deterring bribe-payers from multinational companies based in the West and Japan. 
In the survey, the names of 21 industrial countries were given to business and banking leaders in emerging-market nations for comment and ranking. On a scale of 1 to 10 -- with 1 being the most prone to bribery and 10 the least -- the United States got a score of 5.3, the same rating as Japan. The "cleanest" countries, though not perfect, were Australia, Sweden, Switzerland, Austria and Canada. Singapore, and most companies in Europe, were considered less corrupt than their American counterparts.
Bribing foreigners to gain business has been against the law in the United States since 1977 under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, which groups most industrial countries, introduced a worldwide convention against bribery three years ago. 
Transparency International, whose founders are former World Bank officials, introduced the "bribe payers' index" in 1999 in order to balance its older "corruption perception index." That index routinely cited developing countries as the most corrupt in the eyes of international business analysts.
The reaction from those developing countries often was a countercharge that somebody has to offer or agree to pay bribes for corruption to take place. It was the strong message that Jerry Rawlings, who was president of Ghana, brought to the United Nations in a General Assembly speech two years ago, in which he accused the rich nations of creating the corruption in Africa that they then criticized.
Both indexes from Transparency International measure only the perceptions of those engaged in business around the world who have experience in dealing with bribery and other irregular or illegal transactions. No attempt is made to quantify corruption, which even international organizations like the World Bank or International Monetary Fund find difficult to calculate with certainty.
In its new bribe-payers report, released on Tuesday, Transparency International said the most bribery appeared to take place in the construction and military sectors, where government officials can exert pressure on foreign companies to pay bribes or lose contracts. Agriculture was the least likely economic sector to be affected, the survey found, although it was also not free of bribery. No companies are identified in the new report.
The 835 business experts interviewed between December 2001 and March 2002 by Gallup organizations in emerging market economies were in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, South Africa, South Korea and Thailand. The experts included senior executives in multinational and domestic companies, chartered accountants, chamber of commerce leaders, bankers and lawyers.
In some cases, the countries they represented were both receivers and sellers of goods and services in developing economies. The survey of business leaders found that bribery was also prevalent in domestic transactions in these countries.
Transparency International, based in Berlin and calling itself a coalition against corruption, has chapters in countries around the world and is supported by grants from governments, foundations and corporations. A copy of the index is online at www.transparency.org.

HEADLINE: Police Dept. Reports Jump In Applicants 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

 BODY:
The number of applicants to take the exam to become a city police officer has risen to more than 35,000, nearly three times as many as applied for last June's exam. The Police Department attributes the sharp rise in part to a new system that allows applicants to register on the Internet. 
 About half the applicants, 17,651, used the Internet to file for next month's exam. The department said the large increase would enable it to find replacements for the large number of officers retiring. 
 The surge is a welcome sign for the department for other reasons, as well. The precinct station torture of Abner Louima and the death of Amadou Diallo in a hail of police bullets made it more difficult for the department to attract recruits. The police union's public complaint about low starting salaries also hurt. 
There was some change in recruiting in the aftermath of Sept. 11. The heroic acts of officers vastly improved the department's image, and as the economy dipped after the attack, the prospect of a stable job with a secure pension and benefits package became more attractive.
Those gains were offset, though, as thousands of officers decided to retire after earning large amounts of overtime that sharply increased their pension benefits. (Pension calculations are based on officers' earnings for their last year on the job.) 
Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, alarmed by the retirement rate and disappointed that only 6,000 candidates showed up for a police exam in February, expanded recruitment in other states and on military bases and appointed an assistant chief to supervise recruiting efforts and to report directly to him. 
Allowing applicants to file for the exam online -- at www.nyc.gov/html/nypd /home.html -- is simpler, but it is unclear whether those applicants will be as committed to pursuing a police career as past recruits have been. Before the department's system went online in March, the only way to apply was to get an application -- usually at a police station or a recruiting fair -- fill it out and mail it back with a $35 fee. That fee was rescinded last year in an effort to attract more applicants. 
So next month's exam will measure whether the higher application rate actually produces more officers for a city in need, as well as test whether the department has hit upon a new, cost-effective way of expanding the recruitment pool.
Even with the recruiting problems, the number of applicants had slowly crept up over the last two years. Altogether, 8,617 signed up for the May 2000 exam, 12,122 for the December 2000 exam, and 12,929 for the exam the following June. The number dropped again early this year while the department continued to hemorrhage officers, at so fast a rate that today, it is left with 37,465 officers, the lowest level in five years. Its highest level was 40,710.
The increase in applicants is only one sign of a renewed interest in law enforcement careers, police officials said. In the last two months, 1,979 other people have taken the test at walk-in locations around the country, including 373 who took it May 11 at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.
At that forum, police recruiters had to turn away more than 700 people because there were not enough seats; most of the applicants were not students but local residents in need of work. Fifty-nine people signed up for the June test in a recruiting drive at Columbia, 29 applied at Yale, and 78 applied at New York University.
What remains an open question, however, is how many of the 35,689 people who have signed up this time -- the highest number since 57,888 applied in 1993 -- will actually show up when the three-hour exam is given June 8 at about a dozen city high schools.
In prior years, only about half of those who had applied showed up on test day. Of those, about 75 percent got a passing grade of 70 or better. Only 1 in 10 of those who pass are found suitable to hire. Many are rejected because they cannot meet the educational criteria -- at least 60 college credits are required -- or do not meet the standards for physical or psychological fitness.
About a quarter of the online applications have come from other states and from many foreign countries, including Canada (25), Australia (7), and France, Italy and Ireland (2 each). Clearly, many of those applicants will not make a long and expensive trip to New York.
Even if only half the 35,000 applicants arrive on test day, it would be the largest number to take the exam in nearly a decade. If past trends hold, that could provide a pool of nearly 1,800 recruits, said Chief Rafael Pineiro, who was the assistant chief appointed by Mr. Kelly to take charge of recruitment and who has since been promoted to chief of personnel.
Some in the police union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, said the high number of applicants was short of what was needed because the pay scale is driving hundreds of officers out before retirement age. Some skeptics, for example, have criticized the department's efforts to recruit at elite universities because, they say, such college graduates could earn far more than the $31,305 annual starting salary for a city police officer. 
"What good is spending money to recruit and to train, only to have the successful candidates leave for the first better-paying job that becomes available?" said the union president, Patrick J. Lynch, through a spokesman. "That money would be better used to pay New York City police officers a salary that will keep them at the N.Y.P.D. Otherwise, New York City has become the nation's job fair for police officers."
In part because of the Internet, however, the current recruitment drive cost $2.8 million, when other, far less successful campaigns cost $10 million. 
Nearly 60 percent of the current applicants are members of minorities, who have typically had more college credits than white recruits. That higher educational level, Mr. Kelly said, undermined any notion that the department might have to lower its standards to attract minority candidates. 
Alexander S. Ford, the chief executive of PoliceOne, a law enforcement technology company in San Francisco, said that very few police departments have Internet recruitment systems, though some allow Internet users to print an application form and mail it in. 
Saying the New York department was ahead of the trend, he said he was working with the police in San Francisco and Oakland in developing a system to allow Internet users to file applications online and to communicate with the departments electronically.
Thomas M. Sharkey, a doctoral student at Columbia who signed up for the police exam after he was laid off from a job in private business in December, said that despite the low starting pay, he was one of many young people with a newfound sense of public service after witnessing the heroism police officers showed on Sept. 11.
"I guess the pay is not a lot to start out," said Mr. Sharkey, 31. "But what is more important to me, and especially since 9/11, is a sense that I want to contribute to other people, and that I have a civic responsibility to help others."

HEADLINE: Lindh Lawyers Claim 'Selective Prosecution' 

BYLINE:  By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16 

 BODY:
In another novel legal argument, lawyers for John Walker Lindh, the Californian accused of fighting alongside the Taliban, said today that the government was using "selective prosecution" in indicting him but taking no action against others who have conducted business with or worked on behalf of the former Afghanistan regime.
 One of those, the defense lawyers said, is Laili Helms, the niece of Richard Helms, the former director of central intelligence, who was born in Afghanistan and until the Sept. 11 attacks was "the Taliban's unofficial envoy to the United States." 
 In 2 of the 10 counts against him, Mr. Lindh is charged with "supplying services to the Taliban" and conspiracy to do so. 
But his lawyers argue that the statute on which the government is basing its claim applies only to commercial and financial transactions. 
They say Mr. Lindh had been singled out for prosecution only because he was exercising his right to practice whatever religion he chose and to associate with whomever he wanted.
Moreover, they said Mr. Lindh could not get a fair trial in Virginia because of its proximity to the Pentagon, where a hijacked plane crashed on Sept. 11, and because of repeated statements by government officials that have "poisoned the atmosphere" against their client. 
They asked the judge to dismiss the case or at a minimum transfer it.
The defense, seeking an additional hearing on the matter of selective prosecution, made these arguments in papers filed today in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The prosecution is to respond to these papers in its own court filings.
The argument about selective prosecution was novel insofar as it relates to the Taliban.
Basing its assertions on newspaper articles, the defense said that a telephone company, based in Parsippany, N.J., won a $240 million contract to build a wireless telephone system for Afghanistan and began work on it in May 1999. In July 1999, in the International Economic Emergency Powers Act, President Bill Clinton barred transactions with the Taliban. At that point, one of the company's officers said he would disregard the sanctions and move the company out of the United States.
The defense also said that Unocal, an American oil company, pursued its business interests in Afghanistan after the ban. Unocal officials said they abandoned the project long before the sanctions, but defense lawyers cite later articles asserting continuing contact about the pipeline with the Bush administration.
In another instance, the defense cites Ms. Helms, who is the granddaughter of a former Afghan minister. In an article in The Village Voice before Sept. 11, she talked about her services to the Taliban, saying she "patches together conference calls between the Taliban leadership and State Department officials," paying $1,000 for one of those calls from her own pocket. 
Finally, the defense cites the case of Abdul Hakim Mohahid, who was sent to New York in January 1997 as the Taliban's envoy to the United Nations. He did not have a seat with the international body but operated from an office in Queens.
Again quoting newspaper articles, the defense lawyers said that he was not asked to leave after sanctions were imposed. 
Mr. Lindh, his lawyers said, "is apparently the first and only person to have been prosecuted" under the regulations that imposed the sanctions, "despite evidence that several other individuals and organizations have engaged in activities in violation of the same prohibitions." They also said the prosecution never described what services Mr. Lindh is alleged to have provided the Taliban.

HEADLINE: Home Building Was Off in April 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16 

 BODY:
The construction of new homes fell in April to the lowest level in six months and the number of workers seeking unemployment benefits rose unexpectedly last week, two reports released today showed, pointing to a moderating economic expansion.
 Builders started work at an annual rate of 1.56 million homes last month, down 5.4 percent from March, for the slowest pace since October, the Commerce Department said. 
Initial unemployment claims increased to 418,000 last week, and the number of people drawing benefits earlier this month, 3.9 million, was the highest in almost two decades, the Labor Department said. 
 "It will take some time for vigorous growth to extend to all industries and regions of the nation," said Michael Moskow, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, in a speech today.
The employment report reinforces the concern of central bankers that businesses are skeptical about increasing investment and hiring.
April is the first month this year that housing starts have fallen below a pace of 1.6 million units. They surged past 1.7 million in January and February, helped by mild weather and low interest rates, and fell to 1.64 million in March.
Analysts had expected the number of starts to drop in April to 1.625 million, based on the median of 58 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. Starts for single-family homes decreased 2 percent in April, to a rate of 1.27 million units. Starts for multifamily homes plunged 18.1 percent in April, to a 285,000 annual rate.
By region, starts fell 19.5 percent in the Midwest, to an annual pace of 276,000; 5.8 percent in the West, to 377,000; and 24.1 percent in the Northeast, to 126,000. Starts rose 5.6 percent in the South, to 776,000.

HEADLINE: The Big City; 
Waterfront Could Still Be a Contender

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY 

 BODY:
IF you wanted an analysis of New York's decrepit waterfront, on Wednesday you had a choice. You could either listen to the governor of New Jersey deliver the keynote address at the Waterfront 2002 Conference, or you could go cruising on a catboat with William Kornblum. 
 It wasn't all that hard a choice, especially if you knew Dr. Kornblum's curriculum vitae. He is an expert in decrepitude on and off the waterfront. As a sociologist at the City University of New York Graduate Center, two decades ago he led a research team that meticulously documented the old Times Square. The social scientists analyzed where drug sales took place. They watched kung-fu movies and peep shows. They monitored pimps' favorite bars and drew maps of prostitutes' strolls. It was the kind of sociological research you could talk about at cocktail parties without anyone's eyes glazing over. 
 When he was not immersed in vice at the center of Manhattan, Dr. Kornblum was out sailing New York's waterways in his small catboat, a 24-foot fishing boat. It nearly ended up on the bottom of the harbor a few times, but it survived long enough for him to write "At Sea in the City: New York From the Water's Edge," just published by Algonquin Books. It's an exploration of New York's greatest natural resource, which is remarkably unfamiliar to its inhabitants. 
As he cruised along the shores of Brooklyn and Manhattan, Dr. Kornblum pointed out what wasn't there: people. "So much of the waterfront remains underused," he said. "It's hard for an average family to get to the water. There are thousands of sailors at the edge of the city, across the line in the suburbs, but they regard the waters of New York as dirty, industrial, inhospitable -- a place to get through on their way somewhere else."
Go to Baltimore or, better, Sydney, Australia, and you'll see a harbor filled with boats ferrying tourists and residents from one attraction to another. Why is our waterfront property abandoned? Why, until a company from Sydney proposed it recently, didn't anyone in New York try letting people climb the Brooklyn Bridge? 
New York's regulatory morass is often blamed for the moribund waterfront, but there are plenty of regulations in Sydney, too. It took nine years (and overcoming 62 bureaucratic objections) to get permission for tourists to climb Sydney's Harbor Bridge. 
New York's chief problem may simply be its size: too much waterfront, too many distractions. Baltimore and Sydney are smaller cities whose identities and economies depend on their harbors, so politicians pay attention to the waterfront. So do politicians in Jersey City, where old railroad yards have recently been turned into a thriving community.
Across the water, meanwhile, there are empty lots and buildings in Brooklyn. Manhattan has barely managed to build a bike path and a few parks. Boaters have a hard time landing. If the Upper West Side were a separate town (or People's Republic), it would probably never have allowed the 79th Street Boat Basin to be converted from a recreational marina into a subsidized residential community. A small town wouldn't want its waterfront taken over by a bunch of permanent squatters whose "boats" never leave the dock, but the problem isn't big enough to matter at City Hall.
IF Astoria or Staten Island were separate towns, there might already be tourists clambering atop the Hell Gate Bridge (the railroad span next to the Triborough Bridge) and the Bayonne Bridge, which are steel-arch bridges quite similar to Sydney's Harbor Bridge. (In fact, the Bayonne Bridge to Staten Island is slightly longer.) But city officials have had too many other concerns, like persuading tourists to visit Times Square.
"Times Square got attention from the city's powerful actors because theater owners feared for their survival," Dr. Kornblum said. "Now you've got an increasing coalition of neighborhood groups and community activists trying to do something about the waterfront, and they're attracting some attention. But it's easier to focus on a specific place like Times Square than to develop initiatives for a 500-mile waterfront."
What could the waterfront look like 20 years from now? "In a lot of areas there probably won't be much improvement," Dr. Kornblum said, "but we could see changes in places like the Gowanus Canal and Governor's Island and Newtown Creek. Parts of New York City could have very, very active river life, somewhat like Venice."
Venice on the Gowanus? It's hard to imagine, but then, 20 years ago, so was Disney in Times Square.

HEADLINE: America's Poor Standards 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
On Tuesday Standard & Poor's, the private bond rating agency, announced that it would do something unprecedented: It will try to impose accounting standards substantially stricter than those required by the federal government. Instead of taking corporate reports at face value, S.&P. will correct the numbers to eliminate what it considers the inappropriate treatment of "one-time" expenses, pension fund earnings and, above all, stock options -- a major part of executive compensation that, according to federal standards, somehow isn't a business expense. S.&P.'s estimate of "core earnings" for the 500 largest companies slashes reported profits by an astonishing 25 percent.
 Why does S.&P. -- along with Warren Buffett, Alan Greenspan and just about every serious financial economist -- think that current accounting standards require a drastic overhaul? And if such an overhaul is needed, why doesn't the government do it? Why does S.&P. think that it must do the job itself? 
 To see the absurdity of the current rules, consider stock options. An executive is given the right to purchase shares of the company's stock, at a fixed price, some time in the future. If the stock rises, he buys at bargain prices. If the stock falls, he doesn't exercise the option. At worst, he loses nothing; at best, he makes a lot of money. Nice work if you can get it. 
Yet according to federal accounting standards, such deals don't cost employers anything, as long as the guaranteed price isn't below the market price on the day the option is granted. Of course, this ignores the "heads I win, tails you lose" aspect: executives get a share of investors' gains if things go well, but don't share the losses if things go badly. In fact, companies literally apply a double standard: they deduct the cost of options from taxable income, even while denying that they cost anything in their profit statements.
So how could it possibly make sense not to count options as a cost? Defenders of the current system argue that stock options align the interests of executives with those of investors. Even if that were true, however, it wouldn't justify ignoring the cost -- no more than it would make sense to deny that wages, which provide incentives to workers, are a business expense. Furthermore, it's now clear that stock options, far from reliably inducing executives to serve shareholders, often create perverse incentives. At worst, they handsomely reward managers who run their companies as pump-and-dump schemes; executives at Enron and many other companies got rich thanks to stock prices that soared before they collapsed. 
Options are only part of an accounting system in deep trouble. As David Blitzer, S.&P.'s chief investment strategist, recently wrote, "Financial markets are as much a social contract as is democratic government." Yet there is a growing sense that this contract is being broken, undermining the trust that is so essential to the operation of financial markets. Clearly, major reforms are needed. And bear in mind that this isn't a left-right issue; it's about protecting investors -- middle-class and wealthy alike -- from exploitation by self-dealing insiders. So who could possibly be opposed? You'd be surprised.
Harvey Pitt, the accounting-industry lawyer who heads the Securities and Exchange Commission, has clearly been dragging his feet on reform. And his boss, George W. Bush, has declared himself opposed to treating stock options as a business expense. Wouldn't it be nice, just once, to see the Bush administration oppose the interests of a privileged elite? 
But the administration is not alone in its foot-dragging. In fact, perhaps the biggest foot-dragger of all is Senator Joseph Lieberman. Way back in 1994 Mr. Lieberman gave crucial aid to lobbyists trying to head off new accounting standards, which would have forced companies to recognize the cost of options; now he is once again defending the status quo, urging his colleagues to go slow.
Some politicians do see the problem; John McCain and Carl Levin have introduced legislation to reform America's accounting standards. But it seems unlikely that government will fix our dysfunctional accounting rules anytime soon.
Mr. Blitzer of S.&P. points out that in previous periods of corporate scandal, "legislators and prosecutors took the lead in tackling public concerns over the market." It is a sad commentary on our leadership that this time he feels that he must do the job himself.

HEADLINE: Budget in Albany Has Few Cuts But Relies on One-Time Revenue 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 16 

 BODY:
While states around the country are reducing spending, New York lawmakers today approved an $89.6 billion budget that sidesteps cuts in services by relying heavily on one-time revenues and nearly exhausting the state's reserves.
 As they debated the bills, several lawmakers said that Gov. George E. Pataki and legislative leaders were betting that the regional economy and the stock market would improve enough to save them from ugly cutbacks or tax increases next year. 
 The spending plan, which passed overwhelmingly today, comes at a time when a recession, worsened by the effect of the terrorist attacks, has forced the majority of states to cut spending, defer tax refunds and take other drastic measures. Senator Joseph L. Bruno, the leader of New York's Republican Senate majority, said that the lawmakers had "truly worked a miracle." 
But other lawmakers said the effect was more akin to a mirage. The plan leaves the state with a bare $710 million in reserves at the end of the fiscal year, next March 31. It also uses about $3.1 billion in revenue that will not be available next year and adds $900 million in debt.
"There are a lot of fingers being crossed that the assumptions used in this budget don't lead us to come back later in the year to cut back on our commitments," Assemblyman Alexander B. Pete Grannis, a Manhattan Democrat, said.
Some Democrats said they would have preferred to have raised income taxes temporarily rather than rely on what they characterized as fiscal gimmicks. The Republican governor, however, dug in his heels in negotiations and refused to raise income or business taxes.
Mr. Pataki, who said he would approve the budget, has argued that it is the right time to spend the savings the state has built up over the last five years to make it through a tough economic time. He and the Senate Republicans predict the budget will stimulate the economy by providing $600 million in seed money for high-tech industries and expanding tax breaks for upstate businesses. They say that tax collections will then grow.
"We did what few other states did, and that was to put away money for a rainy day," Mr. Pataki's chief spokesman, Michael McKeon, said. "We are ready to weather this storm without massive cutbacks you see all over the country."
All told, the budget raises spending about 6 percent, though the portion paid through state taxes and fees will go up only 3 percent. It also imposes some new taxes and increases a number of obscure fees to bring in about $85 million more. The tax on cellular telephones, for instance, will rise to $1.20 a month from 70 cents to get $38 million. Hunting and fishing fees will be raised to generate about $6 million more.
The budget also counts on reducing the state work force by at least 5,000 through incentives for early retirement and a hiring freeze.
The governor and lawmakers also agreed to shift many costs from the state to the federal government. College scholarships, for instance, will be financed with $380 million from a surplus of federal welfare money that the state has built up since 1996 as people have left the rolls. Using welfare money for scholarships is particularly ironic since, under new rules, welfare recipients are required to work, making it virtually impossible for them to go to college, advocates for the poor said.
"The money can go to college, but the people can't," said Michael Kink, a lobbyist for Housing Works, an antipoverty group. "They are basically just using it to plug a hole."
The Legislature is also raiding special funds for the environment and health care to get $400 million for general purposes. Another $150 million will be taken from the state mortgage agency accounts.
State Comptroller H. Carl McCall, a Democrat running for governor this year, sharply criticized the use of one-shot revenues, new debt and raids on dedicated funds.
"At a time when we need strong leadership and new approaches from the governor, we are getting a budget that relies on the types of gimmicks that left New York lagging behind other states during the boom times," Mr. McCall said. Mr. McKeon dismissed Mr. McCall's criticism as a partisan attack.
While Mr. McCall stopped short of calling for an increase in taxes to raise revenues, some Democrats said the state's financial condition warranted new levies. "There is not enough money in this budget to pay for the programs we are funding," Senator Eric T. Schneiderman said during the floor debate. "Let's tell our constituents the truth: we have to raise revenues."
For most of the lawmakers, the most important slice of the budget is state aid to local schools. The final budget raises the state aid to local districts by $420 million over last year's total, despite the governor's initial proposal to freeze aid. The state will spend a total $14.6 billion on schools this year under the budget passed today.
New York City will receive at least $163 million of the increase in school operating aid, though the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, has promised to raise that figure to $200 million through the use of funds under his control.
But the city schools will also get a one-time infusion of about $200 million to reimburse the city for school programs it paid for in past years. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said the extra $400 million would allow the city to limit cuts to the city's education budget.
The budget does not include other revenues Mayor Bloomberg requested, like the authority to raise the city's cigarette taxes and parking fines. Nor does it grant the mayor control over the city schools. Those issues will be dealt with in a separate bill next week, aides to Mr. Silver said.
There were some small surprises hidden in the voluminous budget documents. The state has agreed to extend the franchise of the New York Racing Association, a nonprofit organization that operates the state's premier thoroughbred tracks. The franchise will be extended for an extra five years, to 2012, and the state is providing financing to help it install video lottery machines at Aqueduct Raceway in Queens.
A few new programs are being born as well. For the first time, the state will provide $5 million to directly combat AIDS in black and Latino neighborhoods, where 9 out of 10 new infections now occur.
Even with the uncertainty surrounding future revenue, lawmakers did not cut back on the pool of money they get each year to spend as they choose in their districts. Each house will receive $85 million for what are known as member items and the governor will receive $30 million.
The budget passed 46 days late, but no budget has been passed on time for 18 years. In a break with tradition, the leaders did not hold an all-night session and force tired legislators to vote on bills they had barely read. Several lawmakers congratulated themselves on having passed the budget in daylight, as if it were a significant achievement.
Most Assembly members received the first batch of bills -- a stack of paper 10 inches thick held together with rubber bands -- at 8 a.m. The debate on those measures began two hours later. A second batch of bills was delivered in the late afternoon. The lower house finished passing the bills at 4:35 p.m., and the Senate finished voting a half-hour later.
Most of the lawmakers left in high spirits, but a few expressed worries about the economic assumptions underlying the budget.
Pataki administration officials said the steep drop-off in tax collections in April, which opened a $1.2 billion hole in the state's spending plan, had caught them off guard, as many partners in small companies paid far less income tax than anticipated.
Budget officials predict that income tax revenue will shrink slightly this year after falling 4.5 percent in the last fiscal year. One reason is that the stock market, which drives much of the income tax revenue in the state, is not expected to return to its 2000 apex.

HEADLINE: Energy Trades Echoed In Broadband Market 

BYLINE:  By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, May 16 

 BODY:
Big energy trading companies engaged in scores of transactions aimed at creating the appearance of activity as they tried to build a market for trading high-speed communications capacity, according to records and interviews with former employees and executives at the companies.
 The companies -- led by Aquila, El Paso Energy Partners, Enron and Reliant Resources -- made the trades in late 2000 and 2001, as the Internet bubble peaked and they sought to sell Wall Street on the idea that a fast-growing communications market was emerging. The energy traders were also trying to persuade telecommunications companies to do business with them. 
 In the last week, the shares of energy traders have been driven down as several, including Reliant and Dynegy, acknowledged that they engaged in round-trip trades of electricity. Federal regulators have said that the trading practices could have sent false price signals and eroded the credibility of deregulated markets. 
The energy companies hoped to build a big business in the so-called broadband market, where telephone companies and Internet service providers buy capacity to send high-speed transmissions over advanced fiber optic networks. The market's promise helped drive the shares of the energy traders to their peaks last year. But even some analysts who gave the broadband business multibillion-dollar valuations a year ago said that they now doubted whether an active market ever developed. 
"Everybody knew they were all trading with each other," said Anatol Feygin, an analyst at J. P. Morgan Securities in New York. "They were working off the premise that this was the same way electricity got started."
As the energy companies struggled to attract broadband business, the records show that they repeatedly sold the same routes to each other at the same price on the same day. Reliant, for example, engaged in more than 50 round-trip same-day trades from April to October of last year, trading records from the company show. 
"The same circuit got traded back and forth," said a former Reliant executive who worked with the company's trading unit. "The idea was to book more transactions and get a market going."
The energy companies denied that they were party to any questionable transactions. "We absolutely did not engage in round-trip trades," said Norma Dunn, a spokeswoman at El Paso Energy, which is based in Houston. "The trades go through a broker so you don't know who you're dealing with."
Richard Wheatley, a spokesman for Reliant Energy, the parent of Reliant Resources, said: "We never undertook any wash trades in bandwidth. We never engage in wash trades." 
An Aquila spokeswoman, Mary Amundsen, said the company did not engage in round-trip trades; an Enron spokesman declined to comment. Dynegy could not be reached for comment last night.
The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation have been examining swaps of broadband capacity involving Global Crossing, Qwest Communications and other telecommunications companies. With those firms, accounting questions have been raised, including whether revenues were booked on round-trip trades. 
Likewise, Enron's trading, which ranged beyond power and broadband to include commodities, is part of broad criminal and regulatory investigations. The broadband trading volumes and revenues of other energy companies were much smaller than Enron's or those of the telecommunications companies.
Now, the broadband marketplace has largely collapsed, and the energy companies have closed their broadband trading operations.
But little more than a year ago, these energy traders were investing heavily in fiber optic networks. The companies were following Enron, which had estimated that it would generate $17 billion in revenue from the broadband market by 2005, according to a February 2000 report by J. P. Morgan Securities.
One Wall Street energy analyst, who asked not to be identified for fear of inviting the attention of regulators, said, "They all promoted it, but only Enron quantified it."
Several employees who were identified in trading documents, but spoke only on the condition that they not be named, disputed the suggestion that they engaged in round-trip trades. They said that there were no prearranged deals and no effort to increase trading activity artificially.
"I know these look suspicious, but I'm telling you they are not," a trader said. "These are normal trades."
But several employees who worked in the Enron trading group said that traders from the different companies sometimes met for lunch and that some of them kept charts near their desk with their production goals -- the numbers needed to impress Wall Street.
Another former Enron employee said, "This is about: 'Let's get trading volume going.' They wanted to create a market faster than they created gas and power."
Two former Enron broadband executives and one former Reliant executive also said in interviews that there was pressure to trade simply to inflate volumes. 
One veteran of the broadband market, Brent Wilkins, a managing director at Cantor Fitzgerald Telecom Services, said that when he was evaluating the broadband market, several energy companies that were considering the market were skeptical of the companies already in it.
"They didn't want to participate. They called it DS3 Bingo," said Mr. Wilkins, referring to trading in the high-capacity lines. "There was no money there."
Former Enron and Reliant officials who insisted on anonymity, said that the trading was so lethargic at times that traders felt pressed to do round-trip trades, or sometimes even to trade at a loss. 
Still, Enron and analysts valued the broadband division last year at about $25 a share, or about $20 billion. Amid the Internet mania, such figures spurred other energy companies to jump into broadband, though none was as aggressive as Enron in its wooing of investors. At a presentation to investment analysts early last year, Enron said that its transaction volume had jumped from 3 broadband trades in the first quarter of 2000 to 581 trades in the first quarter of 2001.
But Enron could not meet its goals for the broadband unit. A deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies over Enron's fiber optic lines fell apart. Enron sold a part of its unusedfiber to LJM2, an off-balance-sheet partnership controlled by Andrew S. Fastow, then the company's chief financial officer, in a transaction executives later said was intended to help meet earnings expectations. 
The energy industry's broadband trades were criticized in December by William S. Lerach, the lead lawyer in a shareholder class-action lawsuit against Enron. "There were only 20 legitimate broadband trades. Everything else was just a dark swap," he said in a federal court hearing in Houston, referring to trades of surplus, unlighted optic cable.
Mr. Lerach named Reliant, El Paso, Level 3 Communications and Qwest as having engaged in trades meant to impress Wall Street by inflating broadband volume. But he offered no evidence, and his remarks were disputed by those companies.
In interviews this week, El Paso executives said that broadband trading was never a core business and that the company realized about $2 million in revenue before it dropped out of broadband trading in January. The goal of its trading unit was not to make a profit, but to "test the market to see if there were other interested parties out there," said Ms. Dunn, the El Paso spokeswoman.
Reliant officials said that company's broadband unit generated only about $1 million in revenue. Mr. Wheatley, the Reliant spokesman, said that the company quit the market because of a lack of participation by others. "Let's just say it wasn't a lucrative business," he said. --------------------

Top Managers Resign
HOUSTON, May 16 (Reuters) -- Top executives resigned at Reliant Resources and CMS Energy today after the companies admitted to taking part in bogus trading deals to pump up their energy business.
The executives are the highest-level casualties of the meltdown in the energy marketing and trading sector since the management shake-up at Enron after it collapsed.
Reliant Resources said two executives in its energy trading operations -- Joe Bob Perkins, executive vice president for wholesale businesses; and Shahid Malik, president of marketing and trading -- had resigned.
CMS said Tamela Pallas, chief executive for marketing and trading, had resigned.

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day yesterday about trades made by energy companies as they sought to develop a market in high-speed communications capacity misidentified one company. It is the El Paso Corporation, not El Paso Energy Partners, a limited partnership with ties to El Paso.
A chart with the article, listing transactions in which Reliant Resources traded capacity with other companies in two directions in a single day at a single price included one trade with Aquila erroneously. There was no such trade on April 5, 2001; thus the total number between Reliant and Aquila from December 2000 through October 2001 was 11.
A chart in Business Day last Friday with an article about trades by energy companies that sought to develop a market in high-speed communications capacity misstated the number of trades made in two directions on the same day at identical prices by Reliant Resources with each of two other companies -- Enron and Aquila. And a correction in this space on Saturday again misstated the Aquila figure. From December 2000 through October 2001, Reliant had 18 such trades with Enron not 19. Reliant had 5 with Aquila over the same period, not 12 or 11.

HEADLINE: Utility Board Votes to Restart a Nuclear Reactor in Alabama That Has Been Idle Since 1985 

BYLINE:  By DAVID FIRESTONE 

DATELINE: ATLANTA, May 16 

 BODY:
The board of the Tennessee Valley Authority voted today to spend $1.7 billion to restart a troubled nuclear reactor at its Browns Ferry plant in northern Alabama, a decision that could produce the first substantial increase in the nation's nuclear-generating capacity in more than a decade.
 The three reactors at Browns Ferry, on the Tennessee River near Athens, Ala., were shut down in 1985 after engineers discovered that they did not precisely match their blueprints. Even before then, the plant had a history of operating problems caused by a fire in 1975. After corrections were made, the authority restarted the second and third reactor units in 1991 and 1996. 
 The first reactor was left idle because its capacity was not needed, but board members said today that with electricity demand growing, they needed a generator that would not add to the region's air quality problems.
"We must balance the responsibility to provide power to meet future needs with our objectives of protecting the environment and continuing the trend of debt reduction," said Skila Harris, one of the authority's three board members, who was an assistant to former Vice President Al Gore. "Restarting Unit 1 will provide needed generating capacity without increasing air emissions."
The unanimous vote came over the objections of several area residents, who said the plant was insufficiently protected against a terrorist attack, and from environmental groups expressing concern about the reactor's design.
"They're taking an old nuclear reactor that has not operated for 17 years, and they're going to run it longer and harder than it was designed for," said Stephen Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, based in Knoxville, Tenn. "It originally had a design life of 40 years, which they want to extend for 20 years, and they want to force it to produce 1,300 megawatts when it was designed for 1,000. It's a prescription for a serious problem."
There has been no new construction of a nuclear plant since the Three Mile Island accident in 1979; the last nuclear plant to begin operation was the Tennessee Valley Authority's Watts Bar reactor in eastern Tennessee, which began full operation in 1996. The Bush administration, however, has expressed renewed interest in pursuing the technology, as have some large utilities.
An operating license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission would be required before the reactor could be restarted. No other approval is needed for the authority to prepare the plant for reopening. T.V.A. officials said they hoped to pay for the work from the annual revenues of the authority's system.
When the Browns Ferry plant was completed in 1977, it was the largest nuclear power plant in the world, the first to generate more than a billion watts of electricity. It uses boiling-water reactors, an older technology than the pressurized-water reactors that are in newer nuclear plants. The T.V.A. is not planning to change the fundamental design of the plant, leading some critics to suggest that it is spending too much money on antiquated technology.
"For the same amount of money, they could build a brand-new reactor that's safer and has a longer life," said David Lochbaum, a nuclear-safety engineer for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a group often opposed to nuclear-plant expansion. "It's like trying to dust off an eight-track tape player rather than buying a DVD system -- they're not getting good value for their money."
No nuclear plant has ever been restarted after such a long period in mothballs, Mr. Lochbaum added.
Authority officials disagreed with that analysis. Gil Francis, a T.V.A. spokesman, said the authority had looked at every option available for meeting power demands by 2010 and concluded that it was less expensive and cleaner to restart the reactor than to build one, or to add to the authority's battery of coal, gas and hydroelectric plants.
"Every option had its pros and cons," Mr. Francis said. "Coal plants have emission issues and high capital costs; gas-fired plants have the volatility in the price of fuel. But considering the economies of scale of having the existing reactors nearby, we think restarting this reactor will return its investment in eight years of operation."
The upgraded plant, which would be ready for operation by 2006, would add the latest technology to the reactor, Mr. Francis said. 
Most elected officials in the region support the T.V.A.'s action, which would create 2,400 jobs, and several union leaders gave their enthusiastic approval to the plan at today's hearing. Representative Zach Wamp, a Republican who represents the Chattanooga area, said it was hypocritical of environmental groups to oppose a generating technology that does not add to air pollution.
"There's a great debate in the Tennessee Valley over the degraded air quality in the Smokies and around the valley, and how much the T.V.A. plants contribute to it," Mr. Wamp said. "Well, clearly if you want cleaner air, the development of more nuclear reactors is the way to go, and Browns Ferry 1 is the logical place to start. You can't have it both ways."
Environmental leaders, however, said the problem of nuclear waste disposal had still not been resolved and suggested that the authority would be better off spending the $1.7 billion cleaning up the fossil-fuel plants that are now operating.
The T.V.A. is the nation's largest public producer of electricity, serving about 8.3 million people in seven states. About two-thirds of its power comes from 11 fossil-fuel plants, while most of the rest comes from three nuclear plants and 29 hydroelectric dams.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: Unemployment Inches Up 

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton (NYT) (Compiled by Yilu Zhao) 

 BODY:
 New York City's jobless rate continued to climb in April, rising to 7.7 percent from 7.5 percent in March, the New York State Department of Labor announced yesterday. The unemployment rate in the city has risen by 2.4 percentage points since March 2001, and is now the highest since November 1998. Excluding the city and its suburbs, New York State's unemployment rate edged up to 5 percent from 4.9 percent. Both the city and state increases were smaller than the national rate, which climbed 0.3 percentage points in April, to 6 percent.

HEADLINE: Betting on the Luxury Goods Market 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: MILAN, May 16 

 BODY:
Is the luxury goods market turning around? Patrizio Bertelli is betting on it.
 Mr. Bertelli announced today that Prada, the multibrand conglomerate he owns with his wife, the designer Miuccia Prada, will offer shares on the Milan stock exchange by the end of the summer, market conditions permitting. 
 Mr. Bertelli said at a news conference that because Prada was the only major luxury goods group not publicly traded, it lacked some of the economic power its rivals enjoyed. "Not to be quoted would mean not competing with them in our capacity to invest," he said. 
Mr. Bertelli is not alone in discerning an industry revival. "The sector is doing very well," said Sagrario Maceira de Rosen, who follows luxury goods at J. P. Morgan Securities. Consumer spending on Gucci bags, Tiffany watches and other luxury goods is picking up, even if consumers are sticking to the lower-ticket items in the category rather than big purchases, she said.
Schroder Salomon Smith Barney said in a recent report that April sales were particularly good in the United States, improving on a trend set in February and March. Executives at LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, the market leader, said this week that they expected operating profit to grow more than 10 percent this year, in contrast to a 20 percent drop in 2001 largely because of the Sept. 11 attacks. Some analysts say the company could manage a 30 percent rise in operating profit.
Still, there are hitches. Tourism is reviving only fitfully from its post-Sept. 11 slump, and many luxury goods groups rely heavily on sales to tourists, notably from Japan. So far this year, Japanese tourism in Europe is down 16 percent compared with the period in 2001, according to Doriana Russo, an analyst at Schroder Salomon Smith Barney. Flagging travel by Americans was cited by Bulgari recently as a cause of lackluster sales of some of its products. While tourism was generally mending, Ms. Russo said, "southern Europe is affected by the Middle East."
Mr. Bertelli, bound by stock market disclosure rules, said he could not comment now on Prada's prospects for this year. But Prada needs cash to pay down debt that totaled 972 million euros ($887 million) at the end of last year and has climbed since then to 1.2 billion euros ($1.1 billion).
Prada borrowed heavily to acquire controlling stakes in a wide range of luxury goods companies, including Jil Sander, Helmut Lang and the Genny Group; it also bought a stake in Fendi that it later sold to LVMH. Moreover, 2001 was not a bright year for Prada. Net income fell to 24 million euros ($22 million) from 94 million euros ($86 million) the year before, on revenue that rose 5.4 percent to 1.72 billion euros ($1.57 billion), largely because of acquisitions; the core brands, Prada and Miu Miu, showed only 2.1 percent revenue growth.
Mr. Bertelli would not say how much of the company Prada would sell in its offering, but it is expected to be about 30 percent, either in new shares or from those now held by Mr. Bertelli, Ms. Prada and her family, who together control 97 percent of the company.
Prada's offering, organized by Deutsche Bank, BNP Paribas and Intesa, is being watched closely as a gauge of investor appetite. In the last month, three European companies, including Punch Taverns, a major British pub-operating company controlled by the Texas Pacific Group, have canceled initial public offerings. Punch called off its $365 million share sale late Wednesday for want of investor interest.
Prada's competitors remain wary about the near future. Gucci, in an advisory in March, said the first half of the year would be relatively difficult. The problem is not in big markets like New York, which depend on local clientele, but in places like Hawaii and Las Vegas that survive on tourism, according to Tomaso Galli, Gucci's spokesman. "Everybody is looking for second-half growth," he said.
Analysts note, too, that tourists tend to buy items like perfumes, accessories and leather goods like wallets on impulse, making the companies that supply those items especially vulnerable. Mr. Bertelli said Prada relied on apparel for only one-third of revenue, and got 55 percent from accessories, leather goods and items like sunglasses.
But he also stressed Prada's success in weaning itself from dependence on Japanese tourists. In Europe, they supplied 8 percent of total sales last year, down from 26 percent in 1999; in the United States, they supplied just 3 percent last year.
Still, Riccardo Stilli, Prada's chief financial officer, attributed last year's poor profitability in part to the company's heavy investment in new stores, like the lavish store designed by Rem Koolhaas in the SoHo neighborhood of Manhattan. Mr. Bertelli said that investment was paying off, with gross receipts at the SoHo store averaging $54,000 a day since it opened in December and $75,000 a day in the last two months. "And it has not taken sales from our other stores," he said.

HEADLINE: State Dept. Report Investigating Arafat's Links to Terror Is at Odds With Israeli Claims 

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16 

 BODY:
A new State Department report has found "no conclusive evidence" that Yasir Arafat or other senior Palestinian leaders planned or approved specific terrorist attacks on Israel in the six months that ended in December, an assertion sharply at odds with recent Israeli claims.
 But the report, sent to Congress last week, said "the weight of evidence" suggests that Palestinian leaders knew their subordinates were involved in violence and "did little to rein them in" or punish them. It also noted that senior Palestinian officials were involved in an unsuccessful effort to smuggle sophisticated weapons into the West Bank and Gaza that "could have dramatically escalated the level of Palestinian violence." 
 The semiannual report, required by law, does not cover the most intense period of Palestinian violence and Israeli raids and reprisals of the last two months. Even so, Representative Tom Lantos of California, the ranking Democrat on the House International Relations Committee, called it "misleading, fundamentally inaccurate and, to be generous, incredibly sloppy." 
"The events during the period, and since the reporting period, totally undermine the credibility of this report," Mr. Lantos added in an interview. He said he intended to ask Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to issue a supplemental report before the next regular report this fall, "just to highlight the obvious facts that are a matter of common knowledge and not in dispute." In recent weeks, Congress has been nearly monolithic in its support of Israel and condemnation of the Palestinians. 
In the last six months of last year, there were several suicide bombings by Palestinians, including an attack on a pizzeria in Jerusalem that killed 15 Israelis, and the report acknowledged that the Palestinian Authority "has in some important respects at least tolerated an atmosphere that promoted or supported the use of violence," through inciting statements and broadcasts.
As part of a campaign to discredit Mr. Arafat and replace him in any future peace negotiations, the government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon of Israel has produced reams of documents, many seized in recent raids in Palestinian areas, which it says prove that Mr. Arafat himself was responsible for terrorist attacks and the attempted weapons smuggling.
The Bush administration has not gone that far, but a senior administration official insisted this evening that Israeli information "confirms the view we've taken in this report that there are definitely elements of the Palestinian Authority that are involved in and complicit in violence." The official repeated the Bush administration's longstanding insistence that it held Mr. Arafat "ultimately responsible for the deeds of his organization, but that's different than holding him personally responsible."
In fact, the administration has walked a delicate line, at once sharply criticizing Mr. Arafat and calling on him to rein in violence and restructure Palestinian institutions, while contending that he cannot be replaced as the chief Palestinian leader except by the Palestinians themselves.
To that end, officials repeated today that they expected George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, to go to the Middle East as soon as next week, as President Bush requested, to help begin the process of rebuilding a Palestinian security force, despite the objections of some senior Israeli officials who say that is impossible as long as Mr. Arafat remains the Palestinian leader.
Secretary Powell and Mr. Tenet spoke by telephone today, and the State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, said, "The secretary has talked to him about travel to the region next week or so."
A senior official said he expected that a senior State Department official would accompany Mr. Tenet as a signal "that security is an essential part of the bigger picture and that the guys who do the political and economic issues care just as much about security."
After Mr. Tenet returns from the region, the official said, he may also hold talks with Israeli and Palestinian security officials in Washington, as Israel has suggested. But the official said Secretary Powell and others believed it was first important for Mr. Tenet, who drafted a cease-fire and security plan last summer, to assess conditions on the ground.
"The fundamental problem is the same one," the official said. "You need a clean, transparent, not corrupt security service without ties to terrorism." But, he added, in the end, "without a Palestinian Authority security service that can take care of this violence, then the only alternative is that Israel becomes responsible for every street corner in the West Bank and Gaza.
"Otherwise there's lawlessness," he said. 
"Israeli leaders realize that the only way to do this is with a responsible Palestinian security force, and that's what Tenet's visit is all about."

HEADLINE: State Budget Passage Leaves Questions for City Finances 

BYLINE:  By SHAILA K. DEWAN 

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 16 

 BODY:
The approval of the state budget today left New York City with question marks on its balance sheet. A list of requests from the Bloomberg administration, including permission to raise the city's cigarette tax to $1.50 from 8 cents and refinance its pension plans, were left largely unaddressed, even as lawmakers promised that some of the measures would be granted in a separate bill early next week.
 The details of that bill are still being worked out. But the cigarette tax, the pension refinancing, debt restructuring, a parking violation fine increase and a 911 surcharge on noncellular telephones will be included, legislative and city officials said. 
 At a news conference with Gov. George E. Pataki today, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg thanked leaders in Albany for "every bit of aid that you have been able to scrape together in what I know are tough economic times for the state."
He said the state had given the city what it had asked for "and then some." The education aid provided, the mayor said, is "such that there will be very minimal cuts if at all in education. I would like to get as much help as I can so that we don't have to cut any part of all the services the city provides."
But as revenue projections for the city continue to drop, the mayor will still need help from the federal government and city unions to close a projected budget gap of more than $5 billion, an aide said.
Some of the budget requests granted by the state are not quite what the city had hoped for. An early retirement plan passed today would give the city an estimated $20 million in savings, instead of $100 million, because fewer people would be eligible than the city had requested.
And while the state is apparently prepared to grant the cigarette tax increase, the city is expected to have to give almost half of the new revenues to the state, cutting the city's hoped-for $249 million to $125 million. The payments would replace losses to the state because the city tax is expected to drive down sales of cigarettes, reducing state cigarette tax revenues. 
And the city received a $163 million increase in school aid, instead of the $200 million it wanted. Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver and the Assembly's Democratic majority "have advanced a range of options to bring an additional $37 million in support for city schools," according to an Assembly news release. The money will probably come out of the Assembly's discretionary funds or the state capital budget, Mr. Silver said.
Other aid measures are expected to help downtown. In Lower Manhattan, the state will suspend the sales tax for shoppers for three three-day periods this summer, at a cost of a whopping $15 million.
But with the pending tax package, the city's savings could add up to what it had asked for. Although lawmakers expressed hope that the tax package for the city will be passed on Monday, the bill will require a home-rule message from the City Council, which does not have a scheduled meeting until Tuesday.
The council can call a special session Friday or Monday, but officials stressed today that they would first have to receive the legislation from Albany.
Another issue the bill writers are struggling with is a federal tax relief package for city businesses that would cost the city $128 million, because city taxes are tied to federal taxes, a city official said. The city wants to unlink the two so that businesses, except those in Lower Manhattan, would pay their full city tax but reduced state and federal taxes.
During floor debates today, some city lawmakers said the city was being shortchanged. Senator Liz Krueger, a Democrat who represents the Upper East Side, said the city was receiving 36 percent of the state's total aid to local governments. Others complained that the city was not receiving its fair share of environmental and transportation funds.
But Assemblywoman Deborah J. Glick, a Democrat who represents part of downtown Manhattan, said the Assembly had succeeded at restoring cuts to social services that benefit the city, like summer youth programs and child care.
"I think it has done as much as we could reasonably expect to do and maybe a little bit more," she said. "Like in the area of education, I think we've done a very good job."

HEADLINE: Schools for Sale 

 BODY:
It is no secret the public schools are strapped for cash, but they would be making a Faustian bargain if, as Schools Chancellor Harold Levy is urging, they allow advertising on school grounds. Even in difficult economic times, children should not have to be bombarded with pitches from Nike and Coca-Cola in order to get a decent education.
 Mr. Levy has proposed that New York City's school system solicit corporate sponsorships with the help of a private marketing company, which would keep 25 percent or more of the revenue. It is not entirely clear what kind of ads Mr. Levy proposes to bring into the schools. The chancellor's office has spoken of agreements with bottled water companies or computer suppliers. Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who supports the proposal, has suggested corporate logos on scoreboards. The chancellor insists that the schools will not accept ads for products, like tobacco, that are harmful to students. 
 But in-school marketing itself is harmful to students. School is one of the few places in young people's lives where commercial products are not constantly shoved down their throats. It diminishes schools to turn them into just one more place in which companies can troll for customers.
Naturally, proponents of in-school advertising insist it would be low-key and unobtrusive. But just as public television sponsorship announcements have increasingly come to resemble full-blown commercials, if advertising is allowed in schools it too will become more garish and intrusive over time.
Nor is it likely that ads would in fact be limited to products that are not harmful. In an age when young people beat each other up for their $150 sneakers, ads that put a school's imprimatur on athletic footwear can send precisely the wrong message. Given the evidence linking soda to obesity and tooth decay, soda ads may be no less pernicious.
After introducing his proposal to the Board of Education this week, where it was met with some skepticism, Mr. Levy withdrew it, at least temporarily. We hope he will abandon it entirely. The scheme is probably also a violation of the State Constitution, which has been interpreted in the past as forbidding schools to allow public property to be used for private advertising. 
Students are the ultimate in captive audiences, and Mr. Levy and Mr. Bloomberg should not hand them over to corporate marketers, even if it makes balancing the budget easier.

HEADLINE: House Passes a Welfare Bill With Stricter Rules on Work 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 16 

 BODY:
The House voted today to impose stricter work requirements on welfare recipients as part of a Republican plan to extend the change in social policy brought about by the 1996 welfare law.
 The measure, which closely follows recommendations from President Bush, now goes to the Senate, where some of its more restrictive provisions are likely to be modified. Senators are working on a bipartisan centrist bill. 
 The House vote, 229 to 197, was largely along party lines. Only 14 Democrats voted for it, and only 4 Republicans voted against it. 
The vote followed two days of debate that was full of political passion, but less raucous and less ideological than fights over the original measure in 1995 and 1996.
Just before passing the Republican bill today, the House voted 222 to 198 against a Democratic alternative that would have provided more money for child care and would have restored welfare benefits to legal immigrants who have not become citizens. 
Representative Heather A. Wilson, Republican of New Mexico, spoke for her party when she declared, "This is a great day for America, a great celebration of all we've achieved for America's children."
Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, said, "The House should be commended for its bold and courageous vote to take the next step of welfare reform." Mr. Bush said the House bill took a "compassionate approach" that would provide hope, dignity and independence for millions of Americans.
Democrats denounced the Republican bill as harsh and mean-spirited. They said its work requirements were unrealistic. They said it tied the hands of state officials and curtailed access to education and training for welfare recipients.
But Republicans had a potent political comeback.
"The Democrats were wrong in 1996, and we were right," said Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California, who repeatedly recalled the dire predictions Democrats made six years ago. 
A snag that delayed passage of the bill on Wednesday was resolved today with a compromise allowing states to seek exemptions from certain laws and rules that govern welfare, food stamps, public housing, job training, child care and other programs for low-income people. Under such waivers, states could, with federal permission, establish common rules for the different programs, but could not shift money from one federal program to another.
Since 1996, the number of people on welfare has dropped by more than half, to 5.3 million, and the proportion of children in poverty has declined to the lowest level in more than two decades.
Republicans discounted the Democratic criticism today, noting that much of it came from people who voted against the 1996 law.
In drafting their bill, House Republicans did not consult Democrats. White House officials said they knew they would eventually have to negotiate compromises with Democrats who control the Senate.
As the House finished debate today, Representative Sander M. Levin, Democratic of Michigan, said, "Fortunately there is a Senate to correct the hopelessly partisan efforts" of the Republican majority in the House.
Under the House Republican bill, states would get $16.5 billion a year, the same as under current law, for the main federal welfare program, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. The Democratic proposal would have allowed increases for inflation, providing $6 billion extra in the next five years. 
President Bush wanted to continue child care spending at the current level, $4.8 billion a year, for a total of $24 billion over five years. House Republicans added $2 billion to the total. Democrats wanted to add $11 billion.
The bill passed today would increase work requirements in two ways. By 2007, at least 70 percent of a state's adult welfare recipients would have to be engaged in work or job preparation activities, up from 50 percent required under current law. In addition, welfare recipients would have to participate in supervised activities for 40 hours a week, including at least 24 hours of actual work. The comparable figures under current law are 30 hours and 20 hours.
In practice, welfare recipients would have to work three days a week in regular jobs or government-created workfare positions. The other two days could be spent in education, training, drug treatment or other activities approved by the state.
Democrats said the Republican bill did not give states enough money to provide day care to people who would be required to work. But a parade of Republican women vouched for the merits of the bill, deflecting the Democratic criticism.
Kay Granger, Republican of Texas, said, "Talking as a single parent myself, I know that quality child care is absolutely necessary."
Mrs. Wilson of New Mexico said: "There are 2.3 million fewer children in poverty today because their moms have gotten good jobs. Federal funding for child care has tripled over the last five years, and that's at the same time that welfare caseloads have been cut in half. So there's more money per child."
The 1996 law eliminated a 60-year-old federal guarantee of cash assistance for the nation's poorest children and gave each state a lump sum of federal money, with vast discretion to run its own welfare program.
Under the House Republican bill -- in addition to the money specifically earmarked for child care -- a state could use as much as 50 percent of its welfare block grant for child care, up from the 30 percent allowed under current law.
But that was not enough for Democrats.
Representative Nydia M. Velazquez, Democrat of New York, asked: "How can a Congress that speaks so eloquently of family values pass legislation that clearly threatens our neediest families? By increasing work requirements, this bill forces parents to be away from their children for longer hours without providing adequate money for day care."
Moreover, Democrats said the Republican bill would encourage states to create "make work" jobs that would leave welfare recipients below the poverty level.
Representative Lynn Woolsey, a California Democrat who was on public assistance herself 35 years ago, said, "The worst thing about taking women and their families from welfare to work is that they have gone from welfare to poverty, and we are keeping those families in poverty" under the Republican bill.
Under the measure, the government would provide up to $300 million a year to promote "healthy marriage" through advertising campaigns, high school courses and premarital counseling. The bill also provides millions of dollars to promote sexual abstinence and "responsible fatherhood."
Representative John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, defended the increase in work requirements.
While welfare caseloads have declined substantially since 1996, there is room for improvement, Mr. Boehner said. "Fifty-eight percent of welfare recipients still are not engaged in any work-related activity," he said.
Moderate Republicans like Michael N. Castle of Delaware joined conservatives in backing the party's bill today. "I totally support this legislation," said Mr. Castle, a former governor. "I believe it will work. Perhaps some things need to be addressed, and I think they will be in the Senate."
Mr. Boehner rejected criticism from Democrats who said the bill would reduce access to education and training for welfare recipients.
"Under our bill," Mr. Boehner said, "welfare recipients can attend school full time for four months in any two-year period. They can spend up to 16 hours each week getting education and training to help further their ability to obtain gainful employment."
But Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, an architect of the bipartisan Senate bill, said the House measure would force poor women to seek jobs with no assurance of child care. The Senate bill would increase work requirements, but would give states more freedom to decide what counts as work.
Representative Ron Kind, Democrat of Wisconsin, said, "The Republican bill is very long on conservatism and very short on compassion."
The House Democratic substitute would have increased the work requirements in current law, but would have given states more latitude to count vocational education as work.
The Republicans who voted against the bill were John Hostettler and Brian Kerns of Indiana, Constance A. Morella of Maryland, and Ron Paul of Texas.
The Democrats voting for it were Robert E. Cramer of Alaska, Allen Boyd of Florida, David Phelps of Illinois, Ken Lucas of Kentucky, James A. Barcia of Michigan, Bill Luther and Collin C. Peterson of Minnesota, Ronnie Shows and Gene Taylor of Mississippi, Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota, David Wu of Oregon, Tim Holden of Pennsylvania, and Chet Edwards and Ralph M. Hall of Texas.

HEADLINE: At AOL, Parting Without the Sweet Sorrow 

BYLINE:  By GERALDINE FABRIKANT with SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
After AOL Time Warner's annual meeting yesterday, Richard D. Parsons told reporters that the shareholders who gathered at the Apollo Theater in Harlem had been "more gracious and respectful than I had anticipated."
 Mr. Parsons must have expected torches and pitchforks. While his coronation as AOL Time Warner's chief executive went off as planned yesterday, it was clear that the shareholders were irate. They, after all, have suffered the collapse of the stock price, which has lost about 64 percent of its value in the last year. 
 "These are our hard-earned dollars that we trusted to you, and you have decimated us," said one of many angry shareholders who strode to a microphone during the question-and-answer period. Another referred unhappily to the huge headquarters tower that the company is building on the West Side of Manhattan, saying the company was "replicating the Taj Mahal on Columbus Circle" while shareholders nurse their losses. 
Mr. Parsons and Stephen M. Case, the company's chairman, stoically braved the barrage. But the executive who did not take questions was the man whom Mr. Parsons is replacing: Gerald M. Levin, who retired yesterday after 30 years at the company and its predecessors, the last decade as chief executive. 
Mr. Levin gave a brief farewell address in which he thanked shareholders for "faith, hope and, above all, patience." Most of the audience of perhaps 1,400 replied with a polite standing ovation. But others sat in stony silence. For while it is Mr. Parsons who must now try to fix AOL Time Warner, it is Mr. Levin whom some shareholders, analysts and industry executives blame for the current state of the company.
During his career, first at Time Inc., then Time Warner and finally AOL Time Warner, Mr. Levin knew his share of successes -- primarily as a deal maker. But he leaves under a cloud of perceptions that the 2000 merger that created AOL Time Warner may have been one deal too many.
"You just lost $54 billion," an angry shareholder told the executives yesterday, referring to the noncash charge that AOL Time Warner took in the first quarter to account for the company's plunge in value since the merger. "Where'd that come from?" the accuser continued. "Our pockets -- the shareholders -- not the options you got."
Because Mr. Levin is expected to continue as an adviser to the company, analysts and company executives are wary of discussing his legacy on the record. But a recurrent criticism is that Mr. Levin gave away too much of the company when he agreed to merger terms in January 2000 that granted America Online 55 percent of Time Warner for AOL stock -- just months before the bursting of the Internet bubble. 
No one can predict the future of the stock market, of course. But industry executives also fault Mr. Levin for having overestimated the opportunities for complements between Time Warner's conventional media holdings and AOL's Internet business. 
"When he sold to AOL, he sold for nothing," one industry executive said. "It was pretty clear that the great synergies Jerry talked about were unrealistic." 
Mr. Levin's earlier deal-making record was also mixed. In 1989, when he was vice chairman at Time Inc., he was a lead negotiator of the merger between Time and Warner Communications. Because Paramount Communications opened a bidding war by trying to acquire Time, the Time Warner merger ended up being completed at a price that left the new company $18 billion in debt. 
The terms of that deal also allowed the Warner executives' stock options to vest upon the merger's completion and they were immediately granted new options. The Time executives did not have comparable option packages, producing enormous resentment in some quarters, which made the corporate cultures harder to meld than they might otherwise have been. 
To his benefit, Mr. Levin is generally credited with having been prescient in building the company's stake in cable television. In 1995 he supplemented that effort through two major acquisitions: the $2.2 billion purchase of Cablevision Industries' 1.3 million subscribers, and the $2.3 billion acquisition of Houston Industries and its 700,000 subscribers. "He was right on cable values when everyone said that he was making a mistake and that the technology would become obsolete," said one media executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 
Mr. Levin's move to acquire the Turner Broadcasting System in 1995 is also considered a shrewd one. Even though the $7.5 billion purchase diluted Time Warner's stock at the time, the underlying businesses were solid ones that included CNN, the TBS cable network and the Cartoon Network. Those businesses gave Time Warner even greater influence in the fast-growing cable programming sector.
And yet, the Turner merger, which made Ted Turner a Time Warner vice chairman and the company's biggest shareholder, also illustrated one of Mr. Levin's liabilities: managing relationships. Initially, Mr. Turner described himself as a fan of Mr. Levin. But people close to Mr. Turner say he came to feel excluded and powerless after the merger of AOL and Time Warner. Increasingly, Mr. Turner became known as a Levin adversary who criticized him to other board members and to other media executives. 
The rift with Mr. Turner was not the only indication that Mr. Levin was more attuned to making deals than dealing with people. 
There was well-publicized turmoil, for example, at the Warner Music division in the mid-1990's. After a series of managers left Warner Music, Mr. Levin handed it in 1995 to an executive with scant music experience, Michael Fuchs, the longtime head of the company's Home Box Office cable network. Within six months, he was forced out of the company, reportedly because the powerful executives then running the film division -- Robert A. Daly and Terry Semel -- wanted to add it to their portfolio. 
Only after Mr. Daly and Mr. Semel themselves resigned in 1999, did Mr. Levin finally appoint a recording industry executive to run Warner Music: Roger Ames, the former president of Polygram Music. Under Mr. Ames, Warner Music has regained market share, but still lags well behind the industry leader, Universal. 
Other parts of the business fared better in the 1990's. In 1998 Time Warner's stock rose 60 percent, reaching $63.125, largely on the strength of its cable business. And Mr. Levin was gradually paring the company's staggering debt. 
But by late 1999, during the bull market, the company's growth was slowing and the stock was up only about 15 percent for the year -- in unflattering contrast to the large run-ups by various Internet companies, including America Online, whose shares rose 96 percent that same year. Mr. Levin became hungry for the next big deal. 
And yet, his keep-your-own-counsel management approach led him to conduct the AOL merger negotiations in the fall of 1999 without the guidance of many of his own top executives. 
"The deal with AOL was announced on Monday morning, and we found out about it Sunday night," a top Time Warner executive recalled, remembering the merger announcement on Jan. 10, 2000. "How could you argue for a deal where you give up 55 percent of the company without consulting your other top managers? There was no give and take. There was no internal discussion." 
It was little wonder that as chief executive of the combined AOL Time Warner, Mr. Levin had scant success making the two companies' disparate cultures work together. But that task now becomes the job of Mr. Parsons, an executive not known as a deal maker -- but one with a reputation, at least, of knowing how to deal with people.
One person Mr. Parsons has tried to cultivate is the vice chairman, Mr. Turner. 
Asked about Mr. Levin's legacy yesterday, Mr. Turner lunged for the last laugh. "I have no comment," he said, as he left the Apollo Theater. Then he paused and reconsidered. "No," Mr. Turner said. "We're going to miss him. Ha, ha, ha."

HEADLINE: On Crossing the Strait to Cuba 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 According to "Bush Plans to Tighten Sanctions on Cuba, Not Ease Them" (news article, May 15), a Bush adviser on Latin America, Otto J. Reich, recently said, "We will not throw a lifeline to save a regime that is sinking under the weight of its own historic failures." If President Bush's goal is to deprive Fidel Castro of economic lifelines, he should point out that the Cuban-American community, not a small number of legal and illegal American travelers, provides the most substantial lifeline by sending millions in cash and goods to relatives on the island. 
 Mr. Bush should prohibit further payments. The high level of payments is a result of Clinton administration policies. So a ban now -- when former President Jimmy Carter has turned a spotlight on Cuba -- would not only eliminate a major source of dollars for Mr. Castro, but also constitute a rebuff to another former Democratic president who was "soft on Cuba."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
A 5thConsecutive Gain Puts Nasdaq Up 8.8% for Week

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Wall Street ended a big week on a quiet but encouraging note yesterday, as modest gains lifted the Nasdaq composite index to its first five-session winning streak in seven months.
 The Dow Jones industrial average also returned to levels not seen in more than five weeks, despite trading that caused the major indexes to fluctuate for much of the day. Analysts said the market's ability to hold steady, rather than fall sharply on profit taking or fears that the week's big advance would fizzle, suggested that investor confidence was slowly recovering. 
 "We've hung on to most of the gains and the market's overall tone is better and the news appears to be improving," said Rafael Tamargo, director of equity research at Wilmington Trust. "I do think there is a base here for us to build on."
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 63.87 points, or 0.6 percent, at 10,353.08. The gauge, which enjoyed two triple-digit advances earlier this week, had its highest finish since April 10, when it stood at 10,381.73. 
Broader stock indicators also moved higher. The technology-focused Nasdaq gained 10.95 points, or 0.6 percent, to 1,741.39. Its last five-session gain was in early October. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 8.36 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,106.59.
For the week, the Dow gained 4.1 percent, the Nasdaq rose 8.8 percent and the S.& P. climbed 4.9 percent.
Yesterday's trading was mostly lackluster. Although the market got an upbeat outlook from Dell Computer and encouraging consumer sentiment numbers, investors appeared to be taking a break, which was not surprising after four days of mostly higher results, analysts said.
Dell rose 10 cents, to $27.95, on earnings that beat expectations despite a slight drop in first-quarter profits. The company also raised its forecast for second-quarter profits. Microsoft rose 29 cents, to $56.03, while Intel rose 43 cents, to $31.20.
Wall Street was pleased with, but not inspired by, a University of Michigan report on consumer sentiment. The school's index rose to 96.0 in mid-May from 93.0 in mid-April. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of the economy, so any improvement in consumer sentiment is considered good for business.
Among blue-chip stocks, Schering-Plough rose $1.37, to $26.12, after announcing it would pay the federal government $500 million to settle quality control issues at two plants. The stock had fallen earlier in the week on reports of criminal investigation by the government, which has yet to be resolved. Schering-Plough also reduced its 2002 forecast.
But the clothing retailer Gap dropped 59 cents, to $16.30, on first-quarter earnings that beat expectations but still showed weak sales.
Despite the strength of the market this week, analysts are cautious.
"The tone of the market in the last week or so has changed," said Mike Kayes, chief investment officer at Eastover Capital. "We're getting better earning reports from important companies. There is the potential to move higher, but it's going to happen slowly."
Treasury prices fell for the first day in three on reports that consumer confidence was up. By late in the day, the 10-year note fell 20/32, to a price of 97 4/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.26 percent from 5.17 percent.
The 30-year bond fell 28/32, to 94 22/32. Its yield increased to 5.76 percent from 5.68 percent.

Tokyo SeesEnd of Recession, But Others Are Not So Sure

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON 

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 17 

 BODY:
Japan's government signaled today that it believed that the country's third recession in the last decade had ended, joining a growing band of optimistic forecasters in the private sector. But many experts suspect that the government's outlook is born more of political pragmatism than economic analysis.
 In its monthly report for May, published today, the government said that conditions remained "difficult" but that the economy had "bottomed," magic words for investors hunting for the right moment to jump in while stock prices are cheap. 
 The comments in the report are not an official declaration of an end to the downturn, which began in late 2000; most private economists and the Bank of Japan have also stopped short of saying definitively that the tide has turned. But the government's view echoes their guardedly positive forecasts.
Exhibit A is the recent growth in Japanese exports to the United States and Asia, which the government says is pushing up output and driving down inventories. But many analysts are skeptical that the upturn in exports will spread to other parts of the economy. 
Capital spending is still weakening, they say, and consumer spending remains pinned down by falling wages and employment. Many economists expect more contraction later this year after a bit of growth in the first-quarter gross domestic product report, due June 6.
Because of the country's huge debt, Japanese lawmakers are being pressed not to stimulate the economy with more government spending, as they have done repeatedly since 1992.
Moody's Investors Service has said it is considering another downgrade of the country's credit rating this month, potentially ranking it on a par with Botswana. 
Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi has staked his job on reining in the country's runaway debt, which now exceeds gross domestic product by 40 percent. Unusually in Japan, he promised a specific ceiling of 30 trillion yen ($234 billion) a year on new bond issues.
Now, with his popularity waning, Mr. Koizumi must defend that cap or risk the fate of Ryutaro Hashimoto, a predecessor whose government fell apart in 1998 when the ruling Liberal Democratic Party forced him to break a belt-tightening pledge and spend more to fend off recession.
"Calling an end to the recession gives Koizumi and the Finance Ministry some leverage over the pork barrel politicians in the L.D.P.," said Ryo Hino, an economist at J. P. Morgan Securities in Tokyo.
In Japan, when there are deep differences over fundamental policy questions, the result is often a set of watered-down goals with vague deadlines or promises to study the issue further, allowing all sides to claim victory without accomplishing anything.
"Policy inertia is deeply rooted in Japan, and signs of life in the economy are an excuse to do nothing for another six months," said Andrew Shipley, chief economist at West LB Securities in Tokyo. "But the fact remains, the economy is not out of the woods yet, as much as the government would like to trumpet it."

HEADLINE: Fed Wants to Raise Interest Rate on Its Direct Loans to Banks 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve proposed a substantial change today in its system of lending directly to banks, saying it wants to increase the interest rate it charges on emergency overnight loans.
 Under the proposal, the central bank's discount rate on overnight loans to banks would be set at a level above its federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks. The Fed has typically kept the discount rate -- the instrument through which it fulfills its role as lender of last resort to financial institutions -- well below the federal funds rate. 
 The move appeared directed largely at limiting daily gyrations in the federal funds rate in the money markets, giving the Fed more control over its efforts to stimulate or rein in the economy. It would also reduce the possibility that banks could borrow cheaply from the Fed through the discount window and then lend the money back out at higher rates. 
But some analysts and bankers said it also reflected a philosophy long espoused by Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, that favors trying to reduce what amounts to market-distorting government subsidies throughout the financial system. Under the new proposal, banks that get into financial difficulty would have to pay more, not less, than healthy banks do to borrow from the Fed.
Banks typically borrow directly from the Fed at the discount rate only when they are in financial trouble or during a crisis within the financial system, as in the days after last Sept. 11. They usually meet their need for short-term financing in the federal funds market, where banks and brokers trade tens of billions of dollars a day and rates are effectively set by the Fed through its buying and selling of government securities.
Fed officials said that if the proposal was adopted, they would initially set the discount rate a full percentage point above the federal funds target rate. The discount rate is currently 1.25 percent, half a percentage point below the federal funds target rate of 1.75 percent.
The officials said they expected the difference between the rates to vary depending on economic and financial conditions.
"This does not involve a change in the stance of monetary policy," said Edward M. Gramlich, a Fed governor. "It's a technical change."
Fed officials said they hoped the change would reduce volatility in the federal funds market, which is the primary means for the Fed to influence the economy. By setting the discount rate above the federal funds target rate, the Fed would create a new channel of financing. In effect, the funds rate would be capped at the level of the discount rate, since banks would borrow from the Fed's discount window any time the funds rate threatened to surpass the discount rate.
Banks have often shied away from using the discount window because doing so can be taken as a sign of financial difficulties. Under the new system, Fed officials said, banks could avoid the stigma of having to submit to an intrusive examination of their financial need.
The Fed said it would maintain a special category of lending through the discount window for banks that are in financial trouble, but the rate offered them would also be above the federal funds target rate.
Banking groups said they viewed the proposal primarily as an increase in their financing costs. But they suggested that they were unlikely to fight hard against it.
"It's hard to argue with the theory of decreasing volatility and making the discount window more efficient," said James Chessen, chief economist at the American Bankers Association. "But basic economics tells you that if you raise the price you'll get fewer people interested in the product. So banks will do less borrowing at the Fed and seek other funds."
Mr. Chessen said the Fed would have to find some way to ensure that the discount rate could be dropped quickly in a financial crisis. Fed officials said they were working on that, but had not yet come up with a plan.

HEADLINE: Survey Says Consumers Are More Confident 

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Consumer sentiment rose in early May to its highest level in 18 months as improvement in the stock market, better economic reports and relative calm in the Mideast lifted consumers' spirits. 
 The preliminary reading in the University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment for May rose to 96.0, a level not seen since December 2000. 
The index had fallen to 93.0 in April, and May forecasts were for another small drop to 92.7. 
 "The report is encouraging in terms of reflecting a steady improvement in consumer attitudes, which should bode well for spending in the second quarter," said Anthony Karydakis, an economist at Banc One Capital Markets in Chicago. 
A rise in the index could support the view that consumer spending, which underpins two-thirds of the economy, will not let up. Retail sales data, which showed a 1.2 percent growth rate in April, were double forecasts and ensured a strong start to second-quarter growth. 
The sentiment index has recovered substantially from a low of 81.8 after Sept. 11, but it is still sharply off its high of 111.3 in early 2000. 
In addition, Michigan's preliminary current conditions index, which tracks consumers' views about their financial situation, surged to 103.2 in May from 99.2, and the expectations index, which measures attitudes about the 12 months ahead, rose to 91.3 in May from 89.1 in April. 
The sentiment survey is based on telephone interviews with roughly 250 Americans across the country.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Fights Proposed Rules on Auditors 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17 

 BODY:
Republicans led by Senator Phil Gramm of Texas and the accounting industry's trade group are working to kill a Democratic measure that would impose new rules on auditors, companies and investment banks in the wake of Enron's collapse.
 The bill was drafted by Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland and the chairman of the Senate Banking Committee, and is scheduled to be considered on Tuesday by Mr. Sarbanes's panel. It was endorsed today by a group that included Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve. 
 But Congressional officials said today that Republicans, led by Mr. Gramm, were preparing to use parliamentary maneuvers to delay the measure and either water it down or have it killed. 
Mr. Gramm, who is working closely with the Bush administration, met this week with representatives from influential financial trade groups and urged them to write to Mr. Sarbanes to "let them know of their problems with the legislation," a participant at the meeting said. The trade groups included the Securities Industry Association, the Investment Company Institute, the Business Roundtable and the Financial Services Roundtable.
Mr. Gramm has also asked Mr. Sarbanes to postpone the session on Tuesday, a move that Mr. Sarbanes has rebuffed. On Thursday, Mr. Gramm sent Mr. Sarbanes a list of more than 140 questions about the legislation that he said had "been raised by a variety of parties."
Although his wife, Wendy Lee Gramm, served on the board of Enron, he has shown no indication of being deterred from playing a vigorous role during the debate over the measure. Angela De Rocha, a spokeswoman for Mr. Gramm, said the legislation had no relationship to Enron and therefore did not pose any conflicts of interest. Mr. Gramm has announced that he will step down from the Senate when his term expires early next year.
The Sarbanes bill would create an organization under the guidance of the Securities and Exchange Commission to set professional standards and oversee and discipline auditors. The measure would impose some restrictions on the ability of accounting firms to perform both auditing and certain consulting services for the same client. And it would require firms to rotate auditors so that an accountant could not work for more than five consecutive years for the same client.
The bill would also add new obligations to corporate audit committees. And it would impose new conflict-of-interest rules for analysts at investment banks, rules that go beyond those recently approved by the S.E.C.
Senator Gramm, the ranking Republican on the banking committee, has collaborated with a fellow Republican, Senator Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming, on a bill that is like a measure passed by the House. That legislation gives the industry more of a role in the oversight board and contains fewer restrictions on consulting services and no new conflict-of-interest rules for stock analysts. It also imposes no requirements on rotating auditors.
Supporters of the House bill say it is less intrusive than the Sarbanes measure, while critics like institutional investors and consumer groups say the House legislation is a weak and ineffective sop to the accounting industry. The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants has applauded the House legislation as "unprecedented and rigorous."
In recent days the institute, which is dominated by the nation's largest accounting firms, has waged a broad lobbying effort that has included the use of Maryland accountants to try to dissuade Mr. Sarbanes from moving ahead.
In a message sent to members of the institute on Wednesday, J. Thomas Higginbotham, a senior lobbyist for the group, urged the accountants to contact lawmakers to oppose the bill because "it would result in a de facto government takeover of the accounting profession and it would micromanage public companies' relationship with their auditors."
"The Sarbanes proposal does not help auditors do a better job for investors; rather it punishes companies and auditors alike while making it more difficult to serve investors," the institute said in its message. "In adding onerous burdens of cost and inefficiency, the proposal would make it more difficult for companies to prosper and grow. Congress should consider proposals that will promote economic recovery, not enact legislation that inhibits it."
The Sarbanes bill was endorsed today by a group including Mr. Volcker; Charles A. Bowsher, the former comptroller general of the United States and head of the Public Oversight Board, which is now disbanded; John C. Bogle, the founder and retired chairman of the Vanguard Group; and C. Michael Cook, former chairman and chief executive of Deloitte & Touche.
In a letter to Mr. Sarbanes, Mr. Volcker, speaking on behalf of the group, warned that the four largest accounting firms aside from Arthur Andersen "have reverted to past instinct, joining hands to resist meaningful reform efforts."
"The sheer number and magnitude of breakdowns that have increasingly become the daily fare of the business press pose a clear and present danger to the effectiveness and efficiency of capital markets in which the United States has taken so much pride," Mr. Volcker said. "The fact is the integrity of those markets is of critical importance to investors and those in need of financing alike. At the same time, the attendant publicity and concern afford a rare opportunity for meaningful and lasting reform -- reform that has been resisted for far too long. The opportunity must not be missed."
The legislation faces formidable odds of becoming law. Its most difficult challenge may be making it through the Senate in the face of the opposition from Mr. Gramm. Despite his announced intention to retire soon, he maintains considerable political influence and has been a master throughout his career of using parliamentary rules to kill legislation he dislikes. 
If the Sarbanes bill successfully runs the Republican gantlet and is approved by the Senate, it would still have to be reconciled with the House bill before it could reach the president's desk.

Patting a Back Can Be Painful If It's Yours

BYLINE:  By CLYDE HABERMAN 

 BODY:
ORTHOPEDISTS in Albany must have worked overtime yesterday. There had to have been a lot of sprained arms, considering how hard politicians in the state capital patted themselves on the back for approving a budget.
 The Senate Republican leader, Joseph L. Bruno, practically put this mundane chore on a par with parting the Red Sea. Lawmakers, he said, had "truly worked a miracle." As some fiscal monitors saw it, the real miracle may be keeping the $89.6 billion budget from collapsing under its own weight. 
 The budget does have certain charms, though, one being that it has drawn raspberries from both the left and the right.
Conservatives blinked hard at a spending increase of 6 percent, well above the inflation rate. Aren't these supposed to be hard times, some on the right asked, and not the moment for a more or less standard election-year budget?
Liberals saw the gnarled hand of fiscal gimmickry, including a heavy dependence on one-time-only revenues, the kind of stuff that jolts budget watchdogs awake in a cold sweat at 3 a.m. Wouldn't it have been wiser, not to mention rather courageous, some on the left asked, to raise income and business taxes ever so judiciously?
"This is definitely not a budget for high-fives," said Jonathan Bowles, research director at the Center for an Urban Future, a liberal public policy group in Manhattan.
What sticks in Mr. Bowles's craw is that Albany didn't come close to undoing the harm it did to New York City in the palmier days of the late 1990's.
True, it came up with some more money, including a possible $200 million that may keep Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg from putting the schools budget through a Vegematic. But by Mr. Bowles's calculations -- and he keeps close tabs on these matters -- decisions by the Legislature and Gov. George E. Pataki are costing the city something in the neighborhood of $2 billion a year. To filch a famous line from the late Senator Everett M. Dirksen, if you take a billion here and a billion there, pretty soon you're talking about real money.
None of those dollar-siphoning moves are being re-examined now that New York City is no longer flush and, on the contrary, is hurting badly. "They didn't do nearly enough," Mr. Bowles said of the lawmakers and the governor. "There's no accounting for Sept. 11 and the city's unprecedented budget gap. It was like this was any other budget year."
Some of Albany's actions have been highlighted by the mayor and by the city's Independent Budget Office.
Heading the list is the infamous repeal of the commuter tax in 1999, a maneuver rooted in narrow party politics, not grand fiscal strategy. It has needlessly deprived the city of more than $400 million a year, a figure expected to exceed $500 million by 2005.
THREE years ago, Albany's elders justified their action on the grounds that the economy was booming and New York City did not need the money. Somehow the idea that a pendulum can swing eluded them, and apparently still does. And while Mr. Bloomberg has suggested that a commuter tax is reasonable, he was unwilling to press the Legislature to act boldly -- dare one say valorously -- in his troubled city's behalf, even if this is an election year, when politicians play it safe.
There have been other blows to the city treasury, including at least one that was inflicted, amazingly enough, after the terrorist attack of Sept. 11. It eliminated $114 million a year that the state had long paid the city to make up for revenue lost when a tax on stock transfers was scrapped in the 1970's.
The list of harmful actions goes on. Over City Hall's objections, Albany changed the arbitration procedures for city police officers in a way that costs the municipal treasury an estimated $200 million a year in extra benefits and salaries. Pension adjustments for retired city workers are costing the city $236 million a year; that may grow to $586 million in three years.
If you throw in a bunch of other items -- including formulas for revenue sharing, municipal aid and property-tax relief that arguably short-change New York City -- the total creeps toward that $2 billion.
Plain and simple, Mr. Bowles concluded, Albany did less than it could have to "heal some of the wounds for the city that is the economic engine of the state."
He was not completely on target about high-fives, though. There are plenty of high-fives in the city's budget. That's where the deficit is headed, according to some forecasts, to the high five billion.

HEADLINE: Vanishing Act: Whitman Stays Far From Home In New Jersey 

BYLINE:  By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: TRENTON, May 16 

 BODY:
Where's Christie?
 She conquered New Jersey's Republican establishment, dominated politics and public policy in the state for most of a decade and became a model of genteel suburban Republicanism for the governors of other states to imitate. But as her party struggles to find its footing after several debacles, Christie Whitman is hardly to be seen in her home state. 
 Although the White House has sent her on a round of campaigning for Republican Congressional candidates around the country, Mrs. Whitman, now the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has not been seen at a Republican Party event in New Jersey since last fall.
And none of the candidates in next month's Republican primary for the United States Senate has asked for her endorsement. 
Moreover, she has shown little interest in claiming the role of party elder that two other two-term former governors, Brendan T. Byrne and Thomas H. Kean, still play with such evident relish.
"You would expect an ex-two-term governor to be much more of a political presence in the state, but she's a phantom," said Professor Ross K. Baker, a political scientist at Rutgers University.
"And really, if her name has been before the public at all, it has been through Governor McGreevey making unkind comments about her economic policies and her Supreme Court nominations and so on."
Mrs. Whitman, 55, declined to be interviewed for this article, and her office referred questions to Pete McDonough, her former press secretary, who is now a public relations consultant for her. 
Mr. McDonough said Mrs. Whitman would get involved again in state politics after the June 4 Senate primary, and planned to campaign soon in two New Jersey Congressional races.
But for now, he said, Mrs. Whitman has given up most of her cherished weekends at home in Somerset County to campaign in 22 states, from Maine to Hawaii, for Republicans in tight Congressional races.
"I wouldn't read anything into the fact that she hasn't been involved in the Senate campaign here," he said. "She has been spending most of her political efforts around the country where the White House has targeted candidates."
Other New Jersey politicians and politician-watchers, including Republicans, offer other explanations for Mrs. Whitman's low profile here. Because she made an end run around the party leaders to the governor's office, they say, and because of her preference for dealing with other politicians through staff members rather than over a friendly drink after work, she never developed the kind of deep bonds with the party that might now be tugging her home. 
In addition, Mrs. Whitman's thin margins of victory in two gubernatorial races diminished the reputation she acquired as a giant-killer after she almost unseated a United States Senator, Bill Bradley.
Gov. James E. McGreevey, a Democrat, has harshly attacked Mrs. Whitman and her interim successor, Donald T. DiFrancesco, several times for everything from her State Supreme Court appointments to the deficit Mr. McGreevey said he inherited from the Republicans. 
Mrs. Whitman bore Mr. McGreevey's attacks in silence until he charged that her judicial appointments had lowered the quality of the Supreme Court.
In a letter to the governor released on April 29, she wrote, "Yours were the kind of unfounded comments that, on their face, diminish not only the person who makes them, but also the office in which he serves."
Mrs. Whitman, as an obscure county freeholder, stormed to prominence in 1992, nearly unseating Senator Bradley by tying him to a huge state tax increase pushed by his fellow Democrat, Gov. Jim Florio.
The next year she defeated Mr. Florio for the governorship and then won re-election against Mr. McGreevey four years later. Adopting her style, the Republican Party maintained control of both houses of the Legislature during her tenure, while two Republicans running for governor in New York and Connecticut, George E. Pataki and John G. Rowland, explicitly made her blend of fiscal tightfistedness and social liberalism the model for their own successful campaigns.
Today, Democrats control the New Jersey Assembly and the governorship, and are tied with the Republicans in the State Senate, and Mrs. Whitman has left little trace of herself in the state's political life. 
Stephen Salmore, a Republican consultant and a frequent critic of Mrs. Whitman, said that although she was a hard worker, she somehow never made enough friends in the party to have a following today.
"That's the interesting thing," Mr. Salmore said. "She was a very good soldier for raising money, even for people she disagreed with, yet no Republican is clamoring for her to appear with them."
Roger Bodman, who was a member of Mr. Kean's cabinet and later his campaign manager, said the two former Republican governors were too different in their careers to share a pedestal as party leaders today. 
"She was not a product of the Legislature, and therefore had an often caustic, or even nonexistent, relationship with the leadership," said Mr. Bodman, now a prominent lobbyist and occasional political commentator. "Kean was an assemblyman and minority leader and speaker for 10 years in the Legislature, so I'm not surprised at some of the carping you hear about Christie. But I think her legacy is yet to be defined."
It is traditional in New Jersey for acting and former party leaders to stay neutral in primaries, and that is the explanation for Mrs. Whitman's silence offered by the three candidates for the Republican Senate nomination -- State Senators Diane Allen and John J. Matheussen, and Douglas R. Forrester, the former mayor of West Windsor.
Yet both Mrs. Whitman and Mr. Kean chose sides in last year's Republican gubernatorial primary, when they endorsed Bob Franks over the eventual winner, Bret D. Schundler.
And Mr. McDonough, Mrs. Whitman's political spokesman, said she would attend a rally in New Brunswick on Monday for Buster Soaries, her former secretary of state, who is seeking the Republican nomination for the 12th Congressional District seat now held by Rush Holt, a Democrat. Mr. McDonough said she would also campaign for Michael Ferguson, a freshman Republican, in the Seventh Congressional District.
"You're in the doldrums after the legislative and the gubernatorial campaigns, and there hasn't been a lot to do politically," Mr. McDonough said. "But I would imagine that once the primary has settled out you'll see her campaigning aggressively."
By their own admission, state Republican leaders have much to do. Mrs. Whitman is the last Republican to have won a statewide race, in 1997, and since then, the Democrats have won both a United States Senate seat and the governorship. No well-known Republican from the state's broad political center came forward to challenge Robert G. Torricelli, the incumbent Senator up for re-election, leaving the field to relatively unknown candidates. 
With polls and election results showing New Jersey shifting toward the Democrats, Professor Baker said, there is an important job for former Republican heavyweights like Mrs. Whitman to play.
"Parties always like to hearken back to the golden age, and if you have someone who represents that age, who was a winner, that's what brings people to their feet, that's what opens their wallets," he said. "But Christie Whitman does not play that role."

CORRECTION-DATE: May 22, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on Saturday about former Gov. Christie Whitman's absence from New Jersey politics since her appointment to head the Environmental Protection Agency misstated the year she first came to prominence by nearly unseating Senator Bill Bradley. It was 1990, not 1992.

HEADLINE: Congress Is Urged to Block Use Of Offshore Income Tax Shelters 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 17 

 BODY:
The Treasury Department urged Congress tonight to stop companies from using offshore shelters to avoid United States income taxes but warned that the problem could not be solved by legislation that simply outlawed overseas tax havens.
 "These transactions can have significant adverse effects on the U.S. economy," the agency said in a report released after lawmakers had left for the weekend. The use of shelters also "erodes confidence in the fairness of the tax system," the report stated. 
 But it cautioned that "there is serious risk that measures targeted too narrowly would have the unintended effect of encouraging a shift to other forms of transactions to the detriment of the U.S. economy in the long run."
For years, American companies have reincorporated in countries like Bermuda that have no income taxes. But the Treasury said there had been a "marked increase recently in the frequency, size and profile of the transactions." 
Stanley Works, the Connecticut maker of hand tools, has been the latest to consider reincorporating offshore, in Bermuda. Shareholders voted for the move, but the company threw out the vote after Connecticut officials filed a lawsuit saying Stanley used deception to win the vote. 
Democrats have seized on the issue to try to force Republicans into an embarrassing vote that would require them either to vote against business interests, a main element of the Republican political base, or seem to be supporting an unpatriotic move of companies abroad.
Republicans in the House canceled a vote this week on a bill that would have lowered taxes for many married couples after Democrats threatened to use motions or amendments to the bill to get a vote on the issue of overseas tax havens.
On Thursday, Representative Nancy L. Johnson, a Connecticut Republican, introduced legislation to impose an immediate moratorium on companies that reincorporate abroad for tax reasons while more detailed legislation is developed.
If Mrs. Johnson's bill becomes law, it would delay discussions until after this year's Congressional elections.
Senior senators on the Finance Committee, including Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the top Republican, have promised to approve legislation this year that would ban the use of tax havens.
Until today, the Treasury has not seemed overly concerned about the issue, arguing that more fundamental questions were involved like the way multinational corporations are taxed. But the matter has gained political momentum, forcing the Treasury to address it.
In a statement with the report, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill promised to work with Congress to deal with companies that cut taxes by "nominally moving their headquarters offshore" and with matters that put American companies at a competitive disadvantage.

HEADLINE: Albany's 'Miracle' Budget 

 BODY:
After New York State's legislators adopted their $90 billion budget this week, one leader lovingly called it a "miracle." If a miracle is something that may be too good to be true, then he's right. This budget is designed to do one thing well -- re-elect incumbents this fall. It is full of apparent good news, especially for New York City, while under the press releases are signs of financial trouble. 
 To fill a big and growing revenue gap, the budget uses up most of the state's savings and reserves, $3.1 billion, and borrows an additional $900 million. Gov. George Pataki's earlier argument that New York's calamities justified exemptions from normal budget-making rules seemed to make sense. But now there is a growing concern that this final plan was entirely driven by the election calendar. 
 Over the short term, the news is upbeat. New York City's schools would gain about $400 million, enough for Mayor Michael Bloomberg to negotiate decent pay increases for teachers while retaining important school programs. Mr. Pataki refused to add sufficiently substantial taxes to fill the gap. And instead of delaying the next round of tax cuts, which were passed back when the economy was booming, Mr. Pataki insisted on sticking to the script, at a cost of $1 billion more over the next three years. Albany's legislators also held onto $170 million in "member items" -- political gold that allows legislative leaders to announce projects in their districts. 
There were other political giveaways. Perhaps the most egregious was a last-minute budget item on infertility, a pre-Election-Day reward primarily to powerful blocs of Orthodox Jewish voters in Brooklyn and Rockland County. For those who value large families, the deal requires certain insurance firms to pay for some infertility treatments, and puts up $10 million in state money to underwrite expensive in vitro fertilization procedures. Nobody wants to deprive people of having children, but the state would not have committed public money to pay for a costly elective procedure like this if legislators were setting priorities by anything except the fall elections. 
Many other important legislative issues have been left hanging while leaders negotiated this budget. Mr. Pataki needs to follow through on his fading promise for campaign finance reform and his plans to redo the unfair Rockefeller drug laws. Sheldon Silver and his Assembly Democrats are standing in the way of streamlining the management of New York City's education system by giving the mayor control over public schools. Women's health issues are in limbo. Even as the governor and Legislature are congratulating themselves and heading off to campaign for re-election, voters should ask what is behind these joyful budget numbers and what else the state's politicians have done to earn their jobs in Albany.

HEADLINE: Lower Manhattan Retailers Still Suffer Without Foot Traffic 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
Pasquale Di Tillio says his pizzeria on Cortlandt Street, half a block from the World Trade Center site, is doing about a third of the business it did before the terrorist attack eight months ago.
 Jim Boudouvas, a Fulton Street florist whose shop is little more than a block from the site, says his business is down about 40 percent from pre-Sept. 11 levels. 
 Minas Polychronakis lost the most profitable of his three shoe-repair shops -- it was in the trade center's mall. He said his two other operations, several blocks away, were both limping along, with business down 30 percent at each. 
An estimated 100,000 jobs were lost downtown as a result of the attack. And while many of those jobs have come back, with the reopening of the World Financial Center and other buildings, many will not return, at least not soon. And many of the small retail, food and service businesses in Lower Manhattan that rely on local walk-in trade or telephone orders are struggling.
While the talk downtown has turned to redevelopment of the devastated site and rejuvenation of the area, the owners of these businesses say they wonder if they will be around to benefit from any recovery. And though they frequently complain about what they term inadequate aid and the complicated applications for that aid, the biggest obstacle to the health of their businesses is a simple lack of customers.
"The frustration basically is not having their customer base," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, the local business improvement district. "The main thing is that they want their customers back."
Exactly how many distressed small retailers there are in the area is uncertain, Mr. Weisbrod said. Some, especially the ones closest to the twin towers, closed; others held on, but are still feeling the pain. "We haven't done a recent survey," Mr. Weisbrod said, "but I think a lot of businesses are off from where they were a year ago but are much better than they were in October, November and December."
A spokesman for the downtown alliance, Bryan Evans, said the group estimated that about 1,100 retail businesses were currently operating in the area below Chambers Street. "A number of businesses closed after 9/11," he said of the area, "but a lot have opened." There have been similar losses and upheavals in retailing north of Chambers Street, as in TriBeCa and Chinatown. 
Mr. Di Tillio, Mr. Boudouvas and Mr. Polychronakis agreed that things were better than in the first months after they reopened, but said they were still deeply and dangerously in the red.
They said they had managed to stay open by forgoing personal income from their revenue-starved businesses and using varying combinations of insurance proceeds, bank loans, and grants and loans from government and private programs. 
But they also said they were worried that large loans that they had taken out or applied for could cost them their homes -- required as collateral in their cases -- if their businesses failed. 
"I called the woman at the bank and raised the question that if I can't meet my payments, are they going to come after my house," Mr. Polychronakis said. He took out $100,000 in five-year loans in December, secured by the house in Astoria, Queens, where he lives with his wife and four children.
Like many of the area's troubled shop owners, the men complained about the time-consuming and often repetitive paperwork involved in seeking aid from the myriad of government and private grant and loan programs. "The amount of paperwork is outrageous," Mr. Di Tillio said. "I had my accountant do it, but I had to pay him $2,000."
Those administering the programs say they understand the frustrations, but that the information the programs seek is necessary to assure that the grants are warranted and the low-interest loans can be repaid.
But many may have to continue in the red before black ink is possible, Mr. Weisbrod suggested. He said that there were still 60,000 fewer workers in Lower Manhattan than before Sept. 11. While that is an improvement from the 100,000 jobs believed to have been lost immediately after the attack, there is still a deficit that can break a business that is based on a local clientele. 
Mr. Weisbrod also cited the reduced tourism that has affected the American economy in the last year or so, and his belief that "the message that downtown is fully open for business has not yet become clear to New Yorkers." 
Jeannine W. Chanes, a lawyer who advises From the Ground Up, a group of nearly 300 Lower Manhattan businesses -- more than half of them retail -- said of the retailers: "The closer they are to ground zero, the worse off they are. The smaller, the worse off, because larger businesses have more resources." 
Like Mr. Polychronakis, Mr. Di Tillio, 54, said he feared that the future of his home could be tied in with his attempts to save his business, Majestic Pizza. He said that the federal Small Business Administration had agreed to give him a $183,000 business loan, minus what he had collected from insurance and aid programs, but the requirement that he put up the house in Flushing, Queens, where he and his wife live, "makes me think twice" about accepting. Should the business not make it, "I don't want to lose two things," he said. 
Mr. Di Tillio said his average current revenue of about $3,500 a week, which translates to about $15,000 a month, makes it impossible to pay his full $12,000 a month rent along with his other expenses, including salary for two full-time workers. 
At this point he is "up to paying $4,000" in rent, he said, adding that his landlord has been very understanding. Before Sept. 11 he averaged $9,000 a week, and the pizzeria, which he has owned for five years, had seven full-time employees.
Mr. Boudouvas said that with revenue at his flower shop, New York Blossoms, down 40 percent from the $3,500 to $4,500 a week it took in before Sept. 11, it was hard for him and his partner, Ted Georgiopoulos, to pay their $4,500 monthly rent as well as some back rent that has accumulated since they reopened in late November. "I'm behind a little bit, but hopefully that will be taken care of by the end of the month, even if I have to use my credit cards," said Mr. Boudouvas, 38, who owns a home in Lynbrook, on Long Island.
Mr. Polychronakis, 61, said that before Sept. 11, revenue at each of his remaining Minas shoe repair shops -- at 40 Exchange Place and 164 Pearl Street -- had been up to $12,000 a month, but that these days, it was impossible to meet the $9,000 in monthly expenses at each shop. He said "loyalty to my people" made him want to retain the four workers he had at each shop. And his future, he said, is as much on the line as theirs. "I spent 25 years to establish my business," he said. "I'm too old to restart, and too young to retire."

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing New York: Manhattan: McCall Issues Budget Warning 

BYLINE:  By Diane Cardwell (NYT) 

 BODY:
 Even if New York City gets all of the assistance it has requested from Albany, Washington and the city's labor unions, it could still face a shortfall of $1 billion in the next fiscal year, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall warned yesterday. The gap could reach $2 billion without the requested assistance, according to Mr. 
McCall's review of the city's four-year financial plan. "With tax revenues coming up short and the economic recovery proceeding slowly, the reality is harsh," said Mr. McCall, a Democratic candidate for governor. On Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's weekly radio program yesterday, the mayor said: "Even if we have a reasonably robust improvement in the economy, the tax revenues aren't going to be enough. We're going to have to make some very hard choices next year." Diane Cardwell (NYT)

Schering-Plough Agrees To Pay $500 Million Fine
The drug maker Schering-Plough has agreed to pay a $500 million fine because of its repeated failure to fix problems in manufacturing dozens of drugs at four factories. If approved by the court, the agreement would impose, by far, the largest financial penalty on a drug company for failing to follow guidelines.
 The agreement relates to violations dating as far back as 1998 that inspectors have found at plants in New Jersey and Puerto Rico. The violations involve some 200 medicines, including Claritin, the allergy medicine that is Schering's top-selling product. Page A1. 

Bertelsmann in Deal for Napster
Bertelsmann, the German media giant, has agreed to pay $8 million for Napster, the file-swapping Internet service. As part of the deal, Napster executives who resigned earlier this week, including chief executive Konrad Hilbers, left, have agreed to return. Bertelsmann hopes to use Napster's technology to create a for-pay Internet service. C2.

Fed Changes Lending Practice
The Federal Reserve has proposed a substantial change in its system of lending directly to banks. The move appears to be an attempt to give the Fed more control over its efforts to stimulate or rein in the economy. C4.

In a report, the Treasury Department has urged lawmakers to stop companies from using offshore shelters to avoid income taxes. But the agency also warned that the problem could not be solved by legislation that simply outlawed overseas shelters. C4.

Ford Said to Reappoint Executive
Ford Motors is expected to name Allan D. Gilmour, who retired from the automaker in 1995, as its chief financial officer. The appointment would make him one of the highest-ranking executives in America who is openly gay. C3.

At Hershey's, a Question of Trust
For many years, the relationship between Hershey's Chocolate and its workers had been one based on trust. The current labor dispute, in which 2,700 workers have gone out on strike, is as much about an erosion of that trust as it is about wages and benefits. A8.

Russia Plans to End Oil Export Cuts
Russia has scrapped the oil export cuts that it agreed to in December after a push by OPEC and will allow flows of crude to rise to previous levels over the next two months. C2.

Stocks Post Modest Gains
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 63.87 points, at 10,353.08. The Nasdaq gained 10.95 points, to 1,741.39. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 8.36, to 1,106.59. For the week, the Dow rose 4.1 percent, the Nasdaq gained 8.8 percent and the S.& P. climbed 4.9 percent. C4.

Consumer Confidence Rises
Consumer sentiment rose in early May to its highest level in 18 months. The preliminary reading in the University of Michigan's index of consumer sentiment for May rose to 96.0, a level not seen since December 2000. The index had fallen to 93.0 in April. C2.

Japan Imposes Tariffs on U.S. Steel
Japan, joining with the European Union, has imposed duties on some imports of American steel. It is the first time Japan has imposed a tariff in a trade dispute, and it signifies the emergence of a coalition to combat what it perceives as protectionism in Washington. C2.

HEADLINE: Carter Urges Bush to Reject Plan to Aid Cuba Dissidents 

BYLINE:  By DAVID GONZALEZ 

DATELINE: HAVANA, May 17 

 BODY:
As the Bush administration prepares to announce a more aggressive policy against President Fidel Castro that could include channeling resources to dissidents, former President Jimmy Carter strongly warned today that such a move would be counterproductive.
 On the final day of a six-day visit, Mr. Carter said at a news conference this morning that dissidents he met with on Thursday "expressed deep concerns" that any direct help from the United States would help Mr. Castro discredit their efforts. 
 After a broad policy review, Mr. Bush is expected to announce new measures on Monday that could include providing assistance for dissidents, human rights advocates and independent journalists on the island.
"For them to be connected directly to the U.S. government, or indirectly to the U.S. government, for financing, would damage severely their integrity," Mr. Carter said, just before departing from Cuba.
While President Bush has said he is a friend to Cubans seeking democracy, dissidents here are uncomfortable with several points in what they have heard through the news media of his new policy. An adviser to Mr. Carter said that many dissidents favored lifting the four-decade-old trade embargo, which Mr. Bush is proposing to tighten.
Dissidents have said before that they reject United States aid because it would taint their efforts, especially the Varela Project, a petition drive seeking a referendum to gain increased freedoms. One of Mr. Castro's main arguments against the project is that it was a foreign creation.
Mr. Carter said the Cuban government would now have to decide how to respond to the petition campaign's demands. He urged it to allow public debate, after the state-run media published his speech, in which he endorsed the Varela project and criticized the Communist government for denying rights.
"I would say the millions of Cubans who now know about it for the first time will have their concerns assuaged by the proper actions of the government," Mr. Carter said.
"Will it be completely discounted? Will there be an open dialogue about it?"
Mr. Carter said he hoped that before President Bush announced his Cuba policy, the president would review a report Mr. Carter will send him on his conclusions from the trip, which included "extensive" discussions with Mr. Castro.
Mr. Carter today repeated his call for the United States to end the trade embargo and allow Americans to travel to Cuba. He said that greater cooperation among scientific researchers, especially, would help dispel any fears that the Cuban government was conducting research on biological weapons, as the State Department recently alleged.
Mr. Carter argued that trade and travel restrictions on Cuba should be removed because they restrain fundamental American freedoms.
"I think an American citizen or an American company has the right to visit any place on earth and the right to trade with any purchaser or supplier on earth," he said.
Mr. Carter said his delegation also brought along some 500 pages of declassified documents from the National Archives that detail his administration's efforts to ease relations with Cuba.
The rapprochement, which included the release of political prisoners and allowing travel to the island, collapsed over Cuba's refusal to remove its troops from Angola and Ethiopia.
Robert Pastor, who served as Mr. Carter's national security adviser on Latin America, said he hoped that the Cubans would declassify similar documents in order for both countries to study and learn from that era.
"Forty-three years of old habits are not easy to overcome," Mr. Pastor said. "But no one can any longer ignore the germ of the idea that there is an alternative to the insults and recriminations between the United States and Cuba."

HEADLINE: 1,000 British Marines Join Australians in Firefight With Suspected Taliban 

BYLINE:  By DAVID ROHDE 

DATELINE: BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan, May 17 

 BODY:
Nearly 1,000 British marines were airlifted this morning to a rugged corner of eastern Afghanistan where an Australian Special Forces patrol had come under heavy fire on Thursday afternoon from suspected Taliban fighters, American and British officials said today. 
 Several attackers were killed in the battles, north of Khost, which raged for several hours and included American airstrikes, the officials said. No coalition soldiers were wounded. American officials said 100 Taliban or Qaeda fighters were believed to be in the area. 
 The unexpected attack was the first combat after several weeks of sweeps near the Pakistani border by American, British, Canadian and Afghan soldiers that turned up almost no Taliban or Qaeda fighters. The current British-led mission is expected to last several days.
Afghan officials also reported that an unrelated American bombing near Khost killed nine people who appeared to have no ties to the Taliban and Al Qaeda. American officials said their planes had been fired on. 
In another development today, the United States and other donor countries meeting in Geneva agreed to give enough funds to begin the formation of the new Afghan police force and army.
An Arabic-language newspaper also reported today that it had received recorded statements said to be from the fugitive Taliban leader, Mullah Muhammad Omar. He is reported to have said that Osama bin Laden is alive, that the war in Afghanistan is not over and that American forces in Afghanistan will suffer "fire, hell and total defeat."
The newspaper, the London-based Asharq Al Awsat, said the statements were responses to questions it had submitted to Mullah Omar's aides. The veracity of the statements could not be verified.
British officials in Afghanistan said today's operation was purely in response to the attack on the Australian patrol. Brig. Roger Lane, the commander of the 1,700-member British contingent, said the Australians were fired on from locations historically used by the Taliban. 
Brig. Mike Hannan, a spokesman for the Australian military, said in Canberra that a heavy machine gun opened fire on a group of Special Forces soldiers, The Associated Press reported. The Australians believe they killed at least one Taliban fighter. 
A second group of Australians tried to link up with the first but came under fire four miles from the site of the clash. "They were able to fight their way through and join up, supported by air support from the U.S. Air Force, and then they were able to move to safety," Brigadier Hannan said.
American and British officials declined to give the exact location of the fighting, but said it was unfolding at elevations of more than 8,000 feet 10 to 30 miles north of Khost, away from the Pakistani border. Maj. Bryan Hilferty, an American military spokesman, said the coalition believed that 100 Taliban or Qaeda fighters were in the area. 
Coalition forces have destroyed large weapons caches during sweeps across eastern Afghanistan in recent weeks but have not seen large numbers of the Taliban or Al Qaeda. Many are believed to be hiding in tribal areas of neighboring Pakistan. 
The British contingent is also fighting an unknown contagious disease here that has infected 38 British soldiers. Several became so sick they were airlifted to Europe. British officials said the infections began among workers in the British field hospital here.
The American bombing that killed nine people today occurred in Sabari, about 30 miles north of Khost, Afghan officials there said. Government officials said someone fired at an American plane as two feuding clans met in the town to resolve a dispute. The planes then bombed the area. The Afghan officials said they did not know who fired at the plane. 
Other officials said that the clans had fired on each other, or that the shots were fired by revelers at a wedding, according to news reports. Residents of eastern Afghanistan have repeatedly complained of American air attacks that they say have killed civilians.
Major Hilferty, the American spokesman, defended the bombing, saying the planes were fired on first. "I can't say for sure that we did not fire at the wedding and we did not fire at these two tribes," he said tonight, according to The Associated Press. But, he added, "people were trying to kill us."
The renewed pledges of foreign aid came at a meeting of 35 countries at the United Nations offices in Geneva. No exact figures were released, but Lakhdar Brahimi, the United Nations special representative for Afghanistan, said enough had been pledged to begin work.
The United States has pledged to aid the training of an Afghan Army. Germany will help develop a police force. Britain will mount an antidrug campaign and Italy will work on an independent judicial system. But some Afghan officials have complained that foreign nations are failing to provide funds they promised months ago.

HEADLINE: Trump Cancels Bond Sale, Calling Rates Too High 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Failing to entice the financial markets, Donald J. Trump canceled a $470 million sale of bonds for his casinos yesterday because investors were demanding such high interest rates. 
 Investors have been willing to accept much lower rates on bonds of other casinos, but Mr. Trump's threat last fall to default on the debt of three of his Atlantic City casinos apparently left a bitter taste. At the time, Mr. Trump tried to force existing bondholders to accept a lower rate given the gloomy economic atmosphere after Sept. 11. He missed a deadline on an interest payment, but ultimately gave in and paid bondholders before the end of the grace period without securing a lower rate. 
 "That's a piece of it," said Mark A. Brown, president of Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts, which canceled the bond sale; it owns the Trump Plaza, Taj Mahal and Marina properties. If the bonds could have been sold at an interest rate closer to those on other casino bonds, he said, the sale would have gone through.
Mr. Brown and Mr. Trump said they expected to proceed with a bond sale later in the year when the casinos' performance would merit a better deal. "I am confident that a more attractive financing will be available to the company towards the end of this year," Mr. Trump said in a statement.
The planned offering of eight-year notes had been expected to yield 9.75 percent to 10 percent on a higher-rated $340 million portion and 12.75 percent to 13 percent on a $130 million portion, which carried a lower rating, according to investors interested in the proposal.
The market has generally been receptive, with the average yield on casino junk bonds at 8.5 percent, according to Merrill Lynch's high-yield index. And investors have been pouring money into junk bond mutual funds at twice the pace of a year ago, reflecting appetite for this high-yielding but risky debt.
"It is a great time for a junk bond issuer to issue," said Martin S. Fridson, chief high-yield strategist at Merrill Lynch. "And casinos are pretty much in favor right now."
Casino junk bond issues are yielding less, on average, than other junk bonds, Mr. Fridson said. Bond prices and yields move in the opposite direction, so a lower yield shows that investors want casino bonds enough to pay more for them. The junk bonds for casinos usually have a yield of a full percentage point less than all junk bonds, but right now, they are yielding three percentage points less, indicating strong demand, he said.
The proceeds from the sale by Mr. Trump's company were earmarked to pay off shorter-term debt. The company said in a statement that $67 million is due April 30 of next year but described it as "readily finance-able." A bigger portion, $242 million, comes due Nov. 15, 2003.
Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts made a considerable effort to warm investors on the bond issue. Mr. Brown said that Mr. Trump attended all the "roadshow" meetings with investors, and the terms were modified. At first, it was a single issue of $470 million, backed by the assets of the Trump Marina Casino Resort in Atlantic City and the Riverboat Casino in Indiana. When the expected yield was too high, two issues were created. The $340 million portion represented mortgage bonds that had first call on the casino assets. It was rated B- by Standard & Poor's and B3 by Moody's Investors Service. The other portion was a second-mortgage issue, with less security, that was rated CCC by S.& P. and Ca by Moody's.
Just this week, Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts added more assets to the lower-rated issue by pledging the revenues of the Trump 29 Casino, an Indian casino that Mr. Trump's organization manages in Palm Springs, Calif.

HEADLINE: Rain Keeps Up in Water-Logged Midwest 

BYLINE:  By JOHN W. FOUNTAIN 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 17 

 BODY:
Residents across Illinois, Indiana and Missouri braced for more flooding today as scattered showers continued. Even so, there was hope that sandbags would prevail against overflowing rivers that were already blamed for nine deaths in the past two weeks. 
 The governors of Illinois and Missouri declared states of emergency this week, as did officials in 15 Indiana counties. 
 Missouri was apparently the hardest hit, with eight deaths reported. In asking President Bush to declare 37 counties as disaster areas, Gov. Bob Holden cited the deaths and the loss of millions of dollars in property damage and to local economies. 
In Illinois, Senator Richard J. Durbin sent a letter to President Bush on Thursday asking him to declare the state a federal disaster area.
"We've got a serious problem facing us here, and I hope we get a response soon," Mr. Durbin said late today, adding that he had surveyed flooding downstate a week ago. "It's gotten progressively worse." 
The flooding has already affected thousands of residents in the region, forcing the evacuation of many and the closure of scores of roads.
Across the Midwest today, residents were looking for a rainbow, though all that existed for some on this dreary day was rain. 
In flood-weary towns, like Crystal City, Mo., about 30 miles south of St. Louis where the Mississippi River has spilled into downtown, the continued rain kept many volunteers stacking sandbags, hopeful that they would keep the water at bay. In Indiana, where Gov. Frank O'Bannon toured the central and southern parts of the state by helicopter this week, rivers and creeks flowed out of their banks. 
Today, scattered showers across Indiana added to some of the worst flooding the state has seen in at least six years. An above-normal rainfall this spring and heavy showers this month had swelled creeks and rivers. Hundreds of residents were driven from their homes or cut off by water on low-lying roads. Farmers, already behind on planting corn, were expecting more weeks of delays with many fields under water.
In the first flood-related death reported outside of Missouri, officials in Bath, Ill., said that Christian Turner, 8, drowned on Thursday after jumping out of a boat that had broken away from a mooring behind his house where he and two other boys were playing.
"He started drifting downstream and kind of panicked a little bit," said John Windsor of the Mason County Sheriff's Department. "The water was only like six feet, and the current, the way it is, it just makes it 10 times more dangerous." 
In Bath, and elsewhere across east central Illinois, volunteers stacked sandbags today, expecting the Illinois River to crest on Monday, officials said.
"It's starting to get a little worse," Mr. Windsor said late today.
Gov. George H. Ryan of Illinois issued a disaster declaration this week to provide state resources to respond to flooding. Illinois prison inmates filled sandbags at trouble spots, distributing at least 650,000 through today. 
In Missouri, two storm systems the past two weeks have left the Mississippi swollen, flooding low-lying areas, officials said. The heavy rainfall also raised the Missouri River, causing its tributaries to flood in the western part of the state. 
John Ogren, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Indianapolis, characterized the current flooding as serious, but not yet reaching the level of 1993 floods that devastated parts of the region. 
"If you are being impacted by this flood, it's serious," Mr. Ogren said. "But it doesn't have the same geographical scope as the 1993 floods."
He added: "In 1993, we had a lot of snowfall in the winter, so we had the heavy rains fall on top of the snow. This year, we didn't have a lot of snowfall. We started off reasonably dry." 
Mr. Ogren said forecasters predicted above-average rainfall for the Midwest through August. "We are not out of the woods yet," he said.
In Missouri, the rain had been expected to end by midday today -- but kept falling. It was forecast to continue through the weekend in parts of Illinois and Indiana.
The National Weather Service said that some sections of Indiana could see as much as four more inches of rain and that water levels in the region's rivers would remain high for the next week to 10 days.
By this evening, there was some good news in Crystal City, even with State Highway 67 under three feet of water from the Mississippi that fed into the Joachim Creek, spilling over. Officials said the river crested today at 37.2 feet, about 8 feet above flood stage. 
"It's about to clear up," Karry Friedmeyer, the city's superviser of streets. "It looks like we're just about to get out of the rain here. Hopefully, the flood waters will be receding here pretty soon."

HEADLINE: Smarter Sanctions on Iraq 

 BODY:
Visitors to Baghdad are quickly herded to the Saddam Hussein Children's Hospital for a look at what Iraqis say is the result of international trade sanctions -- sick and undernourished infants. Unicef says that in much of the country Iraqi children under age 5 are dying at more than twice the rate they did a decade ago. It's a heart-rending sight, as are the dilapidated cars and crumbling homes in a society that a generation ago enjoyed standards of living and welfare comparable to much of Europe. 
 The cause of the suffering, however, is less the sanctions than Mr. Hussein. Lavish palaces and gaudy monuments to his megalomania continue to go up while his people scrape by. 
 The sanctions, while far from flawless, have been aimed at preventing Mr. Hussein from rearming Iraq and threatening his neighbors again. As the years have passed since the Persian Gulf war, Russia, France and China have grown eager to resume trade with the oil-rich state. By last year the embargo was crumbling.
Then came Sept. 11, and with it a shifted international alliance and focus. By winter a new relationship was blossoming between Washington and Moscow, and an American-British proposal for a different approach to Iraqi sanctions was gaining ground. On Tuesday the United Nations Security Council passed the new plan by a vote of 15 to 0, a diplomatic victory for the United States. Now the world must persuade Iraq to permit the re-entry of weapons inspectors, barred since 1998. Many Middle Eastern and European governments reasonably say they want to give inspection efforts a try before there can be any talk of military action against Iraq. 
The revamped embargo is aimed at easing the entry into Iraq of civilian goods. Starting next month, instead of each import facing Security Council scrutiny, anything can get through that is not on a list of items with potential military use. Those items -- say, telecommunications equipment -- face special scrutiny but will not be stopped if they are deemed aimed at purely civilian use. It should now be harder for Mr. Hussein to blame the sanctions for the suffering of his people -- or at least harder for others to believe him. 
The original plan for the new sanctions was to include tighter controls on leakage across Iraq's borders with Turkey, Jordan and Syria. The controls have been abandoned partly because of pressure from those countries, which is a pity. Nonetheless, Washington is now in a better position to lead the international debate on the future of the Iraqi regime without the distraction of accusations over humanitarian concerns.

HEADLINE: What's the Ostrich For? Politics; 
Budget Protests Use Street Theater and Star Powers

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
The piercing whistle by an AIDS protester being arrested outside Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's famous bullpen-style office. Schoolchildren delivering boxes of letters to City Hall complaining about the loss of teachers and programs to budget cuts. A woman parading around in an ostrich suit, calling herself the Bloombird, asking the mayor to consider tax increases instead of some budget cuts.
 These are the sounds and sights at City Hall this spring, as the mayor and the City Council wrangle over how to close a roughly $5 billion budget shortfall, the city's most serious fiscal problem since the 1970's. 
 Since budget protests are not exactly novel in New York, the challenge organizers face in this superlean year is to capture the attention of the public, the press and the city's many newly elected leaders to make the case that this year the cuts will hurt, and that they are not crying wolf. 
"Most of the demonstrators are media savvy -- we are in the media capital of the world -- and most people know that there is a pitch and a volume to this work," said Gail B. Nayowith, the executive director of the Citizens' Committee for Children, a child advocacy organization. "You have to find the right balance to get heard above the din, but it's important not just to be heard, but to be heard correctly."
The mayor originally called his budget "a spread-the-pain" approach, so it is no surprise that many groups are now complaining. His budget called for cutting money for schools, some of which was restored in the state budget deal this week. It also sought to close centers for the elderly, halt the city's glass and plastic recycling program, reduce the size of the police force through attrition and cut youth programs.
For many groups, the strategy for battling budget cuts employs a variety of techniques. Behind closed doors, advocates for education, children, the elderly, people with AIDS, parks, libraries and the environment lobby the Bloomberg administration and the Council to make the case for protecting their projects and programs. Out in the streets they try to draw the crowds to get noticed. In some cases, protest organizers say, they are encouraged by council members, and even some mayoral aides, who want to gauge support for the demonstrators' causes.
That is where the pressure to grab attention comes in.
One way is to tap star power. Have Cynthia Nixon, a star of "Sex in the City" with a daughter in public school, speak out against school cuts. Have Ms. Nixon hold a news conference in favor of raising taxes, accompanied by other New York celebrities, like the playwright Eric Bogosian and the singer Audra McDonald. Plan a weeklong series of protests. Have Ms. Nixon, parents, advocates for public schools, and other celebrities get arrested for blocking a gate at City Hall.
Some City Hall veterans say that they have not seen so many protests since the souring economy squeezed the budget during the Dinkins years. Of course Rudolph W. Giuliani banned most large protests from the steps of City Hall for years (but welcomed rallies for, say, the Yankees) until a federal judge struck down his restrictions. Now the steps of City Hall have resumed their role as New York City's own version of Speaker's Corner in Hyde Park.
Many of the recent protests have been organized by a coalition that includes the Working Families Party; New York Acorn, a community group; and the Alliance for Quality Education. Aided by e-mail lists, they have been able to tap the anger many parents feel about budget cuts.
It was no coincidence that the groups staged five days of education rallies this week as the state finished its own budget negotiations, which included debates about restoring money cut from the city's schools. 
Children from schools in every borough complained about cuts. Parents said that they would be willing to pay more taxes to stave off the cuts. They tried a candlelight vigil in a driving rain. They dropped off letters. They held up signs, including one that evoked Lyndon B. Johnson and the Vietnam War: "Hey Mike, what do you say? How many schools have you hurt today?" And some chanted "Education first!" a slogan that just happens to be the title of the City Council's budget proposal, which calls for a tax increase to improve education.
Some of the street theater is recycled. That Bloombird ostrich suit, for example, was originally used against Rick A. Lazio during his campaign for the Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton. Then, protesters urged Mr. Lazio to "take his head out of the sand" regarding the economy of upstate New York. Now protesters are urging Mr. Bloomberg to take his head out of the sand when it comes to raising taxes. 
Organizers say the fact that the protests are, well, organized, should not detract from their significance. 
"It's not like we're storming City Hall to take it over," said Daniel Cantor, the executive director of the Working Families Party. "We're storming it to get our picture in the paper, and hoping to send a message to the City Council at the same time."
The challenge many protest leaders face is to strike the right tone in the post-Sept. 11 world, in which many people acknowledge that shared sacrifices are needed and much political dissent has taken on a muffled tone. 
Once, the message was "Don't Cut Us" or "Don't Cut Us, Cut Something Else."
"In the past it felt more like a squeaky wheel kind of problem," said Jon Kest, the head organizer for Acorn. "If the wheel squeaked, the money would be restored because it was there."
The new message is "Don't Cut Us, Raise Taxes." This way, protesters say, the groups are not competing with one another so much; they are simply asking businesses and the wealthy to share in the sacrifices. 
But Mayor Bloomberg has resisted raising taxes, except for a steep increase in the cigarette tax that he promotes as an antismoking measure. His aides note that instead, they are borrowing $1.5 billion, an undesirable financial practice that they say is justified because of the events of Sept. 11. Without that borrowing, they note, the cuts would be far worse. (The mayor has not ruled out raising taxes next year.)
Then there is the contingency plan, the mayor's proposal for $500 million more in cuts in case some pieces of his budget plan do not fall into place. 
Several advocates and organizers said in interviews that they thought that the current City Council, with 38 of its 51 members new to the office, had welcomed them and listened to them more. The Council's budget calls for some taxes and for restoring money from many of the cuts.
When Ms. Nixon, the actress, was arrested on Tuesday as she protested the cuts to her daughter's school, two councilmen, Bill Perkins of Manhattan and Charles Barron of Brooklyn, paused to thank her and her colleagues before they were gently handcuffed and led off by the police.
"This is a mayor who told us privately that there is no discontent about his budget because he hasn't seen anybody protesting at City Hall," Mr. Barron said. "You don't know the profound impact you're going to have on our job inside. So when we get inside and have to do our negotiating, we're able to see that your sacrifice today is going to push the negotiations forward."

 BODY:
 Summer brings many vacation choices, so operators of cruise ships, river barges and other vessels often try to put together deals to get you onto the water.

CRUISING THE WEB -- Special pricing is offered by eWaterways.com for two seven-day barge cruises in France departing July 13. The 50-passenger Anacolouthe will cruise the Seine and Yonne Rivers with stops at Monet's home and gardens at Giverny, the Chateau Vaux-le-Vicomte, the palace at Fontainebleau and the Gothic cathedral at Auxerre in Burgundy. The price of $1,990 a couple is half the normal high-season rate. It includes all meals, wines, sightseeing and transfers between the barge and Paris. Air fare between most United States cities and Paris is included with a trip on the 50-passenger Provence, departing from Lyon on July 13 to cruise along the Rhone with stops at Avignon, the Roman ruins in Arles and St.-Remy de Provence, and the walled medieval city of Aigues-Mortes. Rates: $2,690 to $3,090 a person, double occupancy. For more information: (800) 676-6613 or www.bargespecials.com.

THIRD PASSENGER FREE -- On all seven-night sailings July 14 to Aug. 18, the 170-passenger tall ship Star Clipper will allow the third passenger in triple-occupancy cabins to travel free. Rates for the first two passengers start at $993 each, including port charges. For those who believe three's a crowd, there are two-for-one air-fare deals out of New York on some departures (the two offers cannot be combined). The Star Clipper departs Barbados on Sundays and stops in Martinique, Antigua, St. Lucia St. Barts and other ports. Availability is limited, and air fare is extra. Call (800) 442-0551 or visit www.starclippers.com.

RUNNING AWAY -- The 320-passenger Paul Gauguin, which sails Tahiti and nearby islands, is including round-trip economy air fare from 82 North American cities, including New York, on seven-night departures June 8 and 22. Ports of call include Raiatea, Tahaa, Bora-Bora and Moorea. Prices per person, based on double occupancy, start at $2,895. For more information: (866) 213-1272 or on the Web at www.rssc.com.

LAND OF THE FJORDS -- Norwegian Coastal Voyage has reduced the prices of various packages that include cruises along the Norwegian coast, hotels in Oslo and Bergen, rail travel between those cities and air fare from New York. For example, a 15-day plan that includes a round-trip cruise aboard the Finnmarken or Trollfjord from Bergen has been discounted $115 to $125 -- to $3,570 to $4,535 a person, double occupancy -- through this year. Each ship carries cargo in addition to about 650 passengers. Both are new for 2002. Information: (800) 323-7436 or www.coastalvoyage.com. JOSEPH SIANO

HEADLINE: Life Without Parole? 

BYLINE:  By Jennifer Gonnerman; Jennifer Gonnerman is a staff writer for The Village Voice. She is working on a book about a woman's return home from prison.

 BODY:
At the parole office on West 40th Street in Manhattan, Tuesdays are always busy. Parolees begin lining up on the sidewalk at 8 a.m., 20 minutes before the front door opens. By 8:30, most of the 80 seats in the waiting room are filled. Men greet each other by slapping palms, and the noise level rises throughout the morning. "A criminal social club," a supervisor mutters, surveying the scene with a 9-millimeter pistol hidden beneath his jacket. 
 One Tuesday afternoon, John Scott, a 37-year-old former drug dealer, walked into the waiting room to check in with his parole officer. Tuesday is "report day" for parolees assigned to Manhattan III, the parole bureau covering West Harlem and Washington Heights, and Scott was living with his mother in her fourth-story apartment in West Harlem. He left Attica prison 58 days earlier. 
 Compared with many of the parolees sprawled on the chairs in this waiting room, Scott was thriving. He had been home for only a month when a friend told him about an opening at Copeland's, a popular soul food restaurant on West 145th Street. Scott filled out an application and got a job washing pots. 
The job paid just $5.50 an hour, but Scott managed to look as if he wasn't broke. He had on jeans and a denim jacket bearing the trendy Rocawear label. No one would confuse him with the men who had just left prison, the ones who showed up at the parole office straight from Port Authority, lugging their possessions in a garbage bag. They wore plain sweatshirts and logo-less denim pants, the standard parting gifts of the New York State prison system.
In the hallway next to the waiting room, Scott described his plans for the coming months. "There are sacrifices I have to make," he explained, chewing a wad of grape gum. "Everyone's got their job they got to do. The parole officer has their job. I have to abide by the rules they set up. If I don't, I'm never going to be able to pay back." 
Scott was no longer in prison, but he was also not completely free. "Paying back" his debt to society would mean staying out of trouble -- obeying the many rules that govern the life of a parolee -- until his parole concluded in 2007. According to Scott, when he walked out of Attica, he left prison for good. "I'm getting too old for all this," he said. 
An officer walked down the corridor, and Scott looked up. "P.O. Field, how's it going?" he said. To me, Scott explained, "This is my parole officer from before." Like many of his fellow parolees, Scott is a veteran of the parole system. His first visit to this office was in 1995, after he spent four and a half years in prison for selling cocaine. He was still on parole in 1998 when he was arrested for another cocaine sale and sent back to prison for three and a half years.
There may be no better sign that our criminal justice system is broken than a parole office where the new parolees already know the officers by name. Originally conceived as a one-way system of oversight and rehabilitation, parole today often functions like a circular conveyor belt, delivering recently freed people straight back to the penitentiary. Across the country, 725,000 men and women are on parole or a similar type of post-prison supervision. About 40 percent of ex-prisoners are back behind bars within three years of their release. 
People are spending years, sometimes decades, cycling in and out of parole offices and prisons, seemingly unable to escape the grip of the criminal justice system. A 2001 study gave them a new moniker: "churners." The question of what happens to men and women when they leave prison has never been as urgent as it is today. In 2002, America is expected to release a record 630,000 prisoners -- a population larger than that of Milwaukee, Boston or Washington. 
A surprising number of the parolees returning to prison each year -- about half, according to Justice Department officials -- have not been convicted of a new crime. Rather, they are sent back for disobeying one or more of parole's rules. Parolees cannot use drugs, stay out past curfew (usually 9 or 10 p.m.), skip appointments with their parole officers, hang out with anyone who has a criminal record, leave the state without permission or spend the night anywhere except their approved residences. 
By cracking down on parolees who break these rules -- who commit so-called technical violations -- parole officers have helped keep prison cots full during an era of lowered crime rates. In 1999, parole violators made up 35 percent of people entering state prison, up from 17 percent in 1980.
Today technical violations are at the center of a complicated, highly charged debate about the future of parole supervision -- about how the system fails and whether it can be fixed. Experts debate the topic on the pages of academic journals and on panels at criminal justice conferences. In recent years, the chorus of critics has grown louder and more diverse. No longer does it include only predictable voices, like those of prisoners' rights attorneys. Now some criminal justice insiders, including many who have spent their careers trying to make the parole system work, are arguing for serious reform. Critics have suggested a wide range of solutions, including some radical ones, like significantly reducing the number of people on parole or even ending parole supervision altogether. 
Imprisoning parolees who commit technical violations is supposed to prevent future crimes, but the effectiveness of this strategy is difficult to demonstrate. "There is no research that violative behavior is a precursor to criminal activity," says Michael P. Jacobson, former commissioner of both New York City's Department of Correction and Department of Probation. Locking up parolees who break parole's rules may make sense intuitively, he says, "but there's nothing that says that a guy who is starting to smoke marijuana again is about to bump someone on their head and take their pocketbook."
To understand the pressures of being a parole officer, you need only remember Willie Horton or Jack Henry Abbott. Parole officers know they will not be punished if they send too many people back to prison -- but they will if they fail to lock up a parolee and his mug shot pops up on the 11 p.m. news. And so, every day, officers send parolees back to prison for offenses that are not crimes.
One critic of this practice is Martin F. Horn, former executive director of the New York State Division of Parole, who says he believes that too many parolees are returning to prison for technical violations, a practice with a huge cost. A day in a New York City jail costs $175; the price tag for a year in a New York state prison is $32,000. "If tomorrow all the parole officers in New York City were taken on a cruise for a month, would there be an appreciable change in the crime rate?" Horn asks. "To spend that kind of money, you'd have to be able to say there definitely would be."
The waiting room at the West 40th Street parole office looks more like a rest stop on the journey back to prison than a bridge to the free world. Wanted posters decorate the bulletin board. Handwritten signs cover the windows: "No visitors, No wives, No girlfriends, No children, No friends, No mothers, fathers, aunts, uncles or cousins." Mounted on a back wall, a wooden rack labeled Parolee Information is empty except for a few gum wrappers and two chewed-up lollipop sticks.
The people filling the hard plastic seats in this room offer a fairly accurate snapshot of the nation's parolee population. Most are African-American or Latino. Almost all are male; only 9 percent of New York's parolees are female. Many spend their nights on a cot at a city shelter. And about 70 percent of New York's parolees do not have a high-school degree.
Walking through the parole office, you can't miss the evidence of parole's lowly status. Parole officers do not have computers, so they must hand-write all their notes, often recording the same information on three or four different forms. A secretary prepares warrants on an electric typewriter, correcting mistakes with white-out. And parole officers drive parolees back to jail in an aging Oldsmobile whose main precaution against escape is child-safety locks.
Parole agencies are trapped in a "huge policy tautology," according to Jacobson, now a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. "You don't give them any money, so they can't do their jobs," he says. "So you have all these high-profile incidents happen where the reaction is, 'Well, you're not doing your job, so we're going to give you less money.' "
Across the country, many parole officers have seen their caseloads grow significantly over the last two decades. Today some parole officers oversee 70 or more people. A parole officer with a 70-person caseload has about half an hour a week to devote to each parolee. Subtract the minutes an officer spends on paperwork, testifying in court and traveling to parolees' homes and jobs, and "parole supervision" begins to look like a misnomer.
By 4 p.m. on this Tuesday, Officer Pamela Howell had already met with 16 men and 2 women. She returned to the waiting room and scanned her parolees' sign-in sheet. 
"Scott!" she shouted.
John Scott followed Officer Howell down a grimy corridor, past a row of small rooms where other officers were interrogating their parolees. When they first meet her, most parolees tell Officer Howell, "You don't look like a parole officer." She was wearing a long black skirt with a slit up one side, black heels, a denim jacket, pink nail polish and a tiny silver stud in her nose. Almost every report day, at least one of her parolees tries to flirt with her. When Scott first spied her in the waiting room, he thought about approaching her. "I was getting ready to ask her name," he said. "Then I thought: Hold it. Hold it. That's my P.O." 
Officer Howell last saw Scott a few days earlier, when she stopped by his job late one night. "She was looking to catch me," Scott said with a grin. Officer Howell had given him permission to stay out past curfew, but only as long as he was working. 
The parole officer and parolee chatted for a minute, and then she launched into her standard set of four questions:
"Any police contact?" she asked.
"No," he said.
"Any problems or changes?"
"No."
"Any drugs?"
"No."
"Same employment?"
"Yeah. You want to see my pay stub?"
Officer Howell jotted down Scott's answers and photocopied his pay stub. Fifty-eight percent of New York's parolees are unemployed, so Officer Howell tries to offer encouragement to those parolees who do manage to find a job. "You're doing the right thing," she told Scott. "I'm really proud of you."
The meeting lasted only a few minutes, then Officer Howell escorted Scott back to the waiting room. This afternoon, plenty of other people needed her attention more than he did. At the moment, her 70-parolee caseload included a stroke victim with a severe limp who was facing eviction; a heroin addict who stopped taking his H.I.V. meds because he did not like the side effects; a former drug dealer who staggered into her office reeking of beer; and a mentally ill woman who hears voices telling her to kill. 
There was a time when parole officers played a more active role in their parolees' lives, helping them navigate government bureaucracies and sometimes even driving them to drug programs or job interviews. Today officers' ability to help is largely limited to delivering pep talks and handing out referrals. Still, before the end of her workday at 8 p.m., Officer Howell had found a rehab program for her drunk parolee, lectured the H.I.V.-positive man about taking his pills and urged the mentally ill woman not to give up on drug treatment. 
Parole has been a cornerstone of America's criminal justice system since the early 20th century. The original hope was that by rewarding well-behaved prisoners with early release -- and by supervising them once they returned home -- the criminal justice system could rehabilitate them. But long ago, that goal fell out of favor, and legislators began chipping away at the parole system. Sixteen states have abolished their parole boards. Four more states have eliminated parole release for certain violent felons.
Today the post-prison supervision system is rife with inconsistencies. Oregon, for example, supervises virtually everyone exiting its prisons; Florida monitors only about half. There are also huge differences between states in how rigidly they control ex-prisoners. The most punitive state is California, which has about 120,000 parolees and locks up around 70,000 of them each year for technical violations.
The disparities between states are fodder for parole's critics. "Our traditional way of managing parole supervision is intellectually bankrupt," says Jeremy Travis, former director of the National Institute of Justice, the research arm of the Justice Department. Travis was the lead author of "From Prison to Home," a report published last year by the Urban Institute. "We don't have a clear idea of what we want this agency to do and why," he says about parole. "It has lost its public legitimacy, which is the necessary grounding for any public agency."
Such criticisms rile parole officials. "What would you prefer?" asks Martin Cirincione, executive director of the New York State Division of Parole. "Someone who's been convicted of a crime, and very often a violent crime, coming out with no supervision, no treatment, no link to resources, no enforcers? Or would you prefer to have that person supervised?"
For parolees, the task of rebuilding their lives has become much more difficult in recent years, at the same time that parole officers have less time to help them. Congress eliminated Pell grants for prisoners in 1994 despite numerous studies showing that higher education reduces recidivism. As a result, almost every prison college program was shut down. Without a college degree, former prisoners have little chance of earning much more than minimum wage. Even low-skill jobs are difficult to obtain for somebody with a felony record. And public housing agencies can ban anyone with a criminal record, leaving vast numbers of parolees with nowhere to live.
At the same time, the population of people leaving prison has become even more needy. An estimated 16 percent of state prisoners are seriously mentally ill; every parole officer in the West 40th Street office seems to oversee a few. These officers have few options when a schizophrenic or manic-depressive person does not obey their rules. Finding these parolees a slot at a treatment program can take several months. 
One report day, I watched as a mentally ill man, who had been arrested recently for marijuana, met with his parole officer. Another, more stable parolee might have received a stern lecture, but there was little debate about whether this man should go back to jail. "We don't want a subway pusher," said the supervisor who signed his warrant. "He's not a guy who I would throw the dice on."
The favorite buzzword inside the West 40th Street parole office is "public safety." "We don't work for the people we interact with," says Dan Culleton, bureau chief for Manhattan III. "We work for the people who pay us." Under Gov. George E. Pataki, the state's parole officers have become stricter. The number of parolees locked up annually for technical violations has more than doubled in the last decade, from 6 to 13 percent.
Over several weeks, I watched officers whisk a few dozen people out of the building in handcuffs. Some of these parolees were very hard to sympathize with. Thirty-year-old Darrell had been arrested for shoplifting a few days earlier. A review of Darrell's file revealed that he had once been involved in a fatal shootout. "It's much more than the average level of violence," Culleton says, "so he's got to go." 
On another Tuesday afternoon, a 24-year-old parolee named Terrence sat slumped in a chair in the hallway outside the row of report rooms. A pair of steel cuffs held his wrists together. Terrence had been living at a homeless shelter in Brooklyn, or at least that's what he told his parole officer. When the officer visited a few days earlier, Terrence's name was missing from the shelter registry. 
The officer suspected Terrence was actually living with family in New Jersey -- probably a more stable home than the drug-infested shelter. But this qualified as a parole violation, since parolees cannot leave the city or live out of state without permission. 
Two months earlier, Terrence left prison after completing a 12-month sentence for drug possession. It is difficult to imagine how sending him back to jail improves public safety. But the parole rule requiring parolees to disclose their address seems to have less to do with preventing crime than with ensuring that officers can perform their jobs. "How can the parole officer make home visits if he doesn't know where you live?" says Horn, the former parole official.
Parole officers have a great deal of discretion, but they are also supposed to enforce every rule. As a result, Horn says, way too many parolees return to prison for what he calls "housekeeping" violations, like skipping appointments with their officers. "Why do we require a person to report to his parole officer?" he asks. "Because you can't do the so-called supervision if you can't see the parolee. The only reason that rule exists is to facilitate the relationship between the parole officer and the parolee." 
The decision to send parolees like Terrence back to jail also has significant financial repercussions. "No one in government, at least no one I know of, can spend money like a parole officer," says Professor Jacobson, who is conducting a national study of parole. "You give this agency and its officers nothing, but that same officer who works with a yellow pad in some crummy office . . . can just violate" -- imprison on a technical violation -- one person a week and spend $2 million." He adds: "No one looks at this. Nobody. Not even their supervisors. Everybody is too busy."
Two months after John Scott landed the job at Copeland's, he quit. He complained that scrubbing pots left him with an aching back, that he earned less than $200 a week after taxes, that working both weekend nights interfered with his ability to have a love life. "I don't see nobody," he said. "It occupied all my time, and I didn't get no money out of it. That's not a job."
Scott did not have another job lined up, but he was confident he would find work. He did not at first seem worried about the ailing local economy or his own lack of a high-school diploma. But the next months did not turn out quite the way Scott had hoped. His relationship with his parole officer began to show signs of strain in December, when she started pressuring him to get a job. "Idle time kills these guys," Officer Howell says.
Then, in January, Officer Howell received a troubling phone call from Scott's girlfriend, who said that he had beaten her up. Officer Howell takes a zero-tolerance policy approach to domestic violence, and she wanted to arrest Scott the next time she saw him. But his girlfriend was reluctant to testify against him, and without her help, Officer Howell could not send Scott to jail.
Over the next few months, Scott's relationship with his parole officer got worse. By the time Officer Howell decided to lock him up, he had racked up several technical violations, including three drug tests that showed cocaine use and one missed parole appointment. He had also been arrested for a drug sale. Scott told Howell that he was not guilty -- the case has not yet been resolved -- but she could not overlook the fact that the incident occurred at almost 2 a.m., well past his curfew. 
"Maybe he started thinking he could do the street thing all over again," Officer Howell said. One week, Scott told Howell that he had won about $1,200 playing the numbers. On his lucky days, gambling proved far more lucrative, and much less onerous, than washing pots at Copeland's.
"I am really disappointed in that guy," Officer Howell said. "Sooner or later, they get too old, and they say, 'I can't do this no more.' I don't know what it'll take for Scott to get there, but he's not there yet."
Last summer, Martin F. Horn tossed a hand grenade into the debate over parole's future when he published an article in a trade journal calling for an end to the current parole system. Plenty of other people have suggested eliminating parole, but this latest attack stung local parole officials. After all, Horn spent 16 years at New York's parole agency, climbing the ladder from parole officer to executive director. (After leaving in 1995, Horn oversaw Pennsylvania's prison system and is now commissioner of the New York City Department of Probation.) 
If Horn had his way, there would be no more technical violations, since people would return to prison only if they committed a new crime. "Prison is our most expensive criminal justice resource," he says. "We should always ask ourselves: 'Are we getting a return on our money from an investment point of view? And can we get a similar or better return through another alternative?' " Horn's suggestion: Open halfway houses for newly freed people and set up a voucher system that would enable them to purchase the services they need, like drug treatment.
Most experts believe Horn's plan is more provocative than practical, that politicians would never agree to eliminate parole supervision for all felons. Indeed, earlier this year, after The Boston Globe reported that most people leaving Massachusetts prisons are unsupervised, Gov. Jane Swift promised to establish mandatory post-prison supervision.
But reducing the number of parolees imprisoned for technical violations doesn't necessarily mean eliminating parole supervision altogether. In 2000, legislators in Kansas decreased the amount of time that low-level felons spend on parole; already its parolee population has shrunk by one-third. Another idea some experts have floated is "goal-oriented" parole, which would reward parolees who meet certain goals by letting them off parole early. These sorts of changes could help out cash-strapped states, including California, which spends close to $900 million a year locking up its technical violators, according to Professor Jacobson.
But technical violations are just one piece of a much larger public policy puzzle: what to do with the hundreds of thousands of people now leaving prison? There is no shortage of ideas for how to improve the rate of recidivism: prepare prisoners for their release better and earlier; train them for jobs that pay more than minimum wage; teach them all to read and write. These ideas are hardly novel, but implementing them will require a radical shift in what we expect of our criminal justice system -- not just to punish felons but also to help them rebuild their lives after prison.
It will also require that we begin to embrace an uncomfortable truth. We spend nearly all of our criminal justice dollars on turning citizens into prisoners -- on sending men and women to prison and keeping them there -- and very little on trying to turn those prisoners back into citizens. Yet nearly everyone who goes to prison eventually comes out. While experts continue debating what to do with our ex-prisoners, new parolees arrive at the West 40th Street office every week, with a garbage bag of possessions and hope for a new beginning. 
One Tuesday late last month, at the beginning of their regular weekly meeting, Officer Howell snapped a pair of cuffs around Scott's wrists and arrested him for violating the terms of his parole. It was his 268th day home from prison. They talked for a while in her office, and then she drove him to the Manhattan House of Detention. Scott did not put up a fight. Instead, he acted as if he did not mind going back to jail, as if he thought the whole situation was some sort of joke. "Why are you laughing?" Officer Howell said. "This isn't funny. I hope you're just laughing to keep from crying." 
Officer Howell figures she will see Scott again in the not-too-distant future. "He'll be sitting in the waiting room on somebody else's caseload," she says.

HEADLINE: THE WAY WE LIVE NOW: 5-19-02: ON LANGUAGE;

BYLINE:  By William Safire 

 BODY:
Are you in favor of same-sex marriage? Have you recently gone through wrong-site surgery leading to a near-death experience? Do you search a drop-down menu to find a with-it shop so that you can look (to use a compound adverb) drop-dead gorgeous in your bare-midriff dress? 
 When the vogue for compound adjectives was just getting under way, the hyphenated terms were usually literal: a white-collar worker wore a white shirt to the office, and a blue-collar worker's collar at the factory was often blue. The literal meaning is expressed today in disco-inspired tees (formerly T-shirts) and Gucci's under-the-breast corset. But the hyphenations could also be metaphoric: lace-curtain Irish required some knowledge of social history, much as baby-boom generation does today. Early on, the precedent was established permitting the stringing-together of several words: the going-out-of-business sale of the Depression is matched in word number by out-of-the-box thinking today. 
 Now the hyphenation of modifiers rules the linguistic roost. This rule-roosting device -- See? Nothing to it -- satisfies the need for the new: "Hyphenation gives the impression," says Frank Abate, former editor in chief of the U.S. Dictionaries program at Oxford University Press, "that the compound is novel, imaginative or requires some background knowledge." He notes that some of these double-word modifiers grow out of adverbial phrases: in "technology at the cutting edge," the adverbial phrase is swung around in front of the noun to become cutting-edge technology; in the same way, "you can track changes in real time" becomes real-time data.
The compression of modification suits headline writers and e-mail correspondents, whose shortness of space or haste in composition makes them the language's leading squeezers. A statement like "a host is on duty at our Web site continuously" is whittled down to 24/7/365-hosting. Some compound adjectives are dying: push-button convenience is passe, and solid-state electronics, which substitutes transistors for vacuum tubes, is not needed in an age that assumes vacuum to be a noun for a device that sucks up dirt. State-of-the-art anything died from overuse, and world-class is out of the competition, falling back into the nonce-word category. And parody has weakened industrial-strength.
I am not the only language maven to notice this. At Astrakhan State Pedagogical University, located in the Volga River delta, Maya Ryashchina had found three patterns: noun plus postpositive, as in hands-on manager and heads-up tennis; verb plus postpositive, as in drive-by killing; and a modal verb plus infinitive, as in can-do mentality, must-have wine and must-see film. (Go, Astrakhan S.P.U.!)
Euphemizers have reached out for compound adjectives. Adults of generous girth or a tendency toward obesity (whom the insensitive used to call "fat people") wear big-and-tall clothes for men, plus-size for women.
The soul-satisfying impetus for our compound-modifying discourse . . . it's getting to me . . . begin again. The biggest boost to the use of hyphenated adjectives in the way we write has come from the military. In that target-rich environment, we find the World War II use of company-grade and field-grade officers. In the 1960's, zero-defect quality control and zero-tolerance policies made their mark, promptly picked up by politicians. "An unfortunate inclusion in the U.S. legislation," biologists observed at the Royal Society of London in 1967, "was the use of the term 'zero tolerance,' which implied a nil residue level." (In the scandal affecting the Catholic Church today, a zero-tolerance policy toward pedophile priests is in the headlines.)
What single term epitomizes the triumph of the compound adjective? The hands-down winner (in the old days, I would have written, "The winner, hands down," and come to think of it, that's more emphatic) is weapons-grade. 
This was coined in a 1952 policy statement by the Atomic Energy Commission calling for "nuclear plants which are economically independent of government commitments to purchase weapons grade plutonium." It was not then hyphenated; that was done a year later by the scientist George L. Weil, the colleague of Enrico Fermi at the University of Chicago who physically initiated the first nuclear chain reaction. Weil started a linguistic chain reaction as well: the meaning became "fissionable material of a quality for use in nuclear weapons," and its serious meaning now applies to biological agents as well.
As with all horrific words, it was quickly absorbed into popular culture. Voted the "catch-all superlative" of last year by the American Dialect Society, weapons-grade has been used to modify everything from a Toyota's torque output to Elvis Presley's charisma. Allan Metcalf, the Dialect Society's executive secretary, explains, "Weapons-grade salsa would mean really hot."

STOVEPIPING
The new bete noire of the military, and of the most modern managers, is stovepiping.
"Flat organizations work better than vertical organizations," decrees the Pentagon's manpower analysis handbook. "It should be noted that stovepiping is not inherently evil, but the burden of proof should be on the stovepiping function to demonstrate that it is not."
Lt. Gen. Ed Rowny, retired, urged in The Wall Street Journal that Tom Ridge, director of the Office of Homeland Security, be given authority to order widely dispersed bureaucracies into coordinated action. Ridge's present problem? "Rampant stovepiping -- different agencies under different command."
Rowny was present at the time of the creation of the word. When he was working for James Forrestal in forming the Defense Department in 1947, he notes, "we all went up and down our particular chain of command, but when it came time for the Army to cooperate with the Navy, we'd stovepipe -- go up to the top of the pipe and then back down, instead of cross feeding."
The noun stovepipe is a vertical cylinder carrying a stove's smoke up through the roof. As an adjective modifying "hat," it describes the tall top hat that Lincoln wore. Now that business schools use the participle form, stovepiping, in derogation of managers who fail to look around, the question arises: what do rising managers call horizontal cooperation that avoids direction from the top? Floorboarding comes to mind, but other entries will be considered at OnLanguage@nytimes.com.

HEADLINE: From Ruin to Renovation, Philipsburgh Hall Bustles Again 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA STEWART 

 BODY:
IF you are in downtown Yonkers past 4:30 and want a cup of coffee, let alone a beer, you are pretty much out of luck. Even in the dead of winter, the shops and lunch spots on and around Getty Square close well before dark.
 But the recent, meticulous restoration of Philipsburgh Hall -- a crumbling but impressive historic building -- has been attracting people with concerts and lessons in swing, salsa and ballroom dancing. A few weeks ago, people from all over Westchester drove to hear a jazz quartet from Juilliard, filling the Philipsburgh concert room for the first time in decades. The performances scheduled for the summer through the winter at the Philipsburgh Performing Arts Center range from an Aeschylus tragedy to jazz guitar and Irish music. 
 "We wanted to reconnect people to what it was," said Charles G. Lief, president of the Greyston Foundation, a nonprofit community group that co-owns the building. "And we wanted the community to have a place for performances that's not a school gym."
A contingent of painters, musicians and writers have moved into 28 newly restored apartments in the building. Most are from Manhattan and Brooklyn, said Mr. Lief, and were attracted by relatively low rents set aside for artists, as well as the marble halls and sweeping views of the Hudson River.
"The myth is that artists are always on the front edge of neighborhood revivals," he said. "We hope that's what's going to happen here. They're bringing a whole new energy here."
At the turn of the century, the streets of downtown Yonkers were filled with bustle and energy. When Philipsburgh Hall opened in 1905, the city was a major manufacturing center, with more than enough prosperous burghers to support an elegant building for vaudeville, concerts and dances. (In 1917, for instance, 1,200 people crammed into the hall for the first Yonkers Police Association reception, featuring bango-strumming, singing and dancing until the early hours of the morning.) But the factories started closing more than 50 years ago and the downtown has been deteriorating since.
In recent years, there has been a determined push to revive the downtown and its waterfront rim. There are plans to build a parking garage and 400 units of market-rate housing overlooking the Hudson. Metro-North is refurbishing the rundown riverside train station, and the Greyston Foundation, which began 20 years ago as a little bake shop run by Zen students, has broken ground for a $9 million bakery designed by Maya Lin.
Yonkers officials introduced the Greyston Foundation to St. John's Episcopal Church, which owned Philipsburgh Hall and wanted to restore it but lacked the expertise. Greyston -- which has built and is the manager of 215 units of low-income housing in Yonkers -- became the building's co-owner, sharing the cost and work of the restoration and the management of the building.
"This was a wreck," said Mr. Lief, as he opened extra-wide mahogany doors into the marble-walled lobby the other day. When he first saw it, more than a year ago, a ballroom wall was torn away, exposing exterior brick. The skylight glass was cracked and tarred. The floor buckled in waves high enough to please a skateboarder.
After digging through three layers of flooring, the original oak was uncovered. Many of the replacement boards had to be custom-made because the 1905 oak slats were slimmer than the ones available now. The elaborate ornaments decorating the walls and ceiling were replaced, using molds from the few whole examples that were left.
Now there are fanlights over the mahogany ballroom doors and intricately detailed pillers, cornices, garlands and vases all over. The wide railing is also mahogany, the polished floor shines and there is a carved and curlicued balcony and organ room above the polished semicircle stage.
The air-conditioning posed a problem. At the turn of the century, big blocks of ice were placed in the basement, and fans blew cool air from them into the ballroom through ducts. The new system uses a homemade system of fabric, cold-air ducts attached to fishing-pole reels that retract them in the winter. The task now is to bring in performances worthy of the newly restored ballroom. 
"The hope is to create a Yonkers version of the Brooklyn Academy of Music, revivals," said Mr. Lief. "We hope that's what's going to happen here."
On the shorter term, there will be swing and salsa dancing in the ballroom on summer evenings. On June 8, there will be a performance by the Movement Arts Collaborative of the Greek tragedy "The Eumenides," and on June 18, the Santa Rosa Youth Orchestra will play. And many more shows are being planned, said Matilda Hohensee, the center's executive director.

HEADLINE: Then, Now: New Rock City 

BYLINE:  By JON PARELES 

 BODY:
JOEY RAMONE, who died of lymphoma last year, might have been tickled to know he has simultaneous birthday parties tonight.
 One, where bands will compete to appear on the B-side of a Joey Ramone tribute single, is at CBGB, the Bowery dive that was founded in 1973 and soon nurtured the Ramones, punk-rock and a circle of disparate but influential New York rockers including Television, Patti Smith, Blondie and Talking Heads. 
 Meanwhile, the Joey Ramone Birthday Bash, a benefit for lymphoma research with Ronnie Spector and many others performing, takes place four blocks downtown at the Bowery Ballroom, a 1990's arrival that's just one of the places where a New York rock resurgence is gathering momentum. 
The Strokes (who are already too popular for clubs), the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, the Walkmen, Oneida, Ex Models, the Rapture and a dozen other bands are seizing and stretching the legacy of CBGB in its heyday: rock that's smart, skeletal and recklessly ambitious, eager to provide an antidote to synthetic pop and self-important mainstream rock. The first words on Radio 4's new album, "Gotham," are, "New electric sounds rattle underground." 
New York City has hardly been silent since the late 1970's, not with hip-hop, hardcore and any number of individual breakthroughs: Sonic Youth, Moby, Marc Anthony, Alicia Keys. Yet the current New York rock renaissance, with bands spanning the spectrum from arty to party music, strongly echoes and parallels an era that many of the new prime movers never saw. 
"I've been waiting for something to happen for most of my life," said Karen O, 23, the singer of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs. "What's cool now is that there are so many different avenues of music coming up. People are making music that they don't care if people like, and people are making music to rock out to. People are willing to experiment. We're all trying to build on something that was leveled."
Once again, individualistic music is being pounded out in clubs on the Lower East Side (and in its newer annex, Williamsburg in Brooklyn, where high rents have driven many musicians and artists). And once again, musicians are discovering the power of pithy minimalism coupled with repetition, muscle and noise, strategies long identified with New York City.
"It was only when we left New York that people kept saying it sounds like New York," said Julian Casablancas of the Strokes, whose lean, disillusioned songs virtually sum up guitar-driven New York rock from the Velvet Underground onward. "I wasn't going for a specific New York thing. I was just trying to make good music. For me it's a lot more about substance over style."
There was little evidence of a nascent style in 1973, when Hilly Kristal took over a Bowery club under a flophouse and named it Country Bluegrass Blues and Other Music for Uplifting Gourmandizers (CBGB and OMFUG). He started booking local rock bands with a crucial proviso: they could play only their own material. "They kept coming out of the woodwork," Mr. Kristal said. CBGB quickly filled a void left by the (literal) collapse of the Mercer Arts Center, where the New York Dolls had played, and the closing of Max's Kansas City, where glam-rock had held sway.
The bands that converged on CBGB (and later the reopened Max's) rejected the blandly professional pop, overblown guitar jams and elaborate progressive rock they were hearing on the radio. But instead of attempting some kind of revival, they reconfigured old rock virtues into music that had not been heard before. 
Self-consciousness was crucial to the bands at CBGB. Though the music often seemed simple, it was primitivist, not primitive. "We knew that what we were doing was revolutionary," said Tommy Erdelyi, better known as Tommy Ramone, the Ramones' first drummer. "We were connoisseurs of rock's history and where it should go. We wanted to bring back short songs, pop melodies, things like that. But I think we were the first group to consciously use the fact that we weren't virtuosos, to realize that this was an advantage. We stripped down a lot of things and just put in the gist of what was needed." 
At CBGB, that determination to purge inessentials led not just to the Ramones' definitive punk rock but to music as multifarious as Television's jazzy, elastic drones and jams, Patti Smith's incantatory poetry merged with garage rock, Talking Heads' clean-lined bubblegum funk, Blondie's radically deflected girl-group rock, DNA's atonal jolts, Richard Hell and the Voidoids' gnashing guitars, and the relentless, confrontational organ-and-drum-machine songs of Suicide. In the mid-1970's, none of it seemed headed for the Top 40 anytime soon. 
But New York was in a recession then, and the living was cheap, if not easy. David Byrne recently recalled that the three original Talking Heads shared a Chrystie Street loft for $300 a month. So there was far less commercial pressure on musicians. Bands like the Patti Smith Group and Blondie woodshedded at CBGB, playing four sets a night for weekend after weekend. And in 1975, Mr. Kristal seized media interest with a festival of what he called the top 40 unsigned bands in New York -- actually, about 70 of them. What had been downtown entertainment was suddenly seen as a movement, and it would go on to seed do-it-yourself rock worldwide.
Decades later, independent rock has a firmly established infrastructure: clubs, college radio stations and coverage from both ingroup fanzines and a mainstream determined to detect the latest thing immediately. Yet for a few years, New York's rock resurgence hid in plain earshot, amid a glut of grunge, hardcore, rap-rock and punk-pop. The new rock has also kept its distance from heavy metal, roots-rock and self-pitying collegiate rock. As it renounces bombast and decoration, it inevitably harks back to the first salvo of CBGB's rock. 
This time around, there is a hint of a revival, the same nostalgia that's driving other bands to rediscover early synthesizers and write so-called electroclash tunes. But unlike most electroclash bands, the rockers are twisting together their sources, not simply imitating them. And this time, while New York is the music's stronghold, there are already like-minded bands elsewhere, like the White Stripes and the Von Bondies in Detroit. 
"What's really refreshing to me about this scene, so to speak, is that it does have a sense of history," said Mike Stuto, the co-owner and booker of Brownies on the Lower East Side. "It does understand the 30 years of history that have led up to its being, as well as the 20 years before that." 
The music can be as sparse and vociferous as the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, with Ms. O sending out put-downs and come-ons with a sharp giggle over short, splintered lines for guitar and drums. It can be as frenetic as the scrabbling guitar patterns of the Ex Models, as haggard as the woozy moans of the Walkmen, as troubled as the wary anthems of Longwave. Or it can be as barbed as the dissonant rebel yelps of the Panthers, as choppy as the punk-funk variations of the Rapture or Radio 4, as cantankerous as the improvisations of Black Dice and as inexorable as the overloaded, pulsating ostinatos of Oneida. 
Alongside countless other hopefuls, these bands have played around unpaid or low-paying neighborhood clubs, downtown and in Brooklyn. Soon, midsize club bookers like Ryan Gentles (now the Strokes' manager) at the Mercury Lounge and Mr. Stuto at Brownies were presenting full nights of what Mr. Gentles dubbed "the new sound of New York," on posters for one quadruple bill.
But in the late 1990's the music business was seeking hits elsewhere. "The lack of major-label interest in underground rock enabled the music to be itself for a little while," Mr. Stuto said. "Because there isn't the attention, people do it from the heart. And because they're not trying to create hit records, they're trying to express themselves and make great music." 
Now the bands have been noticed, perhaps with increased urgency since Sept. 11 focused the world's attention on New York. With the Strokes on a major label and record-company scouts swarming around the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Longwave and others, Mr. Stuto said he expected carpetbaggers and opportunists to move in on the scene soon. (He is closing the music room at Brownies in August. "Why not go out on top?" he said. The closing could shift some of the new bands back to CBGB.)
"Right now," said Mr. Casablancas of the Strokes, "in the grand scheme of the music business, we're all relatively small. The music is slowly surfacing, but I don't know how successful we're all going to be in the future."
Yet with various gradations of New York irony, the new bands are already singing manifestos. "It's our time, sweet baby, to break on through," Karen O of the Yeah Yeah Yeahs sings as she sprinkles beer on her adoring club audiences. "It's our time to be hated."
Shahin Motia of the Ex Models cackles, "Rock 'n' roll can't be made no more," amid skewed, hurtling guitar chords that prove him completely wrong.
Rock was moribund in the mid-1970's, too, when Joey Ramone and his band decided to get back to basics. His best birthday present is to have New York kick-start the music one more time.

Furious Guitars and Harried Vocals
Here is a list of recordings by leading new New York City bands, in order of preference. Most are on independent labels that can be tracked down through mail order, the Internet or stores like Other Music (15 East Fourth Street, 212-477-8150), Rocks in Your Head (157 Prince Street, 212-475-6729), Kim's Mondo Music (6 St. Mark's Place, 212-598-9985) and Earwax (218 Bedford Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, 718-486-3771).

THE STROKES' "Is This It" (RCA). Guitars scrape old wounds raw or push toward the next encounter as love goes wrong again and again.

YEAH YEAH YEAHS: "Yeah Yeah Yeahs" (Wichita Recordings, P.O. Box 27754, London E5 OFP, England; www.wichita-recordings.com; will be rereleased in July by Touch and Go Records). Just drums, guitar and Karen O, hopscotching from rockabilly to P. J. Harvey, from flirtation to flippancy.

THE RAPTURE: "Out of the Races and Onto the Tracks" (Sub Pop, P.O. Box 20645, Seattle, Wash. 98102; www.subpop.com). Brittle, austere, sometimes furious guitar funk, with dire existential ruminations and feedback seeping into the empty spaces.

EX MODELS: "Other Mathematics" (Ace Fu, P.O. Box 3388, Hoboken, N.J. 07030; www.acefu.com). Speed, odd meters, dissonant interlocking guitars and harried vocals add up to songs that go haywire with utmost precision.

THE WALKMEN: "Everyone Who Pretended to Like Me Is Gone" (StarTime International, 285 Fifth Ave., PMB No. 452, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11215; www.startimeintl.com). Rock anthems with a dire hangover, groaning their excuses while the lo-fi band plays with brusque deliberation.

ONEIDA: "Anthem of the Moon" (Jagjaguwar, 1021 South Walnut, Bloomington, Ind. 47401; www.jagjaguwar.com). Minimalism gets the caffeine jitters, as repeating keyboard lines batter relentlessly against frantic guitars and drums.

MAHOGANY: "The Dream of a Modern Day" (Darla, 3460 Potter Lane, Sacramento, Calif. 95821; www.darla.com). Over the crisp geometry of drum-machine rhythms and rectilinear vocal melodies, a la Stereolab, guitars and cellos shimmer and splash, enriching the structures by blurring them.

"THIS IS NEXT YEAR: A BROOKLYN-BASED COMPILATION": (Arena Rock, 68 Greenpoint Ave., Brooklyn, N.Y. 11222; www.arenarockrecordingco.com). A 42-song, 42-band anthology.

THE PANTHERS: "Are You Down??" (Troubleman Unlimited, 16 Willow Street, Bayonne, N.J. 07002; www.troublemanunlimited.com). Wrangling, discordant guitars build pressure, and discordant vocals discharge it in insurrectionary slogans.

RADIO 4: "Gotham" (Gern Blandsten, P.O. Box 356, River Edge, N.J. 07661; gernbland@aol.com). Guitar-scrubbing, fuzz-toned funk that's determined to make agitprop danceable.

AARKTICA: ". . . Or You Could Just Go Through Your Whole Life and Be Happy Anyway" (Darla). Guitars, voices and electronic pulses are layered together in stately, gradually changing, mostly instrumental songs that could come from a less neurotic version of the Cure.

FRENCH KICKS: "One Time Bells" (StarTime International). Bouncing along on keyboards one moment, facing guitar barbs the next, the French Kicks' songs are as unstable as the romances they sketch.

AVEY TARE AND PANDA BEAR: "Spirit They're Gone Spirit They've Vanished" (Animal, 67 Atlantic Avenue No. 2, Brooklyn, N.Y. 11201; animal@myanimalhome
.com). Deep within a very private world, gentle songs are spattered with noise and clutter turns into phantasmagoria.

SECRET MACHINES: "September 000" (Ace Fu). Serenely unfolding instrumentals ease gradually into songs that end up someplace between Tortoise and Wilco.

LIARS: "They Threw Us All in a Trench and Stuck a Monument on Top" (Gern Blandsten). Furious, one-note rants top music that grinds and churns and squalls, an irritant and proud of it.

PALOMAR: "II" (Self-Starter Foundation, P.O. Box 1562, New York, N.Y. 10276; www.selfstarterfoundation.com). Three women and one man play wry, galloping pop that can switch to punk overdrive.

BRENDAN BENSON: "Lapalco" (StarTime International). A thoroughly unpunk songwriter splits his attention between getting the girl (not easy) and finding the perfect chiming guitar line (not hard).

ENON: "High Society" (Touch and Go, P.O. Box 25520, Chicago, Ill. 60625; release date June 4). Slyly mercurial pop that changes style with every track, putting new crimps into each minigenre.

LES SAVY FAV: "Go Forth" (Frenchkiss, 111 East 14th Street, PMB No. 229, New York, N.Y. 10003; www.lessavyfav.com). Upbeat, jaunty rock, deliberately curdled with dissonant guitar lines and critiques of captialism.

THE REALISTICS: "Real People Are Overrated" (Tiswas, 332 Bleecker Street, Suite G11, New York, N.Y. 10014; www.tiswasnyc.com) Anglophile new wave rock on the rebound, complete with vocal harmonies and analog oscillator swoops. JON PARELES

HEADLINE: DANCE; 
A Master Passes On Ashton's Mastery

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER DUNNING 

 BODY:
AMERICAN Ballet Theater will present the company premieres of "The Dream" on Friday and "La Fille Mal Gardee" on May 31 at the Metropolitan Opera House. Created for the Royal Ballet, the two classics are signature works by Sir Frederick Ashton, a choreographer who in many ways defined English ballet in the 20th century.
 "Fille" (1960) tells the story of two sunny, impudent peasant lovers. It is also Ashton's tribute to his beloved English countryside. 
 "The Dream" (1964) retells Shakespeare's "Midsummer Night's Dream." The central roles of Oberon and Titania were created for Anthony Dowell, then a green young dancer, and the ballerina Antoinette Sibley. The dance began one of ballet's greatest partnerships. The roles are being taught to the Ballet Theater dancers by Sir Anthony, the artistic director of the Royal from 1984 to 2001. 
He and Kevin McKenzie, artistic director of Ballet Theater and an Oberon with the Joffrey Ballet in 1974, recently talked about Ashton (who died in 1988) with Jennifer Dunning, a dance critic of The New York Times. They met at the Ballet Theater studios in Manhattan. Here are excerpts from their conversation.

JENNIFER DUNNING -- Why "La Fille Mal Gardee" and "The Dream"?

KEVIN McKENZIE -- I've had a long history with "The Dream." It had a huge impact on me, through a lot of my career. And a surprising development gave me my first exposure to Anthony. I got ill. Anthony had actually been off with an injury, but he came back and did "The Dream" for the Joffrey Ballet. So I had this double whammy of being exposed to the genius of that work and then suddenly being able to see it in 3-D for the first time as a youngish dancer, to see Anthony do it.

ANTHONY DOWELL -- I flew in quite at the last minute. Of course it was very exciting, but the jet lag hit almost in the middle of the pas de deux, which is unusually long and at the end of the ballet. It's bust-a-gut time for Oberon. I remember feeling, "I'm not here and I don't want to be here." I was almost on automatic pilot. I really felt my whole body mechanism had switched off. It was terrifying. And Misha Mikhail Baryshnikov had come, too! Word had gotten round.

McKENZIE -- That was the first connection I had had to a masterpiece being created on a role model of a dancer. So it was a natural thing when I came back as director to want to have "The Dream." Not only is it a great work, but if I could get that experience for these dancers, all would be well in the world.

DUNNING -- Why "Fille"?

McKENZIE -- Same thing. It's one of Ashton's great masterpieces. And long overdue for us to do.

DUNNING -- It has been said that love is an essential theme in Ashton's ballets. Is this true of "The Dream" and "La Fille"?

DOWELL -- I think that human relationships were a very important thread in all his works. He didn't ever show the seamier side of life. He wanted glamour and allure, which was one of his favorite words. I don't know if one can say he saw love entirely through rose-colored glasses, but it was without too much pain and brutality.

DUNNING -- But things get pretty passionate and conflicted for Titania and Oberon.

DOWELL -- Yes, but they're supernatural and powerful forces. The dancers must not fall into the trap of making Titania resemble the fairy at the top of the Christmas tree. Ashton saw her as a creature of both power and sexuality and he found these characteristics in Antoinette when she danced. He saw that she was a very sensual, very tactile performer. The original wig was very straight and wild and almost green, and she loved that. I want to impress on the dancers that they have to be sensual and powerful.
I think it would be very difficult to dance an Ashton ballet if you loathed your partner. There are very tender moments in his ballets.

DUNNING -- Was Ashton himself tender?

DOWELL -- Yes. And of course "Fille" was his great homage to his love of the countryside. I was lucky enough to visit him down at his country place in his last years. I was putting on my own production of "Swan Lake." I wanted to tell him personally that I wasn't going to use his fourth act, and I wanted him to create a new waltz in Act I.
He was very good. He said: "I quite understand, Anthony. You must do what you want and all that. But no, I won't do you another waltz. I've done a perfectly good one." I was not prepared for that. Anyway, this visit enabled me to see him in the surroundings that made him happy. He adored the country. So apart from romance, "Fille" is very much his homage to pastoral landscapes.

DUNNING -- How do you feel, Sir Anthony, about restaging Ashton ballets in such a different time? Are there still national styles of dancing?

DOWELL -- That's an old chestnut. I feel any dancer who gets to the top of their profession gets there because of their own individual style, whatever nationality they are. Yes, there are certain linear details that Ashton required. And so a dancer who is used to working in a certain style will have to get used to the differences and make changes.
You must preserve ballets. A ballet can't be frozen in time, or become a museum piece. It lives on through the dancers. You must respect the structure and choreography but at the same time allow the individual artists to find their own way. One day, horror of horrors, when the copyright expires on the Ashton, MacMillan and Cranko ballets along with many others, they could be up for grabs, rather like Petipa's work is today. So, for example, you might have another version of Ashton's "A Month in the Country" or "The Dream." Hopefully, I won't be around to witness this. But of course in Petipa's time there was no film, no video. Luckily now we have a record through these mediums of what was intended.
Life goes on. Dancers change. You try to protect what you know. But you mustn't make the guidelines too rigid. Otherwise they can't move freely.
When I first danced "The Dream," I think those early performances were just a sketch. I was still a young dancer. Over the years, you add layers and as you get older as a dancer you learn about economy. It's what you don't do that sometimes counts. I learned that from Fonteyn. It's the moments of stillness that are important. When a young dancer learns something, everything's busy and they think they have to put the whole kit and caboodle in. You pare that down and leave the essence, the strong focal points. So now when I teach a role, I can give the dancers a head start as they are learning the final and distilled version of the role that made Sir Frederick happy.

McKENZIE -- That's one of the reasons I was dying to get this here. That essence in the studio is something the dancers have a direct link to. And that in turn refers back to the day when we have "The Dream," "a version after Ashton." There's a link directly through Anthony to Ashton, because although Ashton created the work, Anthony colored it.

DUNNING -- How much did Ashton allow or expect his dancers to contribute to the choreography?

DOWELL -- Oh, that's what was so wonderful. He gave you so much freedom, you felt that you'd created 85 percent of it, so that the role fitted you like a glove. When I first started to work with Ashton, he didn't demonstrate much. He had ideas, or ideas from dreams. There's rather a strange move in the pas de deux in "The Dream" where she revolves under your arms. Ashton had had a dream about it. He left us in the studio to work it out. He said: "Try to make it work. I don't know how." Then he came back and we'd succeeded. He was always steeped in the music. That's why when you hear a piece of music that he had choreographed to, it's so perfect and you can't imagine any other steps working better.
"A Month in the Country," which was Ashton's last work, had a small cast and we'd all sit around chatting for at least 10 or 15 minutes. He'd put off starting. But he enjoyed that. He had such humanity. He was so fascinating to talk to. And that sort of broke the ice. No, once he got going, the creative process was very fast. I very rarely found there were bad days with him.

DUNNING -- Was Ashton unusually relaxed in his give-and-take with the dancers?

DOWELL -- In later life I worked with a young choreographer who shall be nameless, naturally, and Antoinette and I were in the studio, expecting to work in the same way as we did with Ashton. We would start showing things and ideas for movements to the music. "What about this?" we would ask. And the reply was always, "No, no. No, no." So we just stood there waiting to be told what to do.
Well, Ashton and MacMillan were so experienced, but they were terrified of the studio the first days of starting. Ashton was physically ill with nerves, but he always gave you the freedom of letting things happen naturally. Oh, it was wonderful, wonderful.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY; 
Priceline.com Adds Vacation Packages

BYLINE:  By BOB TEDESCHI 

 BODY:
Priceline.com has been something of a boon to travelers who are looking for bargain air fares, hotels and car rentals, provided they can live with some uncertainty, like not knowing what airline or hotel they'll be using. Now, the company is expanding into the realm of vacation packages, without some of the uncertainty. 
 Priceline last week introduced a vacation feature that allows travelers to select a hotel at a given destination and specify the dates of their trip and the price they'd like to pay for the package (which includes air fare). As with Priceline's airline ticket service, travelers are not given the airline name or travel times until the package is purchased, nor can they apply these purchases toward their hotel or airline affinity programs. 
 Available destinations, the company said, include places in the Caribbean, Mexico, Europe and Canada, as well as Chicago, St. Louis, New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Florida. 
Henry Harteveldt, an online travel analyst with Forrester Research, a business consulting company, said that in offering this service, Priceline would compete with some established sites, including Expedia. While Expedia does not ask consumers to suggest prices they are willing to pay, it does allow customers to choose travel dates and hotels at certain vacation destinations. Expedia then offers flight times, using a carrier that remains anonymous until the package is purchased. BOB TEDESCHI

CORRECTION-DATE: May 26, 2002

 CORRECTION:
A report in the Travel Advisory column last Sunday about Priceline.com vacation packages referred incorrectly to a similar service by Expedia.com. Expedia indeed tells customers the name of the airline before a vacation package is purchased.

HEADLINE: 'Free' Music at Jones Beach 

BYLINE:  By ALLAN RICHTER 

 BODY:
KEN WALDMANN is a financial analyst, so statistics come easily to him. For starters, Mr. Waldmann, 43, of North Bellmore, says he has attended more than 400 rock concerts. More than 100 were by the Grateful Dead, 40 by David Bromberg and 20 by Bruce Springsteen. Also figuring prominently in Mr. Waldmann's rock patronage are the 80 shows he has attended at the Jones Beach Theater.
 But of those 80, he has actually seen only 50. 
 For the rest, he has heard the music sitting outside the Jones Beach Theater, the way Chicagoans watch the Cubs from porches and rooftops just beyond Wrigley Field.
In Mr. Waldmann's case, hearing concerts this way is an arrangement that lets him happily straddle his youth and middle age. As his children grew over the years, Mr. Waldmann wasn't about to let fatherhood curb his concert attendance. Nor was he going to let concerts cramp his style as a parent, or force a break with the cardinal rule that comes with it: Never bore your kids.
For others who have adopted their own improvised bleachers in Wantagh, the impetus is economic.
"Ticket prices are out of control -- 50 or 60 bucks -- and going without a ticket is a good last-minute thing to do," said Peggy Gluszak, 39. "If it doesn't work out, you leave."
Last summer Ms. Gluszak, a Queens nurse, heard the band Yes as well as Tom Petty from the free seats, and she expects to return for many more shows.
Each summer, dozens of Long Island music lovers without concert tickets dot the beach at Zachs Bay's eastern end. Some sit at the parking lot area near the Jones Beach Theater entrance. Others anchor their boats just beyond the floating barrier behind the stage. Sometimes kayaks edge closer, darting near the shoreline. They soak up sounds that waft from the arena on warm breezes.
Wearing sweatshirts outside the Yes concert near last season's close, Maureen Gilligan, 35, and Karla Helgans, 35, sat on the beach, leaning against a lifeguard stand turned on its side. On a bed sheet spread before them were their vegetable wraps, wine and a Tupperware bowl of rice and vegetables.
Three summers ago, the two women discovered they could ride their bicycles to the arena in daylight and then go home on the bike path by following car taillights, as fans departed along the Wantagh Parkway.
It takes the skills of a meteorologist and an audiophile to pick the best listening location. Ms. Gluszak and a co-worker, Marga Giotta, 38, of Brooklyn, missed parts of the wind-muffled Yes concert, even from the spot between the arena's ticket booth and the main entrance, where many say the sound is usually best. On a humid night, listeners say, the sound couldn't be better there.
"When I came for Tom Petty you could hear it as if you were inside," Ms. Gluszak said, as Ms. Giotta nodded in agreement. "And if it isn't a theatrical stage show, just a guy standing with a guitar, do I really need to be up close? When I was younger, yes. Not anymore."
The wind wasn't enough to spoil the Yes concert for the two nurses. They reveled in the sliver of giant projection screen that they could see, as Jon Anderson, the lead singer, waved a larger-than-life arm overhead.
Rob Elznic, 44, a Queens bus dispatcher who lives in Hicksville, agreed that the spot where the nurses sat was prime real estate for a nonpaying fan. 
"There's a science to this," Mr. Elznic said. "The best sound is closer to the entrance, plus you're getting the best of both worlds. When you're listening to music on a warm night, the sound travels better and you're seeing the show on a screen."
But Mr. Waldmann, the financial analyst, said he would rather sacrifice sound quality to sit on the beach instead of near the parking lot. Similarly, he would rather sit on the sand outside than in one of the front rows in the venue, which would cut off any view of the beach and bay. 
"I could always sit sixth row at a concert and see the stage anywhere," he said. "Jones Beach is more than just a stage."
For Mr. Waldmann, last summer's Yes concert capped a busy season. He paid for Phil Lesh, who was the bass player for the Grateful Dead, and Crosby, Stills & Nash. But he heard the Allman Brothers, Rod Stewart, Ringo Starr, Jackson Browne and James Taylor from a beach chair, flipping through ESPN magazine and keeping an eye on his children, Rachel and Matthew, now 9 and 6, sipping Yoo-Hoos and apple juice and playing in the sand.
But Mr. Waldmann has an unwritten rule for such play: It should be relatively quiet, because the music is not nearly as crisp as inside. Loosely knit audiences have become such a fixture outside the Jones Beach Theater that Mr. Waldmann expects the etiquette within to apply outside as well.
"What bothers me is when there are rowdy groups and they don't realize there are people who are here to listen to the music," he said. "You don't play volleyball, and you don't bring a boombox."
Long Island concertgoers can spread out blankets at the Brookhaven Amphitheater, the Planting Fields Arboretum in Oyster Bay and Paul Simon's summer concerts at a Montauk horse ranch. But operators at those venues charge for the informal seating. And none of those shows equal the Jones Beach concerts for the diversity of artists who appeal to baby boomers, regulars at the Wantagh theater say.
Mr. Waldmann said: "From where I live, it's a bit of a trek to Brookhaven, and they don't have the artists I'm interested in. It's either artists from the 50's or the 90's." 
"It's a combination of money and timing," he added of the draw to Jones Beach. "I'll try to see a concert every three or four weeks inside at Jones Beach, and then I'll go outside the theater for the other shows there."

HEADLINE: A Setting Worthy of the Sculptures 

BYLINE:  By PHYLLIS BRAFF 

 BODY:
GLASS spears by Dale Chihuly sparkle in the sunlight, supersized flowerlike forms by Dennis Oppenheim impress with their wit, and a massive, undulating abstract bronze by Lynda Benglis produces a sense of energy that recalls the rolling surf. 
 These and dozens of other artworks are part of the outdoor sculpture program at the 16-acre LongHouse Reserve in a wooded area of East Hampton. The land, cleared for farming by early settlers, was then abandoned and allowed to become a second-growth forest in the 19th century. The reserve has added specimens, created gardens and shaped the terrain to provide strolling paths through pines, spruces, Japanese maples, California redwoods, magnolias and other flowering trees. This rich combination of textures is at its best with full summer foliage. 
 The reserve, now in its 10th year, is a nonprofit organization started by the textile designer Jack Lenor Larsen, who heads a board of trustees populated largely by specialists in horticulture, cultural affairs, creative design and art in every form. An art committee arranges the sculpture loans, which are usually for one or two years. A few pieces are long-term loans, and some are part of the LongHouse Reserve collection.
From Mr. Larsen's own collection came a sculpture by Grace Knowlton, a mixed-media work of five round forms of different sizes placed near the end of a broad lawn. As with everything at LongHouse Reserve, the positioning is obviously thoughtful. The work stimulates perceptual questions about scale and cerebral questions about the relationship between natural boulders and synthetic shapes. 
Mr. Larsen began construction in 1986 on the main multiuse building that gives the Reserve its name. A seventh-century Shinto shrine at Ise in Japan served as its architectural inspiration.
Most artworks at the reserve present themselves unexpectedly, as visitors walk the varied terrain.
In a few instances the art has a more formal setting, and the results can seem quite striking. Claus Bury's "Bridge," a large wood and steel abstraction originally done for the Brooklyn Bridge centennial, is effective at the end of a white pine allee. Toshiko Takaezu's stoneware piece "Closed Form" looks ritualistic at the end of what is known as the Red Garden.
Perhaps the greatest drama and sense of engagement comes from several strong abstract works that incorporate the spirit of nature and have a heightened impact in the outdoor setting. The churning wavelike piece by Ms. Benglis looks wonderful as the ambient light activates the hundreds of facets on its swelling white surface, making everything seem part of some momentary flux.
Takashi Soga's welded steel construction based on intersecting geometric forms borrows nature's rhythms, particularly breeze-driven gentle movements. The 31-foot central beam is intricately balanced to produce a continuous pattern of action that can seem both uncanny and reassuring.
A number of other pieces use nature's imagery, characteristics or materials in a very direct way. John McQueen's 10-foot-high "Shrouded Mantle" is made from interlaced lotus branches. Ricardo Regazzoni gives a streamlined industrial quality to a cluster of treelike stainless-steel columns, and Mr. Takaezu creates an imposing installation with seven bronze trunk-shaped forms titled "Tree Men in the Forest." Jim Owen's more informally placed coiled stoneware and fiberglass verticals, "Asperagi," emphasize their handmade surfaces and the way this quality blends with the outdoor locale. 
Yoko Ono's 16-foot configuration of a chess game encourages philosophical speculation about life, chance, nature and universal concepts with its title, "Play It by Trust." The contrast between the permanent forms of the chess pieces, made of white marble dust, and the variables of the surrounding trees and sky underscores the message.
"People read the label, and they always respond," said Matko Tomicic, the reserve's director. "They stop and think."
There is a broad social message in the largest piece on view, "Fly's Eye Dome," an adaptation of Buckminster Fuller's last geodesic dome, which offers a prototype for economical, ecologically sound and sturdy housing anywhere in the world.
Here, on one of the tree-ringed lawns, it generates responses that are largely aesthetic. Circular window openings create shadow patterns and frame both the sky and the lush green surroundings; satiny beige and white surfaces provide a sensuous glow, and metal fastenings register as pleasing, regularized high-tech schemes. 
It seems inevitable that one of this season's star loans, Magdalena Abakanowicz's "Mutant," will generate solemn interpretations. The weighty bronze, cast from a burlap-surfaced form, is the size of a bear. This featureless, imposing creature leans forward as if alert to threats and a need to test its environment. "Mutant" embodies courage, but its burlap markings imply vulnerability. It easily takes on a mythic role as a symbol for all organic beings. 
Serendipity is part of the range of experiences generated by the arrangement of art and gardens. Sunlight and prevailing atmospheric tones contribute to this feeling when Mr. Chihuly's cobalt blue glass reeds come into view. Depending on the day and hour, the translucent forms might have a purple or a red cast. They echo the tall grasses surrounding them, and their image is repeated as a reflection in the nearby pond.
A more traditional exhibition format is observed for the special summer show. On an open, grassy area near the main building, this year's presentation surveys 15 years of Tony Rosenthal's large works in aluminum and wood.

HEADLINE: In the Region/Westchester; 
Builders Are Moving to Fill Demand for Lab Space

BYLINE:  By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
IN response to a growing demand for biomedical laboratory space in Westchester County, a 30-year-old, 700,000-square-foot research park in Greenburgh and Mount Pleasant is planning to expand by as much at 570,000 square feet.
 LCOR Inc., an owner and the manager of the 280-acre Landmark at Eastview research and development park, which was built in the early 1960's for the Union Carbide Corporation, already has zoning approval from Greenburgh for a 320,000-square-foot expansion. It will begin building to suit tenants as early as this fall. LCOR, a national development, asset management and operations management company, is also planning to seek approval for 250,000 more square feet of office and laboratory space on a 100-acre section of the park that is in Mount Pleasant. 
 The decision to enlarge and upgrade the complex comes as the county is seeking bids to turn a vacant site it owns in Valhalla -- next to Westchester Medical Center and New York Medical College and less than a mile from the Landmark at Eastview -- into a privately financed biotechnology and medical research park. Under that plan, up to a million square feet of laboratory and incubator space for biotech companies would be built on 60 acres. 
Peter T. Gilpatric, senior vice president for LCOR, which is based in Berwyn, Pa., said the company might also submit a bid to develop the county's site. More than 30 private developers that have expressed interest in the project are being asked to submit their qualifications to the county. A final developer will be selected by late fall.
With about 8,000 employees, Westchester already has the state's largest concentration of biotech and pharmaceutical companies -- among them Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, which is at the Landmark at Eastview, and Acorda Therapeutics in Hawthorne.
But with many new biotech companies being spawned in New York City -- at academic institutions and hospitals like Columbia University and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, for example -- that are not able to afford or find space in the city, Westchester and other surrounding areas are stepping up efforts to accommodate them.
"At the current time, we don't have enough good incubator space for new and emerging companies who are taking their first step out of the research institution and attempting to become profit making," Mr. Gilpatric explained.
In its first expansion since buying the park in 1999 for $82 million, LCOR will build new lab and office space to suit tenants like Aton Pharma, a year-old company outgrowing its current quarters. The company, which is researching a new cancer-fighting drug, was founded in New York City by Dr. Paul A. Marks, president emeritus of Memorial Sloan-Kettering, and his associates at the hospital, and Ron Breslow, a chemistry professor at Columbia. Felix G. Rohatyn, the former ambassador to France, is chairman.
Aton started with 6,000 square feet at the Landmark and is now expanding to 15,000 square feet, said Nicholas Bacopoulos, its president and chief executive. 
Mr. Gilpatric said LCOR was offering what he called mezzanine space -- typically 5,000 to 30,000 square feet of office and lab space to new and emerging biotech companies like Aton Pharma -- as well as larger blocks of space to mature companies like Progenics Pharmaceuticals. It moved from Manhattan to the Landmark 13 years ago, when the park was owned by another developer. Progenics started out renting 3,000 square feet and now occupies 50,000 square feet -- and will soon need more. The company, which was started by Dr. Paul J. Maddon when he was a medical school student, is developing drugs used in the treatment of H.I.V. and cancer.
Robert McKinney, vice president of finance and operations at Progenics, said that the company wanted to remain close to scientific and medical institutions and to the talent pool they generate but that as a start-up, the company could not afford New York City rents.
For example, lab space at the Audubon Business and Technology Center, which is a part of the Audubon Biomedical Science and Technology Park across the street from Columbia-Presbyterian Center in Washington Heights, rents for about $40 a square foot a year, according to Mitch Gipson, executive director of the Aubudon complex. By comparison, rents for laboratory space at the Landmark are about $25 a square foot, not including taxes and utilities, Mr. Gilpatric said.
Many of the 1,200 people working for companies at the Landmark commute by car from Westchester and surrounding counties, although some take the Metro-North train from Grand Central Terminal to North White Plains, where a shuttle bus transports them to the Landmark.
As more biomedical companies like Progenics and Aton need additional space and new companies join them in Westchester, LCOR will add space at the Landmark in 50,000-square-foot increments contained in three-story, precast concrete modules, said Steven Rosenstein, the president of SRA in White Plains, a firm working with LCOR as a planning consultant. Those modules could be connected at a later date.
The main building at the Landmark is a three-story poured concrete and glass structure designed by Vincent Kling of Philadelphia for Union Carbide, which occupied it until 1985. Its aging heating, ventilation, air-conditioning and other delivery systems are being updated, Mr. Gilpatric said.
I N the new buildings, flexibility will be the key," Mr. Rosenstein said, adding that suite sizes would be able to accommodate companies needing as little as 1,000 square feet. In addition, delivery systems for heat, electricity, plumbing and air-conditioning will be designed to go where they are needed, he said. 
"We've learned our lessons from projects where we've guessed wrong," Mr. Rosenstein said. "Now we're planning for blocks of space that can be configured in a lot of different ways -- completely open or closed, for biotech or chemistry. We not going in with a specific tenant in mind. We're looking at a broader target.
"This is an emerging and dynamic industry, and what many landlords fail to do is transition with tenants."
The new construction at the Landmark need not be in competition with whatever is ultimately built at the county's site, Mr. Gilpatric said. For example, the county site could offer space to incubators and to established biomedical companies -- hospitals and research institutions -- that need core facilities like clean rooms and animal testing labs. By contrast, he said, LCOR -- which has $7.5 billion in developments completed, under construction or in predevelopment -- is focusing on small and midsized biomedical companies. 
"It's all unknown at this point," he said, "but whatever is built could be complementary rather than competitive. There's definitely a synergy created -- in terms of the labor force and infrastructure -- when an industry like this is clustered."
Several miles to the south of the Landmark, the Ardsley Park Science and Technology Center, the former headquarters for Ciba-Geigy, has more than 500,000 square feet of office and lab space. Its major biotech tenants include Purdue Pharma and Cultor Food Science, although it also leases space to the county and to the Westchester Library System.
Jason Halpern, the managing director for Halpern Real Estate Development, which owns and manages the center, said that like the Landmark, Ardsley Park was 95 percent occupied, although the owners had development rights to build 250,000 more square feet.
In another effort to develop more biotech space in the county, New York Presbyterian Hospital is seeking approvals from White Plains officials for a twin-building 384,000-square-foot complex. It would house a $100 million center for advanced proton therapy to treat 46 different forms of cancer, as well as labs intended for research into brain and neurodegenerative diseases affecting the elderly.
On June 28, the first Lower Hudson Valley Regional Biotechnology Conference will be held at the Dolce Tarrytown House conference center to explore the economic and development opportunities for biotech. The event is being organized by a group of public and private organizations, including New York Medical College, New York Presbyterian Hospital, the Westchester Medical Center and the Landmark at Eastview. 
"Are we all being overly optimistic?" asked Salvatore J. Carrera, the county's director of of economic development and real estate.
"No," he answered. "There's a tremendous amount of pent-up demand for more biotech and medical research space. This is not a dot-com phenomenon. We're talking about well-funded companies in an industry that is on the cutting edge for finding cures."

HEADLINE: The View From/Bridgeport; 
City of Bridges Weighs Repairing Two of Them

BYLINE:  By JEFF HOLTZ 

 BODY:
ACCORDING to city historians, bridges have been a source of controversy in Bridgeport since it became a borough in 1800, when it was named for its bridges over the Pequonnock River and its port on Long Island Sound.
 "A lot of mayors have run on bridges: whether to reopen them or fix them," said Mary K. Witkowski, the director of historical collections for the Bridgeport Public Library and author of the book "Bridgeport on the Sound" (Arcadia Publications, 2001). "And the Congress Street Bridge was one of the ones that really seemed to have the most trouble over the years. It was closed many times for repairs, especially during Jasper McLevy's time." 
 Now more than 40 years after Mayor McLevy's tenure, the Congress Street Bridge is the center of attention again. Along with the Pleasure Beach Bridge, it is one of two bridges in the eastern part of the city that have been closed for years and must now be replaced at a projected total cost of $50 million.
Part of the $30 million price tag for the Congress Street Bridge could be obtained through the state's Local Bridge Program. But because of budget problems, the city is not sure if it can find the remaining money.
"The city has to consider, three years down the line or later, when it comes time to pay for the bridge, whether we will have the funds available," said Joe P. Gresko, the municipal government's spokesman.
In the case of the Congress Street Bridge, many residents of the predominantly Hispanic East Side are feeling angered, alienated and frustrated. "Because of the closing of the bridge, the whole East Side of Bridgeport has gone down the drain," said Millie Maldonado, the president of Bridgeport's Spanish Merchants Association. "It has just deteriorated tremendously."
The drawbridge, which was built in 1919 and is on the Connecticut Historical Commission's list of bridges, connects the East Side of Bridgeport with downtown. The crossing, the fourth bridge at the site, has been left in the open position since 1997, when the state Department of Transportation determined that its substructures were moving.
Many residents and business owners said they believed that the inoperative bridge had increased response times for emergency vehicles. 
But Mr. Gresko said the East Side was served by a fire station and police station house. "We use the Stratford Avenue Bridge and the East Washington Bridge, which are just blocks away from Congress Street -- maybe adding about one minute worth of response time to a fire that would potentially be happening on the East Side that the main firehouse would be responding to," Mr. Gresko said.
Residents and merchants near Congress Street also said the economy of the East Side and downtown had suffered.
Victor Soukarieh, who has owned the Casa Grande Supermarket (about a half-mile east of the bridge) for the last three years, said business at the store had dropped by 60 percent. "I'm feeling like I'm on an island," he said. "This area has been dead."
Lawrence Fernandes, who, along with his brother, Sam, owns Larry and Sam's Seafood at the eastern base of the bridge, said he was close to laying off employees.
"As soon as they closed the bridge down, we lost about half of our clientele," he said. "We've been working hard to get it back through advertising, but the best advertising is the traffic."
Karen Lee Pulver, who lives in nearby Harborview Towers, is concerned because the elderly people in the building can no longer walk downtown.
"If the businesses start to leave because of the inconvenience, then this will become a ghost town," she said. "I feel like we're being cut off." But not everyone is convinced that replacing the Congress Street Bridge is the right option. Councilman John D. Guman, a Democrat and co-chairman of the budget committee, who, along with the rest of the City Council, is studying the problem, insists he needs more information.
"Do we spend $30 million to fix this bridge?" asked Mr. Guman, "Or can the $30 million be better spent somewhere else, and can there be a better solution?"
Mr. Guman said the same financial questions surround the Pleasure Beach Bridge, which joins the city's East End with Pleasure Beach. However, he feels that unless action is taken, Pleasure Beach could turn into a permanent wildlife sanctuary.
"Again, to fix the bridge, you're talking millions of dollars," he said. "But unless you fix the bridge, or come up with another solution, now you've got a prime piece of real estate that's going to the birds."
The Pleasure Beach Bridge, a wooden plank structure built in 1920 now in the Historic American Engineering Record, has been in the open position in the middle of the Lewis Gut channel since fire damaged its southern end in 1996.
City council member James Holloway, a Democrat from the East End, said Pleasure Beach is important to his constituents.
"Pleasure Beach is probably the only open-air space we have in the East End," he said. "It's used for picnics, outings, weddings, for the kids to go out there and fish. And right now the kids in the East End can't go."
The state has agreed to offer the city a grant of $5.8 million and a loan of $8.8 million through its Local Bridge Program for the Congress Street Bridge, but said that it does not see a benefit in replacing the Pleasure Beach Bridge because no one lives at Pleasure Beach.
Mr. Gresko said the city would be "considering pursuing the application" for the Local Bridge Program money, and he hopes that a courthouse for juveniles that the state is planning to build on the west side of the Congress Street Bridge might lead to additional state funds.
"The Congress Street Bridge is the priority of the city, because of the link that it creates with the downtown and the East Side," he said. 
"The Pleasure Beach Bridge is still important, but obviously it's linking the East End with vacant land. So, we're going to treat the bridge that has more impact on people first."
According to the city's official historian, Charles W. Brilvitch, keeping the Congress Street Bridge out of service means the city has reneged on a promise it made when it bought the bridge from the late P. T. Barnum and annexed the highly industrialized East Bridgeport for its tax base.
"We've gone against what the City of Bridgeport promised the residents of East Bridgeport in 1864: this bridge will be open and forever remain free and open to the public," Mr. Brilvitch said.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property; 
Downtown, a Menu of Incentives

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
TO help revive the downtown office market in the wake of the Sept. 11 attack, a complex set of federal, state and city incentives -- cash allowances and tax breaks -- are being offered to businesses that renew leases or move into the area. The incentives, together with rents that have gone down since the attack, have reduced the cost of office space to the point where it is 40 to 45 percent less than in Midtown, rather than the traditional 20 to 25 percent, according to real estate executives.
 Although few deals have been done in recent months, brokers say this price gap has begun to attract the attention of professional service firms, like lawyers and accountants, whose partners would pocket the savings. The question for these people, said Andrew M. Peretz, a managing director of Insignia/ESG, a real estate services company, is, Would you be willing to move downtown for $1 million? 
 Vacancy rates have continued to climb downtown and rents to soften as more space has come on the market than has been leased. More than 500,000 square feet of space was added to the downtown market in April, pushing the vacancy rate higher by six-tenths of a point, to 14.8 percent, according to a report by Insignia/ESG. Average asking rents declined 32 cents a square foot, to $39.15 a year. But some brokers caution that asking rents may not reflect the true state of the market because some landlords are offering concessions that reduce the effective rent.
The government-administered incentive programs, which are substantially financed with federal money, may influence the pattern of development throughout the city by attracting to lower Manhattan businesses that might otherwise consider locations in other boroughs. A case in point may be the 37-block sector of Long Island City in Queens that was rezoned last year to encourage development of high-rise office buildings.
According to Sanford H. Zuckerbrot, president of Sholom & Zuckerbrot, a commercial brokerage active in Long Island City, the downtown incentives are likely to nullify the objective of the Queens rezoning. "It will be hard to convince people to move to Long Island City if the price in lower Manhattan is the same," he said.
But the incentives will also have to overcome what many brokers describe as a psychological resistance to moving downtown, where the transportation system is still snarled and the proximity to horrific events is inescapable. "A lot of New Yorkers want to distance themselves from what happened there," said Ruth Colp-Haber of Wharton Property Advisors, a brokerage that represents tenants. "It is as if Manhattan has been divided into two cities, with 14th Street as the border."
Others say that dollars will ultimately trump fears, that the transportation will be rebuilt and improved and amenities developed. "There is $21 billion committed to downtown, so it is going to be a wonderful place to be five or seven years out," said Marc Shapses, a senior managing director for Julien J. Studley, a brokerage that specializes in representing tenants. "Once people figure that out, they will start to react."
It is this combination of factors, rather then the incentives alone, that will bring about the revival of downtown, said Mitchell Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University. "The incentives will combine with the infrastructure changes to make lower Manhattan the most attractive place to live, work and visit," he said. "It will be the only place in the city with a 21st-century transportation system."
Brokers report there has been little leasing activity downtown in recent months, despite the existence of large amounts of vacant sublet space left by companies that decided to move out of the area. Nevertheless, Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York, which promotes the southern tip of Manhattan, sees the glass as half full.
Even if there has been no rush by businesses to move there from other parts of the city or the suburbs, he said, neither has the outflow continued. "We are clearly seeing a stabilization of the downtown market," he said. "The ones that were going to leave have left. We don't see more companies leaving."
DESPITE the loss of about 13 million square feet of office and retail space in the attack and related events, he said, downtown remains the third largest central business district in the United States (after Midtown Manhattan and Chicago). As such, it is receiving "an unusual amount of attention from all levels of government," Mr. Weisbrod said.
The incentive programs are part of that attention. Although the impact of the incentives will vary with each company or professional firm based on size, activity and location, they could be substantial, according to calculations made by the alliance. 
A company with 10 employees that could take advantage of the incentives, for instance, might have a total rental cost downtown of $279,659 for a five-year lease. A similar company in Midtown would have a total rental cost of $612,500 over five years, according to the estimates of Mr. Weisbrod's group, well over double the cost downtown. 
Similar savings could be achieved by larger companies, the study found, although the mix of benefits might be different because companies with more than 200 employees are not automatically eligible for some incentives.
Since the incentives are intended to draw businesses downtown or persuade those already there to sign new leases, the benefits are concentrated at the early years of a lease and the savings decrease as time goes on. According to the alliance's calculation, a downtown tenant would save $48.48 a square foot compared with its Midtown counterpart in the first year of a lease because of incentives and lower rental rates downtown. That premium would diminish to $22.31 a square foot in the fifth year as the incentives would largely expire. 
One major program has nothing to do with rent, but is intended to compensate companies for revenues lost as a result of the attack and its aftermath. It is called the World Trade Center Business Recovery Grant Program and is administered by the state's Empire State Development Corporation. Applications for these grants must be filed by Dec. 31 of this year.
Businesses would have to show that they had losses in revenue not compensated by insurance or other government programs. They must have been in operation on Sept. 11 and must have continued in operation or plan to resume in New York City. They need to have had one to 200 employees at the downtown location and no more than 500 in the overall company.
The grants have a maximum amount in each of four zones, which are intended to reflect the degree of disruption based on proximity to the attack. The largest grants are available in the Restricted Zone immediately adjacent to the World Trade Center, where there is a maximum of $300,000. The Restricted Zone is bounded by Chambers Street on the north, Rector Street on the south, Broadway to the east and the Hudson River on the west.
Outside the Restricted Zone south of Canal Street and Rutgers Slip, the limit is $150,000. In the area north of Canal and south of Houston Street, river to river, the limit is $100,000. And in the area between Houston and 14th Streets the limit is $50,000.
Another plan to put cash in the hands of businesses that commit to move to downtown or to stay there is the Small Firm Attraction and Retention Program. Established by the city and state governments, it is aimed at companies employing 10 to 200 people who sign or renew leases for at least five years in the designated zones. A recent proposal, still not approved, would reduce the size threshold to businesses employing one person. 
Companies that have stayed in the Restricted Zone are eligible for $5,000 per employee, payable in two installments. Businesses that have stayed or moved into the area south of Canal Street and Rutgers Slip but outside the Restricted Zone are eligible for $3,500 per employee. 
In addition, the city's Economic Development Corporation has the discretion to make grants to companies with more then 200 employees that relocate to lower Manhattan or extend their leases.
Breaks in federal taxes for businesses that invest in lower Manhattan are contained in the New York Liberty Zone Tax Relief Act of 2001 passed by Congress as part of the Bush administration's economic stimulus plan. The Liberty Zone includes the area south of Canal Street and an additional segment in eastern lower Manhattan south of East Broadway and Grand Street.
The provisions are complicated, as federal tax matters tend to be, but one significant provision is greatly accelerated depreciation for leasehold improvements to buildings in the zone, said Jordan Silbert, an analyst with the Downtown Alliance.
"Companies in the area can write off the cost of those improvements over five years, rather than 39 years," he said. "We figure that for a company of 100 people, it could amount to a savings of $60,000 a year."
The law also includes a variety of deductions and tax credits, not all of which can be used at the same time, including a credit of $2,400 per employee per year for companies in the zone with fewer than 200 employees in the years 2002 and 2003.
Also included was a provision to defer taxation of insurance proceeds for destroyed or damaged buildings as long as the money is invested in lower Manhattan. The law also provides for up to $8 billion in bonds exempt from federal, state and city taxes to finance private investment, with $6 billion earmarked for lower Manhattan, Mr. Silbert said. 
THESE new programs come in addition to the existing Lower Manhattan Economic Revitalization Plan, which has been effect since 1995 to draw tenants downtown. This city program is intended to promote investment in buildings completed before 1975 by granting tax abatements.
The program, which is scheduled to expire in 2004, is open only to businesses operating below Chambers Street. Large companies, those with more than 125 employees, must sign a lease for at least 10 years and invest $35 per rentable square foot to be eligible.
In return, they get a 100 percent abatement of their real estate taxes, up to a cap of $2.50 a square foot, and a lesser break in the last two years of the program, which is in effect for five years. The landlord must pass the benefits through to tenants in the form of lower rents.
Smaller companies -- those with fewer than 125 employees -- need only sign a five-year lease and invest $5 per square foot to be eligible for the benefits, which also include reduction in the occupancy tax.
This program is available for office or retail tenants expanding or renewing leases downtown or coming to downtown from outside the city or from elsewhere in Manhattan below 96th Street. There is no limit on the number of employees a company can have.
Another existing program available to companies that relocate or begin operations in lower Manhattan is a 20 percent reduction in the cost of electrical power. Mr. Weisbrod noted that the power capacity needed to supply the World Trade Center towers is now available to other users in the area.
Although less attractive than outright grants and tax breaks, there are also low-interest loan programs for businesses and nonprofit organizations available through the Small Business Administration and other agencies in the city and downtown.
The cumulative effect of lower rents downtown compared with Midtown and the government programs "gets people thinking" about making the move despite the physical and psychological barriers, said Mr. Peretz of Insignia/ESG. "For a professional services firm, we are talking as much as $75,000 per partner per year," he said. Over a 15-year lease, that savings could be more than $1 million for each principal in a firm.
Most of the transportation problems in the area, including rebuilding PATH train tunnels from New Jersey and subway facilities destroyed in the attacks, should be resolved within 18 months, said Gerry C. Miovski, an associate director at Insignia/ESG. "And there are no problems east of Broadway," he added.
The complexity of the incentive program is something of a barrier itself, Mr. Shapses of the Studley firm reported. "A lot of these programs are as-of-right -- you just have to know about them," he said. "But I keep running into tenants who do not know about them."
With plans to rebuild 7 World Trade Center moving forward and a music festival set to run for much of the summer downtown, some brokers say the time to make deals is now, rather than later when lower Manhattan seems more inviting.
"Historically, large gaps between downtown and Midtown have led to deals downtown," said Michael Gottlieb, a senior managing director of Grubb & Ellis, a real estate services company. "In the current market climate with lowered rents and the recent incentives, there is a window of opportunity to make good economic deals."
He said the last time incentives were offered to promote development downtown -- in the mid-1990's during an economic downturn -- the initial response was slow, just as it has been recently. But, he said, a few notable examples could alter the mood of the market. "All you need is a few big deals, and a lot of people will follow," Mr. Gottlieb said.
BECAUSE more than half of the space on the market downtown is being offered for sublease, the landlords are still collecting rent from the primary tenants and are under little pressure to accept tenants will less than solid credit, brokers said. Even where dot-com companies vanished, they left behind multiyear letters of credit to cover the rent, they add.
Mr. Peretz said the current vacancy rate of about 14 percent downtown is modest compared with the rate of 25 percent in the mid-1990's. And, he said, the type of space available is different from that of the previous downturn.
Much of the space available today is in the most modern, best appointed buildings in the area. "Never has there been as much quality space on the market downtown," he said. "Most of the space in the mid-1990's was in secondary prewar buildings."
He said a lot of prospective tenants are tromping through buildings downtown, which could lead to deals later in the year. "There is a lot of prelease planning going on right now that could lead to leases in the third and fourth quarters," he said.
Even if that does not happen, the incentives put financial limits to procrastination. "To get the incentives, tenants have to make a commitment before the end of 2004," Mr. Peretz said.

Did Somebody Say Recovery? (Shhh.)

BYLINE:  By Leslie Eaton; This column about the local economy appears every other week. E-mail address: homefront@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IS it just a case of spring fever -- or is economic recovery in the air?
 Economists are holding their breath (and not just because it's still allergy season). Because newly released data contain the first faint hope that, not only is the economy in New York City not getting worse, it may actually be getting better. 
 And getting better in the way that matters most to most New Yorkers: jobs. 
In April, for the first time since September, the number of jobs in the city rose, according to an analysis by the New York City comptroller's office. And the number rose by a respectable 7,000 or so, according to the comptroller's economists, who try to adjust state data to take into account the usual seasonal fluctuations in jobs (there's usually more construction work in May than in December, for example).
There were gains in some interesting and important sectors since March, like business services, a category that includes temporary help agencies, which are usually the first to feel any recession and the first to feel a recovery. Some garment workers went back to work, after a truly terrible stretch of joblessness.
Hotels, stores and restaurants added employees in April, as did businesses related to air travel. And while New York City has not returned to the Orlando Without Ears status it achieved in 2000, "Tourism-related industries have likely seen a turnaround," according to Barbara Byrne Denham, chief economist of The New York Stat, a newsletter on the local economy.
So why, aside from their natural sobriety, are economy-watchers not dancing in the streets? Well, one month does not a recovery make. Especially since economic data usually gets revised, and gains have been known to melt into losses.
"To say we're in recovery, we need a couple more months," said Rae Rosen, a senior economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. Still, she exclaimed about the April jobs figures, "Aren't they good?"
There are some aspects of the April economic data that even ebullient economists question. For example, the comptroller's office reports that, after adjusting for seasonal factors, employment on Wall Street picked up last month. But lots of people think there's no reason to adjust Wall Street jobs for seasonal factors (after all, stockbrokers seldom work outdoors). Without that adjustment, Wall Street shows a slight decline. 
And firms have announced layoffs that have not yet shown up in the statistics, "so we know the count is going lower," said James P. Brown, who analyzes New York City employment for the New York State Department of Labor.
If economists are only cautiously optimistic, that may be because some of the other economic indicators have been rather rotten recently.
For example, the unemployment rate, which was also released last week, continued to climb in April, hitting 7.7 percent in New York City, far above the national average of 6 percent. The unemployment rate in the city has risen by 2.4 percentage points since March 2001, and is now the highest it has been since November 1998.
The unemployment rate is a rearview-mirror kind of indicator; it tends to rise even after a recovery begins. More ominous, perhaps, is the fact that in the first quarter of this year, estimated income-tax payments plunged by almost 40 percent, according to the city comptroller's office. Which probably means the well-off folks who pay these taxes every quarter are expecting to rake in a lot less money this year than they did last year, from their jobs or the stock market or both.
On the other hand, taxpayers may have realized that they paid too much in estimated taxes in 2001, and are unenthusiastic about getting a gigantic refund again next year, said Marcia Van Wagner, chief economist of the Citizens Budget Commission.
The tax drop is not good news for the city government, which must somehow come up with the cash to keep children in schools and garbage off the streets. No one is looking forward to a return to the fiscal problems of the early 1990's.
But whatever happens fiscally, economically the city does not seem to be slipping back into those bad old days, Ms. Van Wagner said, and the April jobs data prove it. "If you go back to '91 or '92, when things were really bad, every month it felt like we were hemorrhaging jobs," she said. "This time it doesn't feel like that."
And that feeling is nothing to sneeze at.

HEADLINE: Why Sr. Wants to Go to the Jr. Prom 

BYLINE:  By JILL BROOKE 

 BODY:
IF the minimum price of a ticket to a big benefit is typically $500 or $1,000, there is an alternative for those wishing to take the philanthropic swim but who are not yet titans of industry: the junior circuit. 
 Originally created to nurture younger people in the hope that they would mature into generous donors, the junior parties, with tickets from $150 to $350, have flourished for a decade. They raise money for worthy causes, but they are much more: mixers for the offspring of prominent families, a chance to be photographed in the latest fashions for the party pages, a nightly swirl of old and new friends from the right schools and summer resorts. 
 This explains why many juniors have shown reluctance to graduate to senior status, even as they pass 35, 40 and 50. Recently, the eternal youth of some junior-party regulars has become a concern to charities. At the recent dinner-dance for the Young Friends of Save Venice, a costume ball with $350 tickets, the organizers decided to prune from the invitation list those known to have outlived junior status. The charity, which raises money for historic preservation, holds a separate senior event in the fall with tickets at $1,000. 
One who was removed was Marc Biron, who helped start the Save Venice junior group 12 years ago and is now 45. "We politely explained that you can't be 45 and still be buying junior tickets," said Tia F. Chapman, executive director of the charity. "People have to realize when it's time to graduate and become a senior member of an organization that requires senior ticket prices."
Mr. Biron finds the forced maturation an economic and social disappointment. "It doesn't seem fair that suddenly you have to go to a new group who's 60 just because you're now over 40," he said. 
Nan Kempner, a veteran of the social circuit, recalled similar feelings when it was her turn to join the senior scene. "It's a lot cheaper and a lot more fun if you don't have to go to senior events, because you can go to more parties," Ms. Kempner said. "But you can't turn the clock back for too long."
Many partygoers, however, are both turning that clock back and holding it, and that is creating a problem for charities.
David Patrick Columbia, who chronicles the activities of the social set on his Web site, nysocialdiary.com, said: "We live in a culture where no one wants to grow up and be perceived as older. When I was kid, people over 30 were no longer junior. Then it was moved to 35, and then 39 a few years ago. Now people don't want to think of themselves as not young just because they are 40 or 50." 
Some see it as symptomatic of a generation that puts parties and status above responsibility and maturity. "It's the charities that ultimately suffer when they can't raise as much money," said one prominent socialite, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "You're supposed to be involved because you're civic-minded, not because you are trying to get pictures of yourself in Vogue or Harper's Bazaar."
Yet some of those who have benefited from their ability to maintain their junior status are among New York's most generous givers. Dayssi Olarte de Kanavos, 38, who helps organize benefits for Save Venice, Memorial Sloan-Kettering and the Alliance Francaise, said it was the sheer volume of invitations that drove many to purchase junior tickets. "When you're a junior, you pay $350 a ticket versus $1,000 for a senior," she said. "If you're on many committees, you're asking friends to contribute to many charities. In turn, you must support theirs. It can be very expensive."
For some charity boards, junior status has become ticklish. H. Hartley du Pont, the chairwoman of the YWCA's coming spring gala, said directors debated junior status earlier this month. "The age issue is a difficult, blurred area, and we are grappling with it," she said. After debate, the board decided to set one uniform price, $175, for the gala, on June 19. "We decided we didn't want to discriminate by age," Mrs. du Pont said. "We're all young at heart and young in spirit."
Other boards are considering graduated ticket prices, or creating a third tier for aging juniors or even doing away with the junior ticket all together.
"Junior events don't make much money for the charities, but they do have collateral benefits," said Jacqueline Weld, social columnist for Avenue magazine. "It creates a buzz because the press likes to cover beautiful women, which can also spark interest from sponsors." And, of course, said Ms. Weld, "out of 700 people at the party, maybe two or three are keepers who will become a charity's trustee."

Genetic Tests Abound. Why Won't Insurers Pay?

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE ANDREWS; Michelle Andrews is a freelance writer in Manhattan specializing in health care. Her column on its economics appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: moneymeds@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
LAST month, J. Craig Venter, the former president and founder of Celera Genomics, caused a stir in scientific circles by revealing that he had used his own DNA in the company's successful effort to unravel the human genome. The DNA was supposed to have come exclusively from anonymous donors. But protocol aside, it is easy to understand why Mr. Venter might have made himself a guinea pig: Your genetic code offers important clues to your future health and well-being.
 Researchers have already identified genetic links to thousands of diseases like breast and colon cancer, Alzheimer's disease, diabetes and heart disease. They have more than 900 tests available, including multiple tests for some diseases. 
 But just because there is a genetic test for a disease does not mean that health insurance will pay for it.
Until recently, many genetic tests have been for diseases like Huntington's or cystic fibrosis that involve a mutation in a single gene -- if you inherit that mutation, you are certain to get the disease. These tests are often performed prenatally or on newborns, and insurance coverage is routine if there is a direct risk of inheriting the mutation. With the help of the recently mapped human genome, many of the newer tests are for complex diseases like Alzheimer's, which may be caused by mutations in more than one gene or affected by environmental factors, and often might not appear until middle or old age. If you inherit a mutation, it does not guarantee that you will get the disease, only that you are susceptible to it. 
How much risk you face depends on factors like family history, sex and age. That makes insurers uncomfortable, particularly if no treatment is currently available. "If they're not sure of the test's outcome, and they don't know what to do with the results, insurers probably won't cover the test," said Susan Levine, vice president of Hayes Inc., a consulting firm in Lansdale, Pa., that helps insurers evaluate new technologies. 
Although test results may not be definitive, many people still want to know their genetic risk. Studies from the National Human Genome Research Institute have shown that 78 percent of women at high risk for breast cancer because of family history wanted genetic testing. Women who test positive for one of the breast cancer mutations can take aggressive preventive measures to reduce their risk, including stepped-up screening, drug therapy or surgery.
But for many people, preventing disease is not the only consideration. In preliminary data, one continuing study of 175 adults who have a parent with Alzheimer's, 23 percent of the participants agreed to be tested for the disease, even though there was no cure. "People have their own reasons for wanting to get a better handle on their risk, reasons that might not make sense to me as a doctor or to an insurer," said Dr. Robert C. Green, associate professor of neurology at the Boston University School of Medicine and director of the study. 
Asked why they agreed to be tested, 87 percent said they needed to arrange their personal affairs, 82 percent wanted to arrange for long-term care and 78 percent wanted to do things sooner than they had planned.
Breast cancer is one of the most common diseases to develop in adults and for which genetic susceptibility testing is widely covered by insurance. Myriad Genetics, a company in Salt Lake City that develops genetic tests, says 97 percent of insurance claims for the breast cancer test, which generally costs around $2,800 and has been available since 1997, are reimbursed. It estimates that about 60 percent of the claims for the colon cancer test, costing about $2,000, are also reimbursed. 
But the reimbursement numbers do not tell the whole story. Coverage decisions can be confusing and even contradictory. Counselors from the Patient Advocate Foundation in Newport News, Va., a nonprofit organization that assists patients, said they were contacted recently by a man whose father, uncle, grandfather and brothers had all been diagnosed with colon cancer before the age of 50. But, the man said, he was denied coverage for a colonoscopy to screen for the disease. The test was not considered medically necessary, the counselors said, because he did not have any symptoms of the disease. In another case, a health plan made the same decision for the opposite reason: It refused to pay for a mother's genetic test for colon cancer because she already had the disease. (She wanted to be tested to identify the specific gene mutation so that her children could also be tested for it.) 
"Unfortunately, coverage is very plan-specific at this point," said Karen Brown, director for cancer genetic testing at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, who counseled the woman's family.
Dr. Allan Korn, the chief medical officer for the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, says coverage is often decided case by case. "If someone is concerned about her family history, and the doctor feels there are risk factors involved, the test should be covered," he said. "The trickier question is around mass screenings -- if someone just comes in and says, 'I want to know.' There are often exclusions from coverage."
CLINICAL genetic testing for Alzheimer's is currently recommended only for people with symptoms of the disease. But that did not deter Janet Walsh, 46, of Port Washington, N.Y., who watched her father, Sidney Resnick, die of Alzheimer's at the age of 58 in 1981. When she had a chance to be tested through a research study six years ago, she took it. The news was bad: Ms. Walsh has two copies of the apoE4 variant of a gene that is associated with Alzheimer's, increasing her risk 15-fold. But Ms. Walsh used that information to take action. She and her husband, Stephen, arranged for three longtime associates -- a doctor, a nurse and a nursing home administrator -- to collectively make decisions with her husband about Ms. Walsh's care if that becomes necessary.
"Getting tested gave me control and helped me plan for the future," said Ms. Walsh, who has two children and a stepson.
As for Mr. Venter, he said an analysis of his genes showed that he had inherited from one parent the apoE4 gene, which is associated with abnormal fat metabolism and the risk of Alzheimer's. He is now taking fat-lowering drugs to counteract its effects.

HEADLINE: PERSONAL BUSINESS; 
Entrepreneurship Is Fun. Then There's the Day Job.

BYLINE:  By MAGGIE JACKSON 

 BODY:
DURING work breaks at KHWB, a television station in Houston, most of Annette Rainesalo's colleagues would relax with a cup of coffee or a cigarette. She would head to her car and call prospective clients for her fledgling voice-over business.
 "It felt like a double life," she said. "It felt like my mistress was my new business." 
 After months of juggling two jobs, Ms. Rainesalo, 36, quit her position as an executive assistant at the station last year. She now devotes herself full time to her company, Get Me That Voice, which she runs out of her home in Stafford, Tex. The company provides vocal talent for television and radio commercials, multimedia projects and sales presentations. 
Starting a business has always been part of the American dream, but more entrepreneurs like Ms. Rainesalo are hedging their bets these days, preferring to keep their day jobs as they gain both confidence and business. Many are waiting for the economy to fully recover.
The safety net of a day job is important during the risky start-up period, ordinarily about a year, yet the resulting balancing act poses challenges. How do you handle two workloads, plus family responsibilities? Should you tell your boss or colleagues? When do you quit the day job?
"People think of entrepreneurs -- certainly this was true during the Internet boom -- as a whiz kid who comes up with a business plan, visits a venture capitalist and goes for broke," said Patrick Von Bargen, executive director of the National Commission on Entrepreneurship, a public policy group in Washington. 
"Instead, the typical entrepreneur is someone who has an idea, maintains his day job and brings his idea through various phases," Mr. Von Bargen said. "The line of when you have to decide to leave your job and actually do this -- it's very gray."
A growing number of people are poised to take that chance. Last year, roughly 8 percent of working-age Americans, or 13.5 million people, started businesses, according to the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, an index of entrepreneurial activity in 40 countries that is compiled by Babson College in Wellesley, Mass., and the London School of Business. In 1993, about 4.5 percent of working-age Americans started businesses, according to Paul D. Reynolds, a professor of entrepreneurship at the two institutions and coordinator of the project, which last year surveyed 3,000 Americans ages 20 to 64.
During the start-up stage, about 65 percent of entrepreneurs have full- or part-time jobs, Mr. Reynolds said. 
"Most people starting businesses do everything they can to avoid risk," he said.
The challenges, however, hardly end there. Some 90 percent of businesses survive their first year in operation; only half are still around after five years, according to Mr. Reynolds.
MS. RAINESALO knows that the odds may be against her, but she started the business because she wanted to earn more money, to be her own boss and to have a job that she was passionate about. "You've got to feel good about what you do," she said. "Otherwise, why get up in the morning?"
She was willing to do plenty of footwork to help her business succeed. For nine months, and while still working full time at the television station, she rose at 4 a.m. almost every day to conduct Internet research and leave voice mail messages for clients.
In his studies of people with sideline enterprises, Thomas A. Bryant, associate professor of entrepreneurship at Rutgers University, found dozens of reasons why people work at two careers. They may be worried about the security of their current jobs or may just want extra income or the chance to work alone. But one motivation stands out: "It's some sort of personal outlet or personal expression," he said.
That may explain why many people start businesses in lines of work far afield from their earlier jobs. Only 9 percent of entrepreneurs had a day job in the same field as their new business, according to 1998 data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the most recent numbers available.
At a time when many laid-off workers are landing in new jobs they may not like, more entrepreneurs are starting businesses to recover their sense of fulfillment at work, said Jim King, director of the New York State Small Business Development Center in Albany.
"They're looking more and more at starting their own business as a means of getting back to something that is more satisfying and rewarding," he said.
Once someone decides to start a business, the juggling act begins. At home, the entrepreneur's family may have to cope with long absences and financial stress. "If you ask entrepreneurs what they risk most in those early years of the business, most of them say it's their family life," Mr. Von Bargen said.
At the day job, the balance can also be difficult, as entrepreneurs try to deliver a new product or service in the time squeezed in at night or on weekends. But even if they work on their new ventures strictly after hours, the appearance of divided loyalty or possible conflict of interest may anger some bosses.
Two Syracuse women were dismissed from their jobs last fall, they said, after they were interviewed in a local paper about their completion of a nine-week course on starting a business. 
"We were going there for information, to see what it took, what was needed," said Nancy Furbeck Hernandez, 44, who took the course last fall with a friend, Marcella Burnell, 47. As part of the course, offered by Appleseed Trust, a nonprofit community group that assists small businesses, they wrote a business plan to start their own medical billing company. Both women said they had told colleagues at work about the course.
Ms. Hernandez, who was a supervisor at Statewide Independent PPO Inc., a company in East Syracuse that reviews union medical claims, said the company's chief executive and president, Judith A. Conroy, told her that taking the course had constituted a conflict of interest. Ms. Burnell said she received a similar explanation for her dismissal from CNY Medical Group Management, where she handled insurance bills for a doctor's group. Ms. Conroy and Jolene Fitch, Ms. Burnell's boss, did not return several phone calls seeking comment.
Peter Zawko, program manager of Appleseed Trust, said, "Their business didn't directly compete with their previous employers, but it was perceived as being direct." 
Since then, Appleseed Trust has added a new component to its course on business start-ups: a discussion of when, or if, to tell your boss about your plans, Mr. Zawko said.
Tessil J. Collins, 49, a teacher at Madison Park Technical Vocational High School in Boston, says he had always been open with his bosses about the sideline television and radio production businesses he has run during his 18-year teaching career. In fact, he said, his two careers have complemented each other. His outside contacts have helped his video production students get jobs, and the schedule and pay package of teaching have helped support his current venture, the Spectrum Broadcasting Corporation.
"It's sort of like a good marriage," said Chuck McAfee, headmaster at Madison Park. "You're working during the day with young people showing them the craft and how to get there, and at night you're back at your craft."
The situation is so comfortable that Mr. Collins has found it difficult to quit his day job. "The biggest decision for me is making the decision," said Mr. Collins, who plans to leave teaching in the next year.
For many people, however, giving up the financial lifeline of a day job is frightening. As a result, they never take the plunge into full-time entrepreneurship.
"It's a big dream to quit the job and walk out the door, but most people don't get to that stage," said Margaret Somer, director of the Small Business Development Center at the University of Massachusetts at Boston. 
In some cases, they decide that the new ventures will never match their day jobs in salary and benefits, and that no other source of funds -- a spouse's pay or a second mortgage, for example -- is available until the venture pays off. 
LINDA HICKS, 55, a social worker in Wichita, Kan., had to rely on her own resources to start her business. She had long enjoyed making pottery, and about 10 years ago she started selling some of her creations at craft shows and fairs. But it was not until her employer, Lutheran Social Services of Kansas and Oklahoma Inc., began a round of layoffs in 2000, that she began to act seriously on her dream to make her pottery a full-time business. She lost her job in May 2001, but by then had started 11 product lines and begun developing a business plan for her company, Cat's Paw Pottery. Since her unemployment benefits ran out in November, she has been living off her savings, but she is confident that her business will soon become profitable. 
"I could get a full-time job," said Ms. Hicks, who is single. "But then you have to be creative at 10 o'clock at night."
Ms. Rainesalo was more fortunate. She had only a handful of new clients when she decided to quit her television job, but her husband, David Rainesalo, a news director at a local radio station, backed her decision, and his earnings supported them in the early days of her business. It was a financial squeeze, but she knew she would have to work on her client roster full time if she wanted her voice-over business to succeed.
"If I ever planned to be serious, I'd have to quit and give this a try," she said. "At this point, I have over 100 clients. I'm voicing just about every day in the week. I found something I love."

HEADLINE: Can This Tavern Get Its Groove Back? 

BYLINE:  By CHRIS BURRELL 

DATELINE: VINEYARD HAVEN, Mass. 

 BODY:
OPENING a restaurant in the dead of winter on Martha's Vineyard sounds foolhardy. But in the beginning, the restaurant, Black Dog Tavern, had modest goals. It wanted to give islanders a warm place to come into from the cold. It didn't imagine selling tourists clam chowder by the gallon and bagfuls of T-shirts and baseball caps.
 It was 1971, high tide for the counterculture. And the Black Dog's corporate philosophy, according to a former manager, Joe Hall, in a 1992 article in The Vineyard Gazette, was "to goof off, have fun, make some money, knock on wood, and serve the community." 
 The restaurant became a clubby island hangout, and the membership card was the Black Dog T-shirt, with the silhouette of a Labrador on the front and the year on the back. "Wearing one meant you were a groovy wharf kid who hung around with James Taylor and Carly Simon at the No-Nukes concert," said Paul Schneider, a writer who lives in West Tisbury. "At one point we were all in agreement that it was the coolest thing on the coolest island."
Eventually, tourists were lining up at the Black Dog bakery, next to the restaurant, for the T-shirts and sweatshirts. And when they wore them jogging in Central Park or along Rock Creek in Washington, they, too, emanated a bit of that wharf-kid cachet from one of New England's most favored resorts.
There followed mail-order catalogs sent to more than 200,000 customers, a cookbook and more outlets across the island selling anything you could print a black dog on, from dinner plates to doormats. Even Bill Clinton made a stop for souvenirs during a summer vacation (apparently passing some of it along to Monica Lewinsky). The little waterfront restaurant that sat just 50 people had gone global.
The growth and success seemed boundless -- until now. The Black Dog, which for years was the Vineyard's largest for-profit employer, has hit on hard economic times and seen a shake-up of its longtime top management. For the first three months of this year, the tavern was closed, one of the new management's cost-cutting measures. 
"There's no hiding it that the Black Dog has experienced some financial difficulty," said Robert Douglas Jr., the new general manager, whose father started the restaurant. 
Sales are lagging, down $2 million in 2001, or 20 percent, Mr. Douglas acknowledged. The year-round payroll has been cut to 64 -- a long slide from recent years, when the Black Dog carried more than twice that number of employees through the off-season. 
"There aren't many business owners who would allow their operation to run 'in the red' every winter season," wrote Elaine Sullivan in "The Black Dog Summer on the Vineyard Cookbook" (Little, Brown, 2000), of which she is a co-author. "The Douglases do, to keep the staff employed and the tavern open for conversation and fish chowder."
After its cutbacks this winter and the transfer of the Black Dog's advertising and T-shirt printing contracts to off-island companies, after decades of doing business on the Vineyard, many locals have been grumbling that the restaurant has lost its soul.
And Mr. Hall, the former manager, who worked at the restaurant for 22 years, quit in March 2001 and later filed a lawsuit charging the Douglas family with improperly siphoning off hundreds of thousands of dollars from the enterprise. The Douglases countersued last month, claiming Mr. Hall bilked the company, paid himself unauthorized bonuses and "brought the Black Dog to the brink of financial ruin."
Mr. Douglas, who joined his father's business in October 2000, fresh from flying cargo planes in Florida, said that almost all the economic setbacks at the Black Dog had been caused by the recession. The staff turmoil, he said, is a result of an approach that puts business interests first.
"Day 1, I gave everyone the chance to come on board and change to my philosophy of how the company is going to be managed," he said. "It's business. We don't have the operation that we had two years ago. Unfortunately, these decisions have consequences. Some people found other jobs."
Mr. Douglas smarts under criticism that the Black Dog has lost some of its community-mindedness. His family's commitment to the Vineyard, he argued, can be seen in the schooners in the harbor, owned by his family, which are often used for children's sailing programs.
Reviewing first-quarter revenues, Mr. Douglas said last week that the company is beginning to right itself. "We're tending toward profitability, and in the long run, we're going to do a better job for the community," he said. "We'll be a thousand times better than the original Black Dog."
Maybe so. 
But some islanders have grown weary of the mania. "You'd turn on the TV and see some actor wearing a Black Dog hat -- it was overexposure and saturation," said John Johnson, a carpenter who has lived in the Vineyard for 15 years. "They got so popular that very quickly no one from here would wear one. Seeing one was like how to pick who was not from here."
Bob Lee, a house painter from West Tisbury, agreed. "The Black Dog is an icon, but even icons only have their moment in the sun," he said.
But while many have put away their Labrador T-shirts, some still have affection for the easy-going spirit that Black Dog long embodied. "There's a love-hate relationship with the Black Dog," said John Best, a real estate broker in Vineyard Haven. "People have resigned themselves to the idiosyncracies of the Black Dog, like 16 people standing behind the counter and nobody helping you. But at least it had a funky character about it."
To many in the island, the troubles at the Black Dog simply mirror the struggles of the Vineyard, which has ridden the same wave of popularity and suffered the consequences -- skyrocketing real estate values that threaten to make the island unaffordable to longtime residents. 
The ominous suspicion about the restaurant's fate, said Mr. Schneider, is that "if the Black Dog had it coming, what's coming for us?"

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Welfare Bill's Tougher Love May Backfire

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
IS more far-reaching welfare reform really necessary? The original version, passed in 1996, reduced welfare caseloads by 50 percent, with most of the progress occurring by 2000. Congress is now working on reauthorizing funds for the Temporary Aid for Needy Families program, created in the 1996 legislation. Yet the bill passed by House Republicans last week doesn't promise much more progress on lowering caseloads, and some experts say it may do more harm than good.
 The bill ratchets up work requirements for welfare recipients and allows states to combine different types of entitlement programs, potentially at a cost to the breadth of coverage. But experts doubt that the bill will really help welfare recipients or save money for state governments, which run the programs. 
 "What problem is the legislation trying to solve?" asked Sharon Parrott, co-director of federal welfare policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research group in Washington. "What's the big problem that means every state needs to restructure its program?"
The Republicans' main goal is to increase the share of welfare recipients who work, now at 35 to 40 percent, to 50 percent in 2003 and 70 percent in 2007. That might be tough. Most of the people who are likely to find jobs do so shortly after they start looking. The share of welfare recipients who work rose mostly in the first two years after the 1996 welfare reform.
Bringing the work rate up to 70 percent will require tackling the harder cases -- those involving special problems like substance abuse and poor mental health. But there are other obstacles.
Another part of the Republicans' proposal would increase the amount of time that recipients must spend in actual work -- not in a rehabilitation or educational program -- to 24 hours a week from 20. So people whose personal problems make holding down a job difficult will have less time to address them.
The bill would also narrow the set of activities that would count as work, newly excluding vocational training and job readiness programs. "The House bill says everybody needs to be in a very rigid set of activities," Ms. Parrott said.
During the boom times after the 1996 reform, finding jobs for welfare recipients was not too hard. The bigger headache, Ms. Parrott said, was making sure that people kept their jobs. That situation is changing. "With the economy softening, it does make it a lot more difficult for people to find jobs," she said.
A weakened economy can be a double problem for welfare recipients looking for work. Scarcity of jobs is only the first part of the story; the second part is more subtle: when unemployment rises, there are usually more skilled people looking for jobs, perhaps even jobs for which they are overqualified. These are the sorts of people with whom welfare recipients may have trouble competing. The unemployment rate jumped to 6 percent in April, and some economists believe that the worst is yet to come.
In order to meet the work participation rates in the House bill, states will have to devote more resources to their harder cases. But almost all states are having a tough time making ends meet this year, and the House bill freezes funds for the Temporary Aid for Needy Families program at their current amount.
"The idea that states are actually going to pick up the tab for this, in the middle of state fiscal crises, is preposterous," Ms. Parrott said. At least 30 have seen their welfare rolls grow.
MAKING people work while they're on welfare won't necessarily turn that trend around.
"It's unlikely we'll see any further declines in the immediate future" in welfare rolls, said Philip M. Dearborn, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. "It looks to me that this is not strictly a matter of the recession, since this plateauing started before the recession."
A growing share of the remaining welfare recipients, Mr. Dearborn explained, are children living with grandparents or other relatives. In those cases, he said, "there is no parent to go to work, or to be involved in workfare." 
Mr. Dearborn therefore worries that the House bill is aiming at the wrong target. Rather than adding more tough love for welfare recipients, he'd like to see a continued focus on lowering welfare rolls. "I don't think the changes that are being proposed will have much effect on the number of cases remaining," he said. "If there's not going to be any further reduction, are we going to be satisfied?"

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH: Edmund M. Notzon III; 
T. Rowe Price Personal Strategy Growth Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
EDMUND M. NOTZON III, who steers the $350 million T. Rowe Price Personal Strategy Growth fund, is looking overseas for more of its growth.
 "We think that a lot of the productivity increases that we've seen in the United States in the last decade we will see overseas, especially in Europe," Mr. Notzon said from his office in Baltimore. The fund currently has a 20 percent stake in foreign stocks, up from a typical 16 percent. 
 Mr. Notzon has also put more money into smaller stocks, which now make up 8.5 percent of the fund, versus a usual 6 percent. "Typically, small-cap stocks are more sensitive to economic conditions than bigger companies," he said, "so we expect them to react more positively as the economy continues to improve."
The fund returned 1.6 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, versus losses of 4.6 percent for its category of large blend funds and 5.2 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500, according to Morningstar Inc. It lost 3.9 percent in the last 12 months, versus declines of 13.7 percent for its group and 13.4 percent for the S.& P. 500.
Mr. Notzon, 56, is a managing director of T. Rowe Price Associates, the fund's adviser. He also runs the $270 million Personal Strategy Income and $690 million Personal Strategy Balanced funds and an additional $10 billion, mostly for institutions.
The three Personal Strategy funds are divided among stocks, bonds and cash to reflect varying degrees of risk and potential return; the Growth fund is the most aggressive, with about 80 percent of assets in stocks and the remainder in bonds.
Mr. Notzon directs asset allocation as chairman of a committee that meets at least monthly. Others pick individual securities. The committee generally changes the asset mix about three or four times a year, typically no more than one or two percentage points in any direction, across all sectors. 
"We're not trying to decide what will do well in the next quarter," Mr. Notzon said. "We're looking for sectors that seem to be attractively priced relative to other sectors." 
That accounts for the fund's relatively low turnover rate, 59 percent in 2001 versus 97 percent for other large blend funds, Morningstar said.
In Personal Strategy Growth, Mr. Notzon has about 25.5 percent of assets in large-cap growth stocks and 27 percent in large-cap value stocks, both typical positions for the fund. About four-fifths of the bond portion is in investment-grade issues with the rest in junk bonds.
Raymond A. Mills, a vice president of the T. Rowe Price Group, picks the fund's European stocks. He favors Parmalat Finanziaria of Italy, known for dairy and food products including packaged, nonrefrigerated milk. Parmalat gets one-third of its revenue in the United States and Canada. 
The fund started buying shares in September 2001; it has paid an average price of 3.40 euros, or $3.01, at the times of purchase. The stock, traded on the Milan exchange, closed on Friday at 3.44 euros.
The company's growth has accelerated in the last year, but the stock, despite recent gains, remains inexpensive relative to its industry and its earnings growth potential, Mr. Mills said. Management, he added, is restructuring operations to control costs and expand profit margins. 
GREG McCRICKARD, a Price managing director, picks the small-cap stocks. He likes the Scotts Company, the lawn and garden care concern based in Marysville, Ohio. The fund started buying shares in January, paying an average of $46.48; they now trade at $48.78. New management has taken aggressive steps to improve return on invested capital, Mr. McCrickard said; he expects earnings per share to grow 25 percent a year, on average, for the next three years. 
The company has dominant market share in its category, he added, and increasing cash flow will help it improve its balance sheet.
Patrick Cassidy, a Price vice president who picks the fund's bonds, bought an issue of McCormick & Company, the spice and flavorings producer, in January 2001. He paid $99.801 for a 6.4 percent coupon issue due February 2006; it closed on Friday at $102.86, and is rated A- by S.& P. A strong market position and increasing demand for spicy and more highly flavored foods let the company generate above-average profit margins and strong cash flow, he said.

HEADLINE: The Last Sociologist 

BYLINE:  By Orlando Patterson; Orlando Patterson is a professor of sociology at Harvard and author of "Rituals of Blood," the second volume of a trilogy on race relations.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
The Lonely Crowd," the book for which David Riesman is best known, was published more than half a century ago. It remains not only the best-selling book by a professional sociologist in American history, but arguably one that has had the widest influence on the nation at large. The work of Mr. Riesman, who died May 10, inevitably raises questions about the claims and limitations of academic sociology today.
 In "The Lonely Crowd" and other works, Mr. Riesman provided middle-class Americans with a sharply focused view of their major cultural preoccupations. Then as now, Americans were concerned about the threat to personal freedom posed by the conformism and homogeneity inherent in mass-consumption society. They longed for connection in their pursuit of suburban affluence. They struggled with the contradictory tendency of capitalist individualism to undermine other forms of individualism through a ruthless "ethic of callousness" and celebration of greed. And they tried to reconcile their autonomy with genuine compassion. 
 He also gave the nation a vocabulary for the discussion of what his graceful prose had seduced them to gaze at. In "The Lonely Crowd," he analyzed the anxieties of American life, identifying the ways in which individuals and groups responded to the fast-changing postwar culture.
And yet David Riesman died discarded and forgotten by his discipline. Even Harvard's department of sociology, which he had served for over 30 years, recently discontinued a lecture series named for him after only two years. I gave the last David Riesman lecture in October 2000. It was, I think, the last public event David attended, and he was very happy about it. As he was my mentor, so was I.
The dishonoring of David Riesman, and the tradition of sociology for which he stood, is not a reflection of their insignificance. It is merely a sign of the rise in professional sociology of a style of scholarship that mimics the methodology and language of the natural sciences -- in spite of their inappropriateness for the understanding of most areas of the social world.
Anxious to achieve the status of economics and the other "soft sciences," the gatekeepers of sociology have insisted on a style of research and thinking that focuses on the testing of hypotheses based on data generated by measurements presumed to be valid. This approach works reasonably well for the study of certain subjects like demographics in which there is stability in the variables studied. Business schools, for example, have increasingly turned to organizational sociologists for a more realistic interpretation of the behavior of firms than that provided by economists.
Unfortunately, for most areas of social life -- especially those areas in which the general public is interested -- the methods of natural science are not only inappropriate but distorting. (It is important to note here that the issue is not the use of statistics. Mr. Riesman encouraged their use where appropriate.)
Americans tend to be highly skeptical of generalizations of social interaction. Yet they are deeply interested in knowing what is distinctive about their patterns of behavior, beliefs and values. They welcome attempts to understand what forces in society influence them to act the way they do. Another great sociologist and a contemporary of Mr. Riesman, Erving Goffman, gave them just that in books like "The Sociology of Everyday Life."
These two scholars -- and others like C. Wright Mills, William F. Whyte, Daniel Bell, Nathan Glazer and Peter Berger -- practiced a sociology different in both style and substance from that of today. It was driven first by the significance of the subject and second by an epistemological emphasis on understanding the nature and meaning of social behavior. This is an understanding that can only emerge from the interplay of the author's own views with those of the people being studied.
These writers, following an earlier tradition, pursued big issues like the cultural contradictions of capitalism, the role of religion in economic life, the problems of America's melting-pot ideology, the nature of civil society and the virtues and dangers of patriotism. But they also painted on small canvases, offering us insights into American rituals of interaction in public and private places. They wrote about the ways we avoid each other, the ravages of stigma, the search for honor behind the behavior of young men in gangs on street corners. Their ideas became pervasive, entering the language with terms like "inner-directed," "power elite" and "masking techniques."
Mr. Riesman, in particular, was a pioneer in the study of popular culture, writing brilliantly on the role of the car and of comics. A landmark essay he wrote 50 years ago on youth and pop music was recently reissued in a definitive collection of essential readings on the rock 'n' roll revolution. Even in the world of music criticism, Mr. Riesman was considered relevant.
Today, when mainstream sociologists write about culture they disdain as reactionary any attempt to demonstrate how culture explains behavior. And their need to test hypotheses, build models and formulate laws forces them into an emphasis on the organizational aspects of culture, which can be reduced to data suitable for "scientific" analysis.
Thus in much of modern sociology one learns little or nothing about literature or art or music or religion, even in sociologies that purport to study these subjects. Mainstream sociology eschews any exploration of human values, meanings and beliefs because ambiguities and judgment are rarely welcomed in the discipline now.
Americans are as eager today for analysis of how they live as they were when Mr. Riesman wrote "The Lonely Crowd." Now as then, they want to be informed (in a language they can understand) about their beliefs and cultural practices.
Since mainstream sociology has abandoned this important mission, the intellectual vacuum has been filled by legions of scholars, mainly from the humanities, and commentators in the press. Most have little insight into social, political or cultural issues. In the academy, they have made a frightening intellectual mess of so-called cultural studies. In the popular culture, Americans who want informed sociological essays and thoughtful reflections turn to literary commentators or, less helpfully, to writers of self-help books or hosts of television talk shows.
Sociology is hardly alone in this pseudo-scientific narrowing of purpose and methods on the nation's campuses. Many political science departments, for example, have been hijacked by "rational choice" theorists who disdain the study of political beliefs and culture. There are occasional hopeful signs pointing in other directions, often in small journals or quarterlies published by academic departments or individuals committed to independent thought.
It is that independence, that confidence in ideas, that is most lacking in the academy now. About this, too, Mr. Riesman had something to say. To participate in public life, as anyone who does so knows, requires something he called "the nerve of failure" and defined as "the courage to face aloneness and the possibility of defeat in one's personal life or one's work without being morally destroyed."
David Riesman had that nerve. Would that more in the academy did.

When Backyards Were Laboratories

BYLINE:  By HENRY FOUNTAIN 

 BODY:
ECONOMICS may be the dismal science, but these days the news about chemistry, physics and biology is fairly dismal as well. At the end of April, the National Science Foundation released its biannual report on the state of science and to no one's surprise, public understanding and attitudes have been found wanting.
 A bare majority of Americans, for instance, know that it takes the Earth a year to orbit the Sun, according to a survey conducted for the report. More than half think that the dinosaurs and the earliest humans coexisted, and that lasers work with sound waves. 
 Scientific illiteracy in the United States is not a new problem, of course, and the foundation's analysis contained the usual hand-wringing about the state of science education, particularly in secondary schools. But perhaps the problem goes beyond the classroom, to what happens when school is out. 
For many children, particularly boys, free play used to mean fiddling around with a chemistry set in the basement or lighting things on fire in the backyard. These days, with parents' penchant for overscheduling their children, there is less time for such youthful experimentation. 
This is not all bad -- no doubt fewer children are getting hurt. But backyard tinkering used to lead, if not to a scientific career, at least to continued informal pursuit of science as an adult hobby. If that is not so much the case anymore -- if yesterday's youthful tinkerers no longer grind their own telescope mirrors, build radios or order weather balloons by mail from Edmund Scientific -- something important may have been lost. 
"Parents tell me their kids don't do much of it, mainly because they make sure their kids' days are fully scheduled from breakfast to lights-out," said Homer Hickam, whose best-selling memoir, "Rocket Boys" (Delacorte, 1998), recounted his youthful adventures exploring rocketry in a West Virginia coal town in the Sputnik era. "It's a shame," he said via e-mail. "I had a lot of time on my hands when I was growing up and learned to fill that time with imaginative pursuits."
Youthful tinkering can often lead to a career in science or engineering. Mr. Hickam, for example, was a NASA engineer before turning to writing. And the founders of Apple Computer, Stephen Wozniak and Steven P. Jobs, famously pieced together their first computers on a wooden workbench in a California garage. 
"In the old days, we got good engineers because people got to focus on it early," said William Gurstelle, an engineer in Minneapolis. Many of those engineers, he said, came from rural areas, where as they grew up they faced a choice. "There was nothing to do in those towns except drink and tinker," Mr. Gurstelle said. "You either went one direction or the other."
Alarmed about the lack of tinkering, Mr. Gurstelle wrote a book, "Backyard Ballistics" (Chicago Review Press, 2001), that features simple and safe pyrotechnic experiments for older children, including potato cannons and tennis-ball mortars. But the problems he had getting it published, he said, illustrate another reason that tinkering is in decline.
MR. GURSTELLE said he left some of the riskier projects out of the manuscript (including a simulated grain elevator explosion) and included a long section about safety, but the book was still rejected by many publishers who were scared about the potential for lawsuits. 
But the potential for lawsuits may not be the only reason for the decline in tinkering. For one thing, there's stiff competition from television, video games, computers and other distractions. For another, science hobbies aren't so simple anymore.
"The things that people could work on right now have gotten really complicated," Mr. Gurstelle said. People are considered adept, for example, if they can swap out a computer hard drive. Almost no one can get inside a drive and repair it. People who as teenagers three or four decades ago could tune their own cars with little more than a timing gun would need thousands of dollars of equipment, and a course of study at a trade school, to do so today.
But a little complexity is not necessarily so bad, said Shawn Carlson, director of the Society for Amateur Scientists and the last writer of the Amateur Scientist column in Scientific American (the column was canceled several years ago). Sure, Mr. Carlson said, Heathkit build-it-yourself radios are no longer available, but these days, for not very much money, a hobbyist can buy an exceptional radio that will allow a level of involvement and discovery that wouldn't have been possible before. Very few people grind telescope mirrors anymore, but for someone with an interest in astronomy there are good, relatively inexpensive telescopes that make it easy to explore the heavens.
"Do you lose something by not making your own telescope?" Mr. Carlson said. "Of course you do. But at the same time, a lot of people can get involved who couldn't have before."
MR. CARLSON thinks there are still plenty of opportunities for people, young or old, to be involved in science, although admittedly they may be more formal than before. There are birding programs, museums that organize dinosaur digs, model rocketry clubs and robotics clubs, to name just a few. (Clubs for building fighting robots have become especially popular, and even Mr. Gurstelle acknowledges that they are a "tinkerer's delight.")
The important thing, Mr. Carlson said, "is to try to identify those people who have an aptitude and an interest in science and give them all the help they need to take it as far as they can."
Mr. Hickam said that in his travels, he occasionally attends local science fairs and sees first-hand those children who have a passion for science. "Some don't care how anything works as long as it does," he said. "But others, mostly the minority, have a natural curiosity about things and will eventually, no matter how structured their life, haul out a screwdriver and have at it."

Nationhood: Putting Out More Flags

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL T. KAUFMAN 

 BODY:
AT some point Monday, the Democratic Republic of East Timor will be born as an independent and sovereign country just like all the member states of the United Nations and also Switzerland, which is not in the United Nations. But that is another story.
 This story is that 27 years after Portugal relinquished colonial control over East Timor, and after Indonesia tried to take the region by force, the persistent aspirations for independence of most of the 800,000 East Timorese have now triumphed. It is expected that once the new government in Dili files its application the United Nations will accept it as its 190th member. 
 So, starting tomorrow, East Timor is a country. This is obviously a big deal for its citizens and for those who sympathized with its struggle for self-determination, but meaning no disrespect, it seems like a good time to ask: what does it mean to become a country? What do you get? What can you do? And once you have sovereignty, exactly what do you do to maintain it?
Ralf Dahrendorf, a sociologist and the former director of the London School of Economics, has thought quite a bit about state-building and has written about it as a three-stage process. The first, which he calls the "hour of the lawyers," is when new constitutions are written, including basic rights and the rule of law. There has been a lot of this going around -- not only with new states, like East Timor, but with some old ones that needed to come up with new charters after Communism collapsed.
The second stage, which Lord Dahrendorf identified in an article, involves the creation of a market economy, with the adoption of measures to protect and promote competition and adopt a social safety net.
The third phase centers on the establishment of civil society, the building of "substantial sources of power outside the state and, more often than not, against the state."
How long will all this take? According to Lord Dahrendorf, the first stage might last some six months, the second, six years and the third, 60 years. By this reckoning, most countries are not currently mature.
After all, back in 1945, when the United Nations first started, there were only 51 countries in the international organization. Since then 138 more came into being. And some of the original members, like the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia, collapsed with their fragmented parts turning over new leaves -- constitutionally, economically and in their attitudes to civil society.
So, naturally, a lot of what brand-new and recycled states first emphasize is constitution writing. Herman Schwartz, a constitutional law professor at American University, has closely watched and often advised on the process in emerging nations like the Czech Republic, Bulgaria, Estonia, Mongolia and South Africa. "Everyone was different," he observed. "Usually they tried to go back to something in their own history -- either real or imagined. In Bulgaria, for example, a unicameral legislature had been traditional, so they favored that."
In South Africa, Professor Schwartz said, skilled lawyers drew up a singular system in which the legislature elects a national president. "With a unifying leader like Nelson Mandela," he said, "that made sense."
But what can a state focus on once it has drafted its charter and before it has developed a well-functioning free economy or built up civil society, particularly if external and internal enemies are leaving it alone? Well, there is always flag waving, patriotic anthems and the modern derivative of heraldry like postage stamps and national Internet domain designations.
One of the more colorful passages in the East Timorese constitution spells out the significance of the handsome new flag that will be flying over the country. The yellow portion reflects "the period of colonialism"; a black triangle stands "for the obscurantism that needs to be overcome." The red background denotes "the struggle for national liberation," and a white five-pointed star in the black area signifies peace. 
JUST as international lawyers advise on constitutions, there presumably are international designers eager to land a national account to come up with a new flag and national logo. But local political leaders often keep such matters under their own control. On the eve of the independence of Grenada, for example, in February 1974, Eric M. Gairy, the man who was to become prime minister, was proudly showing off a brightly colored drawing that featured an armadillo rampant. He said he had designed it for the country's coat of arms.
Such symbols are, of course, important for both nation-building and state-building. In some cases they can also translate into cash. For years, the small Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan has contracted out the production of exotic postage stamps. These are sold to stamp collectors all over the world, bringing appreciable returns to the national treasury. Some Bhutanese stamps play music, others are three dimensional and many have subjects that have nothing to do with Bhutan, like reproductions of Impressionist art or portraits of Albert Einstein and Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
Even more innovative was the island state of Tuvalu's sale of the rights to its national slice of cyberspace. Thinking that the country's domain suffix of .tv would be a much sought-after address, a Canadian entrepreneur agreed to pay $50 million over 12 years to the government of Tuvalu. As of last year, the entrepreneur had paid $18 million, which reportedly raised the tiny country' s gross domestic product by 50 percent. 
As for anthems, there is a tantalizing Web site (www.thenationalanthems.com) where the national hymns of 193 countries can be heard while English translations of the lyrics are shown. Another section offers anthems of 35 regions where the idea of becoming a country has varying appeal, from Chechnya and Tibet to Puerto Rico and Gibraltar. Predictably, there is a good deal of repetition, with many anthems alleging that God happens to favor their countries. Poland's anthem sets a standard for modesty and reduced expectations with its refrain claiming, "Poland is not yet lost while we are still alive." A few others recall the tempo and spirit of "Hymn to Freedonia," the stirring Marxist anthem from "Duck Soup." 
Sheldon Harnick, the lyricist of such Broadway shows as "Fiorello!," says he has never written a real anthem. "I would love to do it," he said, "but I would have to feel passionate about the theme." Great anthems like "The Star Spangled Banner" and the "Marseillaise" "were written by people who were carried away," he added. "It's not the sort of thing you can commission from a close friend or relative of the leader."

To the Editor:
 In your article on school choice, "Pick One" (April 28), you focused on largely English-speaking, white, upper-middle-class neighborhoods, Cobble Hill and Boerum Hill, Brooklyn. We live in a more economically and ethnically diverse neighborhood, Ditmas Park, and faced the choice of public or private for our son. 
Many home-buyers here do not consider public schools, but we decided to look at them. It became clear that our two public schools, which have large immigrant populations, offer quality education, good administrators and teachers and a diverse student body. 
 Our son, now in fourth grade, has received an academic education to equal that of a private school as well as an understanding of different cultures, friendships with children from varied economic situations and an unbiased view of the world.

The Pursuit of Quality (Vacation) Time

BYLINE:  By JULIA MEURLING 

 BODY:
It's nearly summer, and two out of every three Americans are planning vacations, many with families and budgets in mind.
 Family time together is a priority for travelers this year, according to a survey by Trip.com, a leisure travel Web site. 
"The significance of bonding with family and friends has really hit home for many vacationers this year, particularly for the first summer following the events of Sept. 11," said Evans Gebhardt, chief marketing officer of Trip Network, which operates Trip.com. 
 Twenty-six percent of the 2,172 adults surveyed last month plan to vacation at the homes of friends or relatives. They expect to spend, on average, $795, less than half the $1,615 average for a sightseeing vacation. JULIA MEURLING

Nasdaq Index Has Its Best Week in a Year

BYLINE:  By SHERRI DAY 

 BODY:
The technology sector rebounded last week, lifting the Nasdaq composite index to its biggest weekly gain in more than a year.
 Much of the optimism was linked to better-than-expected earnings from technology bellwethers like Applied Materials and Dell Computer. 
Applied Materials, a leading supplier of chip-making equipment, also said new orders had increased significantly. 
 The gains weren't confined to technology. Lands' End rose after Sears, Roebuck announced on Monday that it planned to acquire the company. Shares of Wal-Mart Stores and J. C. Penney jumped on reports of solid first-quarter earnings. Other retailers were helped by a government report that said retail sales rose 1.2 percent in April.
 In another sign that shoppers may be more willing to spend money, the University of Michigan reported on Friday that its consumer sentiment index rose to 96 in May from 93 a month earlier.
 For the week, the Nasdaq rose 140.89 points, or 8.8 percent, to 1,741.39. The Dow Jones industrial average added 413.16 points, or 4.2 percent, closing at 10,353.08. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 51.60 points, or 4.9 percent, ending at 1,106.59. SHERRI DAY

HEADLINE: Financial Crisis May Sideline Part of England's Soccer Tradition 

BYLINE:  By WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: NOTTINGHAM, England 

 BODY:
It is a Saturday afternoon ritual across England. Crowds of people in their team colors and stripes swarm the streets of towns and cities, and they stream -- often with detours through pubs -- toward the stadiums where local soccer teams are playing.
 In past decades, the English game was sometimes better known for its riots in the stands than for its play on the field. But today it has become a hearty, family-friendly weekend outing that fills stadium seats with scarf-waving, chanting fans. 
 It has also become a lasting expression of local character at a time when the national branding of institutions like banks, department stores, restaurants and newspapers has left the home soccer team as one of the few local things in English life.
But the game now faces a new threat -- the withdrawal of lucrative television contracts that the 72 local teams in the English Football League below the elite 20-team national Premier League, or Premiership, depend upon for their survival.
The owners of ITV Digital say they cannot pay the $260 million they promised the league this year for broadcasting its games. Negotiations are under way to come up with a reduced figure, and news reports suggest that up to 30 teams could go bankrupt this summer.
The new financial crisis does not affect the teams in the Premiership like Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Newcastle United and Chelsea, which easily attract millions of television dollars. But it has focused attention on the lower-division clubs and their roles in their communities.
Nottingham is a thriving city of 270,000 in the British Midlands that became prosperous during the Industrial Revolution as the center for lace and hosiery. Notts County is the oldest league team in England, founded in 1862, a year before the Football Association was formed.
Local soccer teams can be the best organizations to assist programs and projects that were once the concerns of unions, business groups and crusading town newspapers. 
Notts County and other clubs have recreation programs involving thousands of local youths, and they often provide the secondary education for the teenagers who are most skilled and interested in soccer careers. Team managements rent out facilities, and many teams are often major local property developers.
Team pride is deep. Across the Trent River is the stadium of the city's other soccer team, Nottingham Forest, a first-division club, also on hard financial times. A proposal to merge the teams sank quickly. 
A second-division club, Notts County was expecting $990,000 from ITV Digital; first-division teams were due $4.2 million each. The Notts County chairman, Albert Scardino, an American based in London who once was a spokesman for a New York City mayor, David N. Dinkins, believes the league will prove more resilient than the doomsayers think.
"Most of these clubs have been through two world wars, financial panic and lots of boardroom battles," he said.
For now, fans are responding to appeals for money -- last month, Notts County asked for the equivalent of $7,500 and received $220,000.
Many of those fans went to Notts County games with their fathers and have seen their own children and grandchildren become regulars. "Our blood runs black and white," said Clive Ashmore, 60, a restaurant owner in nearby Radcliffe-on-Trent, referring to the team colors. Doug Ward, 64, a retired auto dealer, said, "Around here it's nearly a religion."

HEADLINE: PORTRAITS OF GRIEF: THE VICTIMS; 
Sports Fanatic, Good Samaritan, Enthusiastic Dad, Multilinguist

BYLINE:  These sketches were written by Anthony DePalma, Aaron Donovan, Constance L. Hays, Lynette Holloway, Tina Kelley and Melena Ryzik. 

 BODY:
Here are glimpses of some of the victims of the Sept. 11 attack on the World Trade Center.

JOHN CORCORAN
Frequent Traveler
 In the 20 years that John and Diann Corcoran were married, goodbyes rolled around every 84 days. 
 Mr. Corcoran, known to everyone as Jay, was in the merchant marine, a first engineer on huge cargo ships. His schedule had him sailing all over the Far East for tours of 84 days. When he finished he went home to Norwell, Mass. -- for 84 days.
"Jay often said to me, 'If you add it all up, people who travel for business could be gone as long as I am,"' said Mr. Corcoran's sister Donna Corcoran Schwartz. When he returned from the sea, the first thing Mr. Corcoran, 43, did was catch up on his sleep. Then, his wife said, he was in perpetual motion, golfing, doing yardwork, going on field trips with his children, Meghan and Jake, and working on his cabin in Augusta, Me.
Inevitably, it would be time for another goodbye. On Sept. 11 Mrs. Corcoran drove him to the airport to catch a plane for Los Angeles. It was United flight 175, which would strike the World Trade Center.
They got out of the car and embraced. As Mr. Corcoran went through the doors, Mrs. Corcoran wanted to call him back. "I'd get that panic every time he traveled," she said. As always, she let him go. Then she got back into her car, already anticipating -- as she did at every goodbye -- "the next hello."

DONALD W. ROBERTSON JR.
Ireland in His Soul
 It was hard to find a photograph of Donald W. Robertson Jr., 35, for the prayer card for his memorial Mass. A father of four, he was seen in all his pictures with a child climbing on him. The family had to crop him out of a family reunion shot to get a photo without a small arm or leg draped around him.
"His little girl, Madison, would only let Donnie put her pierced earrings in her ears," said one of his sisters, Kathy Cunningham. "That is the ultimate hands-on, gentle dad."
She remembers her mother making her take her brother, who was almost nine years younger, to church. "But she didn't know that we'd pull up, he'd run in, get the bulletin, come back out, and the car full of us would drive off to Friendly's," Ms. Cunningham recalled. "He was along for the ride in every way."
Although Mr. Robertson, a vice president of sales with eSpeed, who lived in Rumson, N.J., had a shamrock tattoo, he never made it to Ireland. His mother is taking ashes from ground zero to an ancient burial ground in Glendalough, County Wicklow, in a few weeks, his father said. On March 9, an Irish flag flew over the New Jersey governor's mansion in his honor.

EDWARD A. BRENNAN III
Sports-Loving Fiance
 Edward A. Brennan III was wild about sports, so he would read the sports pages before starting the day at Cantor Fitzgerald, where he was a vice president and a bonds broker.
"One day, he walked away from his desk and left his newspaper," said his mother, Gail Brennan. "The guy next to him removed the sports section and added the living section from another newspaper to watch his reaction. My son came back and went bananas. He said, 'That so-and-so put two living sections in my paper!' Everyone around him collapsed laughing because they knew that it was the first thing that he did in the morning."
Mr. Brennan, 37, whom everyone called Teddy, was known for his sharp mind and uncanny sense of humor. "He had an amazing mind for math," his mother said. He was an avid golfer, playing at a club on the Jersey Shore, not far from his native Sea Girt, where he had hoped to retire. The strapping blond man had an eclectic style of dress on the golf course: black golf socks and a golf shirt two sizes too small, buttoned up to the neck. Mrs. Brennan said that he probably wore the shirts to show off his biceps, which he worked hard to develop.
Mr. Brennan was the oldest and only male of four siblings, including twins. He was engaged to be married to Meghan Daly, whom he had met about two years before Sept. 11.

PATRICK CURRIVAN
Inquisitive Voyager
Patrick Currivan was intensely curious, which made him a wonderful traveler. "Whatever chance he got he quizzed people," said Kathy Marshall, a neighbor who visited Egypt with him. "He really delved into their understanding and knowledge of their own country, where they were and who they were, and he constantly asked questions. And if you were smart, you stood around and waited to hear the answers."
He had traveled extensively on the Silk Route and in Syria, and was particularly interested in the richness of Islamic culture, visiting mosque after mosque in Cairo, said Ms. Marshall's husband, Paul.
Mr. Currivan, 52, a vice president at Atos-Euronext, was born in Ireland and had moved about a decade ago from Paris to Winchester, Mass. He was on Flight 11. His friend John Adamson remembers Mr. Currivan as a gifted talker. "He would drop a well-chosen phrase or word into a conversation, then stand back and watch the effect with a big twinkle in his eye."

DAMION MOWATT
Worked for Better Days
 Damion Mowatt used to take his youngest brother, Andre, to a club to play basketball, and would help him out by buying sneakers for him. 
Mr. Mowatt, 21, worked at Forte Food Service, which served the World Trade Center, and he had been thinking about going to college. "He wanted to work to pay his part," said his mother, Andrea Mowatt.
"He looked at the World Trade Center as a landmark," she said. "He wasn't thinking of it being like a target. When he'd talk about the World Trade Center, it was always with a lift, like it was good to be working up there."
Mrs. Mowatt was 15 when he was born, in Jamaica. "For someone so young, who was not working, it was not easy for us," she said. "I had this bond with him, from a lot of struggle."
They used to talk for hours in the kitchen, in Flatbush, Brooklyn, while she cleaned up after meals. "Damion, I just finished washing dishes and I am thinking about you as I do every day," she wrote on a Web site dedicated to him. "Every day you are with us. So long as our heart is beating, yours is too."

STUART S. LOUIS
Sand-Dappled Memories
 It was hot in Chinatown in the summer, so in 1955 Stuart Louis's mother bought a bungalow in Bradley Beach, N.J. Friday-night memories are salt-tinged for the Louis children, who rolled the car windows down as they sped along an hour's worth of highway toward the sea.
Other families from Chinatown followed, and soon there was a community where the grandmothers played mah-jongg all afternoon and the children grew up running along the sand together. Stuart Louis befriended a boy named Bobby Louie (their last names are written the same way in Chinese, and both mean thunder.) They were inseparable, said Mr. Louis's sister, Sylven Beck. He married Bobby's sister, Sharon, and Bobby was his best man.
Mr. Louis rose to become managing director at Sandler O'Neill, on the 104th floor of 2 World Trade Center. He and Sharon had two children, Kara and Evan. Mr. Louis, 43, would get home to East Brunswick, N.J., in time to attend parent-teacher conferences and to help Kara and Evan with their homework. "He made it fun," his wife said.
"He was more of a family man than most people," Gordon Russo, a former colleague, recalled. And family included the Yankees. When there was a ticker-tape parade through the Canyon of Heroes for his team, he slipped out of the office and stood on the sidewalk cheering, pennant in hand.

DORIS S. TORRES
Small in Stature Only
 Doris S. Torres was soft-spoken, sweet, and very petite -- about five feet tall. But "she had so much inner strength that she seemed to be like seven feet tall," said her sister, Mercedes.
On Sept. 11 and for a few days after, Ms. Torres made great use of that strength. She worked in foreign trade for Fiduciary Trust International, and left her office on the 97th floor of the south tower as soon as the first plane hit the north tower. She helped an emotional colleague down a few flights and returned to help others. Ms. Torres eventually made it out of the building, but she was severely burned. She was taken to St. Vincent's Manhattan Hospital, where she died on Sept. 16, her family said.
Ms. Torres, 32, was a private woman, but she kept her family close. She shared a house in the Bronx with her mother, Blanca Cruz-Aquino. "I miss her every day," Mrs. Cruz-Aquino said. "I continue to hear her steps every morning, coming down the steps to go to work."
The eldest of four children raised in Brooklyn, Ms. Torres considered raising her son, Anthony Small, 15, her greatest accomplishment. "Her biggest passion and her biggest pride was her son," said Ms. Torres's sister, who is now his guardian. "They were very close."
It is a pride that they now return, many times over. "She is my hero," said Mrs. Cruz-Aquino. "I have my hope that some day I'm going to hug her and give her a kiss. I know I will."

DONALD T. JONES II
Brimming With Confidence
 Donald T. Jones II had confidence to spare, and it began in the cradle. "He was a salesman," said his younger brother, William B. Jones II. "He didn't back down from something he wanted."
It helped him rise in the Cantor Fitzgerald hierarchy, where he was hired on the bond desk shortly after college. He spotted Michele Ramirez on her first day of work there and immediately declared he would marry her. It took more than a year, but she eventually agreed.
They had Taylor, now 6, and Donnie, 3. Mr. Jones, who was 39, raced home to Livingston, N.J., from the office to be with them. He taught them his favorite Aerosmith songs and schooled them in the art of blackjack. "There's no Go Fish happening in this house," Mrs. Jones said. 
He showed Taylor, a southpaw, how to play baseball, and bought her a glove. "It makes her very happy," her mother said, "that she has the glove Daddy bought her." He took Donnie with him on long bicycle rides, and gave him a tiny mountain bike for his second birthday. "It was a little too soon," his mother said. "He couldn't use the pedals for a long time. And then after this happened, we took the bike out because it was still nice weather in September. And then we found out he could pedal."

SCOTT A. LARSEN
Fan of Disney World
 When Scott A. Larsen finished a shift at the firehouse -- "He was very good with the tools; he fit right into the place," said Brian Cleary, his friend from Ladder Company 163 -- off he'd go in pursuit of more activity, usually with his three children. He outfitted them with Rollerblades, and got them onto their bicycles on summer days. He could spend an entire day at the beach, then fix dinner on the grill. During the midwinter school break, he packed everyone into the car and drove from their home in Glendale, Queens, to Disney World, stopping to spend the night in North Carolina, to buy sparklers in South Carolina, to sample as many Dairy Queens as possible below the Mason-Dixon line.
It meant 12 hours of driving at a stretch, but he loved it. On arrival, Firefighter Larsen, who was 35, headed for Space Mountain, where he usually rode solo. "He'd try to convince the kids to go on it," said his wife, Carolann. "Once he bribed them with a stuffed animal. They came off scared like anything."
The children are Marisa, 9; Brenda, 8; and Scott, 5. On Sept. 13, their little brother was born. Mrs. Larsen named him August, a name she and her husband had chosen. 

KLAUS SPROCKAMP
A Visitor From Germany
 Johannes Sprockamp, now 6, asks his mother Beate daily if he can call Papa in heaven. On Sept. 11, his father, Klaus Sprockamp, was at an 8:30 a.m. meeting at the World Trade Center that was supposed to last an hour. Mr. Sprockamp, 42, was the chief financial officer and chief operating officer of LION Bioscience AG, a German firm.
He had recently hired Tracy M. Coffey, who was late to that meeting and who has since become friends with his family -- close enough to be able to describe their lives before Sept. 11.
Mr. Sprockamp, she said, loved riding motorcycles until he met Beate, a surgeon. "He just completely fell in love with her, and he stopped with the whole motorcycle thing and settled for a convertible," Ms. Coffey said.
One of his passions was maintaining the hillside landscape surrounding their home in Muhltal, Germany. The boys wanted to be like their father. "Can I mow the lawn now?" Johannes asks.
Johannes is a serious boy, full of thought and wonder. He is quieter now and very often full of anger. His brother, Lucas, 4, has been persistent in the notion that "if the terrorists knew how much we love Papa, they wouldn't have flown the plane into the tower." He just recently began sleeping through the night again.

LINDA JOYCE JONES
Grandma With a Tattoo
 People like to be around someone who enjoys herself, and Linda Joyce Jones enjoyed herself. The daily annoyances of urban life bounced off her like raindrops, and the stresses of her job in the insurance-brokerage business never seemed to get to her, either.
"She was a spiritual uplift for me when I would get depressed," said Gene Sorrenti, who worked with her until the early 1990's.
She went to church, raised a daughter, befriended her husband's eight children from a previous marriage, listened to singers like Luther Vandross, and moved up to a position at Aon, in the World Trade Center, after years at smaller firms.
After her husband, Robert Lee Jones, died a year ago, Mrs. Jones, who was 49 at the time, got herself a new hairstyle and some new clothes. She also got a butterfly tattoo. "It was a midlife crisis, basically," said her daughter, Jennifer. "She just went out and wanted to do for herself."
At night she would come home and play with her only grandchild, Jennifer's infant son, Darrion, who was just 4 months old in September. "A lot of people say he looks a little bit like her," said Miss Jones. "I noticed when his two top teeth came in, he had a gap between them just like my mother's."

ROBERT J. GSCHAAR
Doting Stepfather
 At an Exchange Place office party many Christmases ago, employees of insurance companies traded office gossip and inside jokes. Then Robert J. Gschaar thought of a topic that would interest people regardless of where they worked. "If someone was to play you in a movie," he asked a small cluster of people, "who would that person be?"
The small group grew larger and nearby conversations ended as people overheard the question and joined in. Among them was Myrta Alvarado. "I noticed his eyes," she recalled recently. "They were kind eyes."
After they married in 1989, he helped raise her four daughters from a previous marriage, now 34, 28, 24 and 19. Family members said he treated his stepdaughters as if they were his own children. Three years ago, Mayra Leitner, his eldest stepdaughter, confided in him. "I just felt like everything was going wrong," she recalled. "He said there were people in worse situations than I was and I should always think of them."
After being laid off by an insurance company in Westchester County, he was unemployed for four years, and earned money by working as a temp. By waking up early to work the phones, send resumes and contact headhunters, Mr. Gschaar, 55, who lived in Spring Valley, N.Y., made pursuing a full-time job a job in itself, his wife said.
Mr. and Mrs. Gschaar were overjoyed in July 2001 when he was hired by Aon, the insurance company at 2 World Trade Center. They began planning their first vacation in years. It was to be a cruise, perhaps to Alaska, in September of this year.

ROBERT McMAHON
Great Do-It-Yourselfer
 When he wasn't busy battling flames, Robert McMahon, 35, whom everyone called Bobby, liked to make things. He built a haunted house for children with cancer. He painted landscapes and loved photography. He could turn mute lumber into furniture of distinction.
Over at the Gate, a bar in Park Slope, Brooklyn, there is a set of benches that he created for a friend, "beautiful, churchlike benches," said Julie McMahon, his wife and the mother of their two sons, Matthew, 2, and Patrick, 4 months old. Together they bought the house in Queens that he grew up in, and he pulled it apart and created a vastly improved version. "And he had never done that before," Mrs. McMahon said.
At his firehouse, Ladder Company 20 on Lafayette Street, he was the one who set up the Christmas tree every year, stringing it with lights. He was a good cook, too, which meant clean plates and gratitude all around. He could put together a company-size pan of lasagna so impressive that somebody once slipped the recipe to GQ.
"I used to call him MacGyver," said his friend Mike Hopkins, who worked with him for eight years, "because he pretty much could do anything. If he didn't know how to do something, he would do it anyway, and he would do it really well."

ABDOULAYE KONE
Living the American Dream
 By developing a passion for his craft and never losing sight of his desire to help his family, Abdoulaye Kone worked his way from a clay hut in Ivory Coast to the lofty heights of the World Trade Center, where he was a pastry chef at Windows on the World. "When he first came to this country he was working at a little five-and-dime store," said his wife, Celestine Kone. "He wanted to be successful and probably open up his own business."
Mr. Kone went to culinary school in France to learn pastry making. "He was a very, very sophisticated and educated guy," Mrs. Kone said, listing the languages he learned after the Mandingo and French that he spoke in Africa: English, Spanish, German, a little Italian.

HEADLINE: 'Living Wage' Roulette: A Bigger Paycheck, or a Pink Slip? 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
New York City is playing catch-up on a legislative phenomenon that has swept through Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles and dozens of other cities.
 Nationwide, 83 communities have enacted laws raising wages for thousands of low-paid workers employed by city contractors. Now the New York City Council is considering such a law. 
 Many advocates for the poor hail these so-called living-wage laws, saying they help lift workers out of poverty, usually by increasing pay by $2 to $3 an hour. Opponents say they end up punishing the poor by causing layoffs of some low-paid workers. 
They are both right, according to the most exhaustive study of these laws. 
The study, released in March, concluded that the laws help the low-paid workers they are intended to aid, often janitors or security guards, but push up the unemployment rate for low-wage workers in general.
"These things are often sold as free lunches or win-win situations, but that's simply not the case," said David Neumark, an economics professor at Michigan State University whose study, commissioned by the Public Policy Institute of California, examined living-wage laws in 36 cities. "There is some employment loss, though it's not huge. And some people are earning higher wages, and in some parts of the country they are earning much higher wages."
Professor Neumark pointed to several California cities that require city contractors to pay more than $10 an hour, considerably higher than the $8.10 an hour with health benefits (or $9.60 an hour without) that the New York bill would require. The New York proposal would raise the floor to $10 an hour after five years and would apply to employees of city contractors and companies that get large tax breaks from the city.
Professor Neumark found that the net effect of these laws was positive because, even while increasing unemployment, they help reduce poverty.
"The evidence points to a moderate reduction in urban poverty," he said. "If you love living-wage laws, that probably makes you jump up and down. If you hate living-wage laws, it puts you in a bind."
Conservatives have criticized his study for not focusing more on increased unemployment, while liberals have complained that it exaggerates the growth in joblessness. Professor Neumark has clashed with liberals in the past over minimum-wage increases after conducting studies that found that raising the minimum wage pushes up unemployment and often helps middle-class teenagers instead of the poor. Professor Neumark praised living-wage laws for focusing more narrowly on helping poor workers than minimum-wage laws do.
Living-wage laws have had mixed effects, helping some people and hurting others. These laws have certainly helped people like Marlene Mendoza, a waitress at a restaurant in the Los Angeles International Airport. When Los Angeles enacted its law in 1998, her pay, then $5.75 an hour, jumped by more than $2 an hour. The law requires city contractors to pay at least $7.99 an hour with health benefits or $9.24 an hour without.
"The big difference because of the law is, now I can spend more time with my kids," said Ms. Mendoza, a single mother who juggles two jobs and has a 7-year-old daughter and a 10-year-old son with cerebral palsy. "Before, I had to work 75 hours a week to make ends meet, but now I only have to work 55."
She added that she now had time to help her children with their homework and enough money to afford her first-ever vacation to her native El Salvador. 
Many conservatives say these laws are not the best way to reduce poverty. Richard Toikka, chief economist for the Employment Policies Institute, a business-backed research group, praised the earned-income tax credit, saying it did not push up unemployment. But many city officials say tax credits cost a lot of money, while wage laws have less visible, hard-to-measure effects on budgets.
Officials in several cities said their wage laws had had little impact on their budgets. Mimi Turchinetz, the living-wage administrator for Boston, said the cost to the city was minimal, partly because the hourly wage of $9.11 was not much higher than the wages many companies were already paying.
"For the most part, the cost of the contracts was absorbed by the vendors," she said.
In Oakland, Calif., city officials estimate that their law has raised the cost of city contracts by 2 percent a year. Last year, Oakland's law, which requires $9.13 an hour with health benefits and $10.50 without, raised the wages of 230 workers employed by city contractors by a total of $74,500.
In New York City, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg opposes the bill because it could increase the city's projected $5 billion deficit. His administration says the bill would cost the city $150 million a year, while supporters say it would cost $10 million. In New York, the bill, supported by 45 of the 51 City Council members, would cover 70,000 workers, by some estimates more than all workers covered by the nation's other living-wage laws combined.
Many business executives call these laws an unfair assault on their profits, while other executives give the laws unexpected praise. The loudest cries come from companies in Santa Monica, Calif., where the City Council approved a living-wage law that faces a citywide referendum in November. The proposal would set a wage floor of $10.50 an hour with benefits or $12.25 an hour without for city contractors and hotels and restaurants in the prime coastal zone.
Rick Federico, chairman of a restaurant chain, P. F. Chang's China Bistro, said he might lay off 40 of the 125 employees at his upscale restaurant in Santa Monica if he is forced to give $3-an-hour raises to the many workers who now earn $8. He said he might eliminate several dozen assistant waiters' jobs.
"I estimate that it will cost us $600,000 a year, which would pretty much wipe out our profit margin," Mr. Federico said. "And we won't be able to pass it along through a price increase."
Lynn Kastella, whose firm manages buildings for Tucson, voiced a common criticism of these laws -- it required her firm to hire a full-time contract compliance officer.
Tom Cheske, vice president of Mr. Janitor in Tucson, faulted the law on another ground: it was causing tension at his firm. His employees who earn $6 an hour cleaning private-sector buildings resent co-workers who earn $8.58 an hour cleaning municipal buildings.
"People are under the impression that if you give somebody more money, they're automatically going to be a better employee," Mr. Cheske said. "That's not the case. They might be happier employees, but we haven't seen any change in performance."
But some have a more positive view. At Pedus Services, a security and janitorial firm in Tucson that has more than 100 people doing work for the city, employee turnover has plunged from 16 percent every two weeks to just 1 percent since the law took effect in 2000, raising hourly pay to $8.58 from $5.25. In addition, overtime costs have dropped sharply. 
"You have less people not showing up," said Orlando Duran, Pedus's operations manager. "Before, a lot of people didn't show up some days because they were looking for higher-paying work."
Professor Neumark's study also found that living-wage laws were a boon to municipal labor unions, which have lobbied for these laws. By raising the wage that contractors must pay, he found, these laws make it less tempting for cities to seek to save money by privatizing services.
"These laws really undermine that threat," Professor Neumark said. "As a result, unions representing city workers have greater bargaining power."

HEADLINE: In Europe, Going Global Means, Alas, English 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, May 18 

 BODY:
Ludovic Timbal learned English at school and used it occasionally while studying law in Paris.
 But that never prepared him for the avalanche of English he encountered after he joined a Paris law firm last year. "I want to be a business lawyer, and I realized you just cannot avoid speaking English," Mr. Timbal, 29, said in vaguely accented English. 
 So now Mr. Timbal attends a Paris language school and spends up to four hours several days a week drilling English conversation -- "an investment in the future," he called it.
As European banks and corporations burst national boundaries and go global, many are making English the official corporate language.
Two years ago, when France, Germany and Spain merged their aerospace industries into one company, they not only gave it an English name -- the European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company, or EADS -- they also made English its language.
In Germany, the national postal service, Deutsche Post World Net, increasingly uses English as its working language. Smaller companies are doing likewise. In Finland, the elevator maker Kone adopted English in the 1970's; in Italy, Merloni Elettrodomestici, a midsize home appliance maker, did so in the mid-1990's. Management meetings at big banks like Deutsche Bank in Germany and Credit Suisse in Switzerland are routinely in English.
In part, the triumphal march of English through European business is symbolic, born of a wish to shed a parochial image and assume that of global player. To this extent, the adoption of one language in business is probably not an indication that Europeans are abandoning their cultural identities as they have surrendered their economic nationalism and adopted a single currency.
But there are also substantive reasons to use English, which makes it easier to leverage international links and enable far-flung affiliates to communicate both with headquarters and among themselves.
Behind this choice lies a reality that unsettles some Europeans: the use of English is mainly determined by the unchallenged dominance of the United States in industry, commerce and finance.
"It is the key market in the world as a consumer; it is the center of financial markets," said Subramanian Rangan, associate professor of strategy at the Insead business school outside Paris, whose language of teaching and research is English. "So with regard to products, financing, knowledge and technology, the United States has risen to unparalleled pre-eminence in these last years, and it doesn't seem there are contenders to change that."
In Toulouse, in the south of France, English has been the official language at the aircraft manufacturer Airbus since its founding more than 30 years ago as a loose consortium of aerospace companies from France, Germany, Britain and Spain. Partly, Airbus executives say, this was because of a bad experience on an earlier project, building the Anglo-French Concorde supersonic jet: Concorde's French chief engineer, despite fluent English, refused memos from his British counterpart unless they were in French.
But the choice also reflected American predominance in civil aviation. "Our documentation was often based on American manuals," said Barbara Kracht, the Airbus spokeswoman. "And it was complicated -- you know, there's Boeing slang, G.E. slang, Pratt & Whitney slang."
In executive meetings, if a majority speak French, German or Spanish, then the majority tongue is spoken; the minutes are in English. On the factory floor, local languages prevail.
In Italy, the appliance maker Merloni adopted English in the 1990's. Merloni was a family-controlled, midsize player with a name few had heard of, competing against renowned giants like Electrolux of Sweden and Bosch-Siemens of Germany. Its chief executive at that time, Francesco Caio, believed that English would give Merloni an international image.
The company's subsequent growth cemented the role of English. In 2000, Merloni acquired Stinol, Russia's biggest refrigerator maker, and last December, Britain's Hotpoint, adding 6,000 Britons and 7,000 Russians to the work force. At both Hotpoint and Stinol, English is the language of management.
"I can't give percentages, but now many executives are not Italian -- French, English, Danish, Russian and so on," said Andrea Prandi, Merloni's spokesman. "We consider ourselves a European group. For Europe, the official language is English."
Whether the use of English enables everyone to penetrate intangible cultural issues, and to communicate as closely as, say, the French have among themselves for centuries, is much less clear.
Professor Rangan of Insead suspects that the corporate use of English represents "only shallow integration."
"I doubt it's in the board room, and it's not on the factory floor," he said. "So it's a narrow sliver. It's not in labor relations, and it's not in customer relations."
But it does provide a communication tool, "much the way we use mathematics and numbers," he said.
Jussi Itavuori, a Finn who is group vice president for human resources at EADS, agrees.
"It's neither English nor American," he said. "It's some sort of operating language. It loses quite a lot of nuance."
Indeed, some would argue that English at work drives Europeans back to their native tongues.
Christine Rahard, a Frenchwoman in her 30's, manages corporate communications for the French automaker Renault, working extensively in English.
But in her home village west of Paris, friends and neighbors who increasingly feel the intrusion of English into their working lives share a kind of mild backlash, reaffirming their French roots in food and drink, everyday customs -- and language.
"At the market place on a Saturday morning," she said, "you find people using old words for vegetables that everyone thought died out decades ago."
The spread of English, of course, is a gold mine for language schools. Five years ago, Wall Street Institute, where Mr. Timbal studies, had only three schools in France. Today, there are 38, 8 in Paris alone.
"It reflects the world we live in," said Jeremy Newman, director of Mr. Timbal's school. 
Similarly pervasive is the practice of naming English speakers to top jobs at European companies.
When Myron Ullman, the American executive best known in the 1990's for saving the Macy's department store chain, was hired to be chief executive of the big French-based luxury goods conglomerate LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, he knew his inability to speak French would not be a problem. Years earlier, the LVMH chairman, Bernard Arnault, had made English the group's official language.
Still, the chatter in the cafeteria and around the coffee machine remains in the local tongue, so not having it is recognized as a drawback.
For the time being, European banks and corporations appear set to remain linguistic hybrids, using English as their lingua franca, yet relying on local languages in telling ways. Such an arrangement appears to work against anyone who does not speak the local language.
"It's a definite disadvantage," said Horst Neller, a partner in Dusseldorf, Germany, for the executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles. "In the local language, you open your heart."

HEADLINE: Ethnic Bridges For 3 Minorities On Capitol Hill 

BYLINE:  By LYNETTE CLEMETSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18 

 BODY:
First there were the bonding exercises, in which participants shared ethnic pride.
 Next came a theatrical one-woman show featuring an eclectic roster of characters representing America's changing demographic landscape. 
 Finally, for anyone still not down with the program, a troupe of Latino, Asian and African-American slam poets delivered a rapid-fire dose of street wisdom on the state of the American dream.
It was nothing like a typical Congressional meeting -- and that is just what organizers wanted.
Members of the Congressional Black, Hispanic and Asian Pacific Caucuses slipped away last month to a resort in Northern Virginia for their first tricaucus retreat. The three-day event was an attempt to create an atmosphere of understanding among groups that have often felt pitted against one another for resources and recognition. 
Organizers took pains to convene the gathering under the radar of the news media, "so people could open up and get real without worrying how it would play," a caucus staff member said.
The "getting real" entailed designing a policy agenda focused on education, economic empowerment, health care and immigration that members of the groups hope will begin a new era in coalition politics.
The coalition is already testing its collective bargaining power. One recent success involved the farm bill President Bush signed this week. The black and Hispanic caucuses united on the nutrition section, or title, of the bill to get expanded food stamp subsidies, which the black members wanted, and to get the right to food stamps restored for legal immigrants, a priority for Hispanic members.
"Without a strong and comprehensive nutrition title that addresses the specific interests of both caucuses, there is little reason for many of our caucus members to vote in favor of a farm bill," read a letter from the two groups to the Senate Agriculture Committee. The expanded provisions were adopted.
The coalition also worked -- less successfully -- on provisions it sought in the reauthorization of the welfare bill, which the House passed on Thursday. Among the black caucus's priorities were more money for child care, post-vocational training and waiving mandatory work requirements for grandparent caretakers. 
Chief concerns for the Hispanic and Asian caucuses were again restoring benefits to legal immigrants, which were taken away in 1996, and including English-language instruction and translation services in job training programs. Those provisions were in the Democratic alternative, which was defeated.
The developing agenda of the groups is an effort to realize strength in numbers. The black caucus has 38 members. The Hispanic caucus has 18. While only 9 members of Asian background are in the Asian Pacific caucus, it has dozens of "affiliated members" in Congress with an interest in Asian-related issues.
"Add it all up and that's a tremendous amount of clout that we need to be using more effectively," said Representative Silvestre Reyes, the Texas Democrat who is chairman of the Hispanic caucus.
The combined caucus members are all Democrats, except for two Republicans who are affiliated members of the Asian caucus. There are black and Latino House Republicans who are not part of either caucus.
But for Democratic loyalists, faced with passing legislation in a Republican-controlled administration and an election year in which several races could hinge on cross-ethnic support, catch phrases like "Can't we all just get along?" carry a sense of political urgency.
"We really have much in common when it comes to our goals," said Representative Eddie Bernice Johnson, a Texas Democrat who has made coalition building part of her platform as chairwoman of the black caucus.
Caucus members are looking to Texas, the home state of President Bush, for a shining example of how coalition building can work. 
Ron Kirk, a former two-term mayor of Dallas who is black, won the Democratic nomination to run for the Senate largely because of the backing of the Democratic candidate for governor, Tony Sanchez, who urged voters to help "make history" by nominating Mr. Kirk and creating a brown-black dream ticket.
Much of the thorny space between being partners and adversaries lies in the competition for resources. In the early 1990's, Hispanic legislators began pushing for money to be set aside for "Hispanic serving institutions," like the University of Texas at El Paso and California State University at Los Angeles, which serve predominantly Latino populations.
Initially, several black legislators fought the proposals, fearing that any financing for Hispanic institutions would come at the expense of historically black universities. In 1998, after years of wrangling, the groups created financing for the Hispanic colleges without taking from the black colleges. 
A potentially more contentious issue among the groups is redistricting. Latinos, now at 12.5 percent of the population according to the 2000 census, are expected to overtake African-Americans in several years.
In a few districts the shift is already apparent. In 1990, the area of Los Angeles represented by a black caucus member, Maxine Waters, was 42 percent black and 43 percent Latino. Today the black population has dipped to 35 percent and the Latino population has jumped to 54 percent, according to census figures.
The Latino population in Ms. Johnson's district in Texas has grown to 35 percent from 18 percent in the same period. Other districts in high-growth regions are undergoing similar changes.
Many of the areas with booming Latino populations also have growing Asian populations. As districts are redrawn to strengthen representation for Latinos and Asians, many black politicians fear they will lose hard-won political ground. 
"Given the commonality of purpose, one might think coalition building would be easy and natural, but experience suggests it's not necessarily so," said Charles Kamasaki, senior vice president of the National Council of La Raza, a Latino advocacy group. "What you find is that Hispanics and Asians sometimes feel that African-Americans are sidelining their issues with the same kind of rhetoric and justifications that whites used to use against blacks."
In January a group of Latino businessmen broke away from the National Minority Auto Dealers Association to form their own group, the National Hispanic Auto Dealers Association, asserting that the older group was controlled by African-Americans who were trying to shut them out. The move has generated friction, even within the Latino business community. Opponents of the split say the divisive tactic could hurt both groups.
"What we have to realize is that it's not about a competition for crumbs," said Representative Xavier Becerra, Democrat of California. "It's about elevating the overall status and resources of programs so that they serve everyone." 
Mr. Becerra, a former chairman of the Hispanic caucus who is also an affiliate member of the Asian Pacific caucus, added, "If the leadership is not willing to talk candidly and work through the tough issues, we can't expect people in the communities to work things out."
The tough issues were front and center at the retreat, at the Lansdowne Resort in Leesburg, albeit in the form of entertainment. Audience members sat rapt as Sarah Jones, a socially conscious writer and actress -- the hip-hop generation's Anna Deavere Smith -- slipped in and out of accents to portray characters ranging from a Mexican-American labor organizer to a new immigrant from Haiti who scolded listeners: "God bless America, but not because of you. Remember, your ancestors came here once, too."
Beau Sia, a Chinese-American slam poet from Oklahoma, raised eyebrows with his confrontational number, "The Asians are coming":
We are everywhere. 
We are programming your Web sites,
Making your executives look smart
And getting into your schools -- for free,
And you know what?
It's only gonna get bigger.
For now, leaders of the fledgling tricaucus coalition are playing down their differences in hopes of moving forward with their agenda. "We've had enough of wedge issues," said Representative David Wu, the Oregon Democrat who is chairman of the Asian Pacific caucus. "Right now we need to emphasize the common ground." 
The groups have appointed subcommittees on core issues, and they will meet regularly to update one another. The three caucuses have agreed to make the retreat a yearly event.
At the final session of the first retreat, the inspirational singer Oleta Adams served up what the printed program termed "food for the mind, body and soul." While audience members listened intently, Ms. Adams soulfully crooned songs that cut to the heart of members' respective aspirations and anxieties, including "Everything Must Change" and "This is My Country."
As members of the three caucuses feel their way toward the future, they say they are hopeful that they can find a comfortable space between two sometimes seemingly competing ideas: making gains for their separate constituencies while advancing toward a shared higher ground.

HEADLINE: Judge Takes On the White House on Mountaintop Mining 

BYLINE:  By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: LEWISBURG, W.Va., May 16 

 BODY:
The towering strip mining machines that have been systematically decapitating mountains in Appalachia have once again run up against a flinty federal judge convinced that government agencies illegally allow the coal industry to pollute and obliterate the region's vital waterways with millions of tons of waste.
 In a direct challenge to the Bush administration, the judge, Chief Judge Charles H. Haden II of the Southern District of West Virginia, found last week that the administration's new rule change that allows the dumping of mining rock and dirt into the streams and valleys of Appalachia is an "obvious perversity" of the Clean Water Act. 
 "The rule change was designed simply for the benefit of the mining industry and its employees," Judge Haden ruled. He ordered the Army Corps of Engineers to stop issuing permits to companies that have been dumping millions of tons of waste into hundreds of miles of waterways and hollows in the mining practice known as mountaintop removal. 
This is the process of blasting away mountaintop rock to reach low-sulphur coal veins with mammoth bulldozers and drag lines. The practice pours waste down into the mountain hollows, where residents have been increasingly displaced or bought out by the companies. 
Judge Haden's ruling has stunned the Appalachian coal industry, which warns that the decision could, in theory, shut down any mine in the nation that dumps waste into water. But it has cheered environmental groups that have been contending that the Bush administration, mindful of three critical electoral votes Republicans won here in the close 2000 presidential election, has rewarded the coal industry with job appointments and policy accommodations.
The administration, insisting its new rule on mining waste protects the environment, warned this week that the court ruling will mean "severe economic and social hardship for the region," with tens of thousands of jobs at risk along with hundreds of millions in state revenue and profits in related industries.
"Mining companies will almost certainly suspend future mining projects in the Appalachian region, lay off existing workers and abandon plans for hiring new ones," Glenda E. Owens, deputy director of the United States Department of Interior for surface mining, cautioned this week in urging Judge Haden to stay his order pending an appeal. The judge is not expected to rule on the stay until next month. 
"That's a red herring," said Joe Lovett, director of the Appalachian Center for the Economy and the Environment, one of the litigants suing the corps of engineers. Mr. Lovett said the ruling, if upheld, would protect communities, streams and hardwood forests from destruction and encourage a more balanced economy in lumbering and better controlled underground and strip mining.
Judge Haden has been over this legal terrain before. In 1999, he ruled that state agencies had failed to enforce federal environmental protection laws affecting mountaintop removal. Under the process, hundreds of square miles of mountains have been leveled and dozens of communities have been bought out. 
Judge Haden's decision in that first suit was overturned on appeal a year ago. Without ruling on the merits of the complaint, a panel of the appeals court found that West Virginia had constitutional immunity against the lawsuit. It was filed by a resident who had held out against a buyout when his neighbors abandoned Pigeon Roost Hollow in Blair, W.Va., as waste descended. 
The new, broader lawsuit was filed against the federal government by community and environmental groups in a four-state coal region of Appalachia. Challenging a mine waste permit last year on the West Virginia-Kentucky border, the groups, operating as Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, charged that the Army Corps of Engineers illegally favored the coal industry by permitting destructive waste disposal in violation of corps regulations that specifically ban such dumping. 
Judge Haden agreed. The judge shocked the mining industry and environmentalists by reaching beyond the issue of existing regulations to strike down the Bush administration's new rule regarding the dumping of rock and dirt. 
He said the rule was an effort by federal agencies "to legalize their longstanding illegal regulatory practice." A change that basic, Judge Haden wrote, could only be tried "in the sunlight of open Congressional debate and resolution, not within the murk of administrative after-the-fact ratification of questionable regulatory practices."
Industry and government warn of economic ruin from the ruling, with 28,000 miners now at work in the $6.3 billion mining industry in West Virginia and Kentucky, mainly mountaintop removal. The mining industry insists it dumps fill only in seasonal streams, not those running year round, and notes that some companies invest in modified restoration of the shaved mountains.
The full damage from the stream dumping is only beginning to emerge, said Mr. Lovett and his co-counsel in the lawsuit, James M. Hecker of Trial Lawyers for Public Justice. They have used the Freedom of Information Act to obtain preliminary reports in a federally ordered consultant's study of environmental effects. Mr. Lovett said the consultants found that the mining industry would be more inconvenienced than devastated by proper application of the Clean Water Act.
Coal industry officials, with hundreds of waste applications pending, are counting on another victory on the appeals level to void Judge Haden's latest finding. 
In making his 1999 decision, the judge not only hiked to Pigeon Roost Hollow to view that site but also flew over the region's many mountaintop removal sites. 
"The sites stood out among the natural wooded ridges as huge white plateaus," he wrote, "and the valley fills appeared as massive, artificially landscaped stair steps. Tree growth was stunted or nonexistent. The mine sites appear stark and barren and enormously different from the original topography."
The judge wondered at all the absent wildlife that "can't be coaxed back." He concluded, "These harms cannot be undone."

HEADLINE: BASEBALL: INSIDE BASEBALL; 
Stunning About-Face For Scioscia's Angels

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
Managers were dropping to the right of him, they were falling to the left of him and Mike Scioscia was watching his team lose 14 of its first 20 games. He was surely another one on the endangered list.
 "I think when you take this position you're on the endangered list," said Scioscia, still the Anaheim Angels manager 20 games later, 17 of them Angels victories. 
 As far as General Manager Bill Stoneman was concerned, his manager had never been in danger of becoming his former manager.
When Stoneman was asked after those first 20 games whether he planned to fix anything, he said, "It's a little early for that." By what date might he do something? "We go day to day. If and when things become apparent, you seek to make a change here or there. We've got good talent. It just hasn't done it yet." 
It has now. The Angels have made such large strides in three weeks that they can actually see the Seattle Mariners ahead of them in the standing. Anaheim reeled off eight consecutive victories, then another eight in a row before losing last night, 10-4, in Chicago. No other team in the major leagues has had two winning streaks of eight games or more.
"It's been almost two different teams," Scioscia said. "The first 20 games we were short-handed."
He cited the early-season suspensions of first baseman Scott Spiezio and third baseman Troy Glaus for a spring-training brawl and injuries to closer Troy Percival, center fielder Darin Erstad, catcher Shawn Wooten and infielder Benji Gil.
"When your closer's out of his role, you don't realize how it affects your bullpen," Scioscia said. "It really had an impact on us. Besides that, we were playing poor baseball." Then they started playing better baseball and got healthy.
"These guys turned it around," he said. "I don't know if you can point to one thing. Seven, eight guys were struggling at the plate in the first 20 games. In the last three weeks seven, eight guys have been swinging the bats very well. We've certainly seen this team start to reach its potential."
The Angels' comeback has included two notable developments, one individual, one collective. 
When the Angels were only two games into what would be an eight-game winning streak, David Eckstein helped make it three by hitting the first grand slam of his career. The next day he extended it to four by slugging his second grand slam in the 14th inning against Toronto.
"Eck does so much for this club," Scioscia said of his 5-foot-8 shortstop. "The two grand slams were a surprise to all of us. But it's been more than one guy to fuel this stretch. And it's going to take more than one guy to keep it going."
The Angels have demonstrated explosive power, erupting for a 21-2 victory over Cleveland in their first long winning streak and a 19-0 romp over the White Sox in the second.
Entering yesterday's games, Glaus was second in the American League in runs batted in and tied for third in runs scored; Garret Anderson was among the leaders in total bases, extra-base hits and doubles, and Eckstein was sixth in hitting with runners in scoring position.
The pitching staff, with the league's third-lowest earned run average, 3.85, joined the Red Sox and the Yankees as the only teams under 4.00. Ramone Ortiz (2.63) and Kevin Appier (2.79) had the fourth- and sixth-best E.R.A.'s in the league. Appier (4-1) and Aaron Sele (4-2) have served the reinforcement role they were obtained to fill.
"Last year our pitching staff was a well-kept secret," Scioscia said. "Going into the end of August we were giving up the fewest runs in our league. We slipped in September, but we've improved from that. When you have two veterans like Appier and Sele come in, they have to help."
Along with the hitters, they have helped Scioscia stay in the dugout.

Starters Lifting Mets
The Mets' new, improved offense would be a disaster if it were not for the Mets' new starting pitchers. 
True, after adding Mo Vaughn, Roberto Alomar, Jeromy Burnitz and Roger Cedeno in highly visible, well chronicled off-season moves, the Mets have been shut out in fewer games (1) this season than they were in the same number of games last season (5). But taking their low run-production games over all, the Mets have had more than a year ago.
In their first 42 games last season, the Mets scored 3 or fewer runs in a game 22 times. In their first 42 games they scored 3 or fewer runs 25 times. They scored 3 or fewer runs in 10 of their last 13 games.
The Atlanta Braves also set out to bolster their offense. Their early results? In their first 43 games, they scored three or fewer runs 21 times compared with 24 times last season.
A key to the Braves' plans to improve their offense was their acquisition of Gary Sheffield from Los Angeles. What has Sheffield's absence meant for the Dodgers? In their first 42 games last season, the Dodgers were shut out four times and scored three or fewer runs 19 times. In this season's first 42 games, they were shut out eight times and scored three or fewer runs 23 times.

Canseco Rejected Expos
Jose Canseco, who announced his retirement last week, said baseball blackballed him. His claim rings hollow. The Montreal Expos had him in spring training and were prepared to employ him, but he rejected their advances on two levels.
"I've seen no evidence of his being blackballed," Omar Minaya, the Expos' general manager, said. "When I decided to sign him, no one told me not to sign him. When he was in camp, he told us if he did not play every day he could not help the team. We asked him about playing in a platoon situation, and he said he couldn't help the team in that situation. We said we wanted him to go to Triple A and play every day and see what happens. He chose not to go. He said if he wasn't going to be on the major league club, he wanted his release."
So the Expos released him. They did not blackball him.

A Season of Streaks
This has been a streaky season, a very streaky season. Each league has had 10 winning streaks of six games or more. Last season at this time the American had six such streaks, the National two. Losing streaks, too, are up. The A.L. has had nine losing streaks of six or more games, the N.L. six. Last season the A.L. had seven such streaks, the N.L. five. 
The Cleveland Indians are the only A.L. team on the list of long winning streaks and long losing streaks. As they were winning 10 in a row in the first 12 games of the season, their general manager, Mark Shapiro, was delighted but also cautious.
"Talk to me after 40 games," he said.
Shapiro missed the Indians' 40th game Friday night, to attend his brother's wedding this weekend. But he had reason to be cautious during the team's good start. After their 10-game winning streak, the Indians lost six in a row twice and 20 of 28 games over all.

Strike Plan is Routine
There was a whole lot of overreaction last week to a routine development. The players are playing without a collective bargaining agreement, they are in a negotiating year and they face the prospect of unilateral action by the owners next November in establishing a new economic system.
So union officials began considering their options. One of those, the most severe option and therefore the least desirable, is to set a strike date. Talking about and setting a strike date in a negotiation year is as routine as sending out scouts in September to follow teams you might play in the playoffs if you make the playoffs.
All the union did was begin talking internally. Officials did not hold a news conference to announce the decision to begin talking about a possible strike date. They did not send out news releases or take out full-page newspaper advertisements. By the nature of their talks -- with player representatives and agents -- word of their preliminary discussion escaped the office walls.
Management immediately made public relations points at the union's expense, but the owners routinely make their own contingency plans. When they bought strike insurance in 1980, they did not disclose it and when it became known, it looked suspicious to fans. But it was a step the owners felt was necessary in their strategic planning. 
The players may very well strike later this year -- August would seem the most likely time -- but circumstances then, not talking about setting a date now, would prompt them to walk out.

 BARONESS ELSA
Gender, Dada, and Everyday Modernity:
A Cultural Biography.
By Irene Gammel.
Illustrated. 534 pp. Cambridge, Mass.:
The MIT Press. $39.95.
 The Baroness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven (1874-1927) -- known to her amused, admiring, often quailing friends simply as the Baroness -- was a public event, a proto-Happening. She painted her shaved head red. She wore a tomato-can bra, a bustle with a taillight and a bird cage around her neck with live canaries inside. The streets of New York were her theater. Dada was the name of her act. 
Many people who watched her clanking imperiously through Greenwich Village in the years just after World War I probably took her for only another New York nut job; until recently, history has done that too. But she was also an artist, a poet, a voluble fixture of the cultural avant-garde and a guerrilla fighter in sexual politics. This is how she comes across in Irene Gammel's "Baroness Elsa," the first full account of the Baroness's life. It attempts, on the whole persuasively, to position her as a catalytic figure in the American art of her day and in the evolution of certain more contemporary forms -- junk art, performance art, body art.
Despite her title, the Baroness was no blue-blood. Born Else Hildegard Plotz in a German resort town on the Baltic, she was the child of a bullying middle-class father and a mother who died insane. In her teens she high-tailed it to Berlin, where she worked as a chorus girl and lived off the kindness or perversity of various men and women, setting the pattern for a picaresque, pickup life. She must have been an experience. Tall, slender and boyishly handsome, with an explosive intelligence and assertive presence, she made sexual gratification an evangelical pursuit. After moving to Munich, she became immersed in the vanguard art world, the only environment in which she ever felt at home. It provided her with work (modeling), sex (all sorts) and two of her three marriages, the first to the architect August Endell, the second to the writer Felix Paul Greve.
Greve, who was gay when she met him, was a slippery character. In 1909, to escape debts, he faked suicide and left for America. Elsa followed later. He deserted her in Sparta, Ky., and headed for Canada, where he became Frederick Philip Grove, a novelist and a family-values man. Elsa made her way to Manhattan and within a year married an expatriate German baron, Leopold von Freytag-Loringhoven, who in 1914 sailed to Europe to fight in the war and took his own life a few years later, leaving her only his name.
Elsa came into her own as part of the New York Dada scene. Her sexual fieldwork continued, with many successes and a few notable disappointments. She developed a crush on Marcel Duchamp, who responded with passive evasion. ("Marcel, Marcel, I love you like hell, Marcel" was her cri de coeur.) William Carlos Williams initiated a casual flirtation only to learn that she was not a casual person. She ambushed him at his home in Rutherford, N.J.; he retaliated by decking her on a Manhattan street.
She started to make art: painted portraits, witty, delicate sculptures of found materials and assemblage-style costumes. Her beyond-the-fringe daring was a power of example for her male colleagues -- the wannabe Dadaist Ezra Pound spoke approvingly of her "principle of nonacquiescence" -- and may have produced collaborative results. Ms. Gammel presents strong evidence that the Baroness supplied Duchamp with the urinal from which his ground-breaking "Fountain" was made, and provided the prototype for his cross-dressed Rrose Selavy.
If her contributions to art went unacknowledged, she was recognized for her poetry -- thanks to other women. Margaret Anderson and Jane Heap, editors of The Little Review, published her experimental work, which mixed personal statement, fractured syntax and phonetic sounds. Djuna Barnes, a devoted fan, commissioned Elsa to write a memoir, which she planned to use as raw material for a biography. 
None of this helped Elsa in a material way. She was too naive to take care of herself economically. What little money she had she spent on stray animals she took into her claptrap apartments. In her mid-40's, she already looked derelict. And she was very difficult. She was anti-Semitic and homophobic, despite her Jewish friends and her own bisexuality. She became implacable in her demands for support and attention. A few people, like Barnes, Heap and the photographer Berenice Abbott, stuck by her more or less to the end, though at an increasing, self-protective distance.
The end was sad. In 1923, the Baroness decided to return to Europe. After relinquishing her Greenwich Village apartment, she spent her last month in New York camping out in Upper Manhattan parks. She arrived in Berlin to learn her father had died and disinherited her. Destitute, she sold newspapers on the Kurfurstendamm. She thought Paris might be the solution, but couldn't get a visa. Turning up for an interview at the French Consulate in Berlin with a birthday cake on her head -- to demonstrate that she was an artist, a universal citizen -- didn't help. She finally got to Paris in 1926, but nothing happened for her there. She had been too poor and too tired for too long. She died in her flat, asphyxiated by gas left on, deliberately or accidentally, by herself or someone else. Barnes claimed the body, but later forgot where her friend was buried, or if she had been buried at all. 
The Baroness could not have asked for a more thoughtful and engaged monument than Gammel's book. Stylistically, it's a bit flat-footed. As the title suggests, this is an interpretive biography, filtering a life through late-20th-century feminism and gender studies, making no attempt to streamline its theoretical mechanics.
What carries the day is the fact that Gammel, a professor of English at the University of Prince Edward Island in Canada, is clearly for her subject. All the Baroness's faults and absurdities are noted in detail, but so is her role as a pathfinder in transgressive sexuality, and as an artist. Here, Elsa is both exemplary and cautionary, valiant and pitiable, a pioneer and a victim, bigger than life but unprotected from life. 
When Barnes was struggling in the 1930's to write her biography of the Baroness -- she never finished it -- a friend advised her to think of Elsa "in as detached a way as you possibly can -- not as a saint or a madwoman, but as a woman of genius, alone in the world, frantic." Gammel has taken that advice to heart, and a dense, passionate book has come from it.

HEADLINE: THE RIGHT THING; 
In Bad Times, It's Easier to Blame

BYLINE:  By JEFFREY L. SEGLIN; Jeffrey L. Seglin teaches at Emerson College in Boston and is the author of "The Good, the Bad, and Your Business" (John Wiley & Sons). His column on business ethics appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: righthng@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IN "The Grapes of Wrath," John Steinbeck paints the scene of a farmer, carrying a shotgun, approaching the driver of a tractor that is demolishing his home. After the driver explains that a bank in Oklahoma City has instructed him to do the deed, the farmer exclaims in frustration, "Who can we shoot?"
 When things go wrong, our natural tendency is to find someone to blame. 
 Certainly, when corporations engage in fraud and deliberately deceive the public and the government, they deserve all the blame we care to heap upon them. But during the blame-heaping, we shouldn't let dissatisfaction with the way our own personal fortunes have devolved make us lose sight of who is really responsible for what. 
If it turns out that Enron and Arthur Andersen were engaged in fraudulent accounting practices, then, ethically, we have a responsibility to hold them accountable. Similarly, if it turns out that stock analysts at Merrill Lynch let their business relationships affect how they rated stocks, then they should be held accountable as well. Indeed, Eliot L. Spitzer, the attorney general of New York, would have us believe that examples he culled from thousands of subpoenaed e-mail records from Merrill Lynch are the smoking gun proving that the company's Internet analysts were deliberately touting stocks they thought were bad investments.
Timothy I. Cobb, Merrill Lynch's global head of media relations, said the e-mail messages "don't make us guilty."
"It was just banter between colleagues, as you would around the water cooler," he said.
Perhaps it's time for employees at brokerage houses to recognize that idle chatter suggesting contempt for investors and the companies they analyze might be overlooked when economic conditions are heady, but when the economy turns sour, such language makes for an easy target for blame.
"When stocks go up, there's very little complaining," said James Wiggins, head of corporate communications for Merrill Lynch and Mr. Cobb's boss. But when the economy goes bad, the complaining starts. "It's human nature," Mr. Wiggins said.
Laura P. Hartman, a professor of business ethics at DePaul University in Chicago and editor of "Perspectives in Business Ethics" (McGraw-Hill, 2001), agrees. "Our desire to praise is never as strong as our desire to blame," she said. "Blame is a natural, self-protecting tendency. Is it fair to blame Merrill Lynch, or do you play a responsibility in this? Given ourselves or someone else, we're far more likely to blame other people."
David H. Komansky, chief executive of Merrill Lynch, told shareholders at their annual meeting last month that the company believes "strongly in the integrity" of its research. He said the e-mail messages "that have come to light are very distressing and disappointing to us; they fall far short of our professional standards." Some investors have been skeptical of his comments, because they were made only after Mr. Spitzer's office disclosed the contents of some subpoenaed messages. 
Ethics come into play in thinking through the fairness of our judgments. "All of us were happy to see our stock portfolios soar in value and did not want to look too closely at the practices that were generating our capital gains," said Daryl Koehn, director of the Center for Business Ethics at the University of St. Thomas in Houston. "When the market went south, we all looked for someone to scapegoat, instead of examining our own behavior. But I think more is going on here. 
"Accountants will argue that more abuses occur during good times," she said, because companies may not be as vigorous in following the processes they had established to ensure ethical behavior.
Similarly, when economic opportunities appear to abound, she said, people are often willing to turn a blind eye to ethically questionable practices.
It is no surprise that when Americans are asked about their view of Wall Street, they are most approving when times are good. Thirteen percent said they had a great deal of confidence in Wall Street in 1995, while 18 percent said so in 1998, as the bull market continued. The figure spiked to 30 percent in 1999, in the headiest days of the dot-com rush, only to drop to 19 percent this year, according to annual surveys from the Harris Poll. Success, it seems, breeds confidence, ethics aside.
If placing blame is natural, then what is the lesson here? Perhaps it is that before we start firing away at the largest target in site, we first examine how much personal responsibility we have in what went wrong and learn to hold businesses accountable in both strong and lean economic times. Then we should figure out ways to ensure that these fine messes don't happen again.

HEADLINE: Rightist's Hard Line Appeals to War-Weary Colombians 

BYLINE:  By JUAN FORERO 

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, May 18 

 BODY:
He has already survived one assassination attempt this year, so Alvaro Uribe's run for the presidency has been especially cautious, even in this war-ravaged country. Public appearances have been minimal, mainly teleconferences with select audiences or low-key meetings with small groups of businessmen, all confined to this capital city.
 It is not an ideal way to campaign. 
 But Mr. Uribe, an ultraconservative candidate whose promise to crack down on leftist rebels has resonated with a conflict-weary populace, still holds a commanding lead in the polls with a week to go before an election that is being closely watched in Washington. Indeed, Mr. Uribe, a lawyer and expert horseman from northern Colombia, is expected to receive nearly 50 percent of the vote in next Sunday's election, 20 percentage points more than his nearest rival, Horacio Serpa, and nearly the majority needed to avoid a June 16 runoff. 
But while Mr. Uribe will almost surely become the next president, what is less certain is what effects his policies would have on this country and what they would mean for the United States, which has provided nearly $2 billion in mostly military aid since 2000.
What Mr. Uribe, 49, a former governor and senator from Antioquia province province who has completed courses at Harvard and Oxford, prescribes is a break from the policies of the current president, Andres Pastrana. Mr. Pastrana, whose peace talks with rebels of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, collapsed earlier this year, is barred under the Constitution from seeking re-election.
Pledging to become "the first soldier of Colombia" in a campaign against leftist rebels, Mr. Uribe promises to double the size of the army's combat force and the police and to organize one million villagers to serve as informants, some of them armed. He also has cast himself as a corruption fighter who will free up government funds for his programs.
"We are going to work hard to strengthen the capacity of the state to protect the citizenry and control the violent ones," Mr. Uribe said recently, as his heavily protected motorcade sped from a campaign event. "This is a country that has suffered very much from violence and kidnapping and we are going to put a stop to this problem."
The United States, he said, will play a central role because Colombia is counting on military hardware and training so Colombian troops can better fight the rebels. Currently American aid can only go toward operations to counter drugs, but the Bush administration is pressing Congress to allow American-trained soldiers and equipment to be used directly against the guerrillas. 
Mr. Uribe, some American lawmakers believe, is the appropriate caretaker for that policy. "We feel that he would be an action-type president," said Representative Cass Ballenger, a North Carolina Republican on the International Relations Committee. "I think President Pastrana was a heck of a nice guy. He dedicated himself to making peace, but they took advantage of him. I don't think Uribe is that kind of guy."
Indeed, Mr. Uribe -- whose campaign slogan is "firm hand, big heart" -- is seen as a leader tailor-made for this chaotic country. The rebels, clearly feeling threatened, carried out a street bombing on April 14 that damaged Mr. Uribe's passing motorcade, killing four bystanders but leaving him unscathed.
Mr. Uribe's lead in the polls is a testament to Colombian fatigue with a grinding 38-year conflict.
Voters seem to be overlooking the fact that Mr. Uribe is an independent candidate representing the far right in a centrist country where only Liberal or Conservative party politicians have won national office. Mr. Uribe and his Colombia First movement have the support of 55 of 102 senators and 97 of 165 representatives, according to a survey of Colombia's Congress by the University of Los Andes.
Mr. Uribe has mined Colombian frustration for months, criticizing Mr. Pastrana's peace efforts and harshly denouncing the FARC rebels for practically every atrocity, like the May 2 rebel rocket attack on a church that killed 117 civilians. His own personal loss in the conflict -- his father was slain by the guerrillas in 1983 -- has also struck a chord.
"This is the first time we Colombians feel there is someone who is going to give us back what is ours," said Luis Guillermo Henao, 40, a civil engineer who plans to vote for Mr. Uribe. "Uribe is the response to the crisis."
But Mr. Uribe's ability to deliver on his promises will not be easy. 
His scheme to add 50,000 combat troops to the 55,000 the army already has, along with doubling the size of the National Police to 200,000 officers, could cost up to $1 billion a year -- a heavy increase in a country with an annual budget of $27 billion.
"Aside from that business over reducing corruption, the president nearly-elect has not said from where the money will come," Hernando Gomez Buendia, a leading columnist at Semana magazine, wrote last week.
Mr. Uribe has also worried human rights groups, who believe that his policies may come at a steep price for Colombia's fragile democracy.
During his governorship of Antioquia from 1995 to 1997, illegal right-wing paramilitary groups thrived, working with some military units in their brutal campaign against guerrillas. Two generals in the region -- Rito Alejo del Rio and Fernando Millan -- were fired by President Pastrana for rights abuses, and Mr. del Rio's visa to travel to the United States was canceled.
Yet, Mr. Uribe continues to support Mr. del Rio, having used him as an adviser on military matters even though the former general is under investigation in Colombia. In a meeting late last year with Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of operations in Latin America for Human Rights Watch, Mr. Uribe also expressed disagreement with Mr. Pastrana's decision to force out other high-ranking officers who were believed to have ties to the paramilitaries.
While Mr. Uribe has incorporated into his speeches the need to battle paramilitaries, Mr. Vivanco said he has doubts about his sincerity. "The question is," Mr. Vivanco said, "can he convince Colombia and the international community that he is committed to fighting right-wing paramilitary groups?"
Mr. Uribe has also faced questions about his past associations. His father was friendly with Fabio Ochoa, the now-deceased father of three brothers who were among Colombia's most fearsome drug traffickers a decade ago. His closest aide during his governorship of Antioquia was Pedro Juan Moreno, who was investigated by United States officials because his company had imported into Colombia a suspicious shipment of chemicals that could have been used for cocaine production. 
The candidate said there was nothing inappropriate about these relationships, noting that Mr. Moreno was never charged and that his father's friendship with the elder Ochoa was based on mutual love of horses. "For 30 years," he said, "I have simply been an honest politician."
Mr. Uribe -- to most voters viewed as transparent, bookish and earnest about solving Colombia's myriad problems -- hammers home the need to end corruption and reform government, saying that the money saved would allow for the construction of schools and improvement of government services. 
"The candidacy of Alvaro Uribe has generated enormous expectations," said Elisabeth Ungar, a political scholar at Los Andes. "I just think it is going to be very difficult to reach those heights, not just because of resources -- everyone knows the country's difficult situation -- but also because of the political situation."

The Billionaires' Boat Maker

BYLINE:  By JAMES V. O'CONNOR 

DATELINE: MAMARONECK 

 BODY:
TUCKED in among the diners and seafood restaurants on the Boston Post Road in this town on the Long Island Sound, a shipbuilder makes 150-foot custom sailing yachts for billionaire clients from all over the world.
 Derecktor Shipyards makes sailboats, powerboats and high-speed ferries ranging in size from 75 to 150 feet long. Since 1947, when the shipyard opened, the specialty here has been aluminum-hulled crafts. Derecktor built the first aluminum yacht in the United States; it is the only company in the country building aluminum yachts bigger than 100 feet. 
 Ship building and repair was a small but vibrant industry in the area before World War II. Now Derecktor is one of the last ship builders in Westchester and despite the sagging economy, it is doing so well that it is outgrowing its current space, and moving some of its operations to Bridgeport, Conn. 
"There was a lot of money floating around in the 90's and we are an ultimate high-end product," said Gavin Higgins, the company's chief operating officer. "But it takes a long time to build boats like we do. We are building one right now that will take 30 months." The stock-market downturn had a minor effect on powerboat orders but orders for sail boats and ferries have always remained steady, said Mr. Higgins. Sailing yachts can cost from $1 million to $5 million. Motor yachts can cost as much as $15 million. 
Orders for more and bigger boats are outpacing Derecktor's space at the yard here. The company is building two to three new boats and servicing 15 boats of various sizes each year. With its physical plant stretched to capacity, the company built a new yard in Bridgeport that is about 10 times the size of the 60,000-square-foot yard in Mamaroneck. "There are space constraints in Mamaroneck so the Connecticut yard will become the primary assembly yard and Mamaroneck will be used primarily as a service yard," said Krista Stanley, director of planning and communication. "The joinery work will still be done in Mamaroneck." 
Moving boats during construction is almost impossible in Mamaroneck because the yard isn't equipped with a travel lift. Workers use a 120-ton stationary derrick, which looks like a huge crane. The space constraints and congested location on Boston Post Road make it impossible to pull a tractor-trailer into the yard to upload whole boats or hulls. One of the yard's customers, Larry Ellison, the founder and chief executive officer of Oracle Corporation, transports his 84-foot sailboat from the Long Island Sound to Chicago to race on the Great Lakes every year. The mast and the keel have to be removed from the boat in the yard and hoisted by the derrick over the warehouse and fence and into the parking lot of the diner next door, where it is loaded on a tractor-trailer. 
Most of the new construction work that will be done in Mamaroneck will be the cabinetry and woodworking that go into yachts' interiors. Every yacht that Derecktor builds is one of a kind. There are no patterns, templates or standard parts to be used. Building a 100-foot yacht takes two to three years and entails hundreds of thousands of hours of work.
"Most owners have a vague idea of what they want when they decide to build a yacht," said Gilbert Mello, the company's production manager, who has been building yachts for 30 years. "So we build them a three-dimensional wooden mock-up on a one-to-one scale so they can see what it will look like in the interior and how everything will fit."
Mr. Mello travels the world to select the woods that will go into the interiors: teak from Singapore, spruce from Seattle. The challenge in ship joinery, said Mr. Mello, is that everything has to be square and plumb as in building a house but it also has to be attached to a curved hull. All of the woodwork has to be hollowed out and filled with foam to keep the boat light. "When you build a house, a kitchen is a kitchen, but yachts are all different and are much more challenging," he said.
Zingaro, which means gipsy in Italian, a 112-foot sloop, was a recent Derecktor project, built for a South American client. The boat can travel 13 knots under 5,000 square feet of sail. It has two cabins for a crew of four, guest cabins for four and a captain's cabin with a queen-sized bed. Teak paneling lines the interior, 17th-century Italian seascapes hang on the walls, and a plasma screen television and treadmill await use. Space was a major factor in the decision to build the Bridgeport yard, but the work force was also an issue. "Being located in Westchester is a problem because it is expensive to live here and it is hard to attract good workers," Mr. Mello said. "Very few of the guys that work here live here."
A high cost of living means an expensive labor force, which explains the absence of shipbuilding in the area. The United States has the same problem when trying to compete with foreign shipbuilders. Asian shipbuilders have much lower labor costs, but shipyards that build ferries are protected under the Jones Act. The law was enacted in 1920 to ensure that the country had a shipbuilding and ship repair industrial base in place to respond in the event of a war. It requires that all vessels used for commerce on domestic waterways be built in the United States, protecting shipbuilders like Derecktor from foreign competition.
Derecktor has built high-speed ferries and has supplied boats for most of the ferry lines servicing the waterways around New York. Two will be servicing the route between Atlantic Highlands, N.J., to Lower Manhattan, and a 65-foot cargo ferry for Fire Island and two more ferries for use in Alaska are in the works. 
Aluminum hulls, which are light and very strong, worked well for yachts and high-speed ferries, said Mr. Higgins. The aluminum design enables the boat to take lots of stress, pounding and use. Its light weight enables higher speeds of up to 45 miles per hour and creates a shallow draft allowing the boat to navigate shallow water carrying up to 1,000 passengers. 
There are structural similarities between ferries and yachts, which made the production an easy switch. The clients are completely different, however. Ferry operators put out a request for a proposal and the contract is awarded to the lowest bidder. "Commercial operators want a boat that runs so fast and carries so many people in these particular conditions and seasons," said Mr. Higgins. "The look of the boat is usually not a requirement; they leave that up to the shipyard." 
On the yacht side, the customer will go to a naval architect first; the way the boat looks is very important. Sailboats are usually built for customers who have sailed their whole lives and have a passion for sailing. Powerboats are for people who want lots of staterooms inside.
"You can get a lot of state rooms in a powerboat that you can't in a sailboat because they have the nasty habit of being pointy at both ends," said Mr. Higgins. "Powerboat buyers are looking for a floating condo that they can park in Florida in the winter and Nantucket in the summer."

A Little Tax-Free Shopping? Some Smiles, A Few Shrugs

BYLINE:  By DENNY LEE 

 BODY:
For shoppers who need an excuse, state and city lawmakers hope to make spending money a bit more guilt free.
 Under the budget passed in Albany last week, the state's portion of the city's 8.25 percent sales tax (about half) will be suspended below Houston Street during three 3-day periods in the next three months. The City Council supports doing the same with the city's half of the sales tax, but Mayor Bloomberg remains uncommitted. 
 The tax-free days, which are expected to cost the city and state (and save consumers) $20 million total, would apply to all retail items sold in Lower Manhattan that cost less than $500, except for tobacco and alcohol. 
On the streets, reaction ranged from smiles to shrugs. Typical of the latter was Nelly Lanti, a legal secretary who works downtown. "If I had to buy something," she said, "I don't think about the tax."
The proposal, introduced by Sheldon Silver, the state assembly speaker, initially faced some opposition. The State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, wanted the tax-free zone to begin farther south, at Chambers Street. But Mr. Silver, who represents the Lower East Side, insisted that the border be expanded north to Houston Street to include an area he has dubbed "the Lower Manhattan resurgence zone." 
"You have to cast a slightly broader net," said Dan Weiller, a spokesman for Mr. Silver. "The speaker felt really strongly that all businesses in the resurgence zone had suffered."
In the end, Mr. Silver prevailed and the $89.6 billion state budget hammered out last Thursday will cover all retail businesses south of Houston Street on June 9 to 11, July 9 to 11 and Aug. 20 to 22. 
But the fate of the city's 4 portion of the sales tax is tied up in budget negotiations. A spokesman for Mr. Bloomberg said Friday that the mayor had concerns about the effect the proposed tax break would have on the city's hefty budget deficit. 
While much of Lower Manhattan has bounced back economically, business groups there say that the retail sector remains sluggish. 
In Chinatown, jewelry stores were among the hardest hit, with workers reporting an 80 percent decline in wages, according to a recent report. 
In TriBeCa, restaurants like Chanterelle have largely rebounded, but many mom-and-pop shops are having trouble meeting their rent. "Those businesses are way down," said Julia Pershan, chairwoman of the TriBeCa Organization, a neighborhood assistance group formed after Sept. 11. "This would be a great kick in the pants."

HEADLINE: Pushing the Limit 

 BODY:
Congress, which was all ears when George W. Bush wanted to cut taxes, has turned hard of hearing now that the president needs to raise the legal limit on the national debt. Virtually everybody agrees that the debt level will have to go up soon by $750 billion, to $6.7 trillion. But Congress is understandably reluctant to go on record as admitting that its most significant achievement during the Bush presidency has been to plunge the nation deeper into hock. If our elected officials cannot properly manage the country's finances, the least they can do is face the music like adults. 
 Republicans are worried that if they vote to raise the debt limit, their Democratic opponents in November will claim that the tax cuts for the wealthy they passed last year, along with the economic downturn, have drained away both the budget surplus and the money that was intended to be stored away -- in that famous locked box -- to shore up the Social Security system. 
 The chances of that happening are excellent since the scenario is absolutely true. The only problem for the Democrats will be explaining away the votes some of their members produced in the Senate to help put the whole sorry tax package into law.
State legislatures all over the country are currently reeling because they followed Congress's lead and cut taxes in boom times to a level that could never be sustained when recession kicked in. The economic slowdown America suffered turned out to be relatively mild, but virtually every state in the union is wrestling with a budget crisis that can be traced to big tax cuts in the 1990's. Like Congress, none of the state legislatures are prepared to do the things necessary to make the books balance. So they are engaged in a wild dance with budget mirrors and accounting tricks -- the favorite idea seems to be spending the next 30 years' worth of revenue from the tobacco settlements tomorrow.
Fiscal conservatives are fond of comparing the government to a family that must cut expenses in tough times. But when they are preparing to eliminate government revenue, they never seem to ask themselves how many families would encourage mom to quit her job without estimating whether the loss of income could be afforded.
And the theory that tax cuts can be used to force the government to shrink never seems to quite work out in the real world. In the 1980's, Congress found it easy as pie to deliver the Reagan tax cuts, but impossible to produce the budget reductions that were supposed to go along with them. The size of government continued to grow apace during Ronald Reagan's tenure, as did the budget deficits, with all the strain on the private economy that huge federal borrowing always entails.
This year, the orgy of pandering to special interest groups that produced an obscene $190 billion farm bill is still not over, and the administration is finding it hard to achieve its one significant plan to eliminate useless defense spending: cancellation of the Crusader artillery system.
Having failed to be sensible when it comes to tax cuts, or disciplined when it comes to budgets, or responsible when it comes to setting a good example for the states, Congress can at least be realistic. Raise the debt limit and admit defeat.

An Empire Tries to Become a Normal Nation

BYLINE:  By CELESTINE BOHLEN 

 BODY:
PRESIDENT BUSH told Russia's foreign minister he is preparing for his first trip to Russia by reading the works of Fyodor Dostoyevsky, the 19th-century author whose works explored the dark recesses of the Russian soul.
 But Mr. Bush has picked the wrong author, Russians say, because the Russia he will be visiting this week is not the Russia of Dostoyevsky, with mystical saints and guilt-stricken madmen, but a more rational and forward-looking nation that is being pushed, prodded and promoted by his host, President Vladimir V. Putin. 
 "Bush is reading Dostoyevsky, but he should be reading Nabokov, because that is where the future is, not the past," said Nina L. Khrushcheva, a professor in international affairs at the New School University.
Like Dostoyevsky, Mr. Putin is a nationalist. But like Vladimir Nabokov, the emigre writer, Mr. Putin also seems to have a clear understanding of what Russia lacks, and of what the West has to offer. 
In his two years in office, most particularly since Sept. 11, this former K.G.B. agent has set Russia's course westward -- economically, culturally, politically and now strategically, through a bilateral arms control agreement with the United States and a new alliance with NATO that gives Russia a seat at Europe's head table.
Still, the gap separating Russia and the West, while narrowing, remains wide -- and can be measured in many ways, not just by economic statistics that show Russia lagging significantly behind even Poland, let alone Germany, France or the United States.
So is this the historical moment that has beckoned for decades, even centuries, the moment when Russia becomes a member of the club of civilized countries? Can it be that Russia -- so vast it sprawls across 10 time zones and two continents -- is ready to check its baggage at the door, its history of exotic, often brutal despotism, its messianic ambitions and its belief in its own special destiny?
WESTERN leaders last week were quick to pronounce the end of one era, and the opening of a new one. Jack Straw, the British foreign secretary, said that the new Russian-NATO council amounted to a "funeral of the cold war," and others spoke effusively about Russia's long awaited integration into Europe.
But to many Russians, these pronouncements seemed both short-sighted and outdated. On one hand, they say, the cold war ended more than a decade ago, with the political reforms begun by Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, which led to the fall of the Berlin Wall and then of the Soviet Union itself.
"I am sick and tired of attending funerals for the cold war," said Vyacheslav Nikonov, head of the Politika Foundation, a research group. "Gorbachev ended the cold war in 1989. It died then, and I think it is still dead."
On the other hand, Russia has proved resistant to change in the past at least as far back as Peter the Great, who in the 17th and 18th centuries tried to modernize and Westernize his country. Even the communist revolution of 1917, many argue, only perpetuated a traditional despotism with an imperialist foreign policy, even if clothed in the language of Marx and Lenin. 
"The process has begun," was a phrase used by Mr. Gorbachev in those years (in Russian, the phrase is more vivid, suggesting a train that has left the station). But from the Russian perspective, that process is far from over. 
RUSSIA is getting closer, and the West is letting it get closer," said Ms. Khrushcheva, a granddaughter of the Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. "But the process is not always linear, and that is not only Russia's doing. We have centuries of mistrust between us, and they cannot be overcome in 10, or 20 years. This is one chapter in a series of chapters, and all that we can say is that the chapters are getting shorter."
Otto Latsis, a political commentator at the newspaper Noviye Izvestia, also believes that Russia's rapprochement with the West still has a way to go. "I agree with the word historical," he said, referring to last week's headlines about Russia's new relationship with NATO, "but not with the word moment. This is the subject of an eternal debate that has been going on for hundreds of years. The adoption of the Western model for Russia is the key question behind our economic reforms, and it is the key to our political change. It can only be a process, a long and difficult one, with twists and turns."
Even if they couldn't quite comprehend it a decade ago, most Russians have now come to understand that the loss of their superpower status was the price they had to pay to become a "normal" country -- if by normal they meant free, democratic and market-oriented. And as painful as that can be sometimes, most Russians have made peace with their choice. 
Even before Sept. 11, Mr. Putin seemed ready to accept that reality and make the best of it, by choosing to cooperate with the West, rather than confront it. 
But he has done so in the face of resistance from much of Russia's institutional elite, from the military and the remnants of the old Soviet foreign policy establishment, many of whom still bridle at the concessions made by Mr. Gorbachev as the cold war was winding down.
"For Russia, it is difficult to become a minor partner," said Anatoli I. Utkin, director of international studies at the Institute for U.S. and Canadian Studies in Moscow. "Since 1480, with the defeat of the Mongols, Russia has never been in second place to anyone. It is difficult to imagine that Russia would ever be happy to be behind the leader, just one member of a pack."
And yet, as many argue, Russia really has no choice. The Soviet Union bankrupted itself by keeping its economy on a war footing for 60 years, Mr. Latsis said. "Now our economy is even worse off," he said. "So how could we conduct ourselves like a superpower? On the basis of what? I can believe that there are some people in the Pentagon who would like to destroy Russia, as they did the Soviet Union, but we should not take up their challenge."
MANY Russians still harbor deep misgivings about the West -- or rather about the West's intentions toward Russia. Those feelings are particularly strong among the elite, but then, as Mr. Nikonov said, here Mr. Putin benefits from the Russian tradition of a strong, even all-powerful leader.
"Russia is still a czarist country where the elite can be ignored," said Mr. Nikonov. 
In any case, he added, the general population has more positive feelings towards the West in general, and the United States in particular. Only twice in the last decade have those feelings soured significantly: once during the American-led bombing campaign in Yugoslavia in 1998, and again during the Salt Lake City Olympics, when Russians felt that their top figure-skaters were the victims of an anti-Russian hysteria generated in the North American press.
The vehemence of the Russian reaction to these events reflects, in part, a sensitivity over their country's weakened position. For many Russians, the bombs that fell on Serbia, a Russian client state, were an ominous hint that bombs could fall again on Russian targets, should Washington will it. At Salt Lake City, too, Russians felt powerless, voiceless and victimized.
So far, the larger strategic issues raised by Russia's new role at NATO, or the terms of the latest arms control agreement, seem barely to have registered on Russian public opinion. But that could change, some experts predict, as NATO takes on the Baltic states as members, or if the American military presence in Central Asia and in Georgia looks set to become long-term.
These issues -- and others, like a possible American invasion of Iraq -- could upset the delicate balance built into Russia's relations with the West, and could, some argue, even lead to Mr. Putin's eventual eclipse -- just as Mr. Gorbachev is thought to have dug his own political grave by being overly eager in his accommodation of the West.
"There is a feeling of deja vu," Mr. Utkin said. "For the second time, Russia is going bearing gifts." The question is whether this time, it will get enough in return to warrant staying the course.
Russia's democracy has advanced since Communist hard-liners mounted a coup against Mr. Gorbachev in 1991: Mr. Putin, unlike Mr. Gorbachev, was popularly elected, and today enjoys a popularity rating of 70 percent or more, about equal to Mr. Bush's. 
THESE things can change, however, and there is no guarantee -- either institutional or cultural -- that Russians next time won't swing away from Mr. Putin's pro-Western policies, leaving the next leader with the same broad powers to move in an entirely different direction.
"Essentially we are talking about two approaches," Mr. Utkin said. "One, taken from American folklore, is if you can't beat them, join them. The other path, which was taken by Winston Churchill or Charles de Gaulle, is to show defiance even in defeat." 
How would the second approach be put into effect? "This is a big country, a very patriotic country, and people could be made ready for mobilization," Mr. Utkin said.
In other words, the debate over Russia's role in the world and history is not over. Even as the Russian foreign minister Igor Ivanov was clasping hands with Western leaders at a NATO meeting in Reykjavik, Mr. Putin was playing host to five presidents of ex-Soviet Republics who came to Moscow to turn a 1992 military alliance into a formal organization.
"This is a kind of insurance policy," Mr. Utkin said, "a guarantee against being melted into the crowd, being put somewhere between Portugal and Spain."

HEADLINE: New Mining Laws, But Only if Fair 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "A Bad Law's Birthday" (editorial, May 13): The mining industry does, in fact, support mining law reform. We supported the 1995 bipartisan reforms, which resolved many issues raised by your editorial, but President Bill Clinton vetoed the bill. 
 The industry now complies with a range of federal and state environmental laws. The regulatory changes made by Bruce Babbitt when he was interior secretary represented an anti-economic-development agenda he knew Congress would never approve. The Bush administration's re-evaluation restores a semblance of balance between reasonable environmental protection and the country's economic objectives.
Instead of focusing on divisiveness, the coming Congressional debate should look at fair, meaningful reform. The industry will certainly do its part.

HEADLINE: THE BUSINESS WORLD; 
Mexico Embraces Microsoft, Stirring a Debate

BYLINE:  By GRAHAM GORI 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY 

 BODY:
WHEN he was 17, Miguel de Icaza wrote his first computer program on the supercomputers of Mexico's nuclear institute. In college, he developed Ximian Gnome, a desktop program that is a lot like Microsoft Windows but differs in one fundamental way. It is free.
 Today, at 29, he lives in Boston and is chief technology officer of Ximian Inc., whose software can be freely downloaded from the Internet and is used on millions of desktops worldwide. 
 When he learned that President Vicente Fox had announced a nationwide plan to make millions of Mexicans computer-literate, Mr. de Icaza saw a great opportunity to promote his software at home. But he has since found that Mexico is eager to develop its technology market only with companies that offer millions of dollars to take part. 
And that is how Microsoft, which up north has faced years of regulatory battles over what critics call its monopolistic practices, came to be handed what could fast become a monopoly here.
When Mr. Fox took office, in December 2000, he announced an ambitious project to bring nearly all of Mexico's 100 million people online, but he soon realized that his digital revolution was severely short of financing. Congress, in fact, did not give him one centavo for the first year of the project, called e-Mexico.
Mr. Fox's administration began asking for ideas, but most of all for cash. And international companies, led by Microsoft, have been racing to answer the call.
Mr. de Icaza was quick to offer his services. In January 2001, granted a few minutes with Mr. Fox at a social event, he asked the president to support open-source software instead of proprietary software, the kind Microsoft sells. He said that with the millions of dollars the government saved on licensing and upgrade fees, it could train and employ a generation of programmers to create a software industry to rival Microsoft.
When his time was up, Mr. de Icaza recalled Mr. Fox saying, "Thank you, but that's exactly what we're getting with Microsoft."
Last month Mr. de Icaza learned that Mr. Fox's government had signed a multimillion-dollar deal with Microsoft to train 23,000 computer technicians for the first round of community centers going online with e-Mexico.
Three more deals are on the way. The first of them will be a $56 million investment to help the commerce ministry train 23,000 professionals and schoolteachers. The second will give an estimated $10 million to train those running small and midsize businesses in using Microsoft Office software. And the third, a gift from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to Mr. Fox's philanthropy wing, Vamos Mexico, will bring the nation's 6,000 libraries online using Microsoft technology.
When all four deals are in place, Microsoft will have pledged more than $100 million to the Mexican government and trained more than 70,000 professionals and teachers.
Only 4 percent of Mexicans now have access to the Internet, but the number is expected to grow rapidly, placing Mexico in the middle of a global debate about how to develop its emerging technology market.
One camp, led by Mr. de Icaza, asserts that with open-source software, Mexico can avoid a debt burden to companies like Microsoft, while providing jobs to thousands of underemployed computer scientists. The other side contends that Microsoft offers a quick and efficient method to train millions of people.
With only a $65 million budget for e-Mexico this year, Mr. Fox's government decided that it could not complete the project on its own.
"We don't have the resources, and these communities need something to start with," said Julio Cesar Margain, director of e-Mexico. "Microsoft has been one of the tools to democratize knowledge in the computer era." When people become computer-literate, Mr. Margain said, they can decide whether open-source software is an option for them. But his job now is to help millions of Mexicans start using computers.
Technology analysts are divided about the merit of this decision.
James F. Moore, chairman of GeoPartners Ventures, a technology consulting firm in Boston, says open-source software can reduce the debt burdens of developing countries in the long term. But he also says commercial software can play a big role in a country like Mexico.
"If you're trying to get your people trained so they can get jobs with companies, then you really want them trained with Microsoft software," Mr. Moore said.
But analysts are concerned that Mr. Fox's government is too willing to cede control of e-Mexico and the nation's technology market to the company that is quickest to offer a multimillion-dollar package.
"It's a good deal for the country in the near term because it helps accelerate some things," said Michael Kleeman, a principal at Quintessence, an information technology consulting business, which is based in Washington. "But who did they make themselves hostage to?"
MR. KLEEMAN said that Mexico might be committing itself to Microsoft without first discussing the possibility of adopting open-source strategies, which are gaining steam elsewhere.
The defense ministry of Germany has switched to open-source software, primarily to reduce reliance on outside parties for running and maintaining sensitive computer systems. China has embraced similar technologies, for similar reasons and to avoid copyright fees. France, out of national pride, is discussing making its entire public school system open-source rather than relying on American software.
In South Africa, the Parliament passed a resolution that public schools must use open-source software, as did a few states in Brazil. Argentina and Peru have similar legislation pending.
But Mexico, for now, has chosen to align itself with the market leader.
Analysts say that beyond budget constraints, another factor may have played a role.
Historically, Mexico has chosen international companies for federal projects -- the development of oil wells, the electricity grid, the railway system, the telephone system and Mexico City's subway lines.
"Mexicans who are in power, for some reason, have a hard time believing that there are other Mexicans who are competent in building a national economy and may have some interesting answers," said Gary Chapman, the director of the 21st Century Project at the University of Texas. "This is a very serious liability for the country."
Some computer scientists in Mexico believe that history is repeating itself. "It's frustrating and slightly insulting that they haven't considered Mexicans to develop the software for e-Mexico," said Federico Mena Quintero, 25, a programmer in Mexico City. "It's like saying Mexicans aren't smart enough and we can't do the job, which is not true because Mexicans do make software that is just as good as Microsoft. Microsoft is not superhuman."
But Microsoft said that it is confident it can demonstrate that its software is right for this program. "We are convinced that our software is the best on the market, and we think that a project this big has room for everybody, including free software or software like ours," said Lorenzo Ortiz, Microsoft's spokesman in Mexico. "We are doing our part, and if the other guys would do their part, this market would be much bigger."
But how does a man like Mr. de Icaza participate in e-Mexico if his company, founded only three years ago, lacks the resources to train a nation of computer scientists? Perhaps he will not compete.
"I feel like I've been betrayed," Mr. de Icaza said. "I don't think anybody in Mexico was given the opportunity to participate in e-Mexico."
Mr. de Icaza has become a vocal critic of the government, contending that it is its duty "to protect the country's technology market, and they're not doing it."
"They're giving it away," he said.
That sort of philosophy does not find much support from Mr. Fox's pro-business, pro-market government, or from Mr. Margain, who said, "If open-source was the best practice, my question would be, 'Why doesn't everybody use it?' "

HEADLINE: U.S. Hasn't Kept Promise to Latin America, Critics Say 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 18 

 BODY:
During the 2000 campaign, George W. Bush promised to make relations with Latin America a "fundamental commitment of my presidency."
 From Mexico City to Buenos Aires, governments took notice. Leaders stuck to often harsh American economic prescriptions, aligned their foreign policies closer with Washington's and reworked their export regimes to prepare for free trade with the world's largest economy. 
 The United States responded, critics say, with nothing. 
As President Bush travels on Monday to Miami, a city often described as the capital of Latin America, he runs into a wall of dashed expectations, impatience and even a sense of betrayal by many countries in the region. Latin Americans complain that they have become the "afterthought" Mr. Bush had deplored.
Rather than ease their concerns, Mr. Bush's visit to South Florida merely underscores the region's sense of abandonment. While there, he will attest to the importance of domestic politics by attending a Cuban-American fund-raiser, then outline tough policy measures against Cuba that are opposed by virtually every country in Latin America.
"I think they're missing the ball," said Francisco Santos, the leading candidate to become Colombia's new vice president in elections later this month. "They're missing the sense of urgency of the problem in Colombia. I know they have big problems with Afghanistan, the Middle East, but this is the backyard."
For a Spanish-speaking president who revels in the Mexican influence in the American Southwest, the miscues and missed opportunities are striking after 16 months. Argentina, the region's third-largest economy and a close American ally for more than a decade, has been left to sink into economic collapse. Venezuela, the third-leading supplier of oil to the United States, is struggling to emerge from an attempted ouster of its president that the administration briefly appeared to endorse.
Chile, the region's economic wunderkind, sounds like a jilted bride. It has struggled since 1994 to seal a free-trade agreement with Washington. "We've been waiting since then," said Heraldo Munoz, the general secretary of the government, who noted that Chile just signed a trade pact with the European Union. "That's a bad signal for the region. If you have your house in order, then there should be some benefit coming out of it. That hasn't been the case."
After a decade of growth, trade contracted by nearly 4 percent in 2001 in Latin America, according to the Inter-American Development Bank, and the region's largest economies have stumbled, largely due to the American slowdown.
Republican and Democratic officials and analysts worry that the gains in Latin America over the past decade in democracy and free markets could be reversed. "I just think we're ignoring the hemisphere," said Representative Cass Ballenger, Republican of North Carolina and chairman of the House International Relations subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere.
Without intensive engagement by the United States, critics say, a model region -- in which 34 of 35 nations now have popularly elected leaders -- is showing signs of strain. As Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said in a recent speech, democracy must deliver a better life to sustain itself. "There is a disenchantment with the institutions of elective government," Secretary Powell told the Council of the Americas.
The administration has little to show for its stated priorities. Its plan to extend free trade across the hemisphere has languished for months, though the Senate now appears poised to grant the president trade promotion authority. Even that progress has been undercut by Mr. Bush's protectionist moves this spring to benefit American producers of steel and by his embrace of farm subsidies. Brazil, the linchpin of any future hemispheric deal, is considering retaliatory steps.
Meanwhile, the administration is wading more deeply into Colombia with a growing $1.7 billion investment and severe misgivings; officials do not see any easy solution for that drug-fueled civil war. 
Amid the signs of discontent, the cruelest cut for Mr. Bush came earlier this month from Mexico. President Vicente Fox, who may be Mr. Bush's closest friend among foreign leaders, blasted the administration for failing to act on his appeal to reform American immigration laws. 
In a speech in New York, Mr. Fox asserted that the United States-Mexico relationship had "stalled" and admitted that he had paid a political price for aligning Mexico more closely than ever with Washington.
"There can be no privileged U.S.-Mexico relationship without actual progress on substantive issues in our bilateral agenda," Mr. Fox said. "And there will be no substantive progress without comprehensively addressing the issue of migration."
Mexico is seeking changes in American policy that would regularize the status of millions of illegal workers, provide a temporary worker program and make border crossings less hazardous. So far, it has received the opposite: a crackdown on the border, which Vice President Dick Cheney this week defended as a "temporary necessity" in the struggle against terrorism.
By most accounts, Mr. Bush was off to a promising start. Within three months of taking office, he addressed the Organization of American States, a regional forum that previous presidents had long ignored. His first foreign trip was to Quebec, where he laid out his vision for a hemispheric free-trade area. He declared that the United States had no more important relationship than that with Mexico.
But now, officials acknowledge that the region has receded as a priority in the wake of Sept. 11. "It's not where the war is being fought," said one State Department official.
There was an improvised nature to Mr. Bush's trip to Mexico, El Salvador and Peru in March. He appeared at a United Nations summit meeting in Monterrey, Mexico, after a personal appeal from Mr. Fox, and hastily assembled a foreign aid package that officials said would grow by 50 percent over three years.
If the White House moves swiftly ahead on trade, it could mitigate the pent-up concerns of several countries. The president has said he will seek a free-trade agreement with Chile, a regional pact with Central America and the extension of trade preferences to Andean nations.
It may be more difficult to ease a perception of callousness by officials who stepped into the breach as the president focused elsewhere. Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill harshly dismissed calls to help bail out Argentina, saying, "Nobody forced them to be what they are."
Moreover, the administration's early embrace of the brief ouster of President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela last month left some Latin Americans doubting American support for democracy. After that, one Latin American diplomat lamented, "It's hard to believe how misinformed the administration was and is in relation to the region."

VENEZUELAPresident Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, briefly ousted last month, said American officials "really owe an explanation" for their early acceptance of his removal. COLOMBIAAs Colombia faces multiple crises and the collapse of peace talks, U.S. seeks to apply aid and equipment to counter insurgency as well as drugs.

HEADLINE: THE CLOSE READER; 
You Read Your Book and I'll Read Mine

BYLINE:  By Judith Shulevitz 

 BODY:
In Thomas Mann's novel "The Magic Mountain," Hans Castorp, a young bourgeois about to embark on a conventional career, visits an Alpine sanitarium for tuberculosis patients, becomes infatuated with one of them and is conveniently discovered to have a spot on one of his own lungs. He gets to spend the next several years as her fellow inmate. At the sanitarium Hans experiences an astonishing awakening. His infatuation inspires a craving for knowledge -- about art (his inamorata has posed for paintings), anatomy (her diseased one in particular), chemistry (disease again), consciousness, botany, the passage of time and the biological mystery of life, to name just a few of the topics his desire leads him to. Each book he reads functions as a fetish object: it magically ushers him into the presence of his beloved. Drifting off to sleep over a work on pathology, Hans "beheld the image of life, its voluptuous limbs, its flesh-borne beauty," Mann writes. "She bent toward him, bent down to him, over him, he sensed her organic aroma, sensed the lacelike pounding of her heart." 
 Mann's is probably the most satisfying account of passionate reading ever written. As any teacher can tell you, students read best when their reading brings them in contact with something or someone they love or are at least madly attracted to. We forget most of what we read, but we're more likely to retain some dim memory of books assigned to us by professors we idolized, lent to us by friends we had unspoken crushes on or connected to the heart-stopping events of our lives. Of course, most people no longer have access to the pedagogical eros that roils exciting classrooms or teacher-student or student-student relationships. So for us postgraduate Americans, there are substitutes: reading groups, the One Book, One City program and, until several weeks ago, Oprah Winfrey's book club. 
 Actually, Oprah's book choices never had any connection to pedagogy. She picked books that spoke to her. "The aim is pleasure and personal growth, not discomfort," D. T. Max wrote in a 1999 article on Oprah's Book Club. This explains its success. Oprah's book recommendations were meant not to instruct but to entertain and heal. Her books served as substitutes for the overflowing mother love that has always made Oprah so soothingly irresistible. Oprah's club was a way for her to nurture her fans even after they turned the television off, which may be why she was drawn to stories of recovery and redemption. 
Mother love, on the other hand, couldn't be farther from the minds of the administrators of the One Book, One City program. This reading drive, which began in Seattle four years ago and has since swept the country (except for New York, where it occasioned a rousing outburst of disagreeableness), seeks to boost "community," whatever that is, as well as library attendance. Each book is selected to attract as many readers as possible and to offend none, which is to say that most of the choices are mediocre. Every time I hear of library officials priding themselves on the program's social benefits, I think of George Babbitt jerry-building some shady real estate scheme and telling himself it will be good for the city of Zenith. Even if the chosen book is great, I can't imagine a reader getting a thrill out of something officials have designated a tool of civic improvement unless he miraculously manages to wriggle free of that crushingly unsexy concept.
Despite what your high school English teacher may have told you, literature does not make us or our society better. To be seduced by fiction is to live at cross-purposes with most of the really important things in life. I've never entirely succumbed to a story without blowing off housework, neglecting social obligations and flubbing career-critical deadlines. Mann linked reading to lust and disease and decay. "The Magic Mountain," the critic James Wood says, "is a Bildungsroman and a parody of one, because Hans Castorp's education at the sanatorium is really an education in death." Hans is a man alarmingly blessed with the quality Keats called negative capability, which is the ability to suspend one's impatient presumptions long enough to take in the new and the difficult. This may be admirable in a poet, but enlightened passivity is surely not what mayors have in mind when they say they want cities full of readers.
What they have in mind is what economists call social capital, which is the trust between people that lets them get along well enough to build businesses and other useful institutions. One Book, One City people believe that reading as a group will turn us into a unified body of productive citizens. That's a noble goal, I guess, and not all that different from what some cultural pundits hope for when they call for a return to a traditional curriculum. Our students need a common body of knowledge, they say; otherwise, we will not cohere as a culture. 
What canon warriors often overlook, though, is that few of the books included on the usual lists actually espouse the Western values they're supposed to espouse. We're told to read the canon because it's the repository of our cultural heritage, which is broadly true in the sense that some of our forebears read some of these books on occasion. In the narrow sense, however, most writers now considered canonical wouldn't have recognized a Western idea if it bit them -- they considered themselves Greek or Hebrew or Christian, not Western, and bitterly opposed most of the other ideas now mushed together into the porridge pot that is our idealized past. "Western civilization" is a construct of early -- that is to say, 18th-century -- modernity, not a product of what's in those books. 
None of this matters if core curriculum classes teach students to question the falsely coherent narrative of intellectual progress that canonical books are said to exemplify, which is what happens in the best of such classes. Likewise, there's nothing wrong with a reading group if it leads to vigorous debate. I can't think of any better training for the lifelong struggle with good books that Harold Bloom believes is the prerequisite for serious reading than learning to hold one's own against a group. 
This process, however, has nothing to do with coming together and everything to do with breaking apart, with figuring out how to live as an independent intellect and a soul loyal to its own needs. Literature takes root in a rich and stubborn particularity, not in some powdery notion of communal uplift. I've been to reading groups where participants understood this, and groups where the majority seized on some stifling banality and spent the rest of the evening ganging up on anyone who challenged it. It all depends on who's leading the group and what that person hopes to accomplish by it. I'd feel safer attending a group animated by Oprah than one haunted by George Babbitt, but I'd be happiest reading my book at home.

It's in the Stars: ABull Market Is Ascending

BYLINE:  By AMY CORTESE 

 BODY:
Up? Down? Sideways? Investors frustrated by the zigzagging stock market can take heart: if all unfolds according to a cosmic plan, we may be in for another roaring bull market.
 That is the outlook from the Astrologers Fund, a New York-based financial advisory firm that uses astrology to divine market performance. On Friday, the firm presented its forecast for 2002 and 2003 at its 10th Annual Astrology and Stock Market Forecasting Seminar in New York. The date was no coincidence: May 17 was the 210th birthday of the New York Stock Exchange (making the Big Board a Taurus, sign of the bull). 
 The main celestial indicators are a shift late this month from the apprehensive gloom of the Saturn-Pluto cycle that started last August to the more expansive combination of Jupiter and Neptune, according to Henry Weingarten, a 54-year-old Leo who is the founder and managing director of the Astrologers Fund and an author of books on astrology and investing. 
Compared with Saturn-Pluto, the impending Jupiter-Neptune configuration could be downright giddy, setting off a bull market late this year that could continue into 2003. Or so say the planets.
Mr. Weingarten warns of a "new silly season," in which valuations, particularly in the biotechnology sector, could once again become unrealistic. While that could mean profitable trading opportunities, Mr. Weingarten warned, "Investors better have learned the lessons of 2000." 
Mr. Weingarten not only charts the big picture, but also takes into account the charts of individual companies, based on their date of incorporation. I.B.M., one of his top stock picks for 2001 based in part on its astrological chart, remains one of his favorites despite being down almost 30 percent so far this year. He is also bullish on gold, which could offset Jupiter's inflationary tendencies. Defense stocks, a Saturn-Pluto staple, are downgraded.
Mr. Weingarten, who also uses conventional research techniques, says astrology is a great tool for timing the market. But other influences can come into play, too. 
After being given 250,000 shares of U.N. Dollars, the over-the-counter stock of an Astrologers Fund client, Mr. Weingarten started recommending it in his weekly newsletter in January 2000 and bought $75,000 of the shares for his clients' portfolios. That inspired earthly intervention by the Securities and Exchange Commission, to which he paid a $15,000 fine to settle a complaint in March, without admitting or denying wrongdoing. AMY CORTESE

Many 'Star Wars' fanswent online to avoid a long line.

BYLINE:  By Sarah Milstein 

 BODY:
WHEN "The Empire Strikes Back," the first "Star Wars" sequel, opened in 1980, fans dressed as their favorite characters and lined up days before to buy tickets. Predictably, the latest sequel, which opened on Thursday, also had strong advance interest.
 But fewer moviegoers waited in line. Instead, many bought their tickets online -- through AOL Moviefone, MovieTickets, Fandango or the ticket-sales Web sites of various theater chains. 
 Consumers who pay a fee of $1 or so to buy movie tickets online now make up about 3 percent of box office sales, according to industry estimates, and ticketing executives predict the number will grow to 10 percent or more within a few years. And as each service hopes to grab a bigger share of the online market, the three main ticketing companies are looking to sell more than tickets, through advertising and marketing deals.
"Ticketing is a great sign of vitality for your site, but the real business is advertising," said Tommy McGloin, senior vice president and general manager at AOL Moviefone, a unit of AOL Time Warner. He said that many consumers who once looked to newspapers for movie listings and reviews now turn to the Web, and he predicted that movie studios would begin to apportion their marketing budgets accordingly. 
"Movie marketers are realizing that more investment should go into reaching moviegoers where they make decisions about going to the movies," Mr. McGloin said. "I want to grow Moviefone as the place where people go to get movie information." 
Jupiter Media Metrix, a Web measurement firm, said that in October, AOL Moviefone, MovieTickets and Fandango had a combined 4.4 million individual visitors to their sites. By April, that number had increased to just over 7 million -- about 4.7 million visitors to Moviefone, 1.2 million to Movietickets and 1.1 to Fandango.
The Web did not even exist when Moviefone made its debut in 1989 as a phone service. Initially, moviegoers in New York and Los Angeles could call 777-FILM and hear movie schedules from the rumbling voice of Mr. Moviefone. The service later expanded nationwide, and a ticket-buying feature was added in 1991. 
Moviefone still sells about half of its tickets through its automated telephone service, and Fandango sells an undisclosed portion of its tickets by phone through an independent service provider, 800-TellMe. But executives for both companies say phone sales are now more a customer convenience than a big revenue generator. MovieTickets sells only through the Web. 
Rick King, a spokesman for AMC Theaters, recalled that Moviefone had initially obtained show schedule information free, whether directly from the theaters or from their published advertisements, and built its business selling sponsorships and ads that ran during phone calls. "Theater companies at the time didn't realize the value of their own show times," he said. "This company came along and said, 'I'd like to sell tickets by phone, and I need access to your inventory and show times.' They were selling our goods and services." 
Theater owners learned from the experience. When the Internet became a hot medium for ticket vending in the late 1990's (the Moviefone.com Web site started in 1995, and America Online bought the company for $388 million in 1999), theater companies sought to gain control of their own remote sales. 
A consortium of leading theater chains and industry companies, including AMC Entertainment, National Amusements and Famous Players, which is part of Viacom, banded together and founded MovieTickets in 2000. Fandango was created that same year by six major exhibitor partners and two venture capitalists.
The ticketing companies have deals with specific theater chains. Fandango, for instance, sells tickets for Cinemark, a major chain in the Midwest that also sells tickets through its own Web site. Moviefone and MovieTickets sell tickets for each other's chains, which include AMC Theaters; National Amusements; United Artists Theaters, controlled by Regal Entertainment; and Clearview Cinemas, part of Cablevision. 
In April, Fandango filed suit against Moviefone and Onex, which owns the Loews Cineplex chain, saying that Moviefone had interfered with a deal that was supposed to have made Fandango the exclusive online ticket distributor for Loews Cineplex. Moviefone has denied the accusation.
Whatever the specifics of any one deal, the business works essentially the same way for all the ticketing companies: they divide the service fee with theaters after credit card companies take a percentage for processing the transaction. That is another reason the online ticket sellers want to expand their advertising revenue -- to generate more money that they can keep for themselves. 
According to the Motion Picture Association of America, there were 189 major Hollywood studio releases in 2001, with an average advertising budget of $27 million. Web sites that post film information hope to draw moviegoers away from newspaper listings and capture a parallel share of those studio budgets. 
"Movie marketers haven't decreased their ad spending online, unlike a lot of other categories," said Mr. McGloin of Moviefone, who noted that Moviefone.com derived 90 percent of its revenues from advertising. 
A new study commissioned by AOL Moviefone found that Hollywood studios spent only 1 or 2 percent of their ad dollars online. But the study reported that about 30 percent of moviegoers indicated they were influenced to see a film by information they found on the Web. 
For ticketing companies, the gap in ad spending and the level of Web activity represents an advertising sales opportunity. For exhibitors, Internet ticket sales may help reduce costs, because online sales incur much lower labor costs. And theater executives say they glean useful information from ticket sales made before films open. 
"We are opening new product every week, and we're never fully certain how it's going to perform in the marketplace," said Mr. King at AMC. "With advance ticketing, we can get much more accurate attendance projections, which influence staffing, show times and the number of screens for a film." 
To lure more customers, theater and ticketing companies are offering additional services on their sites. MovieTickets and Fandango have recently started print-at-home ticketing for a small number of theaters around the country already equipped with the necessary bar-code readers, and many more are to be added this year. Promotional deals involving the online vendors, theaters and local restaurants are also in the works. 
Even as the number of visitors to ticketing sites grows, though, some analysts question whether there is room in the market for all the Web ticket sellers to succeed. David Card, a senior analyst with Jupiter Media Metrix, is one of those who predict that one or more of the three ticketing sites will eventually merge.
Whatever antitrust concerns might arise, consumers, who must visit at least two sites to buy tickets at competing theaters, might benefit from a streamlined search process. And certainly, a single ticketing company with most of Web traffic could gain more studio marketing dollars. 
"You're looking at a hybrid step now," said Mitchell Rubenstein, co-chief executive of MovieTickets. "Later in the year or next year, you might see just one company."

It's a First-Class Gridlock, but No Easier to Unlock

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, May 19 

 BODY:
Rush hour is an oxymoron in this impossible metropolis. It takes two hours to crawl across town. The city is choking on the fumes from three million private cars, 150,000 taxis and 100,000 buses.
 Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador is, God help him, the mayor of the capital, home to roughly 20 million people, a fifth of the nation. He would like to be Mexico's next president. If he could solve Mexico City's traffic problems, he could probably be elected emperor. 
 So should he extend the astoundingly cheap and efficient subway system, or start a billion-dollar project to turn the city's busiest roads into double-decker highways?
That is not a simple question. The answer involves money and politics, of course, but also questions of race and class.
"What is the best way to ease congestion?" said Dr. Mario J. Molina, a Mexico City native, Nobel Prize-winning scientist and consultant to Mexico's City's government. "It's a classic dilemma: when you build more highways, do you decrease pollution or increase traffic? The only way to solve it is to increase public transportation."
The mayor first chose the highway route, with a plan to add a second story to the city's two most heavily traveled roads, the Periferico and the Viaducto, where the average speed is now seven miles per hour. His administration says that if there is more space on the roads and cars can move more freely, pollution will decrease.
Construction was to have started this month, promising years of chaos and providing a chance for even more cars to complicate life in this megacity. Last week, Mayor Lopez Obrador tapped the brakes: the cost and complexity may cause cause him to scale down the project, adding a double deck only to the most choked sectors of the city. 
But he is also planning the first expansion of the subway system in years, though a relatively modest one: four more miles of track that could serve an additional 250,000 people, most of them poor.
The subway costs 20 cents and traverses the heart of the city in 20 minutes. Figures compiled by New York City's transit authority show the Mexico City subway system tied with New York's for fourth place among the world's busiest, with 1.3 billion riders a year. (Moscow, with 3.2 billion, takes the gold, followed by Tokyo and Seoul.)
The argument in Mexico City over whether to build more roads or better mass transit breaks down sharply along class lines. People who are richer -- and, to put it bluntly, whiter, with more Spanish than Indian blood -- tend to favor the idea of the double-decker highways. People who are poorer and browner would like to have more Metro lines.
"The lower you go in the social scale, the more people use public transportation," said the city's environmental coordinator, Claudia Sheinbaum. "Richer people prefer to use private cars."
Manuel Sanchez, 36, is a chauffeur for a rich family in a far-flung suburb of the city. His daily commute lasts four hours, and he spends much of his working day in traffic.
"The second deck isn't going to solve anything, except give people a reason to use the cars that they don't use now because there's too much traffic," Mr. Sanchez said. "The more roads they build, the more cars will appear. 
"The children will use the second car -- the mothers, the fathers. It's too much.
"The Metro is a magnificent system," he added. "It's fast, safe and doesn't pollute. Lopez Obrador should be thinking of more ways to expand it."
But the subway is beneath many middle-class Mexicans, who refuse to ride it because the poor people do.
"People on the Metro push and shove," said Francisco Estrada, 41, a theater technician. "And they smell like onions."
Santiago Creuheras, 28, an economic development officer for the city, said simply, if a bit sniffily, "The Metro is for people who don't have cars."
Owning a car is the only sure sign in Mexico that one has arrived in the middle class. For decades, there has been one car in Mexico that striving people could afford, and only one: the Volkswagen Beetle.
At a cost of less than $8,000, the "Bocho," or Bug, has been the key to the highway for the masses in Mexico for many years. The old Beetle is still manufactured in Mexico -- a plant in Puebla is the only one in the world still making the classic car in its original form -- and hundreds of thousands are on this city's streets.
Most of the cars in the city's taxi fleet are also Beetles, many of them old and in poor repair. Part of the mayor's transportation strategy is a $10 million program of credits and subsidies to persuade taxi drivers to trade in their old Beetles for four-door cars with higher environmental and fuel-efficiency standards.
Ms. Sheinbaum says she is convinced that the double-decker highway will lead to less pollution, even if it leads to more cars, by allowing traffic to move more freely. 
"Mexico City is so densely populated right now, our traffic and congestion problems are so bad, that we have to have more roads," she said. "You can only expand one of two ways: expropriate land for more streets, ripping up trees and waterways, or build a second floor for the highways."
"We hope to have reduced atmospheric pollution and increased the average velocity in the city," she added -- if the money holds out and the project is completed by the target date of 2006, which happens to be the year of the next presidential election.
"Life in the city will be better," she said, hopefully.
Mr. Estrada, the theater technician, has his doubts, though.
"There are," he said, "simply too many people in this city in too little space."

HEADLINE: New York Expands Experiment to Bring Courts and Communities Closer 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT F. WORTH 

 BODY:
Judge Rolando T. Acosta may be sitting in Manhattan, but when he speaks -- calling the defendants by their first names and imploring them to listen to their parents' advice -- he sounds more like the small-town judge in "To Kill a Mockingbird."
 "I'm going to release you to your mom, but only on certain conditions," the judge told one defendant last week, a penitent-looking 14-year-old boy in a T-shirt and baggy jeans who had confessed to writing graffiti on a city-owned building. "You've got to be home every night by 9 p.m. You must continue to attend counseling sessions here at the court. And you've got to attend our Hard Hats program on Saturdays." 
 Judge Acosta is the lone presiding judge at the Harlem Community Justice Center, the latest addition to the city's ongoing experiment with community courts. The court's juvenile intervention wing, which began hearing cases in January, will officially open today in a ceremony to be attended by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and other city and state officials. 
The new court, in a spectacular Victorian Gothic building on East 121st Street, is intended to make justice more accessible to a community plagued by crime, and to address crime's root causes with a battery of social services like drug treatment, psychological counseling and mentoring for adolescents. It is part of a nationwide movement toward community-based problem-solving courts that began with the Midtown Community Court in Manhattan in 1993.
Planners hope to redefine the way courts work by bringing them closer to communities. 
"If you were to distill this down to its essence, it's about improving public confidence in the criminal justice system," said Greg Berman, the director of the Center for Court Innovation, a public-private partnership in New York that is the prime mover in the courts' development.
The new courts, which handle low-level crimes and some civil matters, like housing disputes, have generally been well received. But some lawyers and academics say that in their efforts to address the social problems that lead to crime, community courts can become overly paternalistic, generating harsher punishments and funneling more people into the criminal justice system. 
"I appreciate the effort to do things differently, but I share some concerns about courts of this type being more expansive than necessary," said Leonard E. Noisette, executive director of the Neighborhood Defender Service of Harlem, which has represented several people in the new courthouse. 
In a sense, the new courts represent a return to tradition. The city's courts were once spread throughout its neighborhoods, and it was not until the 1960's, burdened by excessive caseloads, that they were centralized. (The Harlem and Midtown community courts are in buildings that once housed local courts.)
But by the late 1980's, some judges were frustrated by the courts' inability to change the chronic problems that plague low-income areas.
"For some problems -- drugs are a good example -- dealing with the individual case alone doesn't help," said Judith S. Kaye, the chief justice of the New York State Court of Appeals, who helped create the city's community courts. "It's better to deal with the underlying problem."
With that goal in mind, the Midtown Community Court was created in 1993. Paid for in part by local business groups (including The New York Times Company Foundation), the court handles misdemeanors like low-level drug use, prostitution and vandalism. 
Two years ago the city introduced a second effort, the Red Hook Community Justice Center, in a refurbished Catholic school in Brooklyn.
In a sense, the Red Hook and Harlem courts are the more radical experiments. Situated in low-income residential areas, their goal is to restore a trust in the criminal justice system that has been badly frayed, said Jeffrey Fagan, a professor of law and public health at Columbia University who is directing evaluations of both courts.
The courts bring together elements that are usually separated -- housing, family and drug cases -- in one small building, so people can deal with several related problems at the same time. 
On a recent morning at the Harlem court, for instance, landlords and tenants who showed up to sue each other were greeted cheerfully by a case manager with a clipboard who asked them to fill out a form describing their problems and complaints. At the court's Resource Center, three employees of the Human Resources Administration help them apply for public assistance or loans in an effort to forestall litigation.
"With housing court, 99 percent of the cases are nonpayment, so it makes sense to deal with those economic issues in the building," Judge Acosta said.
Although many people who have used the court note that it is less crowded than the courthouses downtown, this may change. The Harlem courthouse will eventually hear about 18 percent of all housing matters in Manhattan, roughly 15,000 cases annually.
The Harlem court's juvenile intervention wing also provides a stark contrast with the more crowded courts downtown. Teenagers arrested for nonviolent felony and misdemeanor offenses in its jurisdiction, which includes all of East and much of Central Harlem -- the 23rd, 25th and 28th Precincts -- are generally referred to the court. When a teenager arrives, a probation officer conducts an interview, to get as much information as possible about the problems that may have led to the arrest.
Court officers try to contact the defendant's parents and teachers.
They schedule drug tests, and soon appear at a hearing with Judge Acosta. He can order counseling, drug treatment or a mentor for the teenager, or even recommend job training for the parents. Often he orders appearances at the court's weekend community service program, which may involve painting rails or raking leaves at the Harlem Art Park, behind the courthouse.
The court also has a Youth Court program, in which children or teenagers who have been caught in minor crimes by the police or at school face a court composed entirely of peers, complete with school-age prosecutors, defense advocates, judges and juries. Sentences consist mostly of community service or essay-writing. Although the penalties are voluntary, few fail to obey them, court officers say.
Teenage offenders are likely to face a tougher -- or at least more time-consuming -- penalty in community court than they would have encountered downtown. To some local residents, this is just fine. 
"Kids need to do something constructive," said Edna Smith, who sat in Harlem Art Park on a recent Saturday, watching her son rake leaves as part of a community service project. "Especially in a neighborhood like this. This morning I walked out of my hallway and saw eight guys walking in to buy drugs from a dealer who lives in the building."

HEADLINE: Fear and Rage in Gaza, And Threats by Hamas 

BYLINE:  By TIM GOLDEN 

DATELINE: GAZA CITY, May 19 

 BODY:
As graphic scenes of the latest suicide bombing flashed across his television screen, a top political leader of the militant Palestinian group Hamas hunched forward on his living room couch today, speaking to the broadcast over his cellphone.
 "Sharon and his government have been assassinating our people, our women and our children!" the leader, Abdel Aziz al-Rantisi, told the viewers of an Arab news network, who saw his picture in a box beneath the gore. "They must pay a price for every crime they commit." 
 Dr. Rantisi said he had no idea whether the military arm of Hamas was responsible for today's attack, as an anonymous caller told one news agency office in Jerusalem. Another militant group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, issued a statement saying it had carried out the bombing. 
But in an interview as he took calls from television and radio stations around the world, Dr. Rantisi waved away any notion that the bombing might have ended a lull in the violence between Israelis and Palestinians.
"This hasn't been a quiet week," he said. "Every day, the Israelis were killing Palestinians -- in Rafah, in Tulkarm. So we have to attack them -- in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem or anywhere else in Israel."
If the Palestinian leadership around Yasir Arafat was quick to condemn the killing of Israeli civilians today, Dr. Rantisi, a 54-year-old pediatrician, was just as quick to justify it. "Martyrdom operations," he said, would continue unabated so long as the Palestinians had no better way to fight the Israeli occupation of their territories.
Despite the bullet holes still visible in his garage door from a failed attempt by Mr. Arafat's police to arrest him last December, Dr. Rantisi added that he was unperturbed by the prospect that the Palestinian authorities might again crack down on Hamas and other Islamic militants.
Of at least 17 men said to be Hamas militants who were arrested by the Palestinian authorities after the last suicide bombing inside Israel on May 7, he said, none were actual members of the group and most of them had already been freed.
"Mr. Arafat is under two sets of pressures," he said. "One is from the Israelis, the Americans and the Europeans. But the other pressure is from his own people, and nearly all the Palestinians support martyrdom operations."
Along the sandy, unpaved streets surrounding Dr. Rantisi's home here, old men sat chatting on plastic chairs and scruffy children ran around playing before dinner. A chorus of distant television sets blared the same news.
Once again, the talk turned to the possibility that after the Israeli Army's offensive against Palestinian cities and towns in the West Bank, Gaza could be next.
"People are very worried," said Ahmed Dahsan, the owner of a hardware store in downtown Gaza City. "It's been more than a month now that they have been preparing for this. But if they come into Gaza, it will be worse than in the West Bank. It is very crowded here, and the people are very angry."
Israeli officials concurred with the notion that the recent lull in violence was more apparent than real, citing a series of Palestinian attacks against Israeli soldiers and settlers. Last week, a senior Israeli military official told reporters in Washington that one more suicide bombing might be enough to activate the offensive into Gaza that commanders prepared and then put off two weeks ago.
But after long weeks of waiting in which they laid in stores of food and supplies, people in Gaza also seemed to have more concrete problems in mind.
Im Maher Karmout, an elderly woman in a head scarf, complained that Israeli troops had demolished her home last month to make room for a military post, leaving her with only paltry compensation from the Palestinian housing ministry and the United Nations.
Abdel Karim, a 40-year-old marine engineer, said he had not been able to find work for months. Khalil Abu Warda chimed in that nobody had been finding any work -- not in a place where the labor force is blocked from travel into Israel and more than two-thirds of workers are unemployed.
"People here have nothing to do but pray," Mr. Karim said. "Not for money or for a new car, but for something to eat."
Such grievances have left rich political terrain for Hamas, which opposes any peace talks and hopes to replace Israel with an Islamic state. Opinion polls indicate that Palestinian support for the group, which also operates a network of social charities, has doubled to about 25 percent since the current uprising began in September 2000.
That popularity has coincided with new political maneuvering by Hamas, including suggestions by the group's leaders that it might participate in a transitional coalition government or even in new elections -- in the unlikely event that they were free of any constraints by the Israeli government.
"We need elections," another Hamas leader, Ismail Abu Shanab, said in a separate interview. "But what is an election under Israeli occupation? An election is about freedom -- freedom of travel, of association, of speech -- and we do not have any of those freedoms."
Another Hamas leader, Mahmoud al-Zahar, said the group saw no reason to change its tactics now.
"Give me one reason why the Palestinians should give up armed struggle" demanded Dr. Zahar, a surgeon. "The peaceful methods, democracy and negotiation, have failed."

HEADLINE: Philadelphians Jittery Over Plan to Privatize 20 Schools 

BYLINE:  By JACQUES STEINBERG 

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA, May 17 

 BODY:
The students and teachers at John B. Stetson Middle School spent much of this week immersed in the age-old rituals of the season, preparing for a last round of standardized tests and gossiping about who was escorting whom to the eighth-grade prom.
 But the excitement has been tempered this year by sudden jitters about Edison Schools Inc., the for-profit company whose plans to take over management of Stetson and 19 other public schools here have been cast into doubt by several shocks to its precarious finances. 
 Edison officials said this week that they needed to raise up to $50 million from investors in the next few weeks, largely to cover start-up costs in Philadelphia. Without that money, Edison said, the company will have to pull out of the city. The new school year, meanwhile, is less than four months away. 
While Edison said it had enough cash to reopen for business next fall in the more than 100 schools it already manages in 22 states, its financial crisis could eventually threaten its ability to sustain those operations, at least at current levels. With the company's future at stake, so is the very notion at the heart of the Edison experiment: that the private sector can run public schools more effectively and efficiently than the districts themselves.
This was a difficult week for Edison, by far the nation's largest commercial operator of public schools. It settled an inquiry by the Securities and Exchange Commission on Tuesday, confirmed that it had lost a longtime contract for a large charter school in Boston on Wednesday and had run afoul of one of its biggest clients, the Las Vegas school district. The district disclosed that it was withholding about $3 million until Edison secured $2.2 million in charitable contributions that the company had promised it.
"I look up the Edison stock almost every day," Juan Oquendo, an eighth grader at Stetson, said on Thursday, when the company's share price fell as low as $1.63, a tenth of what it had been only a few months ago. "I feel like they're going to take us down." 
As word of the company's setbacks has reached the halls of the schools it runs or is committed to running around the country, some districts have begun reviewing contract provisions that would limit the disruptions to classroom life should Edison suddenly retrench.
While emphasizing that they saw "no immediate threat" of Edison's demise, officials in Long Beach, Calif., where Edison helps manage an elementary school, said the school would revert to the district if that happened. Edison would be entitled to take back its computers and perhaps textbooks, though the district would seek to keep any supplementary materials until the end of the school year, said Chris Eftychiou, a district spokesman.
Other schools and districts said they had yet to consider any contingency plans. "We have been informed that things are business as usual," said Denise Patton, principal of San Jose Edison Academy, a school operated by Edison and the West Covina school district in California. "The fickleness of investors, I can't spend time dwelling on that."
The situation is far more tenuous in Philadelphia, where no one can say for sure how the company's flagging fortunes will affect the 14,500 children who are to be entrusted to the company's care.
The greatest unknown remains whether Edison can raise enough money to meet its early obligations in Philadelphia, which include training teachers in Edison methods as well as buying books and computers, all before September.
As the state panel overseeing the district continues, meanwhile, to negotiate a contract with the company and municipal unions, it has yet to determine whether principals will be employees of the district or Edison, or whether those principals will have the authority to pick their teachers. Nor is it clear whether Edison will extend the school day and year, as it has elsewhere. 
Questions about Edison's intentions and stability were raised repeatedly on Thursday night at Laura W. Waring School, another school assigned to the company, where Richard Barth, an Edison senior vice president, met with several dozen parents, children and community members.
"We are confident we will get the cash to open these schools," Mr. Barth said. But, he added, if the money is not raised, Edison will abandon its plans for the city. 
His words did little to ease the fears of some parents here.
"It is really a lot of red tape," said Crystal Wright, a parent of two children at Waring, and a teacher at an elementary school that is not part of the Edison experiment. "You don't come into an urban area that is already strapped and say you're going to raise $50 million."
The next afternoon, the company's stock price lost another 38 cents, closing at $1.37 today, its lowest point since the company went public in 1999, at an initial offering price of $18. It reached its high of $36.75 in February 2001.
At Stetson Middle School, an 87-year-old red-brick shoe box, the main worry is that Edison, however inadvertently, may interrupt the progress that the school has made in recent years.
The principal, Lucy Rodriguez, takes special pride in the school's sprawling library, from which Stetson's 987 students have checked out 17,142 books this year -- a sixfold increase from 1995.
Over the same period, the percentage of students scoring at or above the "basic" level on reading tests nearly doubled, to more than 40 percent, in a school in which 1 of 6 students arrive speaking only Spanish.
Still, the principal and parents at Stetson acknowledge that they have a long way to go -- fewer than 10 percent of students scored at or above the "proficient" level on those tests -- which is why the state is turning the school over to Edison.
Rhonda Thompson, vice president of Stetson's Home and School Association, a parent group, said she had learned from Edison's Web site that it strives to involve parents in managing schools, retrains teachers and puts a premium on test scores.
"Anything 'extra' is very much welcome," said Ms. Thompson, the mother of an eighth grader. 
Should Edison leave any time before the end of its contract -- the duration under negotiation is two to three years -- then, Ms. Thompson said, the school will have lost nothing for having tried.
The school's teachers, whose union had opposed Edison's arrival, were more skeptical. They said they had puzzled over the logic of transferring 20 city schools from a district with a $100 million operating deficit to a 10-year-old company that had never made a profit.
"If the stock is dropping like that, it means there's not a lot of faith out there in what they're doing," said Michele Miller, a computer science teacher. "I don't want to be a part of that."

HEADLINE: Midwest Towns Feel Gambling Is a Sure Thing 

BYLINE:  By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: BOONVILLE, Mo. 

 BODY:
To this quaint Missouri River town named for Daniel Boone's discovery of a salt lick nearby, the new Isle of Capri casino's promise is more than 800 jobs and $4.5 million in annual tax revenue for City Hall. It is seen as the long-sought catalyst that could turn an anonymous community into a regional destination. 
 Already, a Holiday Inn Express has opened near the Interstate, and half a dozen new restaurants are sprouting amid the spruced-up store fronts of Main Street. With an $800,000 donation from the casino, the Friends of Historic Boonville are renovating Thespian Hall, the oldest continuously operating theater west of the Mississippi. A display at the entrance of the turquoise-and-peach gambling palace points visitors toward the Katy Trail, a 19th-century railroad now popular for hiking and biking. 
 "Like Highway 40 and like the river before that, this casino's going to be another turning point for Boonville," said Judy Shields, 62, a local historian whose family's roots were planted here in 1821. "I'm not saying it's Boonville's salvation, but it does bring opportunity." 
The Midwest casino boom -- there are now 86 commercial casinos in six states and 87 American Indian operations -- is part of a broader diversification of the economy in a region long-dependent on dying industries that now increasingly relies on tourism and entertainment, not as supplemental extras but as necessary pillars. The strategy was validated this winter as mild weather and post-Sept. 11 fear of flying kept many vacationers close to home. Casino revenues here in Missouri were up 18 percent in February and 11 percent in March compared with last year, and two St. Louis casinos had their best months ever in February. 
As manufacturing and agriculture have sagged, rural areas and cities alike have turned to the service sector to create jobs and generate economic activity. Casinos, which locate where factories will not and succeed where malls and multiplexes cannot, have been among the most reliable engines of change, helping to spawn glossy new museums, reconstructed downtowns and a slew of cultural festivals that draw thousands to unlikely places. 
"It's not just casino and it's not just convention center and it's not just sports venue," said Don Phares, an economist at the University of Missouri-St. Louis who has studied gambling and tourism. "There's a critical mass when you get enough of these things that begins to set you apart. The whole is more than the sum of its parts." 
In Deadwood, S.D., which brought commercial casinos to the Midwest in 1989, there is a Mardi Gras extravaganza and five-day summer rodeo; the actor Kevin Costner, who runs a casino in town, plans a $110 million resort. 
A trio of casinos has helped bring Council Bluffs, Iowa, out of Omaha's shadow, with up to 10 million visitors a year flocking to the city of 58,000. 
Then there is the mini-Orlando thriving in the Quad Cities (Davenport and Bettendorf in Iowa, and Rock Island and Moline in Illinois) where modern riverboat gambling was born a decade ago. An IMAX theater just opened in Davenport, across the Mississippi River from the John Deere museum in Moline, which has logged one million guests since opening in 1997. A botanical center with meeting rooms was built on the river banks in Rock Island three years back, and there is talk of a new amphitheater, which the Davenport mayor wants to build in honor of Buffalo Bill Cody. 
Before casinos, the Quad Cities "was just a river stop on I-80 -- a lot of people would stop and say, 'Gee, is that the Mississippi River Mark Twain wrote about?' " said Bernie Goldstein, a a Bettendorf scrap-metal magnate who turned the first riverboat into the 14-casino Isle of Capri chain. 
"Now we are at the nucleus of a small recreation area," Mr. Goldstein said. 
Politicians and business leaders who turned to gambling during the last recession as a stopgap measure to save hard-hit communities and buffer state budgets have seen, through the recent downturn, that casinos have become a linchpin of the region's slow but steady economic shift. 
"We still have a notion in the economic development field that we can get home runs -- the reality is that economic development is happening in increments," said Geoff Hewings, a professor at the University of Illinois who runs the Regional Economics Applications Lab, a research organization based in Chicago. 
"As our region's economy has transformed itself to become almost as diversified as the nation as a whole, we're better off," Professor Hewings said. "The tourism industry is part of that diversification, and the casino industry is part of tourism." 
In the past decade, slot machines have become as common as smokestacks on the heartland horizon. Airports in Kansas City and St. Louis, Omaha and Detroit, beckon travelers with billboards hawking Las Vegas-style blackjack and buffets. Except for Deadwood, where nearly every storefront has a gambling license, the number of casinos in the region has jumped from 38 to 46 in the past four years, with three major outlets opening as part of an effort to revive downtown Detroit in 1999 and 2000. State and local governments facing deficits have grown addicted to gambling revenue. The region's casinos paid $1.8 billion in taxes last year, up 71 percent from 1998. With 56,000 workers in 2001, up 30 percent from 1998, the Midwest's commercial casinos have helped stabilize employment rates as factories close (Indian casinos would not provide comparable numbers). 
The Missouri Riverboat Gaming Association estimates that one in four of its workers is a former welfare recipient, and 16 percent came off the unemployment rolls. Buoyed by record revenues this winter, Missouri lawmakers tried to raise casino taxes and remove the state's loss limit -- unique in the nation -- which bars players from risking more than $500 every two hours. At the same time, the Kansas and Ohio Legislatures have bills pending to allow slot machines at racetracks, while Indiana may soon let gambling drift from boats to docks. 
Towns without casinos are on the verge of being at a disadvantage, said Steve Rittvo, president of the Innovation Group, a New Orleans consulting company that does feasibility studies for the industry. "I don't think conventions go to Kansas City because they have casinos now, but I think they might not go to Indianapolis because they don't have them." 
Though critics complain of increased rates of bankruptcy and crime in casino towns, economists have found solid benefits, particularly in the Midwest, where regulation protected markets against oversaturation. 
Boonville, a town without a movie theater, represents the industry's next frontier, with a casino in the state's center, rather than along its borders, and moored, not on the river, but in a large puddle filled from fire hydrants (state law no longer requires the "riverboats" to ever sail, and demands only that they be within 1,000 yards of the water, making it easier for the industry to operate). 
Despite the familiar din of slot machines swallowing coins, the $75 million casino here, like many in the Midwest, is not a vast show palace but a clubby place where dealers know players' names. The average loss per visit is $45, compared with $60 in bigger casinos. 
For every player like the wholesaler who drives 106 miles from Lebanon, Mo., a few times a week and has lost $30,000 since the casino opened, there is a local like Arlin Baker, the town's retired florist, who stops by on Tuesday and Thursday afternoons after hunting to pick up the free cookie offered to those over 50. 
"Twenty-five-dollar cookie," clarified Mr. Baker, 63, referring to his losses on a recent visit. 
The casino, which opened in December, has already bought this town of 8,202 about 100 miles east of Kansas City new streetlights and repaved roads, along with the long-sought Thespian Hall restoration. The mayor insists she will not use the projected tax revenue from the casinos, nearly a third of Boonville's $15 million annual budget, for operating expenditures, but will save it for dream projects, like new sewer lines and a community center. 
More telling is the economic activity not directly connected to the casino, in a town where Toastmaster, the small appliance maker, and Atchison Products, a small luggage manufacturer, closed plants last year. Now, a developer is planning to turn the abandoned shoe factory into apartments. The state is renovating the landmark Ballantine House as an office building. 
On Main Street, where there are several new awnings and "above the store" apartments are rented for the first time in years, Snapp's Hardware has sold three lawn mowers, totaling $10,000, to casino customers from out of town and dozens of appliances to the 70 Isle of Capri supervisors who were transferred here. 
The casino is the largest employer not just in Boonville, but in surrounding Cooper County, with jobs ranging from $7-an-hour housekeepers to $35,000-a-year pit bosses; almost everyone gets benefits. 
Dean Smith, 65, retired from the lumber business and earns $10 an hour as a slot attendant, paying jackpots like the $4,500 that Floyd Kronk won on the Triple Diamond Deluxe the other night. 
Robyn Watson, 40, sold her convenience store in nearby Jamestown, trading 16-hour days for a shift at the bar that she hopes will lead to travel when the company opens another casino. For health insurance and $100 a day, Denice Haile drives 75 minutes each way from Jefferson City to walk among the gambling tables offering cocktails. 
"I'm starting over and they're giving me this opportunity to be able to take care of myself," said Ms. Haile, who is newly divorced and has children ages 15, 6 and 4. 
About half the players come from Boonville and neighboring villages, but others travel on buses from Kansas City and St. Louis, favoring the small size and safety here to the busier casinos in their hometowns. This summer, the Isle hopes to fill its tables with vacationers from the Lake of the Ozarks, 67 miles away, and Branson, Mo., the theater and country music magnet that is building a convention center. 
As the sun falls, the senior citizens who sit tethered to the slot machines all day are replaced by students from the University of Missouri in Columbia, 27 miles away, and professionals from Jefferson City. After the bars close at 2 a.m., there is often a little influx. 
Renee Cosner, 39, a casino hostess, strolls the aisles, greeting gamblers, picking up trash and straightening stools. Nowadays, wherever she goes, people know where she is from. 
"When you're in here," said Ms. Cosner, a lifelong resident, "you don't feel like you're in Boonville."

HEADLINE: A Fierce Race Leaves Deep Bruises in Newark 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW JACOBS 

DATELINE: NEWARK, May 19 

 BODY:
Whether saint or robber baron, Cory Booker and his high-octane but unsuccessful campaign against this city's four-term incumbent mayor, Sharpe James, has shaken Newark more than any single event since Kenneth Gibson became the first black mayor here 32 years ago. It has also left behind a wake of clashing sentiments: anger and disappointment for some, joy and relief for others.
 The race, which pitted Mr. James, a hard-nosed survivor of urban America's tumultuous past, against Mr. Booker, a privileged child of the integrated suburbs, unexpectedly exposed racial and cultural rifts in an increasingly diverse but stubbornly divided city, the state's largest. 
 For the legions of Booker believers -- some 47 percent of the electorate was willing to give him a shot -- Mayor James's campaign, backed by a formidable political machine, unfairly vilified a man who was poised to usher in an era of new ideas, energy and prosperity. "I feel like we've been set back," said Crystal Bayyane, 34, an unemployed executive assistant who said she voted last Tuesday for the first time in her life. "The whole city is going to suffer." 
But for the 53 percent of voters who delivered Mr. James to a record fifth term, the outcome vindicated a belief among many that Mr. Booker, 33, would have swept away a homegrown administration that, while imperfect, had at least earned the right to preside over Newark's long-awaited recovery. "We didn't struggle for so many years just to have some rich kid and his friends ride into town and take over City Hall," said Manfred Jackson, 71, a retired factory worker who bitterly recalled the years after the 1967 riots, when mass abandonment by the middle class gave way to decades of economic and social turmoil. "Where were they when the National Guard was shooting us down in the streets? Where were they when nobody wanted to step foot in Newark?"
Like many James supporters, Marcus Roper, 65, felt insulted by Mr. Booker's out-of-town donors, the visible contingent of white volunteers and the candidate's own storybook origins, which included an education at Stanford, Yale and Oxford and a childhood in affluent Bergen County. "He has no respect for us; he thinks we're stupid," Mr. Roper said, noting how Mr. Booker's campaign ads highlighted the city's shortcomings. "It's the Caucasian establishment saying a Rhodes scholar is better than our Sharpe James."
The mayor, 66, deftly turned his opponent's origins into a liability. His campaign punch line, "The Real Deal," suggested that Mr. Booker was somehow inauthentic, a theme that was expanded in speeches and in literature, and through strategists and allies. Mr. James continually questioned his rival's Democratic credentials, citing past associations with Republican officials and a talk he once gave at a conservative policy institute. At one event, the mayor mocked Mr. Booker for not being black enough.
Ronald Lester, a pollster for the James campaign, described the election not as a struggle between races or generations but as a war between "outsider and insider interests." Mr. Lester, who has worked for the biggest names in the Democratic Party, including Gov. James E. McGreevey and Bill Clinton, said he believed Mr. Booker and his supporters were not enlightened do-gooders but carpetbaggers eager to seize a city ripe with unrealized potential. "The land in Newark is so valuable because of where it sits, at the nexus of transportation routes and so close to Manhattan," he said. "It's not only valuable property, but it's pivotal in statewide politics."
While Mr. Booker's supporters brushed off such sentiments as paranoia, those ideas found fertile ground in a community long distrustful of outsiders. Even voters who were drawn to the Booker campaign's central message, "It's time for a change," expressed unease with his Ivy League associates and the fact that he arrived here only six years ago. 
Some refused to believe that Mr. Booker's intentions were as benevolent as he claimed. Zykeeya Barnes, 23, who like nearly one out of 10 Newark residents is unemployed, said she took a risk and voted for Mr. Booker despite warnings from friends and family members. "They said he was going to move all the black people out and move all the whites in, that he was going to close down the public schools," Ms. Barnes said, standing in front of Brick Towers, the troubled housing complex where Mr. Booker also lives. "But I just decided he deserved a chance."
In the final analysis, familiarity and loyalty were powerful factors in Tuesday's outcome. While Newark, with 274,000 residents, may look like a big city, it often behaves like a small town. Anyone with any longevity can name someone who went to high school with Mr. James and nearly everyone knows someone who works in City Hall. In a place where jobs are hard to come by, devotion to Mr. James, who is the single biggest employer of local residents, is often seen as a matter of survival. 
Sam Brown Jr., 47, a custodian at a private school, had a simple answer for why he pulled the lever for Mr. James last week. The mayor, he said, had helped his wife get a janitorial job with the Board of Education. "Let's put it this way," he said. "If I didn't vote for him, I'd be sleeping on the couch tonight."
Many city employees said they were told they would lose their jobs under a Booker administration. Others said they were just frightened of change. Dan O'Flaherty, an economics professor at Columbia University and a Newark native who has been involved in local politics since the 1950's, said residents here have always been wary of change. "When you go to City Hall with a problem, you want to know there's someone there who went to school with your mother's cousin," he said. "The last thing you want is an outsider like Cory to bring in his own people."
Such reasoning is cold comfort to Mr. Booker's supporters, who feel that fear, ignorance and petty self-interest doomed his candidacy. Like many of those who voted for Mr. Booker, Louis Fernandes said it was the first time he and his friends had been excited about local politics. "Put it this way, I'm 31 and I've only known two mayors my whole life," said Mr. Fernandes, who lives in the East Ward, a largely Portuguese and Brazilian neighborhood that has always been aloof from City Hall. "We didn't care where he was from," said Mr. Fernandes, a pilot for Continental Airlines. "We just wanted a change."
Americo Seabra, 42, whose family owns restaurants and produce markets in the city, was one of the few prominent business leaders to back Mr. Booker openly. He said he was especially troubled by the well-orchestrated effort to turn Mr. Booker's background into a negative. "Here's someone who bettered himself and who came back to give," he said. "It's very upsetting that he was penalized for that." 
Then there was the notion that Mr. Booker, whose political promise was frequently touted by the news media, was using Newark to better his own career. To Ms. Bayyane, that argument was irrational. "What people fail to realize is if Cory wanted to go to higher office, he had to do good here," she said. "We would have benefited from his ambition. With his education and resume, he could have gone anywhere."
Even though Mr. James has said this will be his final term and Mr. Booker has vowed to run again in 2006, some wonder whether the campaign, with its attacks on Mr. Booker's authenticity, might deter an emerging generation of black leaders raised outside impoverished cities. Walter Fields, the former director of the N.A.A.C.P. in New Jersey, worries that Mr. Booker's defeat might chill the ardor of young black professionals who have been increasingly drawn to down-and-out cities. "If you want places like Newark to grow, you want the Cory Bookers of the world to become an active part of the city," he said. "To have black elected officials question his legitimacy, to have him penalized for his own success, that's the tragedy of this election."

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
A Tough Sale for WorldCom in Latin America

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
WorldCom, short on cash and intent on selling some of its international assets, could have trouble finding buyers because of problems at the company and in the industry, some analysts say.
 Most of the attention has been focused on two WorldCom units in Latin America: Embratel, a Brazilian long-distance carrier, and Avantel, a Mexican telecommunications company that competes with Telefonos de Mexico and AT&T's Alestra unit. WorldCom is also said to be considering selling United States assets that include wireless reselling operations and wireless spectrum properties. 
 "WorldCom indicated that these assets were worth approximately $2 billion," a Merrill Lynch analyst, Adam Quinton, said in a report. "This seems far too high to us." 
The effort to sell the foreign assets is a radical departure from the previous strategy of WorldCom, the United States' second-largest long- distance company, after AT&T, to strengthen its international businesses. WorldCom has an extensive set of foreign holdings, which include Internet backbone and data transmission assets. Just last year, WorldCom consolidated its entire Latin American activities into a single entity, WorldCom Latin America, with operations across the region. But that was before WorldCom's financial crisis. The company needs about $5 billion of new financing to honor its obligations with creditors.
In addition to Embratel in Brazil and Avantel in Mexico, WorldCom has operations in 11 other Latin American countries and Puerto Rico. Other assets in the region include Star One, a venture with the Societe Europeenne des Satellites that provides fast satellite Internet access; SkyTel, a paging company; and Proceda, an information-technology outsourcing company.
Embratel, which WorldCom's MCI unit acquired for $2.3 billion in the privatization of Brazil's telecommunications system in 1997, was once the jewel of WorldCom's international properties. But like other long-distance carriers around the world, Embratel has suffered from a decline in revenue as competitors gnawed at its once monopolistic domination of the market.
In the most recent quarter, Embratel's international long-distance revenue declined 22 percent from the period a year earlier because of price cuts and a sharp drop in calling between Argentina, which is mired in an economic crisis, and Brazil. The company lost $16 million in the quarter, or 5 cents a share.
WorldCom's controlling stake in Embratel is now estimated to be worth only $200 million to $300 million, according to analysts, in light of the Brazilian company's stock plunge of 60 percent the last year. But WorldCom would be fortunate to get even that amount for transferring control of Embratel to another company, said Tucker Grinnan, director of Latin American telecommunications research at Deutsche Bank.
For one thing, Brazilian regulations designed to avert the concentration of power in telecommunications among a few companies prevent WorldCom from selling its stake in Embratel until next year. So any deal would probably have to wait until mid-2003, or long after WorldCom's most pressing cash requirements need to be resolved.
Only three companies with large local telephone operations in Brazil -- Telefonica of Spain, Telemar Norte Leste and Brasil Telecom -- are thought to be interested in buying Embratel. Of those three, Telemar, because of a relatively high debt burden, and Brasil Telecom, which has shown interest in acquiring Intelig, an Embratel competitor, are thought to be out of the running.
That could leave Telefonica with the upper hand in negotiating a deal with WorldCom.
"Embratel is basically doomed in its current form," said Mr. Grinnan, the analyst at Deutsche Bank.
WorldCom, of course, may have already come to the same conclusion. Last year, the company maneuvered to remove Embratel from its financial results by transferring the rights to dividends and distributions of some of its Embratel stock to a Brazilian nonprofit educational institution called Institute Embratel 21.
Also uncertain are prospects for WorldCom's selling its stake in Avantel. WorldCom owns the Mexican long-distance carrier together with Citigroup, which inherited a controlling stake in Avantel after acquiring Grupo Financiero Banamex-Accival last year.
WorldCom denied reports in Mexico earlier this month that it was planning to sell Citigroup its stake in Avantel, which like Embratel also loses money. Another possibility, analysts said, is a merger of Avantel with its financially troubled competitor, Alestra.
But it is not clear how the companies would fare either as a merged entity or separately against their larger rival, Telefonos de Mexico. WorldCom has declined to provide details on exactly how it plans to go about shedding some of its international businesses.
"WorldCom management is continuing its review of our entire business, which obviously includes our investments in Latin America," said Bradford Burns, a spokesman. "It would be premature for us to speculate on what conclusions will be reached once the review is complete."

HEADLINE: A Quiet Attack on Women 

BYLINE:  By Elizabeth Warren; Elizabeth Warren is a professor at Harvard Law School.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass. 

 BODY:
Women's rights are suddenly at the center of the Congressional debate over the nation's bankruptcy laws -- but only in the most cynical and opportunistic way. After five years of enormous contributions and lobbying from the financial industry, Congress now stands ready to dismantle protection for families under the nation's bankruptcy code. Diverting attention from the harm rewriting the law would do to women, members of Congress have managed to turn an argument about financial affairs into a debate over abortion.
 Congressional negotiators are scheduled to meet Wednesday to see if they can reach a compromise on a bill that would make it harder for individuals to file for bankruptcy. At issue is a provision, included in the Senate's version but not in that of the House, that would prevent abortion opponents from declaring bankruptcy in order to avoid paying court fines and damages. If the negotiators can agree on a bill, President Bush is likely to sign it. 
 Banking and credit lobbyists have been trying to change the bankruptcy laws for years. The current bill was stuck in conference between the Senate and House until Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware -- where many banks and credit-card issuers are incorporated -- agreed to vote with Republicans on almost all the issues that were holding up the bill. But Mr. Biden also told his Democratic colleagues that he would support an amendment to stop abortion protesters from using bankruptcy protection to avoid damages they might otherwise have to pay for violating federal law in violent clinic protests.
Regardless of one's views of the amendment, the bill itself is unconscionable. If it becomes law, the economic effects on more than 1.2 million women each year will be devastating. Apparently many politicians believe they can remove the last safety net for families facing financial disaster (many of which are led by women) so long as they can find another highly visible issue that lets them proclaim their support for women.
In the past 20 years, bankruptcy filings for female-headed households have increased at more than double the rate of bankruptcies for comparable households with an adult male present. (Families with children are more economically vulnerable than those without, and since women keep the children more often in the case of divorce, more women are filing for bankruptcy.) Women -- married, divorced, widowed and single -- now outnumber men seeking bankruptcy protection by more than 300,000 a year. The more than one million women filing for bankruptcy protection this year will bring nearly two million children into bankruptcy court with them.
Most of these women will be in bankruptcy court for reasons beyond their control. More than 90 percent of women who file for bankruptcy have been hit by some combination of unemployment, medical bills and divorce. Women are more likely than men to seek bankruptcy in the aftermath of a divorce or a medical problem, though both men and women cite job problems as the biggest difficulty.
At the same time, 200,000 women will find themselves in bankruptcy court not as debtors but as creditors -- trying to collect alimony or child support from their ex-husbands. Traditionally, alimony and child support are nondischargeable, which means these debts must be repaid even if the ex-husband files for bankruptcy, because women and children, unlike commercial creditors who can choose their debtors, cannot charge their husbands or fathers a premium for being bad credit risks. 
Yet in the pending legislation, credit-card companies and car lenders have devised a number of ways to ensure that more of their debt, including interest and penalties, is made similarly sacrosanct and payable forever. This puts divorced women in direct competition with credit-card companies for some of an ex-husband's limited income.
Some 30 women's groups, from the National Organization for Women to Hadassah to the Y.W.C.A., have announced their opposition to this bill. Do politicians like Mr. Biden who support the bankruptcy bill believe they can give credit-card companies the right to elbow out women and children so long as they rally behind an issue like abortion? The message is unmistakable: On an economic issue that attracts millions of dollars of industry support, women have no real political importance.
Wednesday's meeting of the House-Senate conference is the final showdown. Will the credit industry's bankruptcy bill pass the conference? Or will it stall over the issue of abortion? If Senator Charles Schumer, who wrote the abortion provision in the Senate bill, holds his ground, he will do a great service to the women who have fought hard for their rights to access to abortion clinics. But if the amendment prevents the bill's passage, he will do an even greater service to hundreds of thousands of women trying to collect child support and to millions more who are trying to survive after financial disaster.
These women are not fighting a pro-life or pro-choice battle. They are just fighting to make it to the next payday.

HEADLINE: Taking the Russia Summit a Step Further 

BYLINE:  By Michael McFaul; Michael McFaul is a Hoover Institution fellow and professor of political science at Stanford University.

 BODY:
President Bush is poised to have a terrific trip on his first visit to Russia. He will sign an agreement with President Vladimir Putin that will eliminate thousands of nuclear weapons. He and Mr. Putin will celebrate a new, closer relationship between the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia, paving the way for an uneventful expansion of the alliance this fall. Mr. Bush will proclaim Russia a market economy and urge Russian integration into the West. Finally, Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin will make joint statements about their shared commitment to the war on terrorism. 
 The summit will be only a partial success, however, if Bush fails to push for greater democracy. Soviet, then Russian, democratization was indispensable in preparing all the achievements of the upcoming summit. Autocratic Russia opposed NATO, resisted arms control and suppressed markets. Democratic Russia has sought to join the West and cooperate with the United States. A return to dictatorship in Russia would quickly undermine all of these achievements. 
 Unfortunately, the trend in Russia is going away from democracy. Most worrying has been Mr. Putin's disregard for human rights in Chechnya. Russia must defend its borders and respond to terrorist acts, such as the attack, said to have been by Islamic fundamentalists, in Dagestan earlier this month. The conduct of the Russian armed forces and units of the Ministry of the Interior in Chechnya, however, does not serve these purposes. Russian tactics in Chechnya have been routinely inhumane, especially against civilians. These methods have inspired more fanaticism within Chechnya and made Russia less secure.
Mr. Putin also has silenced many of his critics. He and his surrogates have gone on the offensive against critical independent media outlets, seizing control of NTV -- the country's only national opposition network -- and threatening others. Through new laws and registration procedures, Mr. Putin's government has also limited the freedoms and powers of independent trade unions, political parties and nongovernmental organizations like the Glasnost Defense Foundation, the Socio-Ecological Union and the Russo-Chechen Friendship Society. The state security service has stepped up harassment of investigative journalists, human rights activists, environmental leaders and academics.
Mr. Putin has even weakened alternative power centers within the state. His so-called reform of the upper house of parliament, the Federation Council, has gravely weakened this once important check on presidential power. Most disturbing, as demonstrated by the recent election in Ingushetia, the Russian federal government has begun to manipulate elections by disqualifying front-running candidates deemed unacceptable. Even Mr. Putin's generally positive legal reforms are tainted by the selective application of the law for political purposes. 
In isolation, any one of the anti-democratic trends might not be cause for alarm. Taken as a whole, they cannot be ignored.
W hy should Mr. Bush or the American people care? First, the obvious: Democracy is a good system of government and one desired by Russians. In nationwide polls in 2000, 60 percent of respondents believed democracy was a very good or fairly good system of government for Russia, while only 24 percent portrayed it as fairly bad or very bad. Eighty-seven percent of Russians think it important to elect the country's leaders. Most Russians are not willing to take the trade of more order for less freedom. Nearly 80 percent believe the military should not rule Russia. 
Second, dictatorship is unlikely to help the economy. Russia needs a more effective state to sustain markets. There is no reason to assume, however, that an autocratic regime in Russia would be an effective state. Russia's last autocratic regime -- the Soviet Union -- produced neither an efficient state nor economic growth. In the post-communist world, the correlation between democracy and economic growth is robust. 
Third, an autocratic Russia will eventually threaten the United States. Such a Russia would depend on the military, the intelligence services and military industries to stay in power. Many in these sectors distrust the United States and seek to reassert Russian influence in Georgia, Ukraine and Central Asia; to sell nuclear technologies to Iran; and to increase weapon sales to Iraq. The negative impact of an antidemocratic Russia on American security interests would be direct. 
On his visit to Moscow, Mr. Bush must speak the truth about Russia's democratic backsliding. He needs particularly to speak about Chechnya, acknowledging that terrorists there must be stopped but emphasizing that not all Chechens are terrorists and the only road to peace and security in the Caucasus is political, not military. Second, if Mr. Bush truly values his relationship with Mr. Putin, then he should speak candidly about the democratic criteria for genuine partnership between our nations. Third, he must make a special effort to meet with those in Russia fighting for democracy and human rights.
Mr. Putin is not a dictator, and he wants Russia to become a thriving capitalist economy fully integrated into the West. Rhetorically, he also has championed democracy. This is why Mr. Bush's message in Moscow could have a significant impact. By emphasizing democratization, he could impress on Mr. Putin the urgency of moving in the right direction now.

HEADLINE: Impoverished East Timor Exults Over Independence 

BYLINE:  By JANE PERLEZ 

DATELINE: DILI, East Timor, Monday, May 20 

 BODY:
East Timor became the world's newest nation today, a miniature Pacific Ocean country born of centuries of colonization by the Portuguese, decades of occupation by Indonesia and nearly three years of United Nations governance, which ended at midnight Sunday.
 During an emotional ceremony in a dusty field attended by many thousands of people, the new leaders of this nation of 800,000 and an array of international figures, the national flag was carried into the arena by former guerrilla fighters who led the war of resistance against Indonesia. 
 The Indonesian president, Megawati Sukarnoputri, looked on stoically as East Timor's first president, Jose Alexandre Gusmao, who is known as Xanana and who was imprisoned by Indonesia for seven years, exhorted his impoverished citizens to make the best of their hard-won freedom.
"We gained our independence to improve our lives," said Mr. Gusmao, who addressed the crowd from an outdoor platform rigged from bamboo poles. "I remind everyone, especially the leaders: discipline to affirm our power, tolerance to affirm democracy, reconciliation to affirm unity." 
The presence of Mrs. Megawati, who had opposed East Timor's referendum for independence in 1999, was welcomed as a gesture of reconciliation. Mr. Gusmao accompanied her onto the platform, then clasped her hand, holding it aloft with his in a victory wave to the crowd. He diplomatically said that the "difficult relations" between Indonesia and East Timor belonged to history. 
In a passing moment of bitterness, the arrival of four Indonesian warships with her motorcade and more than 100 security guards for her short visit was described by the East Timorese as an excessive show of force.
Former President Clinton, who urged the United Nations to send a peacekeeping force to East Timor after the Indonesian Army backed rampaging militia members in September 1999, led the United States' delegation.
In a referendum organized by the United Nations on Aug. 13, 1999, 78 percent of the voters chose independence. The result, which Indonesia had not fully expected, was followed by the destruction of Dili, the seaside capital, and other areas by the pro-Indonesia militia as Indonesian soldiers who had been occupying East Timor either participated or looked on. By United Nations estimate, about a thousand people were killed during the violence.
Indonesia invaded East Timor in December 1975 after it was abandoned by Portugal, its colonial ruler, and annexed the territory. The occupation was particularly brutal. By 1979, the Indonesian government acknowledged, 120,000 people had been killed or died of disease.
East Timor will join the ranks of the world's poorest countries. The sandalwood that first attracted the Portuguese ran out years ago, and the coffee that used to fetch high prices faces stiff competition in the current market glut. In Dili, many people earn less than 55 cents a day.
The scars of neglect and the violent departure of Indonesian forces were still evident on this day of celebration. As tens of thousands of elaborately dressed people flocked to the midnight ceremony in the backs of trucks and on foot, they passed the burned hulks of buildings. But there were also signs of the United-Nations-fostered rebirth, with fresh white paint daubed on a few new hotels.
East Timor's economic future depends on offshore natural gas deposits. After contentious negotiations, the new government is set to sign a treaty today with Australia. Under the treaty, East Timor will receive 90 percent of the revenues from the deposits and Australia 10 percent.
But the revenue streams will not start for another three years, leaving East Timor with tremendous shortfalls as it embarks on an independent existence. When benefits from the gas do flow, there will be the potential for East Timor to become perhaps as comfortable as the richest regions of Indonesia. 
But the country will need international aid for years. Its choice of language, currency and telephone codes reflects the unusual degree of dependence on the outside world.
The official language is Portuguese, chosen by Mr. Gusmao in deference to Portugal's long stay in East Timor, even though only an estimated 5 percent of the people, most of them older, speak Portuguese. Many speak Indonesian, the language of the occupation. The local language is Tetum.
The official currency is the American dollar. The Australian telephone company, Telstra, runs the East Timor system.
A recent report by the United Nations Development Program described a country in deep poverty. Life expectancy is 57 years. Preventable diseases like malaria, respiratory tract infections and diarrhea are major killers. Maternal mortality is high, with 420 deaths for every 100,000 live births. Only 37 percent of people over age 15 in rural areas can read and write.
Because of these deficiencies, "The United Nations will stay," said Kofi Annan, the secretary general, in a short speech just before the United Nations flag was lowered Sunday night. "Your friends around the world will continue to help." 
The United Nations peacekeeping force, now numbering about 5,000 soldiers -- chiefly from Australia, Portugal, Japan and New Zealand -- will be phased out over 18 months to two years, Mr. Annan said. This will allow the fledgling East Timor Defense Force, currently consisting of 600 soldiers from the Falintil guerrilla movement, to grow. 
"I cannot emphasize enough that material and financial support for the full establishment of East Timor's police and military are essential and require urgent action," Mr. Annan said in a recent report to the Security Council.
At an international conference last week, donors pledged $360 million in development assistance over three years. Mr. Annan said the country's civilian needs are as big as its military ones. He said there was a desperate need for trained judges. 
Despite the difficulties ahead, the East Timorese were in high spirits on Sunday night. A fireworks display donated by the Thai and Chinese governments was a big hit. People from all the districts in the hinterland, some wearing feathered headgear and bearing swords, performed in a show produced by Australian public event specialists.
The day began with an outdoor Roman Catholic Mass offered by Bishop Carlo Belo, who together with the foreign minister, Jose Ramos-Horta, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996. 
"People are ready, they have been waiting for this moment," said Hugo M. Fernandes, the 30-year-old chief editor of Talitakum, a new weekly magazine. Respect for the past and an eye to the future was uppermost in everyone's mind, he said. "I think all 800,000 people will dedicate themselves to those who were killed or died during the struggle, not only for the 24 years of the Indonesians but the whole 500 years. Today is a commemoration for the very long story of East Timor."

HEADLINE: In Czar Peter's Capital, Putin Is Not as Great 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES 

DATELINE: ST. PETERSBURG, Russia, May 19 

 BODY:
In the Kremlin office of President Vladimir V. Putin hangs a portrait of the founder of this glorious, if faded, city, Mr. Putin's hometown and the object of his fierce pride.
 The founder, Peter the Great, was Russia's first imperial czar. But more than that, he was Russia's great Westernizer, the ruler who scoured Europe for the best of its culture and science, then made it Russia's own. 
 President Bush heads to Moscow this week for his first summit meeting there, one that his advisers call a historic start to Russia's integration with the West. Then Mr. Putin will bring Mr. Bush here for a weekend coda amid the faux-Venetian canals and sprawling palaces that Peter erected three centuries ago. 
The temptation to draw PeterPutin parallels is irresistible.
It is also baloney, says Lev Luriye, the dry, urbane columnist for the St. Petersburg newspaper Kommersant. "He's not a hero -- he's a functionary," Mr. Luriye said last week of Mr. Putin, between drags on a cigarette in one of the city's sophisticated bars. "His personal liberty is very limited. He has to do what he has to do."
Mr. Luriye is not knocking a native son. By breeding and experience, Mr. Putin may be the most Westernized leader in Russian history. And since Sept. 11, when Mr. Putin was the first world leader to offer President Bush sympathy and support, his desire to lash Russia's fortunes to Europe's has seemed unassailably clear.
But to Mr. Luriye and many others the story of this meeting is not Russia's romance with the West. It is the shotgun nature of the courtship.
Past summit meetings proceeded on the notion that the United States and Russia were equals, if only by virtue of their mutual ability to destroy the planet. This meeting strips away that fiction. The agenda for the talks, which are to begin on Thursday, is overwhelmingly an American one, not because Russia completely agrees with it, but because in Mr. Putin's shrewd judgment, it cannot afford not to.
The list includes nuclear arms cuts negotiated on American terms and an agreement to cooperate on a missile defense shield that the Russians have condemned. It contains a pledge to curb the spread of weapons of mass destruction to some countries, like Iran, where the White House has stated that Russia is part of the proliferation problem.
The American view, as espoused this month by one senior Bush administration diplomat, is that the summit meeting "really puts the Russian-U.S. relationship on a firm course of long-term partnership, even a long-term alliance."
"This could very well be the last summit whose success is measured by the achievement in arms-control agreements," the diplomat said. "Arms control will no longer be the be-all and end-all of these high-level meetings. This will shift to new security challenges, and increasingly to economic and political issues where our relationship is more and more based on cooperation."
Russian experts see the summit meeting through a different lens.
"For five centuries Russia never paid tribute to anybody," Anatoly I. Utkin, a foreign policy expert at the Institute for U.S.A.-Canada Studies in Moscow, said in an interview. "Now for the first time we became a minor partner. You are boss; we are partner. I would never have said it before September of last year."
Officially neither side would describe the state of the relationship so baldly. Russians are proud of their long history as a first-tier global power. To make it government policy that those days are over would be not only politically incorrect, but politically risky for Mr. Putin.
For their part, American officials are not trying to spare Russian sensibilities. A Washington elite schooled in the notion of a superpower rivalry is only now coming to grips with the idea that Russia has abandoned the cold war playing field. The same is true for most Americans over the age of 35.
But in the ranks of American academics who grind out the papers that shape White House policy, the view of 21st-century Russia is bleak and pitiless.
"There is nothing inevitable about Russia's comeback," Eugene B. Rumer, a senior fellow at the National Defense University's Institute for National Strategic Studies, wrote last year as part of a roundup of policy advice for the new Bush administration. "It will not bounce back from its troubles anytime soon. Its current decline may well continue indefinitely.
"The United States has to deal with a weak and retreating Russia whose residual international ambitions will usually exceed its capabilities and whose principal near-term challenge will be downsizing in a predictable, responsible manner."
That is an almost perfect precis of the White House approach to the talks this week, and to Mr. Putin's management of foreign policy.
After a decade of drift, the Kremlin has moved to slash the military, close needless bases in Cuba and Vietnam, and focus Russian interests on economic cooperation with Europe and the United States. 
In Moscow Mr. Putin will agree with Mr. Bush to pare some 4,000 warheads from a nuclear force that Russia cannot afford and has no need to maintain anyway.
Peter the Great explored Europe as the leader of a vigorous and expanding Russia. Mr. Putin seeks to anchor Russia in the West at what may be his nation's weakest period in three centuries, when its borders have shrunk to those of the 1700's and when it is surrounded by economic and military giants: China, Japan and a unifying Europe.
His policy has its risks. "There are real criticisms of Putin's policies at home," said Dmitri Trenin, a foreign policy expert at the Moscow Center of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. "But I think there's a recognition, not only in Putin's mind but in the minds of others, that there is now an essential asymmetry in the relationship, and you have to be realistic about it."
But no one should labor under the illusion that Mr. Putin views himself as the orderly steward of Russia's imperial decline. Mr. Putin is, after all, a Petersburger. 
St. Petersburg has seethed with frustration for 85 years now, since Lenin's Bolsheviks stormed the Winter Palace, seized control of government and unceremoniously moved the empire's capital to Moscow.
Whatever the Russian government's public posture, Mr. Putin and his subjects are seething over their country's new second-city status and are itching to recover lost glory.
A glance at St. Petersburg underscores that. Peter's imperial capital, founded 299 years ago on a frozen swamp near the Gulf of Finland, lost a million residents to disease and starvation during the Nazi siege in World War II. Its Soviet masters later left it to rot.
Mr. Putin has embraced this decrepit but unspoiled museum piece and its 4.8 million residents and now seems determined to turn it into a northern Paris or Venice. From Tony Blair to Gerhard Schroder and now George Bush, world leaders have been swept out of Moscow to the former Leningrad for entertainment.
Early in Mr. Putin's tenure, grandoise plans were floated to move Parliament here. That seems to have foundered, but talk is rampant that the Central Bank will relocate. And St. Petersburg has become Russia's chosen forum for international conferences, diplomatic spectaculars and global events, like the world hockey championships in 2000.
Word has it that Mr. Putin wants a resurrected St. Petersburg to serve once again as Russia's window on Europe, the engine of its integration into Western culture.
Mr. Luriye, the columnist, applauds Mr. Putin's vision but says his timing is off: Mr. Putin may think Russia is ready for the West, he says, but the democracy he is pursuing may not yet agree.
"It's like chess," he said. "We have to make this move now, because we have nothing else. But the real decision won't be made by Putin but by the average man in the street -- or by his son."

MEETINGS FROM MOSCOW TO ST. PETERSBURG
Highlights of the Putin-Bush Summit Talks This Week

NUCLEAR ARMS -- President Bush and President Vladimir V. Putin are to sign a treaty to winnow their nuclear arsenals by two-thirds in the next decade, from about 6,000 warheads each, to between 1,700 and 2,200. An important American provision, unsuccessfully contested by Russia, allows either side to store inactive nuclear warheads, which could be quickly remounted on launchers in case of a global crisis.

MISSILE DEFENSES -- The presidents are expected to agree to cooperate on developing a defense against ballistic missiles. That is a direct result of Washington's decision in December, much criticized by Russians and Europeans, to withdraw from the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.

LONG-TERM COOPERATION -- The men are to lay out a "strategic framework" for efforts to curb weapons proliferation and international terrorism and to address political instability in key regions. The document will also address closer economic relations and cultural exchanges.

OTHER FACETS -- More details are expected on cooperation in energy development and counter-terrorism. After the Moscow talks, Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin are to meet with university students and visit religious sites in St. Petersburg before Mr. Bush departs for France, the next leg of his tour.

HEADLINE: Arts Groups In New York Brace for Cuts In City Funds 

BYLINE:  By ROBIN POGREBIN 

 BODY:
When representatives of many of the large city-supported cultural institutions gathered for a news conference on Thursday to protest Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's proposed budget cuts, the speeches seemed more dutiful than fiery, and the auditorium at El Museo del Barrio was practically empty. 
 Only James A. Lebenthal, the municipal bond magnate who serves on the board of the Museum of the City of New York, managed to muster some passion in warning the 10 or so people in attendance, "You take away any part of the cultural life of this city and you strike at the very heart of what all public investment is supposed to do, and that is improve the quality of life." 
 Perhaps the city's cultural groups are finding it tough to get all worked up for a fight they seem largely resigned to losing, or maybe they are hoping to be rescued, at least to some extent, by the City Council, as they have been in past years. 
Typically this is the season of the dance in which the mayor cuts the cultural budget, and the City Council restores the funds. The budget is to be adopted June 5 and to take effect July 1. But with the city facing a deficit of nearly $5 billion and an almost entirely new roster of Council members learning the ropes of budget negotiations, this year may well be different. 
"We don't know if we're going to be able to do it the way we have in years past because we're facing such a shortfall," said Jose Serrano, a freshman councilman who heads the committee on culture and libraries.
In his preliminary budget, Mayor Bloomberg proposed cuts of $19.1 million to the Cultural Affairs Department. This breaks down to reductions of about 18 percent to the 34 members of the Cultural Institutions Group, institutions whose buildings or land is owned in part or whole by the city, and about 13 percent to the more than 500 institutions that are considered program groups. The Cultural Institutions Group includes the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Studio Museum in Harlem; among the program groups are the Museum of Modern Art, the Pan Asian Repertory Theater and the Queens Historical Society.
Mayor Bloomberg has asked the Cultural Affairs Department staff to cut its capital budget by $263 million over the next five years, down from the current $862 million. Over his eight years in office, former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani spent $487.7 million on capital cultural projects.
Everybody knows there is less money to go around. As the economy was turning down, the events of Sept. 11 drastically escalated the slump, and every city agency expects to be in for severe sacrifices. Mayor Bloomberg has proposed contingency cuts of $63 million from the Police Department, nearly $17 million from libraries and $10 million from the Sanitation Department.
"I'm having difficulty figuring out how the Council is going to restore funds to any constituency unless the question of revenues is resolved," said Norma P. Munn, chairwoman of the New York City Arts Coalition, a citywide advocacy group.
During most of his eight years in office, Mayor Giuliani proposed cuts for the members of the Cultural Institutions Group, but these cuts were restored by the Council in an almost ritualistic way that Mr. Giuliani foresaw and participated in. But Kate D. Levin, the city's commissioner of cultural affairs, said that given the severe projected budget shortfall, Mayor Bloomberg's budget proposal was real, not a starting point.
"We devised the cuts with the charge: If the music stops here, what would be the best way to allocate funding knowing we're facing a horrible fiscal crisis, and what can we do to help culturals sustain themselves in a very difficult period?" she said.
Mr. Bloomberg's would not be the first city administration to argue at the outset that there was no room for horse trading and then have to negotiate with the State Legislature. The City Council has already called for maximum cuts of only 2 percent, compared to Mr. Bloomberg's double-digit proposal. 
The mayor's proposed cuts "will severely impact the ability of cultural groups to provide services that are essential to who we are as a city," said Gifford Miller, the speaker of the City Council.
But the 2 percent cuts are dependent on tax revenues that are highly unlikely, budget experts say: City Council proposals to reinstate the commuter tax and impose a personal income tax surcharge. Mayor Bloomberg has said he would veto any budget that included tax increases, for fear they would drive New Yorkers out of the city, and a commuter tax would also have to go through the Legislature, where it is thought to be a virtual nonstarter. 
Meanwhile many cultural organizations are struggling with lower ticket sales because of the dramatic drop in tourists and reduced contributions from foundations, corporations and individuals. Many have cut staff, reduced programming or postponed construction plans.
David E. McKinney, president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said that attendance was still down 30 percent from last year, having dropped by 60 percent right after Sept. 11, largely because of the reduction of tourists from the West Coast, Europe and Japan. In the fiscal year 2001 the museum had 5 million visitors; attendance is expected to be down to 3.9 million for the fiscal year 2002, which ends in June. 
"It's a severe impact," Mr. McKinney said. "And we're expecting that to continue."
How much money will be available to the City Council after it negotiates with the mayor is one great unknown. Another is which services will be most successful in competing for whatever funds remain. Rather than proposing across-the-board cuts, the Cultural Affairs Department for the first time this year cut some organizations more than others, depending on their size and strength, Ms. Levin said. "The mayor wanted us to give particular consideration to the groups having the hardest time financially," she added.
At Thursday's news conference, officials of El Museo del Barrio said the proposed cuts would force their museum to lay off one-quarter of its guards, shut down its permanent Caribbean exhibition and close the institution one day a week.
Arts executives like Lowery Stokes Sims, director of the Studio Museum in Harlem, and Donna Walker-Kuhne, the director of community outreach and education initiatives at the Joseph Papp Public Theater, said the cuts are likely to hurt their education programs most. 
The city's cultural groups are stressing their importance to the economy of the city. They point out that the member organizations of the Cultural Institutions Group employ 11,000 people and last year brought 19 million visitors into their buildings. For every dollar the city spends on the arts, it collects $2 in tax receipts, said a study by the Alliance for the Arts, an advocacy group. 
Councilman Serrano said, "Cultural institutions are a core service for New York City because they are a fiscal engine." 
Ms. Levin said Mr. Bloomberg understood that. "The mayor values what the cultural sector does for New York very highly," she said. "The problem is, you can't wish away a $5 billion deficit."

HEADLINE: Bush Faces Pressure From Congress to Alter Cuba Policy 

BYLINE:  By CHRISTOPHER MARQUIS and ERIC SCHMITT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 19 

 BODY:
As President Bush heads to Miami on Monday to lay out tougher restrictions on travel to Cuba and lend support for government opponents there, a growing number of lawmakers from both parties are visiting the island on their own and demanding that the United States open it up to tourism and trade.
 Mr. Bush is personally and politically committed to a hard-line policy toward Cuba. In his speech on Monday, he will condition any easing of this policy on Cuba's adoption of democratic reforms, such as freeing all political prisoners and giving opposition parties the freedom to organize and speak. 
 In excerpts released by the White House on Sunday night, Mr. Bush laid out specific conditions that also included allowing outside observers to monitor the 2003 assembly elections and giving human rights organizations access to the country.
His appearance at a lavish fund-raiser of Cuban-Americans who support continued pressure against Havana will be a reminder of this group's pivotal role in the president's victory in 2000, and a vivid example of where domestic politics and foreign policy intersect.
But after decades in which the forces for isolating Cuba have dominated the policy, a new crop of lawmakers have demanded change. Advocates say that a majority in the House and Senate favor lifting the travel ban, but that the House Republican leadership has stymied any action. Farm groups, with substantial Republican support in Congress, are the most important growing organized constituency pressing to open lucrative overseas markets to American agriculture.
"For the first time, we have a debate on this when there may be a real balance of forces," said Lisandro Perez, a sociologist at Florida International University and a critic of the current American policy.
On Capitol Hill, Cuba is no longer a partisan issue with Republicans generally urging strict measures and Democrats advocating an end to them. Now, Midwestern Republicans have joined Northeastern Democrats to challenge the sanctions on trade and travel, and to call for a new approach in dealing with Havana.
"I'm with the president 95 percent of the time, but not on this one," said Representative Tom Osborne, a Nebraska Republican and former University of Nebraska football coach. "After 40 years, let's not just keep running up the middle. Let's throw a pass. Let's try something different."
But hard-liners say loosening the pressure now would be a mistake. Jaime Suchlicki, the director of the Institute for Cuban and Cuban American Studies at the University of Miami, said that a cash infusion would give new life to Fidel Castro's government and that farm-state lawmakers were undercutting the president by trying to strip him of his ability to punish rogue regimes.
Arguments that tourism and greater engagement would help open up Cuba, Mr. Suchlicki said, "are at best naive and at worst hypocritical." He added: "They see Cuba as a bonanza, which it's not. Cuba is bankrupt."
Former President Jimmy Carter's call for easing sanctions against Cuba during a visit there last week elevated this running debate, and was groundbreaking on several other levels, said Jorge Dominguez, a Cuba expert and professor of government at Harvard.
"He compelled the Cuban government, and Fidel in particular, to recognize the opposition," Mr. Dominguez said. "He got to have his remarks in Spanish broadcast over Cuban national television. Only the pope has had that opportunity."
Cuba policy takes on added importance because of its political implications in Florida, where President Bush's brother, Gov. Jeb Bush, is running for his second term and has relied on the strongly Republican Cuban-American vote. In recent years, Florida has emerged as a crucial swing state, magnifying the importance of Cuban-Americans, who represent only about 5 percent of the state's electorate.
Al Cardenas, the chairman of the Republican Party in Florida, said Cuban-American support for President Bush had increased to about 80 percent since he took office.
But Cuban-Americans are no longer united in their stance toward Cuba. Sergio Bendixen, a Miami pollster who tracks Hispanic issues, said that slightly more than half of Cuban-Americans in South Florida arrived since the early 1980's, and that they supported a more moderate policy. But their political influence is eclipsed by those who arrived in the 1960's and 70's, who generally take a much harder line and make up 70 percent of the Cuban-American electorate, Mr. Bendixen said.
"The challenge for the president will be not only to make hard-liners happy, but also hang onto a significant chunk who want more moderation," Mr. Bendixen said.
The tone and content of the Cuba policy debate are evolving. A decade ago, Cuban-American lawmakers, their allies and a well-financed lobby blocked discussion of engagement by questioning the anti-Communist credentials of the policy critics. Now, with the cold war a fading memory, the forces for engagement are demanding to know why the United States pursues trade or political dialogue with authoritarian states like China, but not Cuba.
A growing number of lawmakers are traveling to Cuba. This year, two Republican senators, Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island, dined with Mr. Castro and crossed paths with a bipartisan group of six House members.
"There's no question that Congress is moving toward a different policy with Cuba based on the reality that the current policy is outdated and irrelevant," said Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska.
Nonetheless, there is a growing sense among Democratic critics that some members of the Bush administration are using the possibility of a new national security threat to blunt calls for improved relations with Cuba. John R. Bolton, the undersecretary of state for arms control, this month accused Cuba of developing biological weapons; both Secretary of State Colin L. Powell and Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld distanced themselves from the charge.
Senator Christopher J. Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat who heads a Western Hemisphere subcommittee, announced hearings for this week to "review discrepancies" among administration officials on Cuba's ability to produce biological weapons.
Lawmakers on both sides of the debate said they faced an uphill struggle. There are enough votes in the House and Senate to lift the travel ban, advocates say. But the House leadership has twice blocked majorities seeking to open Cuba to travel. Even if supporters of change could muster enough votes, however, any easing of sanctions is likely to face a presidential veto.
"We're butting heads with the administration on this," said Representative John Thune of South Dakota, whom the White House has championed as the Republican candidate in the state's hotly contested Senate race this fall. "But we'll keep applying the pressure."

HEADLINE: New Jellyfish Problem Means Jellyfish Are Not the Only Problem 

BYLINE:  By OTTO POHL 

DATELINE: PORT DOUGLAS, Australia 

 BODY:
When Robert King climbed back on the boat after snorkeling off the Great Barrier Reef here on March 31, he knew something was wrong. "I don't feel so good," he said, rubbing his chest. 
 He had been stung by a jellyfish, and his condition deteriorated rapidly. By the time the emergency helicopter arrived, he was screaming in agony; a few hours later he was in a coma, eyes frozen wide, bleeding into his brain. He never regained consciousness. 
 Mr. King, 44, from Columbus, Ohio, was the second person in Australia to die this year from the sting of a species of jellyfish, Carukia barnesi, found only in Australia and never before known to be fatal. More than 200 other victims went to hospitals, several times the number in a normal summer season here.
In many places around the world, jellyfish populations are sharply increasing, stinging more people and wreaking economic damage. While in some areas the increase appears to be part of a natural cycle (jellyfish populations are declining in some other areas), scientists have noticed an overall upward trend. And they suspect that human activity is to blame.
"Jellies are a pretty good group of animals to track coastal ecosystems," said Dr. Monty Graham, a jellyfish scientist at the University of South Alabama. "When you start to see jellyfish numbers grow and grow, that usually indicates a stressed system."
Those stresses include increased water temperature, a rise in nutrients in the water and depleted stocks of other fish, all of them often caused by humans.
Higher nutrient levels in the water, which tend to support larger populations of jellyfish, can result from runoff of fertilizer and sewage. Overfishing removes the jellyfish's main competitor for food. 
Debate continues about the rising water temperatures worldwide and whether they result, at least partly, from global warming -- the greenhouse effect caused by the burning of fossil fuel. Being mostly water, jellyfish react strongly and quickly to all of these changes. In a sense, the jellyfish is like the pigeon in today's cities, able to flourish in environments distorted by humans while other species cannot survive at all. 
Distinctly unlike the pigeon, however, jellyfish release millions of microscopic harpoons when touched, shooting tiny hypodermic needles into a victim's skin. They are lined with barbs and filled with venom, and they often linger painfully in the skin for months after the toxin has worn off. 
That experience is becoming more common around the world. On Waikiki Beach in Hawaii, for example, a lifeguard, Landy Blair, counted more than 900 stings on a single day this season, about 1 percent of them sending victims to hospitals. Mr. Blair has been keeping track of jellyfish populations near the beach since 1991. The problem has grown steadily worse, he said, adding, "We have seen the highest numbers ever over the past year."
On the beaches near Auckland, New Zealand, half a dozen sting victims have required hospitalization this year, Robert Ferguson of Surf Life Saving New Zealand, a lifeguard group, reported. "It's the first time I've ever heard of victims needing hospital care," Mr. Ferguson said. "This is a new type of jellyfish with stings that are much more severe, much harsher."
The situation is the same in Australia. "This year is incredibly abnormal," said Dr. Jamie Seymour, a jellyfish expert at James Cook University. He believes that strong, unusual wind patterns help blow the jellyfish toward the shore, where they flourish in unseasonably warm waters. Dr. Seymour, who has analyzed the venom from each sting that receives hospital treatment in the Barrier Reef region for years, had never seen the type of venom that killed the two tourists this year. 
Dr. Seymour believes that the enormous increase of jellyfish near the shore has brought rarer, more deadly subspecies into contact with humans for the first time.
Booming jellyfish populations can also take a high economic toll. In the Gulf of Mexico, shrimp fishermen are struggling with a jellyfish boom that fills nets with slimy gelatin and financial ledgers with millions of dollars in losses.
While populations appear to be down this year, Dr. Graham, of South Alabama, sees a "statistically solid increase" in the region over the longer term.
Jellyfish first gained major scientific attention in the 1980's, when a huge jellyfish bloom devastated the Black Sea, an ecosystem already weakened by overfishing of anchovies. Scientists believe that the jellyfish, an Atlantic native named Mnemiopsis leidyi, hitched a ride on the bottom of a ship and then rapidly multiplied, feeding on anchovy eggs and the plankton that young fish rely on. 
More recently in Hawaii, overfishing of stocks like ahi and mahi-mahi -- as well as a depletion of sea turtle populations, another predator of the jellyfish -- is partly responsible for the jellyfish boom there, said Dr. Angel Yanagihara, who heads a jellyfish research laboratory at the University of Hawaii. For her, jellyfish blooms are simply responses to the stresses that humans have put on the environment. "It's a wake-up call by nature," Dr. Yanagihara said.
Australia was stunned into action by the two deaths, which officials fear could hurt tourism. "No one cared until someone died," said Dr. Seymour, a member of a hastily convened commission. 
At the same time, some here see the jellyfish boom as an opportunity. The Queensland Fisheries Service, intrigued that Australian waters are so hospitable to jellyfish, is considering setting up a commercial fishing operation for the edible jellyfish Catostylus mosaicus. That fish is popular in many Asian countries, but it is declining in Asian waters, probably because of pollution. 
Dr. Seymour said people could eat the highly venomous box jellyfish if they cut the tentacles off, although he remains fairly unimpressed with jellyfish as a food source. "They basically taste like whatever sauce they've got on them," he said.

HEADLINE: THEATER REVIEWS; 
Turning a Farce on Its Head Despite Proper Ingredients

BYLINE:  By BEN BRANTLEY 

 BODY:
These are some of the ingredients in Mike Leigh's recipe for a perfectly tart comedy: eight doors, six closets (each large enough to contain a single average-size human being), one gun, one giant bed and five clueless souls, including a pretty girl in a very short skirt.
 And what does all this add up to? A farce so classic that it groans with familiarity, right? 
 Nope. With Mr. Leigh, the acclaimed British filmmaker ("Secrets and Lies," "Topsy-Turvy"), doing the calculations, the sum effect is something much more subversive. Mr. Leigh calls it anti-farce. This does not discount its being one of the brightest and most stimulating shows to be seen in Manhattan in many a month. 
The play, which opened recently at the Samuel Beckett Theater in a New Group production, is titled "Smelling a Rat." But as confidently staged by Scott Elliott -- with a nigh flawless five-member cast that includes a comely young television star (Michelle Williams of "Dawson's Creek") -- this shrewd, sure-footed work gives off a much fresher aroma. For theatergoers who have sat through an exceptionally bloated and desperate-feeling Broadway season, "Smelling a Rat" has the scent of deliverance.
Though the work has a welcome aura of spring, "Rat" is not a new play. You could even call it a period piece of sorts. It was written in the late 1980's. And like the Leigh films of that time, "High Hopes" and "Life Is Sweet," it both bears and chafes beneath the materialist imprint of Margaret Thatcher's Britain.
But don't think for a second you're in for windy propaganda. The characters in "Rat," a tale of two exhausting hours in the Christmas holiday of an exterminator named Rex Weasel, may talk incessantly. Mr. Leigh, however, refrains from all obvious speechifying.
What he does instead is create a self-contained world, crammed with supply-side luxuries and references to overindulgence, that suffocates on its own conventions. Similarly, "Rat" sets you up for a merry knockabout farce and then deliberately never delivers one. It's like a firecracker with a very long fuse that never explodes and yet is somehow more entertaining than if it did.
The tone for this exercise in deflation is established with wonderful precision. Kevin Price's set, the bedroom of Mr. Weasel's London apartment, is scathingly realistic and a sight gag at the same time: a vision of overwhelming although organized clutter that embraces everything from rows of cosmetic and pill bottles to an immense army of stuffed animals.
Despite such evidence of human existence, the room looks sterile and unlived-in. It seems almost a violation when a man with a suitcase enters. That's Rex Weasel (Terence Rigby), whose systematic, silent unpacking occupies the play's opening moments. The activity is intermittently accompanied by the kind of goofy, suspenseful melody (by Tom Kochan) associated with animated children's cartoons.
This wordless preface is a deliciously sustained tease; it seems to presage some wild eruption into chaos, a feeling confirmed when Rex hears voices and slips into one of his six built-in closets. Enter Vic Maggott (Brian F. O'Byrne), an employee of Rex's Vermination pest control company, and his wife Charmaine (Gillian Foss), who are checking up on the boss's lair, since Rex is supposed to be on vacation.
Vic and Charmaine, in turn, are driven into hiding in two other closets with the arrival of Rock (Eddie Kaye Thomas), Rex's taciturn son, and his date, the giggly Melanie-Jane Beetles (Ms. Williams). Though neither retreats to a closet, Melanie-Jane does spend a long spell locked in the bathroom.
And there you have the structure of "Smelling a Rat," a comic edifice that in theory should house all sorts of frantic antics. Think of those promising verminlike last names (Weasel, Maggott, Beetles), latter-day answers to the nomenclature of Restoration comedy. But in truth any activity is of a very mild order.
People scream when they discover one another hiding, yes, but the hysteria soon subsides. Rex turns out to have a gun, but he doesn't use it. The two couples roll a bit on the bed, but rolling is the extent of it. Much comment is made upon assorted objects (the stuffed animals, the bidet in the bathroom), but they aren't put to use. "Rat" is all foreplay and no follow-through; tons of talk and little action.
And therein lies the play's comic and satiric genius. In depicting a world swamped by idle possessions and empty words, in which anticipated collisions and connections never occur, the play generates a delirious energy that is all the funnier for coming to naught.
The dialogue is made up largely of cliches, arranged in dazzling series of non sequiturs; misplaced fancy locutions (Vic favors "inasmuch"), brand names and precise and valueless descriptions of things like the placemat (a souvenir of Stratford-Upon-Avon) with which Melanie-Jane recalls once being hit. Every so often more solemn suggestions of domestic displacement and loneliness peek through.
The cast members, attired in Eric Becker's mercilessly accurate 1980's-style clothes, are all priceless. If just one of them crossed the line into sitcom caricature, the evening would be spoiled. But they bring unblinking conviction to their characters' absurdity.
Mr. O'Byrne (of "The Beauty Queen of Leenane") and Ms. Foss give devastatingly accurate readings to the jittery, silence-filling patter of a long-married couple. Mr. Thomas (of the "American Pie" films) does wonders with Rock's ominous silences, contrasted by Mr. Rigby's Colonel Blimp-ish bluster.
Ms. Williams's sexually ambivalent Melanie-Jane is every manic boy-teaser one remembers from high school. And her faltering, high-heeled walk, an awkward combination of a mince and a march, becomes a blissful metaphor for the unwitting gracelessness of all the characters.
Mr. Elliott, represented on Broadway this season with the revival of "The Women," does his best work in years here. As the artistic director of the New Group, he made the company's reputation with Mr. Leigh's "Ecstasy" in 1995, and he seems to have a bone-deep affinity for this playwright. Mr. Elliott brings both surgical exactness and dizzy spontaneity to "Rat." Every detail in the performances is resonantly telling and yet organic feeling. This combination isn't easy to come by, as the unevenness of most current productions on Broadway testify.
"Smelling a Rat" may portray a world in which the dots are never connected. But the production hums with the subliminal music of each and every element clicking smoothly into place. What a rare and satisfying sound that is.

Re "Drugs, Terror and Tuna: How Goals Clash" (front page, May 16):
 You report that among leaders of the Philippines' tuna industry in General Santos City, "resentment is running high over trade legislation now on the Senate floor in Washington. 
The bill includes a provision to eliminate steep import taxes on canned tuna from Andean nations while keeping taxes in place for other countries like the Philippines." 
 I was a Peace Corps volunteer in the Philippines in the 1960's assigned to a small town north of General Santos City. I often took the long, dusty bus ride over unpaved road from my landlocked town to visit this port city.
General Santos City is a cultural chasm away from Manila. The area was all but ignored in the Ferdinand Marcos era, fueling a simmering insurgency. We must do everything we can to help President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo maintain the area's economic stability.

HEADLINE: Quandary on Trade 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: GENERAL SANTOS CITY, the Philippines, May 16 

 BODY:
How should the United States set its tariffs and trade rules, globally or country-by-country?
 It is no arid academic debate to the tuna fishermen of this knockabout port city on the south coast of Mindanao, nor to sugar cutters in the Caribbean or garment workers in Pakistan. Faraway changes in American fine print can have very real, sometimes unintended consequences. 
 A move in Congress to extend trade preferences to Andean nations, in part to help wean their economies off coca production, could lead to the layoff of thousands of Muslim workers in the tuna industry here, even as American troops help the Philippine army fight Abu Sayyaf Muslim insurgents in this region. 
In Pakistan, officials have struggled to win a larger quota for textile shipments to the United States as a reward for Islamabad's help during the conflict in Afghanistan. And in the Caribbean, the emergence of any especially pro-American government brings a request for a larger quota to ship sugar to the high-priced, highly protected American market.
By returning to the pre-1922 practice of awarding preferential trade treatment to certain countries and regions, often for political rather than economic reasons, Washington now finds itself constantly badgered for trade concessions by whatever friendly nation is in the news at any given moment.
This is the problem that "most favored nation" status was supposed to solve. When countries won that status -- as nearly all of America's trading partners did in recent decades -- they were assured that their exports would get the same tariff treatment as any other, and that generally, concessions awarded to one would be awarded to all. 
After the ruinous bilateral trade competition in Europe in the 1930's, the United States backed a global adoption of the same approach, leading in the decades after World War II to the international trade rules enshrined in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and later to the creation of the World Trade Organization.
"The history of trade negotiations basically was that, because of the bilateral special deals that inevitably made other nations unhappy, we came around to most-favored-nation treatment and GATT negotiations," said William Cline, a senior economist at the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
Up through the 1980's, most economists criticized regional trade agreements as just as bad as bilateral deals. Beyond making winners of some countries and losers of others, regional blocs can be bad for global efficiency, by prompting importers to favor a higher-cost producer within the bloc over a lower-cost producer outside whose goods are still subject to high tariffs and quotas.
Global trade agreements minimize such drawbacks, because these days very few countries remain outside them. But global treaties are becoming increasingly difficult to conclude. The last was wrapped up in Geneva in 1993; talks meant to produce the next one did not get under way until last November in Doha, Qatar, and are expected to take years.
But the regional free trade concept has become fashionable again, in great part because of the success of the European Union, which hugely increased trade among its 15 members by eliminating tariffs and trade barriers. It helped inspire the 1992 North American Free Trade Agreement -- joining the United States, Canada and Mexico -- as well as several other regional groupings. 
One provision of the Nafta treaty helped set off the dispute now roiling American efforts to retain the support of the Philippines in the war on terrorism.
Among the tariffs to be eliminated within North America by the treaty is the American duty on canned tuna imported from Mexico. It will not disappear until 2008, and for the moment it means little because Mexico, well north of the equatorial waters where the best fishing grounds are found, has a tiny tuna industry. But tuna from other countries is subject to duty of up to 35 percent, creating a big incentive for Mexico to build up its tuna fleet, despite the high labor and fuel costs for the long journeys to where the tuna swim.
Several smaller Central American and Caribbean nations also have small tuna fleets; three years ago, Congress agreed to phase out tuna duties for them on the same timetable.
To the Andean nations of South America, these concessions posed a serious threat -- that preferential access to the United States would soon make big new competitors out of Mexico and Central America. The United States had lowered tariffs on many products from Andean nations like Ecuador and Colombia in 1991, but canned tuna was not among them. When the 1991 concessions came up for renewal last year, the Andean nations, supported by Starkist, demanded that they be expanded to include canned tuna.
Ecuador has a huge tuna fishing fleet, and Colombia a smaller one; both countries are eager to create jobs that do not depend on narcotics trafficking. That persuaded the House of Representatives to approve a bill earlier this year that would immediately eliminate duty on Andean tuna.
A more limited bill that would phase out duty on about a third of current shipments is before the Senate as part of a broader trade bill. If it passes, differences between the provisions would be worked out in a conference of senators and representatives.
Now it is the Philippines' turn to feel threatened. Letting Ecuador and Colombia, but not the Philippines, ship tuna to the United States duty free would be both unfair and unwise, officials in Manila are warning, because of the hardship it would create in this poor, Muslim and sometimes rebellious part of the country, where terrorists are believed to be active. "We understand you want to do this because of narcotics," said Manuel A. Roxas II, the country's secretary of trade and industry, "but terrorism is just as important." 
Washington has been on notice for some time that this kind of chain reaction of anger and demands for relief was likely to develop. An influential report by the United States Tariff Commission foresaw that special deals for some countries would "lead to claims from states outside the agreement which, if granted, defeat the purpose of the treaties, and which, if not granted, occasion the preferring of a charge of disloyalty to treaty obligations."
The report was published in 1919.

HEADLINE: Man and Craft Were One, As a New Age Began 

BYLINE:  By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

 BODY:
A man seized by a memory of the boy who built model airplanes, the dreamy whiff of glue and banana oil lingering in imagination, casts an appraising eye over the well-made fuselage and wing. With more ambition and a bigger X-acto knife -- also something sturdier than balsa wood -- he just might have constructed the airplane he sees hanging from the ceiling of the National Air and Space Museum in Washington.
 The former model builder studies the Spirit of St. Louis in its aging glory. The cotton fabric coated with aluminum-pigmented dope is still stretched tight over the wing and the rear fuselage. The lines of skeletal wood spars and ribs show through, as his did through tissue paper. Yes, it is a scaled-up version of the scaled-down planes he put together between school work and important things like baseball and the Saturday cowboy matinee. 
 How could an airplane like this, its design so rudimentary that a fanciful model builder can imagine his own hand in the work, have flown all the way from New York to Paris? 
 Those who look at the Spirit of St. Louis in the museum are seeing an artifact from a time when human beings were on more intimate terms with their technology. Their machines still seemed understandable as evolved extensions of ordinary human abilities.
It was a time when the written words from typewriters seemed closer to the cuneiform tablets of Mesopotamia than to today's electronic machines, and the telephone was simply conversation carried beyond the backyard fence, nothing remotely comparable to the voluminous bytes of modern telecommunications. Airplanes in those days were built and flown by people who knew the throb of their engines like their own heartbeats.
The Spirit of St. Louis, in any event, was sufficient to its task, where others had failed. Seventy-five years ago today, Charles A. Lindbergh, alone in a stiff wicker seat in the little plane's cramped cockpit, completed the first nonstop flight across the Atlantic Ocean to the European continent. The flight established a benchmark in human courage and aviation history.
A tall 25-year-old aviator known as Slim, Lindbergh had taken off the morning before from Roosevelt Field, outside New York City on Long Island. Through daylight and dark, fog and sleet and gathering clouds of fatigue, he flew 33 hours 30 minutes and covered 3,610 miles. After dark on May 21, 1927, he landed at Le Bourget Field to the wild cheers of the French crowd.
"Well, I made it," Lindbergh said from the cockpit, dazed from exhaustion and by the acclaim. He flashed the boyish smile that charmed the world. Slim, who had previously flown the mail between St. Louis and Chicago, was now Lucky Lindy or the Lone Eagle.
Only 24 years earlier, in 1903, the brothers Orville and Wilbur Wright had coaxed a fragile plane into the air, ever so briefly.
They were bicycle mechanics from Ohio who saw in the principles of bicycles and kites the makings of a flying machine. Their plane, its two wings resembling a box kite with two propellers, rose over the dunes of Kitty Hawk, on the Outer Banks of North Carolina, climbing unsteadily to 120 feet and staying airborne only 12 seconds.
It was a beginning, the first time a machine carrying a human had powered itself into the air.
Now, after years of barnstorming at country fairs, wing-walking antics and some serious business of aerial reconnaissance and combat in World War I, flying was about to become global.
In a blink of history's eye, flying machines would become bewilderingly complex, even supersonic, each capable of carrying hundreds of people across oceans in a few hours and around the world, but not without superhuman computers. On any given day now, some 25 wide-body airplanes with jet engines take off from New York and fly 250 to 375 passengers each direct to Paris, just a cocktail, dinner and long nap away.
"Lindbergh put the spotlight on aviation as never before," Dr. F. Robert van der Linden, a historian and curator at the National Air and Space Museum, said while showing a visitor the airplane that made the flight. "All of a sudden, you saw people pouring millions of dollars into aviation investments, and in the 1930's passenger service to Europe would start."
The historian Daniel Boorstin has written that Lindbergh "performed single-handed one of the heroic deeds of the century." For the rest of his life, through fanfare and tragedy and reverberating political controversy over pro-Nazi statements, Lindbergh knew the rewards and burdens of a hero. He died in 1974.
With becoming modesty and a good deal of accuracy, Lindbergh always shared credit for the achievement with his airplane. For a critical period, the two were inseparable. He recommended the design specifications and oversaw each step in the plane's assembly. He took it on all the test flights.
In fact, he was the only pilot the plane ever had, before and after its historic flight. Lindbergh referred to himself and the plane as "we." This was the succinct title of his first book, published in July after the flight. It reflected a deep bond between the two, the lost intimacy between humans and their machines.
In "Charles Lindbergh and the Spirit of St. Louis," published this month by the Smithsonian Institution in conjunction with Harry N. Abrams Inc., Dr. van der Linden and Dr. Dominick A. Pisano, chairman of the aeronautics division at the Air and Space Museum, gave equal emphasis to the man and the plane.
"All of Lindbergh's strength and determination would have come to naught if his Spirit of St. Louis had failed, or his flight training had proven inadequate," they wrote. "Lindbergh and his aircraft were one."
The idea for the flight came to Lindbergh above the Illinois prairie, on one of his St. Louis-Chicago mail runs in 1926. Raymond Orteig, a French-born hotel owner in New York, had offered a $25,000 prize to the first aviator to cross the Atlantic in an airplane from Paris to New York or vice versa. In 1919, two British pilots had flown across from Newfoundland to Ireland, a difficult 1,900-mile trip, but not nearly as challenging as New York to Paris. The prize had yet to be won.
"Why shouldn't I fly from New York to Paris?" the young mail pilot mused. "I have more than four years of aviation behind me, and close to 2,000 hours in the air. I've barnstormed over half of the 48 states. I've flown my mail through the worst of nights."
After securing the financial backing of some businessmen in St. Louis -- hence the plane's name -- Lindbergh ordered a Ryan Airlines plane with a nine-cylinder, 223-horsepower Wright Whirlwind engine for $10,560. Beginning in February 1927, he spent two months at the Ryan factory, a converted fish cannery in San Diego, supervising every detail of the modifications and assembly of the plane. He knew exactly what he needed and wanted.
In a technical paper written two months after the Paris landing, Donald A. Hall, Ryan's chief engineer, said Lindbergh had given the following basic specifications: "That the airplane should be a monoplane type, powered with a single Wright J-5-0 engine, have a good power reserve on take-off when carrying more than 400 gallons of gasoline and must have the pilot located in rear of all tanks for safety in a forced landing."
Nothing about the components exceeded the envelope of flight experience.
The engine, built by the Wright Aeronautical Corporation in Paterson, N.J., was the best of its day in terms of power-to-weight ratio. It was air-cooled, eliminating the weight of radiators, plumbing and pumps and also the worry of more parts that might malfunction.
A lightweight, air-cooled engine, Dr. Pisano and Dr. van der Linden said, "was the most significant technological breakthrough that would ensure the eventual conquest of the Atlantic Ocean by air."
Having only a single engine was part of Lindbergh's minimalist approach. In 1926, a French pilot took off with a crew of three in a plane powered by three Wright engines. Overloaded, it crashed on the way up. Several other attempts in trimotor planes had failed.
Why carry four people, Lindbergh thought, when at most two would do? Better yet, fly alone, with as little gear as possible. Why have three engines? This only tripled the chances of an engine failure that would end the flight. Lindbergh decided to take his chances with one.
Five fuel tanks of soft steel were fitted into the plane: a small tank in the nose, the largest tank just behind it, and three others in the wing. Altogether, they held 450 gallons of gasoline, weighing 2,750 pounds, enough to travel some 4,200 miles at a cruising speed of around 100 miles per hour.
The added weight required major modifications to Ryan's standard M-2 airplane. It had to be "laid out anew," Mr. Hall said.
The airplane had to have a greater wingspan, longer fuselage and a wider landing gear than the M-2. The fabric-covered wing was lengthened 10 feet, to 46, and bolted to the fuselage by two steel struts. To maintain the shape of the longer wing, the spruce wing ribs were placed closer together, 11 inches apart instead of 14. They were trussed with piano wire. The wing's leading edge was trimmed in plywood.
The fuselage design followed standard lines with a sturdy framework of steel tubing enclosed by hand-hammered aluminum for the cowling and cotton fabric the rest of the way back. But owing to the greater wingspan and fuel-tank placement, the fuselage was lengthened by more than 2 feet, to 27 feet 8 inches.
By fitting the main tank at the plane's center of gravity, Mr. Hall had to move the cockpit farther back, where the pilot could not see directly ahead. He could only look out the celluloid windows on each side or through a small periscope, added as an afterthought. The instrument panel had fewer dials and knobs than today's economy cars. An altimeter, an airspeed indicator, a tachometer, pressure gauges and a clock and two compasses, that was about all.
Lindbergh decided against a radio, which meant he would be out of touch with the world for most of the flight, something unthinkable today. But he reasoned that radio would be useless over much of the route and its elimination translated into 90 extra gallons of gas.
In testing the plane, Lindbergh and the engineers realized that it would be slightly unstable in flight. The pilot would never be able to relax his grip on the control stick for more than a moment, or the plane would drift off course and descend.
When the engineers said they could fix it, Lindbergh told them to leave it alone -- the extra attention required to fly a slightly unstable plane should keep him awake and alert. He was right. Several times over the Atlantic, the plane's sudden lurch brought the dozing pilot's hand back to the stick.
Barry Schiff, an aviation writer who recently flew a Spirit replica, found it just as unstable as the original. It "required constant attention to keep the aircraft on an even keel," he wrote in the current issue of AOPA Pilot, a trade magazine.
"The nose hunted left and right, and porpoised like a whale," Mr. Schiff continued. "The Spirit is a high-workload airplane that never allows you to relax."
Actually, the moment of greatest risk on the flight came at takeoff on Long Island. The Spirit, fully tanked to the very margin of flyability, barely cleared telephone lines and trees at the end of the runway.
In daylight, Lindbergh flew low, often less than 100 feet above land or water, where pilots at the time supposed, incorrectly, there was a cushion of air making flight easier and smoother. At night, he steered the plane up to 5,000, sometimes 10,000 feet, high enough to pull out of a plunge if he should doze off.
Only once did the engine stop, and that was the pilot's fault. Lindbergh had neglected his hourly routine of replenishing the nose tank with gas from the larger tanks in carefully distributed amounts so as not to upset the plane's weight balance. As soon as the tank was refilled, the engine kicked back to life, and forward to Paris.
After they made history, Lindbergh and the Spirit, dismantled and crated, returned to the United States on a cruiser sent to Europe by President Calvin Coolidge. There were parades and a tour of the country in the Spirit, which touched down at least once in each of the 48 states. Then came a tour of several Latin American countries.
A year later, Lindbergh flew the Spirit one last time, from St. Louis to Washington, where the plane was retired to display at the Smithsonian Institution.
It was later moved to the Smithsonian's new Air and Space Museum, where it hangs in a spacious gallery of aerospace celebrities, including the Wright Flyer, the Bell X-1 in which Chuck Yeager broke the sound barrier, John Glenn's Friendship 7 capsule and the Apollo 11 spacecraft that took the first men to the moon.
People are always asking, Dr. van der Linden said, if this is the real Lindbergh plane. It is. The only visible difference is that the plane's shiny aluminum cowling has yellowed with age. In order to preserve the original markings, including the painted flags of nations visited on the tours, the museum's staff applied a coat of clear varnish, which has now developed a golden hue.
In 1976, the Spirit was thoroughly examined, the propeller and engine were cleaned and treated to prevent corrosion. The engine was found to be still well oiled. Some rust was removed and a few tears in the fabric were mended, that was all.
"It's a terrific airplane," Dr. van der Linden said, turning away from the Spirit of St. Louis. "Not that we would ever fly it, but I think we could."

CORRECTION-DATE: May 25, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article in Science Times on Tuesday about Charles Lindbergh's first trans-Atlantic flight referred incorrectly to the first flight of the Wright brothers' plane at Kitty Hawk. Their plane flew over 120 feet of ground, not at a height of 120 feet.
The article also referred incorrectly to the advantages of flying at a very low altitude, as Lindbergh did in daytime. Experts indeed acknowledge a "ground effect," which increases the wings' lift and thus makes flight somewhat more efficient near the surface; that was not an incorrect premise of Lindbergh's era.

GRAPHIC: Photos: Lindbergh noted incidents en route along with his first-person account printed two days after the flight. He often flew less than 100 feet above the surface, thinking there was a "ground effect," with a thick air cushion. Below, he showed the technique at Yellowstone Lake, Wyo., on his U.S. tour. (Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum)(pg. F8); (Mika Grondahl/The New York Times)(pg. F1) Chart: "Leaving Little to Chance"The design of the Spirit of St. Louis was based largely on a reliable mail plane, the Ryan M-2. Well-tested technology, with just a few adaptations for the journey, got Lindbergh over the Atlantic. WINGS -- Lightweight and almost entirely made of wood, they were designed with sturdy Warren trusses and covered in cotton fabric. FUEL LINES -- Rubber joints every 18 inches or so kept lines flexible and reduced the risk of breaks. COOLING -- Hollow valves filled with sodium drew out heat from the engine, which was cooled by air. INSIDE THE COCKPIT -- It was a claustrophobic space with no direct view forward. Lindbergh, seated in a wicker chair, used a periscope (No. 1 in the photo) which extended to his left outside the plane. STREAMLINED DESIGN -- Except for a periscope that could retract when not in use, the plane was sleek, minimizing drag. Where supporting struts met the wings, balsa wood was used for streamlining. PILOT BEHIND FUEL TANK -- Recalling earlier plane fatalities, Lindbergh insisted that he sit behind the main tank. In an accident or forced landing, he would not be crushed by the tank from behind. ENLARGEMENTS -- The wings and fuselage of the M-2 were lengthened: an extra 2 feet in the tail and 18 inches in the nose added stability; the wingspan was increased 10 feet.

HEADLINE: Enemies Of Reform 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
"I would suggest to you that the single most important innovation shaping America's capital market was the idea of generally accepted accounting principles." So declared Lawrence Summers, then deputy secretary of the Treasury, in a 1998 speech. Mr. Summers urged troubled Asian economies, then in the middle of a disastrous financial crisis, to emulate American-style "transparency and disclosure." 
 Now America has its own problems with corporate accounting, exemplified by Enron. So will we follow our own advice? Will we provide investors with the facts they need to make informed decisions? Probably not. And that's bad news, because Enron's case, though extreme, was by no means unique. 
 For corporate America as a whole, 1997 was a watershed year. According to government statistics, overall corporate profits grew rapidly between 1992 and 1997, but then stalled; after-tax profits in the third quarter of 2000 were barely higher than they were three years earlier. But the operating earnings of the S.&P. 500 -- that is, the profits companies reported to investors -- grew 46 percent over those three years.
There are technical reasons that these measures of profits need not grow at exactly the same rate, but they have historically tracked each other fairly well. So why did they suddenly diverge? Surely the main reason was that after 1997 companies made increasingly aggressive use of accounting gimmicks to create the illusion of profit growth. 
You see, corporate leaders were desperate to keep their stock prices rising, in an environment where anything short of 20 percent profit growth was considered failure. And why were they desperate? In a word: options. The bull market, combined with ever-more-generous options packages, led to an explosion of executive compensation. In 1980 chief executives at large companies, according to Business Week's estimates, earned 45 times as much as non-supervisory workers. By 1995, however, the ratio had risen to 160; by 1997, it had reached 305. C.E.O.'s wanted to keep the good times rolling, and they did: by 2000, though profits hadn't really increased, they were paid 458 times as much as ordinary workers.
The point here isn't that top executives are overpaid, though they surely are; it's that the way they are paid rewards them for creating the illusion of success, never mind the reality.
Still, that's exactly the kind of thing that accounting standards are supposed to prevent. What allowed our corporate emperors to hide their nakedness was a combination of poorly crafted standards, which I wrote about last week, and compliant auditors. Major accounting firms were all too happy to be deceived by corporate smoke and mirrors, as long as they got lucrative consulting contracts.
Time for reform? Not according to some people. Today the Senate Banking Committee is scheduled to take up a bill drafted by Paul Sarbanes, the committee's chairman, that would take some modest steps toward accounting and auditing reform. The bill has been endorsed by some of the most respected names in finance -- people like Paul Volcker, the great former Fed chairman, and John Bogle, the famed investor. But Senator Phil Gramm, throwing his weight behind an all-out lobbying effort by the accounting industry, has made it clear that he will try to kill the bill. 
I'd like to be nonpartisan here -- really I would. And there are indeed Democrats who have gotten large contributions from accounting firms. But the current effort to prevent any meaningful accounting reform is explicitly a Republican initiative, one directed from the very top: The New York Times reports that Mr. Gramm is "working closely with the Bush administration" in his efforts to block the Sarbanes bill. 
Let me repeat what I said last time: Honesty in corporate accounting isn't a left-right issue; it's about protecting all investors from exploitation by insiders. By blocking reform of a broken system, the Bush administration is favoring the interests of a tiny corporate oligarchy over those of everyone else.
One final thought: This isn't just a question of treating American investors fairly. Like the Asian nations before their crisis, the United States relies heavily on inflows of foreign capital, inflows that depend on international faith in the integrity of U.S. markets. The Bush administration may believe that investors have nowhere else to go, that the money will keep coming even if we don't reform. That's what Suharto thought, too.

HEADLINE: Federal Welfare Rolls Shrink, But Drop Is Smallest Since '94 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 20 

 BODY:
The number of people on welfare declined slightly in the final months of 2001 despite the sluggish economy and job losses caused by the Sept. 11 attacks, the Bush administration said today.
 But the decline was much more modest than in prior years, suggesting that the number of recipients may have leveled off after declining precipitously since 1994, two years before approval of the landmark 1996 welfare law. 
 From September to December of last year, the number of welfare recipients declined by 52,006, or 1 percent, to 5,284,711, the Department of Health and Human Services said. 
About 12.2 million people were on welfare in August 1996, when President Bill Clinton signed the welfare bill championed by Republicans in Congress. Since then, the number of welfare recipients has dropped by nearly 7 million, or 57 percent -- much more than many experts had expected.
Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary of health and human services, said: "Despite the soft economy and the tragic events of Sept. 11, the national welfare caseload did not increase. Our reformed welfare system rose to the challenge. It continued to help recipients move toward work, and it continued to provide aid when needed."
Thirty-four states reported increases in welfare recipients from September to December, but these were more than offset by declines in 15 other states, federal officials said. (Delaware showed no change.)
The House passed legislation last week to increase work requirements for welfare recipients, thus keeping up the pressure on states to move people from welfare to jobs.
Federal officials said preliminary data indicated that New York had the largest decline, as the number of welfare recipients fell 20 percent in the final three months of last year, to 443,340 in December, from 554,700 in September. Many New York residents apparently reached the five-year limit on cash assistance, federal officials said.
In the last quarter of the year, federal officials said, the number of people on welfare declined by 5.4 percent in Connecticut, to 56,390, and by 2.1 percent in New Jersey, to 105,690.
The other states where the number of welfare recipients declined were Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Minnesota, New Mexico, North Dakota, Rhode Island, Texas, Utah, Vermont and Wyoming.
The decline in Minnesota was particularly large, as the number of welfare recipients fell 19.8 percent, to 93,300 in December, from 116,290 in September.
States with significant increases included Arizona, up 16.8 percent, to 106,590; South Carolina, up 11.3 percent, to 49,225; and Nevada, up 10.3 percent, to 25,590.
The number of recipients increased 1.3 percent in California, to 1.2 million; 3.1 percent in Florida, to 129,450; and 6.5 percent in Georgia, to 129,935.
Federal and state officials say that many people remaining on welfare have difficulty finding jobs because they have physical or mental disabilities or lack work experience. Some cannot read or understand English. Some need drug abuse treatment.
The national unemployment rate rose significantly in the final months of 2001, to 5.8 percent in December, from 5 percent in September. The fact that the federal welfare rolls did not increase suggests that a slowdown in the economy may have less effect on the welfare rolls than many people believed, officials said.
The time limits in federal law do not apply to welfare programs financed entirely with state money, and some states have established such programs, which provide aid to some people who have left the federal rolls.

HEADLINE: Shares Surge 22% After Dynegy Tells of Proposals to Raise Cash 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, May 20 

 BODY:
Shares of Dynegy Inc. rose 22 percent today after the company, an energy trader, said it might sell assets and tap loans to raise $1 billion and ensure that the company had enough cash. 
 Shares of Dynegy increased $1.58, to $8.60, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Almost 12.2 million shares were traded. 
 The chief executive, Charles L. Watson, said on Friday that Dynegy would sell assets and take other measures to increase cash reserves in the next year. 
The company may face credit downgrades as regulators investigate its accounting practices and power trading in California. 
Mr. Watson said the company had enough cash to run the business even if its credit rating was cut, which would increase the cost of borrowing. 
Standard & Poor's said last week that Dynegy had triggers in securities and trading contracts that could produce liabilities exceeding $300 million. 
Dynegy Holdings, the unit that has most of the company's debt, is rated by Moody's Investors Service at Baa3, the lowest investment grade. The parent company, Dynegy Inc., is rated Ba1, the highest Moody's junk rating. Standard & Poor's rates Dynegy debt BBB, two notches above junk. Both credit-rating agencies say the ratings may be cut. 
Earlier this month the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission asked 150 California power sellers to admit or deny using various trading techniques, including round-trip trades, to manipulate the market. The techniques were described in documents from Enron.
Enron admitted executing round-trip trades with the CMS Energy Corporation. Those trades are being investigated. Regulators have said round-trip trades allow energy producers to inflate their volumes and revenue.
Three other energy companies have joined the list of those admitting to round-trip trades. Two traders, Aquila Inc. and the Williams Companies, announced today that they had participated in round-trip trading. Aquila said its transactions accounted for less than one-half of 1 percent of its trading and marketing revenue between 1999 and 2001.
Last week, the Duke Energy Corporation of Charlotte, N.C., reported that it had included about $1.1 billion of energy trades in financial statements over three years that had no economic benefit and were similar to those made by rivals. 
Duke said the round-trip trades constituted less than 1 percent of the $107.4 billion in trading and marketing revenue from 1999 to 2001.

HEADLINE: New Leader Faces Entrenched Problems in Paterson 

BYLINE:  By MARIA NEWMAN 

DATELINE: PATERSON, N.J., May 20 

 BODY:
Almost a week after his election as mayor of New Jersey's third-largest city, Jose Torres cannot walk downtown without everyone stopping to congratulate him. Some greet him in Spanish, others in English. Some shake his hand, others grab him in an enthusiastic bear hug.
 "Es una gran cosa" -- It is a grand thing -- said a man named Hugo who told Mr. Torres he was a chef at a restaurant here. 
 Mr. Torres, or Joey, as he is widely known, is the first Latino to be elected mayor of Paterson, and he says it is a sign of the times.
After all, Paterson is now 52 percent Hispanic, making the city one of only a few in the state -- the others are in nearby Hudson County -- where the majority of the population is Hispanic. His city's experience will be mirrored in an increasing number of cities, he said, with Latino voters becoming more important not only in local elections, but in state and national contests.
"For many years we were seen as the swing vote," he said in an interview here. "Now we are the vote."
But Mr. Torres, the son of a bodega owner and a councilman for 12 years, will need more than historical precedent to rescue a depressed city that never benefited from the economic boom of recent years. Moreover, he will have to work hard to restore confidence in City Hall after the conviction of Mayor Martin G. Barnes, who sought re-election while awaiting trial on corruption charges.
Mr. Torres, who was one of five candidates for the mayor's job, never made an issue of Mr. Barnes's pending trial on federal charges of accepting cash, vacations, designer suits and female companionship from businessmen to whom he had steered city contracts. Instead, he hammered away at Mr. Barnes's leadership.
"In the last five years, while Marty was the mayor, Paterson was one of the few cities in the nation that had a double-digit increase in crime, saw very little economic development and experienced a deterioration of our neighborhoods," Mr. Torres said. "So I think he lost on his performance."
Mr. Torres, who took over one of his father's bodegas at age 19 and has run several other businesses, is now the purchasing agent for the city's housing authority. He has served on the City Council for five terms, and said he wanted "outside the box" thinking to improve the city's finances and social problems. He wants to attract more businesses and tourists, but said his top priority would be making the city safer.
"We're going to be very aggressive about doing all these things, but it cannot happen without getting a hold of crime," he said.
Mr. Torres's parents came to Paterson 60 years ago, when few other Hispanics lived here, he said. They lived in the Christopher Columbus housing project, opened up one bodega, then opened a second. Their eight children spent much of their childhood working alongside them, and it is there, Mr. Torres said, that he learned the value of community and leadership and the role of small businesses.
"I gained a great respect for all small mom-and-pop businesses," said Mr. Torres, who was the youngest of eight siblings. "Many times they are even more powerful than your elected officials because they are the little mayors of their neighborhoods. Folks would come into our bodega and ask my daddy, 'How do you get Social Security, how do you get P.S.E.&G.?' "
When Mr. Torres was in college, his mother became ill and his father asked him to run one of the bodegas; he dropped out. 
That same year, Mr. Torres's older brother, who was a political science student working in a local campaign, talked his younger brother into running for office, to fill a Council seat that had become vacant after a member died. 
Mr. Torres lost that race by 17 votes, but was not deterred. He ran and lost five times before he was finally elected in 1990. "There was a fire in my belly to make a difference," he said.
Thomas Rooney, a former mayor and a councilman for 22 years, said Mr. Torres faced enormous challenges governing Paterson. But he added that Mr. Torres was a coalition builder, which Mr. Barnes proved not to be.
"Joey can't do it all by himself," Mr. Rooney said. "A lot of it will depend on the people he picks to help him, to lead different departments."
In the area of crime, for example, Mr. Rooney said: "There are shootings, killings. You name it, we've got it. The mayor cannot fix all of those things. But the people do want to pick a leader who they believe will make the right moves to reduce these problems." As mayor, Mr. Torres, 43, said he would try to decrease crime by decentralizing the police force, creating individual precincts at firehouses and assigning only one police officer to a squad car.
He also has plans to attract more industry, and to build an arena downtown.
To improve neighborhoods, Mr. Torres said, he has identified 3,000 lots that are either vacant or have substandard structures that can be razed. He has promised to build 500 affordable-housing units in the next five years.
Mr. Torres said the high crime rate was tied to a lack of jobs and a high dropout rate. He said that any solution had to involve the school system, which has been under state control for years for poor performance. He wants to create a technical academy within the school system to give young people trade skills.
But he knows his biggest challenge will be to convince a cynical electorate that government can be part of the city's solutions, and not the root of its negative image.
"I've been in this political arena half of my lifetime," he said. "I know that I have my work cut out for me. I'm not going to propose a five-year plan, but instead a three-year plan. And so when it comes to Year Four, and I'm running again, you can judge me on my record."

CORRECTION-DATE: May 22, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about Jose Torres, the mayor-elect of Paterson, N.J., referred incorrectly to the status of a federal corruption case against his defeated opponent, Mayor Martin G. Barnes. Mr. Barnes has been indicted, has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting trial; he has not been convicted.

HEADLINE: New Effort To Develop Seaport Site At South Street 

BYLINE:  By TERRY PRISTIN 

 BODY:
For the third time, officials have chosen a developer to rehabilitate more than a dozen dilapidated buildings within the South Street Seaport Historic District that have long been viewed as an eyesore and have confounded attempts to develop them, the city's Economic Development Corporation said yesterday.
 The newly chosen development team, which includes an affiliate of F. J. Sciame Construction, the company that built the Jewish Heritage Museum, plans to rehabilitate the city-owned loft buildings and turn them into 100 apartments, retail space and a maritime center, development corporation officials said. 
 The site, along both sides of Front Street between Beekman Street and Peck Slip, includes three vacant lots and 13 dilapidated loft buildings built between 1800 and 1838. Most of the buildings originally housed dry goods and grocery stores that served the ships docked nearby, said John Evans, an executive vice president of Sciame. 
The site has bedeviled other developers who did not realize how much work was entailed in rehabilitating the crumbling old structures, said Madelyn Wils, the chairwoman of Community Board 1, which includes the seaport. "It's an engineering nightmare," she said.
In 1985, a group of developers won the right to develop the site as a 242-room hotel, but that plan was derailed by the recession and became tied up in litigation. In 1993, some of the buildings had to be stabilized.
In 1998, another development team was designated for the site, but the deal was never closed.
In addition to Sciame, the new development team consists of Zuberry Associates, an investment company with experience in upgrading historic properties, and the Seamen's Church Institute of New York and New Jersey, a nonprofit charitable organization for mariners whose headquarters at 241 Water Street were built by Sciame. The new plan calls for a maritime center that will display the institute's collections.
Andrew M. Alper, the president of the development corporation, said that Sciame, which is based at the seaport, had the kind of experience needed for the project. "They know what they're getting themselves into," he said. "The plan they laid out was sensitive to the development needs of the community."
Mr. Evans of Sciame said the retail tenants would consist of small boutiques rather than national retailers, which are found at the seaport. "We're trying to have more of a neighborhood focus," he said. "We're trying to be interesting, funky and gritty. We're not trying to make a tourist destination out of this."
Community leaders have long complained that the shopping center at the seaport, which has struggled for years, falls short of what the neighborhood needs. "The community would like to see the seaport more community-oriented," Ms. Wils said, "and less like a general mall."
Paul Harnett, a vice president and general manager of the shopping center, said that sales at the mall had increased since Sept. 11 because the only other shopping center in the neighborhood -- the Mall at the World Trade Center -- was destroyed in the terrorist attack.

HEADLINE: Crucial Gauge of Activity Dipped in April 

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
A crucial gauge of economic activity fell in April for the first time since September, raising some doubts among analysts about whether the recovery can maintain the pace it showed in the first quarter.
 The gauge, the index of leading economic indicators by the Conference Board, a private research group based in New York, fell 0.4 percent in April. The drop brought the index to 111.7, after a rise of 0.1 percent in March. Analysts had forecast a drop of 0.1 percent for April. 
 Economists said the decline did not signal a reversal of the recovery, and played down the danger of that happening. But the report does hint at continued underlying weaknesses that could temper the pace of growth, they said.
"I don't think there's much danger of the economy sliding back into recession, but I do think we're going to pull back from the stronger pace we saw in the earlier part of the year," said Mark Vitner, an economist with Wachovia Securities in Charlotte, N.C.
Sung Won Sohn, chief economist with Wells Fargo in Minneapolis, said, "While the leading indicators is down, the coincident indicator says the economy is still rebounding." The coincident index, a gauge of the current state of the economy, rose 0.2 percent in April, to 116.0, for its fifth consecutive increase.
The index of lagging indicators, which reflects changes that have already occurred, fell 0.4 percent last month, to 100.6.
Of the 10 indicators that make up the leading index, 5 decreased in April -- real money supply, stock prices, consumer expectations, initial unemployment claims and the interest rate spread.
Looking ahead, analysts said that continued weakness in the job market was a concern because of its impact on consumers, whose spending has been the engine for the recovery. 
There is a threat that layoffs and slower growth in wages has cut into consumer incomes, an economist at the Conference Board, Ken Goldstein, said. Rising energy costs and the completion of most mortgage refinancing could slow household purchases. 
"The signal from the indicators is that the recovery is developing quite slowly," Mr. Goldstein said. "Despite the strong growth in gross domestic product in the first quarter, the recovery in the industrial core remains weak."

HEADLINE: City Board Recommends Rent Increases Of 2% and 4% 

BYLINE:  By THOMAS J. LUECK 

 BODY:
The New York City Rent Guidelines Board, rejecting calls for the first rent rollback on rent-stabilized apartments, last night recommended increases of 2 percent on one-year leases and 4 percent on two-year leases.
 The increases, which would apply to leases that are renewed between Oct. 1, 2002, and Sept. 30, 2003, would be equal to the lowest allowed in the last three decades for the city's 2.3 million tenants in rent-stabilized apartments. Such increases were approved five times in the 1990's. 
 But some on the nine-member board -- all mayoral appointees chosen to represent tenants, property owners or the public at large -- cited disparate economic factors, ranging from global warming to job losses since Sept. 11, that they said were easing the burden of landlords while placing tenants in a financial bind. 
They also pointed to a study by the board's own analysts, released in April, that found a slight decline in landlords' operating costs for the first time since an index of such costs was created in 1969. The study attributed the 1.6 percent decline largely to reduced utility and fuel costs.
"This is a historic opportunity for New York City," said Adriene L. Holder, a lawyer and board member representing tenants who voted in favor of a failed proposal to decrease rent by 1.75 percent on one-year leases and 3.5 percent on two-year leases.
"If not now, when?" she asked. Ms. Holder, a Legal Aid Society lawyer, said the city's weak economy had put even small rent increases out of reach for a growing number of middle-income people.
The board's recommended rent increases will be the subject of a public hearing scheduled for June 26. A final vote is to be held on June 27. The recommendations have almost always been adopted by the board, despite a boisterous annual rite of protest by tenants' rights advocates and landlords.
The board's meeting last night, attended by about 100 people and interrupted by occasional boos and verbal sniping from tenants' advocates, was nonetheless more subdued than in other years.
Board members representing landlords have always maintained that some rent-stabilized tenants pay less in rent than is needed to maintain their apartments, and said last night that the equation had not changed.
"We should be concerned about the health of the housing industry," said Harold K. Lubell, a board member, who argued that increased costs for insurance and labor had offset landlords' savings for fuel and utility bills. His proposal was a 5 percent increase on one-year leases, and an 8 percent increase on two-year leases.
The meeting last night, held in an auditorium of the United States Custom House at Bowling Green, came after Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, in a marked departure from the heavy hand that had been placed on rent guidelines by the Giuliani administration, said in April that he had no intention of asserting control over decisions of the Rent Guidelines Board.
"I'll wait and see what they say," Mr. Bloomberg said, when he was asked if there should be any increase in rents for stabilized tenants this year.
"The whole process of the Rent Guidelines Board was to take it out of politics," the mayor said. "And I think that is probably a good thing."
"You will never please the tenants and the landlords at the same time. You probably won't please either at the same time, but there's a reason why this was set and I think we should let it play out."
Mayor Giuliani had angered tenants and landlords almost every year when rent increases were being deliberated by the board. The former mayor frequently railed against the board for raising rents more than he wanted.
Tensions reached a peak last year, when Mr. Giuliani forced out his appointee as board chairman, Edward S. Hochman.
Mr. Hochman responded by accusing Mr. Giuliani of being a "control freak" who treated the board's members as "messenger boys."

HEADLINE: Despite a Year of Upheavals, Economic Optimism Is High 

BYLINE:  By DAVID LEONHARDT 

 BODY:
With a stock market bust, a recession that wiped out almost two million jobs and the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, Americans would seem to have plenty of reasons to worry about a diminished future. Instead, they have emerged from the nation's recent turmoil far more optimistic than after any other economic downturn in a generation.
 In place of the economic malaise that generally plagued the public in the 1970's and from the late 1980's through the early 1990's, polls show that by wide margins Americans now say that the coming years will be prosperous and that today's children will live better than their parents. 
 In a survey by the University of Michigan, for example, half of those polled said that they believe that the next five years will bring continuous good times, more than did at any point from 1970 to 1996 and up from a low of 8 percent in 1975.
Monthly measures of consumer confidence, much higher than they were at the end of other downturns in recent decades, suggest that people now see a recession as merely a hiccup. On Friday, Michigan's widely followed index of consumer sentiment moved up in a sign that many people believe that the country's recent economic troubles are fading. 
"I think back to how it felt in the early 90's, and it was much different," said Arla Lerman, 43, a real estate broker who lives in Evanston, Ill. "We were really worried about what was going to happen and how we were going to come out of it."
Today's underlying optimism helps explain a central economic mystery of the last year: the continued willingness of consumers, despite uncertain times, the fall in the stock market and a sharp contraction in business investment, to take on more debt and buy new houses and other costly items. Their spending allowed last year's economic downturn to be among the shortest and perhaps the mildest on record, defying many post-Sept. 11 predictions that it would turn into the worst in decades.
Indeed, the recent recession is now almost certain to be the only one since 1949 in which consumer spending did not decline in any quarter. Last week, the government said that retail sales rose a solid 1.2 percent from March to April. But the recovery could be shaping up to be a meager one, according to leading economic indicators released yesterday by the Conference Board, a research firm in New York.
The confidence in America's economic future rests on two decades in which inflation and interest rates generally fell, one foreign economic rival after another faltered and long-term investments in stocks and homes were usually rewarded.
Even though the Dow Jones industrial average has dropped nearly 10 percent in the last year, it is twice as high as it was in late 1995. House prices are still rising in most cities. Unemployment has spiked since late 2000 but is significantly lower than it was at the end of past recessions.
"The image of America has been of a powerful, booming country without peer, an image that we haven't seen since the 1950's," said Alan Brinkley, a professor of American history at Columbia University. "We're seeing the cumulative impact of a social experience that extends back over a generation."
This rosy spirit may not necessarily last. The national mood tends to shift slowly, as it did when the problems of the 1970's chipped away relentlessly at the confidence of previous years. Many people are holding onto memories of the booming 90's, public opinion experts said; a stagnating stock market, a slump in earnings, or another terrorist attack could bring a new wave of doubt.
Already, people give a rosier appraisal of the country's condition than they do of their own, said Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Research Center.
Much of the new optimism probably stems from the higher pay that people in all income groups have been getting since 1996.
When joblessness fell in the late 1990's to the lowest level since the early 1970's, even the poorest fifth of American families received, on average, a 14 percent raise over the rate of inflation from 1996 to 2000, according to the Economic Policy Institute in Washington. From 1973 to 1996, real incomes for those in the same group fell 2 percent.
Middle-class families, who made only meager gains in the 1970's and 80's, also achieved solid progress in the late 90's. Affluent families continued to make the biggest strides.
The nation's families do not consider their own financial situation to be better than they did 20 years, according to polls, perhaps because many now work longer hours. But the recent income gains seem to have made them more sanguine about the years ahead.
"Maybe I'm overly optimistic," said Shirley Kagiwama-Manley, a 42-year-old computer programmer who lives in Littleton, Colo., with her husband and two children. "I just think everything is cyclical."
Over all, she was still confident enough to spend a recent afternoon on what she called a "girls' splurge," getting pedicures with friends at a Denver spa and then going to dinner. 
"This isn't something I do all the time," she said, while waiting for her red toenail polish to dry.
The political implications of the new optimism are less clear than the economic effects, public opinion experts said. Incumbents have won a large share of their races over the last eight years, but many analysts think that reflects other factors as much as it does the improved sense of national well-being.
It is clear, however, that Americans have recently become more satisfied with and more optimistic about the economy.
In a monthly survey, the Conference Board asks people to evaluate the economy as positive, negative or neutral and to predict its condition in six months. In April, the index that the company calculates from the responses was at 109, up from a recent low of 85. In the 1990-91 recession, by contrast, it hit a low of 55, fell back to 47 in 1992, and did not recover to last month's level of 109 until 1996. The index fell to similar lows in the early 80's and mid-70's.
In the 60's, a decade of mostly good times, confidence measures behaved much as they have the last decade.
Similarly, in early September -- even before the terror attacks caused a surge of a patriotism and the answers to become more positive -- 43 percent of people told the Gallup Poll that they were satisfied "with the way things were going in the United States."
In 1990, the number fell as low as 29 percent and then dipped further, in 1992, to 14 percent. In the late 70's and early 80's, it fluctuated from 12 percent to 35 percent.
To most Americans, the future seems brighter, too. In a New York Times/CBS News Poll late last year, more than 70 percent said that today's youth were likely to have a better life than their parents. In 1983, only 54 percent of respondents gave that answer, according to the Roper Organization, and the number remained near that in the mid-90's.
By now, however, almost everybody younger than 40 has experienced only one or two recessions as adults, and both were mild. During that span, layoffs have become common even in good times, but the economy has created enough new jobs to keep unemployment low.
"It feels like people I know who have been laid off have been able to find other jobs," said Ann Perry, a 38-year-old agent for artists and photographers in Pleasant Ridge, Mich., a suburb of Detroit. Ms. Perry said her business was "painfully slow" the last year but that the economy still seemed much healthier than it did a decade ago.
"I see people are still buying cars, still making home improvements," Ms. Perry said. "Things can't be that bad if so many people are driving these big, fancy S.U.V.'s."
Indeed, some of the best evidence of the confidence has been the powerful response to zero-interest financing offers major automakers began late last year. Almost six million people bought vehicles in the last four months of 2001, and most of them added thousands of dollars to their debt loads to do so.
"In a prior era, that promotion would have fallen flat," said Richard T. Curtin, director of the University of Michigan's monthly consumer surveys. "But if you view your long-term prospects as good, you say, 'zero-interest loans? That's an opportunity I can't miss.' "
Many forecasters expected consumer spending to falter early this year, saying people would retrench after the buying binge. But spending grew, rising at a relatively fast annual rate of 3.5 percent in the first three months of the year, according to the Commerce Department.
The buying of homes, which is not included in the spending numbers, has remained strong, too. Ever-increasing home values -- the most significant source of wealth for most families -- have helped many people feel more secure.
"When we bought our house, it felt like a big risk," said Kathryn L. Evans, a map dealer in New Orleans. 
In 1991, Ms. Evans and her husband, a firefighter, bought their century-old home in the city's Uptown section, when crime there was common and the economy was weak. The house is now worth three times what they have spent on it, she said.
Such increases in value have seared into people's minds the idea that investments will almost always pay off, as long as they wait a few years. Perhaps perversely, expectations for future returns have even increased.
About 90 percent of investors say the stock market will increase over the next 12 months, up from 64 percent in 1989, according to a survey by the Yale Schol of Management. The level has remained almost unchanged since early 2001 even as the market has dropped.
"People still remember the 90's," said Robert Shiller, an economist who oversees the survey.
James Wright is one of the optimists, despite having lost about 30 percent of the value of his 401(k) in recent years. "I'm still secure in investing in the stock market for the long run," said Mr. Wright, 57, of Deerfield, Ill. "For me, it's investing in the U.S., and so it's a good investment."
The dark lining to today's optimism may be the high expectations that many Americans now have for the future. If unemployment does not fall soon or the stock or housing market stagnates for years, the prosperity of the 90's will eventually start to feel far away.
"This has been a remarkable achievement," Mr. Curtin, the survey researcher, said about the shift from pessimism to optimism. "But let me caution you that it ain't over."

HEADLINE: Loans to Poor At Tax Time Are Criticized 

BYLINE:  By DAVID CAY JOHNSTON 

 BODY:
A federal tax credit intedned to lift millions of low-income families out of poverty has become a financial bonanza for the two leading tax preparation companies and the companies they work with to arrange high-cost loans, according to a study to be released today.
 Tax preparers and lenders take in about $1.75 billion in fees to arrange payment each year of some $30 billion in earned- income tax credits to working parents, researchers from the Brookings Institution and the Progressive Policy Institute found after analyzing detailed Internal Revenue Service data. Nearly 7 cents of every dollar of aid that goes to these poor families winds up with the lenders and preparers, the study found. 
 The biggest tax preparation firms, H & R Block and Jackson Hewitt, a unit of Cendant, and their lending partners, Household International and Pacific Capital Bancorp, profit by preparing tax returns and then lending customers the amount of their payment or refund at high interest rates until it arrives. 
Looking at the most recent tax return information available, the researchers found that the companies' "fast cash" lending services generated at least $357 million in profit in 1999, more than double the profit in 1998.
The study found great discrepancies in how these services are sold, with the highest rates charged in the neighborhoods that have the most tax preparation and loan offices. In the South, for example, two-thirds of the people who claim the credit take out a loan. In San Francisco, by contrast, one in nine families takes out a loan. 
Slightly more than a fifth take out a loan in New York, where the city has twice gone to court to fight what it viewed as deceptive advertising of the loans.
About 19 million receive the earned-income tax, with about 5 million gaining enough to rise above the poverty line, and 4.9 million taking out the loan. 
The loans typically are issued for flat fees, often $78 or $88, which usually equate to annual interest rates of more than 100 percent and sometimes as much as 1,500 percent. The loans usually speed payments by about a week to 17 days because the firms arrange for clients to file electronically, by far the fastest way to receive refunds.
Alan Berube, lead author of the study, said that the money spent on tax-and-loan fees equals several weeks of groceries for many poor families. "These fees blunt the impact of the credit in lifting the working poor out of poverty," he said.
Bob Schneider, a spokesman for H & R Block, said the fees cited in the study were accurate for his firm, but that taxpayers claiming the credit and taking out a loan typically were due a $3,000 refund. That means, he said, that the share going to fees is closer to 6 percent than to 13 percent.
Megan Hayden, a spokeswoman for Household International, said it made refund-anticipation loans because "there is still a demand for them." She said that Household expected this business to decline significantly if the I.R.S. succeeded in its plans to issue refunds within 72 hours to people who file electronically and identify a bank account to receive their refund.
The study said that demand for these costly services was "driven by government policy" and that more benefits would flow directly to the poor if the government simplified tax forms and speeded up refunds.
Even though most of the working poor have only wage income, applying for the credit is so daunting that 68 percent of those seeking it hire a tax preparer and they are audited at far higher rates than most other taxpayers, largely because of errors on tax returns claiming the credit and disputes over who is entitled to claim children as dependents.
Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill said earlier this month that he had ordered a study of how to simplify these tax returns. 
Anne Kim, a co-author of the study from the Progressive Policy Institute, a research organization for centrist Democrats, said she was most surprised at the rapid growth Jackson Hewitt had made by focusing on preparing returns for the working poor and arranging loans. The firm has 3,800 offices, up from 15 in 1986.
Michael Lister, the president of Jackson Hewitt, said we "concentrate our efforts on people who make less than $30,000, or $50,000."
He said that while $88 for a loan of up to 17 days might seem costly, it was a bargain compared with what he saw before banks began making such loans in the late 1980's.
Poor parents, , he said, would take their tax return to pawn shops and other businesses, which would give them half their refund in cash.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place; 
Guess Who Doesn't Back Fannie, Freddie And Farmer

BYLINE:  By ALISON LEIGH COWAN 

 BODY:
Perhaps the only warning label more ignored than the one on cigarette packs is the one stamped on debt offerings issued by government-sponsored enterprises like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and Farmer Mac. 
 The boldface disclaimers state that the securities are not guaranteed by and do not constitute debts or obligations of the United States government. 
 But the warnings are roundly dismissed by the analysts who follow the issuers' stocks, the agencies that rate their senior debt and the money managers who put their commercial paper in money market funds. In interview after interview, market professionals said that even if the paper did not carry an overt government guarantee, there was an implied guarantee, which was just as good, and the government would not allow weakness in the securities to wreak havoc.
That market confidence is evident in the low interest rates that the organizations have to pay investors for financing, often only half a percentage point more than what the United States Treasury pays. 
It also shows up in a financial instrument that is really an insurance policy that would pay off if one of the government enterprises defaulted. The cost of that insurance has barely budged for the biggest companies, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, whose default is so unthinkable that Wall Street charges less than half what it charges to provide similar peace of mind to an investor in J. P. Morgan Chase or American Express. But the cost has more than doubled in the last month for investors who want to protect against a default by Farmer Mac, the Federal Agricultural Mortgage Corporation, on a report that management may have engaged in risky practices. 
The best-known enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, use their low borrowing costs to buy home mortgages from banks, repackaging the loans as tradable securities and thereby supporting the secondary market for home loans. Farmer Mac, begun 14 years ago, aims to do for farm lending what Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have done for home loans.
The charters, written by Congress, in most cases allow the secretary of the Treasury to lend the government-sponsored enterprises money if the situation warrants. "You can't underestimate the strength of the G.S.E. charter," said Paul Miller, an analyst who covers government-sponsored enterprises for Friedman Billings Ramsey in Washington. 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac can each ask the Treasury to buy as much as $2.25 billion of their obligations, while Farmer Mac can request $1.5 billion in support.
Though the numbers sound big, the money would not go far, given how much these entities have grown. Fannie Mae's $2.25 billion figure was last revised in 1957, when its portfolio was $3.64 billion. Today, Fannie Mae has $769 billion in obligations on its balance sheet, and $896 billion in off-balance-sheet guarantees. 
Careful reading of the charters also suggests that the backstops are there to protect the guarantees these entities affix on loans or securities in furtherance of their mission. It is far less clear whether these entities would be able to turn to the Treasury if they overextended themselves and had difficulty, say, rolling over their commercial paper, the preferred method for short-term financing.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have a policy of keeping three months of liquid investments on hand as a contingency. Farmer Mac, in contrast, has $1.4 billion in cash and securities on its balance sheet, versus some $2.2 billion of short-term obligations that roll over every week on average.
Farmer Mac was asked by investors to describe how it might handle a hiccup in the commercial paper market, according to several people who visited the company's Washington office on April 8. Henry D. Edelman, the chief executive, said that if a sale of investments failed to raise enough cash, "well, we do have a $1.5 billion guarantee from the U.S. government," the investors said they were told. In a follow-up question, though, he allowed that the backstop could not be used to cover general obligations, the investors said.
Asked about that conversation and other issues on Friday, Jerome G. Oslick, Farmer Mac's general counsel, replied that the company would not respond. 
For all the potential risks lurking on their balance sheets, the government-sponsored enterprises argue that the government gets a lot of bang for its theoretical buck. So long as the government never has to mount a rescue, they have a point.
But the bigger they get, the greater the public's exposure. 
Certainly, Fannie and Freddie are already so large that some argue the government could no more let them fail than Chrysler, which got federal help in 1980. "The issue is what would the government do here, and I'd argue there is an implicit guarantee with Citigroup, J. P. Morgan Chase, General Electric" as well, Mr. Miller said. "The government cannot allow any of these big institutions to fail." 
Contagion would be one problem. Two-fifths of all United States financial institutions hold one to five times as much debt from these agencies as they do capital. The system encourages banks to treat the agencies' paper as a near substitute for Treasuries, so that concentration limits do not apply. Central banks are also big holders.
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have at least enough financial heft to garner an A- financial-strength rating from Moody's when assessed solely on their merits. With the government's implicit backing, their senior debt rises to Aaa.
How Farmer Mac might fare without its government-issued safety net is less clear, partly because it has never agreed to have its securities rated. This might be news to Fulcrum Trust, which held Farmer Mac medium-term notes in its strategic income portfolio as of June 30, 2000, and described them as Aaa paper in a government filing.
Michael Buckley, spokesman for Allmerica, Fulcrum's investment manager, said the ratings information came from a third-party provider that consults Bloomberg when unsure of the information. Until two months ago, Bloomberg's terminals also incorrectly characterized Farmer Mac's medium-term notes as Aaa, according to market participants.
A Bloomberg official said last night that the company believed that the initial information came from one of Farmer Mac's underwriters.
As Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has warned, a lack of due diligence is inevitable in a world where market participants assume the government will make things right. George J. Benston, a finance professor at Emory University who served on Farmer Mac's board in its early days, said the failure of a smaller enterprise would actually give the government "a wonderful chance to teach the market a lesson at a bargain price."
"Legally, the government is not obligated," he said. "But Congress tends to bail these people out."
There are rumblings that even Congress is having second thoughts. Representative Christopher Shays, Republican of Connecticut, and Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts, want Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to comply with the same disclosure rules as other public companies. And Paul A. Volcker, the former Fed chairman, has stated publicly that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac may have become larger than Congress intended.
Richard H. Baker, the head of a House subcommittee that has long sought to rein in the government-sponsored enterprises, reports feeling less lonely these days. Featured last week in a Friedman Billings Ramsey conference call with investors, he joked that he used to make his staff check his car before climbing in. Now, he says, congressmen still won't take the podium but do support him privately. "More people are willing to stand up and say at least something should be done," he added in an interview on Friday.
For now, his energies are devoted to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac "to make sure taxpayers are not called upon in difficult times," he said. Asked about Farmer Mac, he told the investors that "we have significant exposure there."
"The only solace I take," he added, "is that it is not as big as the housing G.S.E.'s, so hopefully we can get to them when we get to them." 

GRAPHIC: Chart: "Sleep Easy, for a Price"In the credit default swap market, investors can buy and sell contracts that act as insurance should a company default on its obligations in the next five years. Even though the companies may have high credit ratings, the annual premiums vary widely depending on investors' views of each company's viability. By this measure, investors consider Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to be among the safest investments on the list below and Farmer Mac among the least safe. Here are the prices as of May 20.

HEADLINE: Afghan Warlord Muddles Interim Government's Plans 

BYLINE:  By DAVID ROHDE 

DATELINE: KHOST, Afghanistan, May 20 

 BODY:
Over the last three weeks, Afghanistan's interim leader has declared him a wanted killer. A handpicked successor has been dispatched here to dethrone him, and 3,000 government troops in Kabul have been put on alert to attack him. 
 But today Padsha Khan Zadran did what he has done for the last several months: laughed at Hamid Karzai and his interim government in Kabul. "Mr. Karzai has some problem with his mind," Mr. Zadran said this afternoon, as a smug grin spread across his leathery face. "He is nothing. He is a common man." 
 Three weeks after Mr. Karzai demanded Mr. Zadran's arrest, this warlord is the most glaring example in Afghanistan of the central government's inability to control events outside of Kabul, the capital. 
Mr. Zadran still controls large swathes of Khost and Paktia province, strategic areas where American forces are hunting for Al Qaeda fighters. The threatened military attack is on hold. Further, Mr. Zadran, a fierce, illiterate man brimming with bluster, appears to have grown even bolder. 
After delivering his usual taunts aimed at Mr. Karzai this afternoon, Mr. Zadran announced that he would attend the loya jirga, a grand council of leaders and tribal elders from around the country planned for mid-June that will choose a government for the next two years.
His goal? To unseat Mr. Karzai. "I will send my representatives and I will go myself," he said as he sat in the governor's complex here that he was ordered to leave months ago. "Karzai is only a temporary chairman. Nobody supports him."
Mr. Zadran's threat is largely empty. He is unlikely to go to the loya jirga, where he could easily be arrested. But he remains a glaring failure for the Karzai government as political violence appears to be spreading gradually. A man was shot dead Sunday after winning the first of two rounds to represent the western district of Chaghcharan at the loya jirga. It was the first killing to mar the selection process.
Mr. Zadran's position here appears intact. Scores of men toting assault rifles and wearing bandoleers milled around the governor's complex here today. A dozen tribal elders lined up outside his door to pay their respects. Hakim Taniwal, the soft-spoken sociology professor sent to unseat him, remains in the governor's official guest house a mile away.
Western diplomats and some of Mr. Zadran's Afghan rivals blame the United States military for propping him up. American Special Forces have hired 600 of Mr. Zadran's soldiers and 500 of Mr. Taniwal's soldiers to help seal the nearby border with Pakistan, a move that rivals say inflates Mr. Zadran's political and economic power. 
In an interview tonight, Mr. Taniwal, an Afghan exile who left his wife and children and a comfortable teaching position in Melbourne, Australia, to take on Mr. Zadran, said he was the one who asked Mr. Karzai to hold off on a military attack. 
Wearing white trousers and tunic and a prayer cap in a room full of ferocious-looking men in black turbans, he looked and sounded like the out-of-place academic he is in Khost. A volatile provincial capital near the Pakistan border, Khost was once a Qaeda and Taliban stronghold.
"I want to remove the Kalashnikov culture," he said, using the name of a popular rifle to refer to the decade-old Afghan practice of resolving political disputes with force. "I am a teacher, not a commander."
He proceeded to lay out a strategy that was a microcosm of the gamble Mr. Karzai's government and his American backers appear to be taking across Afghanistan. Instead of confronting Mr. Zadran with force, Mr. Taniwal hopes to bury his rival with cash. 
Mr. Taniwal is mounting a two-pronged effort to show local residents and local gunmen that he has the funds from international donors to pay salaries. At the same time, he is trying to cut off Mr. Zadran's access to all local government agencies that produce revenue.
"I am cutting his sources," Mr. Taniwal proudly announced tonight. "He cannot pay his people." He went on to predict optimistically that Mr. Zadran would surrender to the authorities before the loya jirga convenes on June 10.
The same dynamic is occurring on a national scale. The United States and other countries are funneling much of their aid money through Kabul to give Mr. Karzai economic leverage over defiant warlords. 
But this morning Mr. Zadran insisted that he still controlled revenue-producing offices in the local government. There is also a panoply of practices -- like smuggling -- that Mr. Zadran and other warlords can use to raise cash. 
This afternoon, he held court in the governor's office as a dozen elders from his native Zadran tribe paid their respects. He looked on like a beaming father when one tribal leader assailed Mr. Karzai for unfairly attacking Mr. Zadran. He then stood up and excused himself. "I have many tribal leaders who have come to see me," he said. "I have to go."

HEADLINE: Hailing an Old Cry, 'Viva Cuba Libre!' 

BYLINE:  By DANA CANEDY 

DATELINE: MIAMI, May 20 

 BODY:
Many Cuban immigrants felt they had a lot to celebrate today: not only their homeland's centennial but also the growth of their political strength here in the new homeland they have adopted.
 President Bush added weight to that sense of power today by traveling to Miami to proclaim that the "Cuban people's love of liberty cannot and will not be denied." 
 Mr. Bush called for free elections in Cuba and the release of political prisoners; he also said he supported giving American scholarships to Cuban dissidents and families of political prisoners. In a city with its own Little Havana, his message played well. 
"This is why we like him," said Cirilo Cabezas, 64, a retired Las Vegas casino dealer who is Cuban-American. "We think he will keep his promise."
Another supporter, Miguel Fuentes, 80, said the president gave him hope. "I feel very positive about what he said and the initiatives he proposed. I feel he was able to relate to our sentiments, not just politically, but as a human being."
There were skeptics, too. Nolis Mesa, 64, a real estate broker, citing the slogan "Viva Cuba Libre!" -- "Long Live Free Cuba!" -- said Mr. Bush had "said the same thing that Clinton said and that Reagan said," then added, "I have been listening to the same phrase for 42 years."
Asserting that political parties came to Miami merely to fight for their own interests, and that Mr. Bush was working the Cuban community for votes, Mr. Nolis said, "I'm not going to participate in this dance." 
But political experts did not see such minority views standing in the president's way as he pursued what they called a strategic effort to begin mobilizing voter support.
"I think he is trying to kill two birds with one stone," said Jim Kane, director of the Florida Voter Poll, a political news and polling service, alluding to the Bush brothers' political future -- George's in 2004 and Jeb's in the November governor's race. 
Cuban-Americans, Mr. Kane said, represent about 8 percent of Florida voters, and as many as 90 percent are Republicans.
"Florida is a very important state politically, a state that elected him in 2000," Mr. Kane said. "Coming here allows him to solidify his position with the Republican base in Florida."
Not to mention that "following Jimmy Carter's recent trip to Cuba, it's even more important," Mr. Kane added, pointing out that Mr. Bush "needs to end that concern among Cuban-Americans about the embargo and reassure them that the embargo will continue."
As the president used the occasion to do just that, Haitian immigrants used the occasion to protest what they and a growing group of lawmakers from both parties say is a discriminatory administration policy: basing treatment of asylum seekers on whether the rickety boats they took to the seas in were from Cuba or Haiti.
In December, the Immigration and Naturalization Service began requiring officials here to detain Haitian refugees with plausible asylum claims -- instead of releasing them to relatives or sponsors while their claims are pursued. The requirement applies only in South Florida.
The agency defends the policy as a way to deter thousands of Haitians from taking to sea in unstable rafts and flooding South Florida, or dying en route. But that is not the view of Marleine Bastien, executive director of Haitian Women of Miami Inc. and one of the protest organizers.
"It is really sad that the U.S. that is supposed to be the champion of human rights keeps violating the rights of Haitian refugees who come to this country in search of freedom," she said.
In a city often accused of being overly segregated, many Cuban and Haitian immigrants agreed today that the government should treat all asylum seekers equally. So while Cuban-Americans praised the president's speech, some said they could not help wishing his outlook could apply in some measure to Haitian causes. They linked the disparity to a basic difference between Cuba and Haiti: one is Communist, the other simply impoverished. 
Antonio Ramos, 48, a Cuban-American architect, said, "I believe Haitians are like any other immigrant group and deserve the same treatment."

Bush Links Embargo's End To Major Changes in Cuba
President Bush, speaking to Cuban-Americans in Miami on the 100th anniversary of Cuban independence, said he would not lift travel restrictions and a trade embargo against Cuba unless President Fidel Castro met a broad array of democratic and economic changes. The president also threatened to veto any effort by Congress to ease trade restrictions. His audience responded approvingly. A1

Sharon Pares His Coalition
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon fired ministers from the strict Orthodox Shas party from his cabinet after they voted against an emergency economic package in Israel's parliament. The move significantly narrowed his government's political base and raised the possibility of early elections. The move also made Mr. Sharon dependent on Labor, his former rival, for survival in power. A8

The authority of the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat is being challenged by a younger generation of street leaders who grew up fighting Israeli occupation, according to Palestinian political analysts and Israeli intelligence officials. A8

A Call for Kashmir Monitors
Pakistan called for international monitors to be stationed on the border with India in the disputed Kashmir region. The Foreign Ministry announcement appeared to be an effort to diffuse the recent standoff and to disprove Indian accusations that separatist rebels were being allowed to infiltrate the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir from the Pakistani side of the border. A10

Indian-Pakistani artillery barrages persisted for the fourth day in Kashmir, while militants carried out at least three deadly attacks against the Indian military in Jammu. A10

A Warlord's Challenge
Padsha Khan Zadran vowed to attend the coming council that is to choose a permanent leader for Afghanistan. He said he would do so for the express purpose of unseating Afghanistan's interim leader, Hamid Karzai, who has declared Mr. Zadran a wanted killer, dispatched a handpicked successor to dethrone him and put 3,000 government troops in Kabul on alert to attack him.

Justice Officials Learned Of Memo Soon After 9/11
Attorney General John Ashcroft and F.B.I. Director Robert S. Mueller III were told days after the Sept. 11 attacks about warnings contained in the July 2001 F.B.I. memo that Osama bin Laden's followers could be training at American flight schools, government officials said. But senior officials said that neither Mr. Ashcroft nor Mr. Mueller briefed President Bush and his national security staff about it until recently. A1

Mr. Mueller warned yesterday that suicide bombings, like those that have left hundreds dead in Israel, were "inevitable" on American soil. A1

Emergency officials warned that complacency was creeping back into American society. A17

The I.N.S. mishandled paperwork relating to some Sept. 11 hijackers partly because of "a widespread failure by many individuals" in the agency, a Justice Department inquiry said. A16

Slight Decline in Welfare Rolls
The number of people on welfare declined slightly in the final months of 2001, though that decline was much more modest than in prior years, suggesting that the number of recipients may have leveled off after declining precipitously since 1994, two years before a welfare law overhaul. A12

Sex Offender Laws Reviewed
The Supreme Court substantially broadened its review of laws under which states keep the public informed of the whereabouts of convicted sex offenders who have been released. A14

The court ruled that a state may not impose even a suspended sentence on an indigent defendant for whom it has not appointed a lawyer. A14

'63 Bomb Case Nears End
The defense rested in the Alabama trial of Bobby Frank Cherry, the 71-year-old former Klansman accused of killing four girls in the bombing of a Birmingham church in 1963. A1

Dissent in Some Parishes
Bishops in several dioceses have been surprised by the reactions of parishioners to efforts to guard against the abuse of minors by priests; some parishioners think the new approach amounts to a witch hunt. A1

HEADLINE: Long-Shot Winner Turns Dark Horse 

BYLINE:  By JAMES STERNGOLD 

DATELINE: BURBANK, Calif., May 17 

 BODY:
Bill Simon Jr. beamed here the other day when he introduced a high-powered group of business and political leaders who had agreed to advise his campaign for governor. On the dais, standing rigid, were Rudolph W. Giuliani, former mayor of New York; George P. Shultz, former secretary of state; and several onetime state officials.
 Then Mr. Simon came out swinging, at least by his standards. The advisory group, he said, will provide "the kind of vision that has been so sadly lacking" under the Democratic incumbent, Gray Davis. Mr. Davis's budget policies have been "terribly flawed," said Mr. Simon, who promised to "put California back on the right track again." 
 He was speaking to an almost empty room. 
It has been less than three months since Mr. Simon, a wealthy businessman, son of former Treasury Secretary William E. Simon and first-time candidate for political office, won a come-from-behind victory in the Republican primary. But already his candidacy appears to have lost the momentum from that upset.
Mr. Simon has been holding campaign events that are all but ignored, and the gap between his war chest and that of Mr. Davis remains vast. The governor, a prodigious fund-raiser, has a little more than $28 million in hand; Mr. Simon, who had less than $700,000 after the March primary, has been able to amass $6 million or so with help from President Bush.
One problem, many members of his own party complain, is the soft, sunny tone that Mr. Simon adopts in his efforts to strike a Reaganesque pose, in contrast to the hard-hitting Davis campaign, which has called Mr. Simon a "rank amateur" and a "sanctimonious hypocrite."
Mr. Simon's aides argue that opponents who underestimated him in the primary paid the price, and maintain that voters will respond more to his hopeful, pro-business themes than to slashing attacks. But even some senior Republicans criticize his distaste for the harsh offensive and his insistence on describing himself as a Reagan conservative above the fray.
"There are some situations where he's just politically naive," said Dave Cox, who heads the Republican caucus in the State Assembly. "Ultimately he has to define himself better, and when you run for governor you have to be prepared to play with the big boys."
Mr. Cox did add that "he's a quick learner, and his positive image, that could be an asset."
But Dan Schnur, a Republican consultant who worked in the primary for Mr. Simon's principal opponent, former Mayor Richard J. Riordan of Los Angeles, said of the nominee's campaign team: "It's clearly taking them some time to shift out of primary mode and into general-election mode. And in a general election, you have to be prepared to go on the attack."
Mr. Simon roared through the primary, not only having closed a 30-point deficit to defeat Mr. Riordan but also, according to some polls, emerging with a small edge over Mr. Davis. He ignored both the centrist tack taken by Mr. Riordan and President Bush's "compassionate conservatism," but conservatives here liked his strong opposition to new taxes, abortion and gun control.
His campaign reeled in mid-April, however, when it appeared caught completely unprepared by demands from Democrats and news organizations that he release his tax returns. He refused, though issuing a few financial summaries and saying he had paid millions of dollars in taxes in recent years. The effect was to make him look evasive in the face of Mr. Davis's attacks.
A poll issued by the Field Institute on April 28 found that the governor had opened a 14-point lead.
It is not that Mr. Davis has been without recent problems of his own. First came disclosures that his campaign received a $25,000 contribution from the software giant Oracle Corporation shortly after the company had signed a $95 million state contract that auditors have called too expensive and potentially unneeded. Then Mr. Davis acknowledged that after several years of surpluses, the state was facing a budget shortfall this year and next that could reach nearly $24 billion.
Such unpredictable developments could turn the tide several more times before the November election. That is why it is so important, many experts say, that Mr. Simon become more combative. So far, he has not been able to exploit the governor's stumbles.
"Simon has gotten no traction from his upset in the primary," said Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a political scientist at the University of Southern California. "His people are right to try and fashion that kind of Reagan dynamic, but people knew a lot more about Reagan. Simon's really been under the radar screen since the primary, and he hasn't defined himself."
Clearly he is trying. In an interview the other day after touring a City of Commerce printing plant where he was trailed by a mere three or four reporters, he first hinted that laws might have been broken in the Oracle case. Then he turned back to the issues he is most comfortable with, like taxes.
"Absent evidence of criminal wrongdoing on his part," Mr. Simon said of the governor, "I think the campaign will revolve around schools, jobs and stimulating this economy." 
His chief strategist, Sal Russo, sounded a more aggressive note, but the tactics he outlined nonetheless painted the candidate as a man more of ideas than of political warfare.
"There is a perception that Gray Davis has fostered a culture of corruption, and we will make that point," Mr. Russo said. "We will talk about the culture of extortion that has grown up around Gray Davis. But that's not the easiest thing for Bill. Bill is more comfortable in the realm of ideas. That's what motivated him to get involved in the first place."
Despite several joint appearances with President Bush in California and Washington, Mr. Simon has not grown much closer to the White House, which openly backed Mr. Riordan in the primary.
The Bush administration has since sought to embrace Mr. Simon, and a senior White House official said in an interview that he believed the nominee was an excellent candidate with a great chance of success. A number of Mr. Bush's California fund-raisers have now joined Mr. Simon's campaign.
But none of this has brought closer coordination between Mr. Simon and the White House. Perhaps the most conspicuous example was the way the candidate responded to the newly disclosed depth of California's budget crisis. Criticizing Mr. Davis, Mr. Simon said at the printing plant tour that any political leader who inherited a surplus and turned it into a big deficit ought to be thrown out of office. Asked if that applied to Mr. Bush, Mr. Simon sought to explain that the state and federal budgets were different and that the two officeholders had differing amounts of time to deal with the issue.
Mr. Russo insists that whether or not Mr. Bush and Mr. Simon see eye to eye, Mr. Bush needs the nominee, and his victory here, to help the president's own re-election prospects in 2004.
But Democratic strategists are growing more confident. They are researching business dealings by Mr. Simon's family in an effort to develop attacks against his record, and say they will hit him with a barrage of tough television advertisements this summer.
"I can tell you, come Nov. 5, Bill Simon will not be a pretty new face in California politics any longer," said Garry South, Mr. Davis's chief strategist. "This guy is a rank amateur."
Mr. Simon dismisses such talk.
"I'd like to stay away from what I call the old style of politics, the 'gotcha' politics," he said. "I'm interested in the new politics of opportunity."

HEADLINE: Online Travel Booking Site Files for Public Stock Sale 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
Orbitz Inc., the Internet travel booking site owned by the country's five largest airlines, filed for an initial stock offering yesterday that is intended to raise $125 million.
 Started in June 2001, Orbitz.com is the country's third-largest online booking site for airline tickets, rental cars, hotel rooms and other travel-related products. Its filing yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission did not say when the offering would take place or how many shares would be offered and at what price. 
 The lead underwriters are Goldman, Sachs and Credit Suisse First Boston; two other investment banks are taking part.
Orbitz has been engaged in a battle with Travelocity and Expedia for online bookings. In contrast to most other online business, the purchasing of travel online has been increasing. Airlines are encouraging travelers to book tickets over the Internet because it saves carriers the cost of printing and mailing tickets.
Many passengers have found that electronic tickets are more convenient, allowing them to bypass long lines at the check-in counter, especially after Sept. 11. More and more travelers are also going to Web sites to search for inexpensive last-minute fares that are often unavailable elsewhere.
Expedia is a public company that is mostly owned by USA Network; Travelocity was also public until it was bought by Sabre Holdings Corporation in March.
Orbitz is owned by five carriers that account for about 70 percent of domestic sales -- American Airlines, United Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines and Continental Airlines. That has led Orbitz's competitors and antitrust groups to criticize the company, saying it gives those airlines the opportunity to collude on fares and offer exclusive low fares on the Web site.
The Departments of Transportation and Justice are investigating the accusations, and some people are speculating that the offering is an effort by Orbitz to distance itself from its owners.
"By diluting the airlines' ownership, Orbitz becomes less controlled by the airlines and to a certain degree controlled by shareholders," said Henry Harteveldt, a travel industry analyst with Forrester Research. The offering by Orbitz comes as no surprise, he added, because "its five airline founders have invested substantial money in Orbitz, and they're all financially challenged right now.
"They're desperately seeking payback on their investment in Orbitz to shore up their own financial coffers," Mr. Harteveldt said.
Albert A. Foer, president of the American Antitrust Institute, a nonpartisan research organization, said that although Orbitz might be trying to distance itself from the carriers, it remained to be seen who would own controlling shares and who would appoint the directors.
"If the major airlines continue to appoint the board members and control the policy, then it won't reduce the concerns," Mr. Foer said. "If this were spun off to a company that had no airline ownership, then it would be a different animal."
It is not known when the federal government will conclude its investigations. Orbitz will almost certainly take that into consideration as it tries to select a date for its offering. The investigations could also influence the price.
As the American economy continues to struggle, discount travel options have become increasingly popular. Southwest Airlines and JetBlue have earned more profit this year than the larger carriers, which charge more for unrestricted fares. JetBlue's stock soared 67 percent after a public offering last month that raised $158.5 million.

HEADLINE: No Cuba Libre, No Trade 

 BODY:
President Bush's speech on the centennial of Cuban independence amounted to an invitation that Fidel Castro is almost certain to decline: Hold free elections and liberalize your economy, and we will trade with you. Coming on the heels of Jimmy Carter's trip to Havana, the speech was an unfortunate, if nuanced, reaffirmation of Mr. Bush's support for the counterproductive, four-decade-old economic sanctions and ban on travel to the island nation. 
 There were, to be sure, things to applaud in Mr. Bush's address, which he delivered before flying to Florida to speak to a Cuban-American rally and attend a fund-raiser for his brother Jeb, Florida's governor. Nobody can argue with the president's depiction of the Castro regime as an anachronistic Communist dictatorship, nor with his praise for Cuba's internal dissidents. 
 Mr. Bush also pledged to loosen restrictions on private humanitarian assistance offered Cubans, to seek a resumption of normal mail service and to finance scholarships for Cuban students to study in the United States. Moreover, the suggestion that his administration could someday normalize ties with Mr. Castro's regime -- provided the dictator ensures "certifiably free" National Assembly elections next year -- was a departure from the usual rhetoric that holds the passing from the scene of Washington's bearded old nemesis as a precondition for normalizing ties. 
Yet the fundamental principle of the Bush approach toward Cuba -- that normal trade relations are a reward for deserving democracies with free markets -- remains deeply flawed. That view is at odds with America's approach to much of the rest of the world, including China and Vietnam, where trade and foreign investment are rightly seen as a means of advancing economic reforms and democratization, not as a prize for them.
When the Senate voted in the fall of 2000 to fully normalize trade with China, Mr. Bush, then governor of Texas, issued an approving statement: "This measure will help open markets to American products and help export American values, especially freedom and entrepreneurship." Certifiably free local elections were not demanded from China. Cuba is a different case because of domestic political concerns, notably Florida's large Cuban-American electorate. 
There is an increasingly bipartisan clamor on Capitol Hill to lift sanctions against Cuba. American big business and American tourists are eager to launch a commercial invasion across the Straits of Florida, and it is hard to overstate their power to overwhelm Mr. Castro's control over all facets of the Cuban economy. It is also hard to overstate how deflated Mr. Castro's regime would become politically if it could no longer pose as the aggrieved victim of Yankee imperialism. That is the reason Cuba's most prominent dissidents favor lifting the embargo. Mr. Bush would do well to listen to them.

HEADLINE: Becoming Less German 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L.ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 20 

 BODY:
Ten years ago, it would never have occurred to anyone that a Swiss citizen could end up running a German powerhouse like Deutsche Bank. Today, the big question is whether a Swiss citizen can save it.
 When Josef Ackermann, a former chief executive at the Credit Suisse Group who arrived here in 1996, takes over on Wednesday as chief executive of Deutsche Bank, he will do so with three simple thoughts at the forefront. Bold new visions are out, cost-cutting is in -- and time is running short. 
 Deutsche Bank remains one of the biggest banks in the world, an institution with more than $800 billion in assets and tens of thousands of people working in London, on Wall Street, in Central Europe and in Asia.
But it is also an institution that is remarkably frail. Its profit margins are among the lowest and its costs are among the highest in the banking industry. Its $44 billion market capitalization, or total value to investors, is smaller than that of many European rivals and barely one-sixth that of Citigroup. Deutsche Bank's home market is stagnant, overcrowded and barely profitable. 
All of the German banks have had their profits wilt and their stock prices languish. Dresdner Bank became so feeble that it was taken over by its biggest shareholder, Allianz, and Commerzbank is a perpetual subject of takeover speculation.
In private meetings with top executives, Mr. Ackermann has warned that Deutsche must raise its stock price if it is to avoid being eclipsed. He has warned that executives have a matter of months, not years, to make their case with investors.
If the campaign fails, he says, the bank will at best be unable to make any big acquisitions. At worst, it could itself become a takeover target.
No one expects Deutsche Bank to fall victim to a foreign takeover any time soon. But the bank that used to be at the very heart of Germany Inc. has already ceased to be a German institution in many respects.
Mr. Ackermann, 54, is merely the most visible sign of the cultural shift. More than half of the bank's powerful new executive committee, led by Mr. Ackermann, are non-Germans and three of them are Americans.
English, not German, is the language in meetings of the executive committee as well as on the Vorstand, or management board. The bank's incoming media spokesman is British; he is not entirely comfortable speaking German.
The international complexion of the top management directly reflects the change in its business. Bank executives estimate that 85 percent of profits come from outside Germany; more than half of employees are elsewhere. Investment banking is now the engine of profits, and those operations are based in London and New York. Asset management and Swiss-style private banking are the other main pillars, and those are largely outside Germany, too.
The problem is that Deutsche Bank has not been able to trim its costs. Like Germany's other big banks, it remains bogged down by a home market that has too many banks fighting for too few profits.
Until now, the banks have been nervous about closing branches and losing market share, yet at the same time, they have not been able to solve their problems by merging with one another. Making matters worse, German economic growth has been the slowest in Europe for years and is nearly stagnant right now.
But German market woes do not explain the entire problem. Deutsche Bank, which has long considered itself the gold standard in banking, has high costs even in businesses outside the German market. Costs eat up 89 percent of income in transaction banking, 91 percent of income of private banking and 92 percent of income in asset management.
Those numbers make Deutsche Bank, at the moment, the least efficient of almost any big international bank -- worse than big Swiss rivals like UBS and Credit Suisse; much worse than American giants like Citigroup; and not even comparable to a brutally frugal institution like Lloyds TSB, the big British bank that has set the standard for European banks in cost-cutting.
Mr. Ackermann is already shaking up Deutsche Bank. Earlier this year, he pushed through a revamping that concentrates more power in an American-style chief executive and dilutes power in the consensus-driven management board.
The plan prompted one top board member to resign in protest, while German newspapers published scare articles about plans to move the headquarters from Frankfurt to London. But Mr. Ackermann prevailed, and he has clearly begun to crack the whip.
Last month, he announced plans to reduce annual costs by about $1.8 billion and to eliminate about 9,200 jobs. In league with his departing predecessor, Rolf E. Breuer, Mr. Ackermann has also moved to sell businesses that no longer fit with its basic strategy. Deutsche is selling the last of its insurance companies, as well as its securities services.
The third element of Mr. Ackermann's strategy is to accelerate the sale of Deutsche's huge pile of industrial holdings, which include a big stake in DaimlerChrysler, and to use the proceeds to buy back up to 20 percent of the bank's stock.
The combined effect of this new buzz has been to give Deutsche Bank shares an Ackermann lift based partly on the allure of a stock buyback and partly on the hope that the bank will finally do something about its high costs.
Still, Deutsche Bank has announced so many cost-reduction plans over the last five years, only to see its costs eat away even more profit, that investors are profoundly skeptical.
"The omens look better now than they have in a long time," said Stuart O. Graham, banking analyst at J. P. Morgan in London. "But the market is going to benchmark these guys very closely on cost control, and their track record on that is not great."
In the last few weeks, Deutsche Bank shares have risen faster than the market. Mr. Graham estimates that the recent lift reflects a belief that Mr. Ackermann will pull off only about half the $1.8 billion in savings he has advertised. Shares closed down fractionally today, to 77.45 euros ($71.28).
Though soft spoken and eager to avoid the limelight, Mr. Ackermann has won praise as a tough-minded and shrewd executive. Until recently, he spent nearly all his time in London and New York, where he also owns a home.
But these days, he has been telegraphing a very different message: not only will the base remain in Frankfurt, but the bank will hold on to its unprofitable retail banking business in Germany.
The problem is how to keep up with the competition. Bank executives confirm that Deutsche held merger discussions two years ago with Lloyds TSB before Deutsche concluded that the two did not make a good fit. Since then, Lloyd's market value has become far higher than Deutsche's.
"The problem now is that they can't do a deal because it would amount to being taken over," said one senior executive who recently left the bank.
That is why Mr. Ackermann has placed such a high priority on raising Deutsche Bank's stock price. And his only tool for doing that right now is reducing costs and raising profits. Surprisingly, at least a few of Deutsche's sharpest critics think Mr. Ackermann has a chance. 
"The new C.E.O. and the people around him seem more pragmatic, more focused," said Mark Hoge, banking analyst at Banc of America Securities in London. Almost every bank in Germany, he added, has belatedly come to the realization that it has to cut costs drastically.
"This time," Mr. Hoge said, "I believe they will deliver -- and that is a major change from our view in the past."

HEADLINE: EMBARGO REMAINS UNTIL CUBA ALTERS POLICY, BUSH SAYS 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH BUMILLER 

DATELINE: MIAMI, May 20 

 BODY:
President Bush, in a speech harshly critical of Fidel Castro, said today that he would not lift a trade embargo against Cuba without substantial movement toward democracy there.
 His remarks were greeted by roars of approval from thousands of Cuban-Americans in a state that is critical to the president's re-election campaign in 2004. 
 "Nearly a half century ago, Cuba's independence and the hopes for democracy were hijacked by a brutal dictator who cares everything for his own power and nada for the Cuban people," Mr. Bush said. "In an era where markets have brought prosperity and empowerment, this leader clings to a bankrupt ideology that has brought Cuba's workers and farmers and families nothing -- nothing -- but isolation and misery." 
Mr. Bush's remarks, made on the 100th anniversary of Cuban independence, placed him in direct opposition to the recommendations made by former President Jimmy Carter, who called for an easing of the economic sanctions last week when he became the most prominent American politician to visit the island since Mr. Castro took power in 1959.
The president's pronouncements were also at odds with Democrats and a number of Republicans in Congress, who consider an approach that Mr. Castro has survived for more than four decades to be outdated and ineffective.
But Mr. Bush said that he would only consider lifting the embargo, as well as travel restrictions to the island, if Mr. Castro met a broad variety of democratic and economic changes. 
"Then, and only then, I will explore ways with the United States Congress to ease economic sanctions," Mr. Bush said, to chants from the crowd of "Libertad! Libertad!" 
The president also threatened to veto any attempt by Congress to ease trade restrictions to the island. Republicans from farm states have been pushing for liberalized trade with Cuba, and two years ago Congress passed a measure allowing food exports to Cuba, though anti-Castro lawmakers placed a number of restrictions on those sales.
"I want you to know that I know what trade means with a tyrant," Mr. Bush said. "It means that we will underwrite tyranny, and we cannot let that happen."
This morning at the White House, the president said that Mr. Castro -- Mr. Bush never once referred to him as "President Castro" -- had "turned a beautiful island into a prison."
Mr. Bush's remarks at the James L. Knight Center here were a more rollicking version of his speech earlier in the day at the White House, and the result of a five-month administration review of Cuba policy. 
Mr. Bush laid out a long list of conditions that Cuba must meet before his administration would consider a change of policy. Specifically, the president demanded that Mr. Castro release all political prisoners and give opposition political candidates in Cuba's National Assembly elections in 2003 the freedom to organize, assemble and speak. 
"For 43 years, every election in Cuba has been a fraud and a sham," Mr. Bush said. "Mr. Castro, once, just once, show that you're unafraid of a real election."
Mr. Bush also demanded that Mr. Castro allow international human rights organizations to monitor those elections. 
The president's remarks drew criticism from Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut. "President Bush has set forth a laundry list of actions that the Castro government must take before the U.S. takes even one step toward modifying U.S. policies," he said in a statement. "By doing so, he has guaranteed that the current political system in Cuba will remain the same -- as it has for the last 40 years that the U.S. has pursued this ill-advised policy."
But the president's position was enthusiastically applauded today by huge numbers of Cuban-Americans, who were essential to Mr. Bush's slender victory in Florida, and the presidential election, in 2000. The Cuban-American community is also important to this year's re-election campaign of the president's younger brother Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida.
Tonight the brothers were the guests of honor at a $2 million fund-raiser for the Florida Republican Party at the Coral Gables home of Armando Codina, a Cuban-American real estate developer and a former business partner of Jeb Bush. Contributors paid $25,000 per couple to attend, and most of the money was expected to go to Jeb Bush's campaign. The White House closed the event to the news media.
While underscoring a hard line toward Cuba, the president did say that he would take some minor steps to ease life for Cubans living under the Castro regime. He said that his administration would support private organizations that aid Cuba, and that it would provide scholarships in the United States to Cuban students, professionals and children of political prisoners. 
In addition, Mr. Bush said that he was willing to negotiate resuming direct mail service between the United States and Cuba, and that he would "continue to look for ways" to modernize Radio and TV Marti, American government broadcasts in Cuba.
But Mr. Dodd, for one, dismissed the administration's proposals as "much ado about nothing" and said direct mail service and scholarship programs for Cuban students were unlikely to happen without the cooperation of the Cuban government.
Mr. Bush's speech today was delivered at a sometimes raucous event where Jeb Bush delivered remarks almost entirely in Spanish and Gloria Estefan sang the Cuban national anthem. "Ironically, the citizens of Cuba are still waiting for the freedoms embodied in this anthem," Ms. Estefan said from the stage.
Several times, the president inserted in his own remarks Spanish somewhat less practiced than his brother's, including the line "No quiero destriur un idioma que bonita, y por eso voy a hablar en ingles" -- "I don't want to destroy a beautiful language, so I'm going to speak in English."
The crowd interrupted the president's remarks frequently with huge waves of applause, particularly when Mr. Bush said that his administration would continue to bar tourist travel to Cuba. (People with professional business or family ties in Cuba are permitted to go.) 
Despite predictions last week that Mr. Bush would further restrict travel to Cuba, the president made no mention of that today. But a senior administration official with the president on Air Force One said the White House might still impose further restrictions on travel. "As we move on throughout the year, we're going to be looking at all steps at our disposal," the official said.
The official also said that Mr. Bush's speech was about foreign policy, not domestic politics. Asked if Jeb Bush had any input into the president's speech, the official said, "Not to my knowledge, no."

HEADLINE: Big Blimp That Apparently Couldn't 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: BERLIN, May 20 

 BODY:
Carl von Gablenz, the founder of Cargolifter A.G., had more than just a big idea. He had a gigantic and enchanting and almost quintessentially German idea.
 Blimps. A blimp that would be longer than two football fields. A helium-filled blimp so big that it would be able to carry a 100-ton oil rig to the frozen Arctic tundra or a power-plant turbine to the Amazon rain forest. It would be an "air crane," lifting more than any helicopter and reaching more places than any truck, ship, train or plane. 
 But 65 years after the Hindenburg exploded over New Jersey and effectively ended the era of the zeppelin, Mr. Von Gablenz's dream of lighter-than-air transportation is crashing and burning as well.
Having raised and spent more than $250 million in the last five years, he now presides over a mammoth hangar on an abandoned Russian military airfield 40 miles outside Berlin. But he has exhausted his money and the patience of investors.
His flagship flying machine, the 160-ton-capacity self-propelled blimp, needs another $300 million and is now on ice. His backup idea -- a giant balloon that can lift 75 tons -- needs another $50 million or so.
"People only ask me about the burn rate, about the money, about the time we need," Mr. Gablenz grumbled in a recent interview. "But we have made many new advances with the technology, and we know there is even more potential than we first thought.
"People don't ask about that."
Cargolifter's story is a piquant fillip to the dashed dreams of the dot-com bust. Here, too, was a company that went public on a vision and a technology. Here, too, was an entrepreneur who was a master at selling.
The difference was that this vision seemed concrete, logical and elegantly simple. Anyone could understand "the power of zero gravity."
That apparent simplicity was deceiving. Transportation experts say that in hindsight the concept was much harder to make workable than Mr. Von Gablenz or his investors ever understood. "It is easy to get this up in the air," said Peter Klaus, a professor of business logistics at the University of Erlangen-Nurenburg who has followed Cargolifter closely. "The problem is when you come back down."
An immense helium balloon can indeed hoist up gigantic payloads. But when it comes time to lower and then release the oil rig or power turbine, engineers had to figure out how to keep the airship from shooting skyward the moment it released the enormous weight.
Cargolifter designed ballast tanks that can be pumped with up to 160 tons of water as the unloading progresses. But that assumes 160 tons of water are available, which may not be the case in the Siberian tundra or the Sahara.
Then there is the problem of keeping a 100-ton piece of delicate engineering equipment from swinging and drifting as it dangles from the airship during unloading. "This isn't something that would happen in a few minutes," Mr. Klaus said. "This is something that would take hours."
Cargolifter executives say extensive studies have confirmed their concept. The company has built a working scale model of the 160-ton-capacity airship and a full-size prototype of the 75-ton balloon, which is almost 70 yards across.
Still, in its annual report last year, it noted that "combining an airship with a crane constitutes an enormous technical challenge" and that it would not be known until 2004 or later if the airships would be viable.
Mr. Von Gablenz, meanwhile, has run through money faster than he hoped. A former logistics executive and professor, who worked out his basic ideas on a sabbatical in North Carolina, Mr. Von Gablenz started Cargolifter in 1996 and raised more than $150 million privately. He got land and more than $30 million in cash assistance from the German state of Brandenburg to build the hangar.
It was a huge achievement in persuasion, especially in a country as habitually risk averse as Germany. But fascination with technology and entrepreneurship took hold here as well, and Cargolifter raised nearly $60 million more in a May 2000 public stock offering.
The company benefited from constant media attention. Its gleaming hangar is a photographer's dream. The idea of a modern zeppelin was easy and appealing to describe. Cargolifter shares jumped from 13 euros ($11.98), to more than 25 euros, within months.
But with the end of bull-market euphoria, Cargolifter's stock plunged along with countless other new companies, disrupting Mr. Von Gablenz's plans.
He knew from the beginning that the company would need more money before its airships were ready for business, he said, but he assumed that the markets would provide that money if he kept showing progress.
Mr. Von Gablenz said he made enormous strides by building the hangar and the prototypes, carrying out tests and signing up component suppliers. "The only thing that really did not work out according to plan was the market," he said ruefully.
That is not quite true: Earlier this year, Mr. Von Gablenz increased his estimate of how much more money he would need from about 300 million euros ($276 million) to 420 million euros ($387 million). An internal consulting report suggested that the gap could be more than 500 million euros ($461 million).
Cargolifter is far from finding it. The company tried to raise 50 million euros this month through a convertible bond offering, but received subscriptions for fewer than 4 million. Brandenburg, with money problems of its own, refused to contribute any more unless the German federal government joined in, but last week, the economics ministry refused.
Company officials refuse to say how much money they have left. Work has all but stopped, and bankruptcy appears imminent.
There are still a few glimmers of hope. A few weeks ago, the Boeing Company's technology-scouting subsidiary signed a letter of intent to explore new ideas based on Cargolifter's technology. The deal involves only a study of technical possibilities, but it could at some point lead to an investment.
Heinrich Grossbondant, a spokesman for Boeing in Hamburg, said his company was not interested in cargo carriers but might have other uses for lighter-than-air craft.
"One idea would be to put an airship 20 kilometers high as a surveillance platform and just have it stay in one place," he said. "No other company has spent as much energy and money on lighter-than-air technology in the last few years. That's where they probably acquired some valuable knowledge."
If all else fails, there is still tourism. Cargolifter may not have gotten off the ground, but its hangar and museum attract busloads of gawking tourists almost every day -- about 330,000 people so far -- who have paid 10 euros a ticket. The vision, at least, has not yet died.

San Diego's High-Rise Slump Lingers

BYLINE:  By KEVIN BRASS 

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO 

 BODY:
After 10 years without any high-rise office construction, this city's dormant downtown market showed signs of life last year. Two developers, using almost identical language, announced plans to build the first Class A office towers in San Diego in a decade.
 Both projects have been delayed, however, as the developers struggle with the lingering effects of a downtown office building boom in the late 1980's and early 1990's. 
 In 1989 to 1991 alone, five high-rise headquarters towers were completed downtown, financed primarily by locally based savings and loan associations. The subsequent contraction of the savings and loan industry left downtown San Diego with millions of square feet of unused office space. 
More than two million square feet emptied out during a single 12-month period, according to Bradford Perry, vice president of Burnham Real Estate Services. Through much of the decade, more than 20 percent of the office space downtown was empty.
The rest of San Diego County's office markets, meanwhile, were rapidly expanding, particularly in the city's northern region. Fast-growing high-technology companies, primarily in the wireless communications and biotechnology sectors, preferred the "campus" environments of suburban office complexes. Law firms, accountants and other service companies migrated to the suburbs, following the new companies.
In the last 10 years, more than 15 million square feet of office space was built in the county, almost none of it downtown, said Gary London, a San Diego-based real estate analyst.
The Catellus Urban Development Group, one of the companies that announced plans to build an office tower starting this spring, originally received city approval in 1993 to build office towers as part of Santa Fe Place, a commercial and residential complex covering six city blocks near San Diego Bay. But with downtown vacancy rates soaring, the office element of the project was shelved. Part of the parcel was converted into a golf driving range.
Then, in 2000, the downtown vacancy rate fell below 10 percent for the first time in 10 years. Expecting an upturn in the market, Catellus spent $3 million to design and market the office complex. The first phase would be a 440-foot, 27-story tower with 458,000 square feet of office space, and a second 20-story tower with 373,900 square feet would follow. 
But the office project was delayed after Catellus was unable to find tenants willing to pay the $39 a square foot annually that the company needed to make the project economically feasible, said William B. Scott Jr., senior vice president for San Diego development at the Catellus Urban Development Group, which is a subsidiary of the Catellus Development Corporation, a publicly traded company based in San Francisco.
"The market was at a point where rents downtown were heading up," Mr. Scott said. "Unfortunately, the trend settled back in the other direction."
The other company that has announced plans to build an office tower, the San Diego-based Lankford & Associates, now appears closer to starting construction.
Although the company missed a spring target date after a tenant backed out, it now expects to break ground in October on a 26-story, 460-foot tower near the city's new courthouse complex, according to Robert V. Lankford, president and chief executive of Lankford & Associates.
The project, called Broadway 655, is to have 430,000 square feet of office space and 13,000 square feet of retail space, as well as a four-story residential building. Several companies have committed themselves to lease space in the project, including the law firm of Milberg Weiss Bershad Hynes & Lerach, which has agreed to occupy 113,000 square feet in the top six floors of the tower. 
Prelease tenants are paying $36 to $38.50 a square foot annually in the Broadway tower, Mr. Lankford said. With space readily available, in recent years downtown landlords have rarely been able to get more than $30 a square foot, according to local real estate analysts.
Developers like Mr. Lankford hope a spurt of residential development downtown will help to revive the office market.
A total of 5,800 new housing units are currently in development downtown -- 1,800 planned as single-family homes and 4,000 apartments -- according to Russell T. Valone II, president of MarketPoint Realty Advisors, a San Diego-based company that tracks residential markets.
Last year, Catellus sold two parcels totaling 120,000 square feet, part of its downtown master plan, to Bosa Development of Vancouver, British Columbia, for $26.5 million. In April, Bosa started construction of a 410-foot, 39-story tower to house condominiums on one of the parcels.
Coupled with new shopping and restaurant developments, the residential development is part of the "Manhattanization" of downtown, according to Mr. London, the real estate analyst. He says increasing traffic jams on the city's northern roads will lead people to look for places where they can live and work in the same area.
"Employment-based development downtown will see a whole new set of dynamics over the next five years," Mr. London said.
Plans are also moving forward to redevelop the southeastern portion of downtown around the construction of a new ballpark to house the San Diego Padres. After several legal challenges, construction has resumed on the stadium, which is expected to be completed in 2004.
Two low-rise office complexes are in development near the site of the new baseball park. Almost 100,000 square feet of the space is already preleased, according to Mr. Perry of Burnham Real Estate Services, which oversees the leasing and marketing of the ballpark area's office space controlled by JMI Realty, owned by John Moores, the majority owner of the Padres.
But the city has been frustrated in its efforts to encourage high-rise office development. "We would much rather see high-rise than low-rise or uneconomical use of the land," said Bradley Richter, principal planner for the Center City Development Corporation, the city's downtown redevelopment agency.
Despite picturesque bayfront locations, San Diego developers have found it difficult to persuade companies from other areas to relocate downtown. About a year ago, Sun Microsystems, the maker of computer networking equipment and software based in Santa Clara, Calif., was expected to take more than a million square feet of downtown office space, but it dropped the plan when the economy changed.
"We're not seeing a lot of interest in a new migration to the market in the whole county, not just downtown," Mr. Lankford said.
In the face of this lack of activity, downtown business owners, including Catellus and Lankford, have banded together with local economic development agencies to undertake a new marketing effort. The group will focus on trying to attract companies from other metropolitan areas to downtown.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE: NEW ROCHELLE, N.Y.; 
Mall in Need Is Provided A Face-Lift For $500,000

BYLINE:  By EDWIN McDOWELL 

 BODY:
Since the Wykagyl Shopping Center opened half a century ago on North Avenue in the northern section of New Rochelle, it has always looked much the same -- until very recently. Now the shopping center has been given a makeover that seeks, with minimum interference to the operation of the stores, to update its look in a striking way. 
 The old North Avenue train station has long since gone and malls and shopping centers have sprung up nearby, but people from the neighborhood have continued to patronize the 25,000-square-foot shopping center. The property has always been profitable, according to Jean Minskoff Grant, who manages the mall with her husband, Francis T. Grant. But several years ago, Ms. Grant mentioned to a neighbor, Wendy Evans Joseph, who owns Wendy Evans Joseph Architecture in Manhattan, that the mall looked tired. Then in 2000 Ms. Joseph's firm was given the go-ahead for the $500,000 makeover. 
 Their design produced what Robert G. Furno, an architect in the firm, described as "architecture as advertising." 
Along with a new entry pylon with signs, the architects added an aluminum facade and they redesigned the roof-mounted lighting system with 28 rooftop high-intensity metal halide lights that go on and off automatically, thus providing additional security, safety and unobtrusive advertising, illuminating the store signs. The lighting system, which cost $25,000, will pay for itself in about six years through the savings compared with the cost of incandescent lighting fixtures. The sidewalks are scheduled for repaving this summer. 
But the most striking feature of the redesigned mall is the undulating anodized aluminum panels affixed to the facade of the single-story building: a series of stacked narrow 10-foot-long panels near roof level along the front running from the Starbucks at one end of the L-shaped mall to the Oshlag-Eisner Realty Corporation office at the other end. The panels are fitted over brackets attached to the facade, a process that saved on construction costs. 
Anodized aluminum was chosen, Ms. Joseph said, because "it never rusts or changes, it's lightweight, easily prefabricated and an economical choice." The use of prefabricated aluminum enabled the contractor, Lyons-Minskoff Inc. of Manhattan, to complete the makeover in a relatively short four months, she added. But it took some time to find a company that knew how to work with prefabricated aluminum before the contractor settled on We Build Inc. in Mount Vernon, N.Y.
The changes were made without requiring any work on the interiors of the existing buildings, which would have been expensive and time-consuming, and the center remained open while the work was being done. Rather than change the individual lettering on each of the eight existing stores, which include a cleaner, a pizzeria, an Italian restaurant, a clothing store for women and girls, a toy store and a combination greengrocer and deli, the architects suggested that the stores retain their original lettering. (A ninth store is empty, awaiting a tenant.) "Changing the lettering would have been too much of a cliche for such a radical design, so we encouraged people to do things their own way," Mr. Furno said. 
Ms. Grant is an owner and president of the Minskoff Grant Realty and Management Corporation; her husband is chief executive. She is the granddaughter of Sam Minskoff, a noted real estate developer, whose company developed Wykagyl Shopping Center and many apartment buildings, office buildings and shopping centers in New York and its suburbs, as well as in Baltimore, Detroit and Philadelphia. The Minskoffs also built the Minskoff Theater on Broadway.
While this is Joseph Architecture's first shopping center, the eight-employee firm has designed a variety of projects in its six years of existence. One notable effort was Ms. Joseph's design of a pedestrian bridge over 63rd Street, linking the residential and scientific areas of the Rockefeller University campus in Manhattan. It is the only cantilevered bridge in New York City, she said, and its cables are parallel, in what is known as a harp arrangement. The bridge's design has won awards from the American Institute of Architects, the Engineering Society, Business Week/Architectural Record and Construction News magazine.
If it were up to Frances Eisner, the president of the Oshlang-Eisner Realty Corporation, who has been a tenant in the mall since 1961, Joseph Architecture would also win awards for what she praised as its "futuristic" makeover of the Wykagyl Shopping Center.
"They took an undistinguished shopping center and made it into something that's part of the contemporary world," Mrs. Eisner said, "and that's very appealing to me."

HEADLINE: Sharon's Domestic Battle: A Gamble 

BYLINE:  By JAMES BENNET 

DATELINE: TEL AVIV, May 21 

 BODY:
As a soldier, Ariel Sharon had a reputation for defying odds and orders, brashly gambling on his own judgment and sometimes losing as big as, at other times, he won.
 Late Monday night, he gambled again, astonishing ministers of a scrupulously religious Sephardic party by kicking them out of his government despite their importance to his coalition. Mr. Sharon acted after the party, Shas, voted against his proposed emergency economic package, intended to address a budget deficit caused in large measure by the military offensive he recently ordered in the West Bank. 
 Mr. Sharon also shoved out deputy ministers of a smaller party, United Torah Judaism, that had also opposed his budget plan. The plan was narrowly defeated in the Parliament. 
Defying common political wisdom, which predicted a face-saving compromise, Mr. Sharon continued tonight to swat aside any suggestion of a deal. He was said to have instructed supporters not to take calls from Shas members seeking a compromise to stay in the government. The dismissals do not go into effect until Wednesday.
Mr. Sharon's brinkmanship was sure to impress Israelis as brave, political analysts said, but it also threatened to leave his government with barely enough certain votes in the Parliament to stave off new elections.
If Mr. Sharon becomes embroiled in a fight for political survival, efforts by the Bush administration, Saudi Arabia and other governments to press for peace here would probably be stymied for months.
His dismissal of the ministers was consistent with Mr. Sharon's take-it-or-leave-it approach to being prime minister. Just in the last two months, he has conducted Israel's biggest military operation in 20 years; defied the United Nations; defied his own party's central leadership, and resisted pressure from the Bush administration. 
The long-term consequences of these actions are far from certain, but for now Palestinian attacks on Israelis have subsided, Palestinian criticism of Yasir Arafat has grown and Mr. Sharon's popularity among Israelis has soared.
"It was very courageous to make such a decision," Moshe Lissak, a sociologist at Hebrew University, said of Mr. Sharon's treatment of Shas. "Shas is a party which actually brought him most of his votes, beyond the Likud," which is Mr. Sharon's party.
Just over a week ago, Mr. Sharon rejected a decision by the Likud's central committee to oppose any Palestinian state west of the Jordan River, though he is in no hurry to create such a state himself. Earlier, he successfully beat back a proposed United Nations mission of inquiry into the fighting in the Jenin refugee camp in April. He said the planned investigation was biased.
Mr. Sharon resisted the Bush administration's calls for a withdrawal, and Israeli troops are still operating in Palestinian-controlled territory in the West Bank.
Rather than easing Israel's blockade of Palestinian areas, Mr. Sharon is tightening it, using barbed wire and restricted permits to limit dramatically Palestinians' movement through the West Bank. On April 4, President Bush declared, "Israel should take immediate action to ease closures and allow peaceful people to go back to work."
Mr. Lissak said that the public would overwhelmingly support the treatment of Shas, because, although Shas presents itself as the guardian of the poor, it is viewed as a blinkered interest group, jealously protecting state subsidies for its constituency.
Shas broke with Mr. Sharon over his plans to reduce subsidies for families with more than two children. Devout Jewish families tend to have many children.
The Parliament was expected to vote again on Wednesday on the budget measure, and Mr. Sharon indicated that he would then permit negotiations with the renegade parties.
There was a palpable sense of pleasure among some politicians over the humbling of Shas, a pivotal swing party that helped bring down the previous prime minister, Ehud Barak. "We'll get along without Shas," said Zeev Boim, the Likud whip in the Parliament.
Asher Arian, a political scientist at Haifa University and the City University of New York, predicted that Mr. Sharon would ultimately reach a deal to hold on to Shas. "What we know is that no government in Israel ever fell over budgetary matters," he said.
"The pivotal party in Israeli politics today is Shas," he added. "You cannot really have a stable long-term coalition without them."
Although it is in dismal condition, the economy is not the political trump card here that it is in the United States. Even when only a small minority of the public has expressed approval of Mr. Sharon's handling of the economy, large majorities have approved of his overall performance. Here, it is a prime minister's handling of security that determines if his popularity, and his government, rises or falls.
Without Shas, Mr. Sharon would be more dependent on the restive, left-leaning Labor party to sustain his government, and it might break with him over his more hawkish policies.
"He knows that he needs the support of Shas in the confrontation with the Palestinians," Mr. Lissak said. Mr. Sharon's Likud allies were on the prowl today for other potential members to bolster the coalition. One possible new partner was Shinui, a secular centrist party.
Mr. Sharon's government has been an uneasy assortment of unlikely partners, ranging from Labor, which supports an eventual Palestinian state, to the National Religious Party, which represents the interests of settlers in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
For 14 months, Mr. Sharon has been successful in sustaining this coalition, partly by arguing that national unity is now a strategic necessity. But with the fighting having eased somewhat for the moment, ministers might feel freer to break with the prime minister.
In brief remarks today, Mr. Sharon suggested that he had little patience for opponents. "Look, we are facing a difficult campaign, both a difficult security campaign and an economic campaign," he said, while touring a navy base in Haifa.
Before this dispute, Mr. Sharon had a governing coalition of 82 seats in the 120-member Parliament. Shas's departure would cost him 17 seats, and the loss of United Torah Judaism another 5, reducing him to just 60 seats. That could leave him just a seat away from losing a no-confidence vote, which would force new elections.
After suggesting this morning that he was interested in reconciling, Eli Yishai, Shas's leader, sounded a tougher note on television tonight. "If the prime minister wants elections, we'll go to elections," he said.
In a remark that echoed, perhaps unconsciously, opposition criticism of the government's approach to security, Silvan Shalom, the finance minister, complained this morning about the selfishness of those who opposed the economic package. "Everyone who today tries to maintain his own little God-given plot of land will see that there will be nothing left to watch over," he said.

HEADLINE: 2 Retailers' Earnings Are Up 

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Two big retailers, Home Depot Inc. and the Target Corporation, said yesterday that their quarterly earnings rose as the companies reined in expenses and kept inventory levels low.
 Still, shares of Home Depot fell 7 percent on concerns that the company did not raise its forecast for the current quarter or full year and that sales at stores open at least a year did not meet some expectations. 
 Home Depot ordered goods through its headquarters instead of nine regional offices, while Target controlled inventories to avoid price cuts. Retailers are looking for ways to trim expenses amid concerns that consumer spending, having kept up through the recession, may moderate. 
"The retailers are cautious like the rest of us and are putting particular emphasis on controlling inventory," said James Luke, who manages the $200 million BB&T Large Company Growth Fund.
Net income at Home Depot rose 35 percent, to $856 million, or 36 cents a share, from $632 million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in the quarter ended May 5 increased 17 percent, to $14.3 billion, from $12.2 billion.
Profit at Target climbed 36 percent, to $345 million, or 38 cents a share, from $254 million, or 28 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in the period ended May 4, including credit card fees, increased 15 percent, to $9.59 billion, from $8.33 billion. 
Shares of Home Depot, which is based in Atlanta, dropped $3.60 yesterday to $44.90, after the company reported that same-store sales rose 5 percent. Some analysts had expected a gain as great as 8 percent. 
Same-store sales are expected to rise 2 percent to 4 percent this quarter, executives said in a conference call with investors. Home Depot said it expected to meet a 47-cent second-quarter profit estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial/First Call.
Shares of Target, formerly Dayton Hudson, based in Minneapolis, fell $1.16 yesterday, to $41.54. The company said it expected to meet estimates this quarter and added that profit for the year would be $1.80, or 1 cent less than analysts' average estimate.
Total retail sales at Target rose 14 percent, to $9.34 billion, including a 19 percent gain at the Target Stores division. Sales at stores open at least a year increased 5.2 percent.

HEADLINE: U.S. Approves Aid Resumption for Yugoslavia 

BYLINE:  Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21 

 BODY:
The United States announced today that it was ending a freeze on economic aid to Yugoslavia. The aid was suspended on March 31 because of Belgrade's failure to cooperate fully with the United Nations war crimes tribunal in The Hague.
 Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said that in light of increased cooperation between Belgrade and the court, he had approved a resumption of aid. The country, now made up of Serbia and Montenegro, has been devastated by years of war. 
 At stake is $40 million in aid this year. More important is the resumption of support for Belgrade in international lending groups, where Washington's vote is often crucial. Only last week, for example, the United States voted in the International Monetary Fund against a loan to Yugoslavia; the no vote was required because of the aid freeze.
The secretary spoke to reporters after a visit from Zoran Djindjic, prime minister of Serbia, and the Yugoslav foreign minister, Goran Svilanovic. "We take this as an acknowledgment for what we did in the last year and a half," Mr. Svilanovic said. "This will continue."
The two men are reformers who took office after the ouster of President Slobodan Milosevic in 2000. He is now on trial in The Hague.
Secretary Powell said he had acted "on the basis of new laws that have been passed in Belgrade, voluntary surrenders that have taken place and indictments that have been issued to those who remain still outside the jurisdiction of the tribunal."
Last month the Belgrade government told suspects wanted for atrocities in the Balkan wars to surrender or face arrest. Six heeded the call; about 18 are at large.
Two of those still wanted are the wartime Bosnian Serb leader, Dr. Radovan Karadzic, and his military commander, Gen. Ratko Mladic. Their whereabouts are not publicly known.
But Mr. Djindjic appeared optimistic that there would be further action soon. "Now the police should do its job and find these people and transfer them to The Hague, and I'm sure it will happen very soon," he said.
Human Rights Watch criticized the resumption of aid, saying Belgrade was still hindering the tribunal in The Hague by failing to provide archive materials to the prosecution.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS AND BONDS; 
Shares Fall a 2nd Day; Home Depot Outlook Is a Factor

BYLINE:  By Reuters 

 BODY:
Shares slumped for the second consecutive session yesterday after a disappointing profit forecast from Home Depot and renewed worries about the possibility of more attacks on the United States. 
 Stocks touched lows for the session after a law enforcement official said New York City might issue alerts about possible terrorist threats over the Memorial Day weekend. 
 Investors are also nervous about slack corporate profits and high share prices after last week's rally that drove technology stocks up almost 9 percent -- the biggest one-week gain this year. 
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 123.79 points, or 1.2 percent, to 10,105.71. The broader Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 12 points, or 1.1 percent, at 1,079.88. The technology-heavy Nasdaq index slipped 37.41 points, or 2.2 percent, to 1,664.18. 
Merrill Lynch was up 47 cents, to $43.85, after it agreed to pay $100 million to settle charges it misled investors by tailoring its research to please investment banking clients. 
Home Depot fell $3.53, or 7.3 percent, to $44.90. Home Depot posted quarterly earnings yesterday that rose 35 percent, aided by cost-cutting and an early start to the gardening season. But investors worried that Home Depot's rate of growth was slowing, compared with its rival Lowe's, which said on Monday that it expected to top analysts' estimates for the year. Lowe's stock fell 67 cents, to $46.13.
"Home Depot is a big catalyst," said Michael O'Hare, head of block trading at Lehman Brothers. "It was a disappointment, and it's taking the wind out of retailers, which have driven this market." 
Terrorism fears weighed on stocks, as the New York warning showed. Investors said more attacks could hurt consumer confidence, leading to less spending and travel, which in turn could hurt corporate profits. 
Ford Motor emerged as a bright spot yesterday, gaining 85 cents, to $17.58. Merrill Lynch raised its investment opinion on Ford and said that its turnaround plan, which calls for $7 billion in profits by mid-decade, is on track. --------------------

HEADLINE: Bill to Raise City Revenues Stalls in Albany 

BYLINE:  By SHAILA K. DEWAN and DIANE CARDWELL 

 BODY:
A bill that would net the city $400 million through an increase in the cigarette tax to $1.50 a pack and other measures is stalled in Albany until at least next week.
 Last week, legislative leaders presented the city's package as a sure thing, saying it would be passed early this week and enumerating the measures that would be included, from refinancing debt to raising parking violation fines. 
 But the bill has not materialized, and today, as a more combustible battle over control of the schools and money for Lower Manhattan played out, the reasons seemed many.
Some lawmakers suggested that the City Council, in a disagreement with the mayor over the city budget, was holding things up. There clearly were bitter words exchanged between the Republican leaders of the Senate and the Democratic leaders of the Assembly. Others suggested that the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, was holding up the tax package because he was unhappy with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg over the breakdown in talks for control of the schools. 
Assembly officials began the day by suggesting that reporters should go to a noon news conference with Joseph L. Bruno, the Senate majority leader, prepared to ask if his views had changed on certain aspects of the city's wish list, the intimation being that the Senate was holding up the bill.
But Senator Bruno said that his position had not changed. He placed the blame for the delay on both the Assembly and the City Council. The Assembly has asked for a home rule message -- in effect a formal request that the measures be passed -- from the Council.
Senator Bruno suggested that the request was simply a stalling tactic. "We don't think we need a home rule message to do what the city would like to have done. And we're prepared to act on it, but the Assembly is not prepared to act on it and I sure hope that they have not tied that in any way with anything else because that would be a disservice to the people of the city."
He added: "We haven't changed our position. We're waiting to hear from the city."
Mr. Silver responded angrily later in the day to accusations that he was the impediment. "In fact, it is Senator Bruno who's angry at the mayor and has held it up today," Mr. Silver said. He added that the sticking point was whether Lower Manhattan should be included in a federal economic stimulus package."Senator Bruno, through his agents, objects to that, and that's what is holding up the bill," Mr. Silver said.
As for the home-rule message, Council officials have steadfastly maintained that Albany must act first. Christopher Policano, the Council's chief spokesman, said that the Council's wishes had been clear for months. The Council has proposed several new taxes that the mayor has adamantly refused to ask Albany to approve in an election year, including an educational surcharge on the personal income tax, a liquor sales tax and a restoration of the commuter tax.
Weeks ago, Mr. Policano said, state officials announced an agreement on a budget package that included "certain details that need a home rule message." But not until the package is introduced as legislation in Albany, he insisted.
Still, Senate and Assembly leaders said they were looking for a less formal list from the mayor and the Council.
But the mayor's laundry list has been on the table for months. One city official involved in working with state legislators said: "We know what we want in the bill. They know what they want in the bill. This is an issue between the two houses. It has nothing to do with us. We're waiting for a bill print.".

HEADLINE: University Announces Ban on Fraternities and Sororities 

BYLINE:  By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
Benjamin Klein was a 21-year-old junior from Putney, Vt., majoring in economics at Alfred University in western New York State. He sang, he was the principal second violinist in the university orchestra, and was a member of one of the university's eight fraternities, Zeta Beta Tau. In February, his body was found in a creek behind the town post office. The university suspended his fraternity as it looked into reports that fraternity brothers had beaten him.
 Although the medical examiner said that his death was not a direct result of a beating, the incident led to a decision by Alfred University's trustees to examine the college's fraternity and sorority system. Last Friday, after receiving a sharply critical report from a task force they appointed, the trustees voted to end fraternities and sororities at Alfred. 
 "The Greek system is beyond repair," said Robert McComsey, the chairman of Alfred's board. "From this report, it became clear to all of us that our Greek system simply does not contribute to the type of learning environment we want at Alfred University."
With the vote, announced yesterday, Alfred became one of a small but growing number of colleges that have banned Greek life on campus. Critics say the fraternity system leads to drinking, hazing and other dangerous practices that sometimes result in death. Many campus officials also say that the fraternity and sorority houses are antithetical to the educational climate they want to create.
Some campuses, like Bowdoin and Colby, have eliminated Greek houses entirely, according to Alfred officials. Others, like Dartmouth, are still grappling with systems they would like to change.
"It takes a determined and courageous group of trustees to do this," said Alfred's president, Charles M. Edmondson, "because Greek alums are vocal."
Alfred University is in Alfred, N.Y., a small town near the Pennsylvania border about 75 miles south of Rochester. There, as on many campuses, Greek life was once central to the social life of many students. In the mid-1960's, more than 40 percent of the students belonged to a fraternity or sorority.
But the role of fraternities and sororities at Alfred has dwindled considerably. Today, only about 200 students -- about 10 percent of undergraduates -- belong to Greek societies, and only about half of that number actually live in the houses, which have been poorly maintained and are undersubscribed.
But despite their shrinking presence, the houses were a continuing source of problems, university officials said. In 1992, Alfred assigned an assistant dean of students to oversee the houses. Even that did not help. After Mr. Klein's death, the board initiated its study.
In the spring semester alone, 6 of Alfred's 12 Greek organizations (8 fraternities and 4 sororities) were sanctioned for violating university regulations.
As the task force studied Greek life at Alfred it found a variety of problems. The students in Alfred's Greek houses tended to drink more, and more often, than other Alfred students, and their overall academic standing was both lower than the campus average and lower than their SAT scores and high school grades might have suggested. (There were exceptions, the task force said.)
"The students were voting with their feet by not joining Greek houses as much," said Gene Bernstein, an Alfred graduate and former chairman of the Alfred board, who led the task force. "But of more concern to us on the board was the fact that despite the decline, the violations of the university's policies on alcohol and hazing were continuing and increasing."
Last month, the Allegany County district attorney's office announced that Mr. Klein had been the victim of an assault but that his death was not a homicide and could not be directly attributed to the assault. The office said it anticipated that charges would be brought in connection with the assault when the police completed their investigation.
Although five of the eight members of the task force had participated in Greek organizations themselves at Alfred or elsewhere, they concluded that efforts to reform Alfred's fraternities and sororities had been unsuccessful. Dr. Bernstein, a semiretired business executive with a doctorate in English literature, who formerly taught at Notre Dame, said that by the group's fifth meeting, in late April, a straw vote showed that everyone had reached the same conclusion, that the system had to be closed down.
"Emotionally, it was difficult, because many of us had fond memories of the experiences we had had in Greek houses," Dr. Bernstein said. "But on a factual, intellectual level, it was not hard to reach the conclusion we did."
Not everyone applauds the trustees' decision. Hank Nuwer, the author of "Broken Pledges" (1990, Longstreet Press), a book that examined the death of another Alfred University student in a fraternity hazing incident in 1978, argues that even when a university ends its involvement with Greek houses, the problems do not disappear.
"When you get rid of Greek organizations, they are going to stay there in some other form," Mr. Nuwer said. "They go underground. The problem doesn't go away. It's just that the liability for the university goes away."
Mr. Nuwer said there had been public reports of at least 84 deaths connected with fraternities since January 2000. But he added that he would have preferred to see the university work harder to reform the Greek culture, despite a decade of unsuccessful efforts.
One Alfred fraternity leader who spoke on the condition that he and his fraternity not be named, said that he was disappointed by Alfred's action, but not surprised.
"This is the easiest way for them to get rid of their liability," he said. "But when you ban Greek houses, all you do is push them underground, and they're going to get worse because then there's nobody to watch them."
He said the university should have enforced its policies more strongly and provided more leadership training to Greek officials. "This," he said, "was definitely the wrong path to take."

HEADLINE: TRACES OF TERROR: THE BIOTERROR THREAT; 
Anthrax Scare at Bank; Lie Tests at Army Labs

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21 

 BODY:
Still looking for clues about who sent deadly anthrax through the mail last year, federal investigators plan to give lie detector tests to workers at two Army laboratories that handle anthrax, a spokeswoman for the Federal Bureau of Investigation said today.
 There have been no confirmed anthrax attacks for more than six months, but tests conducted this week detected anthrax in the mail at the World Bank and at the International Monetary Fund here. Officials suspect that these results are false positives, but the mail was sent for further tests. 
 The F.B.I. spokeswoman said the lie detector examinations would be given to workers at laboratories at Fort Detrick in Maryland and the Dugway Proving Ground in Utah. Capt. Amy Hannah, an Army spokeswoman, said soldiers and Army employees were expected to cooperate.
The plans for tests were first reported by ABC News.
Law enforcement officials have said they have no prime suspect in the anthrax crimes. Five people died and more than a dozen others became ill from anthrax spores that apparently leaked from letters.
Experts in microbiology have advanced the theory that the culprit is a scientist, technician or contractor who gained expertise in anthrax from working in a military laboratory.
At the World Bank, Caroline Anstey, the chief spokeswoman, said that all mail is routinely tested and that a preliminary test on Monday came up with a positive result. A more sophisticated test was negative, but as a precaution, the mail was sent to a private testing laboratory, she said. Results are expected on Wednesday or Thursday.
Thousands of workers who have offices that share an air-conditioning system with the mail room were told not to go to their offices until the matter was resolved. They are working elsewhere, Ms. Anstey said.
At the monetary fund, mail that tested negative on Friday was retested on Monday before it was distributed inside headquarters here because the fund is so closely linked in people's minds to the World Bank, Francisco Baker, a spokesman, said. The new tests had a positive finding, and that mail was sent with the World Bank mail for further tests, Mr. Baker said.
The officials said workers were not being advised to take antibiotics.
Early this month, mail at the Federal Reserve Board tested positive for anthrax. Follow-up testing is not complete, but no other evidence of anthrax has been found, David Skidmore, a spokesman, said.

HEADLINE: Nonprofit Sector of City Economy Is Fastest-Growing Source of Jobs, a Study Reports 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
The nonprofit sector is the fastest-growing source of jobs in New York City, according to a new study of the sector's economic role. 
 The study shows that unlike other business sectors, the nonprofit sector has been a steady and growing source of jobs for a decade, a finding confirmed by economists and labor analysts. 
 The study, which is to be released today, found that the 9,078 members of the New York City nonprofit sector reporting to the state and federal governments put more than $43 billion into the city's economy in 2000, accounting for 11.5 percent of economic activity in the city, and employed 528,000 people, or 14 percent of the city's work force.
For the purposes of the study, the nonprofit sector is defined as including schools, hospitals, zoos, museums and the like, but not foundations, religious organizations, unions or other groups that serve only their members. In other surveys of work force strength, hospitals, almost all of which are nonprofit institutions, are lumped together with for-profit businesses and tracked as health services. Private schools and universities are similarly put into a category called educational services. 
While the city's employment as a whole grew only 4 percent in the 1990's, employment in the nonprofit units surveyed increased 25 percent, the study found. The biggest job sector is wholesale and retail sales, followed by government employment, nonprofit groups and the influential finance-insurance-real estate field, the study found. 
"This is a huge economic engine in the city, and better yet, it's stable," said John E. Seley, a professor at City University of New York who compiled the study with Prof. Julian Wolpert of Princeton University. "It can't be easily tempted to relocate to New Jersey with tax incentives, it's not beholden to swings in the stock market, and it is growing much faster than any other sector." 
James P. Brown, a labor market analyst at the State Department of Labor, discussing the increase in jobs, said, "A variety of trends have favored those industries that nonprofits tend to dominate." 
Economic and social trends have increased the demand for private schools and universities. A larger and larger portion of the city's gross domestic product is being spent on health care and social services. The push to move people off the welfare rolls and into jobs has increased demand for job training that is largely provided to the nonprofit sector, which is also a source of many entry-level jobs.
The study, which was financed primarily by the Atlantic Philanthropies, a foundation that often underwrites studies of the nonprofit sector, is an effort to make policy makers and residents more aware of the role the nonprofit sector plays in the city economy. 
Quantifying the expansion of the nonprofit sector is a rare exercise, and some argue that it is not even a sector. "Nonprofits are not an industry," Mr. Brown said. 
The last comparable effort to define the sector came in 1990, but it is difficult to make comparisons between that study and this one. 
The 1990 study placed the sector's contribution to the city economy at $32 billion, but it included a variety of organizations that are left out of the new study, including unions and foundations that are membership organizations or do not provide services directly. 
The report and its findings have caught the eye of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and his officials. His office, knowing that it will fall largely to the nonprofit sector to cope with the effect of the projected $5 billion budget gap, has ordered 30 copies of the study.
Their interest contrasts starkly with that of Giuliani administration, which alienated the nonprofit sector by eliminating its traditional access to city commissioners, giving city contracts to for-profit service providers and being notably slow to make contract payments.
In addition to the 528,000 people working in the nonprofit sector, more than 99,000 people serve on nonprofit boards and 342,000 volunteer their services. 
Roughly 2.2 million people have some contact with the nonprofit sector each day, the study showed, and that does not include the 3 million people who listen to public television or radio or those who pass through religious institutions.
The nonprofit sector is diverse, and includes the Museo del Barrio, Lenox Hill Hospital, the Chinese American Planning Council and Friends and Relatives of the Institutionalized Aged Inc.

Letter Says Labor Deal Was Never Very Close

BYLINE:  By MURRAY CHASS 

 BODY:
As negotiations between baseball club owners and players for a new labor contract remain stalemated, debate continues to boil over the fallout from secret talks the two sides held during a three-month period in the first half of last year.
 Players, fueled by information from their union leaders, have been critical of Commissioner Bud Selig, saying that before he yanked the owners' representatives out of the 2001 talks, the negotiators were close enough that a deal could very likely have been achieved by the All-Star Game last July. Selig has repeatedly and vehemently rejected the idea that a deal was in the works. 
 A letter that Rob Manfred, the owners' chief labor lawyer, wrote to Donald Fehr, the head of the union, last December appears to support Selig's position on the status of those secret talks. 
Manfred wrote the four-page letter, a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times yesterday, to provide details of a proposal Selig gave to Fehr at a meeting in Milwaukee last Dec. 3.
In the letter, dated Dec. 14, Manfred reminded Fehr that throughout their talks last April, May and June he and Paul Beeston, then Major League Baseball's chief operating officer, emphasized the need for the players to address "three key issues": a significant increase in revenue-sharing, a meaningful luxury tax and a worldwide amateur draft.
The players had made a proposal June 20, Manfred recalled, noting that it had been suggested "that the proposal put us close to an agreement." But he disputed that characterization.
"It is, however, both inaccurate and unfair," he wrote, "to suggest that the proposal was a major step forward, let alone one that put the parties close to an agreement." The proposal, Manfred wrote, "addressed only one of the three major issues that we have consistently identified as central to the negotiations. Your proposal, of course, was limited to the topic of revenue-sharing."
Fehr, Manfred reminded him, had said he saw "no need" for a luxury tax of any type. And in its proposal on revenue-sharing, Manfred said, the union proposed a different distribution method from the one "the vast majority of the clubs prefer." Furthermore, he said, the union proposal increased the amount of local revenue shared -- $166 million in 2001 -- by only $15 million to $20 million.
"Given the magnitude of the industry's problems," Manfred wrote, "such a small increase in revenue-sharing, in a format unacceptable to the clubs, left us with few options."
In the letter, Manfred reminded Fehr that he had told him the previous spring that the clubs could proceed with negotiations "directed at an early agreement" only if the union was prepared to deal with the luxury-tax issue.
Further confusing matters, at apparently the same time the players thought an early deal was possible, Beeston was telling Selig and the owners that he believed he could achieve the goals of a blue-ribbon panel report, a management official said.
The panel, appointed by Selig, issued a report on baseball economics in July 2000. Selig based his proposal last December on that report, including an increase in revenue-sharing to 50 percent of the clubs' local revenue and a 50 percent tax on portions of payrolls over $98 million.
Beeston, who left Major League Baseball earlier this year, has declined to talk about the negotiations or his role in them.
In his letter to Fehr, Manfred also reiterated Selig's offer that if a new labor agreement could be promptly negotiated, he would consider recommending to the clubs that their plan to eliminate two teams for the 2002 season be deferred for a year.
Selig subsequently called off the contraction plan for this season in the face of legal challenges to it. The old collective bargaining agreement expired last Nov. 7, the day after the owners voted to eliminate two teams. Negotiations since then have been held sporadically with much of the negotiators' time consumed by the union's challenge to contraction.

HEADLINE: In Much of Connecticut, Go-Go 90's Went Nowhere, Data Show 

BYLINE:  By PAUL ZIELBAUER 

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 21 

 BODY:
Despite the economic boom during most of the decade, Connecticut's median household income fell slightly between 1990 and 2000, according to Census data released today.
 Unlike the rest of New England and most other states, where household income rose in the 1990's, Connecticut's dropped by $213, to $53,935. 
 Median household income is only one measure of economic well-being, and while household income fell in 102 of Connecticut's 169 cities and towns, the state's per-capita figure rose by 9 percent, to $28,766, easily the highest in the nation.
The slight decline in median income combined with the increase in per-capita income illuminates Connecticut's growing income disparity between its poorest and wealthiest residents and, by extension, its withering cities and blooming suburbs, economic analysts said. 
"If you have per-capita income going up and median income going down and poverty going up, it sort of necessarily means that the rich are getting richer, the bottom half aren't doing that well," said Andrew A. Beveridge, a sociology professor at Queens College who did the income analyses, adjusted for inflation, for The New York Times.
"It certainly says that there is a bigger disparity between the suburbs and cities," he said. "Wealthy places are getting more wealthy."
The figures showed that income fell in the state's largest cities, Bridgeport, New Haven, Hartford, Stamford and Waterbury, while individual and family poverty rates increased.
In Hartford, for instance, one of the nation's poorest cities, median household income dropped 15.8 percent, to $24,820 while poverty grew steadily, afflicting nearly one in three city residents. In New Haven, median household income fell 13 percent, to $29,604, while the poverty rate increased, affecting one in four residents.
Although the decrease seemed small, Connecticut's $213 decline in median income during a decade in which many states saw the figure go up left some economists and demographers surprised or skeptical.
"Wow," said Steven Lanza, executive editor of the Connecticut Economy, a quarterly produced at the University of Connecticut. "That's a stunning number. It really shows the extent to which the economy of Connecticut got hammered by the great recession of the early 1990's, where the state lost the heart of its manufacturing sector."
Indeed, the most severe income declines occurred in Hartford County, where the state's once-mighty insurance and financial services industry were decimated by layoffs, declines in the real estate market and corporate mergers by out-of-state companies.
Hartford County, in fact, was the only county where household and family income fell during the 1990's, the Census data shows. Per-capita income also grew the least, by 5.7 percent, compared to 13 percent in prosperous Fairfield County, where the stock market's historic run in the 1990's kept incomes among the highest in the nation.
Median family income also rose in Fairfield County, by 2.6 percent, to $65,521, the data show.
But even in wealthy regions like Fairfield County, median household income rose by only $500 in the 1990's, to $65,249.
"This is the richest state in the country," said Stan McMillan, manager of the University of Connecticut's Center for Economic Analysis. "We had the largest run-up in the stock market in United States history and yet we're looking at increases in median household income of only 1 or 2 percent?"
But Fred Carstensen, the director of the center, said the drop was to be expected, perhaps.
"When you're as rich as Connecticut is, it's hard to maintain the growth," said Mr. Carstensen, who is also a University of Connecticut economics professor. "On a lot of indicators, you're going to fall back."
Gov. John G. Rowland, through a spokesman, said today that the growing income disparity was no surprise. "With the stock market performance over the last several years, it's not surprising that the wealthy would have gotten wealthier," said Chris Cooper, Mr. Rowland's press secretary.
Over all, Fairfield County grew -- by income level, population and number and type of immigrants -- by considerable margins.
Towns like Darien, Wilton and Easton each recorded median household income gains of 20 percent or more (beating famously wealthy Greenwich by about 4 percent).
The county's 7 percent population growth, to 882,567 people, was fueled by a large influx of Asian and Hispanic immigrants.
Nearly one of four county residents speak a language other than English, up from one of five.

HEADLINE: World Business Briefing Americas: Argentina: Reserves Tapped For Debt 

BYLINE:  By Larry Rohter (NYT) 

 BODY:
 With a deadline today to make the first installment on repayment of a $2.5 billion loan from the World Bank, the Ministry of the Economy has elected to dip into Argentina's foreign reserves. 
The reserves, which have fallen nearly 20 percent this year, to about $11.7 billion, are currently at their lowest level in more than seven years. The government made the decision to use almost $800 million in reserves, rather than default on the loan and be denied further credits, only after the United States and the International Monetary Fund strongly urged President Eduardo Duhalde to abandon an earlier plan to ask neighboring countries for a bridge loan to make the payment.

HEADLINE: China Called Close to Deal To Import Natural Gas 

BYLINE:  By KEITH BRADSHER 

DATELINE: HONG KONG, May 21 

 BODY:
The Chinese government is close to concluding its first big contract to import liquefied natural gas, in a deal worth at least $9 billion that will not only help turn the Chinese energy industry into a global player but will also have strategic and commercial implications for all of East Asia.
 Three big consortiums, each including one of the giant international energy companies, have emerged as finalists, offering to ship natural gas from Indonesia, Australia or the Persian Gulf nation of Qatar. The winner may gain a long-term advantage in what is expected to be one of the world's largest markets for natural gas, several people involved in the negotiations said. 
 Chinese officials have said a final decision could come this month. But as it has sometimes done in the past, China may instead winnow the three finalists to two this month and then conduct another round of bidding, in the hope of extracting even better terms. 
The winning consortium and country will be locked in a large-scale commercial embrace with China for a long time. The initial contract being let by the Chinese is for roughly $450 million worth of liquefied natural gas to be delivered each year to Shenzhen, a city adjacent to Hong Kong, for 20 to 25 years.
At 3.2 million tons a year, the contract would account for nearly 3 percent of all internationally traded liquefied natural gas. China is trying to wean itself off high-pollution coal in favor of cleaner-burning gas, and its officials have said they may pursue two more contracts for another four million tons a year.
China is demanding that its offshore drilling and production company, CNOOC Ltd., be granted an equity stake in whatever gas field becomes the winning supplier for the current contract. Together with the recent purchase of Indonesian oil fields for $591 million from Repsol-YPF of Spain, the natural gas deal is part of the Chinese company's transformation into a truly international energy company with broad ambitions across Asia.
CNOOC Ltd. is 70.6 percent owned by the Chinese government; the remaining 29.4 percent of its stock trades publicly in New York and Hong Kong. Merrill Lynch is advising the company on this gas deal.
While the United States has been active in trying to influence where Central Asian oil pipelines are built, hoping to route them through friendly countries and away from Iran, Washington has been silent on the bidding for the Chinese gas project. All three finalist nations are American allies.
The bidding has attracted particular public attention in Australia, where Prime Minister John Howard is trying to build closer political, strategic and commercial ties with China. Mr. Howard flew to Beijing today, and will personally present to Chinese leaders on Wednesday his case for why China should choose a group of companies, including Royal Dutch/Shell and BHP Billiton, that are now extracting gas from Australia's North West Shelf.
"I take the view that it's my responsibility, my job, to give it the best shot I can and to argue very strongly," Mr. Howard told reporters during a stopover in Singapore today on his way to Beijing.
But Mr. Howard noted that Australia faced a "very difficult" challenge to win the contract. Liquefied natural gas is fairly expensive to transport overseas, because it must be kept very cold and under extreme pressure in special ships. The closest gas field being offered to the Chinese government is in Indonesia; the Australian field is next, and Qatar, which is in a partnership with Exxon Mobil, is the farthest away.
BP and the Indonesian government are offering China gas from a new offshore field, mostly owned by BP, in a bay off Irian Jaya, the Indonesian half of the island of New Guinea. Oil companies traditionally have offered slightly lower prices to sign up the first customer for a new gas field, because of the risk of problems and delays.
In addition to being closest to China, BP's bid may have an advantage because the company is already in a consortium with CNOOC to build the terminal in the Shenzhen area that will receive and distribute the gas. Its disadvantage is Indonesia's record of political instability: Exxon Mobil has had trouble keeping open its liquefied natural gas operation on Sumatra, at the western end of Indonesia, because of fighting with a separatist movement there, and Irian Jaya, at the eastern end of Indonesia, also has a separatist movement. 
Analysts say it is hard to predict how the Chinese government will balance the many issues involved in the gas contract decision. "The important things from a Chinese perspective are the pricing and security of supply, the potential for expansion of the contract at competitive prices and the ability to participate in the equity of the project," said Tom Hilboldt, the director of Asian oil and gas research at Salomon Smith Barney.
The contract is meant to address a conundrum facing Chinese economic planners: How to supply enormous quantities of energy for the vast network of factories that has sprung up in Guangdong Province, up the Pearl River from Hong Kong. The province has virtually no oil, gas or coal deposits of its own; it now buys huge amounts of coal from the rest of China and oil from abroad, playing a big role in China's $10 billion annual bill for oil imports. China is building a gas pipeline across the width of the country from near its western border to Shanghai, but it will not carry enough gas to supply southern China's expected needs as well.
Coal burning has badly fouled the air in Guangdong and Hong Kong, to official embarrassment. At the same time, railroads and other resources are tied up with the increasingly difficult job of moving mountains of coal to Guangdong. "The transportation and storage capacity for coal compete with industrial capacity that could be used to bring in foreign currency," said Mark Qiu, CNOOC's chief financial officer.
Environmentalists have applauded China for trying to switch to natural gas, which contributes much less to global warming than the burning of coal.

HEADLINE: House Votes $1.3 Billion in Aid for Afghanistan 

BYLINE:  By ROBERT PEAR 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21 

 BODY:
The House of Representatives voted tonight to provide $1.3 billion in economic and military aid to Afghanistan after demanding that President Bush devise a strategy to establish law and order there.
 Lawmakers of both parties said they feared that the United States's military success could be undermined if lawlessness persisted in Afghanistan. 
 The bill, to rebuild Afghanistan and combat the production of narcotics, was passed by a vote of 390 to 22. 
The money, to be made available over four years, would be used to create jobs, clear land mines, pay for education and health care, vaccinate children and revive the nation's agriculture.
"This recovery effort must be sustained in the months and years ahead," said the chief sponsor of the bill, Representative Henry J. Hyde, the Illinois Republican who is chairman of the Committee on International Relations. But, he emphasized, "the administration needs a coherent strategy." 
The House approved an amendment offered by Representative Tom Lantos, Democrat of California, that calls on the president to devise "a strategy for meeting the immediate and long-term security needs of Afghanistan." The president would have 45 days to send such a plan to Congress.
"Afghanistan is in grave danger of relapsing into the very conditions of violence and warlordism that created the Taliban and attracted Al Qaeda to operate there," Mr. Lantos said. "Outside Kabul, Afghanistan continues to be a land where every thug with a rifle can set up an illegal checkpoint to extort money from travelers while the unarmed and outnumbered police cower in their makeshift headquarters."
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Delaware Democrat who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, supports major goals of the House bill and has hinted that he might seek more money for security assistance.
"If current trends continue in Afghanistan," Mr. Biden said on Friday, "we may soon find that our hard-won success on the battlefield has melted away with the winter snow.."
The House bill emphasizes the need to provide assistance to women and girls, disarm and demobilize Afghan warriors, and help establish the rule of lawy.
In addition, American aid would be used to suppress the cultivation of opium poppies and substitute other crops; build health clinics; coordinate efforts to treat diseases; foster the development of independent news media; promote and monitor human rights; and recruit and train teachers.
Under the bill, the United States would spend $10 million a year from 2002 to 2005 to help conduct local, regional and national elections, to foster development of political parties and to carry out a traditional Afghan assembly, or loya jirga.

Is lending money to Buffett a privilege worth paying for?

BYLINE:  By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
WARREN E. BUFFETT wants to borrow up to $287.5 million, and he thinks he should pay a negative interest rate on the money. That is, he thinks the lenders should pay him money.
 And what do the lenders get in return, aside from negative cash flow? They receive the right to buy shares in Berkshire Hathaway at a premium over the current market price. That right will be good for five years, by which time, the lenders will hope, Berkshire stock will have risen enough to make the investment a good one. 
 The offering is a private placement that was unveiled to institutional investors yesterday afternoon by Goldman, Sachs, which designed the structure. In its announcement, Berkshire Hathaway said it was "the first-ever negative-coupon security." It is being offered in a private placement only to institutional buyers. The exact pricing is expected to be disclosed today. 
Under the proposal made to investors, Berkshire would pay perhaps 3 percent a year on the bonds it is issuing. But the investor would also receive a warrant allowing the purchase of Berkshire stock.
To keep the warrant alive, investors would have to pay a higher rate, perhaps 3.75 percent, at the same time Berkshire made the interest payments. The net effect would be that Berkshire would receive a negative interest rate.
The warrant is expected to be priced at about a 12.5 percent premium over Berkshire's current stock price. The deal was disclosed after the market closed yesterday, with Berkshire shares up $300, to $77,900, in New York Stock Exchange trading.
The bonds would have a five-year life, but the holder would have the right to sell them back to Berkshire for face value on each annual anniversary of the offering. That would be expected to happen if Berkshire stock were to fall sharply. If it did, Berkshire would have borrowed money at a negative rate for the intervening period.
On the other hand, if the warrants are eventually exercised, Berkshire will have sold stock at a premium over the current market price.
Berkshire said the new securities are called Squarz (pronounced squares) but did not say just what those letters stood for. Investment banks love to copyright such names because they cannot protect financial structures from imitators if they prove to be popular.
Berkshire said it planned to borrow $250 million under the deal, with an additional $37.5 million available to cover overallotments if the deal sells well.
While a negative interest rate breaks new ground, Berkshire is far from the first company to take advantage of the combination of low market interest rates and the extraordinary volatility of the stock market. That volatility increases the value of an option to buy a stock, and that added value can offset the interest that a company would otherwise pay to borrow.
A number of companies have borrowed money at zero percent while offering warrants to buy their stock at a 30 percent premium or more over the price that is current when the bonds are issued. Berkshire is offering a lower conversion premium, which is good for the buyer, while demanding in return an effective negative interest rate.
It is able to do that because it requires periodic payments for the warrant, whereas warrants are usually sold as part of the original deal and require no additional payments.

No Mosh Pit, This, but Some Enthusiasm for Aid

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: ACCRA, Ghana, May 21 

 BODY:
To Bono, the rock star who has made alleviating African poverty his cause, Ghana is "the birthplace of cool," a country so vibrant with its own metaphorical jazz that the right dose of aid and investment could secure it a place in the global economy. 
 To Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill, Ghana's prospects are equally upbeat. But he is less focused on the rhythms of the country and more intent on having enforceable contracts and strict proof that aid is used effectively. 
 This is Stop 1 on the O'Neill-Bono Africa Tour 2002, nearly two weeks of fact-finding travel across the world's most ravaged continent by the well-starched former corporate chief executive who signs the dollar bill and the earring-laden, Grammy-collecting lead singer of U2. 
It is undoubtedly one of the strangest delegations ever to descend on Africa. ("I am definitely not Felix," Bono said en route here, referring to the more fastidious member of the Odd Couple.)
But it is also one that illustrates an expanding ideological consensus on the need to address poverty, disease, famine and conflict in Africa -- as well as the remaining gulf between left and right about how best to do it.
From Bono's perspective, the tour, which goes on to South Africa, Uganda and Ethiopia, is an opportunity to convince the Bush administration that aid to Africa is both a moral imperative and a good investment of taxpayer money. "Development assistance can be effective, and I want to show him it can be effective," he said. 
Mr. O'Neill said that the United States is committed to helping and that he has an open mind about how to do so. But he made clear that the United States would be skeptical about providing aid to countries that cannot show how they are improving standards of living. 
"The results of official development assistance have been disappointing, and many poor countries here have stayed that way, even as others have excelled," Mr. O'Neill said in a speech here today. "We have to be hardheaded and demand results: That is our responsibility to the impoverished people of Africa."
Even as Bono brings new public attention to debt relief and AIDS in Africa, many development economists and African leaders are stressing that only increased trade can bring permanent advancement. 
Bono and his advisers said they are all for expanded trade. But the singer is clearly struggling with how far to go in endorsing free-market solutions to Africa's problems. 
After a visit today to a company here that processes medical and dental claims for American insurers via a satellite link, Bono, unprompted, brought up the question of whether the company's 800 employees are being exploited. They are paid up to $1 an hour, four times the average wage here but far less than they would get for the same work in the United States. 
"As long as these employees and the government are exploiting the corporate world in a symbiotic relationship, that's fine," he said. Pressed by reporters, he added, "I haven't made up my mind on some of these issues." 
But he said the sight of Africans working at rows of gleaming computers was valuable just for shattering preconceived notions of the continent's limitations. 
Mr. O'Neill stepped forward. "It's not a difficult question," the secretary said, "whether you want to have people paid $1 a day or $1 an hour."
Bono and Mr. O'Neill may have some differing views. But the fact that Bono, whose real name is Paul David Hewson, has equal billing with the Bush administration's senior economic policy official on a diplomatic mission is evidence of the remarkable influence he has on the issue in Washington. 
He has become almost a regular on Capitol Hill, where he worked quietly for several years to convince conservative Republicans of the benefits of writing off some of the debts owed by poor nations to wealthy nations. 
He is now lending his support to efforts in Congress to appropriate more money to combat AIDS around the world. Earlier this year he played a key role in persuading President Bush to provide an additional $5 billion a year in aid to poor countries that could show they could get results.
"My job is to bring some applause if a politician is bold enough to make these new steps," Bono told Ghana's president, John A. Kufuor, at a meeting with Mr. O'Neill today.
But by all accounts, Bono has done more than just shine a celebrity spotlight on an oft-ignored part of the world. 
Both Democrats and Republicans who have dealt with him say he has been a shrewd operator, especially in building support among conservatives for debt relief and foreign aid. Bono has been able to package such aid, when properly accounted for, as a moral undertaking that should be a natural goal of religious conservatives.
Indeed, Bono counts Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican, among his biggest fans (at least when it comes to development policy). He has close ties to other prominent Republicans, including Senator William Frist of Tennessee, with whom he traveled in Africa earlier this year.
"This guy is for real," said Representative Sonny Callahan, Republican of Alabama, who worked with the singer on relieving some of the debts owed by African governments to the United States and has proposed that the two of them form a new group called Sonny and Bono.
"He did bridge the gap between me and the more liberal community who were just calling for debt relief alone," Mr. Callahan said.
Some Republicans acknowledge privately that working with Bono is attractive to them because he gives them credibility with younger, more liberal voters, who are not their natural constituents. Bono said he is well aware of the possibility of being used for political purposes. But he said he does not care as long as he makes progress in pushing policies he supports.
"I'm not a cheap date," Bono told White House officials earlier this year.

HEADLINE: Under Cheney, Halliburton Altered Policy On Accounting 

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON and LOWELL BERGMAN 

 BODY:
During Vice President Dick Cheney's tenure as its chief executive, the Halliburton Corporation altered its accounting policies so it could report as revenue more than $100 million in disputed costs on big construction projects, public filings by the company show. Halliburton did not disclose the change to investors for over a year.
 At the time of the change -- which was approved by Arthur Andersen, the company's auditor at the time -- Halliburton was suffering big losses on some of its long-term contracts, according to the filings. Its stock had slumped because of a recession in the oil industry. Two former executives of Dresser Industries, which merged with Halliburton in 1998, said that they concluded after the merger that Halliburton had instituted aggressive accounting practices to obscure its losses. 
 Much of Halliburton's business comes from big construction projects, like natural gas processing plants, which sometimes run over budget. With the policy change, Halliburton began to book revenue on the assumption that its customers would pay at least part of the cost overruns, although they remained in dispute. Before 1998, the company had been more conservative, reporting revenue from overruns only after settling with its customers. 
As chief executive, Mr. Cheney had final responsibility for Halliburton's books. But the company's chief financial officer, Doug Foshee, said yesterday that he could not imagine that Mr. Cheney had specifically approved the change, which he called a routine decision dictated by a shift in Halliburton's business mix. 
Mr. Cheney declined to comment yesterday. Andersen, which was fired as Halliburton's auditor last month, referred all questions to the company.
Mr. Foshee said he was certain that the accounting change was approved by David Lesar, a former Andersen accountant who was Mr. Cheney's second-in-command and succeeded him as chief executive in 2000. Halliburton, which continues to follow the more aggressive policy, declined to make Mr. Lesar available for comment.
Accounting specialists said that the change stretched and may have broken accounting rules. 
"If they changed their accounting from recording claims when they were settled and collected to recording claims at an earlier point in time, then that would raise a red flag and would raise a question as to whether it's a permissible change," said Lynn Turner, a professor of accounting at Colorado State University and former chief accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
A company that revises an accounting practice usually must show that its new method gives investors more accurate financial information than its old method. Halliburton's revision, Mr. Turner said, does not seem to meet that standard. In addition, such changes are supposed to be disclosed promptly, he said.
The criticism of Halliburton comes amid heightened suspicion on Wall Street about corporate accounting. Andersen is now on trial in Houston for destroying records related to its audits of Enron, and regulators and lawmakers in Washington are debating whether to tighten accounting oversight. 
Though the 1998 accounting change involved a relatively small sum for a company that had $17 billion in sales that year, it came at an important moment for Halliburton. 
The Dallas-based company was eager to win back investors' confidence after its takeover of Dresser, another energy services company. Mr. Cheney has called that deal, which was completed in September 1998, a top achievement of his time at Halliburton, though some experts say that the asbestos-related liabilities Dresser brought to the company may end up driving Halliburton into bankruptcy. 
On Jan. 20, 1999, Halliburton reported sales of $4.3 billion and profit of $66 million for the fourth quarter of 1998, both down from the period a year earlier. Mr. Cheney acknowledged that the quarter had been difficult but said he was "optimistic about the long-term outlook for our industry and for Halliburton in particular."
The change in policy enabled the company to book $89 million in unsettled claims as revenue in 1998, compared to a "de minimis" figure in previous years, Mr. Foshee said.
Exactly how much of that revenue turned into profits for the company is not stated in Halliburton's financial reports. But the impact would have been significant had the company taken the alternative route of writing the cost overruns off as losses, wiping out more than half of its $175 million in pretax operating profits for the fourth quarter, when the accounting change took effect.
One year later, revenue from uncollected claims was about $98 million, according to Halliburton's 1999 annual report to the S.E.C. That report, which the company filed in March 2000, included Halliburton's first public disclosure of the new policy.
Mr. Foshee said the company had not disclosed the change in 1998 because it involved such a tiny fraction of total sales. A year later, Halliburton decided to be especially conservative and disclose the new policy, he said. 
Total claims revenue rose to $106 million by July 2000, when Mr. Cheney left the company, and peaked at $234 million at the end of last year.
According to Mr. Foshee, the change in accounting practices reflected changes in the company's business. 
Before the late 1990's, Halliburton had generally worked under "cost plus" contracts, which guaranteed the company a small profit on top of its costs, whatever they were. But by 1998, he said, most of Halliburton's contracts were fixed price, requiring it to finish jobs for a set fee -- or else try to negotiate payment of cost overruns and change orders.
Though resolving such disputes can take months or years, the company decided it was reasonable to recognize at least part of the revenue from the claims even while they remained in dispute, Mr. Foshee said.
"I don't think that's a change in accounting policy as much as it's a change in business mix," he said. He added that Halliburton eventually collected on many of its claims and that its accounting practices reflected that experience.
"We file a claim, and I think we're pretty conservative -- we're fairly conservative -- about reporting the claim," he said.
That explanation was disputed by the former Dresser executives who joined Halliburton after the merger. They said that most of Halliburton's contracts had been fixed price even before 1998 and that the company made the accounting change to obscure large losses on several important construction contracts. 
Halliburton declined to disclose what percentage of its contracts were fixed price in any given year.
Accounting experts said that Halliburton's practices were aggressive. The change was "clearly a way of pumping up revenues and receivables," said Paul Brown, chairman of the accounting department at the Stern School of Business at New York University.
In general, companies are not supposed to book sales unless they are certain that they will be paid -- and how much they will be paid, Mr. Brown said. He asked how Halliburton could know it would be paid on a claim that a customer had the right to dispute.
"There's already a conflict here, or there wouldn't be these claims," Mr. Brown said. "How did Halliburton estimate the possibility that the change order was going to be resolved?"
Indeed, in its 1999 annual report, Halliburton warned investors that "the environment for claims and change orders has become more difficult in the past few years," contributing to increased losses.
Beyond the change in how Halliburton handled disputed claims, the company's books include one other indicator that analysts say can signal aggressive accounting. 
According to S.E.C. filings, Halliburton's accounts receivable -- sales booked by the company even though it had not yet been paid for them -- soared relative to its total sales during Mr. Cheney's tenure. At the same time, its competitors' accounts receivable fell slightly, S.E.C. filings show.
When Mr. Cheney became Halliburton's chief executive in October 1995, Halliburton had roughly 95 cents in receivables for every dollar in quarterly revenues. When he left in July 2000, the ratio was $1.20 in receivables for each dollar in quarterly sales. 
Over the same period, the average ratio of receivables to sales at five big competitors of Halliburton fell slightly, from 92 cents per dollar of sales in 1995 to 86 cents per dollar 5 years later.
The rising receivables are "a little bit of a red flag," said Edward Ketz, an accounting professor at Pennsylvania State University.
Halliburton's stock has plunged since the company merged with Dresser, mainly because the deal saddled Halliburton with huge legal liabilities from a Dresser subsidiary that manufactured asbestos-containing bricks.
Halliburton shares closed yesterday at $17.43, just below their level on Oct. 1, 1995; they stood at more than double that level when Mr. Cheney left the company. Since October 1995, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has risen 86 percent.

HEADLINE: With a Step Right, Senator Clinton Agitates the Left 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 21 

 BODY:
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is drawing fire from her traditional liberal allies as a result of the position she has staked out in the debate over revamping the nation's welfare laws.
 Scores of protesters displayed their anger outside her house here in the Embassy Row neighborhood today, unhappy with her decision to back President Bush's drive to enact new work requirements that they say will ultimately harm welfare recipients. 
 "Senator Clinton needs to understand that the stakes in this debate are very high and that she will be held accountable for her actions," said Deepak Bhargava, the executive director of the National Campaign for Jobs and Income Support, a coalition of advocacy groups representing low-income communities. 
Mrs. Clinton, the New York Democrat, has joined a group of moderate and conservative Democratic senators in supporting a bill to increase the work requirement for welfare recipients to 37 hours a week, a significant increase over the current 30 hours. Mr. Bush would require 40 hours. 
In an interview this afternoon, Mrs. Clinton acknowledged that she had initially been reluctant to back the new work requirements. But she said she decided to support them after the bill's two main Senate sponsors, Evan Bayh of Indiana and Thomas R. Carper of Delaware, agreed to tie them to $8 billion in child care funding.
Mrs. Clinton and her aides also noted that she had secured more money for Medicaid, immigrants' benefits, and education and training for welfare recipients. In addition, Mrs. Clinton noted that the Senate bill maintained limited exemptions from work requirements for mothers of children under 6.
A longer workweek, her critics argue, would force states to abandon existing job-training and placement programs in favor of unpaid workfare assignments for legions of welfare recipients.
The advocates argue that in places like New York City, workfare has not helped substantial numbers of people move from government dependency into permanent jobs. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg last week proposed shifting some of the city's welfare policies toward providing more job training for those leaving the welfare rolls. 
Mr. Bhargava and other advocates for the poor say that perhaps the most troubling implication of Mrs. Clinton's position is the message it sends to other Democrats. "It's a pretty stunning development, and it's had an outsized impact on the debate nationally because of who she is," he said. "She is perceived as a progressive Democrat, and so she is giving cover to other Democrats to do the wrong thing."
The other Democratic senators supporting the bill include John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, Zell Miller of Georgia and John B. Breaux of Louisiana. 
Mrs. Clinton pointed out that the Senate bill was far better than one that the Republican-led House had advanced at Mr. Bush's urging. The House bill imposes a work requirement of 40 hours a week, and does not provide nearly as much money for child care. "It's a vast improvement," she said. "It's not even comparable."
The situation Mrs. Clinton faces is reminiscent of the balancing act that her husband, Bill Clinton, struggled with in 1996, when the left wing pleaded with him to preserve the nation's welfare program while the right urged him to dismantle it.
In the end, President Clinton upset his traditional liberal supporters by backing a measure that overhauled the program by, among other things, ending the federal guarantee of cash assistance for the poor.
Now, Mrs. Clinton finds herself in the cross hairs of an array of advocacy groups for the poor, including Families United for Racial and Economic Equality and Community Voices Heard, both based in New York. 
"This is the first time that Hillary Clinton has been attacked by the left," said Eric Hauser, an advocate for the poor here. "She has been a heroine to the progressive left for her entire career. Now, the progressive left is enraged, and rightly so."
Politically, Mrs. Clinton's position has puzzled some advocates for the poor, who note that she represents a largely Democratic state where there would be little fallout if she took a stand against the tighter restrictions.
"New York is not Arkansas," Mr. Bhargava said. "You just can't get away with this in New York. People feel too strongly about this and are too well organized to let you off the hook."
Some critics also expressed doubt that Democrats would be able to get all the money they want in negotiations with House Republicans. And Bertha Lewis, the executive director of New York Acorn, an advocacy group for the poor, noted that even Orrin G. Hatch, the conservative Republican senator from Utah, had supported a bipartisan measure that would keep the work requirement at its current level of 30 hours a week. 
"When you are right of Orrin Hatch, what is that about?" she said. "That's not good. She is right of Orrin Hatch. That's where our consternation comes in."

HEADLINE: In New Focus on Quality of Life, City Goes After Petty Criminals 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM 

 BODY:
New York City's prosecutors, police and probation officials said yesterday that they would begin cracking down on a core group of as many as 9,700 people who repeatedly commit petty crimes like prostitution, public drinking and drug use, but serve little jail time.
 The plan, Operation Spotlight, is Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's latest twist on an idea popularized by his predecessor, Rudolph W. Giuliani: that the best way to keep overall crime down is to focus on small offenses that damage the quality of life, while relying on a huge, aggressive police presence on the streets. 
 But the new administration's approach, shaped in a time of tighter budgets and a smaller police force, is at once more focused on certain offenders and also broader in the number of agencies involved and the potential impact. Mr. Bloomberg, noting that reported crime continues to decline in almost all major categories, said yesterday he wanted to use not only the police, but also prosecutors, the courts and probation officials to focus on petty criminals. 
"From beginning to end," Mr. Bloomberg said, "from the police officer who arrests a persistent offender, to the prosecutor who asks for bail, to the judge who imposes sentence, to the probation officer who monitors his or her release, everyone is going to be focusing on the career misdemeanor offenders." 
Mr. Bloomberg announced his plan at City Hall with Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly; three of the five district attorneys and senior aides to the others; the chief administrative judge, Jonathan Lippman; the probation commissioner, Martin Horn; and the criminal justice coordinator, John Feinblatt, one architect of the plan, which begins July 1.
The 9,700 figure cited yesterday was based on a statistical model developed by Mr. Feinblatt's office, officials said, and does not reflect a list of suspects whom the police intend to round up. Rather, under the program, when someone is arrested and identified as a repeat misdemeanor offender the police will speed processing of the evidence, and the defendant will be arraigned in a special part of Criminal Court in each borough, where the case will receive priority treatment, the mayor said. Prosecutors will highlight the case and recommend strong sentences, he said.
While judges have discretion over sentencing, an aide to Mr. Bloomberg said he expected they would mete out harsher punishments to some of the repeat offenders. Some defendants could get as much as a year in jail -- the maximum for some misdemeanors -- or agree to court-ordered drug treatment under such a threat.
Chronic offenders on probation will be more closely monitored, ensuring for example that they complete drug treatment, Mr. Bloomberg said. Probation violators will more quickly face revocation hearings, he said. 
This differs from the Giuliani administration's strategy, which churned tens of thousands of petty offenders through the criminal justice system. While they were checked for warrants and some were questioned about other crimes, most were released after 24 hours or sentenced to community service. Critics complained the courts were overwhelmed. Bloomberg officials said they did not expect Operation Spotlight to tax the courts or Rikers Island, where these offenders would serve jail time.
Underlying the new program is the statistical analysis by Mr. Feinblatt's office showing nearly 28 percent of all nonfelony crimes prosecuted in the city -- misdemeanors and violations -- were committed by 6 percent of the defendants. That same analysis found that roughly 9,700 defendants were arrested at least three times last year.
"These are the people who deal drugs, deface storefronts, and steal from our retail establishments," Mr. Bloomberg said. "They drive away tourists, they discourage shoppers, they devalue our neighborhoods, they hurt our economy."
This is the third and broadest effort by Mr. Bloomberg and Commissioner Kelly to build on the zero tolerance strategies of Mr. Giuliani. While the plan recognizes that the Police Department is operating with thousands fewer officers and scant resources, Mr. Feinblatt said it was based on "good criminal justice policy" rather than budget concerns.
The strategy of focusing on low-level offenses was also a foundation of Mr. Giuliani's crime-fighting successes. Known as the "broken windows" theory, it says that if smaller annoyances -- like broken windows -- are left unfixed, they will breed larger crime.
Defense lawyers and civil libertarians had mixed reactions. Susan Hendricks, a senior lawyer for the Legal Aid Society, which represents poor defendants, said past punitive approaches failed. 
"If this approach is focused more on treatment and the city is going to commit the resources to ensure there are enough treatment slots, then that would be something new and it could work," she said. "We're not in favor of crime either, and something that is effective at breaking the cycle of recidivism, something that's effective, is something we'd support."
Christopher Dunn, of the New York Civil Liberties Union, said, "The immediate concern that we have is the role of the courts in this proposal and whether or not defendants will get a fair trial in this special court proceeding." 
And one veteran jurist in Criminal Court said solutions to the seemingly endless parade of repeat petty offenders lay elsewhere, with remedies to the root problems of drugs, homelessness and other urban ills. "Not all these problems can be solved in court," the judge said.

HEADLINE: TELEVISION REVIEW; 
The War Is Long Over, But Vietnam Continues

BYLINE:  By JULIE SALAMON 

 BODY:
It's an old journalist's trick, especially among foreign correspondents, to find revelation in the wisdom of cabdrivers. David Lamb, of The Los Angeles Times, had one of those perception-altering taxi rides on his most recent tour in Vietnam, 25 years after he'd covered the war there as a young reporter.
 Upon discovering that his driver had fought for the North Vietnamese, Mr. Lamb asked whether the cabby hated him because he was an American. The driver pulled over and said: "We fought the Chinese for 1,000 years, we fought the French for 100. You were here just for 10. You were just a blip in the history of a proud nation." 
 In "Vietnam Passage: Journeys from War to Peace," a one-hour documentary on most PBS stations tonight (and on WNET in New York on Sunday night at 10:30), Mr. Lamb presents the postwar experiences of six Vietnamese, who refer to that blip as "the American war." This surprising and affecting film, timed to coincide with Mr. Lamb's latest book, "Vietnam Now: A Reporter Returns" (PublicAffairs), is a vivid reminder that Vietnam didn't end 25 years ago. The war did.
 But for Mr. Lamb, and probably for most people in the United States, Vietnam fell off the radar screen when it disappeared from the nightly news. The value of this documentary lies not only in the informative and moving stories it tells, but for the pictures it shows. Mr. Lamb and the filmmaker, Sandy Northrop (who is also his wife), recall the past not through images that have become well known to Americans but through unfamiliar and revealing archival film and photographs. These focus on the Vietnamese experience of the war and its aftermath, including the country as it appears today, looking remarkably capitalistic but still exotic.
The stories include wartime tragedy and triumph but also the less dramatic process of rebuilding families and lives in altered circumstances. The subjects include a family separated by the war, a Vietnamese man who emigrated to the United States and has raised his family here, and how people adapted (or didn't) to the new regime after the North Vietnamese took control.
One woman, jailed in South Vietnam for six years for supporting the Ho Chi Minh government in the north during the war, now fights the new system as it has moved toward a market economy. "This struggle is even harder than the struggle for liberation," she says. "During war it's easy to distinguish your enemy. Now your enemy is bureaucratic."
Mr. Lamb and Ms. Northrop have created an elegant and textured piece of work that combines richly detailed human stories within a smart framework of politics and history. They deal with the harsh, punitive reality of re-education camps, to which 400,000 South Vietnamese were exiled within their own country. 
But they also sympathetically convey the story of Nguyen Thanh Trung, an American-trained pilot who collaborated with the North Vietnamese. He bombed the Presidential Palace in Saigon in revenge for the death of his father, who had been killed by his fellow villagers when they found out he was a Vietcong soldier. (This story is accompanied by brutal photographs of a body, apparently the father's, being dragged around the village and thrown into the river.)
The documentary resonates with the way the past infiltrates the present, even for people like those portrayed here, who appear to have healthily accommodated vast changes. Binh Nguyen, the man who became a United States citizen, finally returned home as an executive for Federal Express, after trade resumed with Vietnam. Though his children were American born and completely American in outlook, he has always felt a yearning for his childhood home.
In Vietnam he meets an old friend, now chairman of a people's committee, something akin to a town council. The two men are wearing almost identical clothing, dark pants and dress shirts. They look like American businessmen who have taken off their ties, except that they hold hands un-self-consciously.
The camera accompanies the expatriate to the stall in a market where his mother used to sell betel nut, which he describes as the equivalent of chewing tobacco. "How do you explain to an American that my mother used to sell betel nut?" he asks. "How do you tell an American friend about a war that you lived through and he only saw on television?"

FRONTLINE/WORLD
On most PBS stations tonight (check local listings)
More on altered perceptions: Tonight PBS also presents a new magazine program called "Frontline/World," focusing on rarely examined countries and cultures. The premiere episode makes it clear that the unhinged feeling Americans have experienced since Sept. 11 is chronic pain in many parts of the world. 
A strong report from Sri Lanka, "Living With Terror," examines life in a country that leads the world in suicide bombings. Another segment focuses on Sierra Leone, where gunrunners from Ukraine -- and indifference in the United States and elsewhere -- have contributed to horrific massacres. The program also includes a nicely filmed but unsurprising report on the effects of television on Bhutan, the last country in the world to get cable. Cartoon Network in, indigenous culture out.

HEADLINE: Japan Intervenes to Stem Yen Rally 

BYLINE:  By KEN BELSON

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 22 

 BODY:
Worried that the recent rise in the yen's value could snuff out the country's fragile economic recovery, Japan intervened in the currency markets today for the first time in nearly eight months, but failed to turn the tide.
 Analysts said the Bank of Japan sold yen and bought dollars about three times during Tokyo trading, and briefly pushed the yen to 125.06 to the dollar from a peak value of 123.53. But later trading erased the move, and by late afternoon in New York the yen was back where it started the day, settling at 124.22. 
 The intervention came after comments by the finance minister, Masajuro Shiokawa, who called the yen's recent gains speculative and too rapid. The yen has risen 7.5 percent against the dollar since April 1.
The effort to halt the yen's rise is evidence of Japan's commitment to protecting one of the country's few sources of growth: exports. Last week, the cabinet of Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi said that the recession that began in late 2000 had ended, basing the declaration on rising shipments of goods to the United States and Asian neighbors.
The Bank of Japan seconded that view in its monthly report today, though it noted that consumer spending remained weak. 
Any faltering of exports would put Mr. Koizumi under heavy political pressure to propose a supplemental budget of extra spending, a step he is reluctant to take because of Japan's escalating fiscal deficit.
Many of the country's largest manufacturers, including Honda Motor and Matsushita Electric Industrial, depend heavily on overseas sales, and are banking on an exchange rate of about 125 yen to the dollar in their earnings forecasts. But sustaining that rate will be hard for Japanese policy makers.
"This is not only about the yen's appreciation, but also the slumping dollar," said Hideki Naito, managing analyst at Standard & Poor's/MMS in Tokyo. "If the dollar continues to drift lower, O'Neill won't say anything," he added, referring to Paul H. O'Neill, the American Treasury secretary.
The United States economy posted fairly strong growth in the first quarter, mostly because of strong consumer spending; other sectors remain less vigorous, including steel makers and other manufacturers who face cost pressure from foreign competition. A weakening dollar offers them some relief.
Japan's economy, meanwhile, is only just rumbling to life. Economists expect the first-quarter statistics, due in early June, to show growth for the first time in a year. The brighter outlook has attracted some foreign investors to buy Japanese stocks, adding upward pressure on the yen. The main stock index, the Nikkei 225, rose 1.4 percent today and is up 13.5 percent for the year.

HEADLINE: MAKING BOOKS; 
Embracing The Moonlight

BYLINE:  By Martin Arnold 

 BODY:
Harlem Moon. What exactly does that mean? Moon is light over darkness. Janet Hill, a book publishing executive, found a small ink-drawn crescent moon on an old map of Harlem showing its speak-easies. She said it made her think of the artists struggling to create under that moon during the Harlem Renaissance of the 20's and 30's, and then of those who are working now on their manuscripts under that particular light. 
 So she named her publishing imprint Harlem Moon. It is the newest one devoted to books of the African-American experience, that experience being everything from slavery to middle-class urban Americans struggling through recession and 9/11, and its first eight titles will be in the stores by September. 
 There are now five imprints in major book publishing companies committed to fiction (not romances) and nonfiction on black subjects. Harlem Moon will be different in that all its books will be stylishly designed trade paperbacks rather than hardcovers. This will make them economically accessible to more readers, book publishers having awakened only relatively recently to the fact that there's a growing black population ravenous for reading material relevant to them.
The new imprint will also publish a line of black classics that are now out of print, many in the public domain. Ms. Hill is the executive editor at Harlem Moon and remains an executive editor at Doubleday, where she will still edit hardcover fiction and nonfiction. Harlem Moon is an imprint of Broadway Books, part of the Doubleday Broadway division of Random House Inc., and will publish the paperback editions of many Broadway and Doubleday hardcover books on black subjects. 
Doubleday has a long tradition of publishing black writers, including Charles Waddell Chestnut, Booker T. Washington, Chester Himes, Billie Holiday, Alex Haley, Bill Cosby, Quincy Jones, J. California Cooper and now the best-selling novelist E. Lynn Harris, making the rise of Harlem Moon there not surprising.
Harlem Moon reflects Ms. Hill's vision that she is investing in writers as much as in product -- she apparently is not going for the obvious commercial barn-burners, but she certainly intends to make money -- and she says she wants to create a comfortable home for talents who can develop into selling authors who will be coveted by hardcover houses. It is a worthy, audacious gamble.
Ms. Hill said: "We're going to do fiction and nonfiction on a variety of subjects. There's an extraordinary, healthy black readership market who are hungry for that writing, and the climate is great for quality trade paperback. It's good for the writers, too. We can establish a market for them in trade paper, and then they can go to hardcover." 
Stephen Rubin, president and publisher of Doubleday Broadway, said: "The format speaks directly to the market and allows us to revive a lot of classics and also do the original titles. We couldn't do that with a different program."
Books don't have the same meaning for everyone. Max Rodriguez, publisher of QBR: The Black Book Review, said: "For blacks, books speak to a lifestyle. It's more then just reading; it's also what reading represents, education. Writers for us are still celebrities. We want to build our libraries of books we cherish, and that's a strong argument for hardcover. But the accessibility of the trade paperback -- good reading and good writing for good prices -- is also important, and people can build libraries with handsome trade paperbacks, too."
Harlem Moon was started on its way with some panache. On May 3 several hundred people attended a party in the Studio Museum in Harlem, at which Harlem Moon writers read excerpts from their books, and everyone was given a handsome 119-page sampler of excerpts.
The first Harlem Moon book to be in the stores will be the paperback reprint of Bertice Berry's "Haunting of Hip Hop," a novel published in hardcover last year by Doubleday. Its first list also includes "Dakota Grand" by Kenji Jasper and "Silkydreamgirl" by Cris Burks, novels, and "The Hip Hoptionary" by Alonzo Westbrook, a dictionary of hip-hop terms. Perhaps the showcase of the initial list will be "Gumbo," a collection of short stories edited by Mr. Harris and Marita Golden, an author and president of the Hurston/Wright Foundation, which supplies grants and other encouragement to black writers. All the money earned from that book will go to the foundation.
One of the problems Harlem Moon faces is that many publications don't run reviews of original trade paperbacks. The New York Times Book Review and The Washington Post Book World do, but most don't. (The Times's daily critics do review such books occasionally.) 
"I don't see as much resistance to reviewing trade paperbacks in the African-America media as there used to be, and I think the mainstream press is doing more, too," Ms. Hill said. "You can't overlook the importance of word of mouth in selling books, and that's very important among blacks." It could be that Harlem Moon books will force the reviewing of more original trade paperbacks.
The books will have first printings of about 20,000 copies, not a small number for high-quality books of the sort Harlem Moon wants to publish. Gerald Howard, editorial director of Broadway Books, said: "None of the books are blockbusters, but all are strong, and they range from commercial to the literary, and trade paperback gives them a longer life in the marketplace. It all doesn't have to happen in the first six weeks." Hardcover publishing is like the movies: titles hit quickly or disappear. Trade paper builds slowly.
"We are going to do quality," Mr. Howard said, "and with publishing African-American classic and buying trade paper rights for many hardcovers, we'll build a great backlist, and it's all in the backlist."
Whether these books will be "blazing the charts" and bringing in the "big face money" (read "Hip Hoptionary") no one can predict. But what is certain is that "big dawgs" at Random House Inc. are willing to roll a bet on Ms. Hill's sensibility. And why not? Last year she published "Crowns" (Doubleday), a photography and interview book by Michael Cunningham and Craig Marberry about black women and the hats they wore to church. It sold more than 80,000 copies.

HEADLINE: Reform That Leads to Chaos 

BYLINE:  By Peter H. Schuck; Peter H. Schuck is a professor at Yale Law School and author of the forthcoming "Diversity in America: Keeping Government at a Safe Distance."

 BODY:
With the possible exception of the I.R.S., the Immigration and Naturalization Service is the least popular agency in the federal government. Congress is so fed up with I.N.S. blunders that it is near a bipartisan agreement on a law dividing the immigration service into separate divisions for services and enforcement. The Bush administration, recognizing this political juggernaut, also favors this plan.
 But recent disclosures about the response of the F.B.I. and I.N.S. to terrorist threats show the need for more coordination within and among federal agencies, not less. Dividing the I.N.S. into two parts won't solve the agency's problems, and it won't make the immigration system better able to deal with the demands imposed on it by the war on terrorism. Any meaningful reform must begin with a careful reconsideration of the nation's immigration policy. 
 Reorganization has been proposed by blue-ribbon commissions since at least 1981 on the theory that the same agency that provides visas and other benefits for "good" immigrants should not be responsible for deporting "bad" ones. Although this seems plausible, separation will create new problems and aggravate old ones.
Benefits and sanctions are -- and should be -- closely linked. Many illegal aliens become legal immigrants; last year, for example, the I.N.S. issued more than 200,000 permanent visas -- over 20 percent of the total -- to previously illegal aliens. Moreover, reorganization invariably disrupts even well-run agencies by creating new lines of authority and operating routines. One can only imagine what it will do to the chaotic I.N.S.
The agency has few allies. But dividing its functions will not enhance support for the I.N.S.; the real problem is how it defines and performs its mission. As it is, many immigrants fear the agency's broad detention and deportation powers, while others dismiss it as a paper tiger that actually deports relatively few illegal aliens who make it inside the border. Human-rights groups denounce its frequent mistreatment of aliens. Employers scorn the agency's glacial pace and burdensome paperwork. Congress resents the agency's continued failures, especially after quadrupling its budget in the last decade. Federal judges, barred by a 1996 reform law from reviewing many important I.N.S. decisions, fume that the orders they can issue often have little effect. The current Congressional reform fails to address these issues.
Meanwhile, the failures of immigration policy are only getting worse. There are an estimated eight million to nine million illegal aliens in the United States today, almost twice as many as in 1986, when Congress adopted employer sanctions and a broad amnesty program. Many of these illegal aliens also commit crimes serious enough to warrant deportation, and the I.N.S. is under Congressional pressure to deport them. But in 2001, a record year for deporting criminal aliens, the I.N.S. failed to expel most of those eligible for deportation (even as it unfairly deported some who committed minor legal infractions many years ago). At the same time, the I.N.S. had in custody almost 5,000 unaccompanied minors, whose education and well-being it could not ensure.
Among those immigrants eligible for visas, citizenship or other benefits, a backlog of 4.9 million applications has accumulated. Red tape over visas turns honest workers and employers into lawbreakers and creates huge economic costs. And the relative education and job skills of legal immigrants may be declining, making their success here less likely.
I.N.S. incompetence has wasted large investments in computer technology; the agency cannot track the 700,000 foreign students in the United States, much less nonstudents who overstay their visas. Yet despite administrative failures -- its notice of approval of pilot training for Mohamed Atta, mailed months after Sept. 11, is only the most notorious -- Congress keeps adding to the agency's responsibilities in antiterrorism and other areas.
Instead of simply reorganizing the bureaucracy, Congress needs to consider more imaginative -- and less extreme -- remedies for these chronic problems. It could amend the 1996 law to restore the possibility of humanitarian waivers from deportation for aliens with close family ties to citizens. The I.N.S. could use community supervision to reduce unnecessary detentions. The employer sanctions law could be strengthened with stiffer penalties and private enforcement. More secure identity documents, sensitive to privacy concerns, could be developed. A point system like those used in Canada and Australia, which admit immigrants based on their skills, language ability, experience and family ties, could yield more productive and easily assimilated immigrants.
Reorganizing the I.N.S. before rethinking immigration policy in light of past failures and new challenges will not produce a more efficient or effective agency. Instead, it will deflect public attention from the difficult political choices that Congress must make but would rather avoid. Could it be that distraction is the whole point of this exercise?

PERSON: Charles Weissert Roll Jr. 

HEADLINE: Charles W. Roll Jr., 73, Polltaker For Prominent Political Leaders 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON

 BODY:
Charles W. Roll Jr., a political polltaker for prominent leaders like Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller of New York and co-author of a classic text on polling, died on May 12 at a hospital in Trenton. 
He was 73 and lived in Lawrenceville, N.J.
The cause was coronary and vascular complications, his family said.
 Mr. Roll and Albert H. Cantril, a public opinion analyst, wrote "Polls: Their Use and Misuse in Politics" (Basic Books, 1972), which The New York Times Book Review characterized as a "sensible book about public opinion polling by two pros." 
 It analyzed, among other things, the impact of polls on primary races and how they could make a good candidate drop out of the race. Mr. Roll and Mr. Cantril also discussed polltakers who provided favorable figures for public show but reserved the more realistic numbers for their clients.
While polling methods have evolved since its publication, the book presented general observations that endured and assured it a niche on the bookshelves of professionals in the field.
Charles Weissert Roll Jr. was born in Trenton and graduated from Princeton University in 1950. He was study director for the Gallup Organization from 1958 to 1977. In the 1970's he was president of Political Survey and Analysis, a firm founded by Archibald M. Crossley, who, along with Dr. George H. Gallup and Elmo Roper, developed the first system of using a scientifically selected random sample to gauge the opinions of an entire population.
Mr. Roll helped devise procedures to determine which respondents in early polls were likely to vote. Until 10 years ago he directed the Pennsylvania Poll of The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, which was highly regarded for its accuracy in forecasting election outcomes.
Mr. Roll is survived by a sister, Lenora R. Lloyd of Oldwick, N.J.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
How can the marketplace gauge fashions? Consider what to name the baby.

BYLINE:  By Virginia Postrel; Virginia Postrel is the author of "The Future and Its Enemies" and is writing a book on the increasing importance of aesthetics in the economy and society. E-mail: vpostrel@dynamist.com.

 BODY:
WHATEVER happened to Lisa, Mary, Karen, Susan and Kimberly?
 On top in the 1960's, they've been shoved aside by Emily, Madison, Hannah, Ashley and Alexis. Those were the most popular names for American girls born in 2001, according to data released last week by the Social Security Administration. 
 As for Michael, David, John, James and Robert -- the top five for boys in the 1960's -- only Michael remains. The others have been replaced by Jacob, Matthew, Joshua, and Christopher. (The lists are at www.ssa .gov/OACT/babynames.)
Nobody runs ads to persuade parents to choose Emily or Joshua for their newborns. No magazine editors dictate that Ryan is the new Michael.
But names still shift according to fashion. Once-popular names seem tired and out of date, new ones exciting. Old-fashioned names, like Emily, take on the allure of vintage clothing. Style revivals happen in names, too.
Contrary to what many critics of markets believe (and many fashion industry executives wish), fashion isn't a predictable commercial phenomenon driven by manipulation and advertising. Fashion -- the process by which form seems exhausted and then refreshed, without regard to functional improvements -- exists even in completely noncommercial "markets."
In "A Matter of Taste" (Yale University Press, 2000), Stanley Lieberson, a Harvard sociologist, analyzes how tastes in names shift. In the process, he sheds light on how fashion works.
Economists usually assume that tastes don't change. To explain shifts in demand, they look for changing relative prices. That approach imposes disciplinary rigor -- "tastes changed" could too easily explain just about anything -- but it makes accounting for fashion hard.
Professor Lieberson offers an explanation even an economist can accept. The taste for names or sounds may change, but those changes reflect underlying preferences for novelty, conformity and divergence.
Name choices, like clothing choices, reflect the desire to be different, but not too different. The ideal balance varies, and new fashions begin with innovators who want to stand out. If the innovations have the right aesthetic appeal, they spread to people who aren't as nonconformist.
"There must have been some people starting off with Madison," Professor Lieberson said in an interview. "That type of person is no longer naming their kid Madison."
Parents who today pick Madison for their daughter's name, he said, "would not have given the same name, the same sounds, earlier because it was a weird name."
Indeed, Madison didn't show up on the lists until the 1980's, when it was the decade's 539th most popular name. Three of last year's top 20 girls' names -- Madison (No. 2), Taylor (No. 12), and Brianna (No. 18) -- weren't in the top 1,000 in the 1960's. (Taylor was 865th for boys.)
Like designers who experiment with new ideas, parents have to choose babies' names without knowing exactly what other parents are choosing. The result is a complex, often surprising, dynamic.
Parents frequently find that the name they "just liked" is suddenly common, expressing aesthetic preferences. Professor Lieberson became interested in names after he and his wife named their first daughter Rebecca, only to find there were little Beckys everywhere.
Like hemlines, names don't bounce around randomly. Newly popular names tend to build on what has gone before, exploring the aesthetic possibilities of certain styles. "People are in effect branching off an existing set of tastes," Professor Lieberson says.
Beginning in the late 1960's, for instance, names beginning with La became popular for African-American girls. The first to hit the top 50, Latonya, was a play on the existing name Tonya. Latanya and Latasha similarly built on older names. "But then the La's developed a life of their own," Professor Lieberson notes, leading to brand-new names like Latoya and Latrice.
Although some ethnic names remain distinctive, those differences tend to dissipate over time. Today's list of top boys' names shows the influence of Latino immigrants -- Jose is No. 30, Luis No. 44, Carlos No. 55, Jesus No. 66 -- and the 1960's list reflects earlier Irish and Italian immigrants (and the influence of Catholic saints' names more generally). Over a relatively short period, however, immigrant families begin to select names from the general pool.
Professor Lieberson cites data from Illinois matching mothers' ethnicity with popular names. From 1985 to 1988, Jose was the fifth-most-popular boys' name among Mexican-American mothers. But it followed Michael, Daniel, David and Anthony.
Contrary to common assumptions about how fashion works, names don't simply trickle down from high-income, well-educated parents to lower-income, less-educated parents. Newly popular names tend to catch on with everyone at about the same time, and they spread both up and down.
Whether names or clothes, fashion reflects the primacy of individual taste over inherited custom. The freer people feel to choose names they like, rather than names of relatives or saints, the faster names go through cycles. Boys' names, which tend to be more influenced by custom, change slower.
The turnover, Professor Lieberson says, "is much faster now than it used to be," and a smaller proportion of all names are concentrated among the most popular. So there's a constant need for new names, as formerly unusual ones become too common.
"It will become apparent in a few years that there are tons of Madisons, and people will act accordingly," he says.
Maybe Saige (No. 939) or Ximena (No. 894) will be the next Madison. Or maybe Virginia, No. 391 today but No. 7 in the 1920's, is due for a revival.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING; 
Flush with infomercial cash, the company that makes OxiClean moves up to prime-time spots.

BYLINE:  By Bernard Stamler

 BODY:
LATE-NIGHT television is full of them: infomercials, those long, loud and often cheesy paeans to everything from investment schemes to Oriental cookware.
 But while these low-cost commercials and their direct-response cousins, the home shopping networks, reach only a small portion of the television audience, they are powerful marketing tools nonetheless. They can sometimes provide direct-response advertisers with sufficient success -- and cash -- for them to pursue mainstream audiences with more traditional and expensive advertising. 
 Orange Glo International, a privately held manufacturer of cleaning products, is the latest to make the sometimes risky leap from late-night television to prime time. The estimated $30 million a year it says it has been spending on its two signature products, Orange Clean and OxiClean, has been reallocated from infomercials to a campaign that uses 30-second television commercials. Infomercials continue for other Orange Glo products. 
The spots were created by McClain Finlon Advertising, an independent shop in Denver, and are running on shows like "Will & Grace," "Third Watch," the "Today" show and "Late Show With David Letterman." Orange Glo is also buying ads on billboards and in magazines like Good Housekeeping, Ebony, Rosie and Better Homes and Gardens.
The company, which began in the suburban Denver garage of its founder, Max Appel, in 1986, at first used trade shows and word of mouth to sell its products, including Orange Clean, a liquid-spray cleaner for hard surfaces, and OxiClean, a white powder that oxidizes and breaks up organic stains. While sales were brisk, according to Joel Appel, who is Max's son and the company president, Orange Glo wanted more. 
"We realized that television is the way to get your business out of the garage and into the real world," Joel Appel said. So Orange Glo began selling its products on the Home Shopping Network in 1997, he said, and began using infomercials as well the next year. These featured a loud, enthusiastic pitchman, Billy Mays, demonstrating the stain-removing power of the products.
The strategy paid off, Mr. Appel said. Last year, Orange Glo International, based in Greenwood Village, Colo., reported sales of $240 million. Its products are now available in retailers like Bed Bath & Beyond and Wal-Mart. OxiClean powder is now third in sales in its category nationwide, according to Information Resources of Chicago, which tracks consumer product sales. 
That performance makes Orange Glo a direct competitor to consumer product giants like Procter & Gamble and S.C. Johnson & Son, companies that usually rely upon regular advertising.
And its status prompted a new marketing approach. "There's only so far that an infomercial can take you," said Cindy Heller, Orange Glo's marketing director. "For these products, we need greater reach and greater frequency." 
The new commercials also have a different tone, forsaking the earnestness of the infomercials for humor. In one of the vignettes for OxiClean, for example, stocky college football players don prom dresses and roll in a field of blueberry pies. A spokesman -- not Mr. Mays -- then applies a solution containing OxiClean to the stained items, which are immediately restored to their pristine state. 
"If you didn't see it with your own eyes," the spokesman says, "you probably wouldn't believe it."
The reason for the new approach is simple, said Tom Leydon, executive creative director at McClain Finlon. "We are setting out to reach a different audience, one that does not respond to infomercials."
But Orange Glo's decision to swear off direct-response marketing does not come without risks. Nordic Trak, the exercise equipment maker, gave up the direct-marketing approach for a major retail push in the late 1990's, only to go bankrupt soon afterward, said Elissa Matulis Myers, president of the Electronic Retailing Association, a trade association. One product that is successfully sold with both direct-response and more traditional advertising is the George Foreman electric grill, she added. 
But Jack Myers, chief economist at the Jack Myers firm in New York, which publishes media and research newsletters, says the move to regular ads is logical and inevitable.
"Once you're in retail distribution, you almost have to pull out of infomercials," he said. "Otherwise, you would be in competition with yourself."

HEADLINE: Panel Led by U.S. Criticizes Sudan's Government Over Slavery 

BYLINE:  By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: KHARTOUM, Sudan, May 22 

 BODY:
An international commission led by the United States condemned the Sudanese government today for allowing slavery to flourish in this war-ravaged country.
 But the commission said the issue was not as clear-cut as it was often portrayed. Panel members also questioned whether international Christian organizations that buy slaves and free them are helping the situation, saying it would be better if slaves were released with no money changing hands. Critics say the payments may help create a market for slaves. 
 Government officials have long denied any role in what they call tribal abductions. As a show of concern, in 1999 Sudan created the Commission for the Elimination of Abductions of Women and Children to address the problem. Few outside experts take the group seriously.
But the panel, which was created this year by the United States and includes officials from France, Italy, Norway and Britain, said in a report issued today that Sudan had done too little to control a practice that is largely carried out by militiamen armed by the government.
"They burn villages, loot cattle, rape and kill civilians and abduct and enslave men, women and children," the panel said in its report, which includes interviews with many former slaves.
The findings will come as no surprise to American policy makers, who have long accused Sudan of tacitly allowing slavery. John C. Danforth, President Bush's special envoy for the country, who helped to create the panel, said in a report to Mr. Bush last month, "The record is clear: the government arms and directs marauding raiders who operate in the south, destroying villages and abducting women and children to serve as chattel servants, herders and field hands."
The panel found no easy answers. It said the government ought to aggressively prosecute those who engage in slavery and actively seek the return of captives to their homes.
Led by Penn Kemble, a former director of the United States Information Agency, the commission found that a wide variety of economic relationships exist among the Sudanese. Many of them are exploitative, like bondage to pay off debts, but fall short of slavery.
It also said slavery is a long-standing practice in Sudan, even though it was made illegal in 1924.
The modern version of slavery, the commission found, exists without slave markets or a formal slave trade. Instead, raiders attack villages, most often those near the north-south divide, to round up forced laborers.
The report said the problem was most troublesome among the government-backed militias that guard the military supply train that runs from Babanusa through rebel-held territory in Bahr el Ghazal to Wau in the south. The commission called for the government to stop running the train until the end of the war.
The commission gave no estimate of the number of slaves in the country. Previous figures have ranged from 10,000 to more than 10 times that. The commission said both the government and the southern rebels had obstructed previous efforts at counting.
The rebels were also said to have abducted villagers, particularly in the Western Upper Nile area, and to have forced civilians to join them. Both sides, the commission reported, have engaged in human rights violations from rape and hostage taking to intentional attacks on civilians.

HEADLINE: Garment District Past for Sale; 
Hardware Store's Shelves Display a Bygone Era

BYLINE:  By LESLIE EATON 

 BODY:
The history of New York City's garment district is on display -- or at least jumbled in a heap in a corner -- at Simon Greenspan Hardware, on West 35th Street just east of Eighth Avenue.
 Garter-belt clips? Got 'em. Button-making supplies? Got 'em. Hangers that predate plastic? Kerosene lamps? Window-screen patches? Parts for machines no one has used since the Hoover administration? The shelves are brimming, and you should see the basement. 
 "Why throw it out?" said Ronald Bernard Wittie, the proprietor, holding a circular piece of steel that he thinks dates from before 1931 (he has a boxful). "I keep it in case some 90-year-old comes in and needs it." He added, "I haven't sold any yet in 20 years."
The store, which has been in its current location since the early 1930's, specializes in supplies for the garment industry. That industry, once perhaps the biggest and most important business in New York City, has been declining for decades.
Employment has tumbled from 250,000 in the early 1900's to 100,000 in the late 1980's to 50,000 today (and that's on a good day). The sewing factories that used to fill buildings in the West 30's have been replaced by financial firms and computer consultants and the like. Many shops that used to supply the factories with notions and needles have disappeared.
Not Simon Greenspan, but that seems to have less to do with its health as a business and more to do with the personality of Mr. Wittie, who is 69 and known universally as Bernie. "I just keep it because I have nothing else to do," he said. "I retired and didn't like it. It's someplace to come besides a bar."
So he spends his days hanging out, smoking what he says are 41-cent cigars and wisecracking with Bob behind the counter and Keith the delivery guy and Dorian Yeager, a writer, actress and old pal who does the books.
"I come in three days a week, only because Bernie wants me in here," she said, sitting at a computer surrounded by papers, peanuts, rubber stamps, sunflower seeds and treats for the three stray cats currently in residence. "Bernie is very supportive of everybody," she said, "sort of a one-man welfare program."
When things are slow, which is often, Mr. Wittie plays solitaire on the computer, sometimes spending three or four hours until he masters a game of Free Cell (No. 11982 is his favorite, because he hasn't been able to win it yet). It's kind of a substitute for the all-night card parties he used to love, back when he owned parking garages and ran a towing service.
He listens to the radio, reads the paper, and chats with regulars like John Follo, the superintendent of a nearby building, who for reasons that remain obscure actually got married in the store on Feb. 28. ("City Hall gave us a hard time," he explained, and Ms. Yeager, a notary public, says she is licensed to perform weddings.)
Occasionally, customers will wander in, looking for light bulbs or duct tape or something more offbeat, and someone will yell, "Yo, Bern, you got a socket connector?" and hold something up in the air. "Ask Bob," he replies. (Bob, Robert P. Delmonico, is only 23, but his father used to work in the store, and Bob is the only person who knows exactly where everything is.)
While they are waiting, customers usually poke around, checking out the used sewing dummies that lurk in the corners, poking through boxes of buckles or buttons or thread.
Customers who are actually in the market for buttons will get a bargain (Bernie sells them by the pound), especially if they are willing to venture into the back room or the basement. Gray, black and ivory buttons; silver ones and gold ones; pink, orange, and fuchsia buttons are all piled up like pirate treasure. Closed boxes bear alluring labels like, "Burnished Brass/Soft Copper."
Deals on the used dummies also attract customers like Doreen Rutty, who teaches fashion at the Katherine Gibbs School and also sews fancy clothes for children. Mr. Wittie offered to sell her a "chubby" child dummy for $100, which he said was hundreds of dollars less than it would cost new.
Sometimes someone will want some hangers or plastic garment bags -- once the store's staples -- so Bob or Keith Lanier will go to the cavernous basement and poke through moldering cardboard boxes.
"Some of this stuff has been down here for 20 years, 15 years," Mr. Lanier said, winding through shelves covered with decades of dust. "But we don't buy no more, because the garment industry is dying down."
It wasn't always this way. When Mr. Wittie and a partner bought the store from the Greenspan family in 1986, he said, they had three countermen and nine delivery boys. Revenues were as much as $3.5 million a year.
Then business began to dwindle. Mr. Wittie blames Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's administration, which allowed landlords to chop up the floors that had housed the sewing factories and rent out the space as offices.
But economics was also at work. Customers began to disappear. So did suppliers. So did competitors, like the hardware store from which Mr. Wittie inherited the tin man in his store window. 
For a while, Mr. Wittie adapted. He bought the contents of places that closed. Often, factories that were closing gave him things, because it was cheaper than paying trash haulers, he said. Building superintendents stuck with cleaning out defunct stores and factories would sell or give usable debris to Mr. Wittie, and to this day garbage pickers turn up with things like dummies, hoping to sell them.
"I could give you a whole list of customers who went out of business," Mr. Wittie said, pulling out a sheaf of envelopes that had been returned by the Postal Service as undeliverable. 
For the last three years, Mr. Wittie said, the store has lost money. He has kept it going on the gains of his stock portfolio (he has been investing $5 a week since 1954).
But his portfolio had not been doing well recently, and he had been planning to close the store in July or August. He has since changed his mind, because he thinks the market is coming back, he said. Still, he has less than four years left on his lease, and when it is up, that will be the end of Simon Greenspan Hardware.
But not of the folding hat racks and plastic hangers, button drills and bubble wrap, not to mention the very used cans of paint. When he moves out, Mr. Wittie plans to leave all that stuff behind. Because, he said, "Who wants it?"

HEADLINE: Severe Water and Land Loss Predicted Over a Generation 

BYLINE:  By ANDREW C. REVKIN

 BODY:
Expansion of cities, destruction of forests, erosion of fields and rising demand for water are likely to threaten human and ecological health in many countries for at least a generation, according to a new United Nations report on environmental trends.
 The world has seen significant environmental progress in recent years, says the report, which was released yesterday by the United Nations Environment Program. Population growth is slowing, for example, and food production is largely keeping pace with it. 
 But the report warns of severe water shortages in the Middle East over the next generation, and it says the growth of agriculture is damaging landscapes, depleting aquifers, raising the level of salt in the soil and reducing habitat for wildlife. 
It also includes some bleak findings, cast in a manner that is rarely seen in United Nations reports -- with no path leading to a good result. Even under scenarios in which environmental protection becomes a high priority, it says, most regions of the world will still see their biological diversity and coastal ecosystems badly damaged by 2032.
The report says an important cause is the accelerating growth of vast, poor and largely unplanned cities in developing countries, most of them near coastlines. Increased sewage, storm runoff, and conversion of land around such cities will inevitably produce more human disease and kill more marine life, it says.
Such environmental damage often ends up hampering economic growth, the report says, noting that damage to farmland in India is cutting agricultural productivity there by about $2.4 billion a year. 
The analysis, the third in a series begun in 1997, involved more than 1,000 scientists and a host of international research centers and agencies. It was issued as 140 countries prepared for talks starting tomorrow in Bali to finish planning for the World Summit on Sustainable Development, a meeting of world leaders in Johannesburg in late August focused on meshing economic growth and environmental protection. That meeting is widely viewed as a 10-year checkup to see how the world has fared since the United Nations Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. 
"Without the environment, there can never be the kind of development needed to secure a fair deal for this or future generations," Klaus Toepfer, the executive director of the United Nations Environment Program, said at a news conference in London at which the new report was discussed.
Already, the report says, five billion acres of soil, more than the area of the United States and Canada combined, is degraded by human activity, with a sixth of that "strongly or extremely degraded." Most of the damage has come through water and wind erosion and excessive grazing.
The report says water shortages will be particularly acute in a zone running from the Arabian Peninsula north through Syria and Iraq, with more than 90 percent of the population in that region living in what it called "severe water stress" by 2032.
In considering what may happen in the next 30 years, the report looks at a variety of social and economic scenarios -- from one in which all countries focus mainly on promoting growth to one in which they seek to balance environmental, social and economic progress.
It concludes that serious additional harm is likely without more focus on meshing economic growth with environmental planning.
The analysis does find that substantial reductions in air and water pollution in industrialized countries in the past three decades can potentially be copied by poorer countries. 
It also notes that protected preserves have grown steadily for 30 years, to 4.7 million square miles worldwide in 2000 from 1.07 million in 1970. And it cites a study of 93 protected areas finding that most are blocking the clearing of land, though they are not as effective at preventing illegal logging, poaching, fires and grazing.

HEADLINE: Portland Voters Endorse Curbs On City Growth 

BYLINE:  By TIMOTHY EGAN

 BODY:
Voters in the Portland metropolitan area have turned down an initiative that would have severely weakened how elected officials can determine the shape of new urban areas. It was an endorsement of land-use restrictions that have made Oregon a national model for controlling growth.
The ballot measure, brought by developers frustrated at strict rules on housing density, would have taken away the power of a regional governing body known as Metro to control how tightly houses are packed into neighborhoods. 
 The vote on Tuesday was 57 percent against the initiative, 43 percent in favor. 
 Oregon has long championed a state law aimed at restricting urban sprawl. The law requires cities and towns of a certain size to draw a boundary around their urban areas, keeping forests, farmlands and open space free of development. Since the law was passed in 1973, voters on three other occasions have turned down efforts to weaken or eliminate it. 
The biggest legacy of the law has been modern Portland, a metropolitan area built more along the lines of some European cities, with its mass transit system, compact neighborhoods and protected forests and farms outside the city limits. 
But builders, property rights advocates and some environmentalists have complained that Metro's enforcement of the law has put far too many homes into tightly drawn urban areas and has pushed up housing prices by restricting land available for building. 
Supporters of the state's urban growth plans have said that the law has allowed Oregon to do what few other fast-growing areas have been able to do: permitted new housing while still protecting rural character at the edge of cities. 
The vote was seen as a referendum on how Metro applied the law. Metro controls land use, conservation and transportation issues for 24 cities and three counties holding 1.3 million people in the Portland area.
"There was no groundswell of sentiment against how Portland has shaped its urban destiny," said David Bragdon, who helped to lead the fight against the initiative. 
Ethan Seltzer, an urban planning professor at Portland State University, said the vote was an endorsement, even in a recession, of Portland's restrictions of growth. 
"There are an awful lot of people who are comfortable with the idea that the planning that's occurring is still making things better rather than worse," Mr. Seltzer said.

HEADLINE: School Budgets Are Approved In Most New York State Districts 

BYLINE:  By ELISSA GOOTMAN 

 BODY:
In a year when many of New York State's school districts proposed budgets that would raise taxes more than in recent years, 89 percent of school budgets passed in elections held Tuesday. 
 That approval rate was lower than last year, when 92 percent of the budgets passed on the first vote. But many education officials took heart yesterday that Tuesday's success rate was higher than the average rate since 1969: 82 percent. 
 "We would not have been surprised had the defeat rate been far higher," said David Ernst, a spokesman for the New York State School Boards Association. "A lot of districts were asking a lot out there of communities, and a lot of communities responded positively."
But this year's school budgets fared less well on Long Island, where 20 out of 126 budgets failed -- double the number rejected on the first try last year. In some cases, residents appeared to be reacting against conflicts in the school district or budgets that called for particularly large tax increases; in others, there was no obvious reason.
"There may be as many different reasons for a budget going down as there are budgets going down," Mr. Ernst said. 
Some educators blamed the state for giving less money last year than the districts had hoped for, forcing the districts to dip into their reserves and, as a result, draft budgets this year that would allow them to replenish those reserves. At the same time, they said, some districts were conservative in estimating how much the state could be expected to contribute, possibly overestimating the tax burden that would fall on residents. 
By law, districts have an opportunity to resubmit the same budget for a second vote or submit an amended budget. If the second proposal fails, the district must revert immediately to an austerity budget, meaning it can increase expenditures by no more than 4 percent. Of the 75 budgets defeated on Tuesday, 20 were on Long Island. Of those, 15 were in Suffolk County. Five budgets were defeated in Orange County, three in Putnam and one each in Westchester and Rockland Counties.
Dr. Bruce Brodsky, co-chairman of the Long Island Education Coalition, said he believed that many budgets were rejected for simple economic reasons.
"I would think that the average voter out there who voted no on the budget said, 'Folks, I just can't afford to pay any more at this time,' " Dr. Brodsky said. "Twenty budgets have not failed since at least some time in the mid-1980's." 
In some districts, rejected budgets appeared to be votes of no-confidence against bickering school boards or plummeting test scores.
In Roosevelt, in Nassau County, which recently made history by becoming the first school district in New York to be taken over by the state, an 18 percent budget increase passed, ending a recent streak of budget failures.

HEADLINE: Skip-the-Ads TV Has Madison Ave. Upset 

BYLINE:  By AMY HARMON

 BODY:
Digital successors to the VCR that eliminate the frustration of recording television programs have crossed a popularity threshold, raising alarm among advertisers and TV executives who see the devices as a threat to the economics of commercial television.
 Digital video recorders, or DVR's, make it so easy to program and play back shows -- they do away with videotapes by storing 30 hours or more on a hard disk -- that their owners often choose to watch what is on the machine rather than what is on TV. Ignoring the networks' painstakingly planned schedules, they watch prime-time programs late at night and late-night programs before dinner, often oblivious to the channel on which it originally appeared. 
 They also see fewer than half the commercials they used to, compressing hourlong shows into 40 minutes as they fast-forward through the advertisements that the television industry has long depended on to pay for its programming and profits.
One in five people who own a DVR like TiVo or ReplayTV say they never watch any commercials, according to a recent survey from Memphis-based NextResearch. 
Numbers like that have provoked gloomy pronouncements from industry executives. Some even come close to accusing habitual ad skippers of theft.
"The free television that we've all enjoyed for so many years is based on us watching these commercials," said Jamie C. Kellner, chief executive of Turner Broadcasting. "There's no Santa Claus. If you don't watch the commercials, someone's going to have to pay for television and it's going to be you."
But such admonishments appear unlikely to sway DVR owners. By recording the shows they know they want to see, many say they have escaped the scourge of channel-surfing and the empty sense of wasted time so often associated with watching TV. Although sales of DVR's are still small compared with those of other home entertainment devices like DVD players, analysts say the remarkable enthusiasm they inspire makes their broad adoption only a matter of time.
"I can do e-mail and I can go on the Internet but I've never been able to program the VCR," said Kay Friedman, 66, of Morton Grove, Ill., a TiVo owner who takes special delight in waiting until 9:20 to watch "The Practice" on Sundays so she can skip through the commercials even as it records. "I'm hooked."
Dismissed until recently as too expensive and complex for the average consumer to set up, DVR's are now a fixture in more than a million United States households -- about 1 percent of the total -- a number expected to grow to 50 million over the next five years, according to Forrester Research. Fueling the growth are cable and satellite companies, who plan to build DVR features into their set-top boxes, greatly simplifying the set-up process. Cox Communications, Time Warner and Charter Communications have already announced plans to make these services available to consumers later this year.
TiVo, which markets its own DVR and licenses its service to others, costs $300 to $400, plus a $12.95 monthly fee. Sonicblue's ReplayTV 4000 costs $699 for 40 hours up to $1,999 for 320 hours of storage; the company said it expected sales to increase when it introduces a lower-priced machine later this year.
The television industry has known about DVR's for years, of course. But as the popularity of the digital technology begins to undermine many of the basic assumptions that have governed the television business for decades, broadcasters, cable programmers and advertisers are scrambling both to resist and to adapt to people who can rearrange schedules and skip commercials at the press of a button.
"You start losing marginal dollars when people who you thought you were buying are not viewing," said Daniel Jaffe, executive vice president of the Association of National Advertisers. "This is not just a theoretical problem that might be happening somewhere down the line. This is happening now."
Some advertisers are re-evaluating their buying strategies and demanding new ways of measuring audiences. Steve Sternberg, director of audience analysis for the advertising firm Magna Global USA, circulated a memo recently that asked, "If an advertiser buys 'NYPD Blue' on Tuesday night, and 10 percent of its audience watches it on Friday after midnight, should that audience be given equal value as the 'live' prime- time audience?"
There is an important distinction, Mr. Sternberg said, between "zipping and zapping": "When people switch channels, they are going from something to something else. There are losses for one channel, but gains for another. With fast-forwarding there are only losses."
Others are trying to turn the technology to their advantage. Coca-Cola has paid for advertising that appears on the screen of a ReplayTV user when a viewer pauses a program for more than a few minutes. Last week, Best Buy announced that it would embed electronic tags visible only to TiVo users in 30-second commercials featuring the singer Sheryl Crow it is running on MTV. Viewers can click on an icon to see 12 additional minutes of the Best Buy "advertainment," while TiVo records the continuing MTV programming so they can watch it later.
"We need to start to understand how we're going to have to reach our consumers with this new technology," said Mollie Weston, a product manager for Best Buy's image advertising. "It is going to force us to put advertisements out there that people are actually going to choose to watch."
Indeed, advertisers take heart in data from TiVo that showed its viewers fast-forwarding through this year's Super Bowl and using the instant replay function for the Britney Spears Pepsi commercial more than any other segment besides the winning field goal. 
Because DVR's are connected by a phone or high-speed Internet line from a viewer's home to a central server to get program schedules, some advertisers envision downloading commercials aimed at individual people based on information from databases compiled through other sources. Members of Purina pet clubs might get pet food commercials, for instance, while the owner of a BMW lease that is about to expire might get an advertisement on the automaker's new convertible.
"There's a lot of things that are going to start to change," said Ira Sussman, director of research for Initiative Media North America, an advertising buyer whose clients include Maybelline and Home Depot. "We're going to have to start thinking more about the importance of product placement within programs, placing more relevant, highly targeted messages. But we see it as a glass half full."
His research reflected a less rosy picture for the television networks, however. "We've found people recording programs and watching them on their own time are often not realizing what network they're coming from anymore," Mr. Sussman said. "That's a real brand equity that might be lost on the networks' part, if you're trying to put something next to 'Friends' but no one's watching 'Friends' live."
Much of the television industry's response to the new technology so far has focused on a lawsuit that seeks to ban the sale of the newest version of ReplayTV, which allows its customers to set it up to skip commercials on playback automatically, without even requiring them to fast-forward. The machine also allows its owners to send shows to each other over the Internet.
A group of media companies including Viacom Inc., the NBC television network, the Walt Disney Company, AOL Time Warner Inc. and Twentieth Century Fox has asked a federal court in Los Angeles to stop Sonicblue from selling the device, saying it contributes to copyright infringement. To win, they need to prove that the machine is fundamentally different from the VCR, whose distribution was upheld by the Supreme Court in 1984 after a similar challenge by the entertainment industry.
Lawyers for the companies now argue that the court's endorsement of consumers' right to "time shift" television programming in the 1984 case was based on the assumption that copyright holders would not suffer significant financial damage as a result. Over the protests of privacy advocates, they are demanding detailed information about which shows ReplayTV owners record and which commercials they skip.
Sonicblue's chief executive, Ken Potashner, concedes that on average ReplayTV users skip more than half the commercials. But he says it is up to the networks and advertisers to come up with creative ways to persuade viewers to watch. The ReplayTV machine records all the commercials, and users must choose to set it to skip them automatically on playback. They can always reset it if they choose.
"What are they going to attack next, the mute button?" Mr. Potashner said. "We've provided an efficiency improvement for a consumer who is compelled to skip a commercial. What they should do is work with us."
A victory in the companies' case against Sonicblue will not stave off the fundamental shift in culture undermining their business, industry analysts say. Consumers have embraced digital technology that allows them the greatest flexibility in the way they shop, communicate and consume all kinds of media -- and it is not likely to be different in TV.
"We've trained people that you can buy things at 3 in the morning in the nude on the Internet and make a call to anyone from anywhere on a cellphone, and the idea that CBS is going to determine when I watch 'CSI' flies in the face of that trend," said Josh Bernoff, an analyst with Forrester Research. "TV networks are going to have to figure out how to make money from a TV viewer that is not nailed to the chair waiting for the commercial to end."
If it is good enough, even dedicated DVR owners can still be tempted to watch live television, complete with its inconvenient interludes. Chad Little, a ReplayTV owner who started a Web site called Planetreplay.com, where viewers can trade with each other, regularly records about 10 shows, including "Junkyard Wars," and "Everybody Loves Raymond." Sometimes he makes an exception:
"Buffy," Mr. Little said, referring to the vampire slayer. "There's times I'll watch it straight through with commercials and everything."

HEADLINE: Design Firm Chosen to Oversee Rebuilding of Lower Manhattan 

BYLINE:  By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
Beyer Blinder Belle, the design firm that oversaw the restoration of Grand Central Terminal and converted Ellis Island into the National Museum of Immigration, was chosen yesterday as the urban planning consultant to oversee the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan.
 The Lower Manhattan Development Corporation and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced the selection after two weeks of reviewing bids from 15 architecture and design firms. Beyer Blinder will be assisted in the project by Parsons Brinckerhoff, a transportation consulting firm, and 11 other specialty design and engineering firms. 
 The selection was a result of a remarkably quick process, beginning only four weeks ago when the development corporation, the agency charged with overseeing the rebuilding, and the Port Authority, owner of the World Trade Center's land, called for bidders. The process is unlikely to slow, as Beyer Blinder has only until about the end of June to come up with six options for the design of the World Trade Center site and the surrounding area. 
As part of those plans, the firm will be expected to make recommendations about transportation, parks, waterfront access, new retail areas, and civic and cultural institutions.
"This team was chosen on the basis of experience, technical qualifications, personnel and understanding of New York and the surrounding region," said Joseph J. Seymour, the executive director of the Port Authority. "They have shown a striking sense of vision, personal commitment and sensitivity to the nature of a project that is unlike any other."
Beyer Blinder will not, however, be entering a project that begins with a blank slate. In the eight months since the World Trade Center was destroyed, hundreds of architecture firms, civic groups and individuals have proposed designs for memorials, buildings and other projects that could reshape downtown.
Many of those plans were unsolicited and will have little effect on what actually happens. But others are likely to weigh heavily on the decisions that are made over the next seven months. By the end of the year, redevelopment officials have said, a single plan will be completed.
The starting point for that plan almost certainly will be several proposals already made public. Among them, Lower Manhattan Development has issued its own blueprint for the future of Lower Manhattan; Larry A. Silverstein, who holds the lease to the World Trade Center properties, has had his architects, the firm Skidmore Owings & Merrill, draw up plans for the site; and the Port Authority has expressed its feelings about what should happen above and below ground. 
Some transportation projects, like the rebuilding of the subway lines and the construction of a temporary station for the PATH commuter railroad, have already begun.
Beyer Blinder's job will be to "complement and support ongoing planning efforts," according to the request for proposals that led to the firm's selection, meaning that plans that have already received the support of officials at the Port Authority and at Lower Manhattan Development will certainly influence what is built on the site and how Lower Manhattan emerges from the disaster.
In its proposal for selection, Beyer Blinder promised an open, collaborative process.
"The challenge will be to do it with the right touch of respect and invention," the firm said.
The public is likely to get its first chance to hear from, or at least see, principals from Beyer Blinder tonight at a public hearing to discuss the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation's blueprint. The hearing is scheduled for 6 p.m. in the Michael Schimmel Center at Pace University, across Park Row from City Hall. The hearing will also be shown live on Pace University's Web site, www.pace.edu.
Beyond Grand Central and Ellis Island, Beyer Blinder's projects have included the Ford Center for the Performing Arts on West 42nd Street; several residential towers in Manhattan; the remodeling of Rockefeller Center; renovations at La Guardia Airport; master plans for Columbia University and Governors Island; and a master plan for Queens West, a mixed-use development in Long Island City, Queens. 
The selection process was temporarily delayed this week when two firms, Beyer Blinder and Ehrenkrantz Eckstut & Kuhn, nearly tied in the ratings they received from a six-person selection committee. After questions were raised about the scoring system used by one of the committee members, the panel was told to re-evaluate the two firms.
In the end, Beyer Blinder came out on top.
Included in the consortium with Beyer Blinder and Parsons Brinckerhoff are Olin Partnership, for landscape planning; Urbanomics, for economic studies; Mueser Rutledge Consulting Engineers; PACO Group, for security planning; Abrams-Cherwony & Associates, for bus transit planning; Philip Habib & Associates, traffic forecasting; Simco Engineering, traffic consulting; Steven Winter Associates, for specialty planning; Ysrael A. Seinuk, for structural engineering; VJ Associates, for cost estimating; and the Environmental Simulation Center, for three-dimensional computer database work. 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 27, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article on Thursday about the choice of the design firm of Beyer Blinder Belle to oversee the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan misstated the deadline for the firm's delivery of six options for the design of the World Trade Center site and the surrounding area. It is sometime in July, not the end of June.

Warning Came From Captive
The source of a tip that terrorists might hit the Brooklyn Bridge or the Statue of Liberty was the most senior Qaeda operative captured since Sept. 11, Abu Zubaydah, and that was one reason New York City officials took the threat so seriously, a senior law enforcement official said. A1

The White House asked the F.B.I. and several intelligence agencies shortly after Sept. 11 for any information about a threat by Al Qaeda that should have been reported to the National Security Council, officials said. But the request failed to unearth the F.B.I. memo warning that Osama bin Laden's followers could be training at flight schools. A26

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING -- ADDENDA; 
Report Cites a Rise In Spending on Ads

BYLINE:  By Bernard Stamler

 BODY:
In a sign that marketers may be gradually starting to spend again, advertising in major media increased 0.4 percent in the first quarter of 2002, compared with the period last year, according to a report yesterday from CMR in New York, a division of Taylor Nelson Sofres that tracks ad spending.
 The increase, to $23.5 billion from $23.4 billion, was attributed partly to ad spending in connection with the Winter Olympics in February as well as Easter's falling in March. 
Last year, Easter was in April. 
 The medium with the highest percentage increase in ad spending was Spanish-language network television, up 17.5 percent.
Other media with advertising growth were network radio, up 12.3 percent, and Sunday newspaper magazines, up 11.9 percent. The medium with the largest decline in ad spending in the quarter was cable TV, down 16 percent. Other media experiencing declines were syndicated television, down 14.4 percent, and the Internet, down 14.2 percent.
The two advertisers spending the most on advertising so far this year were General Motors, which spent 9.7 percent more, and Procter & Gamble, which spent 12.3 percent more. In the top 10, Pfizer increased spending the most, by 38.2 percent, and DaimlerChrysler decreased spending the most, by 23.6 percent.
The CMR report came after a report by Nielsen Monitor Plus, part of VNU, showing that ad spending in the first quarter rose 1.8 percent, compared with the first quarter of 2001. The two companies include different media in their reports so their results differ.



CORRECTION-DATE: May 25, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An entry in the Addenda listing on the Media Business page on Thursday about advertising spending in the first quarter of 2002, as reported by the tracking company CMR, misstated the percentage change in several categories compared with figures in the quarter a year earlier. For media that showed increases, Spanish-language network television gained 21.2 percent, not 17.5 percent; network radio rose 14 percent, not 12.3 percent; and Sunday newspaper magazines were up 13.5 percent, not 11.9 percent. For those with declines, cable television fell 13.8 percent, not 16 percent; syndicated television dropped 12.6 percent, not 14.4 percent; and the Internet was down 12.4 percent, not 14.2 percent.

RESNIK, PAUL

 BODY:
 RESNIK-Paul. 64. Died at his home in Santa Fe, NM, on May 20, 2002 from esophageal cancer. Mr. Resnik was born February 12, 1938 and grew up in Stamford, CT. He was the son of Dr. William Resnik, a well-known cardiologist, and Lorraine Smith Resnik, a musicologist. He is survived by a sister, Kate Resnik Adler, a retired psychologist, of Easton, MD. Mr. Resnik graduated from Brooks School, Yale College and Harvard Law School. He also attended the London School of Economics. In his early career he worked for the Agency for International Development, U.S.State Department, serving in Washington, DC and Uruguay. Later he was a corporate lawyer for ITT in the U.S. and Europe. He also founded The Wine Bar in New York City which he modeled after similar places in Paris. On the basis of his own experience he wrote a book called "The Small Business Bible," which was subsequently translated into several different languages. He then incorporated the principles described in "The Small Business Bible" into a joint project with Yale University to help inner-city kids think and express themselves. Mr. Resnik moved from New York to Santa Fe in 1998 and immersed himself in an array of local artistic and philanthropic activities. Among the institutions he supported were the School for American Research and the Southwest Literary Center. In recognition of his contributions, the Southwest Literary Center has announced that a Paul Resnik Narrative Center will be established in his name. 
He was deeply interested in books and ideas and loved music, art, theater, movies, politics and history. His many friends considered him a man for all seasons, a renaissance man, with a strong social conscience and a searching inquiring mind, an irreverent wit and a deep humanitarian spirit. He was in the process of researching a bold new work on the 1912 elections at the time of his death. Friends are planning a memorial service on July 3 in Santa Fe. In lieu of flowers memorial gifts may be sent to Brooks School Library, North Andover, MA.

HEADLINE: Fingers Crossed Downtown As Firms Consider Moving 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The third largest accounting firm in the world, KPMG, is negotiating a deal to move its offices downtown, from Park Avenue in Midtown, a relocation that would buoy a business district still suffering from the Sept. 11 terrorist attack.
 A Midtown law firm, Richards Spears Kibbe & Orbe, is already making the trek to Lower Manhattan, where rents are a lot lower than in the uptown towers. 
 But even as downtown landlords are crossing their fingers that KPMG will complete its deal for 500,000 square feet at 1 World Financial Center, a large insurance company, Aon, is moving in the opposite direction. The company, which had offices in the World Trade Center, has decided to create a new home in a 44-story glass tower called Park Avenue Plaza, at 55 East 52nd Street. The decision was first reported yesterday in The Daily News. 
Aon is the last of the major tenants from the World Trade Center to secure a new home. All of the major tenants have largely abandoned the historic financial district, where there are acres and acres of vacant office space.
Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, for instance, is moving its headquarters to Brooklyn, while Marsh & McLennan, the financial services conglomerate, is heading for a new waterfront tower in Hoboken, N.J., with 2,000 employees. Morgan Stanley Dean Witter and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey have scattered.
"It's always disappointing when a firm displaced by the attack decides not to return," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the Alliance for Downtown New York. "But I'm confident that as downtown becomes even better than it was before Sept. 11 we'll attract many new companies downtown."
The exodus has prompted fear among city and state officials and downtown landlords that one of the largest business districts in the country will disintegrate. Many corporations are concerned about practical transportation problems downtown, where the PATH train and some subway stations are being rebuilt, and emotional reactions to the loss of life.
Fueled with federal money, city and state officials have created a multibillion-dollar grab bag of cash incentives to entice large and small businesses to stay in Lower Manhattan or move there. 
Deloitte & Touche, Ambac Financial, Nomura Holding America, the Century 21 Department Store and 10 other companies have signed agreements pledging to remain in Lower Manhattan in return for millions of dollars in cash grants. Dozens of other companies are considering it. Tax incentives and tax-exempt bonds are also available.
A number of Midtown law firms and other professional services are considering the move downtown. "People are milling about trying to figure out what to do," one broker said. "The numbers are so compelling that any service firm is going to kick the tires downtown. But none of them has actually landed."
Some business executives have criticized the use of cash incentives for professional firms, which they say are not major job generators. They argue that the federal money should be spent on improving transportation, rather than propping up rents, major downtown landlords or companies that control vacant space.
City and state officials, however, are hoping to lure a major company like KPMG that would serve as a symbol of vitality. "There are five large companies employing over 10,000 people that are looking at downtown space right now," said Andrew M. Alper, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation. "We find that very encouraging."
KPMG has been scouring Midtown and Lower Manhattan, but real estate executives and government officials said the accounting company was serious about 1 World Financial Center. It is negotiating incentives with the city and rent with Lehman Brothers, which controls the space but has moved thousands of employees to Midtown.
"It's quite real," said one executive. "But it's not done."
KPMG was noncommittal yesterday. "We're considering all our options in Manhattan," said George Ledwith, a spokesman for KPMG, which has its headquarters at 345 Park Avenue. "That would include downtown locations."
Richards Spears Kibbe & Orbe recently completed a lease with Lehman Brothers to lease about 90,000 square feet at 1 World Financial, starting at $41 a square foot. Real estate brokers expect the net cost of the space to drop with the downtown incentives.
By contrast, Aon is completing a deal to rent 270,000 square feet at Park Avenue Plaza in Midtown for about $58 a square foot, according to real estate executives who have been briefed on the talks. The decision to move there came while Aon was negotiating a downtown incentive package with the city. 
Aon is still looking to move a smaller group of employees downtown, possibly to 55 Water Street or 75 Wall Street. But according to one executive involved in the discussions, Aon would probably not leave enough employees downtown to qualify for a cash grant. 

CORRECTION-DATE: May 24, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about efforts to keep businesses in Lower Manhattan misstated the current location of Richards Spears Kibbe & Orbe, a law firm that signed a lease for space at 1 World Financial Center. Its offices are downtown in Chase Manhattan Plaza, not in Midtown.

HEADLINE: Welfare in New York 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Re "Mayor's Welfare Plan Embraces Job Training" (front page, May 16): As Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg seems to recognize, work must be more than the fuel to power the "welfare exit" frenzy. Instead, it must be part of a larger work force development strategy that focuses on the obstacles that people face in obtaining and retaining long-term employment. 
 This may require stabilizing a homeless person in permanent housing, or dealing with issues of child care, literacy, educational deficits or just the lack of real work experience. 
And it must be in jobs that are not the most vulnerable to an economic downturn, and in jobs that pay a living wage with health benefits. 
Until we confront these real-life issues, we may continue to see drops in the welfare rolls, but poverty will continue to rise.

HEADLINE: Testing Putin On Iran 

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM SAFIRE; E-mail: safire@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
Thirteen days after Sept. 11 Russia's president, Vladimir Putin, met with 21 leaders from the Duma and the Presidium of the State Council to determine Russia's response to America's war on terror. 
 "One of the participants advocated support for the Taliban," reports Grigory Yavlinsky, head of the democratic reform party, who was present, "while 18 participants proposed that Russia remain neutral in the fight between America and the terrorists. Only two said that Russia should participate in the antiterrorist coalition." 
 Putin sided with the two, which instantly became the majority. (For Yavlinsky's idealistic vision of how this could grow into a Russian-U.S. alliance, try www.eng.yabloko.ru/) Putin then seized the opportunity to abandon long-held strategic positions without humiliation and to gain a superpower ally in Russia's inexorable rivalry with China. 
Remember last year's hand-wringing by France's Jacques Chirac and Germany's Gerhard Schroder about that cowboy Bush's insistence on a missile defense? Recall their panicky prediction that his withdrawal from the ABM treaty would surely start a new arms race? Then Bush abrogated, the Chinese hyperventilated, and Putin all but genuflected. 
Remember the horror of our accommodationists at the East-West "collision course" sure to be caused by expansion of the NATO alliance to include nations flush against Russia's borders? Strange as it seems, many members of the old Soviet Warsaw Pact have already joined, and soon the three Baltic nations will be welcomed. Putin has been pacified with regular NATO consultation.
Remember the elite derision at how (yecch!) unilateralist it sounded when Bush said he would reduce the nuclear missiles we have deployed by two-thirds no matter what the Russians did? In Moscow this weekend, Putin will blandly go along with that cut, and in return for codifying both in a three-page treaty will not object to our keeping undeployed nukes in our attic. 
Ordinarily, these happy developments would cause a paroxysm of gloating by hard-liners, but we are denied our deserved nyah-nyahing by the same device Putin used on his score of Russian naysayers: Sept. 11 reshuffled the deck. Diplomatic circumstances changed, and so mistaken predictions cannot be held against the muddled multilateralists. 
No longer does Putin fear humiliation if he gives way on armaments he cannot afford. Russian pride was salved by the injury inflicted on the U.S. and our need for intelligence help in the terror war, as well as public buttering-up by an avidly trusting Bush. Putin's "turn to the West" -- more to the U.S. than Europe -- does not seriously undermine his popularity at home.
After welcoming Bush to Russia tomorrow and following the usual signing, embracing and cold-war-is-over effusion, the Russian will get to the point: His nation needs capital investment as well as entry into the World Trade Organization. 
We know his population is down to half the U.S. size and his economy is half as big as that of Portugal, the poorest country in Europe. But Putin will remind us he is sitting on the world's largest oil and gas reserves, which could break the OPEC cartel. 
Bush, one hopes, will stress the need for sanctity of contracts and the end of wholesale bribery to attract investors. He should tell Putin his stranglehold on the mass media makes a mockery of political freedom, and point out that a war on terror is not a free pass to continue to brutalize Chechen civilians.
Then to the big one. For a whopping fee, Russia is helping Iran construct a 1,000-megawatt nuclear reactor at Bushehr (a name George W. can easily remember) with a uranium conversion facility able to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons. 
At the same time, hundreds of Russian technicians are helping Iran develop the Shahab-4 missile, range over 1,250 miles, to carry a nuclear or germ warhead anywhere in the Middle East and into Europe. 
Iran's terrorist arm is Hezbollah. If its agents are armed with a weapon of mass destruction, and if that weapon is used against the U.S. (and our defeatist F.B.I. director tells us to get used to it), then we would have to retaliate against the terrorists' sponsors and suppliers. Thus for Russia to help Iran empower Hezbollah is hugely detrimental to Russia's interests. 
Bush should make clear it would be the end of a beautiful friendship.

Columbia University's President Is Moving On, Along With His Graduates

 BODY:
Columbia University's commencement ceremony yesterday was an important moment not only for about 10,000 students, but also for several top Columbia officials, including its departing president, George Rupp, and its incoming president, Lee C. Bollinger. 
 Although Dr. Rupp will not officially leave his post until June 1, the president, looking relaxed and sunburned, seemed both reflective and excited about moving on. And in his address to the graduates, he talked of the challenges he and the new graduates would face together, after their "shared commencement." 
 One critical challenge, he said, was globalization. While it is a way to extend the reach of the Western world, he said, "it also means that the hatred and violence nurtured by envy and exclusion and ideologically laden differences anywhere in the world are very near to us." 
"Our destiny cannot be divorced from the fate of the rest of the world, including those furthest from us in geography, ideology and socioeconomic status," he declared. "The United States may be the world's lone superpower. But we cannot simply impose our will, even on those who seem relatively powerless." 
Dr. Rupp also used the occasion to criticize America's sometimes isolationist tendencies, especially before Sept. 11. He said that even after the increase in foreign economic assistance recently promised by President George W. Bush, the United States will still be giving only 15 cents out of every $100,000 of its gross domestic product. "As a fraction of the total economy, that will be one seventh as much as Denmark gives now," he said. 
These are issues that he will undoubtedly return to in his next post, as president of the International Rescue Committee, the refugee relief agency. 
Columbia officials said the crowd that squeezed into the university's central quadrangle was the largest ever at a Columbia graduation ceremony, with about 10,000 graduates, a record, and more than 30,000 guests, also a record. 
There were so many graduates, that Columbia seated graduates from Teachers College on the stage and on the stairway behind the stage.
Security at the two-hour ceremony was heavier than usual but barely visible. And in a year of international turmoil and protest, there was little sign of either among the graduates, whose diversity was apparent despite their shared blue graduation robes. 
A few graduates wore kaffiyehs or kente cloth around their necks; others wore yarmulkes; one man had a turban on his head in place of the standard mortarboard; a young woman whose head was swathed in a scarf perched her graduation hat on top of the scarf. 
When Dr. Rupp referred to the death and destruction of Sept. 11, the huge crowd suddenly fell silent. But otherwise the mood was celebratory. 
Dr. Rupp said that he had not attended his own graduation ceremony from Harvard when he received his Ph.D. -- "that's the way it was then" -- but noted that such rituals are back in fashion. 
Mr. Bollinger said that he, too, had skipped the graduation ceremony when he received a law degree from Columbia. But he and his wife, Jean, were cheering happily when their daughter Carey rose with the other Columbia Law School graduates when their diplomas were granted yesterday. "It's an era when people can enjoy these ceremonies in a meaningful way," he said.
Mr. Bollinger, too, received a degree yesterday; Columbia gave him an honorary doctor of laws degree. The university also awarded honorary degrees to Joan Didion, the writer; George J. Mitchell, the diplomat and former senator; Ruth J. Simmons, the president of Brown University; Roberto Gonzalez Echevarria, a writer, critic and professor; Jack Beeson, a composer and teacher; and Brenda Milner, a science researcher.

HEADLINE: Russia's Compass Points West 

 BODY:
Ever since Peter the Great looked to Europe in the late 17th century as a model for modernizing Russia, the integration of Russia and the West has been an alluring but unfulfilled dream. This week, as President Bush visits Moscow and St. Petersburg, the splendid city by the Baltic that Peter founded, he can bring that dream closer to realization. Building on the political and economic changes that have rolled across Europe since the cold war ended, Mr. Bush and President Vladimir Putin of Russia have brought Russia to Europe's doorstep. With further work, they can guide it across the threshold. 
 The events of Sept. 11 united Washington and Moscow in new ways, and Mr. Putin's supportive call to Mr. Bush just hours after the terror attacks helped seal the friendship that was developing between them. The nuclear arms reduction accord that the two leaders will sign in Moscow, followed a few days later in Italy by the confirmation of a new relationship between Russia and NATO, are the most tangible symbols of a growing partnership. Underlying these achievements are powerful historical forces that have drawn East and West together since the demise of Communism and the collapse of the Soviet empire. 
 It has not always been a pretty process. The introduction of democracy and free markets to Russia after 1,000 years of tyranny has produced painful economic and social dislocation. The sudden contraction of Russia's military power and global reach has left the nation stunned. Even now, vestiges of Russia's historic ambition can be seen in Moscow's nuclear assistance to Iran, its misbegotten romance with Saddam Hussein and lingering bitterness over NATO's war with Yugoslavia three years ago. Yet through these years of turbulence, Russia under Boris Yeltsin and Mr. Putin has been drawn westward by the gravitational pull of trade, financial markets and democracy.
As Russia and the West converge, Washington and Moscow are approaching a state of nearly normal relations, free of the high drama -- and disappointments -- that so often marked cold-war summit meetings. Once the arms treaty is signed, committing the nations to cut their arsenals of long-range nuclear weapons by two-thirds by 2012, Mr. Bush and Mr. Putin will have to turn to the tough business of controlling the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, combating terrorism and enhancing economic cooperation. 
For Mr. Putin, that means setting aside longstanding secrecy about the Soviet Union's elaborate biological weapons program so that Moscow and Washington can work together to inventory, secure and ultimately destroy remaining armaments and the germ labs used to make them. Mr. Bush, for his part, must not shrink from publicly distinguishing between a carefully managed battle against terrorism, like the war in Afghanistan, and Moscow's brutish military campaign to suppress Chechen separatists. Mr. Bush should also speak up on behalf of a free press and the rule of law, principles that Mr. Putin has often been quick to bulldoze. 
Fully integrating Russia with the West will take years, and a great deal of skillful diplomacy by American, European and Russian leaders. Strong-arming Russia will not work, and a disdain for international treaties, like Mr. Bush's renunciation of the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, will not help. But with enlightened leadership on all sides, the visit of an American president to Moscow may someday seem little different from a stop in Paris or Berlin.

HEADLINE: As Bush Heads for Russia, Hopes for an Investment Plan Fade 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WINES

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 22 

 BODY:
With President Bush barely a day away from Moscow, it began to appear today that he would not be bringing with him economic proposals to transform his first Kremlin meeting with President Vladimir V. Putin into anything more than a funeral service for the cold war.
 In Moscow, that was a clear disappointment for those who have held out hope that Mr. Bush might use such proposals to signal that talk of a new Russian-American alliance will yield tangible riches soon. 
 The Russian government said today that negotiators for both sides had put the final flourishes on the centerpiece of the meeting, an agreement to reduce each side's nuclear stockpiles by two-thirds or more. 
The two presidents are also to sign a nonbinding agreement setting out a new framework for bilateral relations. 
And the Kremlin indicated that it would sign three other agreements dealing with cooperation against terrorism, stabilizing world energy supplies and expanding cultural and governmental contacts.
But none of the announcements mentioned what some Russians were seeking as much as any arms-control accord: an increase in investments, economic incentives or other policy changes that would help stimulate the Russian economy.
A spokesman for Commerce Secretary Donald L. Evans, who is in Moscow for the three-day meeting, said he knew of no plans to sign any such economic agreements.
More galling to some officials -- though expected -- was the word that Mr. Bush would not bring promises of action on the two economic issues of greatest concern to them: the repeal of the Jackson-Vanik amendment and American certification of Russia as a market economy.
The Jackson-Vanik amendment, aimed squarely at cold war restrictions on the movement of Soviet Jews, bars the president from giving favorable tariff treatment to nations that restrict free emigration. Congress has routinely waived the ban for Russia during the last decade, but Russian officials see its permanent abolition as a symbol that the United States recognizes Russia's transition toward democracy.
Mr. Bush supports lifting the ban, but legislation to do so sits today in a committee of the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, with no clear date for further action in sight.
One Congressional official said that the amendment was snarled in an unrelated legislative dispute over American textiles.
"There were some missteps on the administration's part," the official said. "They just couldn't get it through the House, and they thought they had a tough road in the Senate."
The United States has also held out hope of Russia's gaining the legal status of a free-market economy, which would entitle it to an array of benefits in trade with the United States.
But a Commerce Department officer said today that the quasijudicial process leading to that decision was only now completing the period of public debate, with the United States Import Administration still to conduct deliberations of unknown length.
Russia must meet six standards to win market-economy status, and on some -- like the degree to which the government controls the allocation of natural resources -- the country's compliance may be an open question.
Officially, the Russian government has played down the delays in both procedures, saying that the White House's commitment is a clear signal of American trust even if real benefits have not yet materialized.
And, stymied economic hopes aside, there are the week's negotiated accomplishments, of which the so-called framework agreement for bilateral relations is the most important. It makes what the Kremlin called a "politically binding" declaration that the two nations will not aim military actions at each other and will seek to cooperate on foreign policy and economic issues.
A senior American official said tonight that the agreement would also take the first steps toward American-Russian cooperation on a limited defense against ballistic missiles.
The United States announced in December that it was withdrawing from the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, the foundation of most arms-control accords, so that it could begin developing such a defense. Russia continues to argue that the withdrawal is a serious mistake.
The senior official said the framework agreement would commit both sides to set up a long-discussed center to exchange data on missile launchings and tests.

HEADLINE: Senate Panel Votes to Include More People in Sept. 11 Relief 

BYLINE:  By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22 

 BODY:
A Senate panel approved a measure today that would expand the number of New Yorkers eligible for emergency housing aid as a result of the attack on the World Trade Center.
 The action was in response to reports that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had denied thousands of needy families the financial aid they needed to avoid eviction from their apartments or foreclosure of their homes. 
 The agency has acknowledged that one reason for the denials is that agency officials decided to limit such benefits to individuals who could prove that any income they lost was a "direct result" of the Sept. 11 attack. The agency limited such aid to people working south of Canal Street, officials said. 
The emergency housing measure was included in a $31 billion emergency spending bill that the Senate Appropriations Committee approved unanimously this afternoon, Senate staff members said.
Even though some officials say the agency has moved to correct the problem, the housing measure was inserted in the spending bill at the urging of New York's senior senator, Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat.
"FEMA's policy was so narrowly construed that thousands of New Yorkers who were economically devastated by the attacks on Sept. 11 were denied the help they deserved and help they desperately needed," Mr. Schumer said. "That never should have happened," he continued, "and our new provision directing FEMA to expand its definition of those eligible for mortgage and rental assistance should make sure it never happens again."
The House Appropriations Committee did not include any such housing provision in the emergency spending bill it approved earlier this month. But it is unlikely that House leaders will oppose the housing provision, since the money to finance it will come from a $21.5 billion disaster aid package that President Bush agreed to provide New York after the attack, Senate aides said.
The housing provision requires the federal agency to provide mortgage and rental assistance to anyone whose earnings were hurt by the attack, provided that person works in Manhattan or earns 75 percent of his or her wages from business conducted in Manhattan.
The applicant would have to have received a late notice or an eviction or foreclosure notice. The provisions would also reimburse applicants who were mistakenly turned away, providing them with assistance to cover their mortgage or rent payments from the time their initial application should have been approved.
The agency has acknowledged that some 15,000 people got faulty aid applications that increased the chances that they would be denied assistance. Hundreds of others were turned down because their claims were judged under outdated eligibility requirements, officials said.
Since December, Congress has appropriated roughly $10 billion to the agency to respond to the physical and economic impact of the attacks.
The emergency spending package approved today provides an additional $5.5 billion as part of the $21.5 billion in disaster relief aid that President Bush pledged to New York. It includes $90 million for periodic health screenings of workers and volunteers at ground zero, money that Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton sought.
Government officials have estimated that people in the New York disaster region lost about 75,000 jobs and $4.5 billion in income.
As of late last month, FEMA had provided less than $65 million to help economically distressed people. That is only a fraction of the amounts the agency distributed in the months after other major catastrophes.

HEADLINE: Cuba's Other Face 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 President Bush is simply wrong in saying Fidel Castro's revolution "has brought Cuba's workers and farmers and families nothing -- nothing -- but isolation and misery" ("Embargo Remains Until Cuba Alters Policy, Bush Says," front page, May 21). 
 According to the United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America, Cuba maintains the lowest level of infant mortality and the third lowest level of illiteracy in Latin America despite the overwhelming pressure of the United States embargo. 
A realistic approach to Cuba by the United States must begin by acknowledging the Castro government's undeniable achievements as well as its widely acknowledged shortcomings.

HEADLINE: Security Council Tries to Ease Tensions Between U.S. and Iraq 

BYLINE:  By SOMINI SENGUPTA

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, May 22 

 BODY:
Diplomats on the Security Council, even including the United States' European allies, are working quietly but persistently to head off American military action against Iraq by trying to persuade Saddam Hussein's government to reopen the country to arms inspectors. 
 Privately, the diplomats say they are constantly and keenly aware of the threat of American military action, which one diplomat described as hanging like a sword of Damocles over their discussions. A failure to persuade the Iraqis to allow the inspectors back in, they say, would only strengthen the hand of those within the Bush administration who favor war, led by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld. 
 The United States is alone among the 15 Security Council members in leaning toward a military route. Many believe that if Iraq once again allows inspections it may create a substantial diplomatic obstacle between Bush administration hawks and an Iraqi invasion. At the same time, they say, it may also exploit divisions within the Bush administration and bolster those, like Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, who favor diplomacy. 
"The move is to help Colin Powell over Rumsfeld," said one European diplomat on the council. "Maybe we are wrong. But the idea is that if you deploy hundreds of inspectors throughout Iraq and they do a good job, and they are not prevented from doing a good job by the Iraqi authorities -- so there are a number of ifs -- then it will be very difficult for the Pentagon to justify that military action is justified and the choice will be in hands of President Bush."
The inspectors are charged with the task of making sure that Iraq is stripped of weapons of mass destruction, which the Bush administration fears Baghdad could pass to terrorist groups. The Bush administration appears willing to invade Iraq to guarantee that cannot happen. 
The inspectors left in December 1998, on the eve of American and British airstrikes, after years of stonewalling and standoffs by Iraqi officials. Their return now, diplomats hope, would make an American assault unnecessary. It is in any case a precondition for lifting the economic sanctions that Iraq has lived under since it invaded Kuwait in 1990. 
The Council members recently agreed to modify those sanctions, in a step that the United States hoped would increase pressure on Mr. Hussein to live up to his obligations by making it harder for him to claim that ordinary Iraqis are being unduly punished by the sanctions. 
The optimism of some Security Council members notwithstanding, it is impossible to predict whether Iraq is ready to let the monitors return. For the moment, however, the goal, is "unity of the Council," as diplomats say. "The more the Security Council remains united on forcing Iraq to fulfill its obligations completely in accordance with Security Council resolutions," said another European official, "the more the hands of the doves are strengthened in Washington." 
For their part, senior American officials say they will in the meantime continue to operate on two tracks. On one track, they will use international pressure, diplomacy and the sanctions, to tighten the noose on Baghdad. On the other, they will keep alive the military option to topple Mr. Hussein.
"Not everyone agrees with us on the concept of a regime change," one American official here conceded. "But we're working on that."

HEADLINE: Cuomo Decision Roils Party's Convention 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

 BODY:
New York Democrats tried yesterday to generate some excitement for their party and the coming election, but Andrew M. Cuomo's decision to skip the party's convention threw a long shadow over the political theatrics. 
 Party leaders had drafted James Carville, the colorful speaker and former campaign strategist for President Bill Clinton, to inspire the 353 delegates and hundreds of elected officials who came to the Sheraton New York Hotel in Manhattan for a gathering whose outcome was largely preordained. 
 Mr. Cuomo's announcement yesterday that he would stay away and attempt to gather enough signatures on petitions to gain a spot on the ballot threw his supporters at the convention into confusion and robbed the two-day event of what little drama it had: the fight between Mr. Cuomo, a former federal housing secretary, and the state comptroller, H. Carl McCall. 
Mr. McCall had locked up the support of a majority of the delegates, but it was unclear whether Mr. Cuomo had the 25 percent he needed to win a place on the primary ballot. Many delegates, including some Cuomo supporters, said they were offended by Mr. Cuomo's decision to back out.
"I didn't like it," said Andrea Paternoster, a bank officer from Delaware County who supports Mr. Cuomo. "I understand it's a calculated risk he's taking, but people have worked for him, have supported him, and he's walking away from them."
Mr. McCall and his supporters crowed about Mr. Cuomo's decision, calling it a sign of the weakness of the Cuomo campaign.
Delegates seemed divided about the effect of Mr. Cuomo's decision. Many speculated that it would reinforce his effort to portray himself as an outsider running against the Democratic machine, even though he is the son of a former governor and has worked in government posts for many years. Other delegates scoffed at the notion that Mr. Cuomo could succeed in trying to run as a outsider. "I don't believe it passes the laugh test," said Assemblywoman Susan John of Rochester. "He's the son of the former governor. His father once ran the party."
Mr. Carville arrived from Washington in the midst of this confusion to deliver a stemwinder to fire up the rank-and-file party members. While a band played Dixieland, Mr. Carville, wearing sunglasses, took the stage, rolled up his sleeves and proceeded to denigrate Gov. George E. Pataki as beholden to powerful business interests. 
In his Louisiana accent, Mr. Carville blamed the governor for rising auto insurance rates, failing dairy farms, high electricity costs, rising local taxes, the shrinking upstate economy and low student test scores. He also attacked the governor's record of increasing state debt and failing to finance a program that cleans up toxic waste sites. 
"He has accumulated, not a record to run on, but a record to run from," Mr. Carville said as the delegates, who had been lethargic through most of the speeches, applauded loudly.
Michael McKeon, the governor's spokesman, dismissed Mr. Carville's remarks as a partisan attack. "I don't think the raging Cajun knows the governor's record in New York," Mr. McKeon said, using Mr. Carville's nickname. 
Mr. Carville also tried to remind the audience of what he saw as the party's bedrock principle: that government can serve to protect the average citizen from powerful and rapacious business interests. He tried to portray Mr. Pataki as a man who put his own political advancement and the interests of business above those of average people.
He also urged New York Democrats to set aside petty grievances within the party and concentrate on the election. "Stop the whining and let's start the winning right now," he said. 
Mr. Carville's speech was the high point of a day of tedious addresses that left some officials yawning. 
The party unanimously nominated Eliot L. Spitzer, the attorney general, to run for re-election. Mr. Spitzer faced no opposition among Democrats after having acquired a national reputation in the last four years with a string of publicized lawsuits. Most recently he forced Merrill Lynch to pay a $100 million fine for advising people to buy stock in companies with which it had provided investment banking services. 
"What a difference four years makes," Mr. Spitzer said as he came to the podium to loud applause. In 1998, he had struggled to gain support from the party.
The designation of Mr. Spitzer came after other party leaders laid out the themes of the offensive against Mr. Pataki, a moderate Republican who has taken up many traditionally Democratic issues, like health care for the poor, and made them his own. The governor is a formidable opponent and extremely popular among voters, including Democrats, according to polls. He also has about $16 million in campaign funds. 
Sheldon Silver, the Manhattan Democrat who is the speaker of the State Assembly, said Mr. Pataki was now claiming credit for programs that the Democrats developed and that he initially resisted, like health insurance for poor children and their parents. "It's time to send this make-believe Democrat packing," Mr. Silver said. 
Mr. Cuomo's sudden absence seemed to dominate the largely ceremonial proceedings yesterday. The delegates and elected leaders jostled in the hallways of the hotel, trading theories about what it meant and whether it was a smart move. Some speculated that Mr. Cuomo might have lacked enough votes to force a primary. Some said Mr. Cuomo risked alienating the party workers he would need if he makes it to the fall election. Others said it was a clever tactic and would upstage Mr. McCall. 
Rather than the convention becoming a two-day celebration of Mr. McCall's crushing victory over Mr. Cuomo, it becomes a more humdrum affair. Mr. Cuomo will be able to claim to be a maverick trying, as he said yesterday, "to change the culture of Albany."
"There is a big risk," said Stuart Brody, the Essex County party chairman, who supports Mr. Cuomo. "But there is also a big reward. A lot of Democrats feel that the party has not been as effective as it could be and should be in connecting to our constituencies."

HEADLINE: White House Acknowledges More Contacts With Enron 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22 

 BODY:
White House officials had more extensive contacts with Enron executives in 2001 than previously disclosed, according to a document released by the Bush administration today in response to a request for information from a Senate committee.
 The document describes contacts -- including meetings, phone conversations, letters and e-mail messages -- that concerned the national energy policy report produced by Vice President Dick Cheney, the California energy crisis, Enron's collapse last fall and appointments to administration posts, including the head of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
 The White House document also disclosed that Enron executives, including Kenneth L. Lay, the former chairman, attended numerous White House functions, including the 2001 inaugural, the Easter Egg roll, T-ball games, speeches and social events.
The release of the information came hours after a deeply divided Senate panel voted to issue two subpoenas to the White House for information about contacts with Enron, with Democrats accusing the White House of resisting earlier requests for information and Republicans suggesting that the move was politically motivated.
The White House document released today was prepared in response to an earlier request for information from the Governmental Affairs Committee, whose chairman is Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, the former Democratic vice presidential nominee. While it came after the subpoena was issued, it was not a legal response to it. 
Aides to Mr. Lieberman said tonight that after a brief review of the document, the panel regards it as short of the information being sought. "It appears the White House is still providing only what it thinks is relevant, rather than what the committee asked for," said Leslie Phillips, a spokeswoman for the committee. "We just don't know if the information is everything they collected, or just what they're willing to tell us. This would not have in any way averted a subpoena."
Before the White House document was released, a spokeswoman said administration officials were "rather perplexed" that the panel had "taken this highly unusual step to issue subpoenas without having reviewed" the material. 
The vote in the Governmental Affairs Committee this morning was 9 to 8 along party lines to issue the subpoenas. It came after more than an hour's debate that included a heated exchange between Mr. Lieberman and Senator Thad Cochran, Republican of Mississippi.
The subpoenas were the first issued by Congress to the executive branch in the continuing inquiry into Enron's collapse and are likely to be resisted by the White House, which has often complained that Congress is encroaching on its executive power and constitutional prerogatives.
In another battle with Congress over the same kind of issue, the Justice Department sought today to dismiss a lawsuit filed by the General Accounting Office seeking to obtain records of meetings last year between energy industry executives and Mr. Cheney's energy task force.
The Justice Department's motion in federal district court here argues that the G.A.O. is trying to "improperly inject itself and the courts into the president's exercise of his powers." The G.A.O.'s position, the Justice Department said, "would revolutionize and violate the separation of powers doctrine that has made our nation's government so strong."
A spokesman for the G.A.O. declined to comment, citing the pending litigation.
In another development related to Enron today, many of the nation's largest energy traders told FERC that they did not engage in the manipulative trading tactics in California outlined in internal Enron memorandums released by the commission this month. But several of the companies, including Williams and Mirant, said some trades had similar characteristics to those outlined in the memos. The companies maintained, though, that the trades had been made under different circumstances or adhered to market rules.
The traders made filings today at the energy regulatory commission in response to a demand from investigators examining accusations of manipulation during the California power crisis of 2000-01. Today, the commission widened its investigation again, ordering natural gas traders in Texas and Western states to disclose whether they engaged in fake "wash trades," selling gas back and forth at the same price. Such trades do not incur losses or profits, but allow traders to claim inflated revenue. Investigators are examining whether wash trades also allowed traders to increase reported prices for gas and electricity, thus affecting prices for the entire market.
The subpoenas, delivered this afternoon to the offices of the president and vice president, call for all communications, including records of White House visits, between Enron and the White House since 1992 that in any way deal with eight federal agencies including the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the Securities and Exchange Commission. In addition, they seek records of contacts between the White House and officials at the eight agencies regarding Enron. They also seek records of contacts between Enron and the White House over the formulation of the national energy policy, covering similar ground as the G.A.O. except that the accounting office is also seeking records of contacts with other energy companies.
The subpoenas demand that information be turned over by June 5. The White House called the action unnecessary today but did not say whether it would contest the subpoenas.
Democrats on the committee said the White House had been dragging its feet for the nearly two months since the panel sent its first letter seeking the Enron-related information. "It's clear to me that there is a very determined decision not to respond to substantial parts of the committee's request for information," Mr. Lieberman said. "At the least, it's slow walking; at the worst, it's stonewalling."
But Republicans, led by Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee, the ranking minority member of the committee, called the move premature and said there was no reason to burden the White House with a subpoena when the administration was preoccupied with the war against terrorism and even Democrats on the panel agreed there had been no suggestion of White House wrongdoing related to Enron's collapse.
The debate in the committee intensified after Mr. Cochran suggested that the subpoenas were a politically motivated fishing expedition intended to smear the White House.
"It makes me wonder, are we doing this to attract the attention of the public by suggesting" that the White House has some involvement? Mr. Cochran said. "It makes me very suspicious," he said, adding that the panel was seeking so much information from the White House that "if you got everything you asked for, you wouldn't know what to do with it."
In a sharp voice, Mr. Lieberman quickly responded to the "personal" criticism, telling Mr. Cochran, "Your suspicions are unwarranted, and in my opinion unfair."
In a letter tonight to Mr. Lieberman, the White House counsel, Alberto R. Gonzales, referring to the president's office, said, "Our inquiries thus far have disclosed no instance in which Enron approached any person within the E.O.P. or the office of the vice president seeking help in connection with its financial difficulties prior to bankruptcy."
"In addition," Mr. Gonzales said, "the communications we have identified thus far reflect only appropriate and responsible actions by government officials."
The seven-page document, released by the White House this evening, illustrates how Enron officials approached many people in the Bush administration with specific requests or to discuss specific topics, like electricity policies, tax credits for wind power, the California energy crisis, and legislation governing power-plant pollutants. It also shows that Mr. Lay recommended 21 people for jobs in the administration, though only 3 ultimately received appointments.
The document lists at least 19 meetings between White House and Enron officials -- including five meetings with Vice President Cheney's energy task force -- and at least a half-dozen phone calls. The actual number cannot be determined, as contacts with some White House officials are described as "a few communications" or as a "small number of telephone calls."
The information includes a number of contacts already disclosed, like a a half-hour meeting on April 17, 2001, between Mr. Lay and Mr. Cheney to talk about "energy policy and the energy crisis in California."
It also lists phone calls that Mr. Lay made to Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief political adviser, and another administration official, urging the appointments of Patrick Wood III and Nora Brownell to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Both were eventually appointed, though in several crucial matters they have backed policies that Enron fought hard to defeat.
The document also notes calls Mr. Lay made to senior administration officials seeking assistance as Enron was collapsing late last year, and it details the debate in the administration about the company's problems. The White House has always said it did not do anything to intervene on Enron's behalf.
But the information released tonight does disclose at least a dozen new meetings or phone calls related to energy policy or issues of significant importance to Enron, mostly with three White House officials: Robert McNally, a special assistant to the president for economic policy, whose name had not been previously disclosed by the administration as having any contact with Enron; Lawrence B. Lindsey, the chairman of the National Economic Council; and Steve Ruhlen, deputy assistant to the vice president for legislative affairs.
For example, it says, "Dr. Lindsey had a few communications with Ken Lay in the winter and spring of 2001, most likely about the California electricity shortage."
At the time, Enron was aggressively fighting efforts to impose limits on soaring power prices in California. Administration officials came out against the price caps, but President Bush's two appointees to FERC, Mr. Wood and Ms. Brownell, supported a move last summer to impose price limits across the western United States that California officials credit with helping bring prices under control.
On April 6, 2001, Mr. Lindsey also attended a meeting with Mr. Lay, Mr. McNally and several other Enron and White House officials to discuss "electricity and bundling issues," the latter a reference to aspects of electricity deregulation. "Mr. Lay also talked to Dr. Lindsey after the September 11 attacks to state that confidence and investment plans were deteriorating in the wake of the attacks." The White House said Enron did not ask Mr. Lindsey for help as it collapsed last fall.
Without elaborating, the document also says that Mr. Lindsey "may have mentioned Enron in passing in explaining an economic concept relating to the electricity grid" during a meeting with Andrew H. Card Jr., the White House chief of staff. The rules governing the nation's electricity were a crucial policy issue for Enron, which sought to have the federal government wrest more control of the grid away from state utility commissions.
Mr. McNally appeared to have had even more contact with Enron officials, including seven meetings in 2001. "The main issues discussed in these communications were multi-emissions policy (Enron supported four-pollutant legislation on power plants) and electricity policy," the White House document said. Of the seven meetings, one, which included the director of the energy task force, had already been disclosed, and another was the April 6 meeting that also included Mr. Lindsey.
In the months before the energy policy report was released last May, Mr. Ruhlen "received a small number of telephone calls" from Pat Shortridge, whom the White House identified as an Enron governmental affairs official and personal friend of Mr. Ruhlen. 
In the calls, Mr. Shortridge was seeking "information concerning the likely components of the president's energy plan." The calls were similar to others Mr. Ruhlen had with other energy executives, and in them he "disclaimed knowledge" of details of the plan, the White House said.

HEADLINE: PHOTOGRAPHY REVIEW; 
Little Ones, Are You Haves or Have-Nots?

BYLINE:  By GRACE GLUECK 

 BODY:
Around the turn of the century, there was Lewis Hine (1874-1940), who photographed children toiling in mills and factories. And then there were the Pictorialists, led by Alfred Stieglitz (1864-1946), who took charming, romantic pictures of children in the toils of middle-class privilege. Which children were really better off? This is one of the questions raised by an insightful show with a cumbersome title, "Priceless Children: American Photographs 1890-1925 -- Child Labor and the Pictorialist Ideal," at the Grey Art Gallery of New York University.
 The show was organized by the Weatherspoon Art Museum of Greensboro, N.C., with George Dimock, associate professor of art history at the University of North Carolina, serving as curator. In some 138 vintage black-and-white prints, it juxtaposes for the first time Hines's sociological approach to photography with that of the aesthetically oriented Pictorialists (who also included Gertrude Kasebier, Fred Holland Day, Clarence White, Edward Weston and Edward Steichen). 
 Although it seems self-evident that the children who worked in factories were worse off than those brought up in sheltered circumstances, it was not necessarily so, Mr. Dimock writes in his catalog essay. The working-class children "often embody a freedom, exuberance, sociability and autonomy that their more privileged and closely guarded peers might well have envied," he says. 
On the other hand, the bourgeois home was not always "a safe haven in a heartless world," he points out. In some cases it could be a fragile, vulnerable shelter with "a claustrophobic sense of isolation." In others, the Pictorialist image blandly covered up the pain of its subjects.
In any case, Hine and the Pictorialists (or Photo-Secessionists, as the group styled itself) produced remarkable photographs of children at a time when perceptions were changing: from the traditional agrarian view of a child as a contributing worker in a family to a modern urban regard for the young as economically useless but emotionally "priceless" individuals.
Still, in the period this show covers, child labor was considered by many to be a useful contribution to the capitalist system and even beneficial for the child. But as an employee of the National Child Labor Committee and an ardent subscriber to its progressive beliefs, Hine was out to do away with it.
In his work with the committee, from 1907 to 1918, he traveled tens of thousands of miles and took some 5,000 photographs of what he considered exploited children and their families. At each shoot, he made notes, like this one in 1908 for a superb portrait of a grim-looking cotton mill employee in South Carolina looking defiantly at the camera: "A typical cotton mill boy. 12 years old -- one year in mill. Weaver -- 4 looms. Got 40 cents at start -- 60 cents now. Brother and Pa in mills."
Sometimes, to be sure, the notes were judgmental of his subjects as well as their working conditions. "She chews snuff," he observed of a mother who worked with her two boys in a Georgia mill. And for a photo at a glass factory in West Virginia that showed employees tranquilly polishing and wrapping bottle stoppers, he noted, "Morals in glass factory are proverbially bad." 
Hine, born in Oshkosh, Wis., began his career as a science and geography teacher at the high-minded Ethical Culture School in New York. He took up photography around 1903 with an eye to its use as an educational tool. At the school's suggestion, he photographed his now famous series of immigrants at Ellis Island so that his elite students could connect them with the immigrant Pilgrims. He mastered photography sufficiently to teach it as an art at the school, where he insisted that students observe the principles of old master composition.
In 1908 he was hired by the committee, which wanted visual data from a "broad sociological outlook" to document its fight for enforceable child labor laws. Although most of Hine's photographs -- many made under less than ideal conditions -- took account of this, he considered aesthetic matters, too, and some of these images have great artistic as well as documentary merit.
Among them is a famous 1908 shot of a wide-eyed spinner in a North Carolina cotton mill standing beside her formidable machinery in a ruffled skirt and blouse, her hair in pigtails, looking directly at the camera in a not-to-be-fooled-with gaze. She was 51 inches tall, Hine noted. Another, from 1910, depicts a 14-year-old Postal Telegraph messenger in uniform with his bicycle in Wilmington, Del., posed before a photogenic car. "Works from 7 a.m. to 6 p.m.," noted Hine. "$4 weekly. Visits houses of prostitution. Smokes."
While Hine was making his earnest rounds, the Photo-Secession artists busied themselves with fine art photography that was poetic and metaphorical in its concerns. Aspiring to the work of painters and printmakers, they thought of composition, subject matter and even print surface in "artistic" and spiritual rather than documentary terms.
Their photographs projected a romantic, idealized view of childhood, with subjects drawn mostly from their own families or those of friends. The children were usually portrayed as happy, well-kempt and cherished, or as symbols of something else.
A model Pictorialist was Kasebier (1852-1934), whose famous 1899 confection "Blessed Art Thou Among Women" shows a mother and her young daughter in a pose that Mr. Dimock calls "the quintessential distillation of the 'priceless' child." The girl, docile and expensively dressed, stands in a doorway with her white-gowned mother, whose arm encircles the child in loving togetherness. 
Even more distant from the work of Hine is that of perhaps the most idealistic and symbolically oriented of the Pictorialists, Fred Holland Day (1864-1933). A wealthy Bostonian influenced by artists like Oscar Wilde and Aubrey Beardsley, he posed his subjects in exotic ways and elaborate costumes using themes from literature, drama and religion. One of his proteges and frequent subjects was an impoverished Syrian immigrant, Khalil Gibran, later to become famous as the author of "The Prophet." The 15-year-old Gibran is shown here in an arty high-contrast portrait of 1898, picturesquely garbed as an Arabian.
Clarence White (1871-1925) made many idealized photos of attractive children and their families, including his own. Several here are from an extended portrait series of 50 family images commissioned in 1904 by Stephen and Jessica Reynolds of Terre Haute, Ind., part of a circle of progressive thinkers toward which White gravitated.
The portfolio was meant not just as a family record but also as a utopian portrayal of family harmony. One of the photos here depicts a tender moment in family life: Jessica gazing affectionately at her daughter, Jean, as the adolescent girl lies on her bed in a dreamy state, the kind of emotional encounter that Hine would shun.
But later, as a young woman, Mr. Dimock notes, Jean committed suicide, one of several bad endings he recounts in the saga of these "privileged" children. His overall point is that both Hine and the Pictorialists portrayed children in stereotypical ways, Hine by dealing with them as victims in need of rescue, the Pictorialists by viewing them through a romantic scrim. 
Some editing would help here. The Hine images by and large are small and somewhat repetitive, and the Pictorialists' work is not arranged to offset them with clarity. Still, the show is absorbing, made the more so by its thoughtful thesis.

"Priceless Children: American Photographs 1890-1925 -- Child Labor and the Pictorialist Ideal" is at Grey Art Gallery, New York University, 100 Washington Square East, Greenwich Village, through July 13.

HEADLINE: Guthrie Theater Plans Are Imperiled by Veto 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN KINZER 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 23 

 BODY:
By vetoing $24 million to build a new home for the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota has made that theater the latest victim of a wave of state and local budget cuts that are reducing arts programs across the United States.
 The new Guthrie complex was envisioned as a cultural center for the upper Midwest, with three stages and several classrooms. The architect Jean Nouvel had already drawn up design plans for the project. 
 Mr. Ventura cut $377 million from a $979.1 million bond issue approved by the Minnesota legislature. The Guthrie "brings in a lot of money; it adds fabric to our community," he told The Minneapolis Star Tribune, but said that the state could not afford the $24 million. He also vetoed $9.5 million for a new planetarium in Minneapolis, $8.2 million for the Minnesota Zoo and $5 million for the Minneapolis Children's Theater.
Advocates for the Guthrie argued that the theater had outgrown its 40-year-old building and needed a new one to maintain its position as one of the country's leading regional theaters. But on a radio program on Monday in which Governor Ventura emphasized the state's fiscal problems, he asked, "Is government in the theater business?" He added: "What was wrong with the old theater? Seems fine to me."
After years of steady expansion, public financing for the arts has begun to drop substantially as a long economic boom ends. Gov. Gray Davis of California, who is facing a multibillion-dollar budget gap, has proposed cutting the California Arts Council's budget by nearly half, to $18 million from $32 million, for the fiscal year that begins July 1. Nationally prominent California theaters like the La Jolla Playhouse and the San Diego Repertory Theater are expected to be among those that will receive far less state money.
The Massachusetts House Ways and Means Committee has voted to cut its state cultural council's budget to $10 million from $19 million. Institutions likely to be affected range from a small children's art program in the Jamaica Plain section of Boston to the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art in North Adams.
States that have traditionally given little to arts groups are now giving even less. The Georgia Council for the Arts has announced that its grants to cultural institutions this year will be $2.5 million, down from $2.7 million last year. This will be the smallest amount the council has distributed since 1989.
Cities have joined states in making cultural cutbacks. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, where the budget gap is estimated at $5 billion or more, has proposed cutting the Cultural Affairs Department budget to $110.4 million this year, a reduction of $19.1 million. Many involved in the arts locally fear that, given the size of the deficit, the New York City Council will not be able to restore much of the proposed cut, as it did in the past. 
Mayor Anthony M. Masiello of Buffalo has recommended cutting all city funds for the arts. One of the mayor's supporters, Councilman Joseph Golombek Jr., told the City Council at a meeting this month, "If you ask my constituents, 'Would you like more police officers or more arts?' my constituents would tell me they want more officers and to forget about the arts."
The King County Office of Cultural Resources, which serves Seattle and the surrounding area, will have a budget of $700,000 in the coming fiscal year, compared with $1.3 million this year and $2.3 million last year. Officials are considering turning the office into an autonomous authority that will raise private as well as public funds.
Future prospects for the proposed Guthrie complex also look bleak. "This project was conceived during the dot-com boom of the mid-90's," said Paul Metsa, a Minneapolis musician who heads a group campaigning to preserve the Guthrie's current building. "The governor decided that it's just too expensive, given today's conditions. A lot of people would probably agree. This puts the whole project in doubt because they were counting on that state money to give them momentum to raise the rest of what they need."
Joe Dowling, the Guthrie's artistic director, called the governor's veto "a serious body blow" and said the executive committee of the theater's board would meet soon to review "what steps we can take to move the project forward." Earlier he had acknowledged that "without this money, we will have to delay the project for quite some time or even abandon it altogether." He said the theater would continue but would have to curtail its theatrical and educational ambitions.
"In terms of encouraging new writers, staging new plays and co-productions, and sending our plays out to other places, we won't be able to do what we hoped," he said. 
"We won't reach that national or international level," he added. "Other theaters that get the funds they need will surpass us."
The new Guthrie complex was to have cost $125 million. Private fund-raising began 18 months ago, and since then, nearly $60 million has been raised. Those in charge of the drive were confident that they could raise considerably more, but considered state support essential. 
The legislature ended its session on Sunday, hours after voting to approve the bond issue, so it cannot override Governor Ventura's veto. Bond issues for nonemergency projects in Minnesota are considered only every two years, so it is unlikely that the legislature will reconsider the Guthrie project until at least 2004.

First Cars: Ah, Sweet T-Bird Of Youth

BYLINE:  By GAY JERVEY 

 BODY:
ONE was an 11-year-old child, so entranced by his first glimpse of it at the 1939 World's Fair that he later sketched the vision from memory. Today, he has both the framed drawing and its inspiration at his Connecticut home. Another was determined to surprise his wife with a 40th birthday present that would remind her of a time when she felt young, adventurous and full of promise. Still others were influenced by a specific movie, a television show, a glimpse of something on the street -- or just an overwhelming desire to go as fast as humanly possible.
 They come from varying walks of life, from far-flung corners of the country and from different generations, yet they all share the same thing: a love of cars, in most cases very specific cars. And their love borders on obsession. 
 The 11-year-old was Malcolm Pray Jr., and the object of his desire was a 1936 Delahaye, one of only seven ever made by the French company. Twenty-five years after he first laid eyes on it, Mr. Pray found the Delahaye on Long Island and drove it home to Greenwich, Conn., where he now has a collection of more than 80 vintage automobiles. 
 The doting husband is a 44-year-old Manhattan lawyer named Lawrence Savell. His wife, Cathy, dreamed of a 1966 Pontiac Catalina convertible, which she had first talked wistfully about when the two were dating. After searching high and low, Mr. Savell used the Internet to find the exact same car his wife had driven as a high school senior in Massachusetts and presented it to her, complete with the original 1966 license plates and a CD of 1960's songs he had made for her. 
"You see a certain car, and you say, 'I want that and I'm not stopping until I get it,' " said Edward Gunyo, a 50-year-old financial consultant in Minneapolis who spent nearly 15 years lusting after the 1963 Buick Electra convertible, which had first mesmerized him at an auto show. In 1978, he finally stumbled upon one, buried in a friend's garage. 
"I told the guy that I had to have it," Mr. Gunyo said. "And I gave him my '52 Buick for it." To this day, Mr. Gunyo keeps a $2 toy model of the Buick, a birthday present in 1963, displayed in a glass case, and from time to time, he takes his Electra out for a drive.
"A lot of this is simply wish fulfillment," said David Brownell, who was the editor of Hemmings Motor News from 1983 to 1999. "In my case, I grew up down the street from a garage that specialized in sports-car tuning, and I would stand on the street corner on Saturdays and watch this wonderful parade of MG's and Jaguars and Austin-Healeys go by. And I would tell myself that I had to have them."
Today, Mr. Brownell's garage houses a 1924 Bentley, a 1961 Morgan and a 1954 Austin-Healey.
Car enthusiasts tend to fall into several camps. There are the rich and serious, like Mr. Pray, who amass collections that turn other gearheads British racing green with envy. And then there are those who are held in thrall by specific models out of sheer nostalgia. Whatever the case, the automobile is far more than just a means of transportation: it is a personal time machine, a reminder of who we were when we first spotted it years ago.
"Ask 100 different people why they have that one special car, and you'll get 100 different reasons," said Chris Wolfe, the author of "The Buick Riviera: 1963-1973," published by Classic Motor Books. (A lover of vintage American cars, Mr. Wolfe was once so determined to own a particular 1966 Riviera Gran Sport that he traveled from his home in Denver to Cheyenne, Wyo., and used a machete to cut the car out of the weeds in an abandoned salvage yard.)
In the early 1950's, the Museum of Modern Art recognized the automobile as an art form, and since then, striking examples have often been described as "rolling sculpture," a term that some clearly do not find hyperbolic.
Growing up in the 1960's, one Manhattan architect describes himself as being so "flabbergasted by gorgeous cars" that he would spend hours drawing pictures of them. He is particularly fond of BMW's, and years later he spotted a 3.0 CS parked on the street in Greenwich Village. From then on, he would take detours to visit it, as he strolled along to dinner or a movie. (He asked that his name not be used to protect his obsession.)
After searching for his own 3.0 CS -- at one point he went to Monterey, Calif., to attend a BMW show -- he decided that the 3.0 CS, like many beauties, would just be too high strung. So he opted for what he considered the next best thing, a BMW 6-series coupe that he found in Chicago.
When that car was later totaled in an accident, the architect was determined to replace it with a BMW that was as close to the original as possible. He found his new car on a business trip in Southern California.
"It was sort of like you see this incredible blonde," he said, laughing. "You see them, and then you lose them. But then suddenly you see them again, and you just can't believe your luck!"
Others want a particular car for the simple pleasure of driving it. Take Dr. John Carbone, an orthopedic surgeon in Baltimore.
For Dr. Carbone, 40, the worst part about medical school was not the hours nor the pressure, but the fact that he was forced to drive "a little economy car, and it was making me nuts." After all, his first love was a 1980 Fiat Spider 2000 that he bought in high school. 
In the mid-90's, when Dr. Carbone was a resident in surgery, Porsche produced the Carrera 4S, a special edition of its all-wheel-drive sports car. And Dr. Carbone vowed to own one. Now he does, and he drives daily. 
"Let me tell you something about a great car," Dr. Carbone said. "When I'm at the wheel in a car that's fun to drive and I have got time for myself where I can regroup mentally, I can focus. It becomes an enjoyable experience as opposed to just transportation."
Then there are those who collect cars because they represent particular eras. For 48-year-old Wayne Maddox, who owns Maddox Vintage Autos and Parts in Denver, that era is the 1950's and 1960's, which are exemplified to him by the television shows that he was glued to growing up -- the likes of "The Beverly Hillbillies" and "The Dick Van Dyke Show." 
So Mr. Maddox owns a 1957 Dodge, a 1959 Chrysler New Yorker and a 1956 Lincoln Continental Mark II and recently built a copy of the police cruiser featured in "Car 54, Where Are You?"
"Cars are tangible markers of happy times in your life," Mr. Maddox said, "times that you want to go back to."
Thomas Cotter, a 48-year-old automotive public-relations and marketing consultant in Davis, N.C., would agree. Ever since he was in the fifth grade, Mr. Cotter had yearned for a 1964 Cobra convertible. Until several years ago, though, the car had eluded him because it was too expensive. But then in 2000, he sold his marketing business and came into some cash.
"I said to my wife, 'It's Cobra time!' " Mr. Cotter said. Through the Internet, he found the perfect Cobra in Walnut Creek, Calif., and plunked down $167,000 to buy it. "When I saw it, I said, 'Oh my God, that's my car! Unmolested."
Mr. Cotter traveled to California and drove the Cobra home to North Carolina along two-lane highways, including Route 66. And despite bits of snow and rain, he never once put the top up.

HEADLINE: Notes From San Jose; 
Silicon Valley Grows Up

BYLINE:  By Claire Tristram; Claire Tristram writes frequently about technology and business in Silicon Valley.

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif. 

 BODY:
On some stretches of Highway 880, curling around the east side of San Francisco Bay, you can drive by row after row of pristine office buildings, constructed just before the bust, never occupied by a single tenant. These days, Silicon Valley's traffic, like the valley's ambitions, isn't as ferocious as it used to be. Sometimes it's even possible to get from San Francisco to San Jose in less than 90 minutes.
 Maybe because I have lived in this part of the world since the Macintosh was new, I tend to remember Silicon Valley more for its excitement than for its excesses. I can still feel the jaw-dropping amazement that struck me the first time I saw the World Wide Web, in a computer lab at Silicon Graphics in 1994. Sock puppets and Super Bowl ads I tend to forget about. 
 So in the midst of the biggest bust the valley has seen since the early 1990's, I console myself with the knowledge that the excitement will return, as it always does. Right now the most important story for Silicon Valley just may be in Washington, where the valley and Hollywood are fighting over the future of digital entertainment. Congress is currently considering legislation that would require the computer industry to develop "security system standards" to protect the transmission and duplication of digital content.
This is not just an intrastate feud between Northern and Southern California. It is a fight with global implications, and the valley's peculiarly technophilic culture, usually part of its charm, may not serve it so well.
Of course, what some find charming others see as condescending. Back when Napster was still in the early stages of being sued for copyright infringement, its executives would publicly express their belief, with all sincerity, that Napster would one day be embraced by the music industry: the industry just didn't understand the technology yet.
Alas, understanding never came. Despite credible studies suggesting that sharing music files online actually leads consumers to buy more CD's rather than fewer, the association pressed forward with its suit and Napster was shuttered, its remains subject to a fire sale just last week. Some 80 million Napster users were scattered to the wind. And digital music distribution has become a dead zone where investors fear to tread.
The same broken dialogue is now repeating itself between Silicon Valley and Hollywood. Hollywood went to Congress to block any sale of DVD's without legislatively mandated copy protection. It sued to block the sale of MP3 players and digital VCR's because these devices make it easy to make fast, durable, portable copies of music or movies.
Silicon Valley responds -- in that rational, superior way technologists sometimes have -- that of course digital technology makes possible better reproductions that last longer than their analog counterparts. Hollywood, valley executives say, doesn't understand the upside potential and is stifling innovation. Besides, these guys said the same thing about the VCR, and in 2001 consumers spent more than twice as much on videos as they did at the box office.
In other words: Hollywood, you just don't understand.
It may not be the most politic approach. But it represents a fundamental difference in viewpoint: Silicon Valley doesn't see digital theft as a problem that can be solved -- there, done. It's more like an arms race, of an incredibly positive sort, with each innovation demanding new strategies and providing new opportunities. The computer industry has sold an all-digital product -- software -- for decades. It can be copied and distributed every bit as easily as digital movies can. And yet the valley has largely succeeded, through a relentless publicity campaign as well as litigation, in preventing the widespread piracy of its intellectual property.
Hollywood's latest bid for protection from digital theft is called the Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act, sponsored by Ernest Hollings of South Carolina, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee. At its heart, the legislation aims to force Silicon Valley and Hollywood to work together to come up with a way to protect copyrighted digital material; if they don't, the government will step in. Technologists see any "solution" as impossible, or at least fleeting, since no software has yet been written that can completely prevent piracy.
But simply stating "you just don't understand, Senator" -- even if it is a perfectly reasonable response -- isn't going to work in this latest battle, as Silicon Valley is learning. Hollywood does a far better job than the valley of speaking in one voice on Capitol Hill. Painfully, if not surprisingly, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, former mayor of San Francisco, is a co-sponsor of the Hollings bill; Hollywood has contributed roughly twice as much money to her as Silicon Valley has.
So the discourse is changing. Andy Grove, the chairman of Intel, will speak to anyone who will listen about the importance of the free market, which is the standard technolibertarian argument. But he now also acknowledges the valley as a powerful part of the mainstream economy and speaks of the fight as one mature industry against another. Why should the government, he asks, have to protect the movie industry from new technology?
Silicon Valley, a famously fractious place, is also becoming more unified. Mr. Grove and Steve Jobs, chief executive of Apple, have been vocal opponents of the Hollywood proposal. The Business Software Alliance, an industry group known for its vigorous pursuit of digital pirates, which includes Microsoft and I.B.M. as members, is also opposed to the legislation. 
Still, old habits die hard, and one of the valley's oldest is its tendency to thumb its nose at authority (even as it exercises a fair amount itself). Gateway, the large computer maker, runs television ads that urge its customers to download music (with permission from the artists) from its Web site. Regardless of the effectiveness of these tactics, they have succeeded in angering Hollywood.
In some ways, this populist activism is curious for an industry that has increasingly served the needs of business rather than those of consumers. But maybe that's the best thing about this fight. It has galvanized this place as nothing has for at least a couple of years. It reminds the industry of its relevance. And maybe, just maybe, by exposing its immaturity -- after all, the technology industry can no longer act like a brilliant but misunderstood child -- this debate will help Silicon Valley grow up.

To the Editor:
 Re "The Fight for the Soul of Coal Country," by Michael Lipton (Op-Ed, May 17): 
 As a child growing up in West Virginia, I heard stories from my grandfather about life as a coal miner in the 1920's. In those days, coal companies maintained an iron grip over miners and their communities. 
The message I took from my grandfather was that the fight against the coal companies was not just about a paycheck but a way of life.
Eighty years later, West Virginians are still fighting to protect their way of life. But today, residents of coal country have to worry not only about the economic landscape but also the landscape itself. With a wink and a nod from the Bush administration, coal companies are now dynamiting mountaintops and pouring the leftover rubble into streams and creeks.
With closed-door deals between politicians and coal company executives, who needs the 1920's?

HEADLINE: Durable Goods Orders Rise, Hint of New Capital Spending 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23 

 BODY:
The nation's factories, hard hit in the economic slump last year, gave off fresh signs of improvement in April, with orders for manufactured goods rising for a fifth consecutive month. 
 The Commerce Department reported today that orders for durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, jumped 1.1 percent, with demand especially strong for cars, communications equipment and machinery. 
 Economists said the data might point to the beginning of a turnaround in capital spending by businesses, something necessary for a broad recovery in the economy. Deep cuts in such spending were an essential factor in the economic downturn. 
"This report seems to indicate that the collapse in investment is behind us and we are in the beginning stages of a rebound," said Joel L. Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisers. 
The 1.1 percent advance followed a 0.2 percent increase in March and was larger than many analysts had expected. Factories are increasing production as businesses begin to replenish inventories. Through much of 2001, many companies worked to reduce their stocks of unsold goods. 
In April, new orders for cars, trucks and auto parts jumped 12 percent, the biggest increase since August 1998. The month before, orders in those categories fell 1.2 percent. 
Even with the vehicle and parts increase, orders for all transportation equipment fell 2.6 percent in April -- resulting from an outsized drop in aircraft orders of 37.1 percent.
Excluding transportation, durable goods orders increased 2.9 percent in April, the biggest increase since October. 
Orders for communications equipment rose 12 percent, after an 11 percent decline in March. Machinery orders were up 4 percent after a 1.5 percent drop. 
In another economic report, fewer Americans filed new claims for unemployment insurance, but people who are out of work continue to have trouble finding new jobs. 
The Labor Department said today that for the week ended May 18, initial jobless claims dropped by 9,000, to 416,000, an eight-week low. But even with the decline, economists said claims were still high, suggesting that the job market remained sluggish. 
The number of laid-off workers continuing to draw jobless benefits climbed in the week ended May 11 to a 19-year high of 3.87 million.

HEADLINE: TECHNOLOGY; 
Recession? Don't Tell the Video Game Industry

BYLINE:  By JOHN MARKOFF 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 23 

 BODY:
Spurred by technology advances that create ever more realistic renderings of adventure, sports fantasy and violence, the video game industry is in a remarkable boom.
 As the industry gathers here for this year's Electronic Entertainment Exhibition, or E3, it appears to have created its own economy. Despite the recession, a prolonged technology slump and Sept. 11, sales of video game hardware, software and accessories increased 43 percent last year, to a record $9.4 billion, according to the market research firm NPD Group. 
 A number of industry executives and analysts say that the current economic wave is rooted in both the cycle for new generations of video game players and the demographic shifts that have taken game playing out of the realm of cult status and into the mainstream. 
"Two generations have now grown up with computing and interactivity," said Doug Lowenstein, president of the Interactive Digital Software Association, the industry trade group that sponsors the conference. "Playing video games is as natural to these generations as watching television and listening to the radio was to earlier generations."
Sales of game software alone reached $6.4 billion last year, putting the game industry in striking distance of Hollywood, which had box-office sales of $8.35 billion in 2001. And video game executives predict this year will be even stronger.
"Last fall the U.S. video game market simply took off," said Bruno Bonnell, chief executive of Infogrames Entertainment, a maker of games for video game consoles and personal computers that has experienced a turnaround in its business recently.
A key element of the boom is the realism that new technology has brought to the games. "The video game industry has come of age," said Roger McNamee, a Silicon Valley technology investor. "The visual look of the games is astonishing." 
The increasing move toward realism could be seen in the movie-like appearance of games like Sony Entertainment's "Getaway," which is based on 50,000 digitized images of downtown London, as well as a remarkable crop of 2003 football games from Electronic Arts, Sony's 989 Studios, Sega and Microsoft.
The games take advantage of a technology known as motion capture that is now widely used in the industry, which uses the digitized performance of real athletes. Their moves are stored in a database on the game disk and seamlessly woven together to give a remarkably lifelike feel. 
The industry is also benefiting from an explosion of tie-ins between video games and Hollywood movies like "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone," "Lord of the Rings," "Spider-Man" and even a three-movie deal for the video game derivative Laura Croft.
Indeed, it was Ms. Croft, the digitized creature, not her flesh-and-blood doppelganger, Angelina Jolie, who made news here Monday by signing with Creative Artists Agency in the first-ever Hollywood agent deal for a digital character.
The new version of the program, scheduled to ship in November, will be titled "Tomb Raider: Angel of Darkness." In it, the digitized animation of Ms. Croft will be made up of 5,000 polygons -- the virtual wire frame that underlies an animated figure -- compared with 500 in earlier versions, making her much more lifelike. Doom III, which will be released next year, renders some characters with as many as 500,000 polygons. The current generation of computer hardware from all three video game makers is specially designed to make it possible to render millions of polygons almost instantaneously.
As game software and hardware become more elaborate and the profit potential grows, the development budgets of hit software titles are swelling as well. Costs now routinely fall from $3 million to $6 million, and $10 million is no longer unusual. The development team for the latest Laura Croft game, which is being produced in England, has jumped to 50 from 15.
And when the costs of translating games to multiple formats and marketing them are included, expenses may reach as high as $50 million to $60 million, software executives said. 
Nevertheless, hit titles like last year's top-selling "Grand Theft Auto III," which has shipped more than three million copies at a typical retail price of $49 since its introduction last fall, can be wildly profitable. That goes a long way to explaining the intense rivalry among the three video game player manufacturers: Microsoft, Nintendo and Sony.
Sony, which brought its PlayStation 2 to market two years ago, is clearly in a commanding position at the moment, and its executives declared victory in their rivalry with Microsoft at a news conference before the exhibition opened earlier this week.
"This is a harvest year for us," said Ken Kutaragi, president and chief executive of Sony Computer Entertainment Inc. While video game players are initially sold at a loss to build market share and to entice software developers, he said that the PS2 is now profitable, even after the company recently cut its price by $100, to $199, in an effort to put pressure on its rivals.
In fact, much of the discussion at this year's show centered not around whether Microsoft would be able to catch Sony, but whether it would be possible for Microsoft to edge out Nintendo, whose GameCube is now doing well after early miscues.
Although Microsoft made an ambitious showing at this year's event, much of the industry is still skeptical that the company will be able to translate the slim technical lead of its Xbox into a major factor in the market. Many game players at this year's show said that although the Xbox appeared to have a slight technical advantage, Microsoft had been able to develop only one or two games that exploit it.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 30, 2002

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Friday about the economic boom in the video game industry misspelled the name of the main character of the Tomb Raider series of video games. It is Lara Croft, not Laura.

HEADLINE: Scientists Develop the Universe's Baby Pictures 

BYLINE:  By DENNIS OVERBYE 

 BODY:
Using a radio telescope so high in the Andes that they needed oxygen masks to visit it, astronomers have taken what they described yesterday as the most detailed pictures yet of the birth of the universe, resolving for the first time the seeds from which clusters of galaxies grew.
 The observations, made by an array of microwave antennas known as the Cosmic Background Imager, mapped minute variations in the brightness of radio waves thought to be left over from the Big Bang. They reveal the universe when it was only some 300,000 years old and about as hot as a cool star, stippled with faint hot and cool patches, about one-hundredth the apparent size of the moon. 
 Analysis of the images, astronomers said, confirms what is rapidly becoming the conventional theory of the Big Bang, which says that the universe was born in a fiery blast 14 billion years ago, is geometrically "flat" over the largest cosmic scales and is dominated today by a mysterious dark matter and by an even more mysterious dark energy that is now pushing the cosmos apart. 
The new analysis, they said, also supports a controversial modification of the Big Bang theory that holds that the universe underwent a brief spurt of hyperexpansion, known as inflation, during the first instant of time.
At a news conference yesterday at the National Science Foundation in Washington, Dr. Anthony Readhead, an astronomy professor at the California Institute of Technology and the leader of the multinational project, called the results "a very powerful confirmation of the standard cosmological model," adding, "For the first time, it places theories of galaxy formation on a firm observational footing." A set of five papers by Dr. Readhead and his collaborators has been submitted to the Astrophysical Journal Letters.
"It is hard to imagine a more satisfying marriage of theory and experiment," said Dr. Richard Bond of the Canadian Institute for Theoretical Physics, who worked closely with the Caltech team. "One thing after another falls into place for these theories we've been working on."
Astronomers and cosmologists outside the team said the work was important. "It's exciting that when you look at new phenomena, things still work," said Dr. Max Tegmark, a cosmologist at the University of Pennsylvania. 
Dr. Michael Turner, a cosmologist at the University Chicago, said the new work was emblematic of "the new age in cosmology, where we have more data than parameters." 
The cosmic background, a nearly uniform hiss of microwave radiation that fills the sky, has riveted astronomers' attention ever since it was discovered in 1965 by Dr. Arno Penzias and Dr. Robert Wilson, Bell Laboratories researchers and subsequent Nobel laureates.
According to theoretical calculations, the primordial gases of the early universe should have been laced with tiny temperature variations, the result of acoustic waves in the rapidly expanding fireball. The fireball was, in effect, ringing like a bell, with a main note and overtones.
The "notes" on which the early fireball was singing give a direct way to calculate cosmological parameters like the geometry of space-time, the density of the universe and its rate of expansion.
However, because water vapor in the atmosphere also emits microwaves and the cosmic radiation is very faint, it can be studied only from balloons and satellites. It was not until 1992 that NASA's COBE satellite first detected broad ripples in the cosmic background. Two years ago, a pair of balloon-borne experiments with higher resolution, nicknamed Boomerang and Maxima, succeeded in detecting the first of those cosmic notes, whose frequency indicates the geometry of space-time. According to Einstein's theory of general relativity, space is warped in various ways, depending on the density of mass and energy in it. Modern cosmologists, including Einstein, have long favored a "flat" universe with no overall warp, a prejudice which was confirmed by Boomerang and Maxima.
Last year Boomerang and another experiment at the South Pole called DASI found the next two higher notes on the cosmic scale, whose relation helps theorists gauge the densities of ordinary and dark matter in the universe. Similar results were submitted to the journal Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society yesterday by a team of European astronomers, based on observations from the Very Small Array at Tenerife in the Canary Islands.
The Cosmic Background Imager, which was designed for high-resolution observations, was built at Caltech and shipped to a site 16,700 feet high in Chile's Atacama desert to get it above interfering water vapor in late 1999. It has now found at least four notes, fading in strength as they go higher, Dr. Readhead reported.
This damping at high frequencies is an important result, several astronomers said, because it was consistent with theoretical predictions that the higher notes would be blurred and fade the way low notes persist longer than high notes when a bell is struck.
Moreover, Dr. Readhead said that an analysis using only the high notes yielded the same cosmic parameters as a previous analysis based on the lower frequencies. That was important, he said, because it was an independent test of the standard model.
"Nature would have to be doubly mischievous to make us come to the same wrong answer from two different sets of data," Dr. Readhead said.
The confirmation of cosmic flatness is particularly vital to the inflation hypothesis, which was ventured first in 1980 by Dr. Alan Guth, a physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "Inflation makes a proposal for what propelled the Big Bang -- a repulsive form of gravity," Dr. Guth said at the news conference.
According to Dr. Guth, a brief burst of antigravity would have ballooned the nascent cosmos to enormous proportions, smoothing its irregularities and causing the observable universe to appear flat the way a balloon up close looks flat. Dr. Guth based this idea on theories of high-energy particle physics, and at the time there was little evidence that the universe was flat.
The new data also are consistent with another prediction of inflation, namely that all the notes in the fireball should contribute nearly equally in a kind of cosmic "white noise."
Dr. Guth recalled doing the latter calculation back in 1982. "I never thought for a moment that in my lifetime these calculations would be compared with observations," he said yesterday.
Dr. Bond said that although these results did not prove inflation, their consistency with it would make it hard for the authors of alternative theories.

HEADLINE: Manhattanites Fared Best In New York City in 1990's 

BYLINE:  By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
The 1990's benefited Manhattan and Manhattanites far more than they helped the rest of New York City and much of the region, according to new data from the 2000 census that suggest that the four other boroughs and some suburban counties ended up at least in some ways worse off.
 Manhattan had the biggest percentage increase in median household income of any county in New York State and of all but one county in New Jersey. It had the state's biggest jump in the median earnings of men, the median value of housing skyrocketed and the number of families in poverty dropped. 
 By contrast, Brooklyn, Queens, the Bronx and Staten Island had some of the state's biggest percentage declines in median household income and some of the only drops in median family income. All four had a rise in poverty and big dips in men's median earnings. Housing values slipped. 
The data, made public yesterday, puzzled some people who said they had expected to see the economic gains of the late 1990's more broadly shared. New York City officials raised doubts about the reliability of the income and employment numbers, which they said other government figures contradicted.
Some economists and demographers suggested that heavy immigration into Queens, Brooklyn and the Bronx, and some nearby cities, might have helped suppress the median income figures. While immigrants may have been making more than they did before they came, many were also making less than many of the native-born New Yorkers who moved out of the city in the 1990's.
But other economists said New York City in the 1990's also lost some higher-paying jobs in sectors like government and gained lower-paying jobs. New York City was hit harder than other areas of the country by the recession of the early 1990's, they said, and took longer to recover.
"The report reminds us what a microcosm New York City is of things that have gone well and things that have gone badly," said Jared Bernstein, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal policy organization in Washington.
According to the numbers for New York and New Jersey, median household and family incomes rose over all in both states. But poverty rates on average rose. On the other hand, the percentage of female-headed households with children in poverty dropped, part of a nationwide decline.
In New York, the top 10 counties with the biggest percentage increases in household income included not only Manhattan but also Columbia and Putnam. The counties with the biggest drops included Dutchess and Ulster. In Rockland County, there was a slight decline.
Only Hunterdon County, N.J., with a 12.68 percent increase, topped Manhattan's 12.32 percent jump. Other New Jersey counties with big gains included Somerset, Monmouth and Morris. Those with the least improvement included Essex, Hudson, Passaic, Union and Bergen.
"How could people buy all those McMansions?" said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers, remarking on the less-than-exorbitant growth in median income. "Why were Nieman Marcus and Saks doing such great business?"
He said that the answer lay in capital gains among the small percentage of people who have them -- a form of income not included in the Census Bureau's definition until it is realized. "That's what I think gave shape to the real high-end expenditures during the second half of the 90's," he said. "It was really capital gains income."
While median income rose modestly in many places and was flat or declined in others, per capita income grew significantly. A rise in per capita income at a time of little change in median income is seen as an indicator of a widening gap between rich and poor.
Per capita income is derived by dividing total income by the population; for that reason, it is sensitive to extremes on either end of the income spectrum. Mean household or mean family income is simply the income of the family in the very middle; extremes affect that figure less.
New York City planning officials questioned the reliability of the census data on income and employment. They said State Department of Labor data showed big increases in the number of people employed in and around New York, while the census showed no gains. They said other government data also suggested increases in income citywide.
They said those disparities might be traceable in part to the city's success in tracking down people for the 2000 census who had been missed in 1990. Since many of those people are assumed to have been on the lower end of the income spectrum, they said, their addition to the census may have contributed to a misleading result.
The new data illuminate for the first time everything from percentage of the population born outside the United States to the languages they speak at home and the percentage of people's income they spend on rent.
In New York City, nearly 36 percent of all residents were foreign born -- slightly below the 1910 peak of 41 percent. More than one-third of the foreign born lived in Queens and one-third lived in Brooklyn. An additional 16 percent were in Manhattan, 13 percent in the Bronx and 3 percent in Staten Island.
The number of New Yorkers of Italian ancestry, long the largest group, dropped by 17 percent, to 690,000, or nearly 9 percent of the population; the number of people of Irish ancestry dropped by one-fifth, to 422,000. The number of residents with West Indian ancestry grew by 40 percent, to 550,000, and the number of people of sub-Saharan African ancestry more than doubled to 122,000. Of the population age 5 and over, 48 percent spoke a language other than English at home, up from 41 percent in 1990. Nearly half of those said they were not proficient in English. 
In New Jersey, the foreign-born population increased by more than 50 percent, to more than 1.4 million, or 17.5 percent of the population. One-quarter of all residents over age 5 spoke a language other than English at home. Italians, Irish and Germans remained the three leading ancestry groups, making up 46.4 of the state's population.

HEADLINE: Pope Banishes a Shadow Left By Bulgaria's Tie to Shooting 

BYLINE:  By ALESSANDRA STANLEY 

DATELINE: SOFIA, Bulgaria, May 23 

 BODY:
John Paul II reassured Bulgarians this evening that he bore no grudge over accusations that the Bulgarian secret service may have tried to have him killed in 1981.
 "I say to all that I have never ceased to love the Bulgarian people," the pope told a throng of well-wishers crowding the square outside Alexander Nevsky Cathedral immediately after arriving from Baku, Azerbaijan. 
 The ailing pope, who took language lessons in the Vatican before he left, began his speech in Bulgarian, but his quavering voice was hard to follow. When he reached the allusion to the 1981 assassination attempt, the pope turned his text over to an interpreter. The crowd responded with cheers. 
Three Bulgarians were charged with aiding the Turkish gunman, Mehmet Ali Agca, but were acquitted by an Italian court for lack of evidence. The verdict, in falling short of a clear "not guilty," has cast a shadow on Bulgaria ever since.
John Paul's five-day tour of Bulgaria and Azerbaijan is his first foreign trip since sex abuse scandals began engulfing the Roman Catholic Church in the United States.
But the pope's efforts to return attention to his peace-seeking missions in Eastern Orthodox territory were dimmed by news that yet another American bishop, Rembert G. Weakland, archbishop of Milwaukee, is under suspicion.
Archbishop Weakland acknowledged he paid $450,000 to settle a sexual assault complaint against him by an adult male student 20 years ago, though he denied the charges.
The pope did not mention the matter tonight, and his press secretary made it clear the Vatican did not want the scandal to seep into the papal journey. "As a matter of procedure, we do not comment on topics, even big ones, while we are away from the Vatican out of courtesy for the country we are visiting," the spokesman, Joaquin Navarro-Valls, said tonight. "When we return to the Holy See, a comment is possible."
Once a Communist state, Bulgaria wants a Vatican stamp of approval as it seeks entry to the European Union and NATO. The pope's presence in Bulgaria provides the kind of absolution the government has long sought. Even some Bulgarians doubt the acquitted men were entirely innocent.
"We want to apologize that it happened and show him that the Bulgarian people did not have anything to do with his attempted murder," Venka Misteva, 65, an economist, explained as she waited for a glimpse of the first pope ever to visit Bulgaria.
The pope wants another chance to visit a mostly Eastern Orthodox country after previous trips to Romania, Georgia and Ukraine, steppingstones in his lifelong goal of mending the 1,000 year rift between Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy.
In Baku earlier today, the pope tried to show his good intentions by promising $20,000 toward the million-dollar ransom that Chechen bandits have demanded from Azeri Orthodox Church leaders for the return of one of their clerics.
Patriarch Maxim of Bulgaria attended the welcome ceremony today, led by Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov, but kept an icy distance. 
The two religious leaders will meet when the pope pays a courtesy call on Friday, but no joint prayer services are planned. "We did not invite him," the patriarch said recently. "We only responded to his desire to visit us."
Orthodox leaders fear that the wealthier, more powerful Catholic church is using reconciliation as a Trojan horse to push into Orthodox territory and convert their believers.
The pope got a warmer response from Orthodox believers in Azerbaijan, where they form a tiny minority of that mostly Muslim nation and find common cause with the even tinier Catholic community of 120 people, including expatriates.
It took many hundreds of foreign visitors and Muslim guests to fill the 5,000 seats in the Palace of Hard Ball Games where the pope celebrated mass this morning. "Thrilled and flabbergasted," is how James Tilley, an Oklahoma oilman in Baku who assisted at the altar, said he felt when he heard the pope was coming so far for so few.
During the service, the Baku congregation also felt a moment of fear when a man on crutches scuttled through the crowds and came within 15 feet of the pope before security guards grabbed him. After determining that the man, Kazim Azizov, an addled Azeri refugee from Armenia, was harmless, security guards escorted him back to the altar so he could kiss the pope's hand and receive a papal blessing.
Tamara Akhundova, an Azeri Muslim, said she was moved. "To me the pope looks like a very old, sick man who has a lot of love in his heart."

HEADLINE: TRACES OF TERROR: THE SHOE BOMB CASE; 
Prosecutors See Plot in Attempted Bombing

BYLINE:  By PAM BELLUCK 

DATELINE: BOSTON, May 23 

 BODY:
There is evidence that the man accused of trying to blow up a Paris-to-Miami flight with bombs hidden in his sneakers did not act alone, according to court documents filed today.
 A memorandum by federal prosecutors in the case of the man, Richard C. Reid, stated that "an examination of one of the explosive devices in Reid's shoes disclosed evidence of a confederate (or confederates)." 
 Investigators have ruled out Mr. Reid as the source of a human hair found in the bomb and a palm print found on the paper used to make the detonator, the memorandum said. Mr. Reid, it said, "was not unassisted in his efforts to destroy" American Airlines Flight 63 on Dec. 22. 
The 36-page memorandum, filed in response to a motion to lift restrictions on Mr. Reid's ability to communicate with his lawyers, also stated that Mr. Reid wrote in an e-mail message to his mother two days before the flight that he had "a duty" to "help remove the oppressive American forces from the Muslim land."
Mr. Reid, a British citizen, is charged with nine counts, including attempted murder. An indictment against him issued in January contends that while the plane was in flight, Mr. Reid, 28, tried to light a fuse sticking out of the tongue of one of his black high-top sneakers. Flight attendants and passengers overpowered Mr. Reid and the flight was diverted to Boston.
The indictment also asserts that Mr. Reid received training at Al Qaeda terrorist camps in Afghanistan. On Monday, Robert S. Mueller III, the F.B.I. director, said he believed "an Al Qaeda bomb maker" made the explosives in Mr. Reid's shoes.
The prosecutors' memorandum said Mr. Reid told law enforcement agents after his arrest that "he decided to choose an American target after the United States began bombing the Taliban in Afghanistan."
According to the memorandum, Mr. Reid "claimed to have chosen to attack an airplane because he believed an airplane attack, especially during the holiday season, would cause the American public to lose confidence in airline security and stop traveling, leading to a substantial loss of revenue which would, in turn, hurt the American economy."
On Monday, Mr. Reid's lawyers filed a motion to suppress the statements he made to law enforcement officials. The motion contended that Mr. Reid had either invoked his right to remain silent, or was unable to stop talking because of the Valium and other drugs that doctors on board the flight used to sedate him.
Mr. Reid's lawyers did not return calls for comment today.
The document filed today said that Mr. Reid wrote an e-mail message to his mother, Lesley Hughes, on Dec. 20, saying, "What I am doing is part of the ongoing war between Islam and disbelief (and as such a duty upon me as a Muslim)." --------------------

Advisory on Rail Attacks
(By The New York Times)
WASHINGTON, May 23 -- The Transportation Department advised subway and rail systems around the country on Wednesday to remain alert because of the possibility of terrorist attacks, a spokesman for the Transportation Department confirmed this evening.
The action falls short of being a warning, because there was no specific information about where or when such an attack might occur, said Chet Lunner, a spokesman for the Transportation Department. But, Mr. Lunner said, "information came from the intelligence community about the possibility of actions against subway trains."
Reuters reported this evening that subway and rail systems had been warned.
The advisory did not call for any specific actions, other than maintaining alertness. The Department did not issue any public announcement.

HEADLINE: In New York, a Long Way From Here to Here 

BYLINE:  By JANNY SCOTT 

 BODY:
New Yorkers who are smug about not having to spend hours on traffic-jammed highways to get to work may be surprised by some sobering news yesterday from the Census Bureau: that people in four of the five boroughs fritter away more time getting to work than those anywhere else in the state.
 In fact, the average travel times for residents of Staten Island, Brooklyn, the Bronx and Queens top not only those in every one of the state's 58 other counties. They also exceed the average trips to work in every county in New Jersey, Connecticut and most of the rest of the country. 
 Those four boroughs beat out every county in all 29 states that the bureau has reported so far in the flood of 2000 census data being let loose this month -- a group that includes California. Manhattan, which stands 11th in New York State in commuting time, ranked 193rd nationwide. 
By contrast, Los Angeles County, the notorious butt of freeway-congestion jokes, was in a relatively respectable 252nd place nationally, neck and neck with Sullivan County, N.Y. (Yes, the one in the Catskills. The one with the covered bridges.)
"That's why I don't live there anymore," Alan E. Pisarski, the author of "Commuting in America," said of New York City. When a reporter said she had assumed people chose to live in the city at least in part to get to work quickly, Mr. Pisarski burst out laughing.
The city's standing as the capital of interminable commuting comes as no surprise to those who study such things. They said it had long been so. Several cited a basic law: The higher the rate of public transit ridership in a community, the longer the average travel time to work.
Rapid transit is a relative term.
So New Yorkers, who live in the city with the highest rate of transit ridership in the country, and who, from time to time, like to believe that some special virtue inheres in that fact, are being penalized for their willingness to cram themselves into subway cars and buses to get to work? "It depends on the alternative," said Anthony Downs, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution in Washington and the author of "Stuck in Traffic" (Brookings, 1992). "You don't know how long it would take them to drive."
Mr. Downs advises automobile commuters elsewhere to equip their cars with air-conditioning, a stereo radio, a telephone, a CD player, a microwave oven and an attractive traveling companion and then to "treat being stuck in traffic as part of their leisure time."
And New Yorkers?
"My basic advice would be move somewhere else," he said.
According to the Census Bureau, the average travel time to work for people living in Staten Island in 2000 was 43.9 minutes, up more than 10 percent from the 1990 average. For Brooklyn, it was 43.2 minutes; in the Bronx, 43; in Queens, 42.2; and in Manhattan, 30.5. All of those times had risen, too.
The problem is at least threefold, analysts said. It is not only that New Yorkers ride public transportation. It is also that a high proportion of the region's employment base works in the central business district. The figure is about 40 percent, compared with 15 to 20 percent in, say, Boston, an economist said.
Whereas most people elsewhere work in the county where they live, many New Yorkers are different, said Bruce Schaller, a consultant on urban transportation issues. More than half of all Queens residents who work do so in Manhattan, he said; 46 percent in Brooklyn do; and 40 percent in the Bronx.
Then there is New York City's sheer density and size.
"The fact is, it's possible to live in New York City and live in the northern Bronx and work in southern Brooklyn, which is a very long distance," Mr. Pisarski said.
As a result, it can take longer to travel into Manhattan from southeastern Queens than to travel into Manhattan from Philadelphia, said Robert Yaro, president of the Regional Plan Association. Round-trip commuting from places like Canarsie in Brooklyn or Co-op City in the Bronx swallows hours.
"My mom uses the M23," said Gene Russianoff, a staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, a transit riders advocacy group, referring to the crosstown bus. "Even as a 77-year-old, it's a close call whether she should walk or take the bus."
Peter Nixon, a consultant who moved from Brooklyn to Livingston, N.J., four years ago, said his old commuting trip into Manhattan was "a prison sentence."
He would be in the car before sunup and still never get to work in a reasonable amount of time. Now, he said, he sleeps in and is never late.
"Go back to that commute?" he said yesterday. "Never again."
The lower average travel times of suburbanites is explained in part by the fact that a relatively small proportion of suburbanites commute into New York City -- contrary to what many city residents think.
For city residents, living within a brief commuting time from one's work is a luxury enjoyed mostly by those who can afford to pay for it, Mr. Pisarski said.
Mr. Downs from Brookings made the case that congestion in general was not even a problem. It is simply the mechanism society uses to ration limited space during periods in which far more people want to use that space than can fit, he said.
"It is actually performing an important social function," he said. "Nobody believes this but me. But it's true."

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Internet: Online Advertising Slipped In 2001 

BYLINE:  By Susan Stellin (NYT) (Compiled by Steven P. Rosenfeld) 

 BODY:
 Internet advertising revenue in the United States fell 7.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2001, to $1.7 billion, the Interactive Advertising Bureau announced yesterday. It said the results were "not unexpected" considering the overall decline in advertising and the economic slowdown. For all of 2001, marketers spent $7.2 billion on Internet advertising, down 12 percent from 2000. The figures were compiled by PricewaterhouseCoopers for the Interactive Advertising Bureau, an industry trade association. The report also noted that consolidation in the online advertising market had continued, with the top 10 media companies garnering 76 percent of Internet advertising revenue last year.

HEADLINE: Designation in Hand, McCall Comes Out Firing in Convention Speech 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. and RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
As he accepted the designation for governor from the Democratic State Convention yesterday, H. Carl McCall recalled his own rise from poverty to power and vowed that if elected, he would devote himself to guaranteeing all children in New York State a first-rate education.
 The party delegates threw Mr. McCall their unanimous support after his main rival, Andrew M. Cuomo, stunned many of his supporters by pulling out of the convention. 
 Party leaders charged yesterday that Mr. Cuomo did so because he did not have the support of 25 percent of the delegates, which is needed to win a place on the primary ballot, a claim the Cuomo camp disputed. Mr. Cuomo said he would get into the Sept. 10 primary by circulating petitions, portraying himself as a populist running against the party machinery. 
Mr. Cuomo also continued his effort to divert attention from Mr. McCall's moment in the spotlight yesterday. He announced his first television ads yesterday, which will begin appearing upstate this week. The advertisements assail Gov. George E. Pataki's handling of the upstate economy and urge the state to hire some upstate companies to handle the rebuilding of Lower Manhattan. 
Without Mr. Cuomo, the convention quickly became a boisterous rally for Mr. McCall, the state comptroller and the first black man to win statewide office in New York. At noon, he took the stage at the Sheraton New York Hotel in Manhattan, surveyed the sea of faces and bouncing "McCall for Governor" signs, and said exultantly, "I have waited a long time for this."
He portrayed himself as a boy who grew up in a Boston housing project on welfare but rose in society because he had received a good public education. He said his mother had taught him that education "was a sledgehammer, that it could knock down any obstacle anyone put in front of me."
"I stand before you as someone who once received a welfare check, but because of education, I now sign every check issued by the State of New York," the comptroller said as the 353 delegates rose to give him an ovation. 
Mr. McCall described Mr. Pataki, the two-term Republican incumbent, as a do-nothing governor who had failed to solve a list of problems. The schools are crumbling and underfinanced, he charged. College tuition is too expensive. Too many jobs are leaving the state. The elderly cannot afford prescription drugs. The fund for cleaning toxic-waste sites is bankrupt.
He also derided Mr. Pataki for appearing in expensive public-service announcements that helped his image at a time when the schools need more money. "Prime-Time Pataki has misused hundreds of millions of our tax dollars, hundreds of millions of tax dollars, to cover the airwaves and cover up his failures," Mr. McCall said. 
"We've had enough of Prime-Time Pataki. It's time to change the channel," he added.
Mr. Cuomo began what he called a "people's campaign" by concentrating his fire not on Mr. McCall but on Mr. Pataki with the advertisements raising questions about the upstate economy. "We're going to tell the truth of what he did to upstate New York," Mr. Cuomo said in a news conference. "They abandoned upstate New York."
In one, Mr. Cuomo argues that upstate New York should share in the contracts arising from the rebuilding of downtown Manhattan. A second says, "Our children are leaving because right now the upstate economy is the slowest in the United States."
Mr. Cuomo unveiled the new advertisements at a campaign rally in which he bound his campaign with that of Charlie King, a candidate for lieutenant governor and a longtime friend of Mr. Cuomo's. He said he and Mr. King were running as a ticket. 
The step may have limited practical effect because there are separate primaries for governor and lieutenant governor, but it could mean political gain for Mr. Cuomo, a white candidate, because Mr. King is black.
Mr. Pataki's aides disputed the claims made by both Democrats, saying the governor had created jobs, given the schools financial support and protected the environment. "Carl McCall's partisan rhetoric will not change that," said the governor's spokeswoman, Mollie Fullington.
Ms. Fullington also challenged the assertion in Mr. Cuomo's advertisements that the upstate economy was the slowest in the nation. "Andy is playing fast and loose with the facts," she said.
In his convention address, Mr. McCall promised to add $8 billion to the state education budget in his first term if elected. In a nod to suburban and rural voters, he also promised to cut property taxes.
His speech seemed intended to draw a distinction between himself and Mr. Cuomo, the son of a former governor. Mr. McCall referred several times to his own rags-to-riches history, saying he "had to fight for everything I've ever gotten in life."
"My path to this stage, on this day, was not easy," Mr. McCall continued, "but it doesn't matter that I came from poverty. What matters is that I know the way to opportunity, and I am determined to create a state where every child has the same chance to succeed that I had."
As Mr. McCall basked in the delegates' applause, discontent grew among county party leaders who support Mr. Cuomo. Several said they had hoped to hear Mr. Cuomo speak at the convention, to take his measure as a candidate. Others said they felt abandoned after months of publicly supporting the former federal housing secretary even when the majority of party leaders were backing Mr. McCall.
"The negative fallout is significant," said Stuart Brody, the Essex County Democratic chairman, who is a strong supporter of Mr. Cuomo. 
Although Mr. McCall's campaign visibly gained ground yesterday, the designation of the convention may not be decisive. Mr. Cuomo is likely to collect enough signatures to get on the ballot, and in the past the candidate the convention has chosen often loses the primary, political consultants say.
By law, to get on the primary ballot, a candidate must either get a quarter of the weighted votes of the convention delegates, or collect thousands of signatures from around the state.
For weeks, it seemed a foregone conclusion that Mr. Cuomo would reach 25 percent, because party leaders who can swing large blocs of votes had said they would push him over that mark if he needed help. Those leaders -- top party officials, county chairmen, elected officials and, in particular, Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker -- had made similar moves in the past to ensure that well-known candidates reached the ballot.
A number of top Democrats said yesterday that it became clear on Monday that Mr. Cuomo could not get 25 percent on his own and that he had not sought help from party officials. 
Some of those same officials declined to discuss the matter Wednesday, but yesterday they said Mr. Cuomo had insulted them by characterizing the convention as a bosses' cabal removed from the people.
"He didn't have the numbers," said Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr., the state Democratic chairman. "There were messages sent, publicly and privately, that if he needed help, it would have been available, but he wouldn't ask. We didn't want to be the bad guy, we didn't want the party to be the bad guy, but that's exactly the spin he wants."
Mr. Cuomo said the party leaders were mistaken. He said he chose not to seek a vote at the convention to make a statement about his independence. 
"We had more than the 25 percent," he said. "I'm certain about that. But I don't want to do this through Democratic delegates. I want to do this with the people."

HEADLINE: McDonald's Growth Continues 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: OAK BROOK, Ill., May 23 

 BODY:
The McDonald's Corporation intends to continue opening new restaurants at a rapid pace, its chief executive said today, despite sluggish recent results that have prompted some analysts to question its ambitious strategy.
 More than half of the company's income now comes from 120 countries outside the United States, and the chief executive, Jack Greenberg, said that percentage would continue to grow in spite of economic difficulties in some regions. 
 He told shareholders at the annual meeting that the company remained on pace to open 1,300 to 1,400 McDonald's restaurants this year, all but 350 of them abroad.
That is similar to the 1,319 McDonald's restaurants that opened last year and down slightly from the previous year, and will push McDonald's, the world's biggest restaurant company, past the 30,000 mark.
"The opportunity outside the United States is just so enormous," Mr. Greenberg said after the session at company headquarters. While trimming operations in Latin America and some other areas, McDonald's is focusing on the most stable international markets.
The company has also cited plans to open 100 to 150 restaurants of its other, recently acquired, brands: Donatos pizza, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Boston Market and Pret a Manger. 
Only Boston Market is profitable so far, however, and Mr. Greenberg said the McDonald's brand "is still our largest and best growth opportunity."
While shareholders may be unhappy about McDonald's recent struggles, no one in the overflow crowd at the annual meeting voiced it. That may be because the long-slumping stock is up 15 percent this year.

Laughs to the Left, Laughs to the Right

BYLINE:  By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER 

 BODY:
Heaven only knows what sort of mischief and deviltry takes place at Congressional Christmas parties. But occasionally a hint of the goings-on has escaped in the form of "Capitol Steps," the irreverent show that traces its origins to the entertainment provided by a group of aides asked to enliven a Senate Foreign Relations Committee Christmas party in 1981.
 Now those irrepressible satirists, who bubble their way to New York every year or two, are puncturing the powerful with their latest scattershot onslaught of comedy, "Capitol Steps: When Bush Comes to Shove," playing through Aug. 31 at the John Houseman Theater. 
 Mostly political and highly topical, performed by a five-member cast backed by a keyboard, this fast-moving combination of skits and songs ranges from Washington to Kandahar and from Broadway to the Middle and Far East, as it forages for material. 
Although the quality ranges from side-splitting to simplistic, the show on the whole provides a happy evening for those who yearn for the lighter side of the news and derive pleasure from seeing the mighty made ridiculous.
Conforming to stereotype, here are the pretzel-loving President Bush as an amiable dope, and his wife, Laura, served up cloyingly sweet. In similar fashion, the comedy -- conceived, written and directed by Bill Strauss, Elaina Newport and Mark Eaton -- pokes fun at familiar figures like the Clintons; the chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan; the Israeli Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, and the Palestinian leader, Yasir Arafat; Vice President Dick Cheney; Senator Strom Thurmond; and Tom Ridge, director of homeland security, who reads bedtime stories, including a version of "Snow White" that dispatches its heroine into the remote lair of a bearded clan.
Casting a jaundiced eye on local heroes, the show zings Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg for his weekend disappearances with "Bye Bye Bloomberg," set to the music of "Bye Bye Blackbird"; in "On Broadway," the comics tell where to find the seamy New York that vanished when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani cleaned up the streets; and in "When You're a Met," music from "West Side Story" underscores the hostility between fans of the Mets and those of the Yankees.
The show reaches its pinnacle with two eruptions of "Lirty Dies," an outpouring of spoonerisms in each act. The first looks back at the 20th century, a time when Richard M. Nixon declared, "I am crot a nook," and Gush and Bore began their runs for the presidency. The second examines the pedophilia scandal involving the Roman Catholic Church.
Aided and abetted by plenty of wigs, beards and props, the versatile cast members draw on popular and show tunes as they set their sights on women in Congress, the Enron scandal, the economy, the far right, environmental issues, Microsoft, airport security, shoe bombers and other terrorists, pop stars, cloning and -- in another highlight -- relations with China.
Those who complain that politicians and government are good for nothing are wrong. "Capitol Steps: When Bush Comes to Shove" makes clear that more often than not, they're good for a laugh.

HEADLINE: Water Crisis Grows Into a Test of U.S.-Mexico Relations 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: GUERRERO VIEJO, Mexico, May 22 

 BODY:
Half a century ago this town was drowned. The United States and Mexico built a huge reservoir by damming the Rio Grande, under a treaty to divide the water of the mighty river.
 Now the ghost of Guerrero Viejo has risen. The reservoir, drained by drought, thirst, population growth and personal greed, holds one-twelfth of its capacity. The town, once deep under water, stands on dry land. On the water's edge, two miles away, horses and cattle graze on grasses that should be five fathoms under. 
 The treaty is falling apart, along with any pretense that the United States and Mexico are not on the verge of political war. The water-management policies of both nations for the border can best be described in three words: pray for rain.
Under the terms of the treaty, Mexico now owes the United States 456 billion gallons of water -- enough to quench the thirst of New York City for a year. The water should have flowed down the Rio Grande over the past decade, but didn't.
President Vicente Fox says he is preparing a plan to pay the debt back. Exactly how is a mystery.
"We can't pay it off, we don't have the water," said Enrique Martinez governor of the state of Coahuila, which borders Texas. He added a sober prognostication: "I think the struggle for water will be the gravest problem of this century."
This same struggle is simmering worldwide: rivers and reservoirs are running dry as a growing population fights over a shrinking source of life. The issue is testing the political friendship between Mr. Fox and President Bush, who knows it well from his days as Texas governor.
The two presidents discussed the debt twice in the past two months, once face to face at an economic summit meeting in Monterrey, Mexico, and again by telephone last week.
What started as a local dispute along the Rio Grande has turned into an international imbroglio, a question of national security for Mexico and a matter of survival for several million Texans and Mexicans. The crisis is shocking people on both sides of the border into seeing that there may be limits to growth.
In the Rio Grande valley, where the population has gone from 200,000 to 20 million since the water treaty was signed in 1944, the United States and Mexico "have been promoting growth" -- industrial and agricultural -- "as if there were no limit," said Alberto Szekely, Mexico's national water secretary. "And water is one," he said. 
"Both sides were warned long ago that something like this would happen," he said. "But they were working on free trade and avoiding political issues like this." Water policy on both sides of the border, he said, has been marked by negligence and wishful thinking.
One-third of the water that flows to the Rio Grande above the Falcon dam is supposed to go to south Texas, and the remainder to Mexicans downriver. But with rivers and reservoirs at record lows, people on both sides of the border, dependent on the water for drinking and irrigation, fear their fields and towns will dry up and blow away.
 South Texas farmers, who have taken their case to the State Department, blockaded the border at the Pharr international trade bridge today in protest, demanding that Mexico pay back the water. Jo Jo White, the manager of one of the largest irrigation districts in the Texas border region, joined the protest.
"In 30 to 60 days we'll be out of water if Mexico doesn't comply," Mr. White, who manages irrigation for 300 farmers and 60,000 acres, said in a telephone interview. "The crops in the ground will be lost. The growers, who have been living on the edge -- it'll be the nail in the coffin for them." Mexico has "shorted us, and they shorted their own growers twice as much," he said. "This is not only an American problem." 
The Mexican farmers near the river are petitioning President Fox to resolve the debt, run up by two past presidents, without destroying their parched lives.
"We really are out of water," said Juan Luis Zapata, a sorghum farmer wearing a New York Yankees baseball cap, in the town of Camargo, 35 miles downriver from the Falcon reservoir. "The government hasn't managed the water for the benefit of the people. Water has always been used as a kind of political power."
In Texas and in Mexico's Tamaulipas State, where Mr. Zapata lives, the farmers point upriver to the state of Chihuahua, where they claim officials are hoarding billions of gallons.
"We don't have any water," Patricio Martinez, the combative governor of Chihuahua, says flatly. He has defied both Mr. Fox and many American visitors, including Mr. White, by saying that his state's waters are sovereign -- treaty or no treaty. "The harsh truth is that drought is a fact of life in northern Mexico and the southwestern United States," he said.
President Fox says Mexico, which has less water per capita than Egypt, has spent decades squandering what it has, "without planning, without sense."
To help him pay his old debt, Mr. Fox has asked the United States to let him take on a new one. In order to build a water system that does not waste half its flow through leakage and evaporation, Mr. Fox has asked Mr. Bush to loan Mexico about $420 million, or something less than a penny of financing for every 10 gallons owed.
This idea has infuriated the Texans, who see the request as blackmail. Governor Rick Perry, who succeeded Mr. Bush, has urged the president to not loan Mexico a dime until the debt is paid.
"We feel abandoned by a home-grown president who knew what was happening all along," Mr. White, the Texas farmer, said.
Mr. Fox's advisers fear that the United States will not agree to bargain with them on immigration and economic issues unless the debt is paid. The water issue has thus become a major point of discord in relations between two nations that seemed in exceptional harmony during Mr. Bush's first months in office.
In Mexico's Congress the opposition Institutional Revolutionary Party, which ran Mexico for seven decades until Mr. Fox's election, is skeptical of his promise to make good on the water debt.
"The water the U.S. is demanding doesn't exist," said Silvia Hernandez, head of the Senate committee on North American relations. "The plan won't work."
But back in Camargo, Mr. Zapata wipes the sweat from his brow, surveys his stunted sorghum with a weary gaze, and says there is no choice for Mexico.
"Look, this is an international treaty -- we signed it," he said. "But without our own water, every day, every year, we will keep going backward until we're gone."
There is only one alternative, he said: "Pray to San Isidro," the patron saint of farmers, to make it rain.

HEADLINE: Bill for Emergency Spending Bogs Down in Partisan Rancor 

BYLINE:  By ALISON MITCHELL 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23 

 BODY:
A $29.4 billion emergency spending bill for military operations and domestic security was caught up in a partisan firestorm in the House today, and the result was a session that headed deep into the night as Democrats dragged out debate in a dispute over the national debt.
 The legislation, including money for the war in Afghanistan, airline security, counterterrorism and New York City's recovery, became a vehicle for both parties to showcase campaign themes. For a second day, debate was testy, punctuated with partisan applause. 
 The Democratic minority used maneuver after maneuver to keep debate running for hours in protest of House leaders' rolling political favors for various Republicans into the bill, along with language that would pave the way to raise the limit on the federal debt without a politically painful separate vote. 
Striking a central campaign theme, Democrats repeatedly accused Republicans of trying to escape accountability for their own fiscal policies.
The Democrats blamed President Bush's 10-year, $1.3 trillion tax cut for helping bring the Treasury Department up against the $5.95 trillion debt limit, which the administration seeks to raise by $750 billion. They said new federal deficits and borrowing would threaten the long-term solvency of Social Security. 
Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House minority leader, said the Republicans "want to get the political credit for cutting people's taxes" but "don't want the part that they don't want to address, which is you have got to raise the credit limit on our credit card in order to give the tax cut to the wealthiest Americans."
The Republicans, meanwhile, accused Democrats of turning their backs on the nation's fighting forces. 
"American soldiers are dying, unfortunately," said Representative C. W. Bill Young, the Florida Republican who heads the House Appropriations Committee. "We are going to move this bill to completion."
In the Democratic-controlled Senate, which has its own $31 billion version of the emergency bill, the tactics were reversed today. There it was the Republicans who sought delay.
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader, tried to bring the bill to the floor for 10 hours of debate, reminding lawmakers that Mr. Bush had once said he wanted it passed by Memorial Day.
But Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, instantly objected, complaining of political pork in the bill. Mr. McCain said he had found one provision that would help the halibut fishing industry in Alaska with loan authority, and spoke sarcastically of "an emergency for halibuts." 
"It's disgraceful," he said. "We're going to change the way we do business around here."
Democratic Senate aides quickly told reporters that the provision was actually part of the president's budget request and was a technical correction to existing law.
The battles over an antiterrorism measure, just days after the administration had issued a series of warnings about the likelihood of future terrorist attacks, were a sign of the hardening partisanship as the elections draw closer, with control of the House and the Senate in the balance.
A number of major bills are now caught in disputes between the Senate and House, including further tax cuts, an effort to regulate health maintenance organizations and energy legislation. The Senate did manage to give final Congressional passage today to a $3 billion measure to help defend against bioterrorism.
Republicans accuse the Senate of obstructing Mr. Bush's agenda and are calling on Americans to restore them to the Senate majority as a way of supporting him. The Republican National Committee today e-mailed out a "Daschle One-Year Performance Review," rating the senator "unsatisfactory."
Senate Democrats, on the other hand, say they have stopped "extreme" Republican measures like further tax cuts for corporations and oil drilling in an Alaskan wildlife refuge.
"Some people call our refusal to rubber-stamp the Republican agenda obstruction," Mr. Daschle said at a rally today. "I see it as rejecting failed ideas in the name of real solutions. And I call that progress. "
Eager to leave for Memorial Day, House Republican leaders began taking action tonight to force a final vote on the emergency measure sometime before dawn. Both parties say the bill, which includes $5.5 billion for New York, will eventually pass the House.

HEADLINE: Senate Approves Bill Giving Wider Trade Authority to Bush 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23 

 BODY:
The Senate tonight passed a broad trade bill that would give President Bush the authority to reach trade agreements that are largely immune from Congressional tinkering but would greatly increase aid to workers who lose their jobs because of foreign competition.
 The 66-to-30 vote brought the White House close to a top legislative priority that administration officials say will make it easier to expand trade, allowing Mr. Bush to reach trade accords that Congress could accept or reject, but not amend. 
 The Senate's lopsided approval followed razor-thin passage of trade authority in the House late last year, the first time in eight years that both houses of Congress have agreed to grant the White House the enhanced negotiating powers. 
That handed Mr. Bush a significant victory at a time when the administration has angered major allies abroad and free-trade conservatives at home by slapping punitive duties on imported steel and supporting huge subsidies for farmers.
The 41 Republicans who voted for the bill were joined by 24 Democrats and one independent. Five Republicans and 25 Democrats opposed it.
House and Senate negotiators now must try to reconcile substantially different versions of the bill in negotiations that will pit Democratic demands for more worker protections against Republican preferences to limit costly welfare provisions.
The compromise to grant Mr. Bush so-called trade promotion authority won the support of the Senate Democratic leadership only after weeks of partisan haggling. It would triple the money spent on aid for displaced workers to $1.2 billion annually. The government would also begin paying 70 percent of the health insurance costs for people whose jobs disappear because of imports.
"Senators realize that we cannot stick our heads in the sand and that we need to deal with globalization," said Senator Max Baucus, a Montana Democrat and a main sponsor of the bill. "But we also insisted that the benefits of trade go to workers and not just to companies."
Mr. Bush agreed to support increased aid as the price of restoring trade authority. Five presidents have had the enhanced negotiating rights, but the powers expired in 1994 and Congress repeatedly denied them to President Bill Clinton.
Robert B. Zoellick, Mr. Bush's chief trade negotiator, said today that the trade authority "will provide the administration with the tools to pry open markets and negotiate the best deals for our workers, farmers, and consumers."
Mr. Bush wants to use the authority to create the world's largest free trade zone by expanding the North American Free Trade Agreement to 31 additional countries, mostly in Latin America, by the end of his first term. By that time the administration also aims to conclude a global negotiation to liberalize trade that began late last year in Doha, Qatar.
But the bill still faces obstacles. Administration officials say Mr. Bush cannot sign the measure if it includes a Senate provision that would bar changes in American antidumping laws. The restrictions are a slap at the administration after it agreed to discuss the laws, which allow countries to retaliate against low-priced imports, in Doha.
Administration officials say they will be hard pressed to reach trade accords if Congress unilaterally takes some sensitive issues off the table. Many countries have demanded that agreements address disparities in the way nations use domestic trade laws to block imports.
The trade bill passed by the Republican-led House in December did not authorize extensive new aid for workers and it did not bar Mr. Bush from negotiating antidumping rules. 
Supporters say they are optimistic that the strong Senate vote paved the way to complete work on the bill.
"There is no doubt now that we're going to get this to the president," said Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa.
Opponents say they expect a grueling rematch in the House, where the trade measure passed by a single vote in December and where both Democrats and Republicans had hoped to avoid a second vote close to Congressional elections.
Though the margin of victory in the Senate proved heartening to the administration, the Senate has historically supported trade with far less hesitation. The prolonged wrangling over the bill indicated growing reluctance to support trade accords among Democrats and Republicans who represent districts with large numbers of blue collar workers.
Even the Bush administration, which entered office vowing to promote trade around the world, has used protectionist measures to help steel, farm, timber and textile industries more readily than the Clinton administration did. That has created a backlash among trading partners, some analysts say.
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the majority leader, demanded a high price for pushing the bill through the Senate by insisting on extensive worker unemployment and health benefits that have not often been part of trade bills.
Republicans protested what they considered a Democratic effort to turn a relatively small trade-related program that supports retraining of workers who lose jobs to foreign competitors into a vehicle for wider health care coverage and large increases in unemployment benefits.
The bill would provide benefits to many workers indirectly affected by trade, like those who supply parts to a company that closes because of foreign competition.
Welfare provisions in the Senate bill may help the Bush administration round up a few more Democrats in the House. But they could also cost votes among free trade Republicans.
In sign of the battle to come, House Democrats have begun a drive to keep the Senate bill intact and to demand more trade concessions from the administration before the measure comes before the House.
Representative Robert T. Matsui of California, a Democrat who is often considered a bellwether on trade measures, said trade accords these days were no longer just about tariffs but also about domestic policies, like antidumping and antitrust laws. He said the administration needed to give Congress a more hands-on oversight role.
"We can't agree to allow negotiations about domestic law and regulations that Congress doesn't have the power to change," Mr. Matsui said.

HEADLINE: City Wants Stock Exchange To Invest More for Complex 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
The Bloomberg administration has asked the New York Stock Exchange to double its investment, to $900 million, in a plan for a heavily subsidized trading complex that former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani once called a "Christmas gift to the city." 
 The Bloomberg administration views the proposed project, which could cost taxpayers more than $1 billion in cash and tax breaks, as too expensive, especially in light of the city's sluggish economy and a multibillion dollar budget gap. 
 Both sides have problems with the three-year-old deal to build a modern trading complex and 50-story tower across the street from the exchange's home on Wall Street. But neither the city nor Richard A. Grasso, chairman of the exchange, wants to be accused of scuttling the project, when the city's financial district is still coping with layoffs, corporate relocations and the destruction of the World Trade Center. 
At a meeting with top executives of the exchange on May 16, the deputy mayor for economic development, Daniel Doctoroff, proposed that the exchange raise its contribution to the project, to as much as $900 million, from about $450 million, according to one person who was there and another who was briefed on the talks. 
"What may have been a bad deal three years ago is now untenable," said Harvey Robins, a former city director of operations and a critic of the project. "The question is whether the financial community recognizes that the world has changed and that the mayor's call for shared sacrifice is a message that clearly applies to them." 
But the Bloomberg administration does not expect all the money to come from the pockets of the exchange. As part of the proposal, Mr. Doctoroff suggested that the exchange apply for a wide range of federal incentives for the reconstruction of Lower Manhattan, including tax-free Liberty Bonds, accelerated depreciation and cash grants. Mr. Doctoroff declined comment, as did Ray Pellecchia, a spokesman for the exchange. 
Under the 1998 deal with the Giuliani administration, the city committed to buying the block bound by Wall, Broad and William Streets and Exchange Place, at an estimated cost of $450 million. The city and state also agreed to provide subsidies to build a 10-story building of trading floors: $225 million in cash from the state, $255 million from the city and $160 million in tax breaks. The city had initially planned to sell the development rights to a 50-story tower over the trading complex to offset the cost of the land. But after the attack on the trade center in September, Mr. Grasso declared that "a 900-foot tower post-Sept. 11 is not a salable transaction." He has since backed away from his objection to the tower, city and state officials said, but he remains concerned about security. The fate of the tower is unclear. 
With the yawning gap in the next city budget estimated at more than $5 billion, the city wants to reduce its obligations to the project. The state, which is also facing fiscal problems, recently assured Mr. Grasso that it remained committed to providing $225 million. The city has asked the exchange to add to the $450 million it had pledged to spend on construction and outfitting the trading complex. 
The new proposal delighted urban planners, budget watchdogs and even some investment bankers who have long criticized the size of the subsidies for the project. They have also questioned the need for an expensive trading complex with the advent of electronic trading. "It's a relief that they're trying to restructure the deal," said Diana Fortuna, president of the Citizens Budget Commission. "I would think some of the federal aid ought to help." 
Mr. Grasso did not attend the meeting a week ago and has not revealed his reaction to the new proposal from the Bloomberg administration. 
The project has already cost millions of dollars. And the city, which is paying $3 million a month to hold onto the land for the project, has agreed to pay $160 million for an apartment building on the site, owned by the Rockrose Development Corporation, and made a $22 million down payment on the $220 million purchase of an office building at 23 Wall Street from J. P. Morgan Chase. 
Despite the deposit, J. P. Morgan Chase demanded that the city pay $2 million a month in penalties because the acquisition did not close as expected last December.

Bush, in Berlin, Equates Terror and Totalitarianism
President Bush told Germany's Parliament that terror groups constitute a "new totalitarian threat" and, in a clear reference to Hitler, he compared the current struggle against such groups to a past generation's battle against those who "killed in the name of racial purity." A1

Mr. Bush arrived in Moscow for a three-day visit to Russia that both sides have cast as the final eulogy to the cold war. A12

Assessing Military Readiness
A top-secret, computer-simulated Pentagon war game has revealed that expanding the campaign against terrorism to a country like Iraq would put severe strains on personnel and cause deep shortages of certain critical weapons, senior officials say. Even so, the exercise found that the armed forces could wage and win a major regional conflict while maintaining other global commitments. A8

Pakistan to Move Troops
Pakistan is preparing to shift troops from the border with Afghanistan, where they are engaged in the hunt for Al Qaeda and Taliban fighters, to the front in Kashmir, where tensions with India are quickly rising, the government announced. A1

Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee of India held a meeting with senior military commanders in Kashmir and appeared to vacillate in his public statements over whether India would immediately strike at Pakistan. A10

Bomb Attacks in Israel
A remote-controlled bomb blew apart a tanker truck at Israel's biggest fuel depot, but an automatic sprinkler system and nearby workers quickly put out the blaze, which was in a densely populated area near Tel Aviv. And early today, a man tried to ram a car filled with explosives into a Tel Aviv nightclub, but officials told Reuters that a security guard shot him and the car exploded before it hit the club. A8

The F.B.I. director, Robert S. Mueller III, ordered an inquiry into complaints by a senior agent in Minneapolis that officials in Washington had repeatedly held back investigators in Minneapolis who sought to investigate Zacarias Moussaoui aggressively in the days before Sept. 11. Mr. Moussaoui is accused of participating in the hijacking plot. A1

Classified documents show that a material witness told F.B.I. agents shortly before they arrested Mr. Moussaoui that Mr. Moussaoui believed it was "acceptable to kill civilians who harm Muslims" and approved of Muslims who died as "martyrs" in such attacks. A1

Court documents in Boston say there is evidence that Richard Colvin Reid did not act alone in trying to blow up a flight with explosives in his shoes. A22

Senators neared agreement on changes in the Sept. 11 Victims Compensation Fund that would let many American families from past terror attacks receive compensation. A22

Biowarfare Tests on Ships
The Defense Department sprayed live nerve and biological agents on ships and sailors during cold war-era experiments to test the Navy's vulnerability to toxic warfare, the Pentagon disclosed. A1
