HEADLINE: Success Arrives, With Plenty of Confetti

 BODY:
YOU might say that Stephanie Mack's company is part of a motorized cavalry in the war against identity theft. 
 You can surely say that it is on the front lines of the campaign to protect personal privacy.
Ms. Mack, a former registered nurse and hospital administrator, is the founder and president of Just-N-Time Dynamics, a Bronx company that is in the document destruction business, which has grown sharply in recent years. Companies like Ms. Mack's are paid to shred large volumes of paper that enterprises like doctors' offices, hospitals, banks, investment firms and insurance companies no longer need or find redundant, but cannot simply dump into the trash because the papers include personal information about patients and customers. 
 In fact, failing to destroy the documents would violate a string of federal privacy laws passed in the last decade -- laws that have been a major factor in the growth of the shredding business. 
 While many companies in the business haul documents to their own sites for shredding, many others, including Just-N-Time, send truck-mounted mobile shredders to their clients' locations, where the papers are sliced apart. 
 ''We're talking about an 800-pound industrial shredder that can shred over 1,000 pounds of documents an hour,'' Ms. Mack said, describing a machine bolted into her company's 26-foot-long truck. She sells the shredded material to a paper recycling company.
 Just-N-Time is one of 1,500 to 2,000 companies estimated to be offering document shredding services in the United States, according to Robert Johnson, executive director of the National Association for Information Destruction, a trade group in Phoenix. ''When I got into this business in 1981, there were a few hundred,'' he said.
 The greatest growth has come in the last few years, he said, because of the federal privacy laws enacted since the middle 1990's. They require medical professionals and institutions to protect patient information, and banks, securities firms, insurance companies and other businesses to safeguard customers' personal and financial information.
 The shredding business is not regulated by the federal government or by any state or local agencies, Mr. Johnson said. Some people in the business have expressed concern that the lack of regulation raises the possibility of slipshod work or infiltration by identity thieves. Mr. Johnson said that his group, whose 700 member companies in the United States include 85 in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, would welcome regulation, but believes it would be hard to bring about. 
 The association has a voluntary program that awards certification to members who permit security professionals to audit their operations, including their employment screening procedures. 
 Two types of companies are engaged in the business, Mr. Johnson said: those whose sole or primary activity is document destruction, and those that have added it to their main operations, like paper recycling or records storage. Aside from several companies with many shredding operations across the country, those in the business are typically ''small, local-market, owner-operated,'' he said. 
 Which describes Just-N-Time Dynamics. At her office recently in Hunts Point in the Bronx, Ms. Mack said she had worked as a nurse for five years and then in hospital administration for 25 years before starting the company in 2001. 
 ''I always wanted to go into business for myself,'' she said, adding that her hospital work made her keenly aware of the burden of disposing of records in compliance with privacy laws -- and of the business opportunity in helping to bear that burden.
 After drawing up a business plan with help from the Bronx branch of the New York State Small Business Development Center, Ms. Mack bought her mobile shredder and hired an employee to operate it.
 Total start-up costs were about $200,000, mostly from her savings, she said. She has sought business from hospitals, insurance and mortgage companies, lawyers' offices, accountants and auto dealerships, which also gather a lot of personal information about customers.
 Business was slow at first, and revenue reached $50,000 in 2003, Ms. Mack said. But she said business had accelerated, with revenue doubling in 2004 and doubling again last year. 
 ''We're on track'' for a similar increase this year, she said. As a result, she said, she's optimistic enough about the future that ''I plan to acquire a second mobile unit toward the end of the year.''

HEADLINE: Chameleon Mao, the Face of Tiananmen Square

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA

DATELINE: Shanghai 

 BODY:
FEW images created in the last century are as recognizable as the official portrait of Mao that looms over Tiananmen Square in Beijing.
 For decades, the 15-by-20-foot oil painting has served as a national icon. This is the same image that, in the 1960's and 70's, was widely reproduced and hung near the entrances to millions of homes, schools, factories and government buildings. During the Cultural Revolution, when Mao was raised to cult status, it seemed as if the entire nation had set about drawing a Mao portrait, or at least honoring one. If Mao's Little Red Book was the national bible, Mao's official portrait was the national stamp.
And while people in China seem to have lost some affection for Mao, and even protested in 1989 by splattering his Tiananmen portrait with paint, his image still represents something indelible and intangible, experts say.
 ''This is the most important painting in China,'' said Wu Hung, an art historian at the University of Chicago. ''This is not an artistic judgment. But look at how many people have seen this image over the last century.'' 
 Mao's image may also be considered China's first and only global brand. Even though China is a rising economic power, it still does not have a BMW or a Coca-Cola to sell to the rest of the world. 
 But it does have Mao -- a kind of George Washington, James Dean and Che Guevara wrapped in one; a historic and pop figure who continues to be hip and fashionable, even when Communism and the Communist Party are not.
 And so it is no surprise that a firestorm erupted in China a little over a week ago after a state-controlled Beijing auction house wheeled out an old official portrait of Mao, owned by a Chinese-American, and said it would sell the piece to the highest bidder on June 3.
 The Huachen Auction Company said the small portrait, dating from the 1950's or 60's, was painted by Zhang Zhenshi, one of Mao's first official portrait makers and the artist credited with the model for the painting that hangs in Tiananmen Square.
 After critics on the Internet in China lashed out at the planned sale, Huachen withdrew the item, saying the government had intervened and ''suggested'' the work be placed in a national museum.
 But the controversy raised some intriguing questions. Who actually painted Mao's official portrait? And why is it still up in the square, when many Chinese seem more eager to buy Gucci bags than Mao suits?
 Some of the answers can be found in Professor Wu's book ''Remaking Beijing,'' which says Mao's image, like the socialist state, was actually created by committee. 
 Nor was it the first such portrait to hang in Beijing. A large one of Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Chinese Republic, was raised in the square after his death in 1925. And the image of Chiang Kai-shek, the Nationalist leader, was hung there in 1945. 
 Mao's portrait appeared in 1949, after the Communists assumed power. First, a hastily sketched portrait was hung in February. Then, on Oct. 1, when Mao declared the founding of the People's Republic of China from the rostrum at Tiananmen Gate, an official portrait, based on a photograph, showed Mao wearing an octagonal cap and coarse woolen jacket.
 The cap-wearing Mao didn't last long. A year later, 30 artists were asked to create a new image, and Mr. Zhang, a teacher at the Beijing Art Institute, was named official portrait maker.
 From 1950 to about 1964, Mr. Zhang painted Mao's Tiananmen portrait, based on official photographs, often with the help of artists who were supposed to be anonymous.
 The portrait evolved over time. Mao in an army cap gave way to Mao's sideways glance, which was replaced by the now standard Mao frontal pose, with his eyes peering directly at viewers. An early piece was criticized because Mao appeared to be looking away from -- possibly ignoring -- the masses. 
 Historians say that in the 1950's or 60's Mr. Zhang created the standard image, based on a photograph of Mao in his trademark gray suit. And by 1967, when the Cultural Revolution was under way, a final tweak had been added: the painting showed both of Mao's ears, rather than just one, proof that he was listening to all the people and not just a select few. 
 The artists, Mr. Wu said, were not supposed to be creative, but merely render the image from carefully selected photographs. ''If you emphasized the artist, then it would be a work of art,'' Professor Wu said. ''That was not the intention.''
 Over the years, the painted Mao has aged, appeared grim, taken on a fatherly look, and even shown a faint smile. At some point the shadow on his face was reduced.
 Since 1949 there have only been four official portrait artists but many unofficial contributors, like Wang Qizhi, now in his late 70's, who said in an interview last week that he had worked for over 20 years on Mao's portraits, leaving few records.
 ''The old canvas was reused by putting on white paint to cover the previous painting,'' Mr. Wang said. ''One piece of canvas was used five or six times. When it became too thick to paint, people pulled off the canvas and put on a new one.''
 Apparently, Mao's colorful oil portrait came down only once, briefly, after his death in 1976, when it was replaced by a huge black and white photograph, a sign of mourning. Why hasn't the image come down since? Some believe that such a move would signal the demise of the party. Others say the portrait is a cultural relic.
 ''It's a very complex image,'' said Professor Wu, who grew up near Beijing. ''It has different meanings to different people. To the party, it symbolizes the party and the nation's founding. But to a lot of people it symbolizes China, or it has very personal memories.''
 That is one reason Mao's official image has changed mostly in subtle ways. Beyond Tiananmen Square, however, artists have experimented more freely, and after Mao's death, some played with his once-sacred image. Wang Keping attracted international attention in 1979 by carving a wooden image of a Buddha-faced Mao called ''Idol.'' In the 1980's, Wang Guangyi dissected Mao by putting him behind bars, or a large grid. Li Shan put a flower and lipstick on him; Gao Qiang made him look sickly, swimming in a blood-red Yangtze River.
 But Mao's defenders are never far behind. Mr. Zhang's model Mao is no longer up for auction, thanks to government intervention. And several weeks ago, when Mr. Gao's sickly Mao was raised in an exhibition space in Beijing 's trendy Dashanzi area, the police showed up. They had the image removed. Officially, there's still only one Mao, and he's still the national icon.


GRAPHIC: Photos: Cultural Evolution -- The first official portrait of Mao to hang in Tiananmen Square, top left, lasted barely a year. Next, he appeared hatless and gazing out into the distance. Too distant, apparently, so a later portrait had him looking at his viewers. That portrait was adapted periodically, resulting in the current one, in which Mao faces full forward, both ears in evidence. (Photos by top right, ''Remaking Beijing,'' Wu Hung

HEADLINE: When It Comes to Alternate Fuels, All Gallons Aren't Equal

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
SOME drivers who fill their cars with gasoline this summer may find themselves traveling fewer miles on a tankful than they did last summer. Their gas tanks did not shrink, and it's not a year's wear and tear cutting into the mileage. 
 The difference is the fuel -- it may have less energy in it. 
The reason is that some refiners are adding ethanol -- up to 10 percent by volume -- as an octane booster. A gallon of ethanol has only about two-thirds as much energy as a gallon of gasoline. Because fuel for cars is sold by the gallon -- that is, by volume and not by energy content -- an engine needs to burn more of a lower-energy fuel to do the same work. 
 Until recently, drivers paid little attention to such calculations. But with the price of oil near $70 a barrel, there is new interest in alternative fuels. The differences in energy content, and thus mileage, can be readily measured, as reflected in the fuel economy ratings listed by the federal Environmental Protection Agency for flexible-fuel cars and trucks. These vehicles are designed to run on fuels ranging from 100 percent gasoline to E85, an ethanol blend that contains just 15 percent gas.
 For example, a 2006 Dodge Ram pickup with a 4.7-liter flexible-fuel V-8 engine will return 12 miles a gallon in the city and 15 on the highway using gasoline, according to the E.P.A. On E85 ethanol, the economy drops to 9 m.p.g. in town and 11 on the highway. Ethanol would have to be about 25 percent cheaper than gasoline -- this has not been the case recently -- for the dollars-per-mile costs to be equal.
 Certainly there are other considerations facing consumers, including oil imports and air pollution. And in fairness, the flexible-fuel vehicles sold today are not engineered to squeeze the most from every gallon of high-octane E85, which would run more efficiently using an engine built for higher operating pressures. 
 To provide a common measure for the energy values of different fuels, engineers use the British thermal unit, or B.T.U., which is the amount of heat needed to raise the temperature of a pound of water by 1 degree Fahrenheit. The Department of Energy gives a definition that is a bit less abstract: a B.T.U. is the approximate amount of energy released by striking a match. 
 Gasoline has about 115,000 B.T.U.'s per gallon depending on the season and the refinery, according to the Argonne National Laboratory, a federal science and engineering lab in Illinois. Gasohol, which is 10 percent ethanol and 90 percent unleaded regular (and the highest level of alcohol that regular cars will tolerate), has about 3 percent less energy, because 10 percent of the volume has one-third fewer B.T.U.'s. 
 Millions of flexible-fuel vehicles on American roads can run on E85, which is sold at a few hundred pumps around the country, mostly in the Midwest. It has some 83,000 B.T.U.'s, about 70 percent as much as gasoline. When gasohol and E85 cost less per gallon than gasoline, they may be good choices for a fill-up on the way to return a rental car at the airport; they may not be good choices otherwise. 
 ''Consumers should pay attention by observing the performance of their vehicles,'' said Lawrence Goldstein, the president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, a trade group in New York. 
 He also advocates buying B.T.U.'s as cheaply as possible, which means not using midgrade or premium gasoline unless the car requires it. Some cars can get more work out of a gallon of premium or midgrade fuel, because they burn fuel at higher temperatures, by squeezing the fuel-air mixture together more tightly before exploding it. 
 Another alternative to gasoline that is getting renewed attention is diesel fuel, which delivers far more miles per gallon, and in recent weeks has sold for nearly the same price. From the consumer's point of view, the math is simple: diesel delivers more miles per dollar. 
 But there is a catch here, too: diesel has more B.T.U.'s per gallon than gasoline, about 128,000.
 Diesel vehicles can go about one-third farther on a gallon, but on a global basis the gain is not as great as it might seem. That is because fewer gallons of diesel fuel than of gasoline can be produced from a barrel of crude oil. This is important because diesel output is limited; refineries, typically geared toward producing gasoline, would have to be rebuilt to make more diesel. To meet the higher demand for diesel, European refineries will produce a surplus of gasoline, which they will export to the United States. 
 Gene Tunison, manager of fuels development at ExxonMobil Refining and Supply, speaking at a meeting of the Society of Automotive Engineers in Washington this month, said that his company projected a growth in diesel demand of 1.5 percent a year in Europe, and ''that's impossible to accommodate in a refinery.'' 
 Lee Schipper, director of the World Resources Institute for Transport and the Environment, pointed out that for a diesel car to deliver the same acceleration as a gasoline model, the engine has to be bigger. More reliance on diesel would mean big changes to refineries and service stations.
 There is more room for improved fuel efficiency with gasoline engines than with diesels, he said, questioning whether a switch would be worthwhile. According to the E.P.A., less than 15 percent of the energy that goes into the tank as gasoline is actually used to move the car.
 More new fuels are coming, though, and some resemble today's diesel. The Energy Information Administration, the statistical arm of the Energy Department, reacted to the recent run-up in oil prices by changing its prediction of the sources of transportation fuel in 2025. It now expects 600,000 barrels a day of liquids made from coal, to be mixed in with diesel fuel. This ''synthetic diesel'' has an energy content close to gasoline, about 15 percent less than diesel.


GRAPHIC: Chart/Photos: ''Dollars Per Trip, Not Miles Per Gallon''Drivers typically judge driving costs by comparing the price of fuel in dollars per gallon. But because fuels contain different levels of energy, and some types of engines use fuel more efficiently than others, it makes sense to compare the distance traveled for each dollar spent. Here are three 2006 models sold with a choice of fuel types (and their city/highway mileage ratings), and the cost to drive each of them 25 miles as calculated by the Environmental Protection Agency:HONDA CIVICGasoline (30/40 m.p.g.) -- $2.12Natural Gas (28/39) -- $0.98DODGE RAM 1500Gasoline (12/15) -- $5.54E85 Ethanol (9/11) -- $6.02VOLKSWAGEN JETTAGasoline (25/31) -- $2.76Diesel (35/42) -- $1.90Chart/Diagram: ''Turning Up the Volume''Gasoline, E85 ethanol and diesel fuel have different amounts of energy in each gallon, as measured in B.T.U.'s. Effectively, this means that a vehicle needs to burn more ethanol than gasoline (but less diesel) to travel the same distance.GASOLINE115,000 B.T.U.'s/gallon=E85 ETHANOL83,000 B.T.U.'s/gallon=DIESEL128,000 B.T.U.'s/gallon

HEADLINE: All You Need Is Love (and Money)

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 David Brooks says that much of the inequality between rich and poor can be explained by love, and that economically successful children are more likely to come from stable, loving families, while poor children, raised mainly by single parents, lack sufficient love-providing adults. 
 Yet much of the literature on poverty indicates that single parents are just as likely to provide a loving relationship for their children as are rich, intact parents. 
 Indeed, poorer children are often exposed to far more extended family relationships than are the children of privileged households, who live from one activity to another. 
 But the major difference is that poor children need much greater institutional support. Poor, hard-working single parents too often lack access to quality child care, preschool programs, education, after-school programs, health care, affordable housing and a living wage.
 It's a lot easier to keep cutting taxes on the wealthy if we believe that to become successful, poor children mainly need more love.

HEADLINE: An Arts Festival Invites New Orleans to the Northeast

BYLINE: By JANE GORDON

 BODY:
EACH year, the International Festival of Arts and Ideas focuses on bringing hundreds of artists from throughout the world to New Haven for about two weeks to dance, sing, perform and display their works. This year, with a new director, the theme grew more specific: Reach out to New Orleans and the artists affected by Hurricane Katrina.
 So New Orleans, with its distinct flavors and sounds, will be descending on New Haven on June 10 through 24. 
New Orleans artists such as Cherice Harrison-Nelson of the group Guardians of the Flame had to set off to find work once Katrina hit.
 ''We are all trying to generate income because a lot of the work that we had lined up we weren't able to do because of the devastation here due to Katrina,'' said Ms. Harrison-Nelson, a member of the Mardi Gras Indian tribe. ''The New Haven festival's producers have been just wonderful in trying to understand what we're going through down here. The outpouring of love that has been extended to us has been a joy for everyone connected to the group.''
 Mary Lou Aleskie, the festival's executive director, said that as much as Katrina was a disaster to New Orleans, its aftermath has started to create a cultural diaspora that has forced Louisiana artists to take their work and culture to the rest of the country. 
 This year's festival will be the first directed by Ms. Aleskie, who started her job last September. She did so without the benefit of any fund-raising efforts or programming plans, but decided to go beyond the standard programming. 
 ''I was moving here in September as Katrina was unfolding, so it was pretty easy for me to envision a new haven for New Orleans as part of this festival,'' said Ms. Aleskie, who moved here from California. ''Now we have an opportunity to embrace this culture and reinforce it. It's a positive force if we can get behind it.''
 Mixing cultures has been a theme of the festival, which was created by Anne Tyler Calabresi, the wife of Guido Calabresi, a judge on the federal Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 Mrs. Calabresi was living in the New Haven suburb of Woodbridge in the 1980's when she became involved in the Leadership, Education, Athletics in Partnership program for children in New Haven. During her time there, she coordinated youth track teams that ran through New Haven's neighborhoods. 
 ''Everyone says the 'hood is terrible, but it isn't,'' Mrs. Calabresi said. ''It's where people are. I'm tired of the segregation we're suffering in our suburban, urban lives, and when people are having fun, they're generally very tolerant.''
 She had no idea how to begin and sought help from a friend, Jean Handley, who had just left the Southern New England Telephone Company as a vice president to found her own communications consulting firm.
 ''It's been great to see something that started as a germ of an idea actually catch hold and be as successful as it's been,'' Ms. Handley said. ''I think we accomplished our original objectives: One was to help regenerate the downtown center of New Haven and bring it alive once again, and the other was to celebrate community and bring people together.''
 Mrs. Calabresi said that many people ''thought we were absolutely crazy'' to take on the project.
 ''But it was a miraculous event,'' she said. ''We spent a lot of time trying to get the community to participate, to bring the world to New Haven, and to bring us all together.'' 
 They opened their first festival in 1995. It now attracts about 100,000 people, who spend about $15 million each season. The majority of the participants spend their time on the city green, where dozens of events are held, and where this year a Village of Villages will bring together Connecticut and regional artists to display their work. 
 The Village of Villages will be just one element of the festival, which will also have concerts, dance performances, film showings and theater productions around the city. This year's performances will include a United States premiere of a new ''Tempest,'' blending live and virtual actors on the stage. 
 The festival is held throughout downtown New Haven, on its streets, its famed green, at the Shubert Theater, at the University Theater at Yale Repertory Theater and at the Yale Institute of Sacred Music. A majority of events are free, including a concert with the New Orleans groups Ellis Marsalis Quartet and the Delfeayo Marsalis Quintet, at 8 p.m. on June 10 on the green. The Preservation Hall Jazz Band of New Orleans will perform June 11.
 The presence of the New Orleans artists has also prompted the planning of discussions and lectures on health care, environmental justice, politics and more. 
 ''We want to talk about how we transcend the Katrinas in our own lives,'' Ms. Aleskie said. ''Each of our panels has national policymakers and thinkers represented, as well as local folks, so we can look to have an actual impact. The entire organization is determined to present outstanding international work, but do it in a way that connects with the community. Community cohesion and economic development: Trying to marry those goals is such a lifelong and worthy ambition.''
 The New Haven festival has received about $1 million from the state. The rest of the $3.3 million budget is donated by businesses, foundations and individuals. About 10 percent of the budget is raised at the box office. 
 ''One of the great things that we're able to do because of state support is provide so many events free,'' Ms. Aleskie said. ''Every year, we're raising money to do this the next year.''

HEADLINE: Parks Renovation To Be Studied

 BODY:
The City of Hartford and the Trust for Public Land, a nonprofit conservation group, have announced that they will work together to renovate the city's park system, created more than 100 years ago with the help of the famous landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted, a Hartford native. 
 The trust will study the parks and make recommendations to the city in nine months, according to David Queeley, the New England director of the trust's Parks for People program. Mr. Queeley said the group would seek input from neighborhood leaders and civic organizations throughout the city.
 ''That will give us a pretty good picture of how people perceive the parks, what their desires are and what the issues are,'' he said.
 Hartford has six major parks and many smaller ones, covering 1,556 acres and taking up 13 percent of the city's land, said Lee C. Erdmann, the chief executive for the city. He said renovating them would improve the city's quality of life
 ''Because of the perception of a lack of safety, the parks are not being used as well as they could be, or by as many people as they could be,'' Mr. Erdmann said.
 Tim Northrop, the Connecticut director for the Trust for Public Land, said renovating the parks would help revitalize the city.
 ''Our experience shows us that parks have the potential to increase home ownership, which is a big issue in Hartford,'' he said. ''When you have a nice park, people are going to want to live next to it.'' 
 The trust will also help the city find sources of revenue to improve the parks and possibly build new ones, Mr. Northrup said. 
 Mr. Erdmann said he hoped the city would be able to use the recommendations.
 ''We don't know what they will be, or what the price tag will be, but we certainly hope they are things we can do,'' he said.
 Mr. Erdmann said he did not know how long the project would take.
 ''Because the system is so extensive, it wouldn't surprise me if the results of this study take years to implement,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Inviting New Orleans to Town

BYLINE: By JANE GORDON

 BODY:
EACH year, the International Festival of Arts and Ideas focuses on bringing hundreds of artists from throughout the world to New Haven for about two weeks to dance, sing, perform and display their works. This year, with a new director, the theme grew more specific: Reach out to New Orleans and the artists affected by Hurricane Katrina.
 So New Orleans, with its distinct flavors and sounds, will be descending on New Haven on June 10 through 24. 
New Orleans artists such as Cherice Harrison-Nelson of the group Guardians of the Flame had to set off to find work once Katrina hit.
 ''We are all trying to generate income because a lot of the work that we had lined up we weren't able to do because of the devastation here due to Katrina,'' said Ms. Harrison-Nelson, a member of the Mardi Gras Indian tribe. ''The New Haven festival's producers have been just wonderful in trying to understand what we're going through down here. The outpouring of love that has been extended to us has been a joy for everyone connected to the group.''
 Mary Lou Aleskie, the festival's executive director, said that as much as Katrina was a disaster to New Orleans, its aftermath has started to create a cultural diaspora that has forced Louisiana artists to take their work and culture to the rest of the country. 
 This year's festival will be the first directed by Ms. Aleskie, who started her job last September. She did so without the benefit of any fund-raising efforts or programming plans, but decided to go beyond the standard programming. 
 ''I was moving here in September as Katrina was unfolding, so it was pretty easy for me to envision a new haven for New Orleans as part of this festival,'' said Ms. Aleskie, who moved here from California. ''Now we have an opportunity to embrace this culture and reinforce it. It's a positive force if we can get behind it.''
 Mixing cultures has been a theme of the festival, which was created by Anne Tyler Calabresi, the wife of Guido Calabresi, a judge on the federal Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. 
 Mrs. Calabresi was living in the New Haven suburb of Woodbridge in the 1980's when she became involved in the Leadership, Education, Athletics in Partnership program for children in New Haven. During her time there, she coordinated youth track teams that ran through New Haven's neighborhoods. 
 ''Everyone says the 'hood is terrible, but it isn't,'' Mrs. Calabresi said. ''It's where people are. I'm tired of the segregation we're suffering in our suburban, urban lives, and when people are having fun, they're generally very tolerant.''
 She had no idea how to begin and sought help from a friend, Jean Handley, who had just left the Southern New England Telephone Company as a vice president to found her own communications consulting firm.
 ''It's been great to see something that started as a germ of an idea actually catch hold and be as successful as it's been,'' Ms. Handley said. ''I think we accomplished our original objectives: One was to help regenerate the downtown center of New Haven and bring it alive once again, and the other was to celebrate community and bring people together.''
 Mrs. Calabresi said that many people ''thought we were absolutely crazy'' to take on the project.
 ''But it was a miraculous event,'' she said. ''We spent a lot of time trying to get the community to participate, to bring the world to New Haven, and to bring us all together.'' 
 They opened their first festival in 1995. It now attracts about 100,000 people, who spend about $15 million each season. The majority of the participants spend their time on the city green, where dozens of events are held, and where this year a Village of Villages will bring together Connecticut and regional artists to display their work. 
 The Village of Villages will be just one element of the festival, which will also have concerts, dance performances, film showings and theater productions around the city. This year's performances will include a United States premiere of a new ''Tempest,'' blending live and virtual actors on the stage. 
 The festival is held throughout downtown New Haven, on its streets, its famed green, at the Shubert Theater, at the University Theater at Yale Repertory Theater and at the Yale Institute of Sacred Music. A majority of events are free, including a concert with the New Orleans groups Ellis Marsalis Quartet and the Delfeayo Marsalis Quintet, at 8 p.m. on June 10 on the green. The Preservation Hall Jazz Band of New Orleans will perform June 11.
 The presence of the New Orleans artists has also prompted the planning of discussions and lectures on health care, environmental justice, politics and more. 
 ''We want to talk about how we transcend the Katrinas in our own lives,'' Ms. Aleskie said. ''Each of our panels has national policymakers and thinkers represented, as well as local folks, so we can look to have an actual impact. The entire organization is determined to present outstanding international work, but do it in a way that connects with the community. Community cohesion and economic development: Trying to marry those goals is such a lifelong and worthy ambition.''
 The New Haven festival has received about $1 million from the state. The rest of the $3.3 million budget is donated by businesses, foundations and individuals. About 10 percent of the budget is raised at the box office. 
 ''One of the great things that we're able to do because of state support is provide so many events free,'' Ms. Aleskie said. ''Every year, we're raising money to do this the next year.''

HEADLINE: A Symbol of Carefree, Innocent Fun? Not in Oyster Bay

BYLINE: By LINDA F. BURGHARDT

 BODY:
CHILDREN who love the magic of a carousel ride may begin to feel a tingle when they hear that a carousel has been proposed for a waterfront park in the Town of Oyster Bay. But their parents will quite likely be jolted out of their nostalgia, because this symbol of youthful fun is generating heated debate.
 ''Hand-carved horses, old-style seats shaped like Teddy bears -- the best of the folk art traditions is what we have in mind for the Theodore Roosevelt carousel,'' said Joan Mahon, the executive director of the Oyster Bay Main Street Association, which proposed the project. ''Our plan is to link the downtown shopping district of Oyster Bay hamlet to the waterfront area with this fun, friendly, family-oriented amusement ride.'' 
But not everyone is as excited, as was evident when the plan was presented to the community Tuesday night. For example, Marie Knight, the president of the Oyster Bay Civic Association, attended the meeting and said later that what the Main Street Association wants to do is prohibited in the deed of the Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Park on Oyster Bay Harbor, where the carousel would be built. 
 ''The deed specifically says that no mechanical amusements of a noisy variety are permitted in the park,'' said Ms. Knight, 76, a lifelong resident of Oyster Bay hamlet, who said she was concerned that the proposal would create a carnival atmosphere in the park. ''Besides, they want to build it on a floodplain. They'd have to raise the level of the land at least four feet.''
 But Town Supervisor John Venditto called the carousel project a ''first-class idea.''
 ''I gave it a very favorable review,'' he said. ''It's consistent with the personality of the park and the town.''
 The Oyster Bay carousel would be housed in a timber-frame house built in the same style as the nearby historic train station, which is set to become a railroad museum, said William Sheeline, the president of the Main Street Association. 
 ''We see this proposal bringing vast economic and social benefits to the community,'' he said. ''Family-friendly businesses will come to town, our beautiful waterfront will become more accessible and people will learn more about Theodore Roosevelt, our most famous resident and the only U.S. president from Long Island.''
 This is not the first time a dispute over a carousel has figured in the Town of Oyster Bay's cultural and political life. Earlier this year, the town found its hopes of installing the historic Nunley's carousel in its waterfront park dashed when the Nassau County executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, agreed to return the carousel to its former home in Baldwin.
 But Joseph Scannell, the county legislator from Baldwin who led the effort to move the carousel back to the South Shore, said the refurbishment and relocation had not yet taken place.
 ''Right now we're looking at two potential spots for the carousel, a five-acre parcel in our downtown area and one of our county parks, possibly Silver Lake,'' said Mr. Scannell, a Democrat. ''We've raised most of the funds for the restoration, and we're waiting for the thumbs-up for the half-million we need for the building. There's lots of momentum right now, and we expect this to happen in about a month.''
 Mr. Scannell said the carousel restoration plan is so popular in part because it is a potent symbol of the happy, carefree childhood that parents want to give their youngsters. 
 ''Carousels are beautiful, they are great works of art, and they remind us of our own youth,'' he said. ''We all like to look back and feel happy with what we see.''
 David Kapell, the mayor of Greenport, said that the carousel installed in his town in 1995 had revitalized the formerly blighted downtown. It provides 130,000 rides a year for $1 each. 
 ''Our beautiful carnival-style carousel has been an unbelievable success story,'' said Mr. Kapell, who fondly remembers riding the carousel in Central Park in New York City. ''We expected about 15,000 riders a year. We get over 100,000. It's become a lightning rod for revival in our town.''
 The multicolored 36-horse carousel, built in the 1920's, was donated to the town by Northrop Grumman, and Greenport built a contemporary building in Mitchell Park to house it. ''You should see the kids' faces when they ride,'' Mr. Kapell said. ''I call it our smile machine.''
 Not all carousels on Long Island have enjoyed such success, however. For a short time in 2003, children who visited the Holtsville Ecology Center and Animal Preserve in the Town of Brookhaven were able to ride the newly built Empire State Carousel. But the carousel was shut down after three weeks of operation because the building that housed it failed to meet fire codes.
 The carousel has been given a new lease on life. Last September it was moved upstate to the Farmers' Museum in Cooperstown. Its 26 wooden flying animals -- including a beaver, a mule and a swan -- were scheduled to begin offering rides again this weekend.

HEADLINE: When the Surf's Up, and Gone

BYLINE: By John Weber. 
John Weber is the East Coast regional manager of the Surfrider Foundation, a coastal environment group based in California.

DATELINE: Bradley Beach, N.J. 

 BODY:
COASTAL towns and cities all around America are deciding whether to let the government pay 90 percent of the cost of having the Army Corps of Engineers protect property along their shore by dredging and pumping sand to replenish beaches that have suffered from decades of erosion and overdevelopment. With sea levels rising and stronger, more frequent storms all but certain, how can communities pass up this offer? 
 Recently, though, the City Council of Long Beach, the largest coastal community in Nassau County, voted unanimously against a corps proposal to protect them from storms. 
The reason? These projects do bring in sand that then protects storm waters from damaging coastal property, but they can also make swimming more dangerous and surfing the waves less appealing. The projects often destroy fishing and marine habitat and dump coarse, dark sand on the beaches, making them less aesthetically pleasing. (In 1994, a beach replenishing project in Coney Island brought dredged up rocks and mud to the beach there.) 
 So while these projects may sound like a good idea, there are several downsides. Communities like Long Beach are right to say no if they don't feel that the corps is taking into proper consideration the effect that a project will have on the beach. 
 In the mid to late 1990's, 11 municipalities in Monmouth County, N.J., received a huge dredge and fill replenishment project -- one of the biggest in our nation's history. Sea Bright, Monmouth Beach and the beaches from Asbury Park to Manasquan had become severely eroded because of natural erosion and poorly planned development. 
 The corps's design for these beaches was essentially a big box of sand about 10 feet high and 140 feet wide. Immediately after construction, these enormous beaches were very steep, especially at the watermark. Swimming was hazardous because of the steep slope and deep water close to shore. Furthermore, the project buried sandbars and rock jetties, which had broken up incoming waves, so now the waves crash directly onto the beach, making swimming even more dangerous. 
 Normally, sandbars and rock jetties shape waves, making them suitable for bodysurfers, body boarders, surfers and kayakers to ride. But to this day, there are very few surfable waves in Sea Bright and Monmouth Beach because of what the corps did to those beaches. 
 Moreover, sandbars and rocks attract and harbor bait and fish. When the corps smothered the sandbars and rocks, marine life disappeared too. In the southeastern United States, altered beaches like these have made it nearly impossible for endangered sea turtles to nest.
 What's worse is that these expensive projects -- the one for Long Beach was estimated to cost $98.5 million -- offer no guarantee of protection from storms and the resulting wind damage. For instance, the plans for barrier islands like Long Beach, did not offer protection from bay-side flooding, nor do plans for another barrier island, Long Beach Island, N.J., which is currently working out final details with the corps on a beach replenishment project. 
 It's clear that we need to redefine success in these projects. An engineer's idea of a good beach is different from a beach user's view. While the corps claims that its projects are intended to protect property -- the most desirable and expensive property in the country -- they often destroy or diminish the very things that make that real estate so valuable.
 Part of the solution is to change how Congress finances and reviews these projects and the corps. Bills have been introduced that would subject these large projects to an independent review board, but their passage is a long way off. So in the meantime, states and municipalities dealing with the corps should recognize that they have some control.
 Even though corps guidelines say their plans must maximize the economic benefits of protecting structures, communities have the right to lobby for an alternative. Project designs can and should be modified to consider recreation in light of local needs and how the beach is used. Smaller, less expensive projects should be options even if they provide less storm protection. 
 The decision reached in Long Beach reflects that view of local control. Many residents said they knew and accepted the risks of living on a barrier island. And while some risk to their homes was acceptable, the possibility of a damaged beach was not. They decided to take their share of the project cost and put it toward real storm-preparedness measures like evacuation plans, stricter building codes and devices to reduce wind damage -- all good alternatives to replenishing beaches. 
 In the long run, the health of our economy and that of our environment are inseparable. The coast is where this realization is easiest to see, and where an unlikely decision by an unlikely city council -- like that in Long Beach -- represents a small but promising step in the right direction.

HEADLINE: Where's the Petite Department? Going the Way of the Petticoat 

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Twenty-five years ago, America's department stores -- long obsessed with that Seventh Avenue archetype, the tall, thin, leggy lady -- discovered her shorter sibling, the petite woman. They gave her a special clothing size, her own department and, over time, access to top designers like Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan and Calvin Klein.
 Small was suddenly sexy. Or at least sexier.
But the love affair with little women appears to be over. Three of the country's most influential fashion emporiums -- Neiman Marcus, Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale's -- have quietly eliminated or drastically scaled back their petite departments in the past several months, infuriating many longtime customers. 
 Given that manufacturers produce clothing in only a handful of standard sizes -- among them, juniors, misses and plus size -- the abandonment of petite sizes at the highest levels of American retailing represents a sea change in fashion, forcing some designers to either stop making special sizes for smaller women or re-evaluate how much to invest in the business.
 Executives at the three department stores said the decision was based on the poor sales of petite sizes, which are traditionally designed for a woman 5-foot-4 or smaller, with pant lengths and jacket proportions cut accordingly. Petite women, they said, would rather wear the more youthful, skin-baring and tighter-fitting clothing in the contemporary departments, even if it does not fit them as well. And, they point out, there is always tailoring.
 But despite what executives say, overall sales of petite clothing sizes have grown in the past several years, reaching $10 billion. So petite women suspect another culprit: high-end department stores that they say view the petite consumer as older, unfashionable and undesirable.
 ''It's not like American women suddenly got tall,'' said the designer Dana Buchman, who has supplied petite-size tweed jackets and chiffon skirts to Saks and Neiman Marcus for years. ''I think it's a mistake.'' 
 And so do many short women. Feeling overlooked and undervalued, they have written the stores angry letters and groused, often loudly, to salespeople. ''It's horrible, just horrible,'' said Laurel Bernstein, 60, a 5-foot-1 Manhattan resident who stormed out of Saks's flagship store in March after learning that the company had stopped carrying petite sizes. A lifelong Saks shopper, she has not returned since. 
 The emotional response from petite consumers has proved so strong that Saks is reconsidering its decision. ''It appears that we have frustrated some customers,'' said Ron Frasch, the chief merchant at Saks. ''We are trying to figure out how many we have frustrated.''
 The shock has been particularly acute because the changes are happening simultaneously at three of the nation's most important destinations for fashion. 
 As if in lockstep over the past year, Saks ceased selling petite sizes, Bloomingdale's cut the space it devotes to petites by nearly half in some stores, and Neiman Marcus reduced the number of stores with petite departments by nearly half. Neiman Marcus now carries petite sizes in just eight of its 36 stores; as of the fall, it will stock them in just two.
 The shrinking sales floor space for petite sizes -- which has not been duplicated in the plus-size department -- has already claimed several casualties on Seventh Avenue. The clothing label Ellen Tracy, a mainstay of the petite department at Saks, Neiman Marcus and Bloomingdale's, said it had stopped producing petite sizes altogether because its biggest retail clients were not buying enough merchandise.
 ''We would love to stay in the petite business'' said Ellen Tracy's president, Howard Rosenberger. ''We didn't have a choice.''
 For those designers, like Eileen Fisher, who continue to produce petite sizes for department stores, there is a growing unease about the business. ''There are not enough vendors anymore,'' said Mariclare Van Bergen, vice president of sales at Eileen Fisher, which supplies petite clothing to Neiman Marcus and Bloomingdale's. ''So how do we keep the energy in the petite world?'' 
 Petite sizes did not reach large numbers of consumers until the early 1980's, when a handful of major apparel labels like Liz Claiborne and Adrienne Vittadini, having discovered that millions of smaller women did not fit into their regular clothing lines, agreed to produce petite sizes. 
 The new sizes were not simply smaller, they had different proportions. On a woman's blazer, for example, designers reduced the distance between arm holes and the waist. Labels on the new clothesbore a ''P'' to distinguish them. 
 A petite craze was soon born, with Jones New York, Ellen Tracy and Anne Klein creating special lines and department stores establishing a separate section for smaller sizes. Rather than tracking down petite sizes on different floors, women could shop all of them in one place, relying on one salesperson for help.
 Specialty clothing retailers like Talbots and Banana Republic then created separate stores for petite women. Last year, sales of petites rose 11 percent, according to the market research firm NPD Group. But at department stores alone, sales of petite clothing fell 5 percent. 
 Still, stores like Nordstrom, Macy's and Sears have not cut back on petites, and report brisk sales. So what went wrong at Saks, Neiman Marcus and Bloomingdale's? 
 For the record, their shoppers did not enjoy growth spurts that catapulted them out of petite sizes. The average American woman, who was about 5-foot-3 in 1980, was 0.3 inches taller as of 2002, according to the government. 
 What did change is that petite departments gained a reputation for traditional -- some would say frumpy -- career-oriented clothing. Chic looks, clothing executives said, never made the leap from regular sizes to petite. So the very word petite became synonymous with many women who shopped there -- working women over the age 50. 
 ''It's a segment of the population that these stores don't care to maintain,'' said Andrew V. Jassin, the managing director of the Jassin-O'Rourke Group, a fashion consulting firm, ''It's a snobbish appeal. The retailers want to keep the contemporary women -- and she does not want to be called petite.''
 In the battle for space on the sales floor, executives said, the petite collections from Dana Buchman, Anne Klein and Ellen Tracy, which produce slim profits, are losing out to contemporary clothing brands like Theory, Laundry and Tahari, which draw more dollars. 
 Mr. Frasch of Saks said that smaller shoppers preferred to buy those younger, sexier brands and pay for alterations. ''It's not a perfect situation, but it appears to service what they want better.''
 Ann Stordahl, executive vice president for women's apparel at Neiman Marcus, said that designers were making clothing smaller than a decade ago and that Neiman Marcus orders extra size zeros and twos, knowing they will appeal to petite women. Even without petite sizes, she said, ''there are many offerings for the smaller size customer.'' 
 Bloomingdale's declined an interview request. In a statement, Frank Doroff, Bloomingdale's senior executive vice president of ready-to-wear clothing, said the size of the petite section ''is commensurate with the demand'' at every store. 
 But for women of a certain height, a certain age (45 and older) and a certain rung on the economic ladder (that is, wealthy), no amount of size two skirts or dresses will replace the original, spacious petite departments at Neiman's, Saks or Bloomingdale's. 
 Because for her, the petite department was not about indulgence or convenience, but about parity. It meant that even at 4-foot-11, she could wear the same sheer cascading vest from Eileen Fisher as a woman who was 5-foot-7 -- with no tailoring required. 
 It meant that designers really did care about the little people. 
 Inside Bloomingdale's last week, Manhattan resident Judy Strauss, who is 65 and 5-foot-2, tried on two short-sleeved shirts from the designer Sigrid Olsen. Neither was available in a petite size, so she tried on a small and an extra-small. 
 ''The saleswoman and I joked that maybe I should go to the girl's department,'' she recalled. ''I really don't know where I should go.''
 Referring to the department stores, Ms. Van Bergen of Eileen Fisher said that ''you have this consumer who can no longer shop here, no longer shop there.'' The petite woman, she said, ''is feeling a little bit lost right now.''

HEADLINE: Colombian Leader, Seeking Re-election, Warns of Catastrophe 

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO; Monica Trujillo contributed reporting from Bogota for this article, and Jenny Carolina Gonzalez from Neiva.

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, May 27 

 BODY:
His handlers portray President Alvaro Uribe as a wonkish technocrat too busy solving Colombia's problems to become mired in its tumultuous politics. But as he finished campaigning for re-election ahead of Sunday's voting, Mr. Uribe transformed himself into a master salesman whose message was simple and effective: it's me or catastrophe.
 On a recent night, his staccato voice filling the Plaza de Bolivar here, Mr. Uribe rattled off his accomplishments -- military victories against Marxist guerrillas, expanded nutritional programs for the elderly, a free-trade pact with Washington. 
''All of it appears like a lot, but it is not very much in the face of what the Colombian people need,'' Mr. Uribe said in a long speech, emphasizing that more work needed to be done and that he was the man to do it. ''The victory will be the Colombian people's, the victory will be yours.'' 
 Mr. Uribe's projection as a determined and steady caretaker of a troubled country, coupled with his talents for imagery and populism, have made him the man to beat, and perhaps one of the most popular presidents in Colombia's history. 
 Polls show Mr. Uribe, a 53-year-old lawyer, at least 30 points ahead of his nearest rival -- Carlos Gaviria, a former Constitutional Court justice -- and well on his way to capturing the 50 percent needed to avoid a runoff.
 The Bush White House, which has given Colombia more than $3 billion in the Uribe years, mostly as military and antidrug aid, has a lot riding on the election as well, in a region filled with political tumult and rising leftist populism. President Bush himself has not held back on heaping praise, calling Mr. Uribe ''a strong and principled leader.''
 But as Mr. Uribe prepares for what will most likely be another four-year term, political analysts, opposition politicians and human rights groups have raised concern about the concentrated power he will amass and his often heavy-handed style of governing. 
 Sixty-one percent of Congress is allied with the president. Another four years will most likely put government allies on the Constitutional Court and in the comptroller's office, both now independent institutions prone to oppose Mr. Uribe.
 ''The Uribe supporters would say this is the price of victory,'' wrote Maria Jimena Duzan, a columnist in El Tiempo and critic of Mr. Uribe's policies. ''If Uribe is re-elected, he will have omnipotent power without precedent in our history.'' 
 Uribe administration officials and their allies cringe at such criticism. They say the president has done more than any other leader to reduce Colombia's once-spiraling violence and the spread of its biggest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC. 
 Homicides dropped to just above 18,000 last year from nearly 29,000 in 2002, when Mr. Uribe was elected, and kidnappings fell to 800 from nearly 3,000. 
 Colombia's economy grew 4 percent or better the last three years, foreign investment tripled after Mr. Uribe took office and drug crops were hard hit by crop dusters.
 ''President Uribe is a responsible and serious man,'' Senator Oscar Ivan Zuluaga said. ''You do not get re-elected unless you've met your commitments, and he's met them, on the social front, the political, the economic and on security.'' 
 Mr. Uribe, a former governor of his home state, Antioquia, studied at Oxford and Harvard, and tends toward ill-fitting suits, wire-frame glasses and schoolboy haircuts.
 But he knows how to appeal to a crowd, often to its lesser instincts, drawing comparisons with populists like President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela. ''Uribe sells products, an image -- that is really the authoritarian spell he has,'' said Eduardo Carreno, director of the Lawyers' Collective, a Bogota group that fights the government on rights issues. 
 The strong image has appealed to Colombians, and Mr. Uribe has used it to tighten his hold on power. Mr. Uribe and his ministers have battled with other institutions, like the Constitutional Court, suggesting that they get in the way of governing. 
 Mr. Uribe is also not above old-fashioned cronyism, political observers, congressmen and critics contend. To get the constitutional amendment that permitted him to run again, Mr. Uribe's government won the support of members of Congress by providing dozens of jobs in embassies, consulates and government agencies to their relatives.
 He browbeats the news media, dressing down reporters in public, and has called for corrupt politicians to be lynched. He goes directly to the people in his so-called Community Council meetings, promising to fix potholes and improve schools. He takes notes and jots down the phone numbers of residents. He promises immediate relief.
 ''He is the only one who has thought of the poor and listened to the people,'' Nancy Patricia Trujillo, 29, a single mother, said at an Uribe rally in the southern city of Neiva. 
 Ms. Trujillo and many others dismiss the criticisms of Mr. Uribe. 
 Experts say he is vulnerable to charges that he has been overly generous in disarmament negotiations with right-wing paramilitary groups, helping them morph into secretive drug-trafficking groups. 
 The government was also wounded by news reports that the intelligence service collaborated with paramilitaries to assassinate leftist union activists and provided secret information to drug traffickers. Mr. Uribe has angrily denied the allegations. 
 One of Colombia's incisive analysts, Antonio Caballero, said Mr. Uribe avoided the scandals by separating himself from ministers or generals who blundered. ''His role is not to take responsibility in the acts of his government,'' Mr. Caballero wrote in the newsweekly Semana. 
 Critics often come under withering attack from Mr. Uribe, be they former allies, like Senator Rafael Pardo, or rights groups. He has even accused opponents of ties to Marxist guerrillas, a dangerous charge where death squads frequently go after allies of the FARC rebels. 
 But that did not stop Mr. Uribe from recently saying the choice on Sunday is between him and Communism. ''The country is going to have to choose if we will improve democratic security as a way to peace,'' he said, ''or if we'll go back to the unseen Communism that will turn the country over to the FARC.''

HEADLINE: After Scandals, Usually Sunny San Diegans Wonder if City Has Hit Bottom

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO 

 BODY:
Last summer, shortly after former Mayor Dick Murphy resigned in the depths of San Diego's legal, political and financial crisis, city officials quietly removed the boosterish slogan ''America's Finest City'' from the city's Web site.
 Jerry Sanders, the former San Diego chief of police who became mayor in December, restored the upbeat motto as one of his first official acts, even as the investigations, indictments and deficits continued to pour forth. 
''What were we supposed to say?'' the mayor asked with a weary laugh in a recent interview. ''We're in the top third?''
 Mr. Sanders has somehow maintained his sense of humor after six months in one of the toughest municipal offices in America. San Diego, once a model of prosperity and competent governance, is reeling under a seemingly endless series of blows.
 In the past 18 months, San Diegans have witnessed City Council members on trial for taking bribes from a strip club operator, other officials facing charges of enriching themselves by manipulating the city's pension funds and Wall Street refusing to underwrite any borrowing by the city because it cannot provide credible financial statements.
 The city has had two nasty mayoral elections since 2004, and the city attorney is essentially at war with the City Council and the pension fund board. And perhaps most frightening to many residents, the once-inexorable rise in real estate values has leveled off, and prices may be starting to drop.
 ''It's all the fun I hoped for,'' said Mr. Sanders, 55. ''And maybe a little bit more.''
 Many here are wondering if San Diego has hit bottom, or if worse is yet to come.
 ''This is no doubt the darkest period in San Diego's history,'' said Malin Burnham, who made a fortune in real estate and who has devoted the last 20 years to philanthropic projects and building the city's image. ''We have seen three or four years of turmoil, but I think it's all correctable and it's being corrected.''
 That is what the optimistic Mr. Sanders would like the 1.2 million residents of this seaside metropolis to believe. 
 He delivered a series of unusually blunt messages when he took office in December. In his inaugural address he said: ''Our city government is broken. There's no other way to put it.'' He cataloged the city's ills and the sometimes criminal actions that had caused them and said, ''Those days have come to an end.''
 A month later, in his State of the City address, Mr. Sanders said San Diego faced the most serious financial, organizational and ethical crisis in its history. ''As best I can tell,'' he said, ''the operating philosophy around City Hall involved one of these three words: delay, deny or deceive.''
 Even the most jaded cheered this rare burst of candor.
 Scott Lewis, executive editor of the Voice of San Diego, a feisty year-old Internet newspaper (voiceofsandiego.org), said he and his skeptical colleagues thought that San Diego might have emerged from its dark alley.
 ''He gave an amazing speech, and there was a collective sigh of relief around the city,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''Some of the gloom lifted.''
 But he said that in recent months Mr. Sanders had softened his candid assessment of the city and had begun to ally himself with the boosters and business leaders who for years had concealed the city's problems under a haze of sunny salesmanship.
 ''The creeping tendency of the past -- to paint a rosy picture -- has returned,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''There's a nationwide advertising campaign under way, but not a single fundamental reform has taken place.''
 Michael J. Aguirre, the city attorney, believes the city has a long way to go to clean up its politics and get its books in order. He said that the city pension fund deficit was closer to $2 billion than to the official figure of $1.4 billion, and that the fund for health care benefits for city retirees was an additional $1 billion in the red. He is not quite ready to declare San Diego financially bankrupt, but he said it long ago went into legal and ethical receivership.
 ''When it comes to violations of the law, they're so plentiful,'' Mr. Aguirre said, referring to allegations of illegal pension benefits and the bribery charges against the three members of the City Council. ''It's like salmon season in Alaska.''
 Eight former city officials are awaiting trial on charges that they concealed the granting of large increases in pension benefits for themselves and other city employees while pushing a plan to permit the pension plan to operate at a substantial deficit.
 In an unrelated matter labeled ''Strippergate,'' one City Council member was convicted last summer of accepting bribes to help the owner of a topless bar get the city's no-touching rule lifted. Another Council member's conviction was overturned. A third councilman died before his case came to trial.
 A number of state and federal investigations into the city's finances and politics continue.
 Mayor Sanders said he believed that the city had seen its worst days. ''It was every bit as bad as I thought when I took office,'' he said. ''But I do think the problems can be solved.
 ''It's a painful process,'' he added.
 He said that he took some comfort from the fact that many other large American cities were facing similar financial problems because of pension obligations, backlogs of expensive infrastructure needs and the rising cost of health care for city workers and retirees. He agreed with some analysts who describe San Diego as the canary in the coal mine of American cities. Its fate will point the way for dozens of others, Mr. Sanders said.
 Pat Shea, a lawyer who ran for mayor last year, said Mr. Sanders should take little solace from other cities' troubles. San Diego has descended further and faster than any other big American city and has not shown the political will to confront its problems, he said.
 ''I sense a weariness among the people of San Diego,'' Mr. Shea said.

HEADLINE: Plan for Sharpshooters to Thin Colorado Elk Herd Draws Critics

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

DATELINE: ESTES PARK, Colo., May 25 

 BODY:
The elk that roam Rocky Mountain National Park in their slow-moving majesty have become a signature attraction for tourists, and an economic driver of the economy in this town at the park's edge. 
 But the animals leave some mighty big hoof prints. The park's biology has been skewed by elk overpopulation, which biologists say is squeezing out even butterflies and beavers, both of which need the aspen groves that the elk herd of perhaps 3,000 animals decimates in its search for food.
The town itself has become an elk playground as well. The animals regularly stop traffic -- a phenomenon beloved by visitors -- but they are also becoming more and more of a nuisance, and occasionally even a threat. The chief of police, Lowell Richardson, said he had been chased around more than once on the golf course. A woman was seriously injured several years ago when she got between a mother elk and her calf. 
 But now the town-park-elk triangle, with elements of economics and elk biology in equal measure, is about to change profoundly, and few are happy. Park administrators have proposed a 20-year program of herd reduction and management that would involve shooting hundreds of elk, mostly at night in the park, using sharpshooters with silencers. 
 Critics of the plan advocate either bringing back wolves to control the population, or recreational hunters or contraception. Park officials say that they have studied every option and that ''lethal reduction,'' as the plan is called, is the best way to bring the numbers of elk down to a sustainable 1,200 or so. 
 Estes Park itself, meanwhile, is bracing for the elk themselves to react and adapt by moving even more into the community than they are now. Town officials and residents say that when the park is no longer a safety zone for the animals, as it has been since the 1960's when the last herd-reduction program was abandoned, the town will become the inevitable refuge.
 ''There's a lot of concern,'' said Dave Shirk, a town planner who attended a public meeting on the herd-reduction plan here on Thursday night. Mr. Shirk said he believed that an elk exodus into the streets of Estes Park was inevitable. The question, he said, is whether the impact will be tempered by the park's proposed reduction in total elk numbers.
 ''That's our hope, that's our thought,'' he said.
 What was equally clear at the sometimes raucous public meeting was that love of elk, love of the park and passionately defended positions about how to resolve the problem go hand in hand. Every idea posited from one side -- allowing a hunt, allowing predation from wolves, allowing the elk population to grow and not worrying about the ecological consequences -- was vehemently denounced by somebody else on the elk-opinion spectrum. Park officials say they plan to announce a decision on a plan late this year or early next.
 ''The park is in a no-win situation,'' said David Beldus, a retired teacher and former national park ranger, as he sat watching the fireworks at the meeting. 
 Value judgments about the relationships of humans and animals and the imagery of the national parks also color the debate, wildlife biologists and public policy experts say. 
 ''The national parks are considered special by most Americans, the place where we should let natural processes work as much as possible,'' said Robert A. Garrott, a professor of ecology at Montana State University in Bozeman. 
 And in Rocky Mountain National Park, natural is a tough thing to pin down. The elk certainly do not qualify. Their tame behavior, with no predators to keep them wily, is utterly unelklike to a wildlife biologist. They are not native. Most of the herd is believed to be descended from elk brought to Colorado in 1913 and 1914 from Wyoming after the local herds were driven to near extinction. The park was established in 1915.
 The aspen groves, by contrast, which propagate by cloning one individual through shoots, are thousands of years old, dating from the end of the last ice age, and are uniquely connected and adapted to the specific life history of the park's lands, said Therese Johnson, the park's lead biologist on the elk issue.
 Deer culling at night, using night-vision goggles and silencers, is well established in many parts of the country. But park officials acknowledge that trying the practice with elk, which can weigh upward of 700 pounds for full-grown bull, two or three times the size of a common white-tail deer, is new territory.
 Human population growth ultimately underscores all the considerations, epitomized by Estes Park and its shoulder-rubbing proximity to the herd. More people are living closer than ever, and in greater numbers, to places like Rocky Mountain National Park, which was set aside for a glimpse of the wild.
 When gray wolves were introduced into Yellowstone National Park in 1995, by contrast, advocates for the experiment could argue that the buffer zones of national forests, and the park's huge size, made it big enough and isolated enough that nature could be natural in keeping down elk and deer populations.
 Rocky Mountain National Park, at just over 400 square miles, is only about one-eighth as big as Yellowstone, and 2.4 million people in the Denver metropolitan area live within a two- or three-hour drive.
 ''The lesson is that the more we ring these parks with other activities and encroach on them, the more we're setting ourselves up for difficult issues,'' said David K. Skelly, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at Yale.
 Mr. Shirk, the town planner, said his professional concern about what might happen to his community as a result of elk reduction was balanced against the love he has for the animals. 
 ''I live here; I want to see the elk in my backyard,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Sri Lanka Peace Is in Peril, Norwegian Envoy Warns

BYLINE: By The New York Times

DATELINE: COLOMBO, Sri Lanka, May 27 

 BODY:
A top Norwegian envoy warned Saturday that Sri Lanka could be headed toward war, even as the parties agreed in principle to meet for talks to discuss the safety of northern European cease-fire monitors. 
 ''The situation is very grave,'' Erik Solheim, Norway's international development minister, said in a telephone interview from India after his deputy, Jon Hanssen-Bauer, met with the Tamil rebels' political chief in northern Sri Lanka.
''Full-scale war is not inevitable but may still happen,'' said Mr. Solheim, who helped broker a 2002 cease-fire agreement between Sri Lanka and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. 
 The Norwegians invited the rebels and the government to Oslo on June 8-9 for talks regarding the security of the truce monitors.
 Both sides confirmed Saturday that they had agreed to attend. 
 ''This is a very limited engagement,'' said Palitha Kohona, head of the government's peace secretariat. ''The L.T.T.E. has still not agreed to peace talks,'' he said.
 Mr. Kohona added, though, that it was ''better to be engaged in discussions relating to the peace process than not be engaged in discussions at all.''
 Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland and Iceland have been monitoring the cease-fire. But the mission's security fell into question after two monitors were on board a Sri Lankan Navy craft that came under suspected rebel attack on May 11 in northern Sri Lanka, in the worst sea battle since the 2002 truce came into effect. 
 The Tigers have since warned the monitoring mission against escorting navy ships. 
 More than 300 people have been killed since April in violence, mainly in the island's north and east, which have an ethnic Tamil majority.
 The 25-member state European Union is expected to approve action against the rebels next week, in a move that will freeze assets, clamp down on fund-raising and bar travel and diplomatic contacts. The Tigers are already banned in the United States, Britain, Canada and India.
 The Associated Press reported Saturday that the army and the insurgents shelled each other's positions for nearly 30 minutes in eastern Batticaloa, said an officer at the army's news media unit in Colombo.

HEADLINE: East Timor's Capital Spirals Into Violence, Despite U.N. Peacekeepers

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: DILI, East Timor, May 27 

 BODY:
The police here, trained by the United Nations as a privileged force over the four years of this country's existence, melted away in this dilapidated capital on Saturday, abandoning their stations for hiding places they felt would keep them safe from a revengeful military.
 Opposing gangs of young men, divided along lines of ethnicity and armed with rocks and machetes, roamed the streets setting afire dwellings that sent up palls of thick smoke. All stores were closed. The city's handful of gas stations shut down when their Western owners, fearful that their employees would be attacked and their pumps emptied, were evacuated. 
The arrival of Australian and Malaysian peacekeepers in the past two days had failed by Saturday to stem the chaos that has engulfed the city after a week of violence between factions of East Timor's security forces.
 ''In terms of terror, this is the worst day we've had so far,'' said a Western diplomat, who was not authorized to speak for attribution. ''We're still left with anarchy in Dili, with no police and no Australian sheriff to take charge.'' 
 Several hundred people clustered around the walls of the United States Embassy on Saturday afternoon, seeking a sense of security from a big power. Families fled their homes for shelter in schools, and the airport grounds served as a major gathering place, including for many women with children.
 ''They just burned down our house today,'' said Jacqueline Siapno. ''Our very close friends told us they tried to guard the house, but guys came yesterday and bashed down the doors, and today they came back to burn it. It seems they feel violence is the only way they can solve things.''
 Mrs. Siapno, the wife of a prominent opposition party leader, Fernando Lasamma, who was a leader in East Timor's 20-year struggle for independence against Indonesia, said she understood that violence was perhaps necessary back then. In a 1999 referendum, East Timor voted for separation from Indonesia, and it was run by the United Nations until independence in May 2002. 
 ''I understand violence was the price of independence,'' Mrs. Siapno said. ''But why now?''
 Law and order broke down in recent months as the United Nations, which had treated East Timor as a test for helping poor, newly independent countries, was about to leave the country, its job as political and military trainer completed. The more than 300 staff members at the United Nations compound here had been scheduled to leave in April. But that was before the violence increased.
 The United Nations and the World Bank had hoped that East Timor, which has a population of 926,000, would pass a critical five-year threshold. ''Most countries emerging from conflict, especially new countries, relapse into violence within five years,'' a World Bank report said last year. The report said East Timor looked set to break the mold.
 Instead, the security situation had deteriorated so much that the United Nations announced Saturday that it was evacuating more than 250 nonessential personnel and the dependents of 100 United Nations officials who would remain. The staff members who will stay were warned Saturday at a briefing that they could become targets of the violence, said a spokeswoman, Kym Louise Smithie.
 The number of people killed in the last week remained unclear. Several Western officials said they believed it was more than 20.
 The deadliest episode occurred Thursday when soldiers loyal to the government shot dead 10 unarmed police officers as they were leaving police headquarters under a truce arranged by the United Nations.
 In an interview on Saturday, Sukehiro Hasegawa, the United Nations resident representative, said the police asked for help from the United Nations after a contingent of soldiers attacked the police headquarters, adjacent to the United Nations compound. 
 He showed photographs of the unarmed East Timorese police officers being escorted out of their building by United Nations police officers dressed in blue United Nations helmets and vests, and carrying the blue United Nations flag. An additional photograph showed six of the East Timorese dead on the ground. Another four died as well, he said. 
 ''It was very clear the gunmen aimed at the police,'' Mr. Hasegawa said, despite a pledge to the United Nations not to do so. The East Timorese prime minister, Mari Alkatiri, had expressed regret. ''But that is not enough,'' Mr. Hasegawa said.
 At the heart of the violence lies a deep animosity between the police and the military, and between ethnic groups, he said.
 The military resented the prominence given to the police by the international officials, including more training. ''There was rivalry in the security sector,'' Mr. Hasegawa said.
 This jealousy was compounded by ethnicity, he said. The police were predominantly from the western part of the country, and the senior ranks of the army mostly from the east. Arguments also have erupted over which ethnic group did the most to gain independence.
 In the last several days, the United Nations compound had become a place where police officers were seeking safe haven from the military, he said. Soldiers were going to the hospital and trying to drag wounded police officers out, he said.
 The chief of police, Paulo Martins, was in hiding.
 Also in hiding was a loose coalition of forces that opposed the prime minister, Mr. Alkatiri. Camped in the hills above the city, the group included 600 young soldiers, mostly from the western part of East Timor and many with only several years of schooling, who were discharged from the military after complaining about ethnic discrimination by their commanders. 
 They were joined this month by a prominent army officer, Alfredo Reinado, who had defected with 30 men, weapons and trucks. 
 The men in the hills are now afraid to come down, the Western diplomat said. ''They are all terrified they will be hunted down and killed.''

HEADLINE: Ukraine Battles Smugglers As Europe Keeps Close Eye

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

DATELINE: KUCHURGAN, Ukraine 

 BODY:
It did not take long for the European Union's border experts to spot evidence of the shadowy trade on Ukraine's notoriously porous border with Moldova. It came in an unexpected form, though: Tyson frozen chicken.
 ''Every time, leg quarters,'' Torsten Spehr, a German border officer, said at this border crossing with Moldova's self-declared separatist region, Transnistria.
 In a recent six months, more than 40,000 tons of chicken was shipped, legally, into Transnistria through Black Sea ports in Ukraine, said experts sent by the European Union this year to monitor the border. 
 Because that amounted to 146 pounds for each Transnistrian, something was clearly amiss. 
 The chicken is reloaded into smaller trucks, often with makeshift refrigeration, and smuggled back into Ukraine. There it is sold below market rates, because it evaded customs duties and Ukrainian sanitary inspections, turning hefty profit -- for whom, exactly, is not clear -- of nearly $1,000 a ton.
 ''They make more money than they would dealing with weapons,'' said Joachim Haack, a German who is in charge of the European Union's outpost here.
 The racket represents the murky economy that has sustained Transnistria, a ragged ribbon of territory along Moldova's eastern border, since it declared its independence from Moldova in 1992. 
 And it goes beyond a dispute over customs and chicken parts, which are still known here as ''Bush legs,'' after an early 1990's program to ship American poultry to the former Soviet republics.
 Now, Ukraine and Moldova have governments eager to burnish relations with Europe and the United States. And they have taken steps to shut down not only smuggling but also the unregistered trade that has flowed from Transnistria with little regard for Moldova's sovereign borders or Ukrainian duties.
 Late last year, the two countries invited the European Union's observer mission to monitor the frontier on both sides of Transnistria. 
 Since March 3, Moldova and Ukraine have also refused to allow Transnistria to ship any goods -- like steel, electronics and clothing -- that have not been cleared through Moldovan customs.
 Officials in Transnistria refused to comply, defying the central Moldovan authorities, as they have for nearly 14 years, and calling the new rules a blockade. Virtually all legal trade across the Ukrainian border has since stopped.
 ''The 650,000 people who live in Transnistria have become hostages,'' a spokesman for the region's foreign ministry, Vitali V. Ignatyev, said by telephone.
 After years of impasse, officials in Ukraine and Moldova, at the encouragement of the United States and Europe, are pressing for a solution to the conflict in Transnistria. And they are doing so at the risk of inflaming Transnistria's separatist sentiment and worsening relations with the region's patron, Russia.
 The goal, a senior American official said, is to ''effect a change in the status quo.'' 
 ''The only other country that could do that is Russia,'' the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity because of diplomatic protocol. ''And they are not interested.''
 Transnistria, also known as Trans-Dniester, is one of the so-called frozen conflicts that emerged from the collapse of the Soviet Union. For a long time, Ukrainian businesses and politicians provided support by tolerating -- and some say profiting from -- the exports that poured in and out of landlocked Transnistria through the Black Sea ports of Odessa. The election of President Viktor A. Yushchenko a year and a half ago appears to be changing that.
 Mr. Yushchenko's government now portrays the 286-mile border with Transnistria as a sieve for contraband. Anatoly K. Kinakh, until recently Mr. Yushchenko's national security adviser, estimated that the illegal trade from Transnistria amounted to $250 million a year.
 ''The Transnistrian situation is one that affects the national security of Ukraine,'' Mr. Kinakh said in an interview in Kiev, the capital.
 Here at Kuchurgan there are signs of more vigorous enforcement along a frontier that was not even marked in most places until this year. That was when Ukrainian border troops dug a trench along it. For the first time, signs marking the border have appeared, warning smugglers and others to stay out.
 The European Union's experts have no enforcement powers, but since they began monitoring, the Ukrainians have increased their patrols and their seizures of contraband. Already this year the authorities have seized 400 tons of chicken returning to Ukraine, a small fraction of the total smuggled, experts say. 
 In April, border troops seized 10 trucks in one convoy, with nearly 100 tons, much of it nearing its expiration date. In that case, the smugglers had welded a makeshift steel bridge to span the new trench. Twenty were arrested.
 Antti Hartikainen, the Finnish deputy leader of the European Union's mission, said the amount of chicken and the sophistication of the smuggling efforts, including the need for warehouses in Transnistria and the retrofitted trucks to transport the chicken back, suggested that the operation had official support in Transnistria.
 ''This has to be a well-organized business,'' he said in an interview at mission headquarters in Odessa.
 Whose business remains unclear. Much of the chicken is shipped to a company called Sherif, one of Transnistria's largest conglomerates, European and Ukrainian officials said.
 In a telephone interview from the Transnistrian capital, Tiraspol, the company's deputy director, Pavel A. Shkilnyuk, angrily denied any connection to smuggling and accused Ukrainians of smuggling cheap Chinese goods into Transnistria. 
 ''I will not give you any information,'' he said, then hung up.
 Tyson Foods, based in Springdale, Ark., said it shipped a ''limited amount'' of chicken to Moldova through Ukrainian ports -- far less than to Russia, which accounted for a quarter of Tyson's international sales. ''We've heard reports of various products being improperly transported in and out of the Ukraine through Moldova,'' a spokesman, Gary Mickelson, said via e-mail, ''and we try to avoid doing business with any companies we believe may be involved in such illegal activity.''
 He did not say whether any shipments had been suspended because of those concerns.
 It is unclear whether the new controls will shut down the illicit trade or whether the measures will soon ease the impasse between Moldova and Transnistria. 
 Transnistria canceled a round of negotiations, and its leaders have threatened to hold a referendum on independence or to declare Transnistria part of Russia.
 [''Russia has always protected citizens of Transnistria,'' the region's president, Igor N. Smirnov, said Wednesday, the Olvia news agency reported. ''Both sides have lived together spiritually, as we have a common, purely Russian mentality.'']
 The European Union has praised the willingness of Ukraine and Moldova to improve border controls, but it has also criticized shortcomings.
 Border posts lack a centralized database to track who and what crosses at various points of entry, making detection of smugglers difficult, said a report the mission gave the authorities on May 5.
 The report also criticized a lack of basics, like proper lighting and shortcomings in Ukrainian laws, that let smugglers go largely unpunished.
 Vladimir K. Pleshko, deputy director of the Odessa region's border troops, said in an interview that Ukraine welcomed the aid and was making progress on the border. ''Of course, we cannot say it is 100 percent sealed,'' he said. ''The United States is a very rich country, and it cannot seal its borders.''

HEADLINE: In Chicago, New Pay Law Is Considered For Big Stores

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN RUETHLING

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 27 

 BODY:
Chicago may become the first city in the nation to require ''big box'' retailers like Wal-Mart or Home Depot to pay employees a ''living wage'' of at least $10 an hour plus $3 an hour in benefits.
 So far, 33 of 50 City Council members have signed on to the proposed ordinance -- more than enough to pass it, perhaps as soon as next month. 
 The bill would affect only stores that have at least 75,000 square feet and are operated by companies with at least $1 billion in annual sales, allowing smaller retailers to continue with the state minimum wage of $6.50 an hour.
 ''This is an effort to try to preserve the middle class,'' said Joe Moore, an alderman from the North Side who sponsored the measure. Mr. Moore called the notion that it would drive retailers out of the city ''hogwash.'' 
 But others say the measure will scare off employers. 
 ''Don't let me be the experiment,'' said Emma Mitts, the alderwoman in the poor and mainly African-American neighborhood of Austin on the West Side, where the city's first Wal-Mart is scheduled to open this year. ''Not at a time when my community needs these jobs so badly.''
 Whether the city has the power to make such demands of certain retailers while exempting others is an open question. The proposal has yet to be reviewed by lawyers, a spokeswoman for the city said.
 David Vite, president and chief executive of the Illinois Retail Merchants Association, said that he thought the state would block such an ordinance and that it seemed unconstitutional because it would discriminate against some businesses. ''To suggest that someone who is a janitor in a retail store should get paid more than a janitor at a bank doesn't make any sense,'' Mr. Vite said.
 But Jennifer Sung, a lawyer with the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, which helped draft the proposal, said the measure would withstand challenges.
 Ms. Sung said courts had ruled that distinctions could be made among industries if there was a rational basis for doing so. She also said that Illinois had granted local governments broad powers to pass regulations to promote a city's health and welfare.
 Similar legislation has been introduced in Washington, D.C., and discussed in New Jersey. Lawmakers in Maryland; Suffolk County, N.Y.; and New York City have passed laws requiring certain large employers to provide health care benefits for workers, but none of those laws have a wage component. 
 If the proposal in Chicago passes, it could mean wage increases for more than 9,000 of the 16,000 or so workers at about 35 big-box stores, according to a study released last year by the Center for Urban Economic Development of the University of Illinois at Chicago.
 The proposal in Chicago comes as such stores have opened in poor neighborhoods.
 ''This ordinance targets the larger retailers who have, over the last probably five years, begun to make some inroads to the inner cities,'' said the Rev. Dwight Gunn, a pastor at Heritage International Christian Church. ''It would continue to push business and development away from the city.'' 
 Mr. Gunn said the ordinance would hinder development in needy neighborhoods on the South and West Sides. The North Side's mostly white neighborhoods, meanwhile, would be less affected, Mr. Gunn said, because they have many major retailers.
 ''The aldermen, I think, have a very difficult choice in the sense that none of them want to be seen as anticommunity, antiworker,'' Mr. Gunn said. 
 Over the next two years, Wal-Mart plans to build more than 50 stores nationwide in city neighborhoods in need of development; the Chicago store scheduled to open in September is the first. ''We have made a pledge to come to urban areas where communities have been ignored and underserved,'' said John Bisio, a spokesman for Wal-Mart. He said such a wage law would not affect plans for the Austin store.
 Some 9,000 people have applied for about 400 jobs at the store in the Austin neighborhood, Mr. Bisio said, even though the opening is more than three months away.

HEADLINE: Building All-Stars With Bricks and Mortar

BYLINE: By Murray Chass

 BODY:
ANDRES REINER is a native of Hungary who gave up his Texas construction company 17 years ago to build the first baseball academy in Venezuela for the Houston Astros. Now that he works for the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, he is back in the construction business.
 ''The organization is under reconstruction,'' the 70-year-old Reiner said.
If Reiner's name isn't familiar, maybe the names Johan Santana, Bobby Abreu, Carlos Guillen, Melvin Mora, Freddy Garcia and Felix Hernandez prompt readier recognition. They and a couple of dozen other major leaguers are products of Reiner's brainstorm. 
 That the Devil Rays will now be the beneficiary of Reiner's expertise is the result of Gerry Hunsicker's change of employers. The Astros' general manager for nine years, Hunsicker is now the Devil Rays' senior vice president for baseball operations. 
 Reiner left the Astros after Hunsicker's departure and went to work last fall for the Cincinnati Reds, whose general manager, Dan O'Brien, was with the Astros when they hired Reiner. But then the Reds fired O'Brien, the Devil Rays hired Hunsicker and Reiner changed jobs, his old boss becoming his new boss.
 These job changes happen in baseball all the time, though. What is not so common is the way Reiner got into baseball.
 ''In the early 80's,'' he said, ''everybody was saying Venezuela only produces one player every 10 years for the major leagues.'' He cited Chico Carrasquel (1950), Luis Aparicio (1956), Dave Concepcion (1970) and Ozzie Guillen (1985).
 ''I was convinced this was not true,'' Reiner said. ''It was the way Venezuela was scouted, and players were brought to the United States without any knowledge of the culture and the language. In 1983 or '84, I prepared a way to do it. I gave it to a couple of my friends with the Pirates, and I gave it to Bill Wood, who was the assistant general manager in Houston.''
 Wood and the Pirates liked the plan, Reiner said, but the Pirates said they didn't have the money to implement it and Wood told him to wait until he had more authority with the Astros.
 ''At that time I had a construction company in Houston,'' Reiner said. ''I was building homes in three subdivisions.''
 Wood became the Astros' general manager at the end of 1987 and soon called Reiner, asking him to update his proposal. He did, and Wood asked him to recommend somebody to oversee the project. 
 ''I gave him a couple of names,'' Reiner recalled, ''and he said: 'No, this won't work. You have to do it.' ''
 Reiner said: ''I had my company. I was building and selling 50, 60 homes a year. I had two kids in the university and one in the last year of high school. I don't know how he convinced me, but my family approved it. I sold my part in the construction company and I started to put together the plan in Venezuela.''
 Now the question arises: How did a native of Hungary living in Texas come to baseball in Venezuela?
 ''After the war, in 1946, my family moved to Venezuela,'' Reiner said. ''I was 11 years old. I lived there until 1980, when I moved to the States. The No. 1 sport in Venezuela is baseball. My wife of 48 years said I was a baseball addict.''
 His addiction led Reiner, as a teenager, to work with a friend who owned a baseball team in Venezuela. His knowledge of the game grew over the years, and when Reiner moved to the United States, he was asked to procure players for the Venezuelan winter league. 
 ''I got more and more involved,'' he said. ''Mainly I learned on the field. There is no better instructor than the game.''
 The baseball academy opened Aug. 1, 1989. Reiner, its director, was paid $8,000 a year. ''That was enough to pay for two and a half semesters of college for my two kids,'' he said. ''This is one of the things I tell the players. You can't think about money. You have to do what you like to do.''
 Reiner, though, had financial reserves from his 35 years in different businesses. ''Economically, I was solid,'' he said.
 Reiner remained with the Astros for 17 years.
 ''I proved only one thing,'' he said. ''I proved if you have a good scouting and development program, you can find players anywhere. The problem in the baseball industry the last 15 years or so has been the free market. The free agency was a disaster for baseball in one way, because there's a lot less money and desire to spend on scouting and development.''
 Reiner said development was the key, even more so than scouting.
 ''I have a good eye, but there's a bunch of scouts who have the same quality of scouting as I have,'' he said. ''The difference is in the development. Development has to improve. The whole industry has to improve the quality of development.''
 With academies in Venezuela and the Dominican Republic, Reiner hopes to do just that in his new construction job.

Sometimes Losing Isn't Fair
 There are inequities in the rules that award victories and losses to pitchers. Most common is the one in which Pedro Feliciano of the Mets can give up a game-tying home run to the Phillies in his one inning of work on Wednesday night, then have the Mets score the go-ahead run in the next half inning, making him the winning pitcher in a 5-4 victory. 
 That's the way Elroy Face gained many of his 18 victories for Pittsburgh in 1959, and that's how Phil Regan got his nickname, the Vulture, when he pitched for the Cubs in the late 1960's.
 But how about the loss that Ryan Madson was charged with in the Phillies' 9-8 loss to the Mets in 16 innings on Tuesday night? Madson entered the game at the start of the ninth inning and pitched into the 16th, allowing no runs and three hits in seven innings through the 15th. He threw 104 pitches without giving up a run. His 105th pitch beat him.
 By keeping the Mets scoreless, Madson gave the Phillies seven innings in which to score the go-ahead run, or runs. But they didn't score, and Carlos Beltran led off the Mets' 16th with a game-winning home run.
 ''That was outstanding, coming out of the bullpen and pitching like that,'' the Mets' Julio Franco said. ''Somebody has to lose, and I'm glad they did. But the guy did an outstanding job. He pitched excellent.''
 The only thing Madson had to show, though, was a lower earned run average (6.95 to 5.98).
 ''Not really,'' said Franco, the ancient Met. ''He showed the manager he can pitch.''

Indians Watch Solo Act
 Granted, complete games are an endangered species, but in the space of six days recently, C. C. Sabathia of Cleveland pitched two of them, matching the season total achieved by three American League teams and exceeding the totals of the other 10 teams. 
 Sabathia, whose first and second starts of the season came a month apart because of an abdominal strain, pitched a three-hitter against Pittsburgh on May 19 and a six-hit shutout against Minnesota on Wednesday in his sixth start. He has a 4-1 record and a 1.52 E.R.A.

Robinson Makes Tough Call
 If there's no crying in baseball, someone forgot to tell Frank Robinson.
 Robinson, the Washington Nationals' manager, became emotional and cried after Thursday's game when he talked about his removal of catcher Matthew LeCroy during the seventh inning. Houston had stolen seven bases and had runners at first and second in a 7-5 game.
 Robinson has no problem with LeCroy as a player, but LeCroy was primarily a designated hitter in the American League for a reason. That the Nationals signed LeCroy as a free agent makes no sense. No wonder Robinson is not ecstatic about the way General Manager Jim Bowden put the team together.
 Robinson didn't want to remove LeCroy in the middle of an inning, but he feared more stolen bases, more throwing errors (LeCroy already had two) and more runs. In removing him that way, Robinson felt he had humiliated LeCroy, something he never wanted to do to. It brought him to tears. 

Measuring Up to Ruth
 As long as he has been moving in slow motion to pass Babe Ruth on the home run list, Barry Bonds may want to consider contributing to a fund that is raising money that the Babe Ruth Museum will use to renovate Ruth's birthplace in Baltimore.
 Not that anyone should suggest to Bonds how he should spend part of his $22 million salary, but for only $714,000, a mere 3 percent of his salary, he could fund the entire project. 
 The Ruth museum announced its fund-raising drive Thursday, the 71st anniversary of the date Ruth hit his last three home runs. He saved the best for last. No. 714 was a majestic drive, the first hit over the right-field roof at Forbes Field in Pittsburgh.
 Fifteen years would pass before someone hit another ball over the right-field roof. In contrast to the bulky Ruth, the player who did it, the Pirates' Ted Beard, was a little guy, 5 feet 8 inches and 165 pounds.
 ''The first time up that game I hit a line drive to second base, and the second baseman caught it,'' the 85-year-old Beard recalled recently. ''Then I hit a line drive to right field, and the right fielder caught it. The third time I got it over the roof. I didn't know it would go over the roof. I thought it would go in the upper deck. It was a pretty good shot for a little guy like me.''
 Beard, who lives near Indianapolis, said one of his teammates, Ray Mueller, a catcher, also saw Ruth hit his over-the-roof homer. Mueller was a rookie with the Boston Braves in 1935.

HEADLINE: Swords and Shouts Next Door, but Don't Call 911

BYLINE: By COREY KILGANNON

 BODY:
''You're looking for the samurais?'' said the girl sitting in the hallway. ''They're up there.''
 She pointed up a staircase to a small gym on the top floor of Jan Hus Church on East 74th Street. Inside was a startlingly surreal scene, especially to someone stepping off the streets of the Upper East Side, where people were picking up dry cleaning and lounging at sidewalk cafes on a Saturday evening.
Upstairs, the old church gym resembled an ancient Japanese battleground. Some 50 people in Japanese warrior dress -- dark robes, heavy chest armor and helmets with fearsome face-cages -- hurled bloodcurdling screams as they beat one another over the head with poles. 
 The gym's door, though closed, hardly stifled the screams or contained the thunderous stomping that rumbled the building itself. Even residents of neighboring high-rises have grown accustomed to the boisterous practices held three evenings a week by the New York City Kendo Club, a tight-knit group of urban samurais who have made this gym their home dojo for a quarter-century.
 The club was founded in 1976 by Noboru Kataoka, a world-renowned kendo sensei. To honor its 30th anniversary, the club is holding a kendo tournament today at John Jay College of Criminal Justice on the West Side, where kendo practitioners from around the world will compete.
 Mr. Kataoka's students tend to follow his teachings religiously. Whatever their profession -- sanitation men battle architects, lawyers fight film producers and teachers face off with editors -- they say the ancient principles of the samurai warrior help them cut through the complexities of the modern urban environment.
 There is the money manager who credits kendo with keeping him sharp when making crucial investment decisions. There is the architect who says kendo enables him to handle high-pressure projects and harrowing deadlines. There is the Brooklyn woman who sleeps with her kendo sword next to her bed for security.
 ''From the moment you set foot in this dojo, you are a New York samurai,'' said Jose Pena, 51, who has been studying with Mr. Kataoka three days a week for the past 27 years. ''It may be 2006, but we still follow the way of the warrior.''
 Mr. Pena studies Japanese culture and travels regularly to Japan to take advancement tests in the kendo rankings known as dans. He is currently in the sixth dan and is already looking forward to returning in 2011 for the test to enter the seventh dan, the second-highest rank.
 The money manager, Raymond Stewart, said he started learning kendo 25 years ago to help him handle his stressful finance job on Wall Street.
 ''I manage more than $200 million and have to make the right decision about what to do with it,'' he said. ''Kendo teaches you to wait for the right moment and then strike with total conviction.'' 
 The club's members competing today are entered under smaller teams with names such as the Spare Ribs, the Wild Bunch and Cutie Honey.
 One member of Cutie Honey is Kyung Kim, 33, a teacher from Elmhurst who joined the club three years ago after seeing kendo only occasionally on television.
 ''I'm very sensitive emotionally, and I needed mental discipline in my life,'' she said at David Copperfield's, a pub at York Avenue and 74th Street, where the club gathers with Mr. Kataoka for drinks after class.
 When Mr. Kataoka first came to New York from Japan, he began renting teaching space in various dance studios downtown, but found them too flimsy for kendo practice. Three broken wooden floors and one shattered wall mirror later, he found Jan Hus Church. Its floor was strong, but its neighbors were unaccustomed to the screaming and commotion of kendo. Several times, police officers were called to the gym.
 ''They would come busting in the door, and then stop and look and say, 'Oh, kendo,' '' he said. Yelling is a crucial part of kendo, he explained, a sign that the stomach and chest muscles are joining in the power of the strike.
 ''This where the strength comes from,'' he said, holding his belly. ''We yell to bring the power up from here. The more years you train, the better you can yell. It's like an opera singer.''
 At practice last week, each newcomer suited up methodically in dark robes. Each donned a chest plate and wrapped his head in a bandanna emblazoned with Japanese characters depicting various aspects of kendo. Then the helmet, its wire face mask menacing and its epaulet flaps flaring out like the Flying Nun's habit, to protect the shoulders.
 Kendo is done in bare feet and the footwork is short, choppy and quick. Each student uses a bamboo-slatted staff known as a shinai. The students line up to spar with the senior members of the class. The players meet and cautiously cross the tips of their swords and begin parrying for the smallest of openings through which to strike. Then they rush at each other with a powerful gallop, holding their swords above their head with both hands and striking down.
 Mr. Kataoka demonstrated how to push the opponent's sword, causing the opponent to push back and thus create an imbalance: an opening.
 ''If you don't have technique, all you have left is power, muscle,'' said Mr. Kataoka, 57, who teaches with grace and an economy of words and movement. He also gets occasional work as an actor under the name Ken Kensei, including a part in an upcoming film directed by Clint Eastwood, ''Red Sun, Black Sand.'' 
 His wife, Mami Kataoka, 42, was also at practice. She has been practicing kendo since age 11 and has reached the fourth dan. She had just flown in from Japan, and after weeks of separation, the spouses reunited not by embracing, but by exchanging blows to the head and shoulders.
 After practice, Mr. Kataoka took out a steel sword and knelt down next to it, to demonstrate a 400-year-old art of drawing the sword, known as iaido. Mr. Kataoka is a 20th-generation master of the form, having studied it since childhood with a premier sensei in Japan. 
 His eyes almost closed, he went through a routine of highly stylized movements, repeatedly sheathing and unsheathing the sword. It whistled through air as it sliced through imaginary opponents in some ancient battle.
 Then he put on his Los Angeles Angels jacket and walked out into the quiet night of East 74th Street.

HEADLINE: Mixed Success In Yonkers

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS; Jo Craven McGinty contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: YONKERS 

 BODY:
The matching town houses on Gaffney Place and Trenchard Street along this city's East Side -- with their brick siding, peaked roofs and well-tended front yards -- were once a prominent set of addresses in one of the country's more ambitious social experiments: the court-ordered effort to desegregate Yonkers, the fourth-largest city in New York.
 After a bitter, drawn-out legal battle, black families from the city's housing projects began moving into the town houses and into the heart of one the city's white working-class neighborhoods.
 For many, these town houses -- known as the Andrew Smith Townhouses -- were seen as the embodiment of an enemy invasion, a planted flag in the city's long and nasty war over race, jobs, schools and housing. 
 Today, 14 years later, Mary Delphina Paige, who left one of the city's most dangerous housing projects in 1992 with her daughter, Jessica, and son, Eric, and moved into what then was the new house at 111 Gaffney Place, says the experiment was, with some hardships, a triumph. She said it had given her the chance to raise her children in safety. For instance, Jessica, 23, is now working and saving to go to nursing school. Eric, 27, is now married, with one son.
 Yvette Smith, who lives at 123 Trenchard Street, said that in the early years she had been met with epithets and cold stares, and has never felt completely at home. Still, her children have lived a life they might not have been afforded in the projects. 
 ''Moving here gave me peace of mind to raise my kids,'' she said.
 Although, for her, there were limits to the success. ''I still have this uneasy feeling that people just don't want us here,'' she added.
 Kristina Meola, who is white and lives just outside the boundaries of the Andrew Smith Townhouses in a spacious two-story home that has been in her husband's family for five decades, said there was indeed trepidation about the arrival of blacks and Hispanics from the projects. Some neighbors sold their houses and moved away. Others simply kept their distance. Yet, she said, the worst fears had not been realized.
 ''I think people were worried that we would now become the urban look instead of the suburban look that we are,'' Mrs. Meola said. ''But it didn't happen.'' 
 The exact truth of what has happened since the first units of low-income housing went up in East Yonkers is open to interpretation. There have been few formal or rigorous studies -- none broad, and certainly none definitive.
 The bare-bone facts of the experiment were these: 200 town houses were built in the mostly white neighborhoods east of the Saw Mill River Parkway. Another 600 housing units intended for people with modest incomes have over the years been scattered around the East Side, and the final ones are scheduled to be completed this summer.
 According to the Municipal Housing Authority, 58 of the first 200 families to move into the town houses are still living there, 9 of those at Andrew Smith. Among those first 200 families, there were some problems: 40 have been evicted and 17 have returned to the projects. Yet city statistics indicate that a disaster did not occur. Crime rates in the still largely white neighborhood have not gone up. The prices of homes have not plunged, although they also have not risen as much as in the rest of Westchester County during the latest housing boom.
 But seen most broadly, the experiment also did not lead to any remaking of the city's overall population or substantially alter the great, hard divides of where whites and blacks live. Census figures show the number of whites on the East Side decreased by about 12 percent in the 1990's, but whites remain 82 percent of the area's overall population. And in the southwest quadrant, where about 7,000 units of public housing are concentrated, most in high-rise and aged projects, the population remains 81 percent black and Hispanic.
 ''Our expectations were higher than what reality turned out to be,'' said Peter Smith, executive director of the housing authority, which oversees the public housing stock in Yonkers, which has a population of 200,000.
 In interviews over several months, families in the Trenchard Street town houses and some of their neighbors spoke about the experience. Some told of living separate lives. In fact, some tenants spoke of feeling isolated, somewhat stranded and no more rooted in the community than before.
 But they do feel safe.
 ''I remember the big rats in the projects, the dog fights on the basketball court,'' said Leda Corea, 25, who was 11 when she moved from the William A. Schlobohm Houses in southwestern Yonkers to a town house at Andrew Smith, across the street from Mary Paige. ''I remember running to my apartment from the bus stop and making absolutely no eye contact with anyone until I got into my room. I was so afraid.''
 Ms. Corea continued: ''Here, it's different. I never had to worry that I'd be hit by a stray bullet or chased on the street.''
 It was that sense of safety and opportunity that first struck Mary Paige as she walked into her new town house on Gaffney Place in the summer of 1992.
 The development is one of seven public housing sites built in East Yonkers between 1992 and 1994, the result of the lawsuit that charged that Yonkers had intentionally segregated its public housing and schools along racial lines. 
 The schools agreed to put a desegregation plan in place, but desegregating the housing proved to be an arduous, costly and divisive endeavor that took the city to the brink of bankruptcy.
 Those who arrived at Andrew Smith with Ms. Paige that first day recalled that the block resembled a college campus on move-in day, electric with people hauling their possessions in boxes, trunks and suitcases into their 24 new homes.
 Ms. Paige's home, like the homes of her neighbors, had a fenced-in backyard, an eat-in kitchen and a staircase with turned banisters.
 Through the years, Ms. Paige has filled the walls there with pictures, diplomas and certificates of achievement, including a Children's Choice Award that she received in 1993 from the students at Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School downtown, where she has worked as an aide and bus matron for 18 years.
 ''Moving here was like finding a pot of gold at the end of a rainbow,'' Ms. Paige said. 
 Her new home and neighborhood were a world away from Schlobohm, the menacing cluster of eight public high-rises they came from. Jessica Paige, who was 8 when her family moved to the town houses, remembers turning to her mother and asking, in amazement, ''Is this ours?''
 Yvette Smith, 37, a social worker who moved into a nearby town house that same day, was also impressed. But there was something else that caught her eye: a racial epithet scrawled on a wall. 
 ''Let me put it this way: It wasn't a warm welcome,'' Ms. Smith said bluntly over dinner at her town house on Trenchard Street, where she lives with her son, Daryl, 13, and youngest daughter, Darial, 17.
 Throughout East Yonkers, residents were still fuming that the city had bowed to Judge Leonard B. Sand of Federal District Court and his order in 1985 requiring desegregation. They had staged rallies and packed City Council meetings, making remarks that made headlines across the country. 
 But with fines imposed by Judge Sand doubling each day that Yonkers failed to comply with the order, city officials relented and the town houses were built. 
 The resentment, though, lingered, Ms. Smith said. She remembers the woman who used to let her dog defecate in front of the town houses, never cleaning upthe mess. There was a man with a thick accent who often accosted tenants and asked if they were on welfare.
 Fifteen years later, chimes dangle from windows and a wooden sunflower adorns one yards. Flowers bloom in clay pots. There is hardly a scrap of litter in sight.
 By all appearances, life in the town houses is decidedly middle class.
 But not all the stories are happy. A young mother was kicked out after her boyfriend killed a woman on the other side of town. Another woman lost her home when her live-in companion set it on fire. 
 And 16 original families who were evicted from their new homes were pushed out simply because they could not pay their gas and electricity bills, according to Mr. Smith of the housing authority.
 The few researchers who have studied the Yonkers experiment -- from Columbia and Johns Hopkins University -- did not reach broad conclusions.
 But they did say that the new housing helped residents cultivate positive attitudes toward school and work, and that the young people who had moved to the town houses were more likely than those who stayed in the projects to think that education was a route to good jobs.
 However, the studies, as well as interviews conducted in recent weeks, also hint at the limited extent of the triumphs.
 A fuller, deeper integration did not occur -- in part, some residents and experts say, because of the simultaneous effort to desegregate the schools. The judge's order did away with neighborhood schools, so children were -- and still are -- bused to all parts of the city, making it hard for their parents to meet and make friends in the neighborhoods in which they live. 
 In the neighborhoods, residents still keep their distance. At the playground opposite the Andrew Smith Townhouses, black and white children play together almost as rarely as the adults socialize. Ms. Smith said that most of her neighbors in the private homes would greet her, but only if she greeted them first.
 Outside the town houses, white residents were reluctant to talk about their experiences. When they did, they would give only their first names, or brush off the issue, saying any problems were a thing of the past.
 The mayor of Yonkers, Philip A. Amicone, said the battle over the housing ''was an unfortunate chapter in our history, but we have turned the page.''
 The Meola family acknowledged that opposition to the town houses had been fierce. Michael J. Meola, 34, a supervisor at the Yonkers Parks Department, grew up in the house on Gaffney Place that he now shares with his wife of seven years, Kristina, and their three young children.
 He said he now regrets joining some of the protests against the public housing, including a vigil at the lot set aside for the Andrew Smith houses where an effigy of Judge Sand was burned. But the opposition to the housing ''had more to do with economics than it had to do with race,'' Mr. Meola said. 
 ''People were afraid that the homes they worked so hard to buy,'' he added, ''were going to be worth nothing after the town houses were built.''
 But after the families moved in, Mr. Meola said: ''I don't remember it ever being a big problem. They moved in and we moved on. We wave at them, they wave at us, but that's about it.''
 Jessica Paige graduated on May 12 from the Sanford-Brown Institute in White Plains with a certificate in medical assistance and is working at a doctor's office, hoping to save enough to finance her next endeavor, nursing school.
 Xavier de Souza Briggs, an associate professor of sociology and urban planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, spent four years studying the desegregation in Yonkers.
 ''There are people who look at these desegregation efforts and say, 'Well, unless desegregation produces real evidence that kids are more likely to go to high school and go to college, that parents will make more money, what's the point of going through all the trouble?' '' he said. ''But to me, if you're able to reduce the levels of stress, if you're able to make quality-of-life improvements, that's a major victory.'' 
 Ms. Paige agreed. ''To this day, I pray every night and I ask the Lord to bless my home,'' she said. ''It's by the grace of God that me and my family left the projects.''

HEADLINE: Violence Poses Challenge For Club Security Industry 

BYLINE: By KAREEM FAHIM and SARAH GARLAND; Andrew Jacobs contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
The gatekeepers of nightclubs in Manhattan remember Stephen Sakai, a fellow bouncer who is accused of shooting four patrons last week at the club where he worked, killing one man and gravely injuring two others.
 He seemed professional, a few people said, and not seemingly disposed to the violence he is now charged with. He had no criminal record and worked at an upscale club for Excalibur Security, one of the agencies that have come to dominate nightlife security in recent years.
Because of all that, Mr. Sakai's case presents a challenge to an industry that has taken pains to show how much it has changed in the past decade.
 ''Once in a while, people slip through the cracks,'' said Carlos Robinson, who is in charge of security for Lotus, an upscale club on West 14th Street. ''It's not 1992 anymore. It was rough back then.'' 
 A bouncer who works at a different club in the meatpacking district, and who would only give his first name, Dave, said, ''We're not violent.'' 
 He added: ''We're trying to get out of that bouncer of the old days, who beat people up. We're trying to be professional, customer-service oriented.''
 Whether there has been any change in the practices of the nightlife security guards, as many now prefer to be called, the industry has attracted scrutiny of late. Another bouncer, Darryl Littlejohn, is accused of raping and killing Imette St. Guillen, a graduate student who visited a SoHo bar where Mr. Littlejohn worked the night before her body was found in Brooklyn on Feb. 25.
 Though Mr. Sakai, 30, who is also being investigated in three other homicides, and Mr. Littlejohn, 41, have proclaimed their innocence, they have projected a picture -- of well-built, imposing men for whom cultivating an aura of militancy was almost a leisure pursuit -- that their colleagues minding the doors are now anxious to tear down.
 In his spare time, Mr. Littlejohn's neighbors say they saw him wear bullet-resistant vests and fatigues. In a jailhouse interview on Friday with The Daily News and The New York Post, Mr. Sakai admitted that he had carried a gun in his waistband the night of the shooting outside Opus 22, a club at West 22nd Street and 11th Avenue. But he denied that he was the one who fired the shots.
 Dick Hobbs, a professor at the London School of Economics who wrote a book about bouncers in England, said that a bustling nightclub scene there had created a shadow police force, staffed by burly working-class men who felt misunderstood by the patrons they interacted with.
 ''It's a real body culture,'' he said. ''Martial arts and boxing were prevalent.'' Like police officers, the bouncers in interviews often characterized the public in terms of their violent potential, he said. ''They were the gladiators out there.''
 Bouncers interviewed this week said they know men in their business who wear bullet-resistant vests or carry guns, but they said that those people were in the minority. Club owners today are looking for well-dressed, polite security guards who talk their way through tense situations rather than use force. 
 But Javier Gomez, who works with NEC Security Consultants, a group that represents about 70 bouncers, said that because of the dangers, the business still attracts men who are trained to fight. ''In some ways, our job is more difficult than the cops','' he said. When the police arrive, a bar fight is usually over, he said.
 In Chelsea, home to many of the city's popular nightclubs, the bouncers hold sway, keeping order among thousands of clubgoers. 
 In 2001, there were eight venues with cabaret licenses concentrated in a four-block area of Chelsea, said Capt. Stephen Hughes, the commanding officer of the 10th Precinct, which includes the neighborhood. Today, he said, there are 21. ''That's an extra 9,500 people coming into this area,'' he said. ''That's not 10,000 churchgoers,'' he added, saying that just under one-fifth of all the major crimes in the neighborhood this year have occurred in nightclubs.
 Some clubs hire as many as 60 security guards on a busy night, he said, adding that the majority of bouncers perform their jobs well, especially by keeping weapons out of the bars. They typically earn $100 to $150 a night.
 Four clubs in the area have been cited for hiring security guards who are not licensed by the state, Captain Hughes said.
 Mr. Sakai did have the state license, which requires a state and federal criminal history check and an eight-hour training course. Mr. Littlejohn, an ex-convict, did not have his license, and the state liquor board has filed charges against the bar where he worked. 
 Security agencies can add a layer of scrutiny to the hiring process, said Michael A. Giraldo, a spokesman for Excalibur Security, one of the larger agencies. Mr. Giraldo hires a fraction of the bouncers he interviews every month, looking for those with ''verbal judo'' skills, he said.
 ''Often, people at clubs are controlled by alcohol or drugs,'' he said. ''You've got to keep yourself at a higher level, and talk someone down.'' 
 But the security firms charge higher rates for their bouncers than clubs would have to pay freelancers. 
 ''A lot of the newer places think they can do it themselves,'' said John Blair, who runs Spirit, a nightclub in Chelsea. ''The big security agencies are very good, and very expensive,'' he said. Among veterans of the nightlife industry like Mr. Blair, experienced security guards get passed around by word of mouth, he said.
 But sometimes, the security agencies are the problem. Law enforcement officials said that Mr. Sakai was associated with the Untouchables, an ad hoc group of security guards started by Edwin Mojica. The group is the subject of a half dozen lawsuits by patrons injured at clubs that employed the Untouchables. 
 Mr. Mojica was shot to death in Brooklyn last year, one of the killings for which Mr. Sakai is now being investigated.
 Excalibur runs security at Opus 22, and hired Mr. Sakai at the request of the owners, who had previously worked with him, said Mr. Giraldo. 
 ''We were reluctant, but because it was the owner's request, we took him on,'' he said. ''He was very professional -- courteous, respectful. I look for temperament and common sense. He seemed fine.''
 Edward Lee, the club's owner, did not immediately respond yesterday to telephone messages left for him at the club.
 The world of bouncers is not to blame for what happened, Mr. Giraldo said. ''If he would have worked at Baskin-Robbins, he would have done the same thing.''

HEADLINE: Are Enrons Bustin' Out All Over?

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
CHIEF executives everywhere probably breathed a sigh of relief last week when the Enron verdicts came in. With Kenneth L. Lay, the company's former chairman, and Jeffrey K. Skilling, its former chief executive, found guilty of fraud and other crimes, maybe now we can all move past this corporation-run-amok stuff.Enron, after all, was an anomaly, right? 
 Sorry, pals. Other news from last week showed that the Enron verdicts were, at best, the end of the beginning of this dispiriting corporate crime wave. They were certainly not the beginning of its end.
Last week, for example, investors learned that a throng of former executives at Fannie Mae, the mortgage-financing giant, had cooked the company's books to generate munificent bonuses for themselves. And while this was going on, Fannie's board was AWOL. 
 While Fannie Mae has not been charged with criminal wrongdoing, the 350-page report issued by the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight, or Ofheo, was a gripping and definitive account of the company's $10.6 billion accounting debacle.. The report confirmed that Fannie Mae is, as its spinmeisters say, in ''the American Dream business''-- for its executives, that is. 
 Josh Rosner, an analyst at Graham Fisher & Company, an independent financial research firm in New York, has followed Fannie Mae for years. The report's revelations were disgraceful on several counts, he said.
 First was the disturbing breadth of Fannie Mae's dubious management and accounting practices. ''At Enron, it was really three or four individuals who were intimately involved in the plan and the process and the intent to manipulate,'' he said. ''The number of people who are identified as being problematic here is pretty staggering.''
 More than a dozen executives appear in the report, and Fannie Mae's board also comes in for criticism. ''Every bit of this report says the board was asleep at the switch,'' Mr. Rosner said.
 For example, the Ofheo report noted that the board was advised in 1999 that the company had adjusted its financial statements to burnish its 1998 results. 
 Notes made by J. Timothy Howard, Fannie Mae's chief financial officer, for a January 1999 board meeting stated the following: ''Taking these adjustments now will mean that we can report higher levels of net interest income and guaranty fees over the next year or two. That's one reason we made them.''
 Ofheo found that the adjustments were meant to mislead investors. Perhaps the most shocking tidbit in the Ofheo report was its disclosure that Fannie Mae entered into insurance contracts to help the company keep its losses artificially low. The arrangements had no economic value and did not involve any transfer of risk, as insurance typically does. Instead, the contracts were designed so that they produced a greater benefit to the company if more of its mortgages went into foreclosure.
 ''Fannie Mae was essentially betting against the American dream,'' Mr. Rosner said. ''It is truly disgusting that you had a company entering into a sham transaction that had little economic benefit but that only paid off if more people had their homes foreclosed.'' 
 One of the central players in the manipulation at Fannie Mae, according to the Ofheo report, was Franklin D. Raines, its chief executive from 1999 to 2004. The report said that he not only created an ''unethical and arrogant culture'' at the top of the company, but that more than half of the $90 million in compensation he hauled in between 1998 and 2003 was generated by accounting gimmicks that allowed him to meet bonus targets artificially. 
 Robert Bennett, a lawyer representing Mr. Raines, said in a statement last week that the former chairman ''never authorized, encouraged, or was aware of violations of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) at Fannie Mae for the purpose of smoothing earnings, reaching bonus targets, or for any other improper reason.'' He noted that Mr. Raines had promised that he would hold himself accountable ''if it was determined that Fannie Mae misapplied accounting rules.''
 According to Mr. Bennett's statement, Mr. Raines fulfilled that pledge by ''retiring early'' from Fannie Mae. Volunteering to give back portions of his jury-rigged bonuses was not mentioned as another way to keep his promise. 
 Mr. Rosner said that he found the $400 million fine that Ofheo and the Securities and Exchange Commission leveled against Fannie Mae to settle the company's accounting shenanigans to be disturbingly low. He described the fine as a mere ''toll.'' 
 ''For a $10.6 billion minimum restatement, for them to have to pay $400 million, you may as well tell people 'you can lie and here's the dollar figure per lie,' '' Mr. Rosner said.
 After the report came out, Daniel H. Mudd, Fannie Mae's chief executive said: ''We are glad to resolve these matters. We have all learned some powerful lessons here about getting things right and about hubris and humility. We are a much different company than before. But we also recognize that we have a long road ahead of us.''
 TWO days later, the Enron verdicts were announced. That was also when Thomas J. Lehner, director of public policy for the Business Roundtable, was testifying on Capitol Hill in defense of current practices in executive compensation. Mr. Lehner reiterated the Business Roundtable's belief that executive pay at most American companies is justified and expressed opposition to legislation that would allow shareholders to approve compensation plans.
 Mr. Lehner's testimony brought back memories from November 2003, when the Business Roundtable announced what it called an important initiative on executive pay. Mr. Raines, who was chairman of the roundtable's Corporate Governance Task Force, said at that time: ''Executive compensation should reward success and not reward failure.''
 Do as I say, not as I do?
 Yes, the long and sorry story of Enron is nearing a close. Unfortunately, questionable corporate practices continue apace. There is obviously much work to be done -- by prosecutors and shareholders -- before we can be sure that other Enrons will not happen. 
 Prosecutors know what trails to follow. Shareholders, less accustomed to taking such an active role, may not be as certain. 
 They should begin by holding directors accountable for trouble that occurs on their watch. They should demand that executives forfeit compensation generated by fraudulent practices. And they must hold their mutual fund managers responsible for proxy voting practices that encourage excessive pay and cozy, somnambulant boards. If these managers don't vote against directors who hand out oversized pay for undersized performance, they are part of the problem and should be fired. 
 As the Enron jury eloquently told us last week, silence in the face of these offenses gives consent.

HEADLINE: The Other Legacy Of Enron

BYLINE: By ALEX BERENSON

 BODY:
WITH Thursday's conviction of Kenneth L. Lay and Jeffrey Skilling, the books have finally closed on Enron, almost five years after the company's collapse. The guilty verdict is a resounding repudiation of the accounting gimmickry that swept through corporate America during the 1990's. With the former top executives of a half-dozen big public companies in, or headed for, prison for financial fraud, executives today appear more cautious about pushing accounting limits.
 Yet in another, more fundamental way, Enron lives on. 
 Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling built and championed a culture of trading, a belief that markets could and should price every product and service. Despite its notorious swagger, Enron failed repeatedly as it tried to build these new markets. 
 Even so, the company came to symbolize the transition to a world where practically anything can be traded, from weather predictions to broadband Internet connections to forecasts involving the housing market. Enron's vision played out disastrously in California in spring 2001, when manipulation in the state's newly deregulated electricity market helped cause recurring blackouts and soaring power costs. Nine months later, for reasons largely unrelated to the crisis in California, Enron had collapsed, leaving thousands of employees out of work and setting off a wave of prosecutions that culminated in Thursday's verdicts.
 But just as junk bonds have thrived in the 16 years after the collapse of Drexel Burnham Lambert and Michael Milken's guilty plea for securities fraud, the culture of trading has only become more important since the California blackouts and Enron's bankruptcy.
 For many Americans, the growth of these new markets, with their potential for manipulation and abuse, can seem alarming. Yet many economists and financial experts say that when markets work as they should, they can give individuals protection against the risks of the modern economy -- at a price. 
 For better or worse, the trend toward deregulation and freer markets is not likely to reverse anytime soon in the United States.
 ''Enron did pioneer a lot of concepts that will be here with us for a long time to come -- the trading of commodities that had never been traded before,'' said James Chanos, a hedge-fund manager. Mr. Chanos was among the first investors to say publicly that Enron was a house of cards propped up by fraudulent accounting. ''There won't be any going back to saying we won't trade electricity.''
 Wholesale markets for oil, power and other commodities are bigger and more vigorous than ever. Companies and financiers continue to search for new ways to protect themselves from, or take advantage of, the risk of unexpected variations in price. 
 ''It has been forgotten, because of the unfortunate things that happened at the top, that Enron had a good group of people who were very innovative,'' said Robert Shiller, an economics professor at Yale University whose 2000 book ''Irrational Exuberance'' predicted the stock market crash. 
 Just last week, in fact, a company co-created by Mr. Shiller began trading contracts that reflect the value of housing markets in 10 major American cities. Homes make up all or almost all of the net worth of most American families, and their value has soared in recent years. But average Americans cannot easily protect themselves from broad downturns in housing markets.
 The contracts offered by Mr. Shiller's company, which are traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, aim to allow homeowners to protect themselves from regional downturns without having to sell their homes and moving into rentals. In essence, the contracts are a way to move the risk of housing markets away from individual homeowners and onto people or companies willing to take it on.
 For example, investors could buy a contract that will gain value if the local market skids, but be worthless if the market rises. In essence, the buyer would be giving up some potential appreciation in return for protection against a falling market. 
 At their best, new markets can provide efficient new forms of insurance, enabling people or businesses to transfer risks they cannot control -- for a fee, of course.
 A contract whose value fluctuates with the weather may seem farfetched. But it could have practical use. A farmer might buy a contract that would only pay off in a year of below-normal rainfall, protecting him from the crop damage produced by a drought. 
 ''The advent of insurance made all kinds of businesses possible,'' Mr. Shiller said. ''The idea that you can manage these risks can make all kinds of businesses possible that wouldn't happen otherwise.'' 
 Of course, for markets to work, every buyer must be matched with a seller, and sometimes one side gains too much market power. In the California electricity crisis, power producers were able to bring the state to its knees when they realized that they could cause prices to soar by withholding only small amounts of electricity, said Dr. Frank Wolak, a professor at Stanford.
 For markets to be successful, both sides must be able to adjust to changing conditions, Dr. Wolak said. A lingering imbalance still hampers electricity markets in California and nationally, he said.
 No matter what, Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling won't be lionized even by the most fervent believers in the free market , as Mr. Milken is, because the executives were widely viewed as venal and unwilling to accept responsibility for Enron's collapse.
 Mr. Milken has had many supporters, who say he did nothing wrong other than upset sleepy corporate managers by enabling outsiders to launch takeover bids for big companies.
 ''There was a real free market view back then that he was an innovator,'' Mr. Chanos said of Mr. Milken. ''There was a sense that he had unleashed this form of capitalism that heretofore hadn't been available to people.''
 By contrast, said William Hogan, professor of global energy policy at the Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, and a supporter of electricity deregulation, history would not be kind to Enron, Mr. Lay and Mr. Skilling.
 The California electricity crisis and Enron's subsequent collapse set the cause of electricity deregulation back a decade or more, Mr. Hogan said.
 While Enron was only marginally responsible for California's problems, the company generally bent rules wherever it could, trying to create markets where it controlled prices, rather than competing fairly in independently regulated exchanges, he said. Markets work only when they are carefully designed and regulated, not controlled by private companies, Mr. Hogan said.
 ''It's not that you can trade anything for anything with anybody under any circumstances,'' he said, ''though I think Skilling believed that.''

HEADLINE: Thousands Protest Government Corruption in Kyrgyzstan

BYLINE: By ETHAN WILENSKY-LANFORD

DATELINE: BISHKEK, Kyrgyzstan, May 27 

 BODY:
Several thousand protesters demanded an end to organized crime and corruption in government Saturday, as well as a reduction in the powers of President Kurmanbek Bakiyev.
 The protest, the second in a month, comes amid rising dissatisfaction with Mr. Bakiyev, who took over last spring after a popular uprising overthrew his predecessor. Before assuming office, Mr. Bakiyev said he would reform the Constitution to limit the powers of the president, but has not done so. 
The crowd of around 5,000 gathered in the main square of the capital near the presidential offices carrying banners with slogans like ''Constitutional Reforms Through Parliament'' and ''Yes to Democracy, Yes to Reforms!'' The protest was orderly, and a large number of police officers roamed the periphery of the march.
 President Bakiyev has the power to dissolve Parliament, which he has threatened to do, and controls much of the country's media, both of which the protesters object to. But the group also wants to limit so-called family businesses, or enterprises linked to the first family.
 Reports of nepotism under the former president, Askar Akayev, galvanized opposition to his rule and led to his ouster. Mr. Bakiyev is believed to have since taken over many of Mr. Akayev's assets.
 The protesters read a list of demands, which included economic changes designed to address rampant unemployment and poverty in this remote, mountainous country. 
 ''Today, we again give the authorities a deadline,'' said Kubatbek Baibolov, a lawmaker, setting a September target date for a new constitution. ''However, if this time they do not take real steps to meet these demands, we retain the right to insist on the tandem's resignation.''
 Mr. Baibolov was referring to the uneasy power-sharing agreement between Mr. Bakiyev and Prime Minister Felix Kulov. It is unclear how supportive Mr. Kulov is of the opposition, but he has made public statements indicating that he agrees with many of its criticisms of the administration.
 Politics in Kyrgyzstan is tumultuous. Five prominent political figures have been assassinated in Bishkek in the past year, four of whom were elected deputies to Parliament. 
 A reputed mafia kingpin, Rysbek Akmatbayev, was gunned down on May 10 -- a month after he was elected to Parliament. The government did not recognize his election, though, because of pending murder charges against him.
 Mr. Akmatbayev, whose rise to power drew heavy criticism from the United States and Russia, was widely seen as the president's link to organized crime. Analysts say that his death has weakened the opposition by eliminating that perceived link and, with it, a major argument against President Bakiyev.

HEADLINE: What's Wrong With a Healthy Helping of Pork?

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
BEFORE ''earmark'' became a dirty word, Senator John W. Warner might have unabashedly claimed credit for steering $1.5 billion in federal money back home to rebuild the Wilson Bridge, which crosses the Potomac. But at the dedication ceremony this month, Mr. Warner, Republican of Virginia, practically apologized.
 ''There's much said in Congress about building bridges to nowhere,'' the senator said, invoking a bridge in rural Alaska that has become a symbol of federal spending run amok. ''This bridge is a bridge to everywhere, and it is worth every penny.''
Mr. Warner's remarks reflect a new reality in Washington, a city where pork has for decades been the currency of power. Most members of Congress regard bringing home the bacon as an important part of their jobs, not to mention an essential ingredient for re-election. 
 But now earmarks -- Washington lingo for the practice used by lawmakers to slip money into legislation to pay for their pet projects -- have been tainted by scandal, and the public is decrying their effect on the federal deficit.
 What's a self-respecting pork barreler to do? Fight back, of course. After all, members of Congress have the constitutional duty to allocate federal money. And if the appropriations process is a little Darwinian -- every state, Congressional district and city fighting for its firetrucks, parks and bridges -- what choice is there? No other branch of government, lawmakers argue, is better suited to making those decisions. 
 ''I thought this was my constitutional obligation, to make sure that we're getting our fair share,'' said Representative Dave Weldon, a Florida Republican, describing how he brought nearly $10 million to his district years ago to rebuild an air traffic control tower at an airport in Vero Beach. ''I thought we were supposed to fight for the interests of our district.''
 A lot of other members thought that, too -- and still do, even after being forced to defend their spending last week. Representative Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, challenged a string of projects in an attempt to strip them from spending bills. The effort forced a collective look in the mirror, and a whole lot of rationalization. 
 Not that this was a problem. 
 Most, if not all, earmarks survived, including $750 million for the Missouri Forest Foundation (''A program that would utilize wood biomass to produce energy,'' said Representative Jo Ann Emerson, Republican of Missouri) and $400 million to develop a research and environmental education center at the Mystic Aquarium (''Not just moneys that are going for the purchase of fish food and to clean the tanks,'' explained Representative Rob Simmons, Republican of Connecticut).
 The Founding Fathers probably did not envision taxpayer financing of projects like the Missouri Forest Foundation or the Mystic Aquarium when they gave Congress the power of the purse; the federal budget was far too scant back then. But they did recognize that parochial interests would collide with the national interest, and scholars say the instinct to steer money back home -- sometimes at the expense of the greater public good -- is nearly as old as the Republic itself.
 ''Congress is exerting power it has had since 1789,'' said Don Ritchie, the associate historian of the Senate. ''It's not doing anything new.''
 As the federal budget grew, there were more demands on it, and by the early 1800's, Henry Clay envisioned what he called ''The American System,'' a nationwide network of roads, rivers and bridges.
 ''You can see the shadows of earmarks in that earlier era,'' Mr. Ritchie said. Clay, he said, correctly recognized that to get such a project passed, there would have to be ''a little something in it for everyone.'' 
 Today, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service estimates that earmarks account for roughly 2.4 percent of the total $2.75 trillion federal budget. But the use of earmarks has exploded since 1994, when Republicans, whose leaders encouraged them as an aid to re-election, took control of the House.
 That year, the research service reports, Congress approved 4,126 earmarks, accounting for $23 billion in federal spending. By 2000, the figures had jumped to 6,073 and $33 billion; in 2006, there were 13,012 earmarks, costing taxpayers $67 billion. 
 But while earmark opponents like Mr. Flake have railed against them for driving up the federal deficit, it took a corrupt politician, former Representative Randy Cunningham, to give earmarks a really bad name. Last year, Mr. Cunningham pleaded guilty to using earmarks to steer government business to a defense contractor in exchange for $2.4 million in bribes, which he collected in the form of a Rolls-Royce, antiques and a sweetheart real estate deal.
 His conviction may be why Representative Deborah Pryce, Republican of Ohio, complains about ''unjustifiable embarrassing pork,'' while also arguing that her own earmarks, like the $97 million she secured for a floodwall in West Columbus, are perfectly reasonable.
 ''I think it's important for the federal government to have the input of legislators who live in the districts,'' Ms. Pryce said. ''I'm not sure the Army Corps of Engineers would have made as strong a case for a floodwall in West Columbus as I would have.''
 Indeed, earmark defenders say it is the job of Congress -- not the bean-counters at the Office of Management and Budget -- to determine how tax dollars should be spent. 
 ''Excuse me,'' Mr. Weldon said, ''but I don't think I was elected to come here and just bow down to the White House and the O.M.B. when it comes to spending priorities.''
 Earmark opponents counter that money gets allocated based not on need, but on how much power a particular member of Congress wields. And Mr. Flake says any special project can be justified on the grounds of economic development. 
 ''If you accept the premise that we ought to be funding items like the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, then you can make a case that it ought to go through the Congress rather than the executive branch,'' he said. ''But if you don't accept the premise, which I don't, then it's a red-herring argument.''
 Still, some view earmarks as the great equalizer. Senator Trent Lott, the former Republican leader from Mississippi, is among them. ''I come from one of the two or three poorest states in the nation,'' Mr. Lott said. ''How could I possibly defend not trying to help people who have not been aggressive in pursuing their fair share?''
 So despite the earmark to-do, lawmakers this campaign season are still heralding news of all the federal money they are bringing home. There is an old joke in Washington: Pork is the money that goes to somebody else's district. 
 Or, as Representative Tom Davis, Republican of Virginia said, ''One man's pork is another man's steak.''


CORRECTION-DATE: June 4, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about earmarks, the legislative practice of setting aside money in spending bills for special projects, included erroneous amounts, based on information in the Congressional Record, for the Missouri Forest Foundation and the Mystic Aquarium in Connecticut. Congress approved $750,000 for the forest foundation, not $750 million; and $400,000 for the aquarium, not $400 million.

HEADLINE: The Cannes Landslide for Al Gore

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH

 BODY:
LET it never be said that the Democrats don't believe in anything. They still believe in Hollywood and they still believe in miracles. Witness the magical mystery comeback tour of Al Gore.
 Like Michael Moore's ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' before it, Mr. Gore's new documentary about global warming, ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' has wowed the liberal caucus at Cannes (who needs landlocked Iowa?) and fueled fantasies of political victory back home. ''Al Gore Takes Cannes by Storm -- Will the Oval Office Be Next?'' Arianna Huffington asks on her blog, reporting that the former vice president was hotter on the Croisette than Tom Hanks, Bruce Willis and Penelope Cruz. In a ''fantasy'' presidential poll on the liberal Web site Daily Kos, Mr. Gore racks up a landslide 68 percent, with the closest also-ran, Russ Feingold, at 15. Liberal Washington pundits wonder whether the wonkishness that seemed off-putting in 2000 may actually be a virtue. In choosing a president, Margaret Carlson writes on Bloomberg.com, maybe ''we should give a rest to that old saw about likeability.'' 
Still, the unexpected rebirth of Al Gore says more about the desperation of the Democrats than it does about him. He is most of all the beneficiary of a perfect storm of events, the right man in the right place at the right time. It was just after Mr. Gore appeared on ''Saturday Night Live'' to kick off his movie's publicity campaign that long-rumbling discontent with the party's presumptive (if unannounced) presidential front-runner, Hillary Clinton, boiled over. Last week both New York magazine and The New Yorker ran lead articles quoting party insiders who described a Clinton candidacy in 2008 as a pox tantamount to avian flu. The Times jumped in with a front-page remembrance of headlines past: a dissection of the Clinton marriage. 
 If Senator Clinton is the Antichrist, might not it be time for a resurrected messiah to inherit (and save) the earth? Enter Mr. Gore, celebrated by New York on its cover as ''The Un-Hillary.''
 There's a certain logic to this. Mrs. Clinton does look like a weak candidate -- not so much because of her marriage, her gender or her liberalism, but because of her eagerness to fudge her stands on anything and everything to appeal to any and all potential voters. Where once she inspired passions pro and con, now she often induces apathy. Her most excited constituency seems to be the right-wing pundits who still hope to make a killing with books excoriating her. At least eight fresh titles are listed at Amazon.com, including my own personal favorite, ''Liberal Fascism: The Totalitarian Temptation From Mussolini to Hillary Clinton.'' (Why settle for Il Duce when you can go for Hitler?) 
 Since no crowd-pleasing Democratic challenger has emerged at this early date to disrupt Mrs. Clinton's presumed coronation, the newly crowned movie star who won the popular vote in 2000 is the quick fix. Better the defeated devil the Democrats know than the losers they don't. Besides, there are at least two strong arguments in favor of Mr. Gore. He was way ahead of the Washington curve, not just on greenhouse gases but on another issue far more pressing than Mrs. Clinton's spirited crusade to stamp out flag burning: Iraq. 
 An anti-Hussein hawk who was among the rare Senate Democrats to vote for the first gulf war, Mr. Gore forecast the disasters lying in wait for the second when he spoke out at the Commonwealth Club in San Francisco on Sept. 23, 2002. He saw that the administration was jumping ''from one unfinished task to another'' and risked letting Afghanistan destabilize and Osama bin Laden flee. He saw that the White House was recklessly putting politics over policy by hurrying a Congressional war resolution before the midterm elections (and before securing international support). Most important, he noticed then that the administration had ''not said much of anything'' about ''what would follow regime change.'' He imagined how ''chaos in the aftermath of a military victory in Iraq could easily pose a far greater danger to the United States than we presently face from Saddam.''
 At the time, the White House professed to ignore Mr. Gore's speech, but on cue in the next five days Condoleezza Rice, Ari Fleischer, Donald Rumsfeld and the president all stepped up the hype of what Mr. Rumsfeld falsely called ''bulletproof'' evidence of links between Saddam and Al Qaeda. Democratic leaders in Congress, meanwhile, blew off Mr. Gore for fear that talk of Iraq might distract the electorate from all those compelling domestic issues that would guarantee victory in the midterms. (That brilliant strategy cost Democrats the Senate.) On CNN, a representative from The New Republic, a frequent Gore cheerleader, reported that ''the vast majority of the staff'' condemned his speech as ''the bitter rantings of a guy who is being politically motivated and disingenuous in his arguments.'' 
 But in truth, as with global warming, Mr. Gore's stands on Iraq (both in 1991 and 2002) were manifestations of leadership -- the single attribute most missing from the current Democrats with presidential ambitions. Of the potential candidates for 2008, only Senator Feingold raised similar questions about the war so articulately so early. The Gore stand on the environment, though still rejected by the president and his oil-industry base, has become a bipartisan cause: 86 evangelical Christian leaders broke with the administration's do-nothing policy in February.
 If this were the whole picture, Mr. Gore would seem the perfect antidote to the Democrats' ills. But it's not. The less flattering aspect of Mr. Gore has not gone away: the cautious and contrived presidential candidate who, like Mrs. Clinton now, was so in thrall to consultants that he ran away from his own administration's record and muted his views, even about pet subjects like science. (He waffled on the teaching of creationism in August 1999, after the Kansas Board of Education struck down the teaching of evolution.) That Gore is actually accentuated, not obscured, by ''An Inconvenient Truth.'' The more hard-hitting his onscreen slide show about global warming, the more he reminds you of how much less he focused on the issue in 2000. Gore the uninhibited private citizen is not the same as Gore the timid candidate. 
 Though many of the rave reviews don't mention it, there are also considerable chunks of ''An Inconvenient Truth'' that are more about hawking Mr. Gore's image than his cause. They also bring back unflattering memories of him as a politician. The movie contains no other voices that might upstage him, not even those of scientists supporting his argument. It is instead larded with sycophantic audiences, as meticulously multicultural as any Benetton ad, who dote on every word and laugh at every joke, like the studio audience at ''Live With Regis and Kelly.'' 
 We are also treated to a heavy-handed, grainy glimpse of Katherine Harris, Michael Moore-style, and are reminded that Mr. Gore is not a rigid blue-state N.R.A. foe (he shows us where he shot his rifle as a farm kid in Tennessee). There's even an ingenious bit of fearmongering to go head to head with the Republicans' exploitation of 9/11: in a worst-case climactic scenario, we're told, the World Trade Center memorial ''would be under water.'' Given so blatant a political context, the film's big emotional digressions -- Mr. Gore's tragic near-loss of his young son and the death of his revered older sister from lung cancer -- are as discomforting as they were in his 1992 and 1996 convention speeches. 
 If ''An Inconvenient Truth'' isn't actually a test drive for a presidential run, it's the biggest tease since Colin Powell encouraged speculation about his political aspirations during his 1995 book tour. Mr. Gore's nondenial denials about his ambitions (he has ''no plans'' to run) are Clintonesque. Told by John Heilemann of New York magazine that his movie sometimes feels like a campaign film, Mr. Gore gives a disingenuous answer that triggers an instant flashback to his equivocation about weightier matters during the 2000 debates: ''Audiences don't see the movie as political. Paramount did a number of focus-group screenings, and that was very clear.'' You want to scream: stop this man before he listens to a focus group again! 
 Even so, let's hope Mr. Gore runs. He may not be able to pull off the Nixon-style comeback of some bloggers' fantasies, but by pounding away on his best issues, he could at the very least play the role of an Adlai Stevenson or Wendell Willkie, patriotically goading the national debate onto higher ground. ''I think the war looms over everything,'' said Karl Rove this month in bemoaning his boss's poll numbers. It looms over the Democrats, too. But the party's leaders would rather let John Murtha take the heat on Iraq; they don't even have the guts to endorse tougher fuel economy standards in their ''new'' energy policy. While a Gore candidacy could not single-handedly save the Democrats from themselves any more than his movie can vanquish ''X-Men'' at the multiplex, it might at least force the party powers that be to start facing some inconvenient but necessary truths.

HEADLINE: 2 Industry Leaders Bet on Coal But Split on Cleaner Approach

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

DATELINE: WRIGHT, Wyo. 

 BODY:
More than a century ago a blustery Wyoming politician named Fenimore Chatterton boasted that his state alone had enough coal to ''weld every tie that binds, drive every wheel, change the North Pole into a tropical region, or smelt all hell!'' 
 His words seem prophetic.
The future for American energy users is playing out in coal-rich areas like northeastern Wyoming, where dump trucks and bulldozers swarm around 80-foot-thick seams at a Peabody Energy strip mine here, one of the largest in the world.
 Coal, the nation's favorite fuel in much of the 19th century and early 20th century, could become so again in the 21st. The United States has enough to last at least two centuries at current use rates -- reserves far greater than those of oil or natural gas. And for all the public interest in alternatives like wind and solar power, or ethanol from the heartland, coal will play a far bigger role. 
 But the conventional process for burning coal in power plants has one huge drawback: it is one of the largest manmade sources of the gases responsible for global warming. 
 Many scientists say that sharply reducing emissions of these gases could make more difference in slowing climate change than any other move worldwide. And they point out that American companies are best positioned to set an example for other nations in adopting a new technique that could limit the environmental impact of the more than 1,000 coal-fired power projects on drawing boards around the world.
 It is on this issue, however, that executives of some of the most important companies in the coal business diverge. Their disagreement is crucial in the debate over how to satisfy Americans' energy appetite without accelerating climate change.
 One of those executives, Michael G. Morris, runs American Electric Power, the nation's largest coal consumer and biggest producer of heat-trapping carbon dioxide emissions from its existing plants. He is spearheading a small movement within the industry to embrace the new technology. His company plans to build at least two 600-megawatt plants, in Ohio and West Virginia, at an estimated cost of as much as $1.3 billion each. 
 The company says these plants are not only better for the environment but also in the best interests of even its cost-conscious shareholders. While they would cost 15 to 20 percent more to build, Mr. Morris says they would be far less expensive to retrofit with the equipment needed to move carbon dioxide deep underground, instead of releasing it to the sky, if limits are placed on emissions of global warming gases. 
 ''Leave the science alone for a minute,'' Mr. Morris said in an interview at the Columbus, Ohio, headquarters of his company. ''The politics around climate issues are very real. That's why we need to move on this now.''
 But most in the industry are not making that bet. Among them is Gregory H. Boyce, chief executive of Peabody Energy, the largest private-sector coal producer in the world thanks in part to its growing operations here in Wyoming and with aspirations to operate coal-fired plants of its own. Mr. Boyce's company alone controls reserves with more energy potential than the oil and gas reserves of Exxon Mobil.
 ''We're still not convinced that the technology or cost structure is there to justify going down a path where we're not comfortable,'' Mr. Boyce said. 
 Mr. Boyce's view has prevailed. No more than a dozen of the 140 new coal-fired power plants planned in the United States expect to use the new approach.
 The decisions being made right now in industry and government on how quickly to adopt any new but more costly technologies will be monumental.
 ''Coal isn't going away, so you have to think ahead,'' said Gavin A. Schmidt, a climate modeler at the Goddard Institute for Space Studies, part of NASA. ''Many of these power stations are built to last 50 years.''

Promise and Perils
 Michael Morris and Gregory Boyce, both kingpins in their industries, have a lot in common. They do a lot of business together -- Mr. Morris is one of Mr. Boyce's largest customers. They are solid Republicans. And they serve together on various industry initiatives.
 They agree that energy from coal -- the nation's most important source of electricity -- is cheaper than energy from oil and natural gas and is competitive with the uranium used in nuclear power plants. And coal could serve new uses: replacing petroleum in making chemicals, for example, or even fueling vehicles. 
 But while sooty smokestacks are no longer a big problem in modern coal-burning power plants, the increase in global warming gases is. A typical 500-megawatt coal-fired electricity plant, supplying enough power to run roughly 500,000 homes, alone produces as much in emissions annually as about 750,000 cars, according to estimates from Royal Dutch Shell.
 Coal has no stronger evangelist than Mr. Boyce, who grew up on Long Island, the son of a mining executive, and studied engineering in Arizona. He argues that a way to reduce carbon dioxide emissions can be found without having to switch from the existing cheaper coal-burning technology. 
 Much in the way that Exxon Mobil influences discussion of climate issues in the oil industry, Peabody is a backer of industry-supported organizations that seek to prevent mandatory reductions in global warming emissions and promote demand for coal. 
 Peabody's executives are also by far the coal industry's largest political contributors to federal candidates and parties, giving $641,059 in the 2004 election cycle, with 93 percent of that amount going to Republicans, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent research group in Washington that tracks money in politics. And while Peabody says it expects contributions to Democrats to increase, under Mr. Boyce the company has cultivated close contact with the Bush administration. 
 Mr. Boyce was chairman of an advisory panel for the Energy Department, organized by the National Coal Council, that produced a controversial report in March calling for exemptions to the Clean Air Act to encourage greater consumption of coal through 2025. The thrust of the report, which Mr. Boyce outlined in an interview, is that improvements in technology to limit carbon dioxide emissions should be left to the market instead of government regulation. 
 By contrast, the environmental advocacy group Natural Resources Defense Council, which has brought many lawsuits aimed at controlling pollution, described the report as an ''energy fantasy'' that would increase carbon dioxide emissions by more than 2 billion tons a year.
 But it is Peabody's economic argument, not the environmental opposition's, that is resonating throughout the electricity industry and among energy regulators. 
 Led by Peabody, dozens of energy companies have embarked on the most ambitious construction of coal-fired electricity plants since the 1950's. 
 Coal, as Mr. Boyce notes, is a bargain. Despite a doubling in domestic prices in the last two years, a surge in prices for natural gas, the preferred fuel for new power plants in the 1990's, has made coal more attractive. 
 With coal so favorably priced, Peabody saw an opportunity to enter the power-plant business itself, setting out to build two of the largest in the world, the 1,500-megawatt Prairie State Energy Campus in southern Illinois and the 1,500-megawatt Thoroughbred Energy Campus in western Kentucky. Both are in areas where the St. Louis-based company has substantial coal reserves. 
 Despite concern among some large energy companies over the liabilities they face if global warming advances or legal limits on emissions become a reality, Peabody remains loyal to its technology choice. Vic Svec, Peabody's senior vice president for investor relations, said the possibility of near-term caps on carbon emissions was not viewed as a ''material threat.''
 Mr. Morris, at American Electric Power, sees things differently. He cites cost concerns in arguing for its move to cleaner technology. At the request of environmental groups that hold shares in the company, A.E.P. agreed in 2004, shortly after Mr. Morris arrived, to report on the potential costs it would face if emissions rules were tightened. The company recognized that its growth beyond 2010 could be limited if it stuck with old technology. 
 The company has since won important allies in its push for cleaner coal, including General Electric, which is pinning much of its hopes for growth in the electricity industry on new technology and is working with A.E.P. on designing its plants. 
 One vital element of A.E.P.'s ambitions, and by extension those of other energy companies with similar projects, fell into place in April when the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio allowed the company to bill customers for a portion of the higher pre-construction costs for the plant it is planning in the state. The company hopes to complete construction of its first such plant by 2010. 
 Proponents of these plants, which turn coal into a gas that is burned to produce energy, say they would also emit much lower amounts of other pollutants that contribute to acid rain, smog and respiratory illness. 
 But for every small advance of the new technology, there are bigger setbacks. Many within the industry argue that it would be a waste of time and money to build such plants in the United States unless China, which passed the United States several years ago as the largest coal-consuming nation, also moves to limit carbon dioxide emissions from its rapidly growing array of coal-fired plants.

Will Government Act?
 With widespread uncertainty in the state-regulated power industry, the debate has moved to the federal level, where testimony by senior energy executives before the Senate Energy Committee in April revealed a sharp fault line within the industry.
 On one side, A.E.P., lined up with Peabody and other heavy coal users against mandatory limits on global warming gases if industrializing countries like China and India are not included. Others that have less to lose from carbon caps -- like Exelon and Duke Energy, which rely much more on nuclear power -- spoke in favor of national limits that would include coal consumers.
 The Bush administration has rejected mandatory limits on carbon dioxide emissions. Michele St. Martin, a spokeswoman for the White House Council on Environmental Quality, said, ''such regulations would lead to higher energy prices, slower economic growth and fewer jobs for the U.S. as industries move overseas where greenhouse gas emissions are not similarly controlled.'' 
 But there is some support in Washington for such legislation. The two senators from New Mexico, Jeff Bingaman, a Democrat, and Pete V. Domenici, a Republican, are working on a bill that could require limits on carbon dioxide emissions.
 Ahead of the 2008 presidential election, two senators often mentioned as candidates, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Democrat of New York, and John McCain, Republican of Arizona, have endorsed mandatory cuts in emissions. Mr. Morris of A.E.P. said such support has persuaded him that limits might be imposed in coming years. 
 While Peabody supports some coal gasification projects, it remains skeptical about departing from traditional coal-burning methods to produce electricity. 
 The pulverized coal plants it wants to build, which grind coal into a dust before burning it to make electricity, currently cost about $2 billion each, or 15 percent to 20 percent less to build than the cleaner ''integrated gasification combined cycle,'' or I.G.C.C., plants, which convert coal into a gas.
 The hope among scientists is that I.G.C.C. plants could be relatively quickly fitted with systems to sequester deep underground the carbon dioxide created from making electricity. Without such controls, the new coal plants under development worldwide could pump as much carbon dioxide into the atmosphere over their lifetimes as all the coal burned in the last 250 years, according to Jeff Goodell, who has written on coal for several publications, including The New York Times, and is author of a new book on the coal industry.
 But state and federal regulators have been hesitant to endorse the technology. Peabody and other companies remain skeptical that carbon-capture methods, whether for pulverized coal or combined cycle plants, will become commercially or technologically feasible until the next decade. 
 Legal battles over this reluctance have begun, with the Natural Resources Defense Council and the American Lung Association this year challenging the Environmental Protection Agency for allowing electric companies to move ahead with projects without evaluating the new technology.
 In one key decision on the state level, the Wisconsin Public Service Commission rejected a proposal from WE Energies of Milwaukee in 2003 to build a plant with the new technology, saying it was too expensive and would result in higher electricity prices.

Capturing the Gas
 Engineers have known how to make gas from coal for more than a century, using this method in the gaslights that first illuminated many American cities. A handful of coal gasification plants are already in operation in the United States, Spain and the Netherlands, built with generous government assistance. 
 Selling the captured carbon dioxide from coal gasification plants could make them more competitive with pulverized coal plants. One gasification plant in North Dakota, though different from an electric plant, already sends its carbon dioxide to Saskatchewan, where it is injected in aging oilfields to force more crude from the ground. And the oil giant BP announced a similar project in March for a refinery it owns near Los Angeles, using petroleum coke as a fuel there instead of coal.
 Scientists have developed numerous other plans to pump away carbon dioxide, like shipping it to offshore platforms to inject it below the ocean floor. These plans are not without risk, with some officials concerned that carbon dioxide sequestration could trigger earthquakes. Yet, time and again, the most limiting factor remains economics.
 As they proceed with plans to build pulverized coal plants, Peabody and other companies often point to their support of the alternative technology through their participation in Futuregen, a $1 billion project started three years ago by the Bush administration to build a showcase 275-megawatt power station that could sequester carbon dioxide and reduce other pollutants.
 Futuregen's 10 members include some of the world's largest coal mining companies, among them Peabody and BHP Billiton of Australia, as well as large coal-burning utilities like A.E.P. and the Southern Company. 
 One Chinese company, the China Huaneng Group, is also a member of Futuregen, while India's government signed on in March. Washington is financing the bulk of the project, more than $600 million, with about $250 million coming from coal and electricity companies and the rest from foreign governments.
 But Futuregen is already behind schedule, with planners now hoping to choose a site for the plant by the end of the year, with an eye on starting operation by 2012. Environmental groups have criticized the project as too little, too late. 
 ''Futuregen is a smokescreen, since it's not intended to bring technology to the market at the pace required to deal with the problem,'' said Daniel Lashoff, science director at the climate center at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ''We don't have that kind of time.''

Both plants emit about 4.5 million tons of carbon dioxide a year, but capturing it at this plant would cost less. Once captured, one option is to pump the carbon dioxide into the ground.

HEADLINE: Iran Chief Eclipses Clerics As He Consolidates Power

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SLACKMAN; Nazila Fathi contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: TEHRAN, May 27 

 BODY:
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is trying to consolidate power in the office of the presidency in a way never before seen in the 27-year history of the Islamic Republic, apparently with the tacit approval of Iran's supreme leader, according to government officials and political analysts here. 
 That rare unity of elected and religious leadership at the highest levels offers the United States an opportunity to talk to a government, however combative, that has often spoken with multiple voices. But if Washington, which severed relations with Iran after the 1979 revolution, opened such a dialogue, it could lift the prestige of the Iranian president, who has pushed toward confrontation with the West.
Political analysts and people close to the government here say Mr. Ahmadinejad and his allies are trying to buttress a system of conservative clerical rule that has lost credibility with the public. Their strategy hinges on trying to win concessions from the West on Iran's nuclear program and opening direct, high-level talks with the United States, while easing social restrictions, cracking down on political dissent and building a new political class from outside the clergy. 
 Mr. Ahmadinejad is pressing far beyond the boundaries set by other presidents. For the first time since the revolution, a president has overshadowed the nation's chief cleric, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, on both domestic and international affairs. 
 He has evicted the former president, Mohammad Khatami, from his offices, taken control of a crucial research organization away from another former president, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, challenged high-ranking clerics on the treatment of women and forced prominent academics out of the university system. 
 ''Parliament and government should fight against wealthy officials,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad said in a speech before Parliament on Saturday that again appeared aimed at upending pillars of the status quo. ''Wealthy people should not have influence over senior officials because of their wealth. They should not impose their demands on the needs of the poor people.''
 In this theocratic system, where appointed religious leaders hold ultimate power, the presidency is a relatively weak position. In the multiple layers of power that obscure the governance of Iran, no one knows for certain where the ultimate decisions are being made. But many of those watching in near disbelief at the speed and aggression with which the president is seeking to accumulate power assume that he is operating with the full support of Ayatollah Khamenei. 
 ''Usually the supreme leader would be the front-runner in all internal and external issues,'' said Hamidreza Taraghi, the political director of the strongly conservative Islamic Coalition Party. ''Here we have the president out front on all these issues, and the supreme leader is supporting him.''
 Mr. Ahmadinejad is pursuing a risky strategy that could offer him a shot at long-term influence over the direction of the country -- or ruin. He appears motivated at least in part by a recognition that relying on clerics to serve as the public face of the government has undermined the credibility of both, analysts here said.
 The changing nature of Iran's domestic political landscape has potentially far-reaching implications for the United States. While Iran has adopted a confrontational approach toward the West, it has also signaled -- however clumsily -- a desire to mend relations. Though the content of Mr. Ahmadinejad's letter to President Bush was widely mocked here and in Washington for its religious focus and preachy tone, it played well to Iran's most conservative religious leaders. Analysts here said it represented both Mr. Ahmadinejad's independence and his position as a messenger for the system, and that the very act of reaching out was significant.
 ''If the U.S. had relations with Iran under the reform government, it would not have been a complete relationship,'' said Alireza Akhari, a retired general with the Revolutionary Guard and former deputy defense minister, referring to Mr. Khatami's administration. ''But if there can be a detente now, that means the whole country is behind relations with the West.''
 Mr. Ahmadinejad is trying to outpace the challenges buffeting Iran, ones that could undermine his presidency and conservative control. The economy is in shambles, unemployment is soaring, and the new president has failed to deliver on his promise of economic relief for the poor. Ethnic tensions are rising around the country, with protests and terrorist strikes in the north and the south, and students have been staging protests at universities around the country.
 Mr. Ahmadinejad's critics -- and there are many -- say that the public will turn on him if he does not improve their lives, and soon. It may ultimately prove impossible to surmount these problems while building a new political elite, many people here said. 
 ''The real issue here is we now have a government with no experience running a country and dealing with foreign policy,'' said Nasser Hadian, a political science professor at Tehran University and childhood friend of the president.
 Mr. Ahmadinejad, who was elected last June, has adopted an ideologically flexible strategy. He has called for restoring the conservative values of the Islamic Revolution, yet at the same time has relaxed enforcement of strict Islamic social codes on the street. During the spring, when the warm weather sets in, young women are often harassed by the volunteer vigilantes known as the Basiji for their dress, but not this year. More music seems to be available in stores than in the past -- small but telling changes, people here say.
 If there is one consistent theme to his actions, it is the concept of seeking justice, reflecting a central characteristic of Shiite Islam. In more temporal terms, his strategy appears to be two-pronged: to reinforce his support among hard-liners with sharp attacks on Israel and the West, for example, while moving to appease a society weary of the social and economic challenges of life in the Islamic republic.
 ''He is reshaping the identity of the elite,'' said a political science professor in Tehran who asked not to be identified so as not to affect his relations with government officials. ''Being against Jews and Zionists is an essential part of this new identity.''
 Mr. Ahmadinejad has been far freer to maneuver than his predecessor, Mr. Khatami, whose movement for change frightened religious leaders. Instead of having to prove his fealty to the system, Mr. Ahmadinejad has been given -- or has taken -- the opportunity to try to calm the streets. Perhaps most surprising, the man who was rumored to want to segregate men and women on elevators and even sidewalks has emerged as a proponent of women's rights, challenging some of the nation's most powerful religious leaders.
 ''I believe Ahmadinejad's government will be the most secular we have had since the start of the revolution,'' said Mahmoud Shamsolvaezin, a journalist and political analyst. ''The government is not a secular one with secular thought. Ahmadinejad is a very religious man. But the government recognizes it has no choice, this is what the public demands.''
 Mr. Ahmadinejad called for allowing women into stadiums, in an attempt to reverse a post-revolution ban when religious leaders decreed that sports arenas were not the proper environment for women. Four grand ayatollahs objected to his decision, but he backed down only when the supreme leader stepped in. Even then, Mr. Ahmadinejad said he was suspending the decision, not canceling it.
 Most significant, during the discussion of the stadium issue, the president defended women in a way that put him outside the mainstream of conservative Islamic discourse, even beyond Iran's borders.
 ''Unfortunately, whenever there is talk of social corruption, fingers are pointed at women,'' Mr. Ahmadinejad said, in comments that for a leader in this society were groundbreaking. ''Shouldn't men be blamed for the problems, too?''
 The president's strategy is also aimed at limiting political challenges to the system. While political arrests are down, and the government has not moved to close privately held newspapers, it has staged a few crucial arrests -- sending a chill through intellectual and academic circles -- and it has pressured newspapers to be silent on certain topics, like opposition to the nuclear program. 
 He also has struck back at those who would undermine or mock him. The local press reported that the president became so incensed with jokes about his personal hygiene that were being exchanged via text messages on cellphones, that he had the messages stopped and people at the top of the cellphone system punished.
 Mr. Ahmadinejad offered voters change and promises to improve the lives of the poor, who make up the majority of this country. But he has been unable to push through economic changes by personal fiat, as he has done in the political realm. He ordered the banks, for example, to lower interest rates, and was rebuffed by the head of the central bank. He offered to give inexpensive housing loans to the poor -- but with only 300,000 available, more than 2 million people applied. The program will cost the government more than $3 billion.
 He has traveled around the country, promising to dole out development projects the government can hardly afford. In the last year, the cost of construction materials has jumped 30 to 50 percent, and prices of dairy products have increased by more than 15 percent. Many people are asking how this can happen when the price of oil is so high. 
 Without a strong grasp of economics, and an economy that is almost entirely in the hands of the government, Mr. Ahmadinejad has grappled with ways to inject oil revenue into the system without causing inflation to soar. At the same time, the volatile political situation has caused capital flight and limited foreign investment as the needs of the public continue to grow alongside the president's promises.
 In politics, the president by turns ignores and confronts those who have opposed him from the start, whether conservative or liberal, all the while playing to the masses.
 ''Ahmadinejad knows there is a big gap between the intellectual elite and the masses, and he knows how it serves his interest,'' said Emadedin Baghi, director of a prisoners' rights group. ''He is playing to the masses and trying to widen this gap.''
 He has managed to sideline opponents like Mr. Rafsanjani, either through his own initiative or with the back-channel support of Mr. Khamenei, the supreme leader. Mr. Rafsanjani, a midlevel cleric whom Mr. Ahmadinejad defeated in a runoff for the presidency, ''has been undermined, he's not a powerful person anymore,'' said Muhammad Atrianfar, a close ally of Mr. Rafsanjani and publisher of the daily newspaper Shargh. He said Mr. Rafsanjani had tried to get the supreme leader to rein the president in, but was unable to convince him.
 Mr. Rafsanjani is representative of the class of people -- wealthy and influential from the first generation of the revolution -- that the president is trying to displace, said the retired general, Mr. Akhari.

HEADLINE: Back in the Limelight, Gore Insists He's Over Politics 

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27 

 BODY:
''I wanted it, and it was not to be,'' said Al Gore, the former vice president and two-time presidential candidate. ''I am not pursuing it. I have been there, and I have done that.''
 Mr. Gore was on the telephone from New York, taking a break from promoting his book and documentary about global warming, to dismiss -- with a combination of weariness and wariness, but with something approaching finality -- speculation that his rising profile should be interpreted as the first stirrings of another bid for the White House.
''Why should I run for office?'' Mr. Gore asked, the impatience evident in his voice. ''I have no interest in running for office. I have run for office. I have run four national campaigns. I have found other ways to serve my country, and I am enjoying them.''
 After a period in which he had worn out his welcome in some quarters, these have been days of some vindication for Mr. Gore, the Tennessee Democrat who likes to introduce himself as ''the man who used to be the next president of the United States,'' a melancholy reference to his defeat -- a characterization he might be inclined to dispute -- by President Bush in 2000. 
 The warnings of global warming that led former President George Bush to mock Mr. Gore as ''Ozone Man'' in 1992 hardly seem far-fetched in these days of melting ice caps and toasty winters. Mr. Gore's tough condemnation of the war in Iraq, once derided by the White House as evidence of Mr. Gore's extremism, seems positively mainstream today.
 He and his documentary, ''An Inconvenient Truth,'' have been celebrated from Cannes to Hollywood -- ''Even Bill O'Reilly liked it!'' Mr. Gore said -- as he has become the toast of the Democratic left and the blogosphere. 
 With some Democrats recoiling at the prospect of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton as their party's nominee, there is entirely plausible speculation of how Mr. Gore could beat her and capture the Democratic presidential nomination, should he choose to do that.
 Yet if Mr. Gore has any annoyance these days, it is at the suggestion that ''An Inconvenient Truth'' was nothing more than the calculated first stirrings of a campaign for president by a man who has spent most of his life practicing politics and is no stranger to its manipulations and machinations. ''I am not trying to feed that or stimulate that,'' he said.
 When Mr. Gore started promoting the movie, he methodically sought out environmental reporters rather than political reporters, an aide said, to head off the very kind of is-he-running stories that his friends insist offended him, even as they helped draw attention to his movie.
 What Mr. Gore wanted to talk about in a call from New York the other night, as he waited for his daughter to arrive with his grandchildren, was the threat facing Planet Earth. ''My whole objective is to change the mind of the American public so all the presidential candidates in both parties will want to talk about global warming,'' he said.
 But in a feisty and frequently argumentative telephone conversation, Mr. Gore brimmed with disdain at the state of American politics and political journalism, urging his interviewer to quit a career of covering politics to turn to matters of real consequence.
 ''Stop covering politics; cover the climate crisis. It is not too late!'' he said, with a boom of laughter.
 ''Have you read my book?'' he asked a moment later. ''Have you seen the movie?'' Mr. Gore cluck-clucked at the ''not yet but I will'' response.
 To hear Mr. Gore talk about the state of politics and journalism today -- this from a man who has a history in both professions -- it is hard to imagine him ever running for office again. Politics, he said, has become a game of meaningless, mindless battles, conducted by unscrupulous methods and people, designed to transform even the most serious policy debates into sport. 
 His documentary, he said, was trying to break through that.
 ''We need to shift gears in corporate America and in our politics and in our economy and in our culture,'' he said. ''Most of all, political scribes have to take off their cynical lenses through which they view every moral challenge as political spin.''
 ''It's getting a really good response,'' Mr. Gore said of the movie. ''And people see it outside of a partisan context. Now, I know you will not see anything outside of the political context.''
 He laughed.
 Mr. Gore's statement that he had no interest in running in 2008, if not the kind of ironclad assurance politicians and the journalists who cover them tend to demand, came about as close to approaching finality as any he has made. 
 It is not that Mr. Gore does not want to be president, as several of his friends said. When asked whether he thought he would have more influence fighting global warming in the White House or making movies, he responded instantly.
 ''I am under no illusions,'' he said. ''There's no position anywhere equal to the president of the United States in terms of one's ability to influence policy.''
 Yet Mr. Gore has told friends that as much as he wants to be president, his pride, image and legacy -- think the defining first clause in his eventual biography -- could not absorb another race in which he lost again, or really lost. What that means is that Mr. Gore would only run, his associates said, if he was absolutely confident that he could win.
 Mr. Gore is nothing if not a realist, not lured by this interlude in which he is more Democratic hero than goat, his friends said.
 If Mr. Gore, who is 58, wanted to run, he would have no trouble enlisting the resources. Several analysts said Mr. Gore could bide his time before entering the race, confident that the power of the Internet would permit him to raise the kind of money almost instantly that once would have taken months of travel.
 Several of his advisers said that if asked, they would join a Gore campaign for president, and his support from groups like MoveOn.org and with many bloggers is hardly incidental. 
 The praise from the left suggests there is a ready-made base just waiting for him. ''Our members are tremendously excited about him because at a time when politics is dominated by tactical sound-bite politics, here is someone who is a statesman who speaks with intelligence about much bigger issues,'' said Eli Pariser, executive director of MoveOn.org, the liberal advocacy group that has sponsored a series of speeches by Mr. Gore. 
 Mr. Pariser's remarks also suggest that Mr. Gore had managed to shed much of his political baggage from 2000, when he was derided precisely for being a sound-bite candidate, captive of his consultants. 
 In that campaign, Mr. Gore rarely, if ever, talked about global warming, notwithstanding the fact that he had written a book on the subject, ''Earth in the Balance: Ecology and the Human Spirit,'' published in 1992.
 And to Mr. Gore's benefit, the concern among some Democrats about the state of their field is certainly acute. The speculation about a Gore presidential bid was echoed this week by speculation, albeit softer, about the presidential ambitions of another Democrat, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois, who says he has no interest in running this time. 
 Still, the man who used to be the next president of the United States says he wants the world to know that he wants none of that.
 ''That was not to be,'' Mr. Gore said.

HEADLINE: Iran and Iraq to Join to Seal Border Against Insurgents

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, May 27 

 BODY:
Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki of Iran, on the second day of his visit to Iraq, said Saturday that the two countries had agreed to form a joint commission to oversee border issues and that its primary task would be to ''block saboteurs'' crossing the 700-mile border. 
 ''We plan to form a joint commission between Iran and Iraq to control our borders and block the way to saboteurs whose aim is to destabilize the security of the two countries,'' he said in Najaf after talks with Iraq's most powerful Shiite religious leader, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani. 
Mr. Mottaki, whose visit was only the second by an official Iranian government delegation since the downfall of Saddam Hussein, said improved border controls would be part of a wide effort to build close ties between the countries, including $1 billion in Iranian economic assistance to Shiite and Kurdish areas of Iraq.
 American military commanders and diplomats have been focusing on what they say is strong evidence that a covert flow of weapons and money from Iran to Shiite militia groups in Iraq has fueled sectarian violence here. The Americans have urged the new Iraqi government of Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki to tighten security on the weakly patrolled Iran-Iraq border.
 The issue is fraught with political complexity in Iraq, where the Maliki government includes Shiite leaders with links to at least two militias. The militias have been accused of participating in a brutal cycle of sectarian violence that has killed hundreds of people in recent months, in revenge for the relentless attacks on Shiites by Sunni insurgent groups.
 American officials met with Mr. Maliki this week to brief him on what they contend are clandestine Iranian efforts to gain influence in Iraq, and to urge him to take action to restrain that effort as part of his promise to curb all militias in Iraq.
 Mr. Maliki's action on this and other security issues has been curbed, at least to some degree, by jockeying among the ruling parties over the government's top three security posts, left unfilled when his government took office a week ago. 
 A senior United States military official in Baghdad said Saturday that he expected the ministers of interior, defense and national security to be named ''within two or three days.'' 
 Similar predictions were made by Mr. Maliki and American officials last weekend, but candidates brought forward at midweek for two of the posts -- a senior Shiite military officer for the interior post, and a Sunni expatriate in London for the defense ministry -- failed to win approval by all the major groups involved.
 Mr. Maliki, acting as interim interior minister, has appointed another senior official to oversee the defense ministry in an acting capacity. But the delay in completing his government, and particularly in filling the security posts, has been an embarrassing start for a government that came to office under pressure to show it could be more effective than the departing government of the former prime minister, Ibrahim al-Jaafari, widely seen as a failure.
 Top American officials have said that Mr. Maliki has a matter of weeks, months at most, to show that he can take control. These officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of their relations with Iraqi leaders, have said that another failure on the scale of Mr. Jaafari's could fundamentally undermine the American undertaking here, and with it the hope of progressing over 18 months or so to orderly American troop reductions.
 In a statement released Saturday night, the American military said two marines were missing after their AH-1 Super Cobra attack helicopter crashed during a maintenance flight in Anbar Province, a desert region where Sunni Arab insurgents have mounted some of their fiercest challenges to American troops. The statement said that the crash ''does not appear to be the result of enemy action'' and that search and rescue efforts were under way.
 A new wave of violence across Iraq in the 24 hours until Saturday evening killed at least 15 people, according to police reports. In Baghdad, a bomb in a parked car exploded near a busy police station on Saturday morning, killing four civilians. There were at least four attacks on police patrols, with an officer killed and at least 13 wounded by a roadside bombing and a series of drive-by shootings. On Friday night, a shooting spree broke out when a referee disallowed a goal during a soccer game in the Risafa neighborhood, leaving two men dead.
 Baquba had at least three attacks on police targets on Saturday, including an ambush that killed the city's deputy police chief and four other officers. Two other policemen, one a general, died in separate attacks.
 The border issue is just one of the challenges facing the Maliki government and American forces here. The top American commander in Iraq, Gen. George W. Casey Jr., traveled by helicopter this week to two points along the Iranian border northeast of Baghdad to assess the effectiveness of Iraqi border police posts along the frontier, and was told by Iraqi border commanders that they had only a fraction of the manpower, vehicles and fuel they needed to control cross-border smuggling and infiltration.
 The Americans say they believe that men, weapons and money are reaching at least two Shiite militia groups: the Badr Organization that is controlled by the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq, a powerful body in the Maliki government; and the Mahdi Army, which is loyal to the volatile Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr, who has loyalists in the new government even as he is declaring his hostility to the American military presence here.
 The Americans believe that some of the weapons and ammunition reaching Baghdad come across the Diyala Province border east and north of Baghdad and are taken to brick kilns in the vicinity of the Diyala capital of Baquba before being shipped 50 miles southwest into Baghdad hidden among truckloads of bricks.

HEADLINE: Second-Generation Renovation

BYLINE: By ROBERT STRAUSS

DATELINE: MONTCLAIR 

 BODY:
THE mention of Rees Jones in Barbara Bush's autobiography tells one part of the story. It is a brief note in ''Barbara Bush: A Memoir,'' about her and former President George H. W. Bush's 50th anniversary weekend in Sea Island, Ga., where they had spent their honeymoon. Mr. Jones got to play in a fivesome that included Bill Jones, the chief executive of Sea Island, the professional golfer Davis Love III, former Attorney General Griffin B. Bell and Mr. Bush.
 ''One time Mr. Bush hit a ball in some swampy area and started to search for it,'' said the 64-year-old Mr. Jones, who was invited along because he had designed the course. ''I told him he didn't have to do that, that we would give him a good lie.''
 ''But he said it had the Presidential seal on it, and since he was no longer President, he was running out of those balls,'' Mr. Jones said with his signature hearty laugh. 
 Yet there is the other part of the story, the one best told by a knitted pillow in Mr. Jones's office here with the words ''Wells College'' embroidered on it. His mother attended Wells, in Aurora, N.Y., after graduating from Montclair High School as the class valedictorian. Mr. Jones also grew up in Montclair, and went on to Yale. And his daughters, Alden and Amy, carried on the tradition by attending Montclair (Alden went on to Brown, and Amy to Duke).
 So as comfortable as Mr. Jones is mingling with the rich and famous, he is also at home with his tight-knit family. In fact, he went into his father's business.
 It should be noted here that his father was Robert Trent Jones Sr., one of the premier golf course architects of his day, who in the late 1940's teamed up with the premier golfer of the first half of the 20th century, Bobby Jones (no relation), to build the Peachtree Golf Club course in Atlanta, one of the first of the great long, treacherous courses that started the post-World War II golf boom. 
 ''But even then, there was just not much money in golf course design, so we didn't have many vacations,'' Mr. Jones said. ''The vacations were mostly where dad was doing courses. So my brother and I went along. I guess that's how we got where we did.''
 Rees's older brother, Robert Trent Jones Jr., also designs courses at his company in Palo Alto, Calif., including the Princeville Course in Kauai, Hawaii, often cited on lists of the Top 100 courses in the world.
 But it is Rees Jones who has taken on his late father's mantle as the ''Open Doctor,'' the go-to guy for elite golf clubs hoping to serve as host of prestigious tournaments like the United States Open or the P.G.A. Championship. 
 Robert Trent Jones Sr., who died in 2000 at age 93, is often credited with starting the redesign craze, at Oakland Hills' South course in Bloomfield Hills, Mich., just before the United States Open there in 1951. His success won him commissions to work on several courses, including the most revered 18 holes in America, Augusta National, where the Masters is played each spring.
 So far, Rees Jones has redesigned seven United States Open courses, five P.G.A. Championship courses and three Ryder Cup courses. Putting on a major tournament is an enormous coup for a club; it can be a moneymaker, a publicity bonanza and most of all a source of prestige for years to come.
 ''Some design companies want 30, 40, 50 jobs at a time,'' Mr. Jones said. ''I don't want too many jobs, just good ones. Someone once told me that the key to success in this business is when you go back to the course, they are all happy to see you.''
 Generally, Mr. Jones said, a club where a major tournament has been played wants to rip up at least part of the course afterward to attract future matches, figuring that altering some holes will make the course look ''new'' and innovative. 
 For instance, Mr. Jones was asked to redesign the course at Oakland Hills -- where the 1996 United States Open was held -- for the 2008 P.G.A. Championship. And Torrey Pines, a municipal course in San Diego that has been the site of a PGA Tour tournament since 1968, brought in Mr. Jones to redesign the course in 2001. Soon afterward, it was awarded the 2008 United States Open. 
 Mr. Jones, who shoots in the high 70's and low 80's, says he thinks he has been successful, in part, because he is a good enough golfer to see things from everyone's eyes. 
 ''I'm not a really great player who doesn't really understand how the average golfer plays, but I am not a real average golfer who doesn't understand the pros,'' he said. ''My skills enable me to understand most every caliber of player.''
 ''I hope people enjoy the game of golf on my golf courses,'' he added. ''It is an escape. It is not supposed to be harder than life itself. People find my courses with continuing interest. They don't feel they are a death march. They look forward to the next hole rather than looking forward to the end of the round.''
 Mr. Jones said his mother, Ione Davis Jones, who died in 1987, did not mind her children taking up her husband's profession, as long as they got a good education first.
 Robert Trent Jones Jr. said that his brother always had confidence. ''Rees would look in the mirror and study himself and contemplate who he was,'' he said.
 At Yale, Rees Jones studied architecture. Then he took graduate courses at the Harvard School of Design. 
 ''But basically, I learned from my father,'' he said. ''It's a craft. It's not a profession. You learn by doing and by understanding the game.''
 The Jones brothers drove tractors, learned irrigation and did just about everything when they worked for their father. Then, in 1974, Rees Jones decided to go out on his own. It was both a good and a bad time to do so.
 ''There was the oil embargo, high interest rates and a recession,'' he said. ''But it was a good time to establish myself. People were waiting for projects to start, but they weren't really into effect. I did a lot of remodeling jobs, and then all of a sudden the economy turned around, and I did some projects -- Hilton Head, Pinehurst No. 7 -- which helped catapult my career.''
 A good enough golfer to play on the varsity at Yale, he encouraged his daughters to play when they were young. The other family passion is college basketball. Mr. Jones, a lanky 6-footer, played basketball at Montclair High, though not in college. 
 His wife of 38 years, Susan, went to the University of North Carolina, a college basketball power, so the family attends several games a year. (The couple met while skiing in Vermont -- ''It was near a golf course, but there was snow on it,'' he said.) Amy went to Duke, her father said, largely because she wanted to attend a college that offered good basketball as well as strong academics. She is now a social worker in New York City, and her sister, Alden, is a writer in Boston.
 Today, Rees Jones Inc. employs about three dozen workers, including several designers, an administrative staff and a construction crew. Though some course designers hire freelance construction crews, Mr. Jones says he prefers having his own because he likes to use experienced people who know how he operates.
 ''From paper to ground is not easy, especially when it is creative and artistic and flowing,'' he said. ''It is artistry that you play on. It's not a highway interchange.''
 Most new courses today are part of exclusive real estate developments or casinos. Mr. Jones has designed two courses at the Foxwoods casino resort in Connecticut and real-estate-driven courses in Hawaii and on Nantucket.
 These days, he said, courses are more in tune with the environment than they were a generation ago. Without government restrictions like wetlands protection, developers would regularly put courses in swamps and other environmentally sensitive areas. Now, he said, the courses are environmentally and aesthetically superior.
 ''In Nantucket, they wanted us to save some grasslands,'' Mr. Jones said. ''We're now working to enhance the land, instead of ruin it. Golf is now, truly, a beautiful walk in the park.''

HEADLINE: Cutting Sony, a Corporate Octopus, Back to a Rational Size

BYLINE: By MARTIN FACKLER

DATELINE: WAKO, Japan 

 BODY:
When Kumiko Ishioka bought car insurance last year, she chose the company that offered the cheapest rate. It also helped that the company bore the same brand name as that on her life insurance policy, her favorite skin lotion and her television set -- Sony.
 ''Sony is definitely a name you can trust,'' Ms. Ishioka, 38, the owner of a clothing boutique in this Tokyo suburb, said. ''But it's not really an electronics company anymore.
In the United States, Sony is known as an aggressive electronics giant that expanded into music and Hollywood films, with mixed results. But at home in Japan, Sony is large and diffuse, a sprawling conglomerate that sells products as diverse as flashlight batteries, online banking services -- even foie gras.
 This presents a problem. Sony has expanded into so many business areas in Japan and abroad that it has blurred its original identity as an engineering innovator. Analysts say this murkier image threatens one of the company's most profitable assets: the so-called Sony premium, the higher prices long commanded by its electronics products, which still account for 64 percent of revenue, excluding sales between Sony divisions. 
 Restoring this premium, they say, is one of the most pressing challenges facing Sony's chief executive, Sir Howard Stringer, who took over nearly a year ago, as he tries to reinvigorate the company after years of lackluster products and disappointing profits. While earnings have begun recovering, analysts say, the premium is still shrinking.
 Sony remains one of the world's best-known brands. But even in the United States, analysts say, it is as likely to be associated with the movie ''The Da Vinci Code'' as with portable music devices, a product category Sony invented in 1979 with the Walkman cassette player but which the Apple iPod now dominates.
 ''What is Sony?'' asked Hitoshi Kuriyama, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. ''We don't even know anymore. Consumers used to pay more because the brand meant something special.''
 While Sony has lost the most ground in Japan, analysts say the Sony premium has also shrunk in the United States, where the company has had to price newer products like high-definition television sets close to the level of rivals like Sharp, Panasonic and Samsung. 
 ''Sony has to trim its premium,'' said Paul O'Donovan of the market research company Gartner. ''The brand equity, although still high, is clearly on the decline in consumers' minds.''
 Sir Howard calls restoring Sony's image a priority, to prevent the problems in Japan from spreading overseas.
 He has pledged to refocus the company on electronics, and on creating the sort of ''champion products'' that made Sony famous in the first place. In February, he announced plans to sell several noncore businesses based in Japan, including a cosmetics maker, a mail-order shopping company called the Sony Family Club and a chain of Parisian restaurants.
 While Sir Howard has made progress, as was demonstrated in a recent upturn in earnings, analysts say he has a long way to go.
 ''We need to rebuild the brand seriously,'' he said in an interview, ''in terms of energy and perception around the world.''
 Globally, the company has about 1,000 subsidiaries and affiliates, of which about a third are unrelated to its core electronics business. While many are in Japan, they include the likes of the Sony Metreon shopping mall in San Francisco.
 In fact, the Sony group's most profitable line of business last year was not electronics or entertainment, but finance. The company has three financial units in Japan, whose low fees have made them popular: Sony Life Insurance; Sony Assurance, a nonlife insurer whose coverage includes auto policies; and Sony Bank, an online lender. These subsidiaries earned $1.7 billion in the fiscal year ended in March, though losses in electronics dragged Sony's overall profit down to $1.1 billion.
 Sony's success as a cut-rate financial company seems to run counter to its desire to remain a top-end brand in electronics, analysts say. And nowhere is the loss of the Sony premium more apparent than in Japan, where it took in 20 percent of its electronics-related revenue last year.
 Visit electronics stores in Tokyo, and Sony's new Bravia line of liquid-crystal-display television sits prominently in front, next to the rival Sharp and Panasonic. This is the work of the new chief executive of Sony's electronics division, Ryoji Chubachi, who regularly visits large retailers to offer incentives for making Sony products more visible -- something his predecessors never deigned to do.
 More important, Bravia TV's now cost about the same as rival sets, the result of price-cutting last fall as Sony tried to regain its position as the world's top-selling TV maker. It succeeded, replacing Sharp last quarter, according to an American market data company, Display Research. But this success came at the cost of Sony's ability to charge more than its competitors.
 ''The Sony premium keeps getting smaller,'' said Hiroshi Takada, an analyst in the Tokyo office of J. P. Morgan. ''The top end of the TV market is much more crowded now.''
 Sony's slipping status is not lost on consumers here. ''Buying a Sony TV used to be like buying a Mercedes-Benz,'' said Yoshihiro Ueda, 42, a bank employee shopping for liquid-crystal-display television sets at a discount retailer in central Tokyo. ''It's still a good name, but Sony doesn't stand out anymore.'' Mr. Ueda said he was buying a Sharp TV instead. 
 This hazier image is also showing up in recent consumer surveys. Last month, BP Nikkei Consulting in Tokyo released a survey showing that Sony dropped to Japan's eighth-most admired brand, from the top position last year. The number of consumers saying that Sony showed ''conspicuous individuality'' dropped to about 25 percent, from about 40 percent the year before, BP Nikkei said.
 For a generation of consumers in Japan and the United States, Sony was the company that transformed personal entertainment with its Trinitron color television sets, Walkman portable music players and compact disc players.
 But Sony also showed early ambitions to reach beyond electronics and become a global conglomerate, as many companies aspired to do in the decades after World War II. Akio Morita, the company's co-founder, envisioned offering consumers not just television sets and stereos, but movies and songs to play on them and also the bank credit with which to buy them.
 Sony made its first foray into finance, establishing a life insurance unit in 1979. The casualty insurer and bank were established in 1999 and 2001 respectively under Nobuyuki Idei, then chief executive, who shared Mr. Morita's penchant for empire-building. 
 It was also under Mr. Morita that Sony started a French restaurant chain in 1966, licensing the Maxim's de Paris name. He later led Sony into entertainment, acquiring record labels and then Columbia Pictures in 1989. Seen at the time as a symbol of Japan's rising economic might, the Columbia takeover ended up costing Sony billions as the Japanese struggled to understand Hollywood's culture.
 Since he took Sony's helm last June, Sir Howard has promised to increase cooperation between the electronics and entertainment arms. He has also tried to prune the sprawling electronics business by shedding 600 of Sony's 3,000 product models, including the Qualia line of luxury electronics and Aibo the robot dog.
 ''Sony was just too diversified,'' said Iwao Nakatani, dean of Tama University in Tokyo, who was a member of Sony's board until last year. ''Howard Stringer is doing what his predecessors were unable to do.''
 So far, Sir Howard has defied expectations that he would sell larger noncore businesses, particularly the three big finance units. Sony has flirted with selling parts of its financial units before, including talks with several American and European financial companies four years ago about selling a stake in Sony Life, the company said.
 Many analysts and even Sony employees say Sir Howard could spin the finance units off as early as next year. One possibility, according to analysts, is to take them public while holding on to a controlling stake, a sale that could earn Sony billions of dollars.
 But many Japanese are sad to see some Sony products go. Entire Web sites have sprung up on which owners of Aibo robot dogs fume about the product's demise.
 Ms. Ishioka, the boutique owner, said she hoped nothing happened to the line of skin lotions and treatments bearing the Sony name and sold by Sony's cosmetics maker, B& C Laboratories. She said she first started using the products after hearing that Crown Princess Masako used Sony skin care products before her wedding in 1993. Ms. Ishioka said she also visited Sony's cosmetic outlets for beauty massages, a service popularly known here as the Sony Esthe.
 ''I want my Sony Esthe as much as my Sony TV,'' she said.

 BODY:

DAY OF REST -- All stock markets, government offices and many businesses are closed today in observance of Memorial Day.

BEFORE THE DEAL IS DONE -- The grocery giant Albertson's will release its last quarterly earnings before it is acquired by Supervalu, a deal that is expected to close in June. Like other grocery chains, Albertson's has been hurt by competition from Wal-Mart. (Tuesday.) 


EXPECTING LOSSES -- Vodafone, a British company that jointly owns Verizon Wireless with Verizon, will state its yearly earnings. Analysts expect Vodafone to report losses in the billions, attributed in part to asset write-downs. (Tuesday.)

WORD FOR WORD -- The Federal Reserve will release the minutes of its May meeting, where, as expected, the central bank decided to raise interest rates for a 16th consecutive time. (Wednesday.)

SALES WATCH -- Automakers are expected to release sales figures for May. The data should reveal whether gas prices are affecting the kind of vehicles being sold. The industry will also take note if Toyota outsells DaimlerChrysler in the United States for a second consecutive month. (Thursday).

PLACATING -- H.J. Heinz will announce its growth strategy, hoping to satisfy angry shareholders and the leveraged buyout specialist Nelson Peltz. Presumably the company will propose something less drastic than the cost-cutting that Mr. Peltz is demanding. (Thursday).

PAIN INTO GAIN -- Quarterly earnings numbers are expected from Jackson Hewitt Tax Service. The company may have benefited from the recent embarrassments and lawsuits that have plagued H&R Block. (Thursday.)

ECONOMIC INDICATORS -- Several barometers will be released, including the Chicago purchasing managers report for May (Wednesday); productivity for the first quarter, the Institute of Supply Management manufacturing index for May and construction spending for April. (Thursday.)

JOBS -- The main economic indicator of the week, the jobless report for May, will be released. An addition of 175,000 jobs is expected. About 138,000 jobs were added in April. (Friday.)

HEADLINE: The Interest Must Be Paid

 BODY:
Recent stock market turmoil has been a plus for United States Treasury securities. Over the last couple of weeks, investor demand for safety has generally pushed up the price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury bond, making it cheaper for the government to borrow. But there is still plenty of reason to worry about the United States' borrowing binge. 
 By definition, federal borrowing eventually results in a transfer of income from American taxpayers, whose taxes go to pay the interest on the debt, to the investors who hold the Treasury bonds. As long as the bonds are owned by Americans, the transfer is simply from one group of citizens to another. Bond holders may get richer, while taxpayers who don't own bonds get poorer, which could add to troubling disparities in personal wealth. But shuffling the income between the two groups doesn't reduce America's overall wealth.
Today, however, 43 percent of the United States' publicly held debt of $4.8 trillion is held abroad, mainly by central banks in Japan, China and Britain and by offshore hedge funds. That's up from a 30 percent share in 2001, an extraordinary increase. Indeed, during the Bush years, 73 percent of new government borrowing has been from abroad. 
 Paying the interest on the foreign-owned portion of the debt will be a burden on future Americans, draining their wallets and siphoning off the nation's wealth. 
 Reliance on foreign lenders poses current dangers, as well. A shift in investor sentiment, away from dollar-based investments and into other countries' assets, could be very destabilizing, forcing a drop in the dollar, higher interest rates and higher prices. Such shifts can be sudden, as in the Asian financial crisis in 1998. 
 Of course, no one knows the future. But we can size up our present reality: America is living beyond its means, and foreigners are increasingly supporting the excess -- in exchange for a government guarantee that a chunk of America's future collective income will benefit them, not the Americans who earn it.

 BODY:
After the Senate's recent vote to make English the ''national language'' of the United States, an avalanche of accusations accumulated, suggesting much illiberal villainy. The Senate's enshrinement of English in the immigration bill it approved last week was cautious: the proposed law says the government must '' preserve and enhance the role of English,'' but it leaves intact federal laws requiring multilingual materials and services. Yet some critics immediately attacked it as xenophobic, even racist. 
 But perhaps, to put things in a broader perspective, it may help to step outside the United States' debates about English and look at a situation that is its precise opposite. A few months ago officials from the European Union scrutinized Germany's compliance with the 1992 European Charter for Regional and Minority Languages, a counterweight to the very idea of official languages. It stresses what it calls ''the value of interculturalism and multilingualism.'' It demands that treaty participants ''promote regional or minority languages,'' encourage their use, create political links among their speakers, guarantee access to them in criminal and civil proceedings, and encourage their presence in television and radio. Procedures were established for monitoring compliance with this project. 
 In March a European Union ''committee of experts,'' as they are officially called, issued a 168-page report (available at www.coe.int/t/e/legal--affairs) after examining Germany's compliance. The gist of it is that in Germany ''more determined measures are needed to encourage the use of regional or minority languages in economic and social life.'' Germany is, for example, asked to ''remedy the existing shortage of Lower Sorbian-speaking teachers,'' to ''develop and implement the educational model for North Frisian proposed by the North Frisian speakers'' and ''reverse the decline in study and research opportunities for Low German, Sater Frisian and Lower Sorbian.'' Germany's response in a 50-page appendix did little to mitigate the righteous sentiments of the final verdict.
 This is a bizarre situation: treating languages as possessing inalienable rights and entitlements, meriting artificial life-support seemingly in inverse proportion to their importance. The charter justifies this explicit promotion of these languages as a means of preserving cultural legacy but also intends it to be a form of recompense, asserting that these minority languages are victims of ''unjustified distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference'' once intended to ''discourage or endanger'' them. 
 On a larger scale, this view was elaborated upon in 1996 in a Universal Declaration of Linguistic Rights, in which the International PEN club and other organizations, supported by Unesco, affirmed principles like ''Everyone has the right to carry out all activities in the public sphere in his/her language.'' 
 There are, to be sure, reasons for the accusatory tone of these reports. Minority languages suffered grievous indignities as nation-states came into being. In France, for example, where French has been the official state language since 1539, there were periods when even other native languages, like Breton, were barred from the classroom and treated as obstacles to the nation's unity. 
 The French language is so central to the idea of France that its status is affirmed in its constitution, which is one reason France signed the European Union minority-language charter but never ratified it. Other nations did the same, selecting remedies they could comfortably endorse. (Twenty nations have ratified the charter; 12 others have signed without ratification.) They know what is at stake. So does the European Union: it seeks to weaken the idea of the nation-state. 
 But many of these debates are only incidentally about immigration. Low German is not being championed to support immigrant rights; even the challenges posed by Europe's radical Islamic immigrants have little to do with language. Instead, as the European Union language charter shows, linguistic issues grow out of a perception of some social and historical wrong and skepticism about the power of the nation-state. 
 To a certain extent the issues are very different here, where claims have been made not in the name of linguistic rights but identity rights. The group speaking the minority language feels subject to ''unjustified distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference.'' Here too, though, this sense of a wronged past has helped spur linguistic change, including bilingual education (which has proved to be far from the promised panacea). There has also been pressure to expand language education here, not to right historical wrongs, but because the United States isn't considered multilingual enough. 
 The challenge to the state has also been different here. In the United States national identity has only accidentally been tied to the dominance of English. Slavery and the American Indian past aside, this is a nation of immigrants. While immigration did spur waves of resentment and opposition, the United States offers a profound example of successful integration of immigrant populations, aided by the traditional immigrant desire to adopt the dominant language rather than to insist on alternatives. It is only in the last 30 years, with the onset of identity politics, that there were efforts to promote an opposing view.
 But it is ideology, not immigration, that is the deciding issue. In March a poll by Zogby International of 1,007 Americans found that the establishment of English as the ''official language'' has widespread support among diverse groups, including 71 percent of Hispanics and 82 percent of Democrats. Another Zogby poll, in 2005, found more than 80 percent of first- and second-generation Americans supporting the idea. 
 So the effort is not a matter of xenophobia. It is an attempt to take a position in the vexing debate over the future of the nation-state: What are the forces that hold it together, and what are the forces that threaten to split it apart? What sacrifices are asked for the sake of unity? And what sacrifices should not be asked for that purpose? These are the same issues that are causing citizenship tests to be scrutinized throughout the Western world. The coherence of the state can no longer be taken for granted when divisions within it are so enthusiastically endorsed; the European Union language charter reflects a problem, not a solution. 
 But establishment of a national language doesn't provide the solution either. A shared language doesn't promise unity any more than multiple languages promise disunity. France, with perhaps the longest and most established national language, is facing some of the most serious multicultural schisms. The United States has had one of the world's most successful experiences with immigration without having had a national language. Many states have more than one official language without suffering ill effects; others boast multiple languages that reflect persistent schisms, as in Cyprus (between Turkish and Greek), and Sri Lanka (between Tamil and Sinhala). 
 The outrage over the Senate vote is out of proportion. Meanwhile important discussions about the nation-state, and how it might evolve in the midst of diversity, are barely heard in the din, almost drowned out by the shouting between the nation-state and Babel's growing tower. 

Connections, a critic's perspective on arts and ideas, appears every other Monday.

HEADLINE: Pay Bills With a Click? More Americans Are Doing It and Banks Are Loving It 

BYLINE: By Bob Tedeschi

 BODY:
FROM the annals of Online Economics 101 comes this shocker: free is good, especially when it comes to paying bills.
 Big billers like Verizon Wireless and ConEd learned this bit of wisdom years ago, when they offered customers the ability to pay bills free online. But most banks have come to the same realization only in the last 18 months.
The result has been a boom in the number of bills viewed and paid online. According to a recent poll by Harris Interactive, a research firm, the gap between the number of bills paid by check and the number paid online has closed significantly in the past year. More than 37 percent of bills are paid by check; 35 percent are paid online. The remaining 28 percent are paid with cash, debit cards or other payment methods. 
 Given that trend, Web payments could surpass checks over the next year. (Last year, 46 percent of bills were paid by check, and 25 percent online.) 
 Banks are hoping to accelerate the move by marketing online services far more aggressively. Television campaigns, radio spots and, of course, online advertisements from the Bank of America and Wells Fargo, among others, now promote the benefits of such services, where in years past banks advertised other features like online statements and account balances.
 The caveat with these numbers is that the Harris poll was commissioned by CheckFree, which helps banks and billers build online bill presentment and payment services. But analysts said the data mirrored other research showing the growing popularity of the service. 
 ''The days when people see the U.S. mail as a safe and rational place to do our bills are numbered,'' said James Van Dyke, president of Javelin Strategy and Research, a consultancy based in Pleasanton, Calif.
 According to Javelin, roughly half of all households with Internet access have paid bills at a biller's Web site; about 40 percent have paid bills through a bank or credit union site in the previous month. Analysts say consumers still greatly prefer to pay bills at the Web sites of their financial institutions, not just because customers trust banks and credit unions with their finances, but also because these Web sites can display and process multiple bills at once.
 Banks generally agreed with that logic in the past, but they were not willing to pay the fees charged by CheckFree, Metavante and other technology companies who processed electronic payments and bills on their behalf, and their customers were not willing to cough up $6 a month to subsidize the effort, either. A consortium of banks including Wells Fargo and Wachovia tried building their own technology several years ago. In 2002 Metavante bought the company, called Spectrum, that the consortium created. 
 Since then, technology vendors have cut fees by 20 percent to 30 percent and banks have recognized the considerable leverage of online bill payment services, thereby making them more willing to absorb those fees.
 Customers who pay bills online ''have increased loyalty to the banks,'' according to Greg Cardinali, Wachovia's vice president of product management for online services. Mr. Cardinali would not say how much more money these customers keep with Wachovia, but said, ''we have a deeper share of their wallet.''
 According to Catherine Graeber, an analyst with Forrester Research, a technology consultancy, a bank's online bill payers are substantially more likely than their check-writing counterparts to rely on the bank for credit cards and other financial services, and they also call the bank less frequently, so they are less costly to serve. ''Online bill pay does have a halo effect,'' Ms. Graeber said.
 Banks still have some obstacles to overcome, though, before that halo illuminates the full breadth of their customer base. Forty-one percent of United States households with Internet access now pay their bills online -- up from 31 percent in 2004, when most banks still charged for the services. Ms. Graeber predicted that it would take four more years to top the 50 percent mark.
 Why would the rate of growth slow down? Ms. Graeber said part of the problem was that online bill payment was tied to online tenure: the more online experience someone has, the more willing they are to consider the service. As a result, many Internet users who have had access for only a few years may not be ready to move into more sophisticated Internet transactions like bill payment for some time. 
 In the meantime, the technology has steadily improved, making it simpler to understand and use. Bank of America, which was the first to offer a free service, in 2002, and which claims to have the most online bill payers of any bank, with 7.7 million, has tweaked its system regularly in recent years. 
 According to Sanjay Gupta, Bank of America's e-commerce executive, users now typically enter nothing more than the company name and account number to sent payments, whereas in years past they were required to enter the company's full address, among other things.
 Earlier this year, Bank of America also changed its system so the customer's money remains in his account until the biller has deposited the payment. In years past, the customers' checking account was immediately debited.
 Other banks are also developing systems where customers can pay bills at the last minute and have the biller paid instantly. Online Resources, an online bill payment and presentment company serving mostly local and regional banks like New York Community Bank and Ohio Savings Bank, will probably offer such a feature to its clients early next year, according to Matthew P. Lawlor, the chief executive.
 Indeed, just as the banks have profited from the growth in online bill payment, so too have the vendors that serve them. Online Resources, which acquired the online payments company Princeton eCom for $180 million earlier this month, posted revenue of more than $60 million last year, up from $42 million in 2004. CheckFree, meanwhile, posted $758 million in sales in fiscal 2005, an increase of 25 percent over fiscal 2004. 
 Matthew Lewis, CheckFree's executive vice president, said the company had created new sources of revenue over the past year, crunching data for banks and helping them identify potentially fraudulent transactions. But he said CheckFree's core mission remained focused on consumers. 
 ''Mainstream America is increasingly finding ways the Web can really improve their lives,'' Mr. Lewis said. ''We want to make this more part of the way Americans live their lives.''

HEADLINE: Reality TV, Ripening In the Heat Of Summer 

BYLINE: By BILL CARTER

 BODY:
Memorial Day means the unofficial start of summer (white shoes permitted). But it also means the official start of another season: reality television season.
 The kickoff was last Thursday, when Fox presented the first reality show of the summer, ''So You Think You Can Dance,'' a talent competition for hoofers. That series jump-started the summer reality show monsoon one week early in a successful effort to grab some of the huge audience glued to the latest ''American Idol'' lollapalooza.
Reality shows play summer after summer because they provide two advantages: higher ratings than repeats and lower costs than new scripted shows. But the real standard for summer reality shows, of course, is making it into the regular season, and here their record is impressive. 
 Except for the summer of 2004, the four big networks have managed to find at least one reality show every summer since 1999 that could transfer to the more economically meaningful regular season. Some of those have been among the biggest discoveries of recent vintage, including ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' on ABC in 1999, ''Survivor'' on CBS in 2000, and the Godzilla of the genre, ''American Idol'' on Fox in 2002. 
 ''We're all looking for the next megahit,'' said Craig Plestis, the senior vice president in charge of reality programming at NBC, which introduced ''Fear Factor'' during the summer of 2001. ''I just don't want a megahit on the competition again.''
 ABC had the closest show of that stature last summer with ''Dancing With the Stars,'' which moved to the regular season and maintained strong ratings. That move turned out to be a masterstroke for Andrea Wong, ABC's top reality programming executive, who was alone in believing that a show about ballroom dancing could be a smash.
 Summer is also the season where the networks experiment with unconventional ideas. Perhaps for that reason, the brief history of the summer reality show is dense with offerings that seemed too strange in concept, too narrow in appeal or plain goofy in execution. ''It's the time when you can take some quirky shots with shows,'' said Kelly Kahl, the chief scheduling executive for CBS. 
 He might have been speaking of ''Tuesday Night Book Club,'' certainly CBS's most offbeat idea for a reality show since ''Big Brother.'' In this one, a group of real-life women from Scottsdale, Ariz. -- all members of the same book club -- let down their hair on all kinds of intimate topics, from marital problems to extramarital affairs. They even hold a Botox party. Mr. Kahl described it as ''something like a real-life 'Desperate Housewives.' ''
 CBS's book club idea borrows from the segment of the reality genre that turns on real-life relationships, lately exemplified by ''Laguna Beach'' on MTV. ABC has a couple of shows along the same lines. ''How to Get the Guy'' follows four single women on a search for romance in San Francisco. Another series, ''One Ocean View,'' will chronicle the adventures of single New Yorkers who leave the city each weekend for a house at the shore.
 At NBC, which, Mr. Plestis acknowledged, has an aching need for a hit, the biggest summer hope is ''America's Got Talent,'' not so much for its conventional premise (it is basically another talent show) as for who is behind it. The show is the latest brainstorm of Simon Cowell of ''American Idol,'' except this one celebrates talents that go far beyond singing.
 That's the offbeat angle. Mr. Plestis said the show would include conventional performers, like bands and comedians, but also acts like ''Johnny Fast Fingers,'' who plays songs on his hands, and ''a pirate act that involves a horse.'' The winner will get $1 million.
 NBC is so confident of ''America's Got Talent'' -- or perhaps in Mr. Cowell -- that it has already announced that the show will return in January on Sunday nights. Mr. Plestis, noting that Regis Philbin has signed on as host, said NBC simply believes the show ''has a certain magic to it.''
 Of course if ''America's Got Talent'' falters, NBC's commitment to bring the show back will evaporate. In that case the network hopes its other new entry, a show called ''Treasure Hunters,'' breaks through. This reality series will send teams of three people around the world, picking up clues to a central mystery. If it does succeed, it will most likely be because of the overt connection NBC is making between the show and a certain popular book.
 ''It's 'The Da Vinci Code' more than anything else,'' Mr. Plestis said of the marketing approach.
 NBC's other summer reality series is ''Last Comic Standing,'' which had been evolving into a summer staple until the network tried to move it into the regular season. It flopped. Now it is back in the summer.
 CBS has always tempered its expectations for ''Big Brother,'' which has remained purely a summer success. According to Mr. Kahl, ''it is very profitable.''
 After finding a breakout hit, making money off summer shows is the second-biggest goal. Reality series still have lower costs than scripted shows, though they no longer qualify as dirt-cheap programming. Most reality series approach a production cost of $1 million an hour, about a third less than a scripted hour.
 Networks must shelve summer repeats of scripted series to make room for the reality shows. Since the repeats of scripted shows do not incur additional costs, reality shows that replace them need to generate enough advertising revenue to cover their price tag. 
 The added benefit of solid summer reality shows is that they increase a network's audience. That allows a network to promote its coming fall shows to more people. CBS, for example, welcomes the steady ratings for the three plays a week of ''Big Brother'' even though they often displace a series that would repeat well.
 The network was also pleased last summer with ''Rock Star,'' a new addition from the ''Survivor'' producer, Mark Burnett. Although that show did not explode into a hit that could jump to the regular season, it did pull in younger viewers whom CBS does not usually attract. 
 Mr. Burnett is bringing ''Rock Star'' back this summer, which holds a weekly audition for a lead singer in a new band made up of artists from big acts like Motley Crue (Tommy Lee) and Metallica (Jason Newsted). 
 That series and ''America's Got Talent'' fit into an expanding reality category, the talent show. ABC has two summer talent series. One is ''The One: Making a Music Star,'' containing most of the familiar elements of ''Idol'' except that the contestants will also live together (an element that ''Rock Star'' added last year). 
 The other ABC talent series is ''Masters and Champions,'' which sets up weird contests (like interpretive pizza tossing) among professional stunt people.
 The fifth ABC summer series falls into a category that the network pioneered, principally with ''Extreme Makeover: Home Edition'' -- the ''feel-good show.'' In ''Buy It Now,'' needy families will chase a dream by putting some prized heirloom up for auction on eBay. Others in their extended family or community will also put up valuable possessions, and if enough money is raised on the Web auction, the needy family's dream will come true. 
 What genres are left? Cooking? That will be taken care of in a second summer of Fox's ''Hell's Kitchen,'' with Gordon Ramsay abusing would-be chefs. Game show? CBS has a prime entry, ''The Game Show Marathon,'' in which celebrities will compete in a series of familiar formats, like ''Let's Make a Deal'' and ''Beat the Clock.''
 ''Looks like a busy summer,'' Mr. Plestis said.

HEADLINE: The Troops Have Moved On

BYLINE: By Owen West. 
Owen West, a reserve Marine major who served in Iraq, is the founder of Vets for Freedom.

 BODY:
''NEITHER party expected for the war the magnitude or the duration which it has already attained. Neither anticipated that the cause of the conflict might cease with or even before the conflict itself should cease.'' 
 So said Abraham Lincoln in his second inaugural address, describing a war that put 11 percent of our citizens in uniform and had by that point killed nearly one of out every seven soldiers. That his words are relevant again now is a troubling indicator of our national endurance.
We are at the outset of a long war, and not just in Iraq. Yet it is being led politically by the short-sighted, from both sides of the aisle. The deterioration of American support for the mission in Iraq is indicative not so much of our military conduct there, where real gains are coming slowly but steadily, but of chaotic leadership. 
 Somehow Operation Iraqi Freedom, not a large war by America's historical standards, has blossomed into a crisis of expectations that threatens our ability to react to future threats with a fist instead of five fingers. Instead of rallying we are squabbling, even as the slow fuse burns. 
 One party is overly sanguine, unwilling to acknowledge its errors. The other is overly maudlin, unable to forgive the same. The Bush administration seeks to insulate the public from the reality of war, placing its burden on the few. The press has tried to fill that gap by exposing the raw brutality of the insurgency; but it has often done so without context, leaving a clear implication that we can never win.
 In the past, the American public could turn to its sons for martial perspective. Soldiers have historically been perhaps the country's truest reflection, a socio-economic cross-section borne from common ideals. The problem is, this war is not being fought by World War II's citizen-soldiers. Nor is it fought by Vietnam's draftees. Its wages are paid by a small cadre of volunteers that composes about one-tenth of 1 percent of the population -- America's warrior class. 
 The insular nature of this group -- and a war that has spiraled into politicization -- has left the Americans disconnected and confused. It's as if they have been invited into the owner's box to settle a first-quarter disagreement on the coach's play-calling. Not only are they unprepared to talk play selection, most have never even seen a football game. 
 This confusion, in turn, affects our warriors, who are frustrated by the country's lack of cohesion and the depiction of their war. Iraq hasn't been easy on the military, either. But the strength of our warriors is their ability to adapt. 
 First, in battle you move forward from where you are, not where you want to be. No one was more surprised that Saddam Hussein had no weapons of mass destruction than the soldiers who rolled into Iraq in full chemical protective gear. But it is time for the rest of the country to do what the military was forced to: get over it. 
 If we can put 2003's debates behind us, there is a swath of common ground on which to focus. Both Republicans and Democrats agree we cannot lose Iraq. The general insurgency in Iraq imperils our national interest and the hardcore insurgents are our mortal enemies. Talking of troop reductions is to lose sight of the goal. 
 Second, America's conscience is one of its greatest strengths. But self-flagellation, especially in the early stages of a war against an enemy whose worldview is uncompromising, is absolutely hazardous. Three years gone and Iraq's most famous soldiers are Jessica Lynch and Lynndie England, a victim and a criminal, respectively. Abu Ghraib remains the most famous battle of the war.
 Soldiers are sick of apologizing for a sliver of malcontents who are not at all representative of the new breed. But they are also sick of being pitied. Our warriors are the hunters, not the hunted, and we should celebrate them as we did in the past, for while our tastes have changed, warfare -- and the need to cultivate national guardians -- has not. As Kipling wrote, ''The strength of the pack is the wolf.''
 Finally, today's debates are not high-spirited so much as mean-spirited. To allow polarizing forces to dominate the argument by insinuating false motives on one side or a lack of patriotism on the other is to obscure long-term security decisions that have to be made now. 
 We are clashing with an enemy who has been at war with us in one form or another for two decades. Our military response may take decades more. We have crossed several rivers and the nation is hoping that ahead lie streams. But if they are oceans, we should heed Lincoln's call: ''With malice toward none, with charity for all let us strive on to finish the work we are in.''

PERSON: Carolyn Shaw Bell

HEADLINE: Carolyn Shaw Bell, 85, Dies; Influential Economist 

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Carolyn Shaw Bell, an economist at Wellesley College who took her fight for equal opportunities for women in economics from the college into the national arena, died May 13 at her home in Arlington, Va. She was 85. 
 Mary Ann Hill, a college spokeswoman, announced Dr. Bell's death.
Dr. Bell started her work at Wellesley in 1950. By 1995, an article in The New York Times pointed to the ''Wellesley effect,'' a disproportionately large number of graduates of Wellesley, a women's college, in executive suites and corporate boardrooms. It said the college's alumnae had long been overrepresented at Harvard Business School and said part of the reason was the dynamic teaching of Dr. Bell.
 Dr. Bell carried her equality campaign to the American Economic Association, where she was a founder of the group's Committee on the Status of Women in the Economics Profession. In 1998, the committee established the Carolyn Shaw Bell Award for the person who has most advanced women in the profession.
 Her own scholarship focused on human capital, income distribution and the quality of economic data. She wrote two books, ''Consumer Choice in the American Economy'' (1967) and ''The Economics of the Ghetto'' (1970).
 In 1973, she was appointed an overseer of the Amos Tuck School of Business Administration at Dartmouth College, the first woman appointed to any governing board there.
 She advised the presidential campaign of Jimmy Carter and was rumored to be in consideration for a high economic post in his administration that never materialized. 
 She deeply influenced distinguished students like Alicia Munnell, an assistant secretary of the treasury and member of the Council of Economic Advisers in the Clinton administration and now a professor at the Carroll School of Management at Boston College. Professor Munnell recounted last week how Dr. Bell's help continued through correspondence and networking for many years after graduation.
 ''It was just to make sure that the students she came into contact with knew they could do anything they wanted to, and that she was behind them pushing and applauding all the way,'' Professor Munnell said. 
 Dr. Bell coined the term ''FEMS,'' for female economics majors, to describe her students and former students. Carolyn Shaw was born on June 21, 1920, in Framingham, Mass. She majored in economics at Mount Holyoke College, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa as a junior and graduated magna cum laude.
 She then worked at the Office of Price Administration, which was established during World War II to prevent inflation and was led by John Kenneth Galbraith, who later helped Dr. Bell create the committee of female economists. In 1949, she earned a doctorate at the London School of Economics.
 At her retirement in 1989, she held the Katharine Coman chair in economics at Wellesley and had been departmental chairwoman twice.
 Dr. Bell had moved to Arlington after living for many years in Lexington, Mass., and, previously, in Dover, Mass.
 Her husband, Nelson Sibly Bell, died in 1991. She is survived by her daughter, Tova Maria Solo of Arlington, and one grandson.

HEADLINE: Rules Collide With Reality In the Immigration Debate

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

DATELINE: MOUNT OLIVE, N.C. 

 BODY:
Six years after he came here from Mexico, David E. has a steady job in a poultry plant, a tidy mobile home and a minivan. Some days he almost forgets that he does not have legal documents to be in this country. 
 David's precarious success reflects the longtime disconnect between the huge number of Mexican immigrants the American economy has absorbed and the much smaller number the immigration system has allowed to enter legally.
 Like many Mexicans, David -- who spoke in Spanish and whose last name is being withheld because he feared being fired or deported -- was drawn by the near-certain prospect of work when he made his stealthy passage across the desert border in Arizona to this town among the cucumber fields of eastern North Carolina. 
 ''If I had the resources and the connections to apply to come legally,'' said David, 37, ''I wouldn't need to leave Mexico to work in this country.'' 
 In the foundering immigration system being debated in Congress, immigration from Mexico is a critically broken part and, researchers and analysts say, central to any meaningful fix. 
 By big margins, Mexican workers have been the dominant group coming to the United States over the last two decades, yet Washington has opened only limited legal channels for them, and has then repeatedly narrowed those channels. 
 ''People ask: Why don't they come legally? Why don't they wait in line?'' said Jeffrey S. Passel, a demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center, a research organization in Washington. ''For most Mexicans, there is no line to get in.''
 The United States offers 5,000 permanent visas worldwide each year for unskilled laborers. Last year, two of them went to Mexicans. In the same year, about 500,000 unskilled Mexican workers crossed the border illegally, researchers estimate, and most of them found jobs. 
 ''We have a neighboring country with a population of 105 million that is our third-largest trading partner, and it has the same visa allocation as Botswana or Nepal,'' said Douglas S. Massey, a sociology professor at Princeton.
 Several guest worker programs exist for Mexicans to come temporarily to the United States. But there is general agreement that those programs are inefficient, and employers often avoid them.
 The 11.6 million people born in Mexico who now live in the United States account for one-third of all residents who were born overseas, census figures show. About six million of the Mexican immigrants are here illegally, more than half of all the illegal immigrants in the country, Professor Passel estimated.
 For generations, starting with the Bracero program in the 1950's, Mexican men came to the United States to work for a few months each year before returning home to their families. But in the last 20 years, Mexicans ''have settled in the United States; they have kids born here,'' said Wayne Cornelius, director of the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies at the University of California, San Diego.
 ''Clearly there are some migrants who attempt to maintain an economic foothold in Mexico,'' Mr. Cornelius said. ''But their main project is to build their lives in the United States.''
 And so communities of illegal Mexican immigrants have sprung up in places like Mount Olive, a town far from the border with a famous pickle factory and a population of 5,000. Grocery stores on country roadsides carry corn tortillas -- authentic ones imported from Mexico. A Pentecostal church has services in Spanish only, and the Virgin of Guadalupe, Mexico's patroness, is a common image on key chains and mobile home walls. 
 In North Carolina, the immigrant population has nearly tripled since 1990, the biggest increase of any state in the nation, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan group in Washington. By far the biggest group of new immigrants in the state is illegal Mexicans.
 Stephen P. Gennett, president of the Carolinas chapter of the Associated General Contractors of America, which represents commercial builders, said Mexican immigrants filled an important gap in the labor market.
 ''We have a problem here: a people shortage,'' Mr. Gennett said. ''In the 90's, we began to feel the stress of an inadequate work force,'' he said. ''The Hispanics have been filling those jobs.''
 As Mexican immigration has accelerated, the United States has cut back on the permanent-resident visas available to unskilled Mexicans and shifted the system progressively away from an emphasis on labor, to favor immigrants with family ties to American citizens or legal residents, or who have highly specialized job skills. 
 The Bracero program was closed in the mid-1960's. In 1976, Congress imposed an annual limit of 20,000 permanent visas on each country in the Western Hemisphere, including Mexico. In 1978, in 1980 and again in the 1990's, further changes resulted in reductions of resident visas for Mexican workers. 
 In 1994, the North American Free Trade Agreement unleashed a surge of cross-border trade and travel, but at the same time the United States initiated the first in a series of measures to reinforce the border with Mexico to block the passage of illegal workers.
 For Mexicans who try to immigrate legally, the line can seem endless. A Mexican who has become a naturalized United States citizen and wants to bring an adult son or daughter to live here faces a wait of at least 12 years, State Department rosters show. The wait is as long as seven years for a legal resident from Mexico who wants to bring a spouse and young children. 
 Although David E. graduated from a Mexican university, he does not have an advanced degree, a rare skill or family ties to a legal United States resident that might have made him eligible for one of the scarce permanent visas. 
 Instead, he said, after he despaired of finding work at a decent wage in his home city, Veracruz, he discovered an alternative immigration system, the well-tried underground network of word-of-mouth connections. Contacts he made through the network helped him to make the trek to Arizona, traverse the country in a van loaded with illegal Mexicans and land a job eviscerating turkeys at a poultry plant in Mount Olive three weeks after he arrived. 
 David has been at the plant ever since, rising to become the chief of an assembly line but still working as much as 12 hours a day on a red-eye shift that ends at 3 a.m.
 From time to time he has made inquiries about becoming legal. But he said he was detained twice by the Border Patrol when he first tried to cross into the United States, and with that record, he feared that any approach to the immigration authorities might end in deportation. 
 Juvencio Rocha Peralta, the president of the Mexican Association of North Carolina, an advocacy group, said Mexicans felt trapped in a system that seemed contradictory.
 ''You make us break the law because you don't give us an opportunity to be legal,'' said Mr. Peralta, who came here as an illegal farm worker years ago but was granted amnesty in 1986 and is now a naturalized American citizen. ''You take my labor, but you don't give me documents.''
 Not far from here, on the outskirts of Raleigh at the Foxhall Village mobile home park, with its orderly grid of streets, illegal immigration is an open secret.
 Most residents are Mexicans who have been in North Carolina for a decade or more. Many work two jobs, and many are making payments to buy the mobile homes they occupy.
 In April, many residents, galvanized by disputes over rent increases with the mobile home park management, joined the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, knownas Acorn, and staged a protest march. 
 More than a dozen residents who gathered for a boisterous conversation at the park on May 16 acknowledged their illegal status, but said they had to risk coming forward to resolve their fight with park managers. 
 One park resident, Blanca Florian, 30, whose husband is a skilled construction worker, said she feared losing her mobile home if she did not speak up.
 ''I can't be hiding any longer,'' Ms. Florian said.

HEADLINE: Iran's Drive to Nuclear Fuel Has Slowed, Diplomats Say

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD and DAVID E. SANGER; Nazila Fathi contributed reporting from Tehran for this article.

 BODY:
After boasting last month that it had joined the ''nuclear club'' by successfully enriching uranium on an industrial scale -- and portraying its action as irreversible -- Iran appears to have slowed its drive to produce nuclear fuel, according to European diplomats who have reviewed reports from inspectors inside the country.
 The diplomats say the slowdown may be part of a deliberate Iranian strategy to lower the temperature of its standoff with the West over its nuclear program, and perhaps to create an opening for Washington to join the negotiations directly -- something President Bush has so far refused to do.
In discussions with White House and State Department officials in recent days, Europeans have described the inspectors' findings, clearly hoping to influence a debate within the Bush administration over whether to change strategy and engage directly with Iran. But hard-liners in the administration say they are unconvinced and think any slowdown may be merely a tactical ploy by the government of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. ''It could simply mean we're not looking in the right places,'' said one senior official with access to the intelligence and who has long suspected that Iran has a secret weapons program. 
 Nuclear experts, accustomed to measuring the efficiency of uranium centrifuges rather than of diplomatic initiatives, caution, too, that the slowdown may mean that Iran has run into technical obstacles on its nuclear road. Centrifuges are machines whose rotors spin extraordinarily fast to enrich, or concentrate, uranium into material that can fuel nuclear reactors or atom bombs.
 Diplomats, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the topic's political delicacy, say that Iranian engineers stopped pouring a raw form of uranium, called UF6, into arrays of centrifuges after just 12 days, even as the nation erupted in celebrations of the enrichment feat. The reports, which have now been widely circulated, say the Iranians kept the empty centrifuges spinning, as is standard practice because slowing the delicate machines can cause them to wobble and crash. 
 Understanding why the enrichment run was so short -- and why Iran has failed to put more centrifuges into operation -- are the newest mysteries about its program.
 ''The pace is more diplomatic than technical,'' said a senior European diplomat who monitors the Iranian program, and who has told the Bush administration that he believes the slowdown could be a signal. ''They could probably have gone faster. But they don't want to provoke.''
 But they also do not want to stop, and that is the crux of the standoff.
 Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, reaffirmed in a meeting with Parliament members yesterday that Iran would not back down in the face of Western pressure over its nuclear program. 
 ''The young Iranian engineers, with their success in nuclear technology, have in fact guaranteed the long-term energy future for the country,'' Ayatollah Khamenei said, the Iranian Student News Agency reported. ''We must not give up this achievement at any price, because retreat is a 100 percent loss.'' 
 As Ayatollah Khamenei was meeting with members of Parliament, the secretary of the Russian National Security Council, Igor S. Ivanov, held a three-hour meeting with Iran's chief nuclear negotiator, Ali Larijani. Officials in Tehran said that the two were discussing the prospect of conducting uranium enrichment in Russia, and that Mr. Ivanov was pushing Iran to accept a European proposal of economic aid in return for ending its enrichment program.
 Meanwhile, President Bush and his advisers have maintained that no negotiations can resume between Europe and Iran ''while one centrifuge spins'' in the country. ''Once they master the technology, it would be easier for them to go underground with a covert program,'' Greg Schulte, the American ambassador to the atomic energy agency, said in Washington last week. ''They appear to be moving forward very methodically to develop that knowledge.''
 So far, Britain and France have held to the same view, though German officials have begun to argue that allowing a low level of Iranian enrichment activity -- essentially, allowing the Iranians to maintain their current activity -- is harmless. ''They've cracked the code,'' one senior German official said last week. ''We're kidding ourselves if we think we are going to deny them the knowledge'' of how to produce nuclear fuel.
 Whether Tehran and Washington can find any face-saving middle ground could depend on how quickly the Iranians move toward, or delay, what they say is the next phase: building new centrifuges, with the aim of installing nearly 1,000 by the end of this year. 
 If the Iranians were racing forward, experts say, they would have made substantial progress in installing those centrifuges. But they have not. One senior European diplomat said such delays could reflect a decision to pause for scientific evaluation as well as a diplomatic effort ''not to rock the boat.''
 The action, or lack of it, centers on the desert south of Tehran, where Iran has built a sprawling industrial site near the city of Natanz that includes a pilot enrichment plant.
 It was there, on April 11, that the Iranians announced that they had enriched uranium to the low levels needed to fuel a nuclear reactor. They depicted the achievement as just the start of a sprint. ''Our young scientists are working day and night,'' Gholamreza Aghazadeh, who is in charge of Iran's Atomic Energy Agency, told an Iranian television interviewer the next day. ''People are shocked and surprised that this has happened so quickly.''
 Then, on April 28 in Vienna, the International Atomic Energy Agency reported that the Iranians were assembling two more cascades, or strings of centrifuges, each consisting of 164 machines. On May 17, David Albright, the president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a research group in Washington that tracks the Iranian program, told Congress that those cascades were expected to start operating in May and June, respectively.
 But in an interview last week, a diplomat close to the international watchdog agencies disclosed that the atomic agency would report soon that the Iranians had made little progress on the new cascades. 
 That would be a setback, at least as measured by Iran's declared intentions. It has said the pilot plant is to hold a total of six cascades made up of 984 centrifuges -- a goal nuclear analysts expected Iran to achieve later this year. They see that as roughly the minimum number of centrifuges Iran would need to enrich enough uranium to make a single bomb. Analysts say that if the complicated plant worked reliably and efficiently, and if Tehran decided to throw out the inspectors and abandon its obligations under the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, using the cascades to make fuel for a nuclear weapon would take a little more than two years.
 The assessments of Iran's progress, however, are hampered because Tehran has curtailed its cooperation with nuclear inspectors and sharply limited their ability to follow their hunches around the country. The inspectors still have a legal right under the nonproliferation treaty to track radioactive materials and their manipulation, giving them a window into the pilot plant at Natanz. But they cannot look at other buildings, and the Iranians have barred them from monitoring the manufacturing of centrifuges.
 Even peering through the keyhole, the International Atomic Energy Agency'sfindings and Tehran's own statements have combined to raise questions about its claims of irreversible breakthroughs in developing indigenous nuclear technology. 
 For instance, the inspectors found that Iran in the first enrichment campaign used not only its own raw uranium but material it had imported from China. Its domestic supplies are reportedly laced with impurities that can reduce the efficiency of delicate centrifuges or cut their lives short. 
 In addition, the centrifuges that Iran is running appear to be inefficient. Mr. Aghazadeh's remarks after the announcement last month contained detailed information on the rate at which Iran's centrifuges had enriched uranium, allowing Western experts to calculate their efficiency. While the cascade worked, ''It didn't operate well,'' Mr. Albright of the Institute for Science and International Security said in an interview, echoing his May 17 Congressional testimony. 
 But a European nuclear expert who closely monitors the atomic energy agency's work said that such low efficiencies were characteristic of initial centrifuge efforts, and that the Iranians would undoubtedly improve their record as they gained experience.
 Over all, the first diplomat said, the Iranians, despite start-up problems, had clearly pushed enrichment into the industrial phase, confronting the world with a strengthened nuclear agenda. ''They crossed the Rubicon in terms of having the basic knowledge,'' he said. ''And that has changed the dynamic.''

HEADLINE: Target of F.B.I. Had Bold Climb To Capitol Hill 

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW and ROBERT PEAR; Christopher Drew reported from New Orleans for this article, and Robert Pear from Washington. Adam Nossiter contributed reporting from New Orleans.

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, May 27 

 BODY:
Representative William J. Jefferson has always liked to talk about growing up in an impoverished farm community, picking cotton for $3 a day and hitting the books hard enough to win his ticket out -- a scholarship to Harvard Law School.
 But even as Mr. Jefferson built a reputation as one of Louisiana's brightest, most effective leaders, a less flattering view began to emerge, one signified by his nickname in political circles, ''Dollar Bill.''
Early in his career, as a state legislator, he was criticized for enriching his law firm with contracts from state and local agencies. He also ran stores that rented appliances by the month to poor residents, owned dilapidated apartment buildings and was sued by federal regulators over a defaulted loan. 
 Now, with the Federal Bureau of Investigation raid on his Capitol Hill office on May 20, Mr. Jefferson, a 59-year-old Democrat, is under investigation for possibly turning his efforts to promote trade with Africa into another sideline worth hundreds of thousands of dollars -- and has become the central figure in a political drama consuming Washington. 
 The unprecedented raid has set off a huge institutional showdown, with Republican leaders including J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, the speaker of the House, challenging the White House and criticizing the F.B.I.'s actions. Democratic leaders have also stood by the speaker's side.
 [Continuing the twists and turns, Senator Bill Frist, the majority leader, broke with his colleagues on Sunday, saying there was nothing wrong with the F.B.I.'s actions. Page A12.]
 President Bush has stepped into the fray, ordering the F.B.I. to seal any records it seized and calling for a 45-day cooling-off period to allow time to resolve the crisis. 
 The raid on Mr. Jefferson's office took place barely a week ago. But in a sense, the questions circling him have long resonances in his career, which was shaped by a remarkable ascent from the deepest poverty and a quest for the comforts his family never had.
 In a 95-page affidavit released after the raid, the F.B.I. accused Mr. Jefferson, an eight-term lawmaker, of demanding more than $400,000 in bribes to help iGate Inc., a technology company based in Kentucky, obtain lucrative contracts in Africa. The bureau said it had also videotaped him accepting a suitcase with $100,000 in cash and later found $90,000 of it in his freezer. 
 Though the details were blacked out, the affidavit also said the F.B.I. had ''evidence linking Congressman Jefferson to at least seven other schemes'' in which he ''sought things of value in return for his performance of official acts.''
 Mr. Jefferson has vigorously denied wrongdoing and has not been charged with a crime. ''I certainly did not sell my office,'' Mr. Jefferson said in a recent statement. ''The government seems inclined to view the facts in the worst possible light, and to characterize events that could be explained, or are exculpatory, in ways that tend to incriminate.''
 Whether his actions were criminal or not, several people who have long known Mr. Jefferson said he had often seemed driven by a desire to escape his spartan roots. 
 ''There was always a feeling among those who knew him as Dollar Bill that having grown up as poor as he did, his hunger for wealth always burned,'' said Allan Katz, a New Orleans political consultant. 
 Mr. Jefferson, a taciturn man who began his career as a favorite of good-government groups, has built a political empire in New Orleans, winning re-election by wide margins and helping his sister, one of his five daughters and many allies win public offices.
 Standing outside a new post office that Mr. Jefferson helped bring to his district, one voter, Joyce F. Smith, said that if the accusations were true, ''I'd be very disappointed because he's been a very good congressman.''
 But many people here have been joking about his ''frozen assets'' and ''cold cash.'' And Ms. Smith added, it is ''hard for me to believe'' that he would have stashed legitimate earnings in frozen-food containers and aluminum foil.
 Mr. Jefferson was raised, along with eight brothers and sisters, on a small farm in northeast Louisiana, where, he said earlier this year, ''our whole life revolved around that cotton field.'' His father left school after second grade, and his mother attended only through eighth grade. 
 As a child, Mr. Jefferson was such a good shot, his father once said, that when it came time to bag dinner, ''if I wanted one rabbit, I'd give him one shell; and if I needed two rabbits, I'd give him two.'' 
 After he graduated from Southern University in Baton Rouge in 1969, Mr. Jefferson has said, he won his mother's blessing to go to Harvard Law School -- she had never heard of it -- only by explaining that it had been John F. Kennedy's college.
 Mr. Jefferson has credited his parents with pressing the value of hard work. Elizabeth Brannum Trass, one of his high school teachers, said in an interview that he had always had the seriousness of purpose that helped catapult him onto a much faster track.
 A clerkship with a United States district judge brought Mr. Jefferson to New Orleans in 1972. He got into politics as a campaign aide for Ernest N. Morial, who became the city's first black mayor in 1978 and gave Mr. Jefferson the Dollar Bill nickname.
 Friends of both men said the mayor thought Mr. Jefferson had tried too aggressively to collect legal fees for helping Mr. Morial win the election. But after Mr. Jefferson became a state senator in 1979, his political rivals began to use ''Dollar Bill'' to refer to his expanding financial ventures.
 His rental business -- which leased television sets and other appliances to people who could not afford to buy them -- appeared on the delinquent list in a city sales-tax scandal in the 1980's. And a day after he was elected to Congress in 1990, the Resolution Trust Corporation, which was trying to clean up the mess from the collapse of savings institutions, sued him for $160,000 over an apartment-building loan on which he had quit making payments. He later settled the suit, with friends saying his investments had been hurt by a faltering economy.
 Still, once Mr. Jefferson became a close ally of President Bill Clinton, and then won a seat on the powerful House Ways and Means Committee, he was able to provide ''absolute A+'' support for city projects, said Marc H. Morial, one of Ernest Morial's sons and the mayor of New Orleans from 1994 to 2002.
 Mr. Jefferson also became known as a strong advocate of freer trade and made at least nine trips to Africa to promote it, including one with President Clinton. He championed a 2000 law that extended trade benefits to sub-Saharan Africa. ''Africa is a reservoir of opportunities for American businesses,'' he said then. 
 Over the years, Mr. Jefferson has received campaign contributions and free travel from individuals and companies seeking business in Africa, including iGate. 
 Campaign finance records show he received a $1,000 contribution as early as 2001 from Vernon L. Jackson, the chief executive of iGate, which makes technology to transmit high-speed Internet service across the wires used in some African nations. Mr. Jackson pleaded guilty this month to bribing Mr. Jefferson with more than $400,000 in cash and millions of shares of iGate stock.
 Government documents show that Mr. Jackson told the F.B.I. that when he metMr. Jefferson in late 2000, the congressman voluntarily helped promote iGate's products -- a normal and legitimate action for a government official involved in trade issues. But according to the F.B.I. documents, in early 2001, the congressman's actions became improper when he said he would continue to use his influence on iGate's behalf only if Mr. Jackson made payments to a company, the ANJ Group, run by the Jefferson family. The iGate payments were disguised as consulting fees, the F.B.I. said.
 Mr. Jefferson says these were private business dealings that had nothing to do with his work on the House committee.
 But as part of a 2003 deal to distribute iGate's products, a Nigerian company, Netlink Digital Television, agreed to pay the congressman $5 per subscriber, the F.B.I. affidavit said, ''in return for Jefferson's official assistance if the deal was successful.''
 House records show that in February 2004, Mr. Jefferson led a business delegation to Nigeria and Cameroon as a co-chairman of the Congressional Nigeria Caucus and the Africa Trade and Investment Caucus. The trip, which cost $16,313, according to the records, was paid for in part by iGate.
 In 2005, the F.B.I. said, Mr. Jefferson wrote to the vice presidents of Nigeria and Ghana, and traveled to Ghana, seeking approval for iGate projects. Within a week after returning, the F.B.I. said, Mr. Jefferson used his influence to help a Virginia woman, Lori Modi, who had invested $3.5 million in the Nigeria project. He introduced her to officials at the Export-Import Bank of the United States and urged them to provide financing for the project.
 But by then, Ms. Modi had asked the F.B.I. to investigate the deal. 
 Investigators said that in negotiating the deals, Mr. Jefferson had often cited his desire to provide for his five daughters, three of whom also have degrees from Harvard Law School.
 From December 2004 through June 2005, the F.B.I. said in its affidavit, Mr. Jefferson increased his demands for equity in one Nigerian company, to 30 percent, to be split among his daughters. He also told an investor that one of his daughters had to be retained to do legal work, according to documents in the case. 
 Then, on July 30, 2005, when Mr. Jefferson met Ms. Modi at a Ritz-Carlton hotel, the F.B.I. said it supplied her with a briefcase with $100,000 in marked bills. Mr. Jefferson had told her the money would be needed to bribe Nigerian officials, the affidavit said.
 As the F.B.I.'s video cameras zoomed in on him, the bureau said, Mr. Jefferson drove off with the briefcase on the seat of his Lincoln Town Car. And when agents raided his home four days later, $90,000 of the money turned up again, in the kitchen freezer.

HEADLINE: Diesel a Savior in Squeeze On Energy? Obstacles Exist

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26 

 BODY:
Forget about navigation systems and sunroofs -- the sales pitch at a time of sky-high fuel prices may soon be a tempting patter about high mileage for buyers of the newest diesel models. 
 With a new kind of diesel fuel entering the market in the next few days; new technologies that vastly reduce problems with noise, smell and performance; and federal tax benefits like the ones offered for hybrid-electric vehicles, car manufactures are hoping to get consumers excited about more diesel-powered cars and sport utility vehicles.
Though President Bush, who often mentions diesels as a promising way to promote a sharp rise in fuel economy, has laid out goals to reduce oil imports, those goals may be extremely difficult to reach, some experts say. Some auto industry experts predict that with new technology and tax breaks, the American market could become more like that of Europe, where half of new autos are diesel powered. There is some doubt, however, over whether refineries can keep up with that demand without a sharp rise in diesel prices. 
 Kevin B. McMahon, director of the Martec Group, a consulting and market research firm in Detroit, said consumers who now buy gasoline pickups or cars and choose an optional bigger engine, giving up a mile or two per gallon of fuel economy, will soon buy diesels instead.
 ''Diesels deliver the kind of premium performance and exceptional durability that customers want, and they are willing to pay a premium to acquire,'' Mr. McMahon said. 
 The government is already on board. Last summer's energy bill makes so-called clean diesels eligible for the same tax breaks as hybrids, and Mr. Bush has said that diesels could help solve what he has called the nation's addiction to oil by going 30 percent farther per gallon than gasoline-powered vehicles. Such diesels will be on the market in a few years.
 But some experts caution that there may be less there than meets the eye. For one thing, diesel is still a form of petroleum, and the ability of refineries to produce it in lieu of gasoline is limited. And it would take expensive investment to change the gasoline-to-diesel production ratio.
 In Europe, diesel demand is high and growing by 1.5 percent a year, and ''that's impossible to accommodate in a refinery,'' said Gene Tunison, manager of fuels development and policy planning at ExxonMobil.
 Instead, European refineries are processing more crude oil to keep up with diesel demand and accumulating surplus gasoline that they export to the United States. That system is working because the United State has a shortage of refinery capacity, but if every country were to embark on a diesel strategy, refining would have to change radically, experts say.
 Today, gasoline accounts for about half of what American refineries produce. An additional 25 percent is diesel or home-heating oil, and about 10 percent is jet fuel. Diesel, heating oil and jet fuel are similar products, and their price is set by a market that is only loosely tied to gasoline. Supply and demand make diesel more expensive than unleaded regular gas at some times, and less expensive at others. 
 Globally, demand for all three products is rising, said Joanne Shore, a senior analyst at the Energy Information Administration. A milestone was reached last year when diesel fuel, which usually sells at a discount to gasoline, reached parity. Sales of diesel vehicles will be limited in areas where diesel costs more, Ms. Shore predicted. 
 But new technology and regulatory policy are creating the possibility of more attractive diesel vehicles. Beginning June 1, refineries must produce what is known as ultra-low sulfur diesel, with no more than 15 parts per million of sulfur, down from 500 parts per million. Removal of sulfur will allow car companies to install filters to catch soot (current diesel fuel would overwhelm a filter).
 ''It's analogous to taking the lead out of gasoline,'' said Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the Diesel Technology Forum, a trade group. Lead-free gasoline allowed the installation of catalytic converters in cars to control tailpipe emissions. In October, the low-sulfur diesel must be available at filling stations. That, said Mr. Schaeffer, ''really opens up the door for the entire diesel industry.''
 Daimler-Chrysler, Volkswagen and other carmakers are selling or preparing to sell diesel vehicles in the United States. On Wednesday, Honda announced that it would be selling a four-cylinder diesel car in North America soon.
 While low-sulfur content fuel has allowed the introduction of cleaner vehicles, other technologies that will limit emission of nitrogen oxides, an ingredient of smog, will probably be on the road around 2008. And new computerized controls that inject fuel more efficiently have increased power and reduced noise, so that diesel engines are often indistinguishable from gasoline engines. 
 But the energy-consumption and environmental benefits are less clear. While there are more miles per gallon -- 20 percent to 40 percent more, according to advocates -- the reduction in global-warming gases is not as pronounced because diesel has more carbon in it than gasoline does, and thus produces more carbon dioxide per gallon burned.
 Diesel goes farther for two reasons. One is that when the hydrocarbons in a barrel of oil are rearranged and sorted into a variety of products, the ones going into diesel have more energy than those that go into gasoline. A gallon of diesel has about 128,000 B.T.U.'s, while gasoline has about 115,000. 
 The second reason is energy efficiency. Diesel engines get more work out of each B.T.U. because they squeeze the fuel-air mixture tighter before combustion.
 Advocates also say an advantage of burning diesel is that there are two sources for the fuel that have nothing to do with the petroleum. Substitutes can be made from coal and soybeans. 
 Margo T. Oge, director of the office of transportation and air quality at the Environmental Protection Agency, said that because improvements to meet diesel tailpipe emission standards were close, efficiency gains were ''more real for our society than looking at a fuel cell,'' which is much farther into the future. 
 But Lee Schipper, a former oil industry executive who leads a transportation and environmental study program at the World Resources Institute, said that what pushed European drivers to diesel was tax policy. Diesel buyers there tend to drive more, he said however, so they save no net fuel.
 For the United States, he wondered whether it was ''worth converting refineries and all that, to save what you would ultimately save, when you might get the same improvement from hybridization and improvement in gasoline technologies?''

HEADLINE: A Few Companies Take Special Steps to Curb Emissions

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD

 BODY:
When Timberland, the outdoor clothing company, studied ways to reduce its carbon emissions four years ago, it weighed several options: building a wind farm in the Dominican Republic, buying power generated by renewable resources and setting up a vast bank of solar panels at one of its distribution centers in Ontario, Calif. 
 It chose to do all those things, but that was the easy part. When Jeffrey B. Swartz, Timberland's president and chief executive, considered how much carbon dioxide was produced in making leather for the company's famous boots, the answer came as a surprise.
''As it turns out, the vast majority of the greenhouse gases associated with manufacturing leather comes from cows in the field,'' Mr. Swartz said. ''Yes, methane.'' 
 While Timberland figures out how to reduce these emissions -- it is examining ways to change the feed for cows -- the company has already cut its greenhouse gases by 17 percent from their 2002 level and aims to become carbon-neutral by 2010 by offsetting its emissions through renewable or alternative energy sources. 
 Americans are increasingly recognizing that the effects of carbon emissions on global warming are a serious problem, but there are no rules in the United States regulating heat-trapping gases comparable to those that most other developed countries have adopted under the Kyoto Protocol. Some United States businesses, though, are responding for a variety of reasons anyway: to satisfy customers or shareholders who worry about the environment, to improve their public image or to drive down their energy costs. In addition, some states and local authorities have stepped in to try to curb their contributions to global warming.
 For Timberland, while it shares the concerns over global warming, it's mostly a matter of dollars and cents. As Mr. Swartz put it: ''What idiot will leave costs on the table? I hope it's our competitors. I get paid to create value.''
 But reducing carbon emissions is no easy task.
 Scientists, economists, environmentalists and a growing rank of business leaders warn that corporate America needs to move more quickly or it will face the consequences: higher energy prices, a potential cost for carbon pollution and, eventually, products that will have trouble competing globally because other countries are reducing emissions.
 The United States is responsible for a quarter of all the carbon dioxide sent into the atmosphere each year. It has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol, the treaty on climate change that went into effect last year for more than three dozen countries in Europe and elsewhere, that set targets and timetables for cutting emissions. 
 If consumption of fossil fuels continues at today's pace, the Energy Department predicts that carbon emissions in the United States could rise to more than eight billion tons by 2030 -- 38 percent above current levels -- as energy use keeps growing. 
 ''This is a huge challenge for American businesses, particularly those trying to compete internationally,'' said Adam Markham, executive director of Clean Air-Cool Planet, an advocacy group in Portsmouth, N.H. ''Most of the rest of the developing world has a legislative mandate to curb emissions, but in the United States, in many cases, there is no real reason for companies to act.''
 Many analysts predict that the United States will eventually set rules limiting greenhouse emissions. Then, carbon pollution will turn into a cost of doing business.
 In Europe, for example, companies that go over their emission limits must buy carbon credits to comply. Under the continent-wide trading system, the cost of a carbon credit reached a high of 30.5 euros for each metric ton, or about $39, last month. (In the last month, prices have dropped by half as many power plants reported much lower emissions than expected.)
 But only 86 companies in the United States, accounting for 8 percent of domestic carbon emissions, have enrolled in Climate Leaders, the Environmental Protection Agency's voluntary program to cut emissions. Emissions in the United States have risen 16 percent since 1990, the agency said. 
 ''There is certainly a lot of inertia in the economy, and many companies have their heads in the sand, wishing and hoping that somehow the overwhelming consensus among scientists is going to go away,'' said Alan Nogee, director of the clean energy program at the Union of Concerned Scientists, based in Cambridge, Mass. But it's not. And ultimately their shareholders and customers are likely to pay a price. The reality is that carbon regulation is coming inevitably to the United States, as it has to the rest of the world.''
 Freezing emissions at today's levels will not solve global warming. Experts say that large reductions in global emissions -- 50 percent or more by 2050 -- are needed to stop carbon concentrations from rising. But reaching that goal requires a major transformation of how economies and businesses operate.
 ''It's going to change everything we do,'' said Joseph J. Romm, an analyst at the Center for Energy and Climate Solutions, a group that helps businesses lower emissions. 
 Environmental regulations and energy saving are not new. Since the 1970's and 1980's, when energy saving policies became popular in reaction to high fuel prices, the global economy has made huge strides in efficiency. 
 But economic activity has grown at the same time, and carbon emissions along with it. 
 ''There is a lot that companies can do, especially in the area of energy efficiency,'' said Ashok Gupta, an economist at the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group in New York. 
 Not surprisingly, the biggest strides have been achieved by corporations with operations outside the United States. I.B.M. and DuPont, for example, have long had programs to curb their energy use. In doing so, they have managed to cut manufacturing costs while decreasing their emissions.
 At DuPont, the savings from energy projects has totaled $2 billion over the last decade and a half. I.B.M. saved $115 million since 1998 by avoiding 1.3 million tons of carbon emissions, or the equivalent of taking 51,600 cars off the road, according to the climate change program at the World Wildlife Fund. 
 Other companies, like 3M, Advanced Micro Devices and the Gap, have pledged voluntary reductions in their emissions. Wal-Mart, the world's biggest retailer, announced a sweeping set of environmental goals last October, including doubling its truck fleet's efficiency and improving energy efficiency at its stores. 
 Johnson & Johnson decided in the late 1990's to meet the Kyoto requirements globally. From 1990 to 2005, the company reduced carbon emissions by 11.5 percent. Meanwhile, sales grew by 350 percent.
 ''We have not sacrificed business growth to meet our carbon emissions,'' said Dennis Canavan, the executive director for worldwide energy management at Johnson & Johnson. ''As Kyoto has recognized, the environment only sees the absolute amount of carbon you reduce. Allowing emissions to grow will take us to a bad place.''
 But some business areas remain averse to change. The transportation sector and utilities account for more than 55 percent of all emissions; they are mainly reluctant to commit to reductions without a federal mandate. 
 Last month, the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources held hearings on climate change that led to a few surprises. Some utilities, breaking with their trade group, asked Congress to set mandatory limits on carbon emissions. 
 Exelon and Duke Energy, the nation'slargest utility owners, said they favored a mandatory cap on emissions. As big users of nuclear power, they stand to benefit more than competitors that burn coal. But they also note that firm rules would level the playing field for everyone. 
 ''Customers and shareholders need greater certainty,'' Ruth G. Shaw, a senior executive at Duke Energy, told the Senate committee. But Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, said it would be impossible to adopt any law this year because of election-year gridlock. 
 David G. Hawkins, who ran the air pollution program at the Environmental Protection Agency in the Carter administration, said that many utilities were not happy with the current lack of policy.
 ''At a minimum, the absence of a controlled program creates uncertainty,'' said Mr. Hawkins, now the director of the Climate Center at the Natural Resources Defense Council. 
 Local and regional governments have stepped in to fill the gap. California and nine Northeastern states have drawn up plans to limit carbon emissions, and so have many cities. 
 Automakers have also resisted changing. David Friedman, an auto specialist with the Union of Concerned Scientists, said the average fuel economy of vehicles in the United States today -- about 25 miles a gallon -- had dropped by about one mile a gallon in the last 20 years. Most of the improvements in engine efficiency, however, have been lost because Detroit carmakers built larger cars and trucks.
 ''The automobile industry always feels it is difficult to make changes, whether on safety regulation, on seat belts, on emission standards, on smog and on global warming,'' Mr. Friedman said. ''They always had to be forced to make progress.'' 
 Bill McKibben, a resident scholar at Middlebury College in Vermont and the author of ''The End of Nature,'' a book about global warming, said there was no single answer.
 ''What people don't get is the scale of what needs to be done,'' he said. ''Anybody whose solution includes the phrase 'in 20 years,' hasn't quite caught on to where we are.''

HEADLINE: Technology and Easy Credit Give Identity Thieves an Edge

BYLINE: By JOHN LELAND and TOM ZELLER Jr.

DATELINE: PHOENIX 

 BODY:
In a Scottsdale police station last December, a 23-year-old methamphetamine user showed officers a new way to steal identities. 
 His arrest had been unremarkable. This metropolitan area, which includes Scottsdale and Phoenix, has the highest rate of identity theft complaints in the nation, according to the Federal Trade Commission. Even members of the Scottsdale police force have had their identities stolen.
But the suspect showed officers something they had not seen before. Browsing a government Web site, he pulled up a local divorce document listing the parties' names, addresses and bank account numbers, along with scans of their signatures. With a common software program and some check stationery, the document provided all he needed to print checks in his victims' names -- and it was all made available, with some fanfare, by the county recorder's office. The site had thousands of them. 
 The data were not as rich as some found in stolen mail or trash bins. But for law enforcement officials here, this was another turn in a cat-and-mouse game in which criminals have outpaced most efforts to stop them. 
 ''We're trying to keep up with the technology,'' said Lt. Craig Chrzanowski, who runs Scottsdale's property crimes division, including a computer crimes unit started two years ago. ''But they're getting a lot better.'' 
 In an economy that runs increasingly on the instantaneous flow of information and credit -- aggressively promoted by banks and credit card companies despite the risks -- Phoenix and its surrounding area provide a window on one of the system's unintended consequences.
 According to a Federal Trade Commission survey in 2003, about 10 million Americans -- 1 in 30 -- had their identities stolen in the previous year, with losses to the economy of $48 billion. Subsequent surveys, by Javelin Strategy and Research, a private research company, found that the number of victims had declined to nine million last year but that the losses had risen to $56.6 billion. 
 In Arizona, one in six adults had their identities stolen in the last five years, about twice the national rate, according to the Javelin survey. 
 Arizona officials have responded with a preventive mantra: shred all documents and avoid giving Social Security numbers or bank account numbers to strangers over the telephone or the Internet. The State Legislature has passed tougher penalties for people caught stealing or trafficking in stolen identities. 
 But the real problem, many officials and consumer advocates say, lies elsewhere. In recent years banks have campaigned energetically to extend more credit to more people with fewer hassles, and retailers and consumers have embraced instant, near-anonymous access to credit.
 Last year a group of prosecutors, law enforcement officers and security executives from banks and credit card associations met to discuss ways of curbing identity theft. The group had plenty of ideas, including PIN numbers or fingerprint verification for all credit card purchases and a ban on mailings that include blank checks. 
 But all ran counter to the promotional campaigns of banks and, banks say, to the desires of consumers. 
 ''There's a disconnect between corporate leadership at financial institutions and their security departments,'' said Brad H. Astrowsky, a former prosecutor who was part of the group. ''Marketing people are ruling the day in banking. They can do things to fix the problem, but they have no incentive and motivation to do it. Preventing something from happening is a cost. What's the benefit? It's hard to quantify.''

A Hot Spot for Thieves
 Several factors converge to make Arizona a hot spot for identity theft. Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, is one of the fastest-growing counties in the nation, according to the Census Bureau, and its growth exaggerates trends that exist in many communities: a mobile population and high numbers of immigrants and retirees. It also has a heavy traffic in methamphetamine.
 Methamphetamine users, whose binges keep them up for days in a row, have the time to sort through trash or old mail for Social Security numbers, bank account numbers or other identifying information, said Andrew P. Thomas, the county attorney. Dealers trade drugs for stolen identities that they use to launder their profits. Nearly half the identity theft cases in Mr. Thomas's office have a connection to methamphetamine, he said.
 At the same time, he added, ''More than half of the illegal immigrants entering the U.S. come through Arizona,'' creating a market for fraudulent Social Security numbers and driver's licenses.
 Though Arizona passed the nation's first identity theft law in 1996, law officers say they are fighting a crime that is as swift and adaptive as the economy it exploits. 
 The newest wave of thefts here involves copying the magnetic strip from a victim's credit card onto the back of another. When thieves use the doctored cards, the transactions are charged to their victims' accounts. ''Even if the cashier asks for my driver's license, the name on the front is going to match,'' said Todd C. Lawson, an assistant attorney general in Phoenix who specializes in identity theft prosecutions. 
 The machine to copy the magnetic strip, Mr. Lawson added, is the one nearly every hotel in America uses to recode room key cards. 
 And the county's Web site, which earned a place in the Smithsonian's permanent research collection on information technology innovation, has made Social Security numbers and other information, once viewable only by visiting the county recorder's office, accessible to anyone with an Internet connection. Police officers and prosecutors in Phoenix knew of just two cases involving public records, but most victims do not know how their identities are stolen.
 For local law enforcement, pursuing even low-tech, small-time thieves is often complicated and expensive. The victim could be in Arizona, the thief in another state and the transactions spread all over the world. ''If someone goes on the Internet and buys goods from Bangladesh, do you call witnesses from Bangladesh?'' asked Barnett Lotstein, a special assistant county attorney.
 Mr. Lawson said, ''I don't think we prosecute 5 percent of it.'' 
 On a recent afternoon, Lt. Russ Skinner, who runs the county sheriff's computer crimes division, hefted three vinyl binders onto a wooden table. For the detectives in his unit, this is what the ''crime of the 21st century'' looks like: photographs of litter-strewn hotel rooms, and of a 33-year-old woman in various stages of methamphetamine-fueled decline. 
 When detectives caught up with her last August, after nearly three months of investigation, the woman was paying other users to steal mail for her -- especially preapproved credit offers -- and had parlayed those into credit cards or fraudulent accounts in 46 different names. She had secured housing, utilities and a series of small online loans in her victims' names. 
 ''She wasn't the smartest or the most creative,'' Lieutenant Skinner said. ''She just knew how to get it done.''

A Connection to Drug Use
 In the past, a drug user who needed money might go into a convenience store with a gun, Lieutenant Skinner said. ''They're on the surveillance camera. They might get shot. They might get stopped in the parking lot for having a broken taillight,'' he said. ''Now they can just sit at a computer, no one sees them and they can buy whatever they want.''
 Officials here began to notice a sharp rise in identity theft about five years ago, said Paul K. Charlton, United States attorney for the District of Arizona. 
 ''The first tip-off was that we started to see a lot of mailbox break-ins by tweakers,'' Mr. Charlton said, referring to methamphetamine users. 
 When police officers raided home methamphetamine laboratories that were then proliferating on the outskirts of town, they found stacks of stolen mail or notebooks filled with credit card information. They also found thieves were using acetone, an ingredient used in methamphetamine production, to ''wash'' the ink off checks, a simple means of identity fraud. 
 These small laboratories lend themselves to identity theft rings, said John C. Horton, a White House aide in the Office of National Drug Control Policy. In a laboratory, one or two people typically have some technical knowledge, and others specialize in procuring materials. 
 Identity theft rings follow the same pattern, with a handful of grunts stealing mail for one person who knows how to turn the information into credit cards or checks, Mr. Horton said. ''It doesn't seem to happen with cocaine or heroin because we don't produce heroin and cocaine in this country,'' he said. ''Meth production is to some degree a social activity in the same way as identity theft.'' 
 Though the Arizona police have closed many laboratories, the identity theft rings have survived or multiplied. 
 From its commercial downtown, Phoenix extends in a patchwork of satellite communities, some so new that the highway connecting them does not appear on the maps in the central post office. In the mid-1990's, as Phoenix's population boomed, the Postal Service created cluster mailboxes that served whole housing developments. Like other conveniences associated with the city's rapid growth, the boxes have proved a boon for identity thieves. 
 ''You can jimmy one open and get everyone's mail at the same time,'' said Mr. Lawson, the prosecutor. After numerous break-ins, the Postal Service has spent $12 million on reinforced mailboxes, but many communities here still have the old ones. 
 Some thieves drive around neighborhoods with their laptops until they find a resident's unsecured wireless Internet connection. If the police investigate a fraudulent purchase, they will trace it to the customer with the connection, not to the thief who placed the order.
 Since 1994, a Phoenix security officer named Bob Hartle, frustrated by his own experience with identity theft, has led an often lonely campaign for tighter controls on organizations that handle people's data, and curbs on the way credit card companies, banks and stores grant credit. 
 Data breaches in the last year have exposed the personal information of more than 80 million Americans, according to the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit organization that follows identity theft. On May 3, a thief stole computer disks holding the names, Social Security numbers and other information of 26.6 million veterans from the residence of a Department of Veterans Affairs employee who had taken the data home without authorization. In most states, organizations are not required to tell consumers if their identities have been compromised. 
 ''It's the sharing of data without necessary safeguards that enables this crime to grow as it has,'' said Torin Monahan, an assistant professor of justice and social inquiry at Arizona State University. ''The response is always 'protect yourself, go to these workshops, get a shredder.' That diverts attention away from the extent to which these are systemic problems.'' 
 Seventeen states have passed ''credit freeze'' laws enabling consumers to prevent banks or credit agencies from issuing new accounts in their names. 
 But here, as in other states, businesses have successfully opposed such legislation. 
 ''They're fighting us tooth and nail,'' said Mr. Hartle, who runs ID Theft Services Inc., a nonprofit organization that provides free help for victims. 
 ''Banks, credit card companies, retailers want to make it easy to buy,'' Mr. Hartle said. ''They write off identity theft as a cost of doing business. So whenever legislation comes up that's going to cost them money, they throw themselves against it.''
 Nessa E. Feddis, senior federal counsel for the American Bankers Association, said freezing credit could create problems for consumers, especially if they needed to get a new cellphone or change residences in a hurry. 
 ''A credit freeze is one of those things that sounds like a good idea, but people don't realize how often they need to use their credit report,'' Ms. Feddis said. ''There's a balance between security and convenience.''
 She continued, ''We all want fraud to go away, but we don't want to take 20 extra minutes every time we do online banking. We like buying airline tickets online, but there's a risk.'' 
 Though consumers worry about identity theft, Ms. Feddis said, banks absorb most of the losses. 
 Credit card companies point to new monitoring systems that have reduced loss from fraud as a percentage of overall transaction volume. At Visa, fraud accounted for 7 cents per $100 in transactions, down from 18 cents per $100 in 1990. ''We could have a system reducing fraud to zero basis points, but it wouldn't meet what consumers are demanding,'' said Rosetta Jones, a Visa spokeswoman. ''We need to deliver what consumers want in a way that is secure.''
 Fritz M. Elmendorf, a spokesman for the Consumer Bankers Association, described a chess match with identity criminals. For example, banks now protect prescreened credit card offers with address-matching technologies that make it harder for thieves to have cards sent to a drop address, Mr. Elmendorf said. 
 ''There are more tools today than ever to ascertain the identity of a credit applicant,'' he said. ''And the industry can point to a lot of things -- some of which they won't talk about in detail -- to validate people.'' 
 In the community of Chandler, southeast of Phoenix, Bobby Joe Harris questioned the efforts of businesses and banks to protect his identity. 
 Mr. Harris, 60, is a retired police chief. His wife, Judy, is a retired bank manager. Last December, Mrs. Harris was shopping at a Sam's Club store when a cashier said their membership had been canceled. When Mr. Harris tried to reactivate their membership in January, he learned that the store had issued a new credit card on their account to a woman who had said she was the couple's daughter. 
 ''I don't have a daughter,'' Mr. Harris said. ''I told the lady, 'I don't think so.' ''
 In two phone calls, possibly working with a store employee, the thief had raised the Harrises' credit limit to $10,000 from $3,500 and then to $15,000, and had run up charges of $11,093. No one had called them. 
 ''It was only by luck that we found out,'' Mr. Harris said.

Seeking Protection
 Though like most consumer victims the Harrises did not have to pay the bogus charges, they now pay $220 a year to LifeLock, a protective service that started last September in Phoenix. 
 The company's core service is simple: Whenever a bank or other business requests to look at a LifeLock subscriber's credit history, the company gets a fraud alert asking to confirm that the customer applied for credit. Federal law empowers consumers to get these alerts on their own, but they must reapply regularly to one of the three companies that issue credit reports.
 Other companies offer different protections. None has had to prove that its services are effective.
 When the Maricopa County recorder's office began posting records online in 1997, it was one of the first in the country to do so. Since then, legislatures in other states, including New York and Florida, have wrestled with whether -- or how -- to make their information available online. 
 A law in Florida requires that all Social Security and financial account numbers be stripped from online records by 2007, although new legislation may delay that another year. 
 In Phoenix, the county recorder's office posts 8,000 to 10,000 documents a day. Most are innocuous, but some, including divorce decrees and tax lien records, have sensitive information. 
 ''I'm not insensitive to people's fear,'' said Helen Purcell, the county recorder. ''I have the same fear. My information is out there, too.'' But it is far too late to start editing Social Security numbers or other data from the county Web site, she said. ''We have 100 million documents out there now.'' 
 In the absence of full security, Arizonans cling to what protections they can. On a recent morning in Ventana Lakes, a development of older residents northwest of Phoenix, Lois Owen and Joan Schanks joined a small procession of neighbors to a community ''shredathon'' organized by the attorney general's office and AARP. Since the first shredathon last fall, residents around the state have carted 12 tons of paper to the mobile machines, in many cases supplementing the shredding they do at home.
 ''It's a big relief,'' Ms. Schanks said as she watched 20 pounds of old bank statements disappear. Yet even with the shredding, the residents here cannot begin to estimate how many people have their personal information, or how tempted any of those individuals may be to sell that information, Mr. Lawson, the prosecutor, said.
 ''You can take all the precautions you want,'' he said. ''But everyone's exposed to a certain extent.''

A Crime's Reach and Costs
 The ranks of identity theft victims are large. Just how large may depend on the definition.
 In broad terms -- including a thief's use of existing credit card, bank or other accounts -- the number of victims is about nine million a year, or roughly 4 percent of the United States adult population, according to surveys by Javelin Strategy and Research, an independent research firm, in tandem with the Better Business Bureau. 
 No exact measure of the crime's costs exists, but the Javelin study estimates, based on survey responses from victims, that the average annual cost per stolen identity is $6,300, a 22 percent increase since 2003. 
 The Javelin study also found that about three million Americans each year fall victim to the worst kind of identity theft: new account fraud.
 Here, pilfered names, Social Security numbers, dates of birth and other data are used to open new lines of credit, secure loans, flip property or otherwise turn a profit in a victim's name. This is much more time consuming -- and typically more costly -- to repair than fraudulent use of existing accounts.

Minimizing the Risks
Though no one's identity is safe from theft, consumer groups advise these steps:

Get a free credit report once a year (annualcreditreport.com) and report any suspicious activity.
Cancel unnecessary credit cards.
Do not carry your Social Security card in a wallet or purse.
Use credit cards, not debit cards, for online shopping.
Do not leave mail in an unlocked box.
Keep tax records and other documents in locked files. Many identity thieves are relatives, colleagues or home visitors or workers.
Reduce preapproved credit offers by contacting 888-5OPTOUT or visiting optoutprescreen.com.
If businesses ask for your Social Security number, ask to use other identification instead.

The Federal Trade Commission (consumer.gov/idtheft), the Privacy Rights Clearinghouse (privacyrights.org) and the Identity Theft Resource Center (idtheftcenter.org) have more information on preventing or recovering from identity theft.

14 Die in Afghan Riot After Crash of U.S. Truck
A traffic accident caused by a United States military convoy that killed five people escalated into an anti-American riot that raged across Kabul, the Afghan capital, leaving at least 14 people dead and scores injured. Witnesses said American soldiers fired on Afghans throwing stones at them after the crash, though the United States military said only that warning shots had been fired in the air. A1

More Reserve Troops to Iraq 

The top American commander in Iraq has decided to move reserve troops now deployed in Kuwait into the volatile Anbar Province in western Iraq to help quell a surge in insurgent attacks there, two American officials said. A1

Two Britons working as members of a CBS News television crew were killed and an American correspondent for the network was critically wounded when a military patrol they were accompanying was hit by a roadside bomb. The police said at least 31 other people were killed in one of the worst days of bloodshed in the capital for weeks. A10

Support for Haditha Accused
Denial and utter disbelief are the overwhelming reaction in Camp Pendleton, California, to reports of the killings in Haditha, Iraq, involving marines based at the camp. If there is any truth to the accusations, some say, then the troops must have been acting on direct orders, responding as they were trained to do. A11

Volcano Destabilized by Quake
Significant amounts of aid began arriving in Bantul, the town hit the hardest by an earthquake on Saturday, but Mount Merapi, a nearby volcano, has increased its threatening activity. Volcanologists said the quake destabilized a dome at the mountain's peak, which if it collapses, would set off a large eruption of lava, rocks and hot gas. A8

Israeli Policy Debate in Britain
Britain's biggest association of higher education instructors decided to urge its 67,000 members to consider boycotting Israeli academics who failed to renounce what it called Israel's ''apartheid policies'' in the West Bank and Gaza. A11

Call for Tiananmen Reparations
A group of 126 people whose relatives died in the suppression of the June 1989 pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tiananmen Square issued a joint appeal to reassess the incident and compensate victims, even as Chinese authorities worked to stop any commemorations of it as the anniversary approaches. A8

Corruption Behind Brazil Unrest
Fighting in Sao Paolo, Brazil between the police and criminal gangs that left at least 168 people dead has ceased, at least for now. The cause of the outbreak is what political leaders, lawyers and human rights groups describe as endemic corruption in law enforcement agencies and prisons. A3

HEADLINE: Holiday Travelers Hit the Road, but Scrimped a Bit

BYLINE: By JEFF BAILEY; Nick Bunkley, Cindy Chang, Jeremy W. Peters, Katie Zezima and Frank Bures contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Pam and Matt Keith spent Memorial Day weekend on a houseboat on Lake Oroville in Northern California. But because of high gasoline prices, the Keiths never even untied the boat from its mooring slightly offshore. When they ventured away from the shore, they supplied their own power -- in kayaks.
 It is a summer of restraint for the Keiths. They are trying to increase their savings, and to reach their goal, they canceled a weeklong trip later this summer to Maui, where they had planned to celebrate Ms. Keith's graduation from business school.
''We had booked it, the works,'' said Ms. Keith, 36. But money jitters got the better of her, she said. ''I'm a little paranoid because of the economy.'' 
 As the summer travel season began in earnest this past weekend, Americans were indulging their wanderlust, jamming highways, and filling airports, motels and eateries. But in some small ways, with possibly large consequences for the health of the economy, travelers interviewed across the country over the weekend said they were cutting their spending and downsizing their plans for summer trips. They're taking shorter, less expensive trips, as it sinks in that higher gasoline prices might be more than a temporary annoyance. Others are staying closer to home. 
 So while Americans might take as many trips this year as they did when gas prices where cheaper, there are plenty of signs that people are trying to offset the cost of the gas by scrimping elsewhere.
 Jeremy Miller, a 33-year-old carpenter from Verona, Wis., and his girlfriend went ahead with a trip this past weekend but pulled into a campsite closer to home to save gas. 
 ''Camping's gotten expensive,'' he said. ''After you count food, supplies, getting the site, gas and everything, we've probably spent over $400.''
 Businesses apparently sense the unease among travelers, and many hotels and tourist attractions have rushed out an array of gas-related rebates and discounts. 
 A trio of historic inns in Rockland, Maine, offer guests a discount on their bills equal to 10 times the number of cylinders in their vehicle's engine, up to $80 for a V-8. ''We don't want people to stay home because of the price of gas,'' said Pam Schultz, manager of the Captain Lindsey House, a 200-year-old Federal-style inn.
 Economists are still trying to gauge the impact of higher gas prices on consumers, and by extension, the broader economy. One vulnerable area, of course, is discretionary spending on things like travel; tourism pumps roughly half a trillion dollars into the United States economy every year. 
 Paying higher gas and other energy prices wiped out almost a third of the collective raises consumers earned last year, the United States Conference of Mayors reported last Friday. And the impact of higher oil prices is worse this year, with gasoline alone expected to cost consumers $300 billion, more than double the level of five years ago, the mayors group said.
 That helped send May's consumer confidence rating, as measured by the University of Michigan, to its lowest point since after last summer's hurricanes. In only three months in the last decade has consumer confidence been lower: the two months following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, and during the Iraq invasion in March 2003.
 ''They had thought the gas price run-up would be temporary,'' said Richard Curtin, director of the Michigan study. ''They're coming to the conclusion that gas prices will be permanently high.'' He called the combined impact on household budgets of higher gas prices and rising interest races ''corrosive.''
 That is certainly the case in Duarte, Calif., a working-class suburb of Los Angeles, where gas is $3.38 a gallon at some service stations. Inocencia Arteaga, 48, who makes about $85 a week babysitting, was once a road trip junkie, piling her family into her Chevy Astro van and motoring as far as Idaho whenever she could.
 Over Memorial Day weekend last year, she drove to San Francisco. But this year, she reluctantly stayed home, a family barbecue her entertainment. ''I have no money for gas,'' she said.
 To save on gas, her husband recently began bicycling the 10 miles to the Pasadena restaurant where he makes about $1,300 a month as a busboy.
 Even people with relatively high incomes are feeling squeezed. Celia Shane makes $65,000 a year as a legal secretary, and her husband Michael, a cooking instructor, makes $90,000.
 But they decided to forgo their annual jet-skiing trip to Laughlin, Nev., much to the disappointment of their two children, ages 6 and 12. They are barbecuing instead and saving the $70 per tank it now costs to fill up their minivan.
 On paper, the jump in gas prices should not have that much of an effect. For an 800-mile round trip, for example, the cost of an additional dollar per gallon adds up to $40 for a vehicle that gets 20 miles a gallon. But because the price is so prominently displayed as people drive, jumps can have a big impact on consumers' emotions. 
 So while Mr. Curtin, who oversees the consumer confidence survey, warns of the corrosive effects of rising gas prices, other economists are more sanguine. ''We start seeing $4 gas, instead of $3, then I worry,'' said Scott Hoyt, director of consumer economics at Moody's Economy.com, who expects that growth in consumer spending will moderate but remain healthy. 
 Likewise, Joel Naroff, president of Naroff Economic Advisers, says he does not believe that consumers yet think that $3-a-gallon gas is permanent. Unless or until they do, there won't be any significant change in overall spending, he said. ''You need the perception among households that this is long-term,'' he said. ''It's getting there, but I don't think we're there yet.''
 He has not spoken to John Fitzgerald, 38, a plumber in Norwell, Mass., who has cut back on family boating trips and is trying to unload the Ford Expedition that consumes about $100 of gas a week. ''We went to trade it in and they don't want to give us anything,'' Mr. Fitzgerald said.
 As consumers spend more for gas this year-- as well as for air fares, which are expected to be up 8 percent this year on average over last year -- economists wonder whether those extra dollars will subtract from other items. 
 ''So far, a buck spent on the gas tank is a buck not put in the savings account,'' said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard & Poor's. ''But there's a limit to that, and we may be reaching it.''
 As that limit is reached, Mr. Wyss added, travelers will stay in cheaper hotels, cook in the rented condo instead of dining out, and plan trips closer to home.
 Innkeepers and others are trying to take the sting out of high gas prices. The Emerson Inn by the Sea on Cape Ann in Massachusetts offers a $20 gas card for a two-night, midweek stay, and the reward grows by $10 for each additional night to a maximum of $50. The discount represents less than 6 percent of the total bill, but the owners hope it entices travelers fretting about fuel prices.
 Without such a rebate, said general manager Jennifer Messier, ''We're afraid that maybe they'll stay closer to home.''
 Booking two nights or more through Hotels.com qualifies consumers for a rebate of up to $30, with a gas receipt. The Six Flags amusement park chain will cut admission by $15 a person in exchange for a gas receipt.
 And reserving at least four nights at one of 43 hotels in Traverse City, Mich., earns a $25 gas card from the local visitors bureau. That amount is a small fraction of the a hotel bill, but officials attribute a significant number of bookings to the promotion.
 ''That $25 rebate probably gets their gas bill back to last year's prices,'' said Jack Schripsema, the visitors bureau's vice president for sales and marketing.
 Florida's tourism promotion department has assembled a feature on its Web site, VisitFlorida.com, that shows people where they can travel on a single tank of gas. Florida officials predict that despite high fuel prices, tourism will increase slightly over last year, when, they estimated, a record 85 million people visited the state. 
 ''Thirty or 50 dollars will not cause them to cancel their trips, but it will cause them to make choices,'' said Vanessa Welter, a spokeswoman for Visit Florida.
 A lucky few travelers are relatively immune to gas prices. On the St. Croix River in Hudson, Wis., where the air is full of white puff from the cottonwood trees, Bob Stanislaw readied his boat Friday for a race, with absolutely no plans to change his Memorial Day. His boat has sails.
 ''Wind power is the untapped resource,'' he said. ''It used to cost us $3 a year to run the boat. Now it costs $5.''

HEADLINE: The Manicure Menace

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES 

 BODY:
If you're fretting about immigrants stealing American jobs, I recommend going to Traci Harris for a manicure, complete with the soothing aromatic compresses. Her business is a case study of what happens to native workers when immigrants arrive.
 In theory, hordes of immigrants are a problem because they can take lots of jobs and drive down wages, especially for the less-educated natives in direct competition with them. 
In practice, though, that's not what economists find when they look at wages and unemployment rates in cities that attract large numbers of immigrants. Less-educated American workers in places like Los Angeles, Miami and New York don't seem to be substantially worse off than they are in cities with few immigrants. 
 Why not? One of the cleverest answers comes from an analysis of the nail-salon business in California. It makes an especially tidy case study because the state keeps track of all licensed manicurists, enabling economists to see what happened to American workers like Harris when tens of thousands of Vietnamese entered the business during the past two decades.
 Harris owns the Salon Legohn in Leimert Park, a working-class, predominantly black neighborhood in Los Angeles. As Vietnamese salons proliferated nearby, she couldn't compete with their low prices. But she has kept her salon in business -- and kept hiring Americans -- by concentrating on hairstyling.
 ''Women want a hairdresser who speaks English,'' Harris says. ''You don't face the same kind of competition from the Vietnamese.''
 Harris herself remained a manicurist, but not at her own salon. She has found more lucrative full-time jobs at beachfront hotel spas and as a freelancer on movie sets and at magazine photo shoots. Instead of competing with the Vietnamese in the neighborhood, she visits clients in Beverly Hills who pay $150 for a house call. 
 ''If you can speak English, it's easy to find a job at an elite shop,'' she says. ''American manicurists are a hot commodity. My clients want to have a conversation.''
 Harris's experience doesn't surprise Kathy Krynski of Kenyon College, one of the economists who analyzed the California manicure business. She, Maya Federman and David Harrington found that the surge in Vietnamese manicurists didn't suddenly put Americans out of work.
 Some Americans gave up their licenses, but the turnover wasn't much higher than it had been before the Vietnamese arrived. The chief effect of the competition was to discourage young Americans from entering the business, so over time the number of American manicurists dwindled.
 ''The Vietnamese didn't so much displace Americans as gradually replace them,'' Krynski says. ''Some Americans stayed in the business in upscale salons, and others probably went into other occupations offering higher wages, like being a hairdresser.''
 Some young Americans did lose the chance to become manicurists, but it's not as if every immigrant took an American's job. The study found that for every two fewer Americans in the business, there were five new Vietnamese manicurists. 
 Like other immigrants, Vietnamese nail-salon owners didn't simply fill existing jobs. They created more jobs that benefited American consumers. These entrepreneurs transformed the business not only with their workers but also with time-saving innovations like electric tools for shaping nails.
 As a result, shop clerks in Harris's neighborhood who used to go a couple of months between manicures can now afford weekly visits to Van's Salon. I got a manicure there from Nancy Nguyen for $8, a quarter of what I paid for the cheapest manicure available from Harris at the spa at Shutters on the Beach hotel.
 Nguyen couldn't compete with Harris in ambience or conversation -- I barely got her to utter her name. Harris spent half an hour working on my right hand, gently using compresses infused with tangerine and peppermint as well as a hazelnut and menthol scrub. Nguyen did my left hand in 10 minutes without explaining what she was doing. 
 To my inexpert eye -- this was my first manicure -- Harris did the better job, but the nails buffed by Nguyen certainly looked better than usual. If I wanted a weekly manicure, I'd be glad to have the cheaper Vietnamese option available.
 And I wouldn't worry about the economic menace of foreign manicurists. American workers have survived this immigrant invasion with their paychecks intact, and their fingernails in better shape than ever.

HEADLINE: Energy Shortage 

 BODY:
Sherwood Boehlert, the moderate Republican who will retire this fall, observed on the floor of the House last week that despite polls showing conservation as the ''preferred option'' among Americans worried about high gas prices and oil dependency, ''this Congress has not voted on a single conservation measure since gasoline hit $3 a gallon.'' At which point his colleagues voted (yet again) to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling in the misguided but apparently unshakable belief that a nation that uses one-quarter of the world's oil while possessing 3 percent of its reserves can drill its way to lower prices. 
 The legislative outlook is brighter in the Senate, which has before it the Enhanced Energy Security Act of 2006. The bill has impressive bipartisan sponsorship and incorporates the best features of an earlier (and more cumbersomely named) vehicle called the Vehicle and Fuel Choices for American Security Act. Its stated purpose is to reduce oil dependency, but the strategies and technologies it encourages would also do much to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
 The bill would require the president to figure out ways to cut oil consumption by 2.5 million barrels -- 12.5 percent of current use -- by 2016, and cut it in half by 2031. It offers a menu of loans, direct subsidies, tax breaks and other incentives that would encourage the production of fuel-efficient cars as well as gasoline alternatives like cellulosic ethanol. It does not mandate specific improvements in fuel economy standards -- a Congressional red flag -- yet the goal it sets would get us to the same place. 
 There is also real money here -- $1.8 billion for hybrid ''plug-in'' vehicles, for instance, $1 billion for cellulosic fuels. And while anything is possible in a Congress habituated to pork, the bill is not yet encumbered with the special favors and tax breaks for the oil and gas industry that have disfigured recent energy bills. It would, in fact, repeal some of those breaks in an effort to lessen its cost. 
 This is a relatively straightforward bill with big ambitions -- to reduce the demand for oil, thus reducing America's contribution to global warming while enhancing its national security. President Bush, who has made so much of the dependency issue without offering legislation of his own, would do the country a great favor by getting behind it.

DATELINE: SCHUYLKILL HAVEN, Pa. 

 BODY:
I SAT on my farmhouse's back step in the low light of dawn, watching two blackpoll warblers -- slim, streaky and hyperkinetic -- flit through the new leaves of the maples, which the sun turned into tiny lenses of green.
 My trees were a way station for these birds, moving between their winter home in South America and their destination to the north -- the boreal forest, the vast shield of spruce and aspen, of muskeg and marsh, that stretches from Newfoundland to western Alaska. Larger than even the Amazon, North America's boreal zone is one of the biggest intact ecosystems left on the planet, with 1.4 billion acres in Canada alone, most of it still in immense, interlocking tracts that make up a quarter of the earth's remaining original forest. 
With its southern fringe running just across the border from northern New England and the upper Great Lakes, the boreal forest is largely unknown to most people in the United States. Its most visible product, however, is now flooding our backyards with welcome color and song. The boreal forest is the continent's matchless bird nursery: some three billion individuals of nearly 300 species breed there, from trumpeter swans to delicate warblers, migrating across the entirety of the United States to return there. In autumn, they scatter to the farthest corners of the hemisphere, leading some scientists to suggest that the boreal has a greater global impact than perhaps any other single ecosystem. 
 Despite centuries of logging and development, most of the boreal is still intact. But over the next decade, timber, energy and mineral development will accelerate across the region, including a natural-gas pipeline through the heart of the Mackenzie Valley in the Northwest Territories that will speed the extraction of oil from the vast tar-sand deposits beneath Alberta's boreal forests.
 Because this region is so huge, though, we have a chance to get it right this time -- to upend the typical approach to conservation. Instead of protecting a few patches of natural habitat, we have the opportunity to save immense, functioning ecosystems as the matrix, with islands of carefully managed development in between.
 This isn't just a pipe dream. The Boreal Forest Conservation Framework, which calls for protecting fully half of Canada's forest while promoting sustainable development on the remainder, has attracted support from a remarkable array of traditional adversaries. These include territorial and provincial governments, Canadian Indian tribes, environmental groups like the World Wildlife Fund and the Nature Conservancy, and (most important) industrial giants like Suncor Energy and large paper companies like Domtar and Alberta-Pacific Forest Industries.
 One reason for this unusual degree of cooperation and farsightedness is simple self-interest. In the case of the Mackenzie pipeline, cooperation may finally lay to rest legal challenges by tribes that have stalled development for more than 30 years. In other cases, American consumers are helping to drive change. Most of the wood pulp from boreal forests, for example, goes into products like tissue paper, catalogs and half the newsprint sold in the United States; Canadian logging companies are signing on to the conservation framework to avoid growing pressure from environmental groups in this country. Tembec, a $4 billion forest products enterprise that was an original signatory for the framework, has pledged to bring all 40 million acres of its timberland into compliance with the development standards set by the international Forest Stewardship Council.
 Governments have also begun to recognize the economic importance of a vibrant, healthy boreal forest. A recent study found that the ecological benefits of Canada's boreal forest -- including clean water, carbon sequestration and pest control by migratory birds -- are worth more than $80 billion annually, two and a half times the extractive value of its resources.
 But there is much the Canadian government can still do to protect this incomparable region, in addition to supporting the goals of the boreal framework. It has yet to address the heavy environmental impacts of tar-sand extraction, which range from the strip-mining of immense areas to the use of staggering quantities of fresh water. In the Northwest Territories, one of the most pressing needs is to identify (with the help of the aboriginal groups there) and preserve significant swaths of the most critical natural areas in the Mackenzie Valley before the pipeline is routed and built. The time to draw up a workable -- and visionary -- plan to safeguard the boreal is now.
 Most Americans will never visit the boreal forest, never watch woodland caribou flow over the crest of a hill by the hundreds, never hear the howl of gray wolves echo through the conifers. But the boreal touches us every spring, as the birds it scatters to the world come back again. And if we're wise, we can ensure that it will always be so. Sitting on the porch, I realized the warblers had moved on. They were already feeling the boreal's timeless pull, tugging them north again.

HEADLINE: Poisonous Tree Frog Could Bring Wealth to Tribe in Brazilian Amazon

BYLINE: By PAULO PRADA

DATELINE: CAMPINAS INDIAN RESERVE, Brazil 

 BODY:
Fernando Katukina is chief of an indigenous tribe that lives largely without running water, electricity, or links to the world outside this remote corner of the western Amazon.
 But Chief Fernando says he possesses a treasure that could be at the cutting-edge of biotechnology. If a plan initiated by the chief is successful, his tribe's fortunes will be transformed by an asset he and the Brazilian government believe holds great promise for the global pharmaceutical industry: the slime from a poisonous tree frog.
Tribal shamans have used the slime as an ancestral remedy to treat illness, pain, even laziness. The crucial ingredients are compounds with anesthetic, tranquilizing and other medicinal properties. Scientists say the promise lies in isolating peptides from the frog's slime and then reproducing them for medicines to treat hypertension, strokes and other illnesses 
 Already, Chief Fernando has the full backing of Brazil's government, which sees the frog slime as a stepping stone to significantly advance its own research and development in pharmaceuticals. In particular, the scientific challenge of the frog, known locally as the kambo, will deepen Brazil's expertise in pharmacogenomics -- the combined use of genetics and pharmacology -- and it takes advantage of the traditional knowledge of indigenous people. 
 ''Traditional knowledge can help modern medicine and generate significant economic benefits, too,'' said Bruno Filizola, technical coordinator of the project and a biologist at the environment ministry in Brasilia, Brazil's capital.
 The indigenous dimension is also crucial because Brazil, like other developing nations, is trying to fight back against what it perceives as biopiracy, the theft of biological resources from the country's native habitats for commercial use. Though the project is still in its early stages, and many starts often prove false, teams of some 20 scientists are seeking initial financing of close to $1 million from more than a dozen local universities, state governments and federal agencies. 
 There is also a great deal more than naive hope at stake here. Brazilian scientists have already taught the country's farmers, who today are among the world's top exporters, to manipulate soils and alter crops once unsuited for the country's climate. Now many researchers believe science can turn Brazilian forests into working, productive laboratories. 
 ''Brazil has a large, growing and capable community of scientists keen to develop their own research and products,'' said Joshua Rosenthal, deputy director of a division for international training and research at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. 
 Moreover, Brazilian researchers have not forgotten the case of the jararaca, the Amazonian viper. The pharmaceutical giant Squibb used the snake's venom to develop captopril, a blood pressure medicine it began selling in 1975. Though available generically since 1996, the medicine at its commercial peak was the largest selling product for the company, now part of New York-based Bristol-Myers Squibb, grossing $1.6 billion in 1991.
 ''Because of past errors,'' reads a document from the Brazilian Environment Ministry, ''captopril is not Brazilian.''
 Though home to the world's largest rainforest and one of the most biodiverse ecosystems on the planet, Brazil traditionally has been slow to develop its so-called genetic patrimony -- the plants and animals within its territory and the potential they offer for profit. The Ministry document also laments Brazil's historical research lag and the consequent loss of billions in potential revenues from pharmaceuticals, agricultural products, and other commercial goods.
 An overview for the effort known as Project Kambo, written by a team of researchers at the Environment Ministry, says, ''The national genetic patrimony could be the key to Brazil's transformation in the global political and socio-economic context.'' 
 The effort comes as developing countries increasingly promote the idea of developing and commercializing their traditional medicines and local arts. And they are questioning the rights of foreigners to exploit their locally derived products. At a United Nations gathering in the southern Brazilian city of Curitiba last month, delegates from developing nations called for changes to international law that would allow governments to block -- or at least share profits from -- foreign patents on biological resources found in their territory.
 In December, at a World Trade Organization meeting in Hong Kong, India's trade minister told delegates that progress in global trade talks hinged on similar changes. 
 Private industry is wary. The road from research to finished product is long and costly. Rare is the compound, companies argue, that in unadulterated form would become the next wonder drug or other commercial bonanza.
 ''Developing nations should take a lead by working to develop their own resources -- not blocking the efforts of others to research and invest,'' said Alan Oxley, a former Australian trade ambassador who is now a consultant in Melbourne and runs a research institute funded in part by the U.S. pharmaceutical industry.
 Brazil aims to take a lead through the kambo. The project was launched last year after Marina Silva, Brazil's environment minister, received a letter from Fernando, the Katukina chief, denouncing the growing use of kambo poison by outsiders. Its perceived benefits in recent years fueled a pirate trade in the poison in cities across Brazil. 
 The poison could be dangerous if administered wrongly, Chief Fernando warned. And its use, the letter added, is nothing less than biopiracy; if economic gain is generated by the remedy, the Katukina tribe should get a cut.
 Ms. Silva, a native of the tribe's home state of Acre, agreed. She authorized a ministry project to study the kambo, stipulating that any profits derived from the research be shared with the Katukina. 
 ''The know-how is the tribe's,'' she said in a recent telephone interview. ''They must share in any rewards.'' 
 Scientists have studied the kambo before. Called the giant monkey frog in English, because it climbs high into the rainforest canopy, the kambo first sparked attention among foreign researchers decades ago. Some of the compounds from the poison, secreted through the frog's skin, have even been patented abroad. 
 Yet because scientists are still struggling to understand the poison, none of those patents have led to successful products. ''These compounds have potent effects on human physiology,'' said Paul Bishop, a biochemist at ZymoGenetics, a Seattle-based pharmaceutical company, and the author of five patents based on kambo poison. ''But we don't fully understand them all or just why they occur in the defenses of this tree frog.'' 
 That is where Brazil hopes to excel. While biologists and chemists investigate the kambo, its habitat and the poison's makeup, a team of anthropologists and physicians will study the long-term impact of its use on the Katukina.
 One morning in mid-March, two scientists from the Federal University of Acre visited the tribe's reserve, a 125-square mile section of jungle near the Peruvian border. There, amid one of five clusters of wooden cabins, two shamans agreed to administer the kambo remedy, known in Portuguese as the ''vacina do sapo,'' or ''frog vaccine.''
 Reginaldo Machado, a biologist, stood shirtless and sweating next to an older shaman, who touched the red-hot end of a burning twig three times to the scientist's shoulder. The other shaman, another twig in hand, then daubed the sticky, mud-like poison on each of the tiny burns.
 Mr. Machado, already in pain from a flare-up of chronic kidney stones, within seconds sprang from the wooden shack, suffering hot flashes, nausea, and stomach aches. Ten minutes later, he returned, expressing surprise. 
 ''I actually do feel stronger,'' he said. ''There's more to this than myth.''
 Though western dress long ago replaced the grass skirts traditionally worn by tribal people, the frog remedy is one of a handful of customs the Katukina preserve. 
 After catching the frog in nearby trees, tribe members tie it spread-eagle style between two posts, collecting slime from its back and sides with a piece of wood, where it dries. They then release the frog and later, with water or saliva, re-hydrate the dried poison before applying it.
 Despite the term ''vaccine,'' the slime does not vaccinate against any specific germ or illness. 
 Once the body processes the poison's toxins -- hence Mr. Machado's sweats and indigestion -- its compounds induce what users say is a prolonged sense of alertness and wellbeing. Because they believe it heightens their senses, Katukina hunters traditionally use it most: Long rows of burn scars dot their arms, chests and stomachs. 
 Most Katukina speak only the tribal variant of pano, a native Amazonian language group. Fernando, one of only two tribe members to work outside the reserve, is convinced of the kambo's value, and adamant that the medication, if used by others, can improve a tribal economy that is currently at the level of subsistence.
 ''The vaccine belongs to us,'' he said. ''Science might help us develop it, but kambo knowledge is Katukina.''

HEADLINE: China Begins Effort to Curb Piracy of Computer Software

BYLINE: By DAVID LAGUE; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: BEIJING, May 29 

 BODY:
When Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, played host to President Hu Jintao of China in Seattle last month, he learned that he had a customer at the apex of the world's biggest market.
 In a conversation with Mr. Gates, President Hu volunteered that the computer he used in his Beijing office was loaded with the Windows operating system, according to two senior Chinese-born Microsoft executives, Zhang Yaqin and Harry Shum, who escorted the Chinese leader during the visit.
 ''Bill said: 'If you need any advice using Windows, I would be happy to help,' '' Mr. Zhang said in an interview in Beijing. 
 It is probably not every day that Mr. Gates offers Windows users personal technical support. However, with piracy rampant in China, Microsoft and other software companies have every incentive to seek the good will of the country's top leaders.
 Their efforts appear to be having some effect. Responding to years of intensive international lobbying, the Chinese government recently introduced a range of measures that have the potential to curb widespread piracy and increase revenue for software companies.
 The Business Software Alliance, a software industry lobby group based in Washington, estimates that more than 90 percent of the software used in China is unlicensed.
 On March 31, Beijing announced that local computer makers must ship all their products with licensed operating systems pre-installed. The government has also started a drive to ensure that all computers in the country's sprawling bureaucracy are loaded with legitimate software.
 ''It is indeed good news, marking a clear step in the right direction to reverse the serious problem of software piracy that frustrates the development in China for both foreign and domestic vendors,'' said Gregory Shea, the Beijing-based president of the United States Industry Technology Office, which represents more than 6,000 technology companies.
 Senior Chinese officials acknowledge that software piracy is widespread, though they argue that foreign critics, including the Business Software Alliance, vastly exaggerate the scale of the problem.
 Washington intensified pressure on the Chinese government ahead of President Hu's visit to the United States to protect the property rights of software companies.
 One of the complaints of the Bush administration is that intellectual property theft contributes to the soaring United States trade deficit with China. On a visit to Beijing in March, the American secretary of commerce, Carlos M. Gutierrez, noted that China ranked second in the world for computer sales but only 25th for software.
 ''We believe that is an indication of the use of pirated software,'' he said.
 After Beijing's decision to compel computer makers to install licensed operating system software, Microsoft signed licensing deals with the leading Chinese computer manufacturers Lenovo, the TCL Group, Tsinghua Tongfang and the Founder Technology Group.
 Lenovo, the maker of personal computers, agreed to spend $1.2 billion on Windows software over the next 12 months.
 Senior Microsoft executives described the licensing deals as a breakthrough in the company's 14-year presence in China, although analysts said it seemed that a significant amount of the licensing revenue would come from computers made for export.
 In an April 17 statement announcing the agreement with Lenovo, Microsoft said the $1.2 billion in license fees would pay for software loaded in computers the Chinese company shipped to 65 countries and territories.
 Lenovo made about a third of the almost 20 million personal computers sold in China last year, according to industry estimates. Sales figures compiled by industry research groups suggest it is on track to sell more than twice that amount to foreign customers this year.
 Some experts doubt that the pre-installation requirement will lead to a sharp increase in legitimate software sales in China, a market where computer sales soared 29 percent in 2005, according to the technology research firm Gartner.
 Those experts point out that China has made promises in the past to crack down on software piracy without any noticeable effect.
 ''There will still be piracy for a considerable period of time,'' said Michael Chen, the Beijing-based general manager for Red Hat, a leading supplier of open-source software. ''People's buying behavior is slow to change.''
 Chen and other experts maintain that the relatively high prices charged for licensed software to Chinese customers, who have relatively low incomes by Western standards, are part of the reason for China's high piracy rates.
 Before the new regulation, most personal computers sold in China were sold without any operating system or loaded with DOS, an early operating system that preceded Windows. Some were sold with versions of Linux open-source software pre-installed. Up to 90 percent of customers then loaded pirated copies of Windows that sell for about 10 yuan, or $1.23, according to computer industry analysts. A legitimate copy of Windows purchased separately costs about 600 yuan.
 Industry experts estimate that Microsoft sells licensed copies of Windows XP to Chinese computer makers at a heavy discount, which would add up to 300 yuan to the cost of a 6,000-yuan desktop PC sold without an operating system.
 Some analysts suggest that the new rules will simply swell the number of computers loaded with Linux. The Chinese government has strongly encouraged the use of this open-source software to minimize the country's dependence on expensive software supplied under license from companies like Microsoft.
 ''It could open up a whole new area for companies supporting open-source software to make their technology known,'' Mr. Chen said.
 Even with a sharp reduction in theft of operating systems, experts say the effect on overall piracy will be limited. They say the illegitimate copying of other software is estimated to account for the majority of piracy in China.
 The Business Software Alliance, however, calculates that even a relatively small decline in piracy will deliver a windfall for China and the software industry. A joint study between the alliance and IDC, a market intelligence group, published late last year said that a drop of 10 percentage points in software piracy from 90 percent would increase the Chinese economy by $87 billion and lead to an extra 1.8 million jobs in information technology.
 The study also said that a reduction of piracy on this scale would lift local industry revenue by $67 billion and allow the government to collect an extra $6.5 billion in tax. Some industry experts maintain that legitimate pre-installed software will be attractive to some Chinese computer buyers. Mr. Shea said he had received reports of increased sales from vendors offering computers with licensed operating systems.
 ''If the government is committed to buying legitimate software, it sets the tone for the country,'' said Arthur Kobler, a business consultant based in Hong Kong and a former president of AT&T in China.

 BODY:

OFFER FOR KINDER MORGAN -- A group led by Richard D. Kinder announced a buyout offer valued at $22 billion for Kinder Morgan Inc., the parent of the pipeline giant he founded in 1997. The deal, which includes the assumption of about $8 billion in debt, would be the largest leveraged buyout since Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Company bought RJR Nabisco in 1989 for $25 billion. [Page C1.] 


TWO IN NEWS CREW KILLED -- Two Britons working as members of a CBS News television crew were killed on Monday and an American correspondent for the network, Kimberly Dozier, was critically wounded when a military patrol they were accompanying was hit by a roadside bomb. [A1.]

THE BATTLE FOR AIR -- Americans are increasingly recognizing that the effects of carbon emissions on global warming are a serious problem, but there are no rules in the United States regulating heat-trapping gases comparable to those that most other developed countries have adopted under the Kyoto Protocol. Some United States businesses, though, are responding for a variety of reasons anyway: to satisfy customers or shareholders who worry about the environment, to improve their public image or to drive down their energy costs. In addition, some states and local authorities have stepped in to try to curb their contributions to global warming. [C1.]

A STEEL WAR -- When it came to repelling a hostile takeover bid from Mittal Steel, Arcelor left no stone unturned as it searched for a poison-pill partner. But some critics say that the solution -- a deal that gives more than a third of Arcelor to a Russian billionaire, Aleksei Mordashov, left, may leave a bitter aftertaste. If it is approved by the shareholders, the agreement will put Russian executives in crucial management positions at Arcelor, raising questions about integration between the two corporate cultures, and concerns among some shareholders about what role the Russian government may want to play. [C3.]

HISPANIC CALLERS -- Now that nearly three out of four people in this country have mobile phone service, cellphone companies are chasing new customers by marketing to ever more specific slices of the population. But one group is getting extra attention: Hispanics. And there is ample reason for the carriers' attention. One of the country's fastest growing demographic groups, Hispanics often have large families that span international borders, making for larger phone bills. [C1.]

THAT 60'S SHOW -- AMC cable television network is considering a series that would explore how Madison Avenue remakes itself to meet the changing needs of clients as consumers and the media undergo transformation. So the show would be a reality series, right? Not exactly. It is fictional, a drama about the advertising industry circa 1960. In another example of how the more things change the more they remain the same, if AMC decides to pick up the series, each episode may be sponsored by a single advertiser -- just as was done in 1960. Stuart Elliott, Advertising. [C7.]

A SUMMER OF HIGH GAS PRICES -- As the summer travel season began in earnest this past weekend, Americans were indulging their wanderlust, jamming highways, and filling airports, motels and eateries. But in some small ways, with possibly large consequences for the health of the economy, travelers interviewed across the country over the weekend said they were cutting their spending and downsizing their plans for summer trips. [A1.]

A MOVE IN EUROPE -- When BAE Systems, the British military contractor, announced that it was bowing out of its nearly 30-year relationship with Airbus, the split was greeted in Britain with shock at first, followed by recognition that the companies had grown apart. BAE's departure now could be transformational not only for it, but also for Airbus, whose ownership -- and decision-making -- structure is evolving. [C4.]

BRIGHT SPOT FOR G.M. -- Four years ago, Daewoo Motor was the biggest and ugliest addition to South Korea's junkyard of bankrupt companies. Its parent conglomerate had collapsed, and most potential investors were intimidated by its militant labor union. Its founder, Kim Woo Choong, left, is on trial on corruption charges linked to the disintegration of his conglomerate in 1998. But Mr. Kim is gone, and Daewoo has become a bright spot for G.M. [C4.]

AIRLINE APOLOGIZES -- WestJet Airlines agreed on Monday to pay 15.5 million Canadian dollars ($14 million) to settle accusations of spying on an internal Web site of its rival, Air Canada. The settlement, which came with an apology, brought to an end two years of litigation. [C9.]

THE OPEC MEETING -- Most delegates at this week's meeting of OPEC are expected to nod politely to Venezuela's calls for output cuts that could drive prices even higher, while doing the opposite by reaping all they can from the current bonanza of high prices. The oil minister of the United Arab Emirates rejected talk of a possible cut in the cartel's output quotas of 28 million barrels a day. [C1.]

A SOFTWARE BATTLE IN CHINA -- Responding to years of intensive international lobbying, the Chinese government has introduced measures offering the potential to curb widespread piracy and increase revenue for software companies. The Business Software Alliance estimates that more than 90 percent of the software in China is unlicensed. [C3.]

A NEW TAX COMPLAINT -- In an effort to raise revenues, tax writers in Congress added a last-minute provision that increased taxes for Americans living abroad. But the sudden imposition of taxes has surprised overseas taxpayers, and it has employers concerned about the added cost. [C3.]

PAYING WITH ATTENTION -- With the cost of mobile phone calls already dropping sharply, Virgin Mobile USA plans to announce a way that people can talk for no money at all. They will, however, have to pay with a chunk of their attention. [C4.]

FROG POWER -- A tribal cure in Brazil, derived from the secretions of a poisonous tree frog, raises hope of a wonder drug that might benefit the country's indigenous people as well as its drug industry [C1.]

GLOBAL SECURITY -- In an increasingly global economy, more business travelers find themselves visiting places that, if not as obviously dangerous as Baghdad or Kabul, are unfamiliar and possibly treacherous. And a number of risk management and security firms are providing services to help them, and say their business is growing. [C8.]

HEADLINE: In Separation From Airbus, BAE Refocuses on Military

BYLINE: By NICOLA CLARK; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: PARIS, May 29 

 BODY:
When BAE Systems, the British military contractor, announced last month that it was bowing out of its nearly 30-year relationship with Airbus, the split was greeted in Britain with shock, followed by nods of recognition of the kind that sometimes come when a long-married couple confide that they have grown apart. 
 The British, after all, had been lukewarm about the European commercial aircraft venture almost from the beginning. Britain entered talks in the mid-1960's on joining the French-German consortium, but ultimately backed out in 1969 when the supersonic Concorde -- which received more than $:1 billion, or $1.87 billion, in British state aid -- attracted only a handful of orders. A full decade passed before BAE Systems, then a state-owned company, joined Airbus, in 1979.
 By a number of measures, the collaboration was a success, lifting Europe's share of the world commercial aircraft market to about 50 percent from 10 percent in the 1970's, making it a fierce rival to Boeing. Airbus -- now controlled by European Aeronautic Defense and Space -- has spawned a series of highly successful airplanes like the A320 and A340. This year, it will deliver the first A380 superjumbo -- the world's largest passenger plane. And Airbus has generated consistent profits for its stakeholders. 
 BAE's departure now could be transformational not only for it, but also for Airbus, whose ownership -- and decision-making -- structure is evolving. 
 BAE has never really seen itself as a builder of passenger planes. When Airbus was transformed into a corporation in 2000, BAE made clear that its interest in the company was financial and not strategic: The terms included an option for BAE to sell its 20 percent stake back to EADS, which owns the other 80 percent. 
 ''The fact that BAE is selling its stake should not come as a surprise,'' Gustav Humbert, the chief executive of Airbus, said earlier this month. ''This is a business decision, not an industrial one.'' 
 Commercial aerospace represented only about a fifth of the nearly $:15 billion in sales that BAE reported in 2005, and about 15 percent of operating profit. 
 Still, divorce -- even an amicable one -- does not always go smoothly. 
 ''Flying in the face of reason,'' read a headline on the opinion page of The Observer, which described BAE's sale of its Airbus stake as both ''reckless'' and ''disastrous'' for BAE's employees and shareholders. Brendan Barber, leader of Britain's Trades Union Congress, told The Mirror: ''It smacks of the short-termism that cripples U.K. industry.'' 
 Analysts said the emotional public reaction was natural, though not particularly justified. 
 ''A lot of the objection is more about national sentiment and pride than cold economic logic,'' said Richard Aboulafia of the Teal Group, a consulting group in Fairfax, Va. 
 In fact, ever since its privatization in 1981, BAE has focused increasingly on securing business from two of the world's top-spending militaries: those of Saudi Arabia and the United States. 
 In the 1980's, the government of Saudi Arabia -- flush with petrodollars -- became BAE's first major international customer, outfitting its air force with fighter jets and pilot training systems. Though the value of the Saudi contracts was never publicly disclosed, analysts estimate they have generated at least $60 billion in revenue over the last two decades. 
 ''This has been a major backbone for BAE and an important source of cash flows that took them through some very difficult times,'' said Tony Edwards, chairman of the Air League, a British aviation industry lobbying group and a former head of the military exports arm of the British government. 
 Despite those lucrative deals, however, BAE struggled throughout most of the 1990's. Major contracts with the British Navy, including a $:2 billion Astute submarine order and another $:2 billion sale of Nimrod maritime patrol jets, ran into huge cost overruns that at one point threatened the company's survival. Relations between BAE and the British government were poisoned for years and gave further impetus to BAE's push to diversify its client base. 
 ''BAE were determined not to take on the kind of risks with the Ministry of Defense as they had in the past,'' Mr. Edwards said. 
 In 1999, BAE Systems acquired the Marconi electronics business of GEC Marconi, which had well-established contacts with the Pentagon. The deal was soon followed by other strategic acquisitions in the United States. Today, BAE is a significant military contractor in the United States, with roughly a third of its $:59.8 billion in orders coming from North America. 
 ''Even though they are undoubtedly the national defense champion of the U.K., BAE in the United States is very much thought of as an American company,'' said Alex Ashbourne of Ashbourne Strategic Consulting in London. 
 BAE's American face gives it a distinct edge compared with its European rivals in the post-9/11 world, where ''Buy American'' has largely become the byword when awarding government contracts, especially in the sensitive areas of national security and defense. 
 Its United States subsidiary, BAE Systems, is run by an American, Mark Ronald, and its board includes Washington heavyweights like Lee Hamilton, a former congressman; Anthony Zinni, a retired Marine general; and Richard Kerr, a former deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency. 
 ''The other European companies like EADS and Thales are all trying to do the same thing,'' Mr. Ashbourne said. ''The others no doubt look at BAE with envy.'' 
 Given the magnitude of the Pentagon's budget -- roughly $500 billion in 2005 -- it is easy to see why. That's more than double the $230 billion that the 25 members of the European Union collectively spend on the military every year. Washington earmarked $100 billion for new equipment spending last year -- 10 times the procurement budget of Britain's Ministry of Defense. 
 In addition, the European military market remains fragmented and highly protected, making economies of scale difficult to achieve. Last week, 22 E.U. members signed a voluntary code of conduct aimed at making bids for military contracts more open. But for giants like BAE, such steps are too incremental. 
 ''It might have been different 10 years ago,'' Mr. Aboulafia of the Teal Group said. ''But if you are a defense company these days, you know where the action is.'' 
 According to BAE, United States military priorities for the next several years are likely to involve substantial commitments to supporting operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as investment in new communications and surveillance technologies -- areas where BAE excels. And despite growing public unease over the United States presence in Iraq, analysts say there is still a willingness in Washington to spend generously on national security. 
 ''There is broad support for high levels of defense spending on both sides of the political aisle,'' said Mr. Aboulafia, who noted that Howard Dean, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee and a former presidential candidate, had once said he would be prepared to spend $400 billion annually on defense. While that would represent a 20 percent cut from current spending levels, it is still almost double the amount of current European spending on defense. 
 Meanwhile, lawyers for BAE and EADS are negotiating the sale price for the British group's Airbus stake. Analysts have said a deal, expected bythe end of June, could net BAE anywhere from 3.5 billion to 6 billion euros, or as much as $7.64 billion, thanks to good timing. 
 ''This gives them options'' to expand through acquisitions, Mr. Edwards said. 
 Analysts also believe Airbus, which secured a record 1,055 aircraft orders in 2005, is reaching a short-term peak in value, before entering into a period of heavy investments in new airplanes -- not to mention a potentially costly overhaul of the slow-selling A350. ''They're taking advantage of this peak in value to get some cash,'' Mr. Edwards said.

HEADLINE: Have Danger, Will Advise 

BYLINE: By SARA J. WELCH

 BODY:
Three years ago, Christopher Exline, a Dallas businessman, decided to open a branch of his furniture-rental company in Baghdad after he saw all the looting there on TV. 
 ''I witnessed all of these liberated Iraqis embarking on their own redecorating schemes by looting the palace and office buildings,'' said Mr. Exline, who is chief executive officer of Home Essentials, which leases furniture to employees of government agencies and private companies in Iraq. ''I realized that any good furniture that did exist was now gone.''
Since then, Mr. Exline has expanded his company into Kabul, Afghanistan, and recently decided to open a showroom in Tripoli, Libya. ''I don't perceive this as risky,'' he said. ''Entrepreneurs define risk differently than other people.'' 
 Even so, most businesspeople would probably avoid an itinerary like Mr. Exline's. But in an increasingly global economy, more business travelers find themselves visiting places that, if not as obviously dangerous as Baghdad or Kabul, are unfamiliar and possibly treacherous. And a number of risk management and security firms are providing services to help them, and say their business is growing. 
 The security services industry has been growing by about 10 to 12 percent annually since 9/11, said Joseph Ricci, executive director of the National Association of Security Companies.
 For example, iJET Intelligent Risk Systems sends out daily ''intelligence briefings'' on global hot spots for more than 400 clients, including the World Bank, Archer Daniels Midland, the multinational agricultural company, and Booz Allen Hamilton, the management consulting firm.' 
 From iJET's operations center in Annapolis, Md., which has been open around the clock since it began in April 2001, the company's 30 analysts -- many of whom are former military intelligence officers -- continuously monitor developments in 183 countries from experts and other sources. iJET said it had more than 350 corporate clients today. In September 2001, iJET had just six.
 The company's services include a real-time employee-tracking system called Worldcue for clients who want to know where their employees are at any time and how to contact them. On Sept. 11, 2001, Archer Daniels used this technology to locate all 450 of its employees who were traveling abroad in only two hours. 
 More recently, when prison riots erupted in Sao Paulo, Brazil, iJET's clients were able to locate 620 employees who were in the area and advise them on how to handle the situation, the company said. 
 For executives who want more hands-on training, Kroll -- a subsidiary of Marsh, the risk management firm based in New York City -- runs programs in travel safety and security. Those range from a four-hour seminar on avoiding risk in foreign cities, to weapons instruction. 
 For executives traveling to particularly dangerous regions, Kroll can provide a security detail of up to 10 bodyguards, with guns and armored vehicles, for about $10,000 a day. ''We do that every day in Baghdad and pretty much every day in Kabul,'' said Jack Stradley, an official with Kroll's security group. 
 Mr. Exline of Home Essentials said that he rarely visited his Baghdad office now because of safety concerns. ''I used to walk the streets there a year and a half ago, but you can't do that anymore,'' he said. ''But when I'm in Kabul, I go out to dinner with my staff and with customers, and I don't have armed security.'' 
 Mr. Exline added that he did not carry any type of special risk insurance when he traveled, even though the managing director of his Baghdad office was kidnapped recently (he was returned unharmed). 
 However, Mr. Stradley of Kroll said most companies that carried what is known as kidnap and ransom insurance were not allowed -- according to the terms of the policy -- to even acknowledge that they carried it. ''There's a danger in making it known that you're an employee of a large company because odds are you have such insurance, which means that if you're kidnapped, the kidnappers will get paid,'' he said. 
 There are less expensive alternatives to intelligence services provided by companies like iJET or International SOS, based in Philadelphia.
 Some Web sites are helpful, said Michael McCann, former head of security for the United Nations and now chief executive officer of McCann Protective Services in New York City. 
 He recommends the CIA's World Factbook (www.odci.gov/cia/publications) and the Web site of the Overseas Security Advisory Council (www.ds-osac.org/), a public-private partnership maintained by the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and the Department of State. 
 The State Department's Web site at travel.state.gov offers general information, including current travel warnings, and the department encourages Americans traveling abroad to register with the local U.S. consulate or embassy, either in person or online at travelregistration.state.gov/ibrs/. 
 Travelers should also do general Internet searches to find out if there are any strikes, riots, or other disruptions in the cities they are traveling to, said Mr. McCann. ''There's so much on the Web these days that's current, it puts guys like me out of business,'' he said. 
 But Mr. Exline said that he preferred to rely on word-of-mouth for his information. ''I made sure I knew multiple people of various backgrounds in those markets before I went in,'' he said, speaking of his decision to open his business in Baghdad and Kabul. ''I've just found that by talking to people I know and people who know people I know, I can get a lot more data in a shorter period of time.''

HEADLINE: At 6-foot-11 With Bad Ankles, He Wants an Aisle Seat

BYLINE: By Bill Walton; As told to Christopher Elliott.

 BODY:
I'm 6-foot, 11-inches tall -- not the tallest guy to have played in the N.B.A., but I still tower over the average traveler. I'm on the road about 200 days a year, trying to contend with airline seats and hotel rooms that, to be honest, were not built with professional basketball players in mind.
 Don't get me wrong: I love to travel, especially during the N.B.A. playoffs. 
I started flying regularly when I joined the circus that is basketball while I was playing at U.C.L.A. in 1970. I wasn't a stranger to air travel. As a teenager, I bought one of those weekend passes on the old P.S.A. that let you fly anywhere in its network for a few bucks, and we followed the Grateful Dead around California.
 When I fly now, I have to be careful not just about the airline I choose, but also the aircraft type. I like an airline with a positive attitude. On domestic flights, I'm a card-carrying Southwest Airlines frequent flier -- I love their spirit and their service. I also get the seat that I absolutely must have in order to be comfortable: The right-side, aisle seat. No bulkhead.
 I've had 32 operations on my legs, and the ankles in both legs are fused together. My left leg got it the worst, and when I fly, it has to be stretched out. The flight attendants see me coming, and they know me. I can almost hear them say, ''Oh no, not him again. The tall guy with the aisle seat. Hot water and orange juice.''
 And yes, I've had a few run-ins with the beverage cart. The attendants try not to hit the leg.
 On longer flights, it's all about the plane. The best aircraft for me is the Boeing 777, a long-range, wide-body jet that is used on a lot of international routes. I find that it has the most room. I also like the Boeing 767, followed by the 757. 
 The most difficult, for a tall guy, is the MD-80. They're so small that I can't stand up in them. When you fly somewhere and you're not sure what kind of airplane you're going to be in, you find yourself asking questions like: ''Will I be able to stand up on this flight? Will I be able to fit into the restroom?''
 Hotels can be a challenge, too. You ask for the biggest bed that they have, and you sleep corner-to-corner. And no matter what, you hang off the side of the mattress. Sometimes, the ceilings in a hotel are so low that you can't stand up. 
 You would think that's the worst thing that could happen to you, but there is one thing that tops it. And that is being handed the keys to a smoking room. The moment you walk through the door, you smell it. You can't breathe. You can almost feel it taking years off your life. It pays to have a good travel agent who can make absolutely sure you get the room and flight you need every time.
 I'm not one to complain, though. There are a lot of people who have more serious troubles than I do. When I have to find a place for my left leg, I consider myself lucky that I can still use my legs. And when I'm trying to squeeze myself into an economy class seat, I wonder how people like Yao Ming of the Houston Rockets manage to travel. 
 I only come up to his shoulders.

HEADLINE: MEMO PAD

BYLINE: By JOE SHARKEY

 BODY:

A TASTE OF SUMMER -- By tomorrow, the end of the Memorial Day holiday period, United States airlines will have carried 21 million passengers domestically and internationally since May 22, which the travel industry defines as the start of the holiday. The passenger count, an estimate from the Air Transport Association, will be almost 2 percent higher than last year's Memorial Day traffic record, mostly because of higher demand for international travel, the trade group says. The Transportation Security Administration, meanwhile, says it is gearing up to process a record 200 million air passengers during the peak summer travel season through Labor Day. 


HOTEL BOTTOM LINES -- Last year was the most profitable ever for the domestic hotel industry, says Smith Travel Research. The industry had $122.7 billion in revenue and $22.6 billion in profit in 2005, slightly higher than the previous record in 2000. But a research report issued last week by PKF Hospitality Research raises a caution flag. ''Expenses continue at a level more than twice that of inflation, causing concern for hotel owners and operators,'' PKF says.

ONLINE IN THE LIMO -- LimoLiner, which operates 28-seat luxury shuttle vans between New York and Boston, said it had upgraded free onboard high-speed wireless systems on its fleet to provide connectivity at 700 kilobits a second. The connection is continuous, says the company, which charges $79 each way for the four-hour trip.

CONTINENTAL NO. 4 -- Based on passenger traffic through the end of April, Continental Airlines surpassed Northwest Airlines to become the fourth-largest domestic carrier. Continental reported 24.6 billion revenue passenger miles -- representing one paying passenger flown one mile -- through April 30, a 12.8 percent increase over the same period last year. Northwest, long the No. 4 airline, had 23 billion revenue passenger miles, a decrease of 6.2 percent.

ET CETERA -- To promote its revamped Web site, Frontier Airlines is offering double miles and free DirectTV (a 24-channel video service that usually costs $5) to customers who book on the site, Frontierairlines.com. Frontier says it hopes the new site will increase Web bookings by 40 percent in the next year, yielding significant savings in its distribution costs. Frequent flier miles earned through credit-card partnerships, rather than by flying, now account for 60 percent of the miles accrued in major airline frequent flier programs, a new study by IdeaWorks says. United Airlines says it expects to begin offering nonstop service to Kuwait from its hub at Washington-Dulles International Airport three times a week. It starts in late October, says United, which plans to operate the service with a Boeing 777 configured with 10 first-class, 45 business-class, 84 ''economy plus'' and 114 coach seats. JOE SHARKEY

HEADLINE: Americans Living Abroad Get a Nasty Tax Surprise

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER and DAVID CAY JOHNSTON; Keith Bradsher reported for this article from Hong Kong and David Cay Johnston from Rochester.

DATELINE: HONG KONG, May 29 

 BODY:
In an effort to raise revenues, tax writers in Congress added a last-minute provision that retroactively increased taxes for Americans living abroad. But the sudden imposition of new taxes has surprised overseas taxpayers, and it has employers concerned about the added cost. 
 The increase for Americans abroad was added at the last minute to the $69 billion tax cut legislation that was signed last week. Americans living overseas paid almost $3.5 billion in United States income taxes in 2001, the latest year for which data is available, according to the Internal Revenue Service.
The change, which is retroactive to the beginning of 2006, is expected to raise taxes on Americans abroad by $2.1 billion over the next 10 years.
 The suddenness of the move meant that American Chambers of Commerce in Asia did not have a chance to mobilize against the idea as they had in previous sessions of Congress. 
 ''We were held back by the U.S. Chamber because they didn't think it would be popped in this time,'' said Richard R. Vuylsteke, the executive director of the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei.
 Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, the chairman of the Finance Committee, who has long been a proponent of higher taxes on overseas Americans, has said that the tax policy had been overly generous. 
 Americans living overseas say the provision wrongly focuses on allowances that their employers pay to cover higher costs -- like housing, schools and trips home -- that they incur by taking a job abroad. The law changes the way taxes are calculated on subsidies like housing allowances, which should push many of those Americans into higher tax brackets, analysts say.
 While the move will have limited effect on Americans living in countries with high tax rates -- European countries, for example -- those living in low tax jurisdictions with high housing costs -- like Bermuda, the Middle East, Singapore and Hong Kong -- will be hit hardest, partners at two major accounting firms said. 
 Over all, the bill raises taxes on overseas Americans by about 6 percent, but most individuals will pay nothing more, while others will see their taxes quadruple.
 For Kristine Kraabel, a gift shop owner in Singapore, and her husband, who is now the regional human resources director there for an American company, the new legislation will more than triple their American tax bill. Their tax adviser calculates that they will owe $20,000 to $25,000 more in United States taxes, up from $5,000 last year, even as they pay $20,000 in Singapore taxes.
 Americans working overseas get a dollar-for-dollar credit for income taxes paid to foreign countries to offset their American income taxes. They also get to exclude $80,000 from the income they report to the I.R.S. The new law increased the exclusion to $82,400 this year. 
 But analyses by the accounting firms Ernst & Young and PricewaterhouseCoopers show that by adding provisions to how the exclusion is calculated, it raises the overall tax bill and marginal tax rates as well for some overseas Americans. 
 Senator Grassley's staff, in a memo, said that the I.R.S. counted 306,393 tax returns claiming the exclusion in 2003, of which only 125,894 paid any American income taxes. When no tax is due it means that foreign income taxes paid by overseas Americans, together with the benefit from excluding $80,000, were higher than those that would be owed to the United States alone.
 Michael Abdalian, a tax partner at Ernst & Young, said he has spoken to many employers about the increased tax burden. ''Most companies have programs designed to protect their employees from additional taxes,'' he said, so the expense will likely be borne by employers.
 Paying the higher taxes and then the taxes on the higher income to cover the taxes is a costly proposition, Mr. Abdalian said. Because the new rules will push many Americans overseas into higher brackets he said many companies will spend $2 for each $1 their overseas employees pay in taxes. The entire $2 will be deductible by the corporation.
 He said rough calculations showed that a married couple paid $300,000, of which $20,000 was a housing allowance, would see their income tax bill rise by about $20,000 and their employer's cost by about $40,000. Most countries exempt their citizens overseas from income taxes, so the law will give companies an incentive to hire Australians, Britons, Canadians and other nationalities for whom they do not have to pay additional taxes.
 The Kraabels, who own the Singapore gift shop, are especially upset because they used to live in Decorah, Iowa -- Senator Grassley's home state -- and still own a house there.
 In a furious letter to Senator Grassley, widely circulated among expatriates, Ms. Kraabel contended that overseas Americans subsidize their countrymen in the United States by helping to pay for services they never use. 
 ''You will be hard pressed to find us on federal roads, state roads, county roads, or even to find us on the ruins of Decorah's old green bridge,'' she wrote. ''We are your subsidy. We are your constituents, whose interests you condemn and refuse to represent.''
 Senator Grassley has long attacked the tax break for overseas Americans as an overly generous subsidy that does little to improve the American economy. Because the tax is retroactive many families are just starting to realize that they did not have employers withhold enough tax from their paychecks for the first five months of the year. Many employers will have to adjust their budgets if they plan to make their overseas workers whole, cutting into capital available for investment.
 Senator Grassley's staff said complaints about retroactive tax increases lacked merit because only one estimated tax payment was due before the law was enacted in May. 
 Jack Whiteford, a regional sales manager in Taipei, Taiwan, said he was worried that his employer, whom he declined to identify, might not indemnify him against the much higher taxes he will face under the new law, making it far less attractive for him to stay overseas. ''It's pulling money out of all of our pockets,'' he said.
 Mr. Whiteford's three children would go to public school tuition-free if he were in the United States, he said. But in Taiwan they attend a private, English-language school for which his employer pays $45,000 a year -- payments on which Mr. Whiteford will now owe higher taxes.
 His employer also pays for business-class tickets for the family to fly back to the United States once a year, and heavily subsidizes his rent, which is higher than it would be for comparable quarters in the United States. The $82,400 exclusion ''hardly covers the extra costs I incur'' by living overseas, Mr. Whiteford said.
 Increasing taxes on overseas Americans was cited in a report last year by the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation on tax reform and improving compliance, the staff noted, adding that it ''has been in the works for at least several years'' and should not have been a surprise. 
 In addition, analysts said the law did nothing about the hundreds of thousands of Americans living overseas who have illegally stopped paying income taxes.

HEADLINE: An Autopsy Of Katrina: Four Storms, Not Just One

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Most people believe that a single Category 3 hurricane, Katrina, devastated New Orleans on Aug. 29 of last year. The flood protection system for the New Orleans area was designed to protect the city from a direct hit by a fast-moving Category 3 storm. 
 Yet Hurricane Katrina, a Category 4 storm that did not strike the city directly, overwhelmed systems in dozens of places and cost more than 1,500 lives and billions in property damage.
 Why? In part, say experts who studied the disaster, because the hurricane was more like four storms -- at least -- that battered the area in different ways. They say the system in New Orleans was flawed from the start because the model storm it was designed to stop was simplistic, and led to an inadequate network of levees, flood walls, storm gates and pumps. 
 The 2006 hurricane season begins Thursday, with four to six major storms predicted for this year by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. And experts say that understanding the failings is essential in planning the next generation of flood protection for a rebuilt New Orleans, and for systems nationwide. 
 ''This is a national issue,'' said Raymond Seed, a professor of engineering at the University of California, Berkeley, and an author of a stinging report released last week. That report has identified flaws in design, construction and maintenance of the levees that contributed to the failures. But underlying it all, the report stated, were the problems with the initial model used to determine how strong the system should be.
 With the right hurricane protection, he said, the result of Hurricane Katrina would have been different: ''we call it 'wet ankles.' '' 
 The flood protection system was first authorized by Congress after Hurricane Betsy flooded the city in 1965, and it was supposed to protect the area from the kind of storm that would come only once in two centuries. It was expected to take about 13 years to complete and cost about $85 million, according to a history by the Government Accountability Office. 
 When Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans 40 years later, the system was still not finished, and it had already cost $738 million. In the eight months since the storm, the Corps of Engineers has spent some $800 million in direct costs to repair the system -- $62 million more than it had cost in the first place. 
 The main tool used to design the system was a fiction -- a hypothetical storm called the ''standard project hurricane.'' The corps began developing the model with the Weather Bureau in 1959. The idea, as the corps has put it , was that the model would represent ''the most severe storm that is considered reasonably characteristic of a region.''
 The corps based its model on data from previous storms, with some relatively straightforward calculations to estimate the surge and waves at various points. Maj. Gen. Don T. Riley, the director of civil works for the corps, said in an interview that the levee system ''was built at the standard of the time.''
 In hindsight, however, it was a rough and inadequate tool. This month, Dr. David Daniel, the chairman of a panel reviewing the corps' investigation, said in an interview, ''It was not a terribly sophisticated or detailed analysis by today's standards.'' 
 The report by Professor Seed's group found that the creators of the standard project hurricane, in an attempt to find a representative storm, actually excluded the fiercest storms from the database. 
 Storms like Hurricane Camille in 1969 were taken out of the data set as lying too far out of the norm; the Berkeley researchers noted that ''excluding outlier data is not appropriate in the context of dealing with extreme hazards.'' Also, the calculations of the cost-benefit ratio did not take into account the costs of failure, both economic and social, far greater in an urban area like New Orleans than a rural one. 
 Once the standard project hurricane was completed, characterizing it was difficult. The standard was developed before the Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale came into use, and the features of the storm fit poorly with the scale. The wind speed for the project hurricane was just 100 miles per hour, which falls into Category 2; other features more closely resemble a much more severe Category 4. The corps generally calls it the equivalent of a fast-moving Category 3.
 The standard project hurricane became enshrined within the corps, wrote the Berkeley group, and the corps saw little need to go back and reanalyze ''the true risks of catastrophic flooding'' in New Orleans. Even when the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the successor agency to the Weather Bureau, recommended increasing the strength of the model, the corps did not change its construction plans. 
 A report released this month by the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs said that calling the standard hurricane project storm a Category 3 was ''at best a rough estimate, and at worst, simply inaccurate,'' and gave New Orleanians a false sense of security. In the report, Al Naomi, the senior project manager for the corps on the system, admitted to a simplification borne of convenience -- or, as he put it to the Senate investigators, ''What am I going to tell the Rotary Club?''
 What the Rotary Club experienced last August was not what New Orleans was prepared for. The first stage of Hurricane Katrina touched Louisiana as it passed south of the city in the Plaquemines Parish town of Buras with winds of more than 125 miles per hour pushing a storm surge. The wind and water overwhelmed the local hurricane defenses: levees built to withstand 13 feet of water were overwhelmed by more than 17 feet of surge, damaging levees and scattering homes and boats across the thinly populated parish like toys.
 As the hurricane moved across Lake Borgne to the east, the effect was quite different: the second storm sent strong waves and a surge estimated at 18 feet or more back across the lake to the levees bordering St. Bernard Parish. The long levees there had been designed to handle 13 feet of water. The assault washed over Chalmette and other communities with floodwaters exceeding 14 feet in some areas. A similar pounding took out the southeastern levee of the development known as New Orleans East.
 In its third incarnation, the storm sent the water up a funnel formed at the northwest corner of Lake Borgne and into the city's Inner Harbor Navigation Canal, where the water rose and churned with exceptional force, said Hassan Mashriqui, a researcher with the Louisiana State University Hurricane Center. Those waters shattered flood walls in several places and destroyed the city's Lower Ninth Ward.
 As the storm pushed into Mississippi, it sent a final surge toward New Orleans across Lake Pontchartrain, north of the city. As the water stacked up against the south shore of the lake, it rose against the walls of the three main drainage canals that run from the center of the city. Though the surge was weaker than the others and the water did not reach the tops of the flood walls, the 17th Street Canal and the London Avenue Canal suffered breaches that caused the lake's waters to spill into the center of the city. 
 Other parts of the area, like the West Bank communities, fared comparatively well. ''If you were sitting over on the West Bank, you didn't think it was such a big deal,'' said Edward Link, an engineering professor at the University of Maryland, who is a leader of the corps investigation of the disaster. 
 Had the storm taken a westerly course instead, the effect would have been radically different, he said, and even a weak storm can, if it sits in one spot, cause profound flood damage. The lesson is that ''a single storm cannot be equated to a single set of forces, or a single wave or surge environment,'' he said. 
 Dr. Daniel, who is reviewing the corps inquiry, said that today's engineers based their designs for buildings in areas prone to hazards like floods and earthquakes on statistical analyses that run through all probable conditions and produce estimates that more closely characterize the risks. 
 The Netherlands has built flood protection to withstand surges that might be expected every 10,000 years. Jurjen Battjes, a flood expert there who is working with Dr. Daniel's group, said his nation began embracing the statistical approach in the 1930's and got a wake-up call with floods in the 1950's. The Dutch planners extrapolated conditions far greater than anything seen in history but still possible, he said, and estimated the costs of protection, including the economic and social costs of failure, and boiled it down to a cost-benefit curve. The ultimate decision, he said, is less technical than political: ''How much money do we want to spend now for protection in the future?'' 
 In New Orleans, the hurricane protection system has now been restored to the strength it was intended to have before the storm, and it will be further improved. Congress has told the corps to study ways to improve protection for southern Louisiana. And this time, said Daniel Hitchings, director of the corps task force in charge of overall hurricane recovery for the Gulf Coast, it will be done right, with the probabilistic approach that experts have called for and a greater willingness to take new data into account. 
 ''If we don't get the wake-up call now,'' he said, ''we never will.''

HEADLINE: Take This Internship and Shove It

BYLINE: By Anya Kamenetz. 
Anya Kamenetz, a columnist for The Village Voice, is the author of ''Generation Debt.''

 BODY:
MY younger sister has just arrived in New Orleans for the summer after her freshman year at Yale. She will be consuming daily snowballs, the local icy treat, to ward off the heat, volunteering to help clean up neighborhoods damaged by Hurricane Katrina and working part time, for pay, at both a literary festival and a local restaurant. Meanwhile, most of her friends from college are headed for the new standard summer experience: the unpaid internship.
 Instead of starting out in the mailroom for a pittance, this generation reports for business upstairs without pay. A national survey by Vault, a career information Web site, found that 84 percent of college students in April planned to complete at least one internship before graduating. Also according to Vault, about half of all internships are unpaid. 
 I was an unpaid intern at a newspaper from March 2002, my senior year, until a few months after graduation. I took it for granted, as most students do, that working without pay was the best possible preparation for success; parents usually agree to subsidize their offspring's internships on this basis. But what if we're wrong?
 What if the growth of unpaid internships is bad for the labor market and for individual careers?
 Let's look at the risks to the lowly intern. First there are opportunity costs. Lost wages and living expenses are significant considerations for the two-thirds of students who need loans to get through college. Since many internships are done for credit and some even cost money for the privilege of placement overseas or on Capitol Hill, those students who must borrow to pay tuition are going further into debt for internships. 
 Second, though their duties range from the menial to quasi-professional, unpaid internships are not jobs, only simulations. And fake jobs are not the best preparation for real jobs. 
 Long hours on your feet waiting tables may not be particularly edifying, but they teach you that work is a routine of obligation, relieved by external reward, where you contribute value to a larger enterprise. Newspapers and business magazines are full of articles expressing exasperation about how the Millennial-generation employee supposedly expects work to be exciting immediately, wears flip-flops to the office and has no taste for dues-paying. However true this stereotype may be, the spread of the artificially fun internship might very well be adding fuel to it.
 By the same token, internships promote overidentification with employers: I make sacrifices to work free, therefore I must love my work. A sociologist at the University of Washington, Gina Neff, who has studied the coping strategies of interns in communications industries, calls the phenomenon ''performative passion.'' Perhaps this emotion helps explain why educated workers in this country are less and less likely to organize, even as full-time jobs with benefits go the way of the Pinto. 
 Although it's not being offered this year, the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s Union Summer internship program, which provides a small stipend, has shaped thousands of college-educated career organizers. And yet interestingly, the percentage of young workers who hold an actual union card is less than 5 percent, compared with an overall national private-sector union rate of 12.5 percent. How are twentysomethings ever going to win back health benefits and pension plans when they learn to be grateful to work for nothing?
 So an internship doesn't teach you everything you need to know about coping in today's working world. What effect does it have on the economy as a whole? 
 The Bureau of Labor Statistics does not identify interns or track the economic impact of unpaid internships. But we can do a quick-and-dirty calculation: according to Princeton Review's ''Internship Bible,'' there were 100,000 internship positions in 2005. Let's assume that out of those, 50,000 unpaid interns are employed full time for 12 weeks each summer at an average minimum wage of $5.15 an hour. That's a nearly $124 million yearly contribution to the welfare of corporate America. 
 In this way, unpaid interns are like illegal immigrants. They create an oversupply of people willing to work for low wages, or in the case of interns, literally nothing. Moreover, a recent survey by Britain's National Union of Journalists found that an influx of unpaid graduates kept wages down and patched up the gaps left by job cuts. 
 There may be more subtle effects as well. In an information economy, productivity is based on the best people finding the jobs best suited for their talents, and interns interfere with this cultural capitalism. They fly in the face of meritocracy -- you must be rich enough to work without pay to get your foot in the door. And they enhance the power of social connections over ability to match people with desirable careers. A 2004 study of business graduates at a large mid-Atlantic university found that the completion of an internship helped people find jobs faster but didn't increase their confidence that those jobs were a good fit.
 With all this said, the intern track is not coming to an end any time soon. More and more colleges are requiring some form of internship for graduation. Still, if you must do an internship, research shows you will get more out of it if you find a paid one. 
 A 1998 survey of nearly 700 employers by the Institute on Education and the Economy at Columbia University's Teachers College found: ''Compared to unpaid internships, paid placements are strongest on all measures of internship quality. The quality measures are also higher for those firms who intend to hire their interns.'' This shouldn't be too surprising -- getting hired and getting paid are what work, in the real world, is all about.


CORRECTION-DATE: June 2, 2006

 CORRECTION:
An Op-Ed on Tuesday, about internships, misstated the percentage of private-sector workers who are unionized. It is 7.8 percent, not 12.5 percent, which is the rate for private and public workers combined.

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Bob Herbert paints a grim picture for American workers in ''Laid Off and Left Out'' (column, May 25). 
 The fact of the matter is that the Bush administration cuts taxes for the wealthy, claiming that this creates jobs. Unfortunately, the wealthy then turn around and cut American jobs, moving them overseas.
 It is not a vicious cycle but rather a downward economic spiral.

HEADLINE: Iran's Aspirations And American Policy

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Abbas Amanat describes what the Bush administration fails to understand: United States policies toward Iran on the nuclear issue inflame Iranian nationalistic tendencies and unite Iranians behind a government that the majority despises. 
 The theocracy in Iran has no agenda for governing; its legitimacy comes from the various international crises it can develop (first the hostage crisis, then the Iran-Iraq war and now the nuclear issue). As long as current United States policies toward Iran continue, the theocracy can blame the United States for the sorry state of its economy.
 If the United States wants a democratic Iranian state, it should negotiate with Iran. If the current international standoff is defused, the people will look to the Iranian government to improve their lives. With no crisis, reformist elements in Iran can question the government without being accused of supporting the enemy. Then the attention of the Iranian people will return to where it should be: on the abysmal state of the economy and lack of personal and political freedom.

HEADLINE: In the Works, Another Park For a Bit of the Waterfront 

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED

 BODY:
In its latest effort to reclaim waterfront land for recreation, New York City plans to turn a half-mile stretch of contaminated landfill and crumbled piers in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn into a park with panoramic views of the harbor and the Manhattan skyline.
 The landfill was created in the 1970's, when the city planned to convert the site, which it owns, into a cargo terminal. The city halted the landfill work in 1978, though, when it learned that the private contractor had allowed questionable material to be used. 
Investigators later found that elevated levels of arsenic, lead and other hazardous material were in the oil sludge, industrial waste water and other substances put in the landfill. 
 There has been no activity since the landfill work was stopped, and the entire half-mile stretch has been fenced off since at least the early 1980's. 
 The $36 million plan to correct the environmental hazards and remove the collapsing piers -- and to create ball fields, picnic and fishing areas and possibly an environmental education center -- was welcomed by Sunset Park residents interviewed last week. 
 ''It's only going to help the neighborhood,'' Alex Plasencia, who has lived in Sunset Park for 59 of his 63 years, said near his home on Fourth Avenue and 44th Street, four blocks away. The site runs from 43rd to 51st Streets, between the waterfront and a large complex of buildings and warehouses known as Bush Terminal. 
 Mr. Plasencia, a retired truck driver, recalled his boyhood in the neighborhood in the 1950's. ''I used to swim off the pier on 53rd Street,'' he said.
 Candida Villanueva, 56, standing in front of her home of two decades on 43rd Street between Second and Third Avenues, said, ''It will be better for it to be a park instead of all that mess.'' 
 Once completed, the park could cost her some of the quiet atmosphere she has now. The plan calls for 43rd Street to be one of two access streets to the park. ''Nobody comes down here now,'' she said. 
 That is because the side streets between the water and Third Avenue have more industrial and commercial tenants than residents. There is much less pedestrian traffic on those side streets than on the streets east of Third Avenue, where most of Sunset Park's working-class population lives. The elevated Gowanus Expressway travels above Third Avenue.
 Jeremy Laufer, district manager of Community Board 7, which includes Sunset Park, said the public's only access to the two miles of waterfront in Sunset Park now is a pier at 58th Street, which serves as a terminal for a ferry to Lower Manhattan.
 The plan for more waterfront access here follows projects in recent years that have created a ribbon of new parkland along the Hudson River in Manhattan, and plans for parks in other largely inaccessible shoreline areas of Brooklyn, near the Brooklyn Bridge and in Williamsburg and Greenpoint. 
 The largest share of the expected $36 million cost of the Sunset Park project will come from the state: $17.8 million, earmarked for the landfill work, said Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Michael R. Blooomberg in describing the project last month. The city and federal governments are to supply the rest of the money. 
 Mr. Pataki called the $17.8 million the largest grant the state has awarded to fix a so-called brownfield. A spokesman for his office said the previous largest amount was $7.6 million.
 According to a 2004 report by the state's Department of Environmental Conservation, ''elevated levels'' of arsenic and lead were found at various locations in the landfill. It says there are lesser levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, chemical compounds that the federal Environmental Protection Agency calls a probable carcinogen.
 The state report says that among the steps to remove ''potential risks to future park visitors and workers'' will be a two-foot-deep cover of new soil over the current landfill surface, except that it will be six inches where trees have grown on the landfill and are to be retained. 
 The work on the landfill is expected to begin next year, and the park is expected to be completed in several years, said Janel Patterson, a spokeswoman for the city's Economic Development Corporation, which is coordinating the project.
 Details remain to be worked out. Because the park will be a long walk from the homes of many Sunset Park residents and no parking areas are planned in the park, Mr. Laufer said his community board would seek to have bus routes extended to the park. And weekday truck traffic is heavy immediately around the park site.
 ''We're working with the community to assure safe and regular access,'' Ms. Patterson said.

HEADLINE: Polish Energy Company to Buy Most of Lithuanian Oil Refinery

BYLINE: By JUDY DEMPSEY; International Herald Tribune

DATELINE: BERLIN, May 30 

 BODY:
Despite resistance from Russia, the largest energy group in Poland has signed a deal to buy a majority stake in a Lithuanian oil refinery from a subsidiary of Yukos, the energy giant that was bankrupted by Kremlin tax claims. 
 Orlen, the biggest oil refining company in Poland, will pay $1.49 billion to Yukos International, based in the Netherlands, for its 53.7 percent stake in the Mazeikiu Nafta refinery. The Lithuanian government will also sell its 30.7 percent stake in the refiner to Orlen for $851.8 million, once the Yukos sale is approved by the European Commission and the Lithuanian Parliament.
The sale of the refinery stake to Orlen is intended to give Poland and Lithuania more secure energy supplies and the opportunity to diversify their energy sources amid growing concern that President Vladimir Putin of Russia is using his country's vast oil and natural gas reserves as a political tool.
 ''This is a very important deal for Poland and Lithuania because it means close cooperation between two countries that are very concerned about the future of energy security,'' said Zygimantas Pavilionis, director of the European Department at the Lithuanian Foreign Ministry. 
 On Sunday, the United States Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan lifted an order blocking Yukos International from carrying out the sale. 
 Orlen is Central Europe's largest refiner of crude oil and has an extensive retail network in Poland, Germany and the Czech Republic. It had revenue of $8.36 billion in 2004 and net profit of $985 million. 
 The Mazeikiu Nafta refinery produces 10 million tons of oil a year. The refinery provides 10 percent of Lithuania's gross domestic product and receives all of its oil from Transneft, the Russian pipeline monopoly. 
 It is also the owner and operator of pipeline systems and a terminal on the Baltic Sea for the shipment of oil and refinery products to Western Europe and the United States. 
 Lithuania, which had unsuccessful experiences privatizing its energy sector in the late 1990's, depends on Russia for 100 percent of its natural gas. 
 Poland, which has substantial coal deposits, imports 60 percent of its natural gas from Russia. 
 But ever since Russia cut off its gas supplies to Ukraine in January over a price dispute, worries about energy security have mounted across Europe. Poland, Lithuania and the two other Baltic States, Estonia and Latvia, have urged the European Union to draw up a common energy policy.

HEADLINE: Antiwar Resolution

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER

 BODY:
A long-shot challenger to Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton is highlighting the senator's support of the Iraq war by introducing a resolution here this week at the state Democratic convention calling for the withdrawal of all troops. 
 The proposed resolution caused a stir among the delegates, many of whom are opposed to the war, but wary of doing anything that would embarrass Senator Clinton.
The challenger, Jonathan Tasini, handed in petitions for a resolution that read, ''As Democrats, we believe that our state party must act now to hasten an end to the violence in Iraq, bring our men and women home and cease the waste of our economic resources on an immoral war.'' Mr. Tasini said he had collected about 2,500 signatures.
 The chairman of the State Democratic Party, Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell, said that Mr. Tasini did not get his resolution in on time, explaining that it must be handed in 15 days before the convention. Still, he said, the resolution could pass if a delegate introduces it from the floor and two-thirds of the delegates support it. 
 Mr. Farrell said that he thought such a resolution would be redundant. ''We have taken positions opposed to the war,'' he said.
 Mr. Tasini, a labor advocate, said that his campaign had been told the resolution could be submitted the day before the convention. ''You can read into that what you want -- I'm going to be charitable and assume it was an honest mistake,'' he said.
 Mr. Tasini said he believed it would be hard to win a two-thirds vote for the resolution, because it would probably be offered on Wednesday after the last candidates were selected, when many delegates leave the convention.
 ''If we don't have a full debate on the war, how are we different than the Republicans?'' he asked. ''My opponent does not want to have a debate on the war, because then primary voters will find out that she is out of step with New Yorkers.'' MICHAEL COOPER

HEADLINE: Trans-Atlantic or Bust? Hardly, Make That a Boom. 

BYLINE: By Joe Sharkey

 BODY:
ON most airlines, the walk-up fare is more than $9,000 for a round-trip business-class ticket between New York and London, though corporate discounts can bring the fare down to $5,000 or even less if the corporation can guarantee the airline enough business. 
 That's a lot of money to shell out for a six-hour flight, no matter how good the food or how comfortable the seat. Yet it's one of the wonders of modern airline travel that the premium trans-Atlantic markets, and especially the New York-London routes, are thriving -- to the point where United States airlines have been yanking their longer-haul, wide-body planes from domestic service and putting them into trans-Atlantic service. 
Both American Airlines and United Airlines, for example, are soon planning to announce major upgrades, costing well over $100 million each, in international business-class cabins, the central features of which will be replacing the recliner seats with lie-flat seats and improving entertainment. 
 And Delta Air Lines, which recently shifted 13 of its wide-body 767's from domestic to international service, will introduce a new BusinessElite product on its route from New York to Kiev, Ukraine, later this week, starting a refurbishment that will be complete throughout the carrier's international network by the end of next year. 
 Given how lucrative the trans-Atlantic business-class service is, airlines based in the United States have little choice but to upgrade. After all, their foreign competitors on the trans-Atlantic routes -- including British Airlines, Virgin Atlantic and Lufthansa -- offer far more luxurious business-class cabins, even though the published fares are about the same. British Air is about to announce details of a $170 million business-class upgrade.
 Even with their upgrades, said Joe Brancatelli, the publisher of the subscription business-travel Web site Joesentme.com, United States airlines ''will still be at least three years behind'' the standards of the international pace-setters.
 Meanwhile, new low-fare, all-business-class airlines have carved out small market shares, despite skeptics who thought that the airlines, Eos and MaxJet, would be belly-up by spring. 
 In fact, a third trans-Atlantic all-business-class discounter, Silverjet, recently emerged, saying it was capitalized at about $62.8 million. The British-based airline said it planned to start twice-daily service between New York and London's Luton Airport in six to nine months, with 767 aircraft configured with lie-flat beds, and offering round-trip fares of about $1,875. 
 Eos, which uses Boeing 757's configured with a mere 48 lie-flat seats, flies between New York and London's Stansted Airport. Round-trip fares range from about $1,500 to more than $3,250. MaxJet, which started out flying between New York and London's Stansted, and recently added service between Washington-Dulles and Stansted, charges from $2,500 to $3,500 round trip. 
 Eos's luxurious business-class product competes with the top-niche foreign business-class products. MaxJet, on the other hand, uses 767's configured with 102 business-class seats. Its business class compares favorably with United States airlines, though at a far lower price. (Of course, both Eos and MaxJet have very limited schedules and don't have major airline advantages like worldwide networks and alliances).
 I thought the Eos product was top notch when I tested it last year. I haven't flown MaxJet yet. But Frank Murray, a reader who reported to me recently about his first MaxJet flight, said it was a ''terrific value'' and that the airline's ''nearly flat seats accommodated my 6'4'' frame very nicely.'' 
 He said the service and the in-flight entertainment systems were excellent. He wasn't wild about the food. He said his eastbound flight on April 23 was about 60 percent full, and the westbound flight five days later had 92 of 102 seats occupied. 
 Gary Rogliano, the chief executive of MaxJet, said the New York-London route had been running, on average, more than 70 percent full, with most customers paying ''the low end'' of its fare structure. He said 84 percent of his customers ''are coming out of the business classes of the majors.'' To make sure potential customers who usually fly coach consider MaxJet as an alternative, the airline deliberately enters two fare codes into network distributions systems. The business class fare is $1 more than the economy fare.
 Discount international business-class travel is here to stay, Mr. Rogliano said. ''You're going to see more and more disparity'' in those fares and service, he said. ''People who won't or can't pay $7,000 to $9,000 will have a business-class choice that's affordable.''

HEADLINE: A Senate Challenger Works to Shorten His Long Odds

BYLINE: By WILLIAM YARDLEY

DATELINE: HARTFORD, May 29 

 BODY:
Ned Lamont has already shown that his candidacy should be taken seriously. On May 19, a third of the delegates to the Democratic state convention voted to endorse him instead of Senator Joseph I. Lieberman. 
 Now, with just over two months until he faces the senator in the Aug. 8 primary, Mr. Lamont hopes to defy polls, political experts and the calendar and win the nomination. To do so, he must greatly expand on the support he has won for voicing opposition to Senator Lieberman's support for President Bush on key aspects of the war in Iraq.
Mr. Lamont's skills as a campaigner, some political observers say, are critical to accomplishing his goal. They cite his high energy, his sharp wit and his knowledge of issues, and his ability to convince voters that he is a legitimate challenger. His great wealth and his willingness to use it also cannot hurt. 
 ''Once you scratch and sniff, you realize he would be a very credible senator, and that makes him a very credible candidate,'' said George Jepsen, the immediate past chairman of the Democratic State Central Committee. ''If he was a nut, Joe wouldn't have a problem. But he's intelligent. He's accomplished. There are no personal warts. He teaches in the Bridgeport public schools. How many people of his pedigree and background go do that?''
 Mr. Jepsen, who supported Senator Lieberman in past races, has not taken a public position in the primary. He is among many Democrats, however, who predict that voters who are angry with Mr. Lieberman are likely to turn out in great numbers in the primary. The senator, he said, is ''genuinely threatened on Aug. 8.''
 Yet Mr. Lamont has little time to make his case against a three-term incumbent. Some political experts and some supporters of Senator Lieberman point to polls showing that he remains popular in the state, even if he is more popular among Republicans than he is among Democrats. They also note his high ratings from liberal interest groups and his support among prominent elected Democrats. 
 Mr. Lamont, 52, might seem an unlikely challenger. He comes from Greenwich, where Republicans outnumber Democrats two to one. His great-grandfather, Thomas W. Lamont, made his fortune as a partner with J. P. Morgan and was a benefactor of the Lamont Library at Harvard. His father worked in the Nixon administration. And he is rich, with a net worth of $90 million to $300 million, according to financial disclosure forms filed with the Federal Election Commission.
 Mr. Lamont attended boarding school at Phillips Exeter Academy and went on to college at Harvard, and later to management school at Yale. He ran a newspaper in Vermont after college -- The Black River Tribune, in Ludlow. He worked for Cablevision after finishing at Yale. 
 He later started his own business, Lamont Digital Systems, which installs cable systems for college campuses. He teaches a class at Harding High School, a public school in Bridgeport, on how to be an entrepreneur. His wife, Annie, is a venture capitalist. 
 This is not Mr. Lamont's first venture into politics. He served as a selectman in Greenwich from 1987 to 1989, lost a State Senate race in 1990 and raised money for the presidential campaigns of former Senator Bill Bradley in 2000 and Senator John Kerry in 2004, as well as for Howard Dean, now the chairman of the Democratic National Committee.
 ''He's always supported progressive presidential candidates,'' said Nick Paindiris, who was the coordinator for Senator Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign in Connecticut and is a member of the party's state central committee. ''But he was always in the background. Even though he brought a lot of money to the events, he wasn't the one whose name was on the event. He wasn't seeking the limelight.''
 Mr. Paindiris, who has supported Senator Lieberman in the past, called Mr. Lamont ''a very progressive, principled individual.'' About the senator, he said, ''For me the central issue is not the war, it's Joe Lieberman's allegiance to the Democratic Party. I question it.'' 
 Mr. Lamont said that his frequent meetings with voters had altered his views on some issues. Initially, he said, he considered some job losses caused by free-trade agreements to be a necessary ''transition cost'' for succeeding in a world economy. But after meeting manufacturing workers who had been laid off, he said he realized that ''we're going to have to be respectful of our workers when it comes to negotiating a trade agreement.''
 He said he had regarded President Bush's No Child Left Behind education policy as having some positive elements, such as ''having a benchmark and seeing how schools perform.'' But after talking with teachers, parents and students, he said that he has decided that ''fundamentally, the bill is irrelevant.''
 Amid his transformation from political unknown to threat, Mr. Lamont has confronted questions that may become louder as his campaign speeds forward. Is he about more than the war? Should anyone take seriously a wealthy political novice who is trying to unseat one of the most influential figures in his party, an incumbent with $4.3 million in his campaign account as of April 30?
 Mr. Lamont has gradually refined his answers. He links the war to domestic policy: ''As long as you're spending $250 million a day in Iraq, what does that say about investing in universal health care for all Americans and what does that say about education?'' He dismisses questions about his wealth as a distraction, but says he is ready to spend beyond the $1 million he has already invested in his campaign, ''if I have to go and defend myself.'' 
 ''On paper, from a distance, you can stereotype me pretty fast,'' he said. ''But I get in front of people, say what I'm about, talk about the family, talk about the business, talk about the issues. And I think we're doing pretty well.''

HEADLINE: Giving Beer Its Place at the Table

BYLINE: By Frank Bruni

 BODY:
''CLOVE?'' I asked, not quite sure I had heard him correctly.
 ''Clove,'' he answered without hesitation.
''Huh,'' I said, for two reasons. The first was that I was already hoisting the beer to my lips for another sip, so I had to be quick and economical with my syllables. The second: I was flustered. Try as I might to latch onto them, the promised notes of clove in the brew eluded me.
 But I had hope. The beer sommelier had also foretold currents of orange, and their presence in this Leffe Blonde from Belgium was incontrovertible. He had talked about the ''aromatics'' at work, and there was indeed a citrusy, flowery perfume.
 Could he be wrong about the clove? I concentrated. I searched my palate for what was behind the orange or maybe in front of the orange or possibly on the side of the orange. 
 No clove, at least not for me. But I was having what I suppose I should describe as a heady time rooting around for it.
 Cafe d'Alsace, a new brasserie on the Upper East Side, brings the fetishism and free-association usually reserved for wine to the exaltation of beer. It has more than 110 kinds. It assigns them bin numbers and groups them under different headings: ''wheat,'' ''bock,'' ''lambic.''
 It pairs them with foods. The Leffe Blonde, in fact, was the beer sommelier's tailored recommendation for an appetizer of warm potato salad with Alsatian Muenster cheese.
 And if that salad had been forgettable, all of the frothy rigmarole surrounding it and the rest of the menu at Cafe d'Alsace might have come across as an annoying gimmick meant to distract diners from unremarkable food.
 But it wasn't. The tender cubes of potato and melted cheese formed an ideal partnership, with or without the fervent orange and fugitive clove in the brew beside them. And this terrific dish kept company with many other winners: a goat cheese tart as sumptuous on the inside and flaky on the outside as you could wish it to be; a plump, moist wedge of fresh salmon smoked to order and surrounded by dark lentils. 
 Subtract the obscure ales at Cafe d'Alsace and you still have a very appealing restaurant, its cooking accomplished (though inconsistent), its energy infectious. Put them back into the equation and you have something special, a solid neighborhood restaurant with a claim to distinction beyond its neighborhood. 
 I don't think any other New York restaurant combines this many Pilseners with food this sturdy. Cafe d'Alsace won't just be beer today and gone tomorrow.
 It's the creation of Simon Oren, who knows a thing or two about successful brasseries. Refusing to cede the city to gnocchi and gnudi, Mr. Oren has made a career of colonizing needy neighborhoods with the likes of steak frites and creme brulee. He brought Gallic pick-me-up's to the theater district (Marseille) and the Upper West Side (Nice Matin).
 That left the Upper East Side, where Cafe d'Alsace opened about three months ago. To run the kitchen Mr. Oren hired Philippe Roussel, who had cooked at Montparnasse and Chelsea Bar and Bistro.
 Mr. Roussel does justice to his new showcase's name by focusing his mostly French menu on Alsace and its hearty fare. You won't leave hungry, certainly not if you order the pleasant and filling choucroute garnie, which lavished a bevy of meats on sauerkraut that had been cooked with riesling. Along with several kinds of pork sausage there was a pillowy boudin blanc of veal and pork and -- just in case you weren't getting enough protein and fat -- hunks of flabby pork belly.
 All of the restaurant's sausages were excellent, including a livery duck sausage and an ethereal seafood sausage made with a shrimp, scallop and cod mousse. A follow-the-sausage ordering strategy would be prudent, as would a follow-the-bacon approach, pointing you toward the Alsatian soup, brimming with white beans as well as bacon, and the baeckeoffe, a traditional Alsatian casserole with bacon, lamb, oxtails and no small measure of potatoes. I suppose it's for diners who find the choucroute garnie too dainty.
 I encountered a few too many dishes, including a wanly flavored veal breast and a gummy beer-braised lamb shank, that weren't really for anyone. I encountered others, like an onion-laden tarte flambee and a heavily sauced hanger steak, that could have been better.
 But I loved an appetizer of marrow bones. I liked an appetizer of frog's legs. If tuna is the chicken of the sea, frog's legs are the chicken wings of the haute pond, which is to say they're ready, efficient conveyors of whatever they've been coated in or doused with. These conveyed garlic and butter and butter and garlic. Message received, and relished.
 On visit after visit, I packed away more dessert than I meant to, entering a sort of fugue state upon seeing and tasting the Frisbee-sized apple tart or the bewitchingly salted chocolate tart. 
 I got a buzz from the surroundings: a long zinc bar; a brilliant spectrum of seltzer bottles above it; a diverse mix of smiling, chattering diners at tables positioned close to one another, but not ridiculously so.
 Let's face it: I also got a buzz from the beers. One night I tried the effervescent Belgian Deus Brut de Flandres, which comes in what looks like a Champagne bottle and is served in Champagne flutes. Another night I ventured into the sour realm of the lambic -- and beat a hasty retreat.
 And yet another night I heeded the advice of Aviram Turgeman, the beer sommelier (I had to use the phrase just one more time), and started out with the Belgian golden ale Duvel, which he said would ''cleanse the palate and awaken the stomach.''
 That seemed like a lot of responsibility for a beer. But time and again, we've asked as much of wine. Why not, on occasion, let a lager carry the load?

EVERY once in a while an unfamiliar wine region rises and demands attention. Suddenly, that region and its wines begin to wallpaper your mind like a new hit tune, so that you can't get them out of your head. Most recently, I've been hearing the song of the red wines of Bierzo.
 Bierzo? Absolutely. It's a small, ancient region in the northwestern corner of Castilla y Leon, almost on the eastern border of Galicia, which is due north of Portugal on the Atlantic coast. Most wine drinkers, I suspect, have never heard of Bierzo, but word is getting around. And if you get the opportunity to taste a good bottle, with its haunting, exotic wildflower, licorice and fruit flavors, you can't help but remember it. 
Spain has offered up more than a few big new things in the last 20 years. Though it had more acres of vineyards planted than any other country, only Rioja and sherry registered on the consciousness of the world. Years of repressive government kept the wine industry antiquated. But reform and greater economic freedom in the 1980's brought investment and innovation and Spain is now a leader in modern winemaking. Think of the regions and wines that have become noteworthy in the last two decades: Ribera del Duero, albarino from Galicia, verdejo from Rueda, Txakoli from the Basque region, Penedes, Toro, Jumilla and Priorat.
 Bierzo is now on that list, and judging by the Dining section wine panel's tasting, it deserves the spotlight. Florence Fabricant and I were joined by two guests, Roger Kugler, sommelier at Suba, a Spanish restaurant on the Lower East Side, and Gerald Marzorati, an assistant managing editor of The New York Times with an interest in Spanish wines.
 We sampled 16 bottles, fewer than our usual 25, because those were all we could find. It's an indication, partly, of how few producers in Bierzo are marketing their wines to the world. Indeed, those 16 bottles came from just nine producers, with one, Descendientes de J. Palacios, accounting for five of them.
 If you have been following Spanish wines, Palacios may be a familiar name. Alvaro Palacios was among the pioneers who brought the Priorat region to international attention in the late 1980's. In 1999, he and his nephew Ricardo Perez Palacios established Descendientes de J. Palacios in Bierzo, hoping to achieve a full range of successful wines.
 It was a formidable challenge. The leading red grapes traditionally planted in Priorat, garnacha and carinena, were somewhat familiar to wine drinkers outside of Spain as grenache and carignane. But the signature red grape of Bierzo, the mencia, is practically unknown. In a business that relies on familiarity for its marketing, this was a serious disadvantage.
 To their credit, new Bierzo producers like Palacios and Dominio de Tares, which was founded in 2000 and produced three of our 16 bottles, stuck with the mencia grape instead of replacing it with fashionable varietals like merlot or syrah. Indeed, these producers acquired mencia vineyards, planted on steep hillsides, that were 40, 50 even 100 years old.
 The beauty of these old-vine vineyards is apparent in wines like our No. 1 bottle from Palacios, a 2002 from a single vineyard, Fontelas, in Corullon. This was clearly an ambitious bottle, with plenty of toasty oak flavors. Yet the fruit, mineral and floral aromas and flavors were intense enough to stand up to the oak, and the wine had both power and harmony. It also had a price tag, $99, that made it the most expensive bottle in our lineup. It should improve with a few years of aging. 
 Our No. 2 wine, a 2003 Vega Montan from Bodegas Adria, was also our best value at $16. This was an earthy, floral wine with complex, balanced flavors that really allow you to appreciate the quality of the mencia grape. Two other inexpensive wines also finished high on our list, a 2003 from Pago de Valdoneje for $11 and a 2003 Pucho for $14.
 Why did we prefer these wines to some others, like the '01 Villa de Corullon from Palacios, the '02 Bembibre from Dominio de Tares for $45, our No. 9 wine, and an '02 Paixar for $90, which did not make our cut? To varying degrees, both of these ambitious wines sacrificed some of the qualities that make Bierzo distinctive in favor of oaky vanilla flavors that could come from anywhere.
 In ancient regions all over the world, this tension between distinctive wines and geographically indistinguishable wines screams out as producers aim for the international market. It's a matter both of style and of economics. Do you make wines that emphasize the singular qualities of a particular region and its grapes, and hope that the world will admire them? Or do you aim to make wines in styles with a track record of popularity? 
 It's easy to understand the economic impetus for choosing the popular path. Yet in Bierzo, I think, it's more complicated than that. As in southern Italy, where nobody really knows the limits of what can be done with the aglianico grape, producers are exploring the potential of the mencia. Its appeal as an easygoing wine is evident; these wines will go with a wide range of hearty foods.
 But what happens when you employ modern techniques in the vineyard and the cellar in an effort to produce wines worthy of aging? Can you still tease out elements that will make these wines supreme expressions of Bierzo rather than some generic super-Spanish wines? With the Fontelas, we guessed yes. With some of the other big wines, we were less certain. 
 Nonetheless, I have to give the Bierzo producers the benefit of the doubt. They are giving the world mencia, and they ought to be congratulated for that. It could so easily have been syrah, again.

HEADLINE: Ending Months of Resistance, Engelhard Accepts BASF Bid

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, May 30 

 BODY:
Dropping five months of resistance to a bear hug from across the Atlantic, the Engelhard Corporation of New Jersey agreed on Tuesday to be acquired by BASF of Germany for about $5 billion.
 The decision by Engelhard, which is based in Iselin, N.J., and is best known as the pioneer of the catalytic converter for cars, came after BASF raised its offer a second time, to $39 a share.
The announcement by Engelhard that it would recommend the offer to its shareholders ended a stubborn battle to extract a higher price from BASF, the world's largest chemical company. Engelhard rebuffed two previous offers, tried unsuccessfully to drum up a competing bid and finally proposed to buy back 20 percent of its shares at a higher price than the BASF offer. 
 But BASF did not back down. It used remarkably aggressive tactics for a company in Germany, where hostile takeovers are rare. BASF executives pitched the offer directly to Engelhard shareholders and proposed five of their own candidates to be elected to the board.
 ''We are confident that Engelhard's shareholders will tender their shares into our offer,'' Jurgen Hambrecht, the chairman of BASF, said in a statement from the company's headquarters in Ludwigshafen.
 BASF's overseas foray is one of several made by European companies in the last few months -- a boldness that analysts said reflected both rising corporate profits and the more robust economy in Europe.
 Analysts said that even after sweetening its offer, by $2 a share, BASF was paying a reasonable price for Engelhard. The company's stock has recently traded at $38 to $39 a share. It rose above $40 in late January, in the weeks after BASF made its first, unsolicited bid of $37 a share.
 Shares of Engelhard rose 25 cents, to $38.93, on the New York Stock Exchange, while BASF slipped 2.4 percent in Frankfurt, where shares were generally lower.
 For BASF, analysts said, Engelhard was worth the fight because it expands the company's presence in the United States and is a way for BASF to smooth out the cycles in its chemical business.
 ''We see strong demand for catalytic converters in coming years,'' said Jurgen Reck, a chemicals analyst at Sal. Oppenheim in Cologne. ''The truck and automotive catalyst business is benefiting from tougher emissions standards in the U.S. and Europe.''
 Catalytic converters were introduced in the 1970's and are credited with reducing smog and air pollution by breaking down carbon monoxide and harmful gases produced by automobile engines. Engelhard makes roughly a third of the converters installed in vehicles worldwide.
 The all-cash deal is the largest in BASF's history. Analysts said the company has worked to reduce its vulnerability to the volatility of the chemical industry by negotiating natural gas joint ventures in Russia and buying the construction chemicals business of Degussa.
 BASF still faces a challenge in integrating Engelhard, given that its executives fiercely resisted a deal. Some analysts question whether Engelhard's chairman, Barry W. Perry, will remain.
 ''At times, I thought Engelhard was being irrational,'' said Bjorn Wolber, an analyst at Independent Research in Frankfurt. ''Their proposal of a self-tender was not plausible.''
 A spokesman for Engelhard, Ted Lowen, said the company had tried to give its shareholders an alternative to the previous BASF offer. He added it was too soon to speculate about management changes.
 In a statement, Mr. Perry said, ''our board has determined that the $39 per share offer provides fair value to our shareholders, and the agreement paves the way for an orderly and cooperative transaction.''

HEADLINE: Consumer Confidence Drops;Job Expectations Are Also Lower

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Consumer confidence soured in May, as Americans worried about the future of the economy and the outlook for jobs. A widely watched barometer of sentiment fell sharply, the most since hurricanes pummeled the Gulf Coast last year, increasing concern about future retail spending. 
 The Conference Board said yesterday that its consumer confidence index fell almost 7 points, to 103.2, from a revised reading of 109.8 in April. Still, the May index was better than the 100.9 expected by analysts.
The decline interrupted a rebound in the index that had been going on since November, after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. 
 ''Consumer confidence, which reached a four-year high in April, lost ground in May,'' Lynn Franco, director of the Conference Board Consumer Research Center, based in New York, said in a statement. ''Apprehension about the short-term outlook for the economy, the labor market and consumers' earning potential has driven the expectations index down to levels not seen since the aftermath of the hurricanes.''
 Still, Ms. Franco said, consumers rate current conditions favorably.
 The expectations index, which measures consumers' outlook over the next six months, fell to 83.7 in May from 92.3 in April. The proportion of consumers expecting their incomes to rise in the months ahead fell to the lowest level in three years, the survey showed. The present situation index, which measures how people feel now about economic conditions, slipped to 132.5 from 136.2.
 Those expecting that more jobs will become available in the next few months declined to 14.6 percent from 15.4 percent in April. Those expecting fewer jobs rose to 18.2 percent from 16.3 percent. The share of people expecting their incomes to rise in the months ahead fell to 16.6 percent from 18 percent, the lowest level since 15.9 percent in July 2003.

HEADLINE: Is It Tableware Or a Leading Indicator?

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
E-mail: leonhardt@nytimes.com

 BODY:
JUST a few years ago, you could still walk into the Michael C. Fina store on Fifth Avenue and get a good deal on some flatware. Past the three-carat diamond rings in the front counter, down the stairs and into the wedding registry area, you would have found the Italian-made line of Barocco flatware -- two forks, two spoons and a knife -- selling for less than $200. 
 That same five-piece set now costs $260, thanks to an explosion in the price of silver over the last year. ''The flatware world,'' said Jeffrey Fina, a vice president at the store and a grandson of Michael C., ''has taken a very big hit.'' 
 The same thing has happened to the gold and platinum rings on the store's ground floor. With gold prices rising almost 50 percent over the last year, this summer's brides and grooms are looking at a much more expensive wedding than last summer's. 
 But to a cadre of economists who use the price of gold as their crystal ball, those brides and grooms should not be the main object of our sympathy. The United States economy should be. 
 The boom in gold and silver, these economists say, is a sign that this country is finally going to pay for years of easy money, mounting debt, cheap Asian imports and trillion-dollar budget deficits. Welcome to your new job, Henry Paulson.
 GOLD and silver have provided a reality check for profligate governments as far back as ancient Rome. Starting with the little-loved emperor Nero, Roman rulers began to use less and less metallic content in their coins so they could mint more money, as Peter L. Bernstein, the longtime Wall Street consultant, wrote in his book ''The Power of Gold'' (Wiley, 2000). 
 When the Roman people figured out what was going on, the value of the coins began dropping rapidly. In one 44-year period, prices of everyday Roman items rose by a factor of 20. Only when the emperor Constantine issued a nearly pure new coin called the solidus did inflation come under control.
 Ever since, gold -- and, to a lesser extent, silver -- has been a refuge for investors worried about a country's economic policy. Other than adornment, in fact, this is one of gold's only uses. A government can issue all the currency it wants, thereby driving down the value of the money already in circulation, but it can't conjure gold out of thin air. 
 ''We have gold,'' Herbert Hoover wrote, ''because we cannot trust governments.''
 Pure gold is currently selling for $653 a troy ounce, less than the peak of $729 it hit earlier this month, but still more than at any other point in more than 25 years. Back then, Bette Midler typified people's economic fears, Mr. Bernstein notes, when she demanded that her $600,000 payment for a European tour be made in South African gold coins rather than the rapidly shriveling United States dollar. 
 Today's gold mania has certainly not reached the same level, but it's easy to see some parallels. On eBay, 9,500 gold bars and other pieces of bullion changed hands in a recent two-week period -- or one every two minutes -- a 27 percent increase over the previous two weeks. 
 An increase in the value of gold is really the same thing as a decrease in the value of a dollar, relative to the oldest, most solid benchmark of all. And there are plenty of reasons dollars should be losing value. Americans have been sending billions of them overseas to buy other countries' products, causing the world to be awash in dollars. The federal government has been spending much more money than it takes in, and the Federal Reserve pumped the economy full of cash a few years ago to avoid a deep recession.
 There are legitimate reasons, in other words, to wonder if the gold surge is the start of the crisis that economists have long feared. ''The gold value of the dollar appears to be going into free fall,'' two investment strategists recently wrote on The Wall Street Journal's editorial page, long a home for gold worriers. ''What we are facing is a money crisis: an alarming outbreak of inflation and all its consequences.''
 So I called Mr. Bernstein, the gold historian who has been advising investors since the 1950's, to see what he made of all this. The first thing he mentioned was an indicator he had invented 20 years ago called the Grim Index. It tracks the price of gold (the ''G'') relative to the price of other raw industrial materials (the ''r.i.m.''), like copper.
 When gold is moving with those other materials, it's a sign that basic economic dynamics are at work. Prices rise when the world's economy is growing rapidly, and they fall when there is more supply of the commodities than demand for them. 
 But when gold prices spike and prices for other materials do not, Mr. Bernstein says, it means that investors are treating gold as a place to store their money in advance of a crisis. This is precisely what happened in the late 1970's.
 In the last few years, however, the prices of gold and the other commodities have gone up sharply. Computer makers are using copper, airplane manufacturers are buying more aluminum and the rise of India -- the world's most gold-crazy country -- is increasing the demand for jewelry. 
 And because commodity prices actually fell from the late 1980's to 2002, the recent surge has in part been making up for lost ground. The price of gold still hasn't risen as much, in percentage terms, as the price of milk over the last 20 years. 
 Like Mr. Bernstein, most economists are reluctant to read too much into gold's big rally. ''If you simply look at a graph of the price of gold, it sure looks like the world is going down the tube,'' he said. ''But if you look at it this other way, it gives you entirely another feeling.''
 There is no question that the trade deficit and budget deficit are real problems, as Mr. Bernstein acknowledges. ''All the necessary conditions for a mess are there,'' he said. The mess itself, however, doesn't seem to have arrived.

HEADLINE: An Old Textile Center, Refashioned for Luxury 

BYLINE: By C. J. HUGHES

DATELINE: NORWICH, Conn. 

 BODY:
Just a few hours into his first day on the job here in November 2003, a piece of a window fell from an old building and crashed at Richard Kramer's feet.
 ''I thought, 'Wow, it's going to be a very, very busy year,' '' said Mr. Kramer, executive director of Rose City Renaissance, a local group that is leading the revitalization of Norwich, a former textile powerhouse in southeastern Connecticut.
Now, after two and a half years and a $1 million renovation, that building, which is at 130 Main, has four rental apartments, all leased, as well as office space and a bar, the Harp and Dragon, which opened on the ground floor earlier this month. Cap Realty, based in Norwich, developed the building. 
 It is just one piece of evidence of what seems to be a reversal of fortunes in Norwich, as developers convert its old mills and hotels to luxury apartments and open stores and restaurants. The city languished for much of the 20th century, after the closing of mills that churned out pistols, Thermos bottles, radiators and, most notably, fabrics.
 Today, however, housing in the town is much in demand from workers at casinos in the area.
 According to the city's planning office, 30 commercial projects are under way in Norwich, including both new construction and rehabs. Developers are also building 1,800 housing units, some of them single-family homes but most of them condos. The city expects another 700 units to be started this year. ''This is easily the largest postwar construction that the city has seen,'' said Peter Davis, the planning director. 
 In downtown Norwich, a compact collection of ornate 19th-century buildings lining hilly streets at the junction of the Quinebaug and Shetucket Rivers, the finishing touches are being put on the Wauregan Hotel, an 1855 building within the Main Street district, which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In its heyday, the hotel was billed as the most luxurious hotel between New York and Boston.
 The $25 million project, which was first proposed in 1997, has led to the creation of 70 rental apartments, with tenants expected to move in by July, according to Bruce Redman Becker, president of Becker & Becker Associates, the developer, based in Fairfield, Conn. Most are one-bedrooms, priced at $650 to $800 a month, slightly below market to qualify for state and federal tax credits. There are also two-bedrooms for $870 to $970, and some $300 studios reserved for those who make less than $15,000 a year. 
 Becker & Becker also restored the Wauregan's second-floor ballroom, which will be rented out for meetings and functions, he said.
 Two of the four retail spaces on the ground floor, which are still under construction but should be completed by September, will hold a dry cleaner and a cafe with outdoor seating, according to Mr. Becker. The Wauregan will also have a new three-level parking garage.
 The apartments, which are now accepting applications, will probably house workers from the state's two casinos, Mohegan Sun and Foxwoods, which are easily the region's biggest employers, with a combined 20,000 employees. And 2,500 more jobs could be added at the $700 million conference center and hotel that was begun at Foxwoods this spring. 
 The Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, which owns Foxwoods, helped push the redevelopment of downtown Norwich with the construction of the five-story red-brick Mercantile Exchange at 55 Main Street. The Mercantile, an $18.9 million project completed in 2004, has 89,711 square feet of commercial space, both Class A office space and ground-floor retail space, although only 50 percent of the total space is leased, according to Konover Office and Commercial of West Hartford, Conn., which leases the building.
 Smaller projects in the downtown include the restoration of the Flatiron, a red-brick building that has sat empty for years, residents say, since its last tenant, a clothing store, closed. One idea includes putting restaurants and a jazz club on the lower floors and rental apartments on the upper floors, according to Mr. Davis of the planning office.
 Nearby, at 16 Franklin Street, the Thayer Building, a four-story 50,000-square-foot former office building, built in 1914, is being converted to a residential building with 29 rental apartments, with one, two or three bedrooms.
 Gary Tse, the developer, who is based in Chinatown in Manhattan, bought the building for $800,000 last June, to provide housing for Asians who want to move to the Norwich area to work in the casinos, he said. The building has a move-in date of the fall of 2007.
 The former Chelsea Landing Pub and Galley at 86 Water Street is one of the few structures surviving from the preindustrial era, when Norwich was a major shipping port for the West Indies. The 17th-century structure is being gutted by Janny Lam, a local developer who has restored other downtown buildings, to make way for an upscale restaurant, according to Mr. Kramer.
 Though outside the downtown area, Three Rivers Community College, now split between two campuses, is consolidating on its southern site, at 574 New London Turnpike, with new buildings to be paid for with a $300 million state-approved bond issue. Construction is supposed to begin in the fall. The expansion could bring more foot traffic to the downtown, city officials said.
 Restoration is also occurring in the handful of villages that are scattered throughout the river valleys near the town of Norwich, which has a population of 36,000.
 In Taftville, Onekey, a developer from the Bronx, is awaiting approval from the state to begin a $40 million project to build 302 apartments, with plans to convert them into luxury units in a few years; 489 parking spaces; and a park at Ponemah Mill, an enormous former cotton mill with two distinctive spires. 
 And in the Shipping Street district, just south of downtown Norwich on the Thames River, the city is requesting bids to turn a series of dilapidated mills on a 36-acre parcel into marinas, restaurants and a public boat launch.
 Norwich has gone after redevelopment proposals before, but never as ambitiously, and never receiving such a concerted response, according to past and present city officials. 
 ''We've had a painful adjustment here as our economy changed,'' said Art Lathrop, who served as Norwich's mayor in 2001 to 2005. ''I can't say it's quite hopping, but it's a lot better than is used to be.''

HEADLINE: Ministering To New Face Of Migrants From China

BYLINE: By CINDY CHANG

DATELINE: ALHAMBRA, Calif. 

 BODY:
Juan Du and her husband had good jobs in China. But in a country increasingly engaged in a capitalist free-for-all, they worried about being laid off. They worried too about whether their teenage daughter, faced with a fiercely competitive exam system, would get into college.
 So the family headed to the United States last year and settled in this predominantly Asian suburb east of Los Angeles, though they had no work lined up and spoke little English. 
Ms. Du then did something she had never done in China: She went to church.
 Ms. Du, who is not Christian, became a regular in the newcomers' group at the Mandarin Baptist Church, where fellow immigrants chauffeur her to appointments and, she said in Mandarin, make her feel as if she is part of a ''big family.''
 ''It's like living in a closed bottle,'' she said of finding her way in her adopted country. ''If you don't know the language, you can't figure out how to do anything.''
 Alhambra, neighboring Monterey Park and the surrounding suburbs, home to the nation's oldest and largest suburban Chinatown, were once known as Little Taipei and Chinese Beverly Hills for the Taiwan and Hong Kong natives who streamed in with enough cash to buy a house and a Mercedes.
 Now the typical newcomer arrives from an obscure corner of mainland China, well educated but with no English skills and just a few hundred dollars. Like Ms. Du, many do not even have a car.
 But they do have local Chinese churches. If a newcomer needs a ride to the hospital and an English speaker to help translate, someone from Mandarin Baptist's congregation steps forward. Newcomers are eligible for emergency grants, known as ''love gifts,'' and the church's 1,600 members are a ready source for job referrals.
 ''We welcome all sorts of people with any kind of motive,'' said the Rev. Joshua Ting, a pastor at Mandarin Baptist, a Southern Baptist congregation founded in 1963 by Chinese immigrants. ''Of course, we always challenge them to really consider seriously about faith. But we will not turn anyone away because they come in and ask for certain resources.''
 Those resources are often basic necessities. Chinese churches are filling a void left by underfinanced social service agencies, a role that American religious institutions have played for other immigrant groups for centuries.
 Mirroring the demographic shifts here, most longtime members of Mr. Ting's congregation are from Taiwan, while at the newcomers' group, business is conducted in the brogues of far-flung mainland provinces. (Ms. Du's family is from Shandong Province in eastern China, overlooking the Korean Peninsula.)
 For those who were white-collar workers -- Ms. Du was a public transit manager -- the climb to an equivalent occupation here is arduous, often requiring years of waiting tables or sewing at a garment factory while studying English in precious spare time.
 ''I didn't know English, and everything is according to ability here, so I could only do menial work,'' said Rong Chen, who earned a master's degree in mathematics in China and was a high school principal there.
 When she arrived here five years ago, Ms. Chen started on the immigrant ladder's lowest rungs, working as a live-in caretaker for the elderly. She married an American and now earns $8.50 an hour as a hospital security guard.
 The emotional toll of adjusting to a new life can be enormous, and some immigrants who never gave a second thought to religion are attracted to the surrogate families the churches provide.
 ''The church is one of the most convenient sources to look to for socializing as well as mutual aid,'' said Peter Kwong, a professor of Asian-American studies at Hunter College who is an expert on Chinese immigrants. ''A lot of people convert after they arrive.''
 An estimated 250,000 to 300,000 Chinese are in the United States illegally, according to the Pew Hispanic Center. 
 That is a small fraction of the country's 11 million or so illegal immigrants, but their problems are ever-present at a church like Mandarin Baptist, where newcomers are asked no questions about their status but sometimes confide in fellow churchgoers about it. Those who choose to be baptized are now required to take a three-month Bible course first, a condition adopted after some new converts asked for signatures on religious asylum papers, then disappeared. 
 ''A lot of them have immigration issues,'' said Frank Ho, the chairman of the newcomers' group. ''We'll pray with them and tell them it's up to God.''
 Alhambra is often just the first stop on the way to somewhere else. In a year's time, church leaders say, few of the 50 or so people who show up for the regular newcomers' sessions will still be attending the church. Some will have no more patience for sermons. Others will have moved on in search of better jobs and a cheaper cost of living.
 But the congregants persist with their good works, out of compassion and on the chance, leaders say, that they may save a soul.
 Ms. Du says she is starting to explore Christianity, though another, perhaps more pressing concern is learning English, so she can work at an office job again.
 She is unemployed, and her husband, who was a government clerk in China, is a handyman. But they look forward to something better. ''It just takes time,'' she said.

HEADLINE: A Quick Fix For The Gas Addicts

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Is there a company more dangerous to America's future than General Motors? Surely, the sooner this company gets taken over by Toyota, the better off our country will be. 
 Why? Like a crack dealer looking to keep his addicts on a tight leash, G.M. announced its ''fuel price protection program'' on May 23. If you live in Florida or California and buy certain G.M. vehicles by July 5, the company will guarantee you gasoline at a cap price of $1.99 a gallon for one year -- with no limit on mileage. Guzzle away.
As The Associated Press explained the program, each month for one year, G.M. will give customers who buy these cars ''a credit on a prepaid card based on their estimated fuel usage. Fuel usage will be calculated by the miles they drive, as recorded by OnStar, and the vehicle's fuel economy rating. G.M. will credit drivers the difference between the average price per gallon in their state and the $1.99 cap.'' Consumers won't get any credits if gas prices fall below $1.99. 
 ''This program gives consumers an opportunity to experience the highly fuel-efficient vehicles G.M. has to offer in the mid-size segment,'' Dave Borchelt, G.M.'s Southeast general manager, said in the company's official statement. Oh, really?
 Eligible vehicles in California include the 2006 and 2007 Chevrolet Tahoe and Suburban (half-ton models only), Impala and Monte Carlo sedans, G.M.C. Yukon and Yukon XL S.U.V.'s (half-ton models only), Hummer H2 and H3 S.U.V.'s, the Cadillac SRX S.U.V., and the Pontiac Grand Prix and Buick Lucerne sedans. Eligible vehicles in Florida include the 2006 and 2007 Chevrolet Impala and Monte Carlo, Pontiac Grand Prix and Buick LaCrosse.
 Let's see, the 6,400-pound Hummer H2 averages around nine miles per gallon. It really is great that G.M. is giving more Americans the opportunity to experience nine-miles-per-gallon driving. And the hulking Chevy Suburban gets around 15 miles per gallon. It will be wonderful if more Americans can experience that too -- with G.M.-subsidized gas.
 Our military is in a war on terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan with an enemy who is fueled by our gasoline purchases. So we are financing both sides in the war on terror. And what are we doing about that? Not only is GM subsidizing its gas-guzzlers, but not a single member of Congress, liberal or conservative, will stand up and demand what most of them know: that we must have some kind of gasoline tax to compel Americans to buy more fuel-efficient vehicles and to compel Detroit to make them.
 Where are the presidential aspirants on this issue? I have yet to hear John McCain, Mitt Romney, George Allen, Al Gore or Hillary Clinton support at least a $3.50 floor price for gasoline, so that it will never fall below that level and the alternatives can really flower and spread. 
 But if you go to G.M.'s Web site, here's what you will see: an ad with a young African-American boy saluting an American flag, above the following offer for U.S. military personnel: ''In appreciation of your commitment to our country, G.M. extends a $500 exclusive offer to active duty military and reserves when you purchase or lease select 2005, 2006 or 2007 G.M. cars, trucks and S.U.V.'s -- just show your military ID!''
 That's really touching. First G.M. offers a gasoline subsidy so more Americans can get hooked on nine-mile-per-gallon Hummers, and then it offers a discount to the soldiers who have to protect the oil lines to keep G.M.'s gas guzzlers guzzling. Here's a rule of thumb: The more Hummers we have on the road in America, the more military Humvees we will need in the Middle East.
 You want to do something patriotic, G.M., Ford and Daimler-Chrysler? Why don't you stop using your diminishing pools of cash to buy votes so Congress will never impose improved mileage standards? That kind of strategy is why Toyota today is worth $198.9 billion and G.M. $15.8 billion. G.M. is worth just slightly more than Harley-Davidson, the motorcycle company ($13.6 billion). 
 President Bush remarked the other day how agonizingly tough it is for a president to send young Americans to war. Yet, he's ready to do that, but he's not ready to look Detroit or Congress in the eye and demand that we put in place the fuel-efficiency legislation that will weaken the forces of theocracy and autocracy that are killing our soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan -- because it might cost Republicans votes or campaign contributions.
 This whole thing is a travesty. We can't keep asking young Americans to make the ultimate sacrifice in Iraq and Afghanistan if we as a society are not ready to make even the most minimal sacrifice to help them.

PERSON: Henry M. Paulson Jr. 

HEADLINE: Paulson Comes Full Circle

BYLINE: By LANDON THOMAS Jr.

 BODY:
Henry M. Paulson Jr. was just a few years out of business school in 1972 when he landed a coveted job on the White House staff for President Nixon. His friends at the time couldn't believe it. Yes, he had a business degree from Harvard and was also an all-Ivy tackle for Dartmouth, but, after all, he was just 26 and new to the ways of Washington.
 ''I was the top of my class at Harvard Business School and I was magna cum laude at the law school, and they picked the football player from Dartmouth,'' said Walter C. Minnick, whom Mr. Paulson beat out for the job and who is now chief executive of a landscaping company in Idaho.
''He was a bulldog, very much like a young Dick Cheney,'' said Mr. Minnick, who remains one of Mr. Paulson's closest friends. ''Hank is a salesman's salesman, and this combination of being tenacious as well as enthusiastic made him very effective.'' 
 Indeed, it was this very same blend of wide-eyed vigor and hard-edged ambition that fueled Mr. Paulson's 32 years at Goldman Sachs, pushing him to the top job of perhaps the most widely admired firm on Wall Street and leaving him with a net worth of more than $700 million. 
 A committed environmentalist and bird watcher whose brand of Republicanism recalls both the open-plains enthusiasm of Theodore Roosevelt and the pragmatism of Richard Nixon, Mr. Paulson is in some ways an executive in the mold of Paul H. O'Neill, the former Treasury secretary who was forced out by a White House that could not abide his contrarian tendencies. 
 Mr. Paulson follows Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic governor of New Jersey, who was pushed from his job as senior partner at Goldman in 1999 by Mr. Paulson and other top partners at the firm, as the latest in a long line of Goldman executives to heed the call of public service.
 Like Mr. O'Neill, Mr. Paulson has strong views on economic policies that support balanced budgets, which may not match up with the Bush administration policies that have contributed to historic budget deficits.
 Now, with the stock market showing signs of weakness and the dollar continuing to decline, the Bush administration is reaching out to a seasoned Wall Street executive to bring calm and predictability to increasingly uncertain markets.
 It was just such a role that President Clinton, desperate to bring financial gravitas to his young administration, carved out for Robert E. Rubin when he persuaded him to give up his job as senior partner at Goldman for a career in Washington. 
 Mr. Rubin preached balanced budgets and a strong dollar during a time of broad economic health, and achieved near celebrity status in the process. Now the question is, Will Mr. Paulson be able to perform a similar trick? 
 ''He is a person people have confidence in,'' said Mr. Rubin, who has spoken out against the administration's economic policies and the large deficits that they have created. ''He is a very good choice, but it's a very difficult job.'' 
 Mr. Paulson became co-chief executive of Goldman in 1998, shortly before the firm went public. He was one of the first chief executives on Wall Street to recognize the extent to which investment banks could enhance their profit by making big bets with their own capital as opposed to acting as mere intermediaries. And Goldman has had a remarkable string of strong profits. 
 But by stubbornly asserting Goldman's right to invest in, advise on and finance deals, regardless of potential conflicts, Mr. Paulson has also stirred the ire of many on Wall Street who contend that these conflicts, while mostly aboveboard and beyond regulatory approach, are sometimes too clever by half. 
 Despite his wealth, Mr. Paulson does not cultivate the airs often seen in top financiers. He prefers bird-watching in Central Park to golf and flies back as often as he can to a small farm in Barrington, Ill., located next to his parents' house, that he and his wife, Wendy, bought in 1974. 
 Mr. Paulson was born on March 28, 1946, in Palm Beach, Fla., but was brought up in Barrington. 
 At Dartmouth, he received his bachelor's degree in English in 1968 and, despite being one of the smaller tackles in the league, was named first team, all-Ivy. He finished business school in 1970 and headed to Washington, where he worked in the Pentagon before he made his move to the White House, working on John D. Ehrlichman's staff. 
 After four years of working 90-hour weeks in Washington, Mr. Paulson made his move to Goldman Sachs in 1974, starting out as a junior investment banker based in Chicago. 
 Goldman bankers who worked with Mr. Goldman speak of his dogged persistence in pursuing the region's largest companies, like Sears and Kellogg.
 ''He loved going after the big fish,'' said Robert J. Hurst, the former vice chairman of Goldman to whom Mr. Paulson once reported. ''He was very good at getting business.''
 Mr. Paulson's ability to lure big clients got the attention of Goldman's brain trust in New York, and by 1990 he had become co-head of investment banking and a member of the firm's management committee. 
 In 1999, after Mr. Corzine's departure, Mr. Paulson was the near-unanimous choice of Goldman's top partners to be the firm's chairman and sole chief executive.
 While Mr. Paulson was successful in keeping Goldman mostly free from the taint of Wall Street scandals, his rectitude has caused him and the firm a few embarrassments. 
 During the uproar over Richard A. Grasso's compensation as chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, Mr. Paulson was energetic in coming out against Mr. Grasso's package even though he was on the board that voted in support of it. If the case proceeds to trial, Mr. Paulson is expected to be a central figure.
 Goldman's role as both an investor and adviser to the New York Stock Exchange also caused a stir when the exchange merged with Archipelago. Many on Wall Street saw Goldman's many strands of influence as both unseemly and unnecessary. And Mr. Paulson's proposal to the Goldman board that the firm donate 680,000 acres of land in Chile to the Nature Conservancy elicited protests from shareholder activists who claimed Mr. Paulson was putting his own environmental passions ahead of the firm's corporate interests.
 Described by those who know him as a man who bleeds Goldman blue, Mr. Paulson, like other top partners before him, has became steeped in the culture of the firm, which places as important an emphasis on pursuing a career in public service as it does on reaping extraordinary riches. Senior partners at the firm, including Sidney J. Weinberg, John C. Whitehead, Mr. Rubin and Mr. Corzine, and more recently Stephen Friedman, all pursued careers in Washington.
 ''Sidney Weinberg made it explicit that public service was a higher calling,'' said Lisa J. Endlich, the author of ''Goldman Sachs: The Culture of Success'' (Touchstone, 2000), a history of the firm. ''It's like being a member of the Kennedy or Bush family -- it's generation after generation.''
 Like other Wall Street executives, Mr. Paulson was a generous donor during the 2004 campaign, raising at least $100,000 for the Bush campaign. Even so, despite being among a core group of Wall Street executives whom Mr. Bush called upon for advice, Mr. Paulson had, until now, spent little time alone with him.
 Early this spring when Joshua B. Bolten, a former Goldman Sachs executive, reached out to Mr. Paulson about taking the job, he was receptive, though he had his doubts about how involved his role as an economic policy maker would be, accordingto people who were involved in the discussions. By all accounts, Mr. Paulson was also having the time of his life. Goldman's stock was at an all-time high, as was Mr. Paulson's influence, as he maintained his usual full-tilt schedule, meeting with top political leaders in China, the Middle East and Europe. 
 But when the White House called again late this month and invited him to a private meeting with President Bush, Mr. Paulson began to think more seriously about the job. On May 20, a Saturday, he flew to Washington for a private meeting with President Bush, held in the White House residence. The one-on-one meeting lasted two hours, and Mr. Bolten sat in for a third hour.
 It was during this meeting that Mr. Paulson was assured that he would not be a mere salesman for the president's economic policies, but an active participant in the formulation of policy, said people who were briefed on these discussions.

HEADLINE: After $38 Million Last Year, the Pay Is Not an Issue

BYLINE: By ERIC DASH; Peter Edmonston contributed reporting for this article.

 BODY:
Henry M. Paulson Jr. took home more than $38 million last year as the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs. If the Senate confirms him as the next Treasury secretary, he will collect a mere $183,500 in annual pay -- not much more than a junior investment banker makes. 
 Not that it matters. In his 32-year career at Goldman Sachs, Mr. Paulson has accumulated a $700 million equity stake in the Wall Street firm. 
 Government ethics rules will probably force him to give up his authority over most of that vast fortune, which is far more than other Goldman Sachs executives who preceded him to Washington have accumulated. This includes Robert E. Rubin, whose net worth was less than $100 million when he gave up the Goldman chairmanship in 1993 to join the new Clinton administration.
 The huge difference between his and Mr. Paulson's $700 million net worth reflects not only Mr. Paulson's success at managing Goldman Sachs after the firm's 1999 initial public offering, but also the sheer magnitude of money paid to top executives on Wall Street today. 
 History has shown that the Treasury secretary is typically called upon to give up control of investments in companies that may present a conflict of interest. In 2001, former Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill grudgingly agreed to sell about $100 million worth of Alcoa stock and options, bowing to pressure from public watchdog groups who criticized his initial plans to retain his holdings and recuse himself from all decisions related to the company. 
 But Alcoa is an aluminum company. Shares of a securities firm such as Goldman Sachs, whose trading desks and financial tentacles stretch across the globe, would present a far more obvious conflict with the role of Treasury secretary. ''Considering how every word that man speaks affects financial markets, he can't have control of anything,'' said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonpartisan legal watchdog group. 
 Mr. Paulson, no stranger to managing conflicts of interest, is taking steps to sever financial ties before seeking Senate confirmation. ''He is expected to 'ring fence' his assets so that he will have no influence on how they are managed,'' said Lucas van Praag, a Goldman Sachs spokesman. ''He is taking independent legal advice but the determination as to what he will do has yet to be made.'' 
 Mr. van Praag said that if Mr. Paulson set up a blind trust to shield him from any knowledge about his investments, Goldman Sachs would not be the trustee. 
 Unwinding his personal fortune, however, may not be as difficult as it seems. Mr. Paulson recently set aside $100 million of Goldman stock for a family foundation dedicated to conservation and environmental education, and has said privately that he planned to give away even more of his wealth. 
 Mr. Paulson has about $630 million in Goldman stock and vested options, based on estimates from the latest regulatory filings and yesterday's $149.89 closing price. And thanks to a somewhat unusual clause in the investment bank's equity award program, stock and stock options for employees who resign to join a government agency or self-regulatory organization vest on an accelerated track, instead of being lost. The result is that Mr. Paulson would receive another $70 million in options.
 ''Does that give him a short-term windfall? Yeah,'' said Brian J. Foley, an executive compensation consultant in White Plains. ''But every month he is working as Treasury secretary, he is losing money by not working at Goldman Sachs.''
 Mr. Paulson is the latest in a long line of Goldman executives to take top jobs in Washington. In 1993, Mr. Rubin gave up his role as chairman of Goldman Sachs, then a private partnership, to join the Clinton administration as a top economic adviser. He was named Treasury secretary two years later. 
 At the time, Mr. Rubin was reported to have an estimated net worth of $50 million to $100 million. In today's dollars, that would be $65 million to $130 million. 
 To avoid potential conflicts, Mr. Rubin cut financial ties with his former firm and set up a blind trust. He then purchased a special insurance policy guaranteeing that the value of his stake would be preserved, should anything happen to Goldman. 
 Other former Goldman partners took similar measures before they began high-profile stints in Washington, including Jon S. Corzine, the former Democratic senator from New Jersey and now that state's governor. Mr. Corzine, whose $400 million Goldman Sachs fortune helped bankroll his 2000 Senate campaign, vowed to sell his remaining Goldman shares after public watchdogs suggested the equity stake conflicted with his role as a member of the Senate Banking Committee. He set up a blind trust, and through it sold all his Goldman shares by September 2005. 
 Some business leaders have taken similar steps, also sometimes under pressure, to avoid conflicts in Washington. Vice President Dick Cheney collected more than $20 million after cashing out options from Halliburton, where he served as chairman and chief executive, once his finances became an issue during the 2000 presidential campaign. John W. Snow, the former CSX chairman and chief executive, agreed to give up corporate directorships and to sell more than $20 million worth of stocks and bonds before succeeding Mr. O'Neill in February 2003.

HEADLINE: Goldman's Likely Boss Has Trader's Spirit

BYLINE: By JENNY ANDERSON

 BODY:
When Henry M. Paulson Jr., the chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs, said in 2003 that about ''15 to 20 percent'' of Goldman's employees produced 80 percent of the firm's value, he recanted almost immediately and issued a firmwide apology via voice mail. His comments were poorly received at a firm whose second business principle is ''our assets are our people.'' 
 Lloyd C. Blankfein, who is expected to be Goldman's next chief executive, seems to have a slightly different take. ''The graveyard is full of indispensable people,'' he likes to tell colleagues.
Like other Wall Street firms, Goldman Sachs has had important people come and go, but the changes at Goldman seem more intense because of the firm's emphasis on developing a culture around people. 
 Goldman has blazed a path, now being followed by others on Wall Street, by transforming itself from a traditional investment bank that offers big-name corporate clients advice on deals and capital management to a fast-growing investing giant that is willing to make big bets with its own money. 
 Goldman's growth is increasingly in trading derivatives and commodities, in servicing the ballooning class of hedge funds and private equity firms as well as managing its own hedge funds and investing in pipeline companies, toll roads and golf courses. Mr. Blankfein, 51, who has been president since 2004, has been instrumental in sharpening this focus. 
 So far, the results have been impressive: Goldman's stock has climbed from $53 on its 1999 debut to $149.83 yesterday. And the firm reported an average of $1.6 billion in quarterly profits last year. But with change, there is risk. Skeptics naturally abound and some employees and clients wonder whether the strategy is skewing Goldman's long people-focused emphasis on putting the client first.
 ''There's a trading division culture, there's an investment banking culture and an investment management culture and they are all different,'' said one former Goldman partner who spoke on condition of anonymity because he still has relations with the firm. ''The only thing that's different is that the dominant culture used to be investment banking and now the dominant culture is trading, and in the trading business, people are fungible. It's not good or bad, but it's a cultural change.''
 After 137 years as an independent firm and 7 years as a public company, Goldman Sachs exudes mystique as no other firm does. As finance has globalized and banks have completed their transformation from secretive private partnerships to still largely secretive, bureaucratic public companies, Goldman has retained its intrigue. 
 Its brand remains the uncontested leader on Wall Street and its breadth is continually reflected in the fact that it frequently experiences conflicts of interest in its deals because it operates in so many businesses in so many parts of the world. 
 Mr. Blankfein's sharp focus on results has been apparent since 2002, when the trading and principal investments division produced 52 percent of the firm's revenue and earned him a higher salary, $12.7 million, than his boss, Mr. Paulson, who made $9.6 million. 
 Mr. Blankfein cuts an unusual profile for a Wall Street chief. Raised in a housing project in the Bronx, he put himself through Harvard College and Harvard Law School on a combination of scholarships and financial aid. He took a job in a Los Angeles law firm working on tax-related issues for the film industry before detouring his legal career in 1981, joining a relatively obscure commodities trading firm, J. Aron, as a gold salesman. At the time, J. Aron had just been bought by Goldman Sachs. 
 In 1994, Mr. Blankfein was made co-head of the J. Aron Currencies and Commodities business. In 1997, the year before the markets cracked under Russia's default and the near collapse of the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, Goldman's bond trading group was merged with the J. Aron unit to create ''FICC'' -- fixed income, interest rates, currencies and commodities. Mr. Blankfein became co-head of the joint division. By 2002 he was head of all sales and trading. 
 His ascension to the presidency had obstacles: Goldman had two co-presidents, John Thain and John Thornton. But in early 2003, Mr. Thornton left to teach in China and by the end of the year, Mr. Thain accepted an offer to run the New York Stock Exchange. Mr. Blankfein was named president. 
 Unlike Mr. Paulson, who rose through the ranks of Goldman as a banker, Mr. Blankfein has his roots in sales and trading, the more rough and tumble world of Wall Street. Colleagues describe Mr. Blankfein as witty and charismatic. But investment bankers have complained that he does not spend enough time with their clients. A spokesman for Goldman called that assertion ''ridiculous.''
 Goldman has not formally appointed a successor to Mr. Paulson. Mr. Blankfein is the front-runner, according to two people close to the board, and is widely expected to take the reins by the end of the week. The board will meet later this week to consider its options, a Goldman spokesman said.
 Power is second only to money in importance on Wall Street. After the formal appointment of Mr. Blankfein, Goldman's post of president will be vacant. 
 The lineup of leading candidates reflects Mr. Blankfein's own Goldman upbringing: front-runners include Gary D. Cohn, co-head of global sales and trading and Jon Winkelried, co-head of investment banking. Other candidates include Michael Evans, also a co-head of global sales and trading as well as chairman of Goldman Sachs Asia; Michael S. Sherwood, yet another co-head of global sales and trading and co-chief executive of Goldman Sachs International, and Thomas K. Montag, co-head of global sales and trading and co-president of Goldman Sachs Japan.
 Goldman's own success has created its own conflicts, conflicts that will fall to Mr. Blankfein to manage. 
 Today, while it remains the top- ranked bank in global and American mergers and acquisitions, power within the firm has clearly shifted to trading, where revenues drive the bottom line. In 2001, investment banking produced 15 percent of revenues and trading and principal investments produced 53 percent. In 2005, investment banking produced 15 percent of the firm's net revenues, and the trading and principal investments group was responsible for 66 percent.
 That shift is partly a result of market conditions -- investment banking suffered after the technology boom ended and growth in the stock business has slowed, while low interest rates have fueled record buyouts and huge profit opportunities for banks willing to put their capital at risk. 
 But the strategy has also been decided upon by management committees willing to embrace a culture of taking more risk with its capital. In this arena, Goldman Sachs and Mr. Blankfein have paved the way. 
 Value at risk, the only available measure of risk for investors, is supposed to measure how much money could potentially be lost in trading positions because of unpredictable markets and measured by some degree of confidence. In November 2000, that figure was $25 million. In the first quarter of 2006, the average was $92 million. 
 Goldman executives say the firm takes more risk with substantially more permanent capital behind it, and emphasizes that most of the risk it takes is for its clients. 
 Perhaps the greatest challenge Goldman faces is the conflicts from its various businesses. The bank recently raised a $8.5 billion private equity fund, which it has used to bid on deals with clients, against clients and in deals in which it is advising the potential bidding group. In a series of high-profile deals in London, Goldman was leading consortiums or parts of ones making bids that appeared to be unsolicited for companies like ITV, the British broadcaster; Mitchells & Butler, and Associated British Ports.
 Soon afterward, Mr. Paulson issued a reminder to bankers that Goldman would never use its equity in a hostile deal. The results of such transactions were more than apparent in the first-quarter results. Earnings leaped 64 percent, fueled by $6.7 billion in trading and principal investments, 32 percent of total revenues. 
 The news was good, of course, but as people on Wall Street know, markets change. 
 "The environment remains very good,'' Goldman's chief financial officer, David Viniar, said the day the earnings were reported. ''As you know, I could tell you next week that it changed.''

HEADLINE: Big Sell-Off Worldwide; Dow Sheds 184 Points

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
Worries about inflation and another rise in interest rates prompted a sell-off on Wall Street yesterday, the latest dip in a market that has experienced a high degree of volatility in the last few weeks.
 ''The main thing that ails the stock market is uncertainty about the Fed and inflation,'' said Ethan Harris, chief United States economist for Lehman Brothers. ''I think the stock market is beginning to figure out that inflation is becoming a danger. Where they pretty much ignored inflation for a long time, now it's becoming an issue.''
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 184.18 points, or 1.6 percent, to 11,094.43. All 30 Dow components fell, with Caterpillar, General Motors and Merck leading the way. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 20.32 points, or 1.6 percent, to 1,259.84. The Nasdaq fell 45.63 points, or 2.1 percent, to 2,164.74. 
 Overseas markets were rattled as well. The leading market indexes in Britain, France and Germany all ended the day down more than 2 percent, with a good portion of their losses coming after stock trading began in New York. The markets in Brazil and Mexico also fell.
 Investors had little positive economic news to look to in a day of generally downbeat market activity. Oil prices rose and the dollar fell against the euro in its biggest drop in more than a month.
 Adding to the anxiety on Wall Street yesterday, Michael H. Moskow, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, expressed concerns in an interview that inflation was running a little too high. His remarks, broadcast on CNBC, raised fears that the central bank could raise interest rates for a 17th consecutive time when it meets next month. 
 One issue distressing investors, analysts said, is that they can no longer predict with any degree of certainty what the Fed will do. 
 ''The bottom line is investors don't like uncertainty,'' said Michael Pond, an interest rate strategist with Barclays Capital. ''You're entering into the first meeting in a year and a half where it's not clear whether the Fed is going to raise interest rates. But the Fed doesn't know what they're going to do, and investors should be concerned about that.''
 Analysts also point out that market downturns are symptomatic of an economy that is cooling. ''Until the stock market can feel comfortable that this is going to be a modest inflation pickup,'' Mr. Harris of Lehman said, ''investors are going to be worried. So it's understandable that there's some repricing going on.''
 Just three weeks ago, the Dow Jones industrial average looked as if it might break its record high. Since then, stocks have been moving at a volatile clip, dropping sharply, then rising, but ultimately erasing the gains made earlier in the month. The Dow is now down 4.7 percent from its closing high on May 10. 
 The fact that the Dow had been approaching a high-water mark might have scared some investors into cashing out early. 
 William Rhodes, chief investment strategist with Rhodes Analytics, said the recent decline could be chalked up to the market correcting itself. ''It certainly is a correction, and a correction that is timed against reaching that peak,'' Mr. Rhodes said. 
 ''It's natural to sit back, be cautionary and say, 'What are the things that can go wrong?' You have to make that count as you're getting ready to purchase that next share of stock.''
 Two of the nation's largest companies, Wal-Mart and General Motors, helped to drag down the market yesterday. Shares of Wal-Mart dropped $1.35, or almost 3 percent, to $48.30, after the retailer said its May sales growth would be at the low end of its expectations.
 Shares of G.M. rose last week as two Wall Street analysts raised their ratings on the automaker to buy and news media reports said G.M.'s worker buyout program was proving successful. But yesterday, G.M. stock fell $1.51, or 5 percent, to $26.57.
 In the Treasury market, the benchmark 10-year note was down 7/32, to 100 12/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 5.08 percent, from 5.05 percent Friday. 
 Following are the results of the auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills, and 13-day cash management bills:

HEADLINE: Given Party Backing, Spitzer Attacks Leadership in Albany

BYLINE: By MICHAEL COOPER and DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: BUFFALO, May 30 

 BODY:
Eliot Spitzer overwhelmingly won the backing of the state's Democratic Party here on Tuesday for his campaign for governor of New York, and pledged to confront ''the crisis of leadership'' in Albany with the same zeal he used to pursue Wall Street executives as the state's attorney general.
 ''For the last 12 years, as the economy has been transformed and the world has moved forward and our people have struggled, it is only Albany that has stood remarkably still,'' Mr. Spitzer, 46, said at the Democratic State Convention here. 
''If you have a problem, they don't have the answer,'' he continued. ''If there's a challenge to be met, they have an excuse to avoid it. If there's an extra tax dollar lying around, they'll spend it. And if there's not -- well, they'll spend that one, too.''
 Mr. Spitzer's easy victory at the convention was a foregone conclusion, and the unity it demonstrated contrasts with the disagreements among the Republicans, who begin meeting on Wednesday bitterly divided not only over their candidate for governor, but also whom to support to challenge Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton.
 For the Democrats, the only real suspense on the convention floor came in the race to succeed Mr. Spitzer as attorney general, which drew five candidates. Andrew M. Cuomo, the son of the former governor Mario M. Cuomo, made a political comeback by steamrolling his four opponents with 67 percent of the weighted vote and forcing the others to undertake cumbersome petitioning drives if they want to challenge him in a primary on Sept. 12. [Page B5.]
 Mr. Spitzer's convention victory anoints him as the party's official choice and earns him a spot on the Democratic primary ballot. He still faces a spirited challenge from the Nassau County executive, Thomas R. Suozzi, whose outsider's campaign for governor has gained little traction, judging from opinion polls. Mr. Suozzi held a small rally a few blocks from the convention hall, where he vowed to collect enough signatures to force a primary.
 Mr. Suozzi derided the official proceedings as a ''clubhouse convention'' and asked how Mr. Spitzer could be expected to reform Albany since he is a statewide elected official and has won the backing of the state's Democratic establishment. ''Albany is sticking it to us, and Eliot Spitzer is saying, 'I'm sticking with them,' '' he told the crowd, which was attracted in part by free hot dogs. ''And I'm sticking with you.''
 If their style and words were different, both men touched on many of the same themes: The need to reduce local property taxes, spend more on education, fix the moribund upstate economy, and change a culture of state government in Albany that has led to paralysis and a lack of public confidence. Mr. Spitzer's lopsided edge in the polls, though, left few inside the convention hall fearing that Mr. Suozzi would be much of a threat in September.
 The Democrats in the hall were ebullient. For the first time in 12 years, the Democratic convention had real optimism -- even a cocky assurance -- that victory in a governor's race could be within their reach. The Republican contenders trail Democrats in every poll, leading many Democrats here to predict a sweep of statewide offices in November.
 Many of the assembled Democrats seemed almost gleeful that the end is near for Gov. George E. Pataki's reign, which Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver described as a ''12-year-long plague.'' 
 Without mentioning Governor Pataki by name, Mr. Spitzer took several swipes that appeared aimed at him. ''The crowd in charge in Albany is out of touch, out of ideas and, come Jan. 1, they'll be out of time,'' he told the delegates.
 He pledged to end ''pay-to-play politics, where you do business with a politician one day and make a campaign contribution the next.'' He described the state's hundreds of public authorities, which are largely controlled by the governor, as wasteful and secretive. He called for ''no more unqualified cronies in state jobs.''
 Mr. Spitzer even wrapped up his speech with a quotation from E. B. White -- the New Yorker essayist whose New York credentials were famously questioned by Mr. Pataki after Hillary Rodham Clinton cited Mr. White in her first Senate race. 
 The Pataki administration responded to the attacks with an unusually pointed comment aimed at Mr. Spitzer and Mr. Silver.
 ''After almost eight years as Shelly Silver's silent partner in Albany, Rip Van Spitzer today awoke from his slumber to talk about ethics in government,'' said David M. Catalfamo, the governor's communications director. ''New York's top law enforcement official needs to look no further than across the convention hall and see his pal Speaker Silver for the most obvious source of concern.''
 Mr. Catalfamo went on to bring up J. Michael Boxley, a former counsel of Mr. Silver who left after pleading guilty to sexual misconduct, and Ryan S. Karben, an assemblyman who resigned this month after being accused of improperly fraternizing with male interns.
 ''From Michael Boxley to Ryan Karben, Speaker Silver routinely conducts the affairs of the Assembly majority with the secrecy of the old Kremlin and the ethics of Tammany Hall,'' he said. ''New Yorkers deserve better. Even old Rip Van Spitzer knows that.''
 Mr. Spitzer's calls for change were not restricted to the governor alone. He also said that there would be ''no more lifetime appointments to the State Legislature,'' suggesting he would try to reform the state's electoral system, which protects incumbents through gerrymandering and relatively lax fund-raising rules. 
 State Senator David A. Paterson, the Democratic minority leader, won the party's endorsement to be Mr. Spitzer's running mate. He was nominated by his father, Basil A. Paterson, who was the Democratic nominee for lieutenant governor in 1970.
 In his speech, Mr. Spitzer called for restoring the sense of opportunity that allowed his father, Bernard Spitzer, to escape the cold-water tenement where he grew up to become a wealthy real estate developer. ''I still believe that if we give everyone the same opportunity -- and see that everyone acts with integrity and plays by the same rules -- there is no limit to what we can achieve in this great state,'' he said.

HEADLINE: U.S. Accepts Draft on Iran That Omits Use of Force 

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30 

 BODY:
The Bush administration, seeking to enlist Russian support for a United Nations Security Council resolution on Iran, has agreed to language ruling out the immediate threat of military force, American and European officials said Tuesday.
 The American agreement has improved the chances that the Russians will go along with the resolution, European diplomats said.
The resolution is to call on Iran to suspend various nuclear activities that are viewed in the West as part of a clandestine weapons program, but that Iran maintains are peaceful in nature. 
 President Bush called President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, President Jacques Chirac of France and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany to press for agreement on a Security Council resolution demanding that Iran stop enriching uranium or face possible punitive action.
 Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice's office announced that Ms. Rice would fly to Vienna on Wednesday for more talks on Iran with top Russian, Chinese and European envoys. The American goal is to get an agreement on a Security Council resolution this week, for possible approval in June.
 Also being negotiated are a package of benefits in nuclear energy, economic activities and security to be offered Iran if it cooperates in ending its nuclear activities. The Europeans are to offer this package with American support, but the Bush administration has quietly expressed misgivings about some of its possible elements.
 ''I think that we could safely say at this point that we feel like we're in good shape heading into Vienna,'' Sean McCormack, the State Department spokesman, said at a department briefing. 
 He added that Ms. Rice's top aide on the issue, R. Nicholas Burns, the undersecretary of state for political affairs, had worked with his counterparts over the weekend on various disagreements. ''That list of open issues is being whittled down, being narrowed,'' Mr. McCormack said.
 For months the United States has demanded that pressure on Iran must increase through passage of a Security Council resolution under Chapter VII of the United Nations charter. This chapter invokes the Council's power to demand compliance of member countries on certain matters and threaten punishment if they refuse.
 Russia, fearing a replay of the run-up to the Iraq war in 2002 and 2003, has opposed any invocation of Chapter VII, on the ground that the United States might seize upon its approval as a justification for acting unilaterally to impose economic penalties or use military force against Iran.
 To placate the Russians, the United States has agreed to invoke only Article 41 of Chapter VII, and not the whole chapter. Article 41 makes no reference to the possible use of force, and therefore offers the Russians a means to support it.
 ''We're splitting hairs, but it keeps the process going,'' said a United Nations diplomat familiar with the negotiations, speaking anonymously because he was not authorized to discuss the talks.
 European diplomats said they were not sure whether Russia would show up in Vienna with a commitment to vote yes or to abstain from voting on the Security Council resolution. But two diplomats said it appeared that Russia did not like being seen as isolated by the United States and Europe on the matter.
 In addition, they said, Mr. Putin hopes to get the issue of a Security Council resolution resolved soon so that it does not spill into the meetings of the Group of 8 nations in Moscow in June and in St. Petersburg in July. 
 Russia is the current president of the Group of 8, a rotating position, and is hoping for successful summit talks in St. Petersburg with President Bush and other top world leaders.

HEADLINE: Bush Nominates Wall Street Chief for Treasury Job

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS and JIM RUTENBERG; Sheryl Gay Stolberg, Elisabeth Bumiller and Felicity Barringer in Washington and David Barboza in Shanghai contributed reporting for this article.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 30 

 BODY:
President Bush said Tuesday that he had chosen Henry M. Paulson Jr. of Goldman Sachs as his next Treasury secretary, a move intended to add economic star power to his administration as it tries to fight its way through a thicket of political difficulties. 
 If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Paulson would succeed John W. Snow at a time when the economy, while strong, is facing fresh challenges from high energy prices, a falling dollar and shakiness in the stock market, where the Dow Jones industrial average fell 184 points, or 1.6 percent, Tuesday. [Page C1.]
Mr. Paulson, 60, is chairman and chief executive of the Goldman Sachs Group and one of Wall Street's most highly compensated executives, with a net worth estimated at more than $700 million. He had initially rebuffed overtures about the Treasury job, which is widely viewed as having declined in influence and prestige during Mr. Bush's presidency. 
 But Mr. Bush and other officials -- eager to bring aboard someone who could potentially do for this administration what another former Goldman chief, Robert E. Rubin, did for President Bill Clinton as a senior economic adviser and as Treasury chief -- persisted. They enlisted mutual friends to persuade Mr. Paulson to accept, and had an advantage in Mr. Bush's new chief of staff, Joshua B. Bolten, a former Goldman executive. 
 The courtship included an invitation to Mr. Paulson and his wife, Wendy, to lunch at the White House last month with President Hu Jintao of China, and culminated in a weekend meeting with Mr. Bush at the White House residence two Saturdays ago. 
 Mr. Paulson formally accepted the job the next day, May 21, a fact Mr. Bush hid when asked at a news conference four days later whether he had any indication that Mr. Snow intended to leave soon.
 ''No, he has not talked to me about resignation,'' Mr. Bush replied then, resorting to what the White House acknowledged Tuesday was an artful attempt to keep the move secret.
 Mr. Paulson, whose confirmation seems assured, would bring some different views to the administration, including support for more aggressive efforts to deal with global warming than Mr. Bush has supported.
 He would also bring credibility in the financial markets at a time of huge budget and trade deficits. And he offers expertise in dealing with the rise of China, one of the biggest economic and foreign policy challenges facing the United States.
 In announcing his decision in the Rose Garden on Tuesday morning, with Mr. Snow and Mr. Paulson at his side, Mr. Bush said Mr. Paulson would serve as his ''principal adviser on the broad range of domestic and international economic issues that affect the well-being of all Americans.''
 The phrasing seemed to signal that Mr. Paulson would have top billing on an economic team that has often been overshadowed in policy making by Mr. Bush's inner circle, including Vice President Dick Cheney and Karl Rove, the president's political strategist.
 Mr. Paulson, who has supported Mr. Bush's economic policies in the past, including his tax cuts, said he had a ''keen appreciation for the role that capital markets play in driving economic growth'' and added, without being specific, that the United States had to ''take steps to maintain our competitive edge in the world.''
 Initial reaction from Capitol Hill was positive, with some Democrats joining Republicans in praising the choice of Mr. Paulson.
 Mr. Bush's announcement brought to a close a long period in which Mr. Snow had been reported to be on his way out at the Treasury. Mr. Snow, 66, a Ph.D. economist and former chairman of the CSX Corporation, was a loyal and persistent promoter of Mr. Bush's economic policy and record.
 But many administration allies, including some Republicans in Congress, had pressed the White House to bring in someone more prominent who could do a better job of communicating the economy's strength and could reassure voters of the administration's economic competence.
 Mr. Paulson is expected to face immediate international challenges. Those include increased uncertainty in global financial markets, resulting in part from the United States' huge trade imbalance and rapidly growing foreign indebtedness.
 Lately, the value of the dollar has slumped sharply against the euro and other major currencies. That trend provides a lift to American exports by making them cheaper abroad, but can also feed inflation and slow consumer spending by making imports more expensive in this country. 
 The administration has also been struggling to develop a policy for dealing with China, which is seen by many American specialists as keeping its currency undervalued to give it an advantage in global markets for its manufactured goods.
 Perhaps no Treasury secretary would bring closer ties to China than Mr. Paulson. In more than 70 trips, he has repeatedly met with top Chinese officials, including Mr. Hu. Indeed, when Mr. Hu visited the United States in 2002, Mr. Paulson joined Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York in giving him a tour of ground zero.
 Mr. Paulson's nomination drew praise from business groups, and also from at least a few prominent Democrats who have fiercely criticized Mr. Bush's tax cuts and budget deficits.
 Mr. Rubin said Mr. Bush's choice was ''well done'' and praised Mr. Paulson as ''very well respected'' and ''thoughtful.''
 Representative John M. Spratt Jr., a South Carolina Democrat, was more enthusiastic. "President Bush could not have made a stronger choice,'' Mr. Spratt declared. 
 Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, who has close ties to Wall Street, said Mr. Paulson was ''the best pick that America could have hoped for.''
 But some analysts on Wall Street were cooler. Paul Ashworth, a senior economist at Capital Economics, predicted that Mr. Paulson would not bring major policy changes and would have to grapple with underlying economic forces that include a steady decline in the value of the dollar.
 "The best he can do is try to ensure that decline continues in an orderly fashion and does not turn into a collapse,'' Mr. Ashworth wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday. 
 As recounted by administration officials and other Republicans in Washington, the interest in Mr. Paulson intensified in February, after Secretary Snow alerted officials that he intended to leave.
 Mr. Paulson's appointment is the latest in a series of White House personnel changes managed by Mr. Bolten, who took over as chief of staff in April.
 Mr. Bolten has said he wants to bring the administration's ''mojo back'' after seeing major initiatives like the overhauls of Social Security and income taxes grind to a halt.
 But Mr. Paulson was not an automatic choice. Mr. Bush, a former oil executive, has often viewed Wall Street with thinly veiled suspicion.
 Mr. Paulson is also an environmentalist who has taken positions at odds with those of the administration. He is chairman of the board of the Nature Conservancy, which strongly supported the Kyoto Protocol to reduce the production of greenhouse gases considered responsible for contributing to global warming.
 Under Mr. Paulson, Goldman Sachs released an ''environmental framework'' in which the firm acknowledged a ''scientific consensus'' that ''climate change is a reality, and that human activities are largely responsible'' for increases in greenhouse gases.
 Still, Rob Portman, a former Republican member of Congress who is now White House budget director, subtly distinguished Mr. Paulson's passion for protecting parks and wilderness areas from a broader urge to restrict economic activity for the sake of the environment or to protect endangered species.
 ''I would call him more of a conservationist,'' Mr. Portman said. ''The distinction might be that he focuses on preserving and protecting sensitive environments, sensitive land, and some of that land has endangered species in it.'' 
 Either way, Mr. Paulson has no shortage of Republican credentials.
 Though his firm's political giving has tended to lean slightly more to Democrats than Republicans, Mr. Paulson is himself a major Republican donor, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan group that tracks campaign spending.
 Of the more than $426,000 Mr. Paulson and his wife have contributed to federal candidates and political organizations since 1989, $370,000 went to Republicans. Nearly all of that was from Mr. Paulson himself (three-quarters of his wife's share went to Democrats, among them Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York.)
 Mr. Paulson, though, appears to be a relative latecomer to raising money for Mr. Bush; he apparently did not contribute at all in 2000. But the center reported that he raised more than $100,000 for the president's re-election from other donors, making him what the campaign called a Pioneer.
 He also worked in the administration of President Richard M. Nixon in the early 1970's, including as an aide on the White House Domestic Council, which reported to John D. Ehrlichman. A Republican with ties to the administration said Mr. Paulson got to know Dick Cheney then, though administration officials said Mr. Cheney did not play a leading role in recruiting him.
 A senior White House official who was granted anonymity to discuss internal personnel deliberations said Mr. Paulson was on the ''short list'' as soon as the White House began seriously searching for Mr. Snow's successor -- someone with credentials that suited the times domestically and internationally.
 Mr. Paulson, if confirmed, would immediately take the lead in negotiations with China over the valuation of its currency. 
 Speaking of Beijing's top officials, Mr. Paulson told an audience at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania last year: ''The leaders are very bright, pragmatic and aware of their problems. They have done a great job at economic reform. In my opinion, that's a better first step because, until you have economic stability, political freedom isn't going to make any difference. But I think the Chinese will loosen up on human rights and allow more political freedom.''
 Mr. Paulson's frequent trips to China have paid big dividends for Goldman Sachs, helping the firm snare some of the biggest investment banking deals of the last decade there and giving it the first direct access to Chinese investors of any Western financial institution.
 The White House official said that even as Mr. Paulson balked at overtures to come aboard, the search kept coming back to him, and Mr. Bush instructed Mr. Bolten to keep pressing him. 
 The official said that Mr. Paulson's concerns also included his family life and succession issues at Goldman. But ultimately it was the meeting with the president at the White House residence where the Bush team was able to hammer home its argument that reports of the Treasury Department's diminution were exaggerated.
 ''Sometimes it's more myth and perception than reality,'' the official said, ''and when you get briefed on the reality, it becomes reassuring.''
 Mr. Paulson accepted the job the next day.

HEADLINE: A Secretary for Troubling Times

 BODY:
President Bush's nomination of Henry Paulson Jr. to be the next Treasury secretary is a master stroke. A Wall Street investment banker for more than 30 years and head of Goldman Sachs for the past eight, Mr. Paulson will bring much-needed clout, pragmatism and credibility to the job. 
 So, for a change, the question raised by a major presidential appointment is not one of competence. Mr. Bush has even ventured outside his comfort zone in asking a heavy hitter like Mr. Paulson to join his cabinet. America will be fortunate to have someone of Mr. Paulson's caliber join the government.
The important questions are why Mr. Paulson accepted the nomination and what his willingness to serve signals about the challenges facing the economy. In the past, the administration has had trouble attracting top talent to the Treasury because its officials were expected to shill for policies that were largely based on ideology and politics, not rigorous economics and sound fiscal practices. At this point, however, Mr. Bush has more or less accomplished -- or abandoned -- his main economic goals: most of his tax cuts have been extended beyond his term, and he has ditched his ill-conceived plans to privatize Social Security and change the tax code. 
 That means Mr. Paulson will not have to advocate policies that he did not shape, and may well not see in the same stark and simplistic terms that the president does. 
 Instead, Mr. Paulson will be free to focus on America's huge imbalances in trade and international transactions. He may not have much operating room, because the best way to reduce the United States' trade deficit would be to reduce the federal budget deficit, a goal the administration and Congress are not genuinely pursuing. But in the absence of concrete progress on the budget deficit, the government must try to convince America's trading partners and international lenders that it will fix its fiscal house before the global economy forces a fix, in the form of a falling dollar, higher prices and higher interest rates.
 Because he commands international respect and is not responsible for the policies that got the country to this juncture, Mr. Paulson may be just the person to buy America some time to get back on track. If persuasion doesn't work, the consequences of unchecked global imbalances could range from a slow economic decline to rapid and severe recession. Mr. Paulson would most likely be a steady hand in those situations, as well.
