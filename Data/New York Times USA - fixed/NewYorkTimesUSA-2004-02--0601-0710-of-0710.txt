HEADLINE: A Hint of Pineapple? Not in This Lot

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial

 BODY:
WRITING in the magazine Wine last year, my friend Jancis Robinson wondered ''Whatever Happened to White Burgundy?'' Hers was a melancholy tale about the decline of what were once the finest of all white wines. And she spared no one.
 At one tasting, she said, out of 35 Austrian and French whites, seven of them Burgundies, five of the seven lowest scorers were Burgundies. The best any Burgundy did was to come in 18th. 
 Faring even worse, she wrote, were a 1997 Montrachet from Baron Thenard, a 1996 Chevalier-Montrachet from Etienne Sauzet and wines from Louis Jadot, and Domaines Leflaive and Ramonet. ''And,'' she added, ''this was an event that included mature wines.'' Burgundians often maintain their wines are tasted too young.
 In another tasting, to find a few decent Meursaults for British Airways to serve to passengers in first class, she found that 5 of the 12 submitted were indistinguishable from a much less expensive Stellenbosch, a South African chardonnay. Like all good Burgundies, these tasting wines were made from the chardonnay grape. 
 Ms. Robinson's fear is that the Burgundians may be ignoring the quality of their vineyards to turn out what she politely calls New World chardonnay with its toasty oak, tropical fruit flavors and discernible sweetness. 
 Until a month ago I would have agreed. In many instances I still do. Lately, great white Burgundy has been rare indeed; indifferent white Burgundy, some of it suspiciously Californian in style, less so. 
 But then came a couple of industry-sponsored tastings that might have restored some of Ms. Robinson's shattered illusions. They did mine. Both tastings, in New York, offered red and white Burgundies; here I will discuss only the whites.
 The first, arranged by the importer Frederick Wildman, included white Burgundies and whites from Chablis and the Maconnais, both regions technically in Burgundy but outside the legendary Cote d'Or, the heart of the Burgundy region.
 The three that interested me were 2001 whites from the producer Olivier Leflaive: a Puligny-Montrachet Champ-Gain and a Meursault-Perrieres, both premier cru, and a grand cru, Criots-Batard-Montrachet. The Chablis were from Christian Moreau; the attractive Macon wines from the Chateau Fuisse.
 The second tasting was sponsored by the importer Kobrand and featured Maison Louis Jadot wines exclusively. Kobrand and Jadot are owned by the same company. The Jadot wines, all 2002's, included a Savigny-les-Beaune, Clos des Guettes; a Beaune Bressandes; a Chassagne-Montrachet, Morgeot, Clos de la Chapelle, Domaine Magenta; a Meursault Goutte d'Or; and a Puligny-Montrachet, Les Folatieres, all of them premier crus. There was also a grand cru, a Corton-Charlemagne.
 At lunch, the white wines, again Jadots, were a 2001 Chassagne-Montrachet Village, premier cru, and a 1999 Chevalier-Montrachet, Les Demoiselles. The Leflaive 2001 wines had already been bottled. The Jadot wines were all barrel samples; they will be bottled later this year at the Jadot cellars in Beaune. 
 Even to minimally dedicated wine drinkers it should be obvious that these are not, for the most part, simple everyday wines. They are from famous, often tiny vineyards within storied Burgundy communes, as their majestic but often cumbersome pedigrees imply. Most come from vineyards with the coveted premier cru (first growth) and grand cru (great growth) designations, and they are expensive. To cite one example, the 1999 Chevalier-Montrachet lists at $200 a bottle. 
 These top-of-the-line wines are not for casual sipping. They are lean, dry and profound, and at their best offer what Remington Norman, the wine merchant and writer, calls a dimension of understated elegance and class. They virtually demand to be paired with food and are best matched with seafood and white meats. New World chardonnays, heavily oaked, often by artificial means, fruity and slightly sweet, are generally drunk as cocktails. A veteran participant at the Jadot tasting said that it was refreshing that not a single wine tasted like pineapple.
 My own favorites among the whites included the Jadot Corton-Charlemagne, at $120, with its incredible depth and elegance; the Chassagne-Montrachet Morgeot, at about $56, for its developing richness; and the lighter, pleasant Savigny-les-Beaune because, at about $33, it represented the best value in the tasting. Whether some Macon whites will come along to match it at half the price remains to be seen.
 If, as Ms. Robinson says, some Burgundians are rushing to emulate muscular chardonnays from the Napa and Barossa Valleys, there was little evidence of it. The 2001 vintage was difficult in Burgundy but good, and lucky producers made good wine. Almost everyone in Burgundy made good, if not great, wine in 2002. Just how good will be better known after everything has been in bottle for a few months. 
 To no one's surprise, prices for the 2002's will be up considerably. The most important reason lies with the 2003 vintage, just five months old. It is expected to be one of the great vintages of recent times. But it will be maddeningly small, thanks to the bizarre weather France suffered last summer.
 Then, too, the dollar is expected to weaken further against the euro. So savvy American buyers will almost certainly snap up the 2002's, anticipating difficulty getting a decent share of the 2003's. 
 But those who relish Burgundy are unaffected by the economic problems that trouble lesser mortals. As the cagey winemakers of the Cote d'Or have always known, there is never very much Burgundy around and there are enough fanatics who will pay anything to get it.
 Which, I guess, is why some of vintners might be tempted to let standards slip now and then.

HEADLINE: Upbeat McGreevey Relies On Borrowing for Budget

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 24 

 BODY:
Gov. James E. McGreevey mixed economic boosterism and a moral call to arms in announcing a new $26.26 billion state budget containing added spending for programs ranging from preschools to stem cell research.
 The budget proposal, for the 2005 fiscal year, promises money for poor children, community college students, veterans, the arts and the elderly, but it rests on continued borrowing and new taxes and fees to stay in balance. The Republicans, in the minority in both houses of the Legislature for the first time in more than a decade, denounced Mr. McGreevey's reliance on credit and predicted that the budget would force property taxes up. 
 But for a governor who has spent the past two years battling shrinking revenues and a divided State House, today's exultant budget address before a Legislature controlled by fellow Democrats was clearly a moment to savor. The governor entered to a standing ovation, paused in his delivery from time to time for the loyal applause he knew he could expect, and did not even bother to acknowledge the Republican leadership in his introductory greetings.
 In contrast to the angry and pinched language of Mr. McGreevey's past two budget messages, today's speech was part policy wonkfest celebrating the minutiae of big-state budget making, and part revival sermon extolling New Jersey's resurrected economy and the resulting opportunities for new social spending.
 ''This book reflects the conscience of our state and the collective compassion of our citizenry,'' the governor said toward the end of his 45-minute talk. He went on: ''In the past, it has reflected the tough, difficult, ugly choices of difficult times. Today, it reflects the investments of a state that has put itself back on the right track.''
 Mr. McGreevey did not mention his own bid for re-election next year, but got in his digs at the administration of President Bush, saying he would defy the imposition of the president's new prescription benefits program on New Jersey and contrasted his state's budding economic recovery to the way he sees Mr. Bush's record.
 ''While the administration in Washington has lost two million jobs,'' the governor said, ''we in new Jersey have added 40,000 since the Legislature passed my first budget.'' 
 Although the line-by-line details will not be available for at least three weeks, the budget contains gift baskets to most of the constituents who saw their programs blocked or trimmed in past years. 
 The most sustained applause came for a relatively modest $10 million program promising to pay the community college tuition of students graduating in the top 20 percent of their high school classes, apparently without regard to income. Like a similar program recently proposed by President Bush, Mr. McGreevey's tuition plan is aimed squarely at blue-collar students and their families, a pivotal voting bloc, for whom four-year colleges are often out of reach. The governor expects 9,000 students to avail themselves of the scholarships each year.
 In other social spending, Mr. McGreevey asked for money for new preschool and after-school programs, a relatively modest $70 million extra for New Jersey's public and private four-year colleges and universities, and new spending to provide cervical cancer screening and mammograms for 20,000 women lacking insurance coverage.
 The governor's office has been leaking parts of his good-news budget over the past week, and opposition among anti-abortion campaigners is already forming for perhaps the most unusual part of his budget, a 10-year, $50 million plan to create and fund a New Jersey Institute for Stem Cell Research.
 Dr. Clifton R. Lacy, commissioner of Health and Senior Services, said after the speech that the money would buttress the state's strength as a center for medical and pharmaceutical research. 
 ''It will be a magnet to attract the best and brightest researchers, not only from New Jersey but from around the world,'' he said.
 Mr. McGreevey would rely on new taxes and fees, as well as hefty borrowing, to balance his plan to appropriate $1.7 billon more than the current budget, which expires June 30.
 Besides borrowing $1.5 billion for next fiscal year's operating expenses against future revenues from a cigarette tax increase of 45 cents per pack and new surcharges on traffic offenses, the governor is asking for a 90-cent-per-month fee on cellphone users and a delay in funding future pension costs. He is also seeking to postpone until 2007 the ability of state businesses to deduct past losses against current income on their state tax returns.
 And although the governor said he would not raise taxes, his budget proposes to more than double an environmental cleanup tax on petroleum products -- to 3.1 cents a barrel, from 1.5 cents -- and make the charge retroactive to the start of 2004. New Jersey is home to immense oil refineries, and the new fee would bring in an extra $20 million a year.
 These and other measures closed the $4 billion deficit the McGreevey administration is anticipating for the 2005 fiscal year, and the Republican leadership pounced on them. State Senator Leonard Lance, the Senate minority leader and New Jersey's ranking Republican, accused the governor of avoiding hard choices since he came to office in 2002.
 ''He is still governing by papering over a deficit with credit card borrowing,'' Mr. Lance said.
 Mr. Lance was reminded that the governor specifically challenged his critics, in his speech, to ''show me'' where they would cut to avoid his stopgap measures, but Mr. Lance declined to offer specifics before the complete budget is made public, probably by mid-March.

HEADLINE: Edwards Focuses His Efforts On 3 Promising Constituencies

BYLINE: By RICK LYMAN

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Feb. 24 

 BODY:
If Senator John Edwards is to span the imposing gap separating him from Senator John Kerry, he knows he must directly appeal to every possible wavering constituency, especially those most amenable to his message of economic disparity and working-class empowerment.
 That is why he is focusing his efforts on three fertile constituencies -- Southerners, union workers and Dean supporters -- in the days before Democrats in 10 states vote for their party's presidential nominee.
 Mr. Edwards, of North Carolina, made frequent mention of his Southern roots in appearances on Tuesday in Atlanta and on Monday in Albany, Ga., and Columbus, Ga., emphasizing that he understood the concerns of ordinary people in the region. 
 ''I grew up in the rural South,'' Mr. Edwards said after an evening rally in Columbus. ''I share the values that rural Southerners share; faith, family, integrity. Those are the things I've believed in all my life, the things I've been standing up for. We have somebody like me at the top of the ticket, we can do very well.''
In New York and Ohio on Sunday and New York on Monday, Mr. Edwards met with several groups of union workers and told them that his campaign was ''about working families,'' in hopes of overriding the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s endorsement of Mr. Kerry of Massachusetts by going directly to the rank and file.
 And last weekend, Mr. Edwards collected endorsements from Dr. Dean's former Ohio coordinator and two co-founders of Generation Dean, the campaign's youth group. 
 In each case, his method was the same: to assure voters that he not only felt their pain, as Bill Clinton had famously proclaimed, but that he had also lived through it and shared their dreams and hopes. 
 ''I'm reaching out directly to households of workers and union members,'' he told reporters on Sunday after a union rally in Rochester. ''They'll respond because I come from the same place they do.''
 The goal, Mr. Edwards said, is to give voters ''a president who understands their life at a personal level,'' which his campaign strategists consider a major difference between him and the patrician Mr. Kerry.
 To Dean backers, he casts himself as a fellow Washington outsider, as against Mr. Kerry's insider. To union workers, he is an up-from-the-mills crusader who remembers his roots. To Southerners, he is one of the boys.
 ''I have lived with this myself,'' Mr. Edwards told Norma Mulligan, one of a circle of textile workers who were handpicked by his campaign to question the candidate before television cameras in a Manhattan union hall Monday morning. 
 Ms. Mulligan had asked about paying for college, and his response was to recall having discussions on that very topic with his own parents. ''I can remember how we would sit around the table and figure out how in the world we were going make it,'' Mr. Edwards said.
 Mr. Edwards has no time to lose. In seven days, on Super Tuesday, 1,151 delegates are at stake, more than half the 2,159 delegates needed to win the nomination and Mr. Edwards is far behind Mr. Kerry in every measure. 
 Polls in the most populous states have not been encouraging. A Los Angeles Times poll of 506 likely Democratic primary voters in California showed on Tuesday Mr. Kerry ahead by 56 percent to 24 percent. A Marist College poll of New York voters showed an even wider spread last week. 
 Mr. Edwards has insisted he will close the gap in the final days, just as he did in South Carolina and almost did in a surprising second-place finish in Wisconsin a week ago. 
 ''We've got to start changing the momentum,'' Mr. Edwards told reporters on Monday after a rally in Columbus, Ga. ''We have big primaries on Tuesday. We need to do well in a group of those, and I think we have some great opportunities. Minnesota, for example. Georgia. Ohio. And we'll compete very hard in New York and California. And then, the following week, we need to continue that momentum by doing well in a group of states I am naturally strong in: Florida, Mississippi and Louisiana.'' 
 In another indication that he may be looking beyond Super Tuesday, Mr. Edwards flew on Tuesday to the fourth state that votes on March 9, Texas, appearing at a fund-raiser in Houston and a local high school.
 The policy proposals that Mr. Edwards offers up union audiences -- new regulations making it easier to organize, a streamlining of ''the bureaucratic maze,'' college tax credits, a significant increase in the minimum wage -- seems secondary at times to his persistent desire to convince them that he understands exactly what they are feeling.
 When Omar Alexander told the senator about losing his job after 34 years, Mr. Edwards told him the story that he has used almost daily on the campaign trail. ''What you are describing is something I have seen over and over and over,'' Mr. Edwards said. ''In fact, my father worked in a mill and I saw what happened to the families involved when the mill in my hometown closed. And, you know, this is something that crowd in Washington just doesn't get.''
 But he did more than witness that mill's closing, Mr. Edwards said. He absorbed the emotions of the people who went through it. ''People don't understand, it's not just a paycheck for you,'' he said. ''It has some effect on your self-respect and dignity. I hear that and I see it in your face, and I hear the same thing over and over and over across this country.''
 Two of Mr. Edwards's union rallies -- Sunday in Rochester and Monday in New York -- were sponsored by Unite, the textile workers union that has been the only labor union to endorse him. But to really make inroads with union families, Mr. Edwards will have to appeal to those represented by the dozens of A.F.L.-C.I.O. unions whose leaders have endorsed Mr. Kerry.
 On Sunday in Niles, Ohio, a small city not far from Youngstown, Mr. Edwards appeared before a few hundred steelworkers who have been locked out of a local titanium factory since October.
 Jim Beal, who has worked at the plant for 14 years and lives in nearby Poland, Ohio, said it made no difference to him that union leaders had backed Mr. Kerry. ''They're more interested in winning than they are in the right person for the job,'' he said.

HEADLINE: An environmental group's depiction of Ford's chief exposes hostilities between onetime allies.

BYLINE: By Fara Warner

 BODY:
STUNG by the depiction of its chairman and chief executive as Pinocchio in an advertisement, the Ford Motor Company has sent a cease-and-desist letter to an environmental group responsible for the ad. 
 Ford is demanding that the group, Bluewater Network, which is based in San Francisco, stop ''unlawful conduct'' in a print and Internet campaign that attacks Ford's environmental policies. 
 Bluewater began running an ad in national and college publications earlier this month that said William Clay Ford Jr., the company's chairman and chief executive, had failed to make good on a promise the company made in 2000 to increase the fuel efficiency of its sport utility vehicles 25 percent by 2005.
 The ad features a line drawing of Mr. Ford with an extra-long nose and the words: ''Bill Ford Jr. or Pinocchio? Don't buy his environmental rhetoric. Don't buy his cars.'' 
 Ford's letter, sent by the law firm Kirkland & Ellis in Washington, says that Bluewater Network's campaign violates several laws. 
 The company contends that Bluewater is unlawfully using Ford's blue oval trademark on its Web site and that Bluewater has orchestrated a telephone call-in campaign to Mr. Ford's office that could be considered harassment.
 The director of Bluewater, Russell Long, said that the group had provided Mr. Ford's number to its organizers on college campuses but that it was given only to individuals who wanted to express their opinions and was never printed or posted on the group's Web site.
 The letter does not demand that the group stop its campaign, and a Ford spokesman, Jim Vella, said the company understood the right of groups to make their opinions known.
 But the letter does make clear what the company's position is on the caricature of Mr. Ford. ''Your personal attacks on Mr. Ford are gratuitous and offensive, well beyond the scope of responsible and civil public dialogue, and strong evidence that you made the misrepresentations with malice,'' the letter reads. ''We know you understand the seriousness of falsely and maliciously maligning the men and women of Ford Motor Company.''
 Mr. Long said that he had discussed the letter with his lawyers and would continue with the campaign despite what he called ''Ford's intimidation tactics.''
 This recent dispute highlights the divide between environmental groups and Mr. Ford, whom they once considered an ally. It also reflects a growing difference of opinion among environmental groups on what tactics will work to force the industry to build cleaner and more fuel efficient vehicles. 
 In 2000, Mr. Ford pledged that the company, which was founded by his great-grandfather, would increase the fuel economy of its sport utility vehicles by 25 percent over five years. General Motors and DaimlerChrysler made the same pledge soon afterward. ''When Bill Ford made his announcement, it was a golden moment,'' Mr. Long said. ''We had found a single company willing to be a change agent.''
 But Mr. Long said that after three years Mr. Ford had done little to make good on his promise and had undermined legislation drafted by Senators John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, that would have doubled the industry's overall fuel economy to 36 miles a gallon by 2015. 
 Federal regulations require the auto industry to meet a corporate average fuel economy of 27.5 miles a gallon for its cars and 20.7 miles a gallon for its light trucks. Under revised regulations, light trucks must meet a standard of 22.2 miles a gallon by the 2007 model year. 
 Ford acknowledged in its corporate citizenship report last July that it had not met its promise to increase the fuel efficiency of its S.U.V.'s by 25 percent. In a letter included in the report, Mr. Ford wrote that the company was unable to make the investments in technologies needed to meet his goal. Since he became both chairman and chief executive in 2001, the company has grappled with declining revenue and market share.
 But the company did note that the fuel efficiency of its S.U.V. fleet increased 5.2 percent in 2003; in 2002, its sport utilities were 8.4 percent more efficient than those in 2000. The company also points to the introduction of a hybrid electric version of the Ford Escape, a small S.U.V., as a sign that it continues to work on environmental initiatives. 
 Despite those explanations, several environmental groups have become disenchanted with the man and company they once thought would help compel Congress to increase fuel-economy regulations, which remained virtually unchanged through the 1990's.
 They are, however, taking different, less adversarial tactics than Bluewater Network.
 Last year, the Sierra Club ran ads during Ford's 100th anniversary celebrations depicting the company as a laggard in innovation. The ads featured innovations like the iPod music player that have replaced old technologies like the wind-up phonograph. Then it showed a Ford Model T, which got 25 miles a gallon, compared with the Ford Explorer, which gets 16 miles a gallon. 
 But the Sierra Club declined to sign on to Bluewater's Pinocchio ad, which was supported by Greenpeace and Public Citizen of California, among other groups. 
 ''It wasn't our message,'' said Dan Becker, a global warming expert with the Sierra Club, which has 700,000 members. ''We didn't want to be associated with it.'' 
 Mr. Long, a former America's Cup skipper, founded Bluewater Network eight years ago. It now has about 20,000 members and ''e-activists,'' or people who have signed up online, and a budget of about $1 million, he said. 
 The group has been active in the battles to ban snowmobiles and personal water craft from national parks. It also sponsored legislation in California to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from cars and trucks by 2009. The legislation was passed in 2002, but regulations on how to achieve the reductions will not be settled until 2005.
 Although Mr. Long said he respected the tactics of other groups, he said environmental advocates had to take some responsibility for the lack of progress in increasing the auto industry's fuel efficiency.
 ''Environmental groups have been ineffective,'' he said. ''Despite spending millions of dollars in this battle, we've failed.''

HEADLINE: Home Sales Declined 5.2% in January

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Sales of existing homes in the United States fell 5.2 percent in January, as housing activity settled after reaching record levels in 2003, a report by the National Association of Realtors showed yesterday. 
 Sales of previously owned homes slid to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6.04 million units, from a revised 6.37 million rate in December, the real estate group said. 
 Analysts polled by Reuters had been expecting a 6.28 million unit rate. 
 ''The housing markets are healthy, very healthy, and all of these drop-offs are expected,'' said David Lereah, chief economist of the association. He added that some of the decline could be attributed to harsher-than-usual winter weather in the north. 
 Sales of existing homes rose to a record 6.1 million in 2003 as mortgage interest rates hovered near lows not seen since the early 1960's. 
 Inventories shrank in January by 4.3 percent compared with the previous month, to a total of 2.2 million homes available for sale, or a 4.4 months' supply at the current sales pace. 
 The median pre-owned home sales price jumped 5.4 percent from the same month a year ago, to $168,700.

HEADLINE: Surge in Cost of Metal Squeezes Pricing and Profits

BYLINE: By BERNARD SIMON

 BODY:
Like many businesses that use steel, copper and other metals in their products, Mary Jane Gilbert's roofing-materials company in Phoenix is in a fix.
 Ms. Gilbert, the joint owner of JB Roofing, sells to home builders, and she has quoted firm prices for roofs on more than 500 homes that her customers have sold but not yet built. 
 But in the weeks since she committed herself to those deals, Ms. Gilbert's suppliers have notified her of price increases of 10 percent to 20 percent on metal roofing components like valleys, edges and vents, and they say that another increase is likely in April. 
 With the selling price of the house already fixed, it is too late to pass along those increases. ''We're caught in the middle,'' Ms. Gilbert said. ''The builder is also caught in the middle.''
 Though analysts do not expect the recent spurt in the prices of raw and some processed materials to have much immediate effect on overall inflation, the increases are a big headache for businesses like Ms. Gilbert's. 
 ''Everybody who buys a steel part is impacted,'' said Charles Hageman, executive director of the Forging Industry Association, a trade group in Cleveland. 
 Ana Lopes, director of government relations at the Motor and Equipment Manufacturers Association in Research Triangle Park, N.C., said, ''This is something that has come about very quickly, and with great force.'' Ms. Lopes's group speaks for the auto parts industry, a big user of steel and other metal. 
 In the home construction industry, ''more homes are being sold before materials are purchased so builders are taking a risk,'' said Michael Carliner, chief economist at the National Association of Home Builders in Washington. 
 That risk has become larger. The price of copper -- used in electric cables, plumbing and a variety of other industrial and construction applications -- soared to an eight-year high of nearly $3,000 a metric ton on the London Metal Exchange last week, almost twice the level in June. Nickel, used in stainless steel, has more than doubled in the last year. 
 Other commodities, like coal and iron ore used in steel making and lumber for home construction, have also risen sharply; so has steel scrap, an alternative material for steel making. 
 According to American Metal Market, a trade publication, the price of hot-rolled steel, one of the most widely used types, has soared by more than 80 percent in the last year, and by almost half since December; it now sells for about $480 a ton. Many steel makers have also begun to impose surcharges, typically around $40 a ton, because of the high prices of their raw material. 
 And they are becoming increasingly reluctant to quote prices for future delivery, Mr. Hageman said, adding that with domestic demand picking up, ''this is just the wrong kind of news.'' 
 ''Just when you need more steel,'' Mr. Hageman said, ''the supply is cut short.''
 His association and several steel manufacturers have asked the Commerce Department to consider limiting American exports of steel scrap in hope that increasing the amount of scrap available to domestic mills will help moderate price increases on new steel. 
 Analysts ascribe the upward pressure on the price of materials to surging demand in China, abetted by a pickup in economic growth in the United States and by the weakness of the dollar. International metal prices are typically set in dollars, and foreign producers must raise dollar prices to cover their costs when the currency weakens. 
 In the case of some metals, notably nickel, a lack of investment in new production capacity has also limited supplies. 
 The jump in metals prices is hurting some businesses and consumers more than others. Mark Lynskey, chief executive of the American Bicycle Group in Chattanooga, Tenn., said that retail prices of his company's bikes, made mostly from titanium, aluminum and carbon fiber, an oil-based material, are likely to rise by about 20 percent. 
 ''Short term, we may have to absorb some of the increases,'' Mr. Lynskey said. ''But in the long term, it will have to pass through to the consumer.'' 
 Mr. Lynskey said that the recent step-up in military procurement had increased demand for titanium to the point that his company must now wait eight or nine months for delivery on an order instead of the usual three months. ''It's making manufacturing scheduling very difficult,'' he said.
 By contrast, many makers of auto parts and home appliances are finding that, like Ms. Gilbert's roofing-supply company, they have little if any ability to compensate for higher metal costs with price increases. Ms. Lopes of the auto parts industry group, citing intense global competition and long-term contracts with vehicle manufacturers, said her association's members ''are almost always not able to pass on these costs.'' 
 That helps explain why analysts do not expect surging metal prices to show up in retail inflation data, at least for now. The Consumer Price Index in January was just 1.9 percent higher than a year earlier, and most of the index's 0.5 percent month-to-month increase in January was attributed to energy costs. 
 John Mothersole of Global Insight, an economic consulting firm in Washington, said that the surge in commodity prices was typical of the early stages of an economic recovery. ''Very little is passed on to final consumers,'' Mr. Mothersole said, ''because producers are very cognizant of what large price increases will do to their market.'' 
 He estimated that only about 10 percent of a movement in commodity prices made its way into manufacturers' prices for finished goods, and less than 3 percent into retail prices. Instead, many American manufacturers find ways to blunt the effect of rising raw-material prices, often through the improved productivity of their workers and by holding down other costs.
 Sharply rising prices also encourage producers to step up output, and users to switch to less expensive substitutes. Recently, several copper mines in Chile and elsewhere have reopened facilities and begun releasing metal from stockpiles they built up when the market was in the doldrums. 
 Likewise, some stainless-steel makers have begun to use more chromium and manganese and less nickel. 
 Craig Yarde, purchasing manager of Yarde Metals in Southington, Conn., whose customers include aerospace and semiconductor manufacturers, said the run-up in prices had benefited his company by increasing the market value of the 40 million pounds of metal in its inventory, mostly aluminum and stainless steel. 
 Still, as Mr. Yarde and many others see the present situation, ''it's not good when it runs up this fast and this quick, because it can come down this fast and this quick.''

HEADLINE: A case study in free trade: American incomes converge, but not at the bottom.

BYLINE: By Virginia Postrel. 
Virginia Postrel is the author of '''The Substance of Style: How the Rise of Aesthetic Value Is Remaking Commerce, Culture and Consciousness'' (HarperCollins).

 BODY:
SUPPOSE we lived in an economic world with no borders, where goods, capital and people could move anywhere.
 We've all heard the dire predictions of what would happen. All the businesses and jobs would rush to the places with the lowest wages. The poor countries would get richer, but only by making rich countries poorer. 
 Eventually we'd all be roughly equal, but formerly well-to-do Americans would be a lot worse off. Many Americans are afraid that globalization and free trade will have exactly this effect.
 We rarely realize that we already live in a version of that theoretical world. The United States is one giant free trade zone. Businesses can move their plants, investors can move their money and workers can move themselves from region to region without government permission.
 Over the last century, a lot of that movement has occurred. Rich and poor regions have converged to about the same standard of living. But the results haven't been anything like the ''race to the bottom'' of protectionist imaginations.
 Incomes still vary widely across regions. Income per capita in Connecticut, the richest state, was about $42,000 in 2002, compared with $24,000 in New Mexico, the poorest. (These figures aren't adjusted for price variations between regions.)
 Today's differences are small, however, compared with the huge differences that used to exist. A century ago, the poor states were like third world countries compared with the richest states. They've caught up only since 1960.
 Adjusted for regional price differences, income per worker in the South was just two-thirds of the country's average as recently as 1940, according to calculations by two economists, Kris James Mitchener and Ian W. McLean, reported in The Journal of Economic History. 
 The disparity was even greater in the late 19th century.
 Over the last half-century, ''once-poorer states have been growing faster than richer ones,'' says Professor Mitchener of Santa Clara University in California. ''That's going to cause the poor ones to catch up to the richer ones.'' But, he adds, that doesn't mean impoverishing the rich ones.
 In fact, states like New York, California, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts have remained at the top of the list for more than a century. They've kept growing, though at a slower rate than poorer states. The most dramatic improvement has been in Florida, which was among the poorest states in 1880 and among the richest a century later.
 There are two ways a region can raise its income per capita. One is simply to have more people doing paid labor. The other is to increase productivity -- output per worker or per hour worked.
 In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Western mining states like Nevada had the highest per capita incomes, because most of the population was working.
 ''Mining attracted young males,'' Professor Mitchener explains. ''Those young males didn't bring many wives with them at first, and they didn't have many children, and they worked till they died.''
 That demographic lift can't last forever, but it can help economic growth start. In East Asia, he notes, there was a huge influx of people into the paid labor force in the second half of the 20th century. The increase in labor force participation helped propel economic growth. Over time, productivity per worker also improved.
 In the United States, the Western states became more like the rest of the country after 1940. For those on the Pacific coast, notably California, the lift from mining carried on into continued economic development. Those states remained among the richest in the country. Once mining petered out, less accessible states like Montana fell behind the national average.
 Over the long term, increasing productivity is more important and sustainable than just getting more people to work. And that is where the real changes have occurred among this nation's regions.
 ''In 1880 the United States was poised to overtake Britain as the most efficient industrial economy and become the century-long benchmark against which all other economies' productivity performance would be compared. Yet in that year, labor productivity in the least productive state (North Carolina) was a mere 18 percent of the most productive (Nevada),'' wrote Professor Mitchener and Professor McLean of the University of Adelaide in Australia in a more recent study in The Journal of Economic Growth.
 That extraordinary difference cannot be attributed to Nevada's mining efficiency alone. North Carolina's productivity was only about 24 percent of California's or New York's. These gaps are comparable to the difference between the United States and Thailand or Morocco today.
 Today, North Carolina is still poorer than California or New York, but the difference is much smaller. The free movement of goods, investment capital and labor has in fact helped to equalize regions within the United States -- and, at the same time, to make the whole economy more prosperous by spurring productivity.
 Very low productivity means there's more room for investments to pay off by significantly increasing output. In the second half of the 20th century, the South did attract investment from the richer parts of the country. Workers got better training and equipment, and the Southern states began to catch up. Incomes went up faster in the poor regions, but they continued to rise in the rest of the country.
 But even in a free trade region like the United States, different legal institutions matter. Most of the South's improvement occurred after 1960, around the time the civil rights movement ended official segregation. Jim Crow laws had hurt the region's productivity, Professor Mitchener suggests, by limiting the ability of black Southerners to build skills and savings.
 ''There are still differences out there, but those differences have fallen significantly -- and not at the expense of rich states,'' Professor Mitchener says. ''The poorer states have caught up. The pie isn't a fixed pie.''

HEADLINE: Fitch Raises Credit Rating of Hasbro

BYLINE: Bloomberg News

 BODY:
The credit rating of Hasbro Inc., the toymaker, was raised to investment grade yesterday by Fitch Ratings after the company lowered debt and increased profit and sales. The increase, to BBB- from BB+, affects about $700 million in debt, Fitch said. Hasbro's focus on its classic brands such as Transformers and G.I. Joe, instead of relying on hit items like Pokemon, has paid off, Fitch said. The company, which is based in Pawtucket, R.I., also trimmed costs and pared debt by $369 million last year, the rating company said.

 BODY:
The brewer Heineken reported that 2003 profit was unchanged at 798 million euros ($997 million) and warned investors that a weak dollar was likely to hurt results this year. Sales, however, were up 9.7 percent, to 9.3 billion euros from 8.4 billion euros in 2002. Sales in the United States were up only 2.2 percent from 2002, in large part because of the weak dollar, an uncertain economic climate, the war in Iraq and a temperate summer in the Northeast. Heineken said it did manage, however, to gain some market share in the United States. Gregory Crouch (NYT)

HEADLINE: Decline Seen In Science Applications From Overseas

BYLINE: By DIANA JEAN SCHEMO

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
Bucking a trend that dates to the end of World War II, the number of foreign students applying to graduate and doctoral programs in science at American universities is declining broadly, according to a survey of 130 such programs released here today.
 The findings came as the General Accounting Office, the investigative arm of Congress, reported that foreign students and scholars hoping to study science or certain technologies at universities in the United States must wait an average of 67 days to receive a visa. For some of them, the delays extend up to a year, the report said.
 ''It's really what we've been fearing all along,'' said Vic Johnson, associate director for public policy at the Association of International Educators. ''It's the accumulation of a lot of things that is just causing a change in the attractiveness of the United States as a destination for students and scholars.'' 
 The General Accounting Office study said the nation's system for issuing visas for research in sensitive areas was unnecessarily slow and cumbersome. 
 For example, it said, while the State Department, the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security are all involved in researching candidates for visas, the three agencies do not have data systems that can work with each other. In addition, the report said, it takes the State Department two weeks just to notify consular officials abroad once it has cleared a candidate to receive a visa.
 ''Everyone has to be willing to put up with more delays and bureaucracy in the post-Sept. 11 world,'' Representative Sherwood Boehlert, the New York Republican who is chairman of the House Committee on Science, said at a hearing on the report today. ''But we still have an obligation to ensure that we are not needlessly alienating scholars from around the world who could help this nation, and that we are not unnecessarily hamstringing or burdening our universities and research centers.''
 Administration officials said they recognized the need for greater cooperation, and were taking steps to reduce the delays. Asa Hutchinson, under secretary for border and transportation security at the Department of Homeland Security, said the administration's goal was to ''remain a welcoming nation to foreign scholars and scientists and not compromise security requirements.''
 Some 586,000 overseas students enrolled in American universities last year, and organizations representing international students estimate they contribute more than $11 billion to the United States economy. After the Sept. 11 attacks exposed a visa system in disarray, Congress ordered an overhaul. It increased scrutiny of foreign students, particularly those from countries deemed to pose a risk to the United States, and imposed new restrictions on students of science and technology that could be used in making weapons. 
 The tougher screening has drawn criticism from some scholars. Giorgio Agamben, an Italian professor of philosophy and political theory, chose not to teach a seminar at New York University, saying he could not accept the use of finger and retinal printing or other biometric scrutiny of visitors, like subcutaneous tattooing.
 Catharine R. Stimpson, dean of the graduate school of arts and science at N.Y.U., said the effects of the tougher visa procedures were seen largely in the sciences. Applications from Chinese students, she said, were down 50 percent this year. ''That's 400 students,'' she said.
 The survey of universities, done by Mr. Johnson's organization and others representing institutions of higher education, found that 59 percent of some 130 research universities and doctoral programs were seeing declines in applications from overseas students, while 28 percent said the number of foreign applications showed no significant changes. About 11 percent said they saw an increase.
 The survey also polled the 25 research and doctoral institutions that enroll the most foreign students. Nineteen responded, all saying their foreign applications were down, most by more than 10 percent.

HEADLINE: To Trim Deficit, Greenspan Urges Social Security and Medicare Cuts

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, told lawmakers on Wednesday that Congress should rein in the federal deficit through reductions in spending -- including cuts in entitlement programs like Social Security -- rather than through tax increases.
 ''The crucial issue out here is the rate of growth of productivity and the rate of growth of the economy, and what history does tell us is that keeping tax rates down will tend to maximize that,'' Mr. Greenspan told members of the House Budget Committee.
 That was music to the ears of President Bush and many Republicans, who want to extend permanently more than $1.7 trillion worth of tax cuts even as they face a deficit that could exceed $500 billion this year. 
 But Mr. Greenspan touched off a furor by calling on Congress to trim Social Security and Medicare benefits in the future, provoking criticism from Democrats and causing heartburn among some Republicans.
 Echoing the views of many budget experts, Mr. Greenspan warned that the real fiscal calamity is not this year's deficit but the soaring entitlement costs that will come when the baby boom generation begins to reach retirement age.
 ''I believe that a thorough review of our spending commitments -- and at least some adjustment in those commitments -- is necessary for prudent policy,'' Mr. Greenspan said. 
 Though President Bush has also called for a fundamental overhaul of Social Security and Medicare, Mr. Greenspan was far more explicit and called for raising the retirement age above 67 and slowing the rate at which benefits are adjusted for inflation. 
 Mr. Greenspan has voiced the same ideas before, as recently as two weeks ago, but with an election looming, his comments on Wednesday provoked a much more widespread reaction.
 Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, declared ''the wrong way to cut the deficit is to cut Social Security benefits.'' 
 Senator John Edwards of North Carolina, Mr. Kerry's top rival, called Mr. Greenspan's remarks ''an outrage.''
 President Bush, asked about Mr. Greenspan's testimony, responded cautiously.
 ''I need to see exactly what he said,'' Mr. Bush told reporters during a brief news conference with the new president of Georgia. ''My position on Social Security benefits is this: those benefits should not be changed for people at or near retirement.''
 That was consistent with Mr. Greenspan, who emphasized that any changes in the law should take place years in advance of changes in benefits.
 But Mr. Bush and other Republicans have refrained from any discussion about cutbacks in Social Security or Medicare benefits, a politically explosive topic for the growing number of elderly voters and never more so than in an election year.
 ''Those proposals are not the right answer,'' said Representative E. Clay Shaw Jr., Republican of Florida and chairman of a House subcommittee on Social Security. ''There is a viable alternative that doesn't require tax increases or benefit cuts. Allow workers to save today through voluntary personal accounts that back Social Security with real assets.''
 Most budget analysts, Democrats and Republicans alike, agree that Medicare and Social Security costs are set to soar as soon as the baby boomers begin to reach retirement age at the end of this decade. The gap between those looming obligations and the money accumulating in trust funds to cover them has been widely estimated at tens of trillions of dollars over the next 75 years.
 Mr. Greenspan was in many ways reflecting a widespread view that the only solution is to either cut benefits or raise taxes by huge amounts. But that is a conclusion that neither party in Congress has been ready to face thus far.
 On the more imminent political battle over next year's budget and the outlook for President Bush's tax cuts, Mr. Greenspan displayed his penchant for offering something to almost everybody.
 He staunchly defended Mr. Bush's tax cuts, even though the cost of making them permanent would increase the federal debt by about $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years.
 But he once again parted ways with Mr. Bush on the question of how to pay for those tax cuts, calling for Congress to make the tax cuts permanent only if it also adopted rules that would require it to offset the loss in revenue with spending cuts or tax increases in other areas.
 That approach contrasts sharply with Mr. Bush's proposal, which would require Congress to offset only new increases in spending with cuts in other programs.
 The White House anticipates a shortfall of $521 billion this year, and the administration contends that it can reduce the deficit by half over the next five years by cutting back on nonmilitary domestic spending.
 Many outside analysts say the administration's plan is unrealistic because it omits the costs of many of Mr. Bush's own priorities. For instance, making the tax cuts permanent would cost more than $1.5 trillion over the next 10 years, but most of the revenue losses would not show up until after 2009.
 Senate leaders hope to start work next week on a budget resolution that will set the overall framework for both spending and tax legislation.

HEADLINE: Economics Adviser Learns the Principles of Politics

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
Having risen almost effortlessly as a professor of economics at Harvard, N. Gregory Mankiw is now getting an education in full-contact politics.
 Mr. Mankiw, a lanky man with a boyish demeanor and soft-spoken style, is chairman of President Bush's Council of Economic Advisers. Three times in the last two weeks, he has found himself at the center of a firestorm on an issue of enormous political importance to the administration: jobs. 
 First he drew fire from both Republicans and Democrats for saying that outsourcing jobs to foreign countries was simply another form of free trade that would ultimately be a ''plus'' for the United States. 
 Even before that tempest abated, Mr. Mankiw (pronounced man-CUE) had to stand by while President Bush and Treasury Secretary John W. Snow scrambled to distance themselves from a forecast by the council that the nation would add 2.6 million jobs this year.
 Late-night comedians, meanwhile, lampooned Mr. Mankiw for suggesting in that same economic report that flipping hamburgers at a McDonald's might constitute a form of manufacturing. The punch lines glossed over the report's point, which was not to promote reclassifying fast food as manufacturing but to point out that official classifications are vague enough that many service companies could qualify for tax breaks aimed at manufacturers.
 A senior White House official said last week that Mr. Mankiw still had President Bush's full support. But administration officials said the same thing about Lawrence B. Lindsey, who was fired as head of Mr. Bush's National Economic Council in December 2002. Mr. Lindsey was unwaveringly loyal to Mr. Bush's agenda, but he infuriated White House officials by suggesting -- accurately, as it turned out -- that the cost of a war in Iraq might hit $200 billion.
 To Mr. Mankiw's critics, it did not matter that his comments about outsourcing echoed the views of many sophisticated economic observers, from Democrats like Robert B. Reich, the former labor secretary, to Republicans like Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve.
 What mattered to the White House and to Republicans in Congress was that Mr. Mankiw seemed to condone the export of American jobs to low-wage countries like China and India -- thereby opening President Bush to attack that he shared such views. 
 Mr. Mankiw, who lives during the week in a Washington hotel and commutes on weekends to be with his wife and three children in Wellesley, Mass., is trying to fight off an image as both a cold-hearted apologist for corporate outsourcing and an Ivy League academic who knows too little of the real world.
 Mr. Mankiw, 46, is indeed an Ivy League academic and is scheduled to return to Harvard by September 2005. He is wealthier than many professors, mainly by virtue of his best-selling college economics textbook.
 He describes himself as a lifelong Republican, which sets him apart from many Harvard colleagues. He distributed campaign literature for Richard Nixon in the early 1970's, and he grew up in Cranford, a fairly affluent suburb in New Jersey, the son of an engineer and a teacher. He drives a BMW 330i and a Honda S.U.V. He does not ''buy American'' for the sake of American jobs, and he is emphatic in his belief that free trade ultimately benefits everybody.
 Still, Mr. Mankiw has not been an orthodox Republican. In the first edition of ''Principles of Economics,'' his basic textbook, he ridiculed the supply-side tax policies of President Ronald Reagan as the work of ''charlatans and cranks.''
 In 1999, in an article for Fortune magazine, Mr. Mankiw proposed raising the gasoline tax to pay for an across-the-board income tax cut. Today, that kind of proposal probably would get him fired; as much as the Bush White House values loyalty, it puts even more stock in staying ''on message.'' 
 Administration officials made it clear they were unhappy with Mr. Mankiw's comments about outsourcing. When the Republican House Speaker, J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, fired off a letter of complaint about the comments, they urged him to write an apology and say he had been misinterpreted. He did so.
 Mr. Mankiw's comment on outsourcing ushered the White House into a political mire it was unprepared for, according to Kevin A. Hassett, a Republican economist at the American Enterprise Institute. 
 ''The administration's problem is that it hasn't decided how to handle the political attacks that the opposition is making,'' Mr. Hassett said. ''They are all panicked. They are terrified of saying anything.''
 Mr. Mankiw ''said what economists tend to say,'' said Allen Sinai, economist at Decision Economics, but ''he missed the highly political nature of speech, and he is stuck in the middle of the political season.''
 Even economists sympathetic to Mr. Mankiw on trade issues have been critical of his prediction that the nation will add 2.6 million jobs in 2004 -- in effect, about 320,000 jobs a month.
 The actual rate of job creation has been less than 100,000 jobs a month since last fall, and the consensus view among forecasters surveyed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia is that the rate will be only 91,000 jobs a month for 2004.
 J. Bradford DeLong, a professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley, called the forecast ''ludicrously optimistic.'' But Mr. Mankiw, he added, does not bear all the blame. The Treasury Department and the Office of Management and Budget signed off on the forecast -- until they disavowed it.

HEADLINE: Small Rally Halts Wall Street's Five-Day Losing Streak

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A small rally halted Wall Street's five-day losing streak yesterday, but a lack of market-moving news and light volume meant that there was little conviction behind the gains. Technology stocks, which bore the brunt of the market's recent selling, regained the most ground.
 Even with the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, reiterating his bullish economic outlook on Capitol Hill, many investors seemed to be holding back until next week's jobs and payroll reports, which are expected to give a clearer picture of the economic recovery. Only bargain hunters and a handful of institutional buyers seemed to fuel the advance, analysts said. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 35.25 points, or 0.3 percent, to 10,601.62. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 4.58 points, or 0.4 percent, at 1,143.67, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq composite index gained 17.54 points, or 0.9 percent, to 2,022.98. The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies gained 7.17 points, or 1.2 percent, to 579.04.
 With the Dow more than 100 points off its recent high of 10,714.88, set on Feb. 17, stocks are not expected to move much higher in the coming weeks, especially with earnings season over and no big economic news expected.
 ''We may have seen a little bounce from Greenspan, but not much,'' said Stephen Sachs, director of trading for Rydex Investments. ''February is historically one of the weakest months of the year, and the last week of the month is the weakest week. There's not a lot driving things right now.''
 Stocks managed the advance despite some disappointment over the National Association of Realtors' report that existing home sales fell 5.2 percent in January, to 6.04 million, from 6.37 million in December. Analysts had been expecting that 6.25 million homes sold for the month.
 There was better news about mortgages. According to the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, consumers are still responding to historically low interest rates. The association's mortgage application index rose 2.1 percent for the week, while its refinancing index climbed 1.9 percent.
 New mortgages and refinancing are considered barometers of economic growth, as consumers feel comfortable enough to take on more debt and, in the case of refinancing, have more money to put back into the economy.
 ''We've had good news, but that won't necessarily translate into market gains anymore,'' said Stuart Freeman, chief equity strategist for A.G. Edwards & Sons. ''It's a double-edged sword, because at this point, the better the economy gets, the more likely we'll start to see higher interest rates.''
 Tiffany, the high-end retailer, posted a 24 percent rise in profits for the latest quarter and gave a bright outlook for 2004. Tiffany surged $2.36 to $39.48. H.&R. Block, the tax and financial services company, tumbled $4.09, to $54.41, after the tax and financial services company reported a 19 percent drop in quarterly profit because of lower mortgage-asset sales.
 Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by more than 2 to 1 on the Big Board, where volume came to 1.36 billion shares, compared with 1.54 billion on Tuesday.
 Treasury prices rose yesterday. The price on the benchmark 10-year note increased 3/32 to 99 29/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, was 4.01 percent, down from 4.03 percent on Tuesday.
 Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of two-year notes:

HEADLINE: Kerry and Edwards Hit Campaign Trail in 2 Big, Crucial States

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and DAVID M. HALBFINGER; Adam Nagourney reported from Claremont, and David M. Halbfinger from Toledo, Ohio.

DATELINE: CLAREMONT, Calif., Feb. 25 

 BODY:
Senator John Edwards came to a college community in this affluent Los Angeles suburb on Wednesday to implore students to rise in a fight against poverty, as his chief rival, Senator John Kerry, campaigned in Ohio, pushing a package of job-creation incentives and deploring the loss of jobs overseas.
 The Democratic campaign's focus on the jobless and poor came a day after Mr. Kerry won new victories in the Utah, Idaho and Hawaii primaries.
 Mr. Edwards said that ''you and I have a basic American responsibility'' to end what he described as ''this grave injustice'' shadowing the nation. 
 ''I want to know, When did it become acceptable to dismiss our challenges as just the way things are?'' Mr. Edwards said as his audience responded with loud and enthusiastic cheers. ''When did it become O.K. to ignore our toughest problems because it's going to take a long time to solve them? When did 'it's just too hard' become an excuse?''
 ''Poverty has many causes,'' Mr. Edwards said, uncharacteristically reading his speech from a lectern. ''But the biggest cause of all is the silence of people who can do something about it.''
 As Mr. Edwards devoted an entire 25-minute speech here to poverty, Mr. Kerry hit hard at the theme of job losses as he sought to fight off Mr. Edward's criticism of supporting trade treaties that Mr. Edwards said contributed to job loss in the country. 
 But Mr. Kerry offered few new proposals to stop the flow of jobs overseas, saying he would require companies to report such moves and give workers three months' notice first. He ignored Mr. Edwards, instead attacking President Bush for saying in a speech on Monday that the economy was moving forward.
 ''I don't think George Bush knows what's going on in the real America, with real workers, where people are struggling,'' Mr. Kerry told more than 800 people at the University of Toledo.
 Mr. Edwards typically calls on the nation to fight poverty as one of his campaign themes 
 But Mr. Edwards, known for giving virtually the identical speech at stop after stop, unveiled a new one that was entirely directed at what he said should be a moral crusade in this country. His aides drew attention to the fact that he had chosen to give a speech about poverty at Pomona College, in a leafy suburb in the mountains about 40 miles east of Los Angeles.
 He did it at a time of difficulty in his campaign -- polls suggest that he is facing a defeat in the voting here next Tuesday. And in losing to Mr. Kerry again on Tuesday night, he came in third in Hawaii, behind Representative Dennis J. Kucinich. Mr. Kucinich's showing in Hawaii allowed him to earn his first six delegates in the contest.
 If Mr. Edwards was distressed by that, he showed no signs of it as he arrived here Wednesday afternoon for a three-day swing through this state.
 ''People said it was too hard and too impossible to go to the moon, but we did,'' he said, as the crowd shouted in response. ''People said that we could never cure polio, but we did. And people say that we can never lift millions of Americans out of poverty, and I'm here to tell you today that together, we are going to do it.''
 Saying there was a general acceptance of poverty in Washington, Mr. Edwards told the audience: ''We can build one America that no longer accepts the phrase, working poor. I want the phrase working poor to never be spoken by another American.''
 And Mr. Edwards, like Mr. Kerry, mocked Mr. Bush's approach to these problems.
 ''It is clear that when our president is someone who understands that a rising tide lifts all boats, America prospers and grows stronger and millions of Americans are lifted out of poverty,'' Mr. Edwards said. ''And when our president is someone who believes that a rising tide is there to get the yachts out of the harbor, America suffers.''
 This was the third day in the last week that Mr. Kerry campaigned in Ohio, a state where Mr. Edwards is looking for an upset and a state that will be pivotal in the general election.
 Mr. Kerry said that as president would have his Labor Department track the flight of jobs overseas and study ways to counteract the trend.
 ''We're going to demand accountability from corporations when jobs are unjustifiably shipped overseas,'' he said. ''We're going to require full disclosure to the American public about how many jobs are being sent overseas, where they're going, and why they're going.''
 Mr. Kerry at one point acknowledged, however, that mere studies would accomplish little.
 ''All of us know that all the ideas and all the position papers in the world won't add up to much if we don't have a president who is ready to wage the fight and who knows how to win it,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Kerry Pitch Puts the Focus on Jobs

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG

 BODY:

Senator John Kerry began running this 30-second advertisement throughout Ohio and in upstate New York, two economically distressed areas, yesterday.

PRODUCER -- Riverfront Media/GMMB & SDD.

ON THE SCREEN -- The spot opens with Mr. Kerry addressing a union audience, workers in green and purple T-shirts, while standing before four American flags. He is wearing a jacket and tie. In the next shot, his tie is gone and his blazer is replaced with a leather bomber jacket as he shakes hands and laughs with workers in hard hats. The viewer is next transported to a factory gate that slams shut before the camera's eye. The screen flashes the words, ''End tax breaks that reward companies for shipping jobs overseas.'' The next shot shows factory workers welding and otherwise assembling unspecified parts. The spot ends with Mr. Kerry, bathed in sunlight in his home office, voicing approval for his commercial.

THE SCRIPT -- Mr. Kerry says, ''Three million jobs lost. That is an astonishing failure.'' The narrator says, ''John Kerry's got the strength and experience to fight for America's jobs.'' Mr. Kerry says, ''We need to be on the side of America's workers.'' The narrator says, ''His plan: End tax breaks that reward companies for shipping jobs overseas. New incentives to create and keep good jobs here. A real plan to get health care costs under control.'' Mr. Kerry says: ''George Bush won't do it. I will. I'm John Kerry, and I approved this message.''

ACCURACY -- Mr. Kerry's common assertion that the economy has lost three million jobs under President Bush is almost true, technically. Still, though Bureau of Labor Statistics data show the economy lost nearly three million jobs through much of Mr. Bush's tenure, Mr. Kerry's figure does not seem to take into full account jobs that have been added to the economy. Bureau of Labor Statistics data show the net job loss to be nearer 2.3 million. Mr. Kerry's plan to reward companies for keeping jobs in the United States is similar to Senator John Edwards's jobs plan. Republicans have questioned whether Mr. Kerry could adequately pay for his health care plan to limit costs.

SCORECARD -- This spot tries to address two competitors, from opposite parties, in one televised swoop. On the one hand, it is meant to take the jobs issue away from Mr. Edwards, who has used it to make inroads against Mr. Kerry in economically depressed areas where Mr. Kerry's vote for the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1993 is a potential liability. Mr. Edwards was not in the Senate in 1993 but has said he would not have voted for the pact. As much as the spot seems to try blatantly to co-opt Mr. Edwards's bread-and-butter themes, it could prove effective at stripping him of his ownership of the jobs issue, just the same. The spot also takes a dig at President Bush for job losses during his tenure, a likely prominent theme in the general election campaign. This could prove particularly effective against the president in Ohio, a swing state that has suffered a heavy loss of jobs. But in running such an advertisement, Mr. Kerry gives ammunition to strategists for Mr. Bush who point out that for all of his complaints about their attacks on him, Mr. Kerry has spent at least $5 million on commercials that criticize the president in some way since September. Then again, the Bush strategists are planning to begin responding next week with an advertising campaign that is expected to cost tens of millions of dollars. JIM RUTENBERG

HEADLINE: Even With Early Primary, California Still Has Bit Part

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

DATELINE: GLENDALE, Calif., Feb. 25 

 BODY:
California has pushed up the date of its presidential primary each election since 1992 in an effort to have a role more worthy of the nation's most populous state.
 Now, with less than a week to go before the Super Tuesday primaries, California, whose trove of 370 delegates represents 17 percent of the total needed to win the Democratic nomination, may serve only to ratify the front-runner's march to the summer convention.
 Two polls this week showed the leader, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, as the favorite going into a debate here on Thursday. A Field Poll released on Wednesday had Mr. Kerry leading Senator John Edwards of North Carolina among likely California primary voters, 60 percent to 19 percent. A poll by The Los Angeles Times this week showed Mr. Kerry leading Mr. Edwards, 56 percent to 24 percent. 
 Even if Mr. Kerry should somehow falter here -- the polls show some volatility -- he will still walk away with a large number of delegates under rules that allocate delegates in proportion to the popular vote.
 ''There's no question that our efforts to move up the primary didn't work out in quite the way we had hoped,'' said Antonio Villaraigosa, a Democratic member of the Los Angeles City Council, a former speaker of the State Assembly and a national co-chairman of Mr. Kerry's campaign. ''The rest of the states moved up their primaries, as well, and effectively undermined our effort to be more relevant.''
 California has not had a decisive role in nominating a presidential candidate of either party since 1972, when George McGovern won the Democratic primary here but faced a convention challenge from Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey, who tried to claim a share of the state's 271 delegates.
 Willie L. Brown Jr., then a fiery young member of the Assembly and a fervent backer of Mr. McGovern, mounted the stage at the Democratic National Convention in Miami and demanded, ''Give me back my delegation!'' 
 Mr. McGovern beat back the Humphrey forces, won the nomination and was then crushed by the incumbent, President Richard M. Nixon.
 In the following years, nominations were decided long before California's primaries in June. In 1996, party officials moved the vote to late March, still too late to affect the outcome in either party. In 2000, they moved it to March 7. But Vice President Al Gore was already the presumptive Democratic nominee, and the state only cemented George W. Bush's victory over Senator John McCain in the Republican contest. 
 This year, the primary will be this Tuesday, March 2, along with those of nine other states, including New York and Ohio. 
 Polls indicate that the state does not appear likely to be competitive in November, with large majorities preferring the Democratic candidate to Mr. Bush. Mr. Gore won the state by 1.3 million votes in 2000.
 Yet, Republican officials noted the large number of votes for Arnold Schwarzenegger and other Republican candidates in the recall election for governor in the fall and said Mr. Bush would probably spend considerable time and money courting votes here in the general election.
 Despite the size of the delegate cache and huge electoral vote count, none of the Democratic candidates are spending much time or money in the state, which is known for its expensive media markets. Mr. Edwards began three days of campaigning on Wednesday. Mr. Kerry will be here on Thursday and Friday. Both are hoping to gain visibility from the CNN-Los Angeles Times debate that will be broadcast here on Thursday evening. Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio and the Rev. Al Sharpton of New York will also participate.
 The debate stands to help Mr. Edwards more than Mr. Kerry, because he is far less well known and well organized here, political professionals said. 
 ''What one expects is not that Kerry loses the debate or Edwards wins it,'' said Representative Brad Sherman, a San Fernando Valley Democrat who, along with almost half the state's Democratic Congressional delegation, supports Mr. Kerry, ''but that it has a positive effect on Edwards, because he goes in relatively unknown.''
 Roger Salazar, the California communications director for Mr. Edwards's campaign, noted that his candidate had finished strongly in several states, including Wisconsin and Iowa, and that he expected Mr. Edwards to do the same here. He said his candidate's message appealed to independent voters, roughly one-quarter of the California electorate, who are eligible to vote in the primary under the state's new rules.
 ''Voters in California are pretty independent, very centrist and middle of the road,'' Mr. Salazar said.
 He said Mr. Edwards would campaign in Pomona, Fresno, Sacramento, San Francisco and Los Angeles over the next three days, hoping to capitalize on news coverage.
 Mr. Edwards may also benefit from Californians' proclivity to ignore political races until the last minute. The recent Field and Los Angeles Times polls found that 10 percent or more of likely voters were undecided in the primary and had not closely studied the ballot initiatives that will also be decided on Tuesday. 
 A Republican primary to name a challenger to Senator Barbara Boxer has likewise generated little interest. Bill Jones, a former California secretary of state, is favored to win the Republican Senate primary against several lesser-known candidates.
 Jesse Sammons, a second-year medical student from La Canada Flintridge, a suburb north of Los Angeles, said that he leaned toward Mr. Kerry but that he remained open to changing his mind.
 ''I like the way Edwards talks, but I don't know exactly what he's saying,'' said Mr. Sammons, who added that he voted for Ralph Nader in 2000 but that he was hesitant to do so again. ''Kerry is not as exciting. But I know more about him.''
 Mr. Sammons said he would probably not make up his mind until after the debate on Thursday.
 Alma Soto, a cashier at a men's clothing store in Glendale and a lifelong Democrat, said she was concerned about the Iraq conflict and the economy. Ms. Soto said that she knew little about Mr. Kerry's positions on the issues, but that she thought he had more experience than Mr. Edwards.
 Like other voters across the country, Californians cite jobs and the economy as their most important concerns in polls. But the Iraq conflict animates many voters as well, particularly the sizable cadre of supporters of Howard Dean, who dropped out of the race this month.
 Because the California ballots were printed in January, Dr. Dean's name, along with those of other candidates who have dropped out, will appear on them. Many supporters of Dr. Dean say they plan to vote for him as a protest, as well as in hopes of meeting the 15 percent threshold for winning convention delegates.
 Rick Jacobs, state chairman of Dr. Dean's campaign, said supporters would rally outside the debate and planned to cast ballots for Dr. Dean.
 ''It's not so much an act of protest,'' Mr. Jacobs said. ''But to show that we care about the issues we got involved with and we want to make sure people know we still care.''

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about California's role in presidential primaries misstated the title held by Hubert H. Humphrey when he lost to George McGovern in the state's Democratic primary in 1972. He was a senator, no longer the vice president.

HEADLINE: Two Different Democrats, Same Advisers and Ideas

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

DATELINE: ONTARIO, Calif., Feb. 24 

 BODY:
When John Kerry was asked to list his closest foreign policy advisers the other day, he served up two names: Richard C. Holbrooke and Samuel R. Berger, veterans of Bill Clinton's presidency.
 When John Edwards, Mr. Kerry's main opponent in the Democratic presidential nomination battle, was asked the same question in a separate interview this week with reporters and editors of The New York Times, he also served up two names: Mr. Holbrooke and Mr. Berger. 
 Both Mr. Kerry and Mr. Edwards said the mayor of San Francisco should stop issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. Both said they opposed gay marriage but supported some form of civil unions for gays.
 Both men, notwithstanding any reservations they might have voiced to Democratic voters earlier, offered some praise of free trade. Both said they wanted to roll back some of President Bush's tax cuts.
 They even suggested some similarities in their upbringing. Mr. Kerry, a senator from Massachusetts, said he grew up as an altar boy, emphasizing qualities he thought would help his candidacy fly south of the Mason-Dixon line. Mr. Edwards, a senator from North Carolina, offered himself as someone who is ''from the rural South, a place that is very culturally conservative.''
 The remarks by the two men stood as evidence of what has proved to be a big obstacle facing them in this long-awaited two-person contest leading up to the 10-state vote on Tuesday. For all their efforts to discover space between them, Mr. Edwards and Mr. Kerry hold strikingly similar views of the world's problems and what to do about them.
 But they have different views of each other's political appeal and strength as a Democratic opponent to Mr. Bush. And that was abundantly clear at the end of these two interview sessions. 
 ''He's done a great job in a short span of time,'' Mr. Kerry said of Mr. Edwards, who has served five years in Washington. Mr. Kerry left the contrast with his own ''35 years of experience'' in government, a phrase he used at least twice, hanging.
 For his part, Mr. Edwards said of the American electorate: ''I just say this directly. They want someone who will inspire them, who can lift them up.'' 
 In many ways, their appearances underlined the very stylistic differences that they have been trying to point out in the closing days of this part of what has largely been an issue-free campaign.
 Mr. Kerry seemed more in command of the foreign policy angle of the day, effortlessly discussing the history of President Jean-Bertrand Aristide of Haiti and the problems there. ''Not to pander, but your editorial this morning hit it right on the head,'' Mr. Kerry said. He went on to say that he would not support a military intervention by the United States right now, but added that such a move that it might make sense later on.
 By contrast, Mr. Edwards responded with uncertainty about the violence in Haiti and whether the United States should send forces there. ''You know, I don't have -- I can't set some arbitrary -- I think it's a judgment that you have to make on a case by case,'' he said.
 Mr. Edwards was lively and engaging, smiling and leaning into his questioners as he talked animatedly about everything from free trade to his upbringing in a mill town. He joked and spoke passionately about what, he said, would make him a powerful candidate against Mr. Bush.
 ''If we don't have a candidate who can effectively make the case against Bush and tap into those emotions that you're talking about, we won't win,'' he said.
 Mr. Kerry, who has by now spent a year observing Mr. Edwards, also smiled and leaned into his questioners, referring to them by first name and offering a joke or two. Mr. Kerry said he had learned a lot about being a candidate from his near-loss in Iowa, and he bristled at a suggestion that Mr. Edwards's gains on him in the closing days of some of these primaries suggested that voters found Mr. Edwards more likable.
 ''I wouldn't agree with the premise,'' he said. 
 Still, more than once, Mr. Kerry's answers would wander down the tracks, thick with the Washingtonese that he had moments earlier said had been purged from his speech, as his listeners sunk deeper into their seats. An aide seated near him did not try to hide a yawn or two.
 Not surprisingly for two men running for president, each evaded problematic questions, though in different ways: When asked if he would as president take the politically risky step of eliminating protections for the American sugar and cotton industries, Mr. Edwards smiled broadly and told the paper's editorial board, ''Don't I wish I could give you what you want.''
 ''I'm not for eliminating subsidies for family farmers,'' he said. ''I am for eliminating subsidies for corporate farming operations, people who make over a million dollars a year in net profits.''
 When a questioner noted that the Louisiana primary is two weeks away, Mr. Edwards responded: ''Yeah, you think I don't know that? Yeah, I think I'll stick where I am on that.''
 Mr. Kerry was similarly nonresponsive: ''That is one of those issues that will be under review'' in the first 120 days of his presidency, he said.
 Mr. Kerry answered most questions, at least eventually, and often after an adventurous digression (a request to name his domestic policy advisers produced a five-minute discussion of his health care plan).
 But even at this late date in the primary campaign, there were times Mr. Edwards seemed caught off guard by fairly standard questions. When he was asked to name his domestic advisers, Mr. Edwards pursed his lips and wrinkled his brow. ''Let me think,'' he said. ''You're testing me. Who have I been talking to about economic policy? It's been so long since I talked to anybody other than myself about economic policy.''

HEADLINE: C.I.A. Says Election in Iran Dealt Blow to Reform

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS JEHL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
With the victory of religious hard-liners in this week's parliamentary elections in Iran, the Central Intelligence Agency is warning of a new era of repression and inflexibility. 
 A new C.I.A. assessment, shared with members of Congress this week and described by intelligence officials, says the election has dealt a severe blow to Iranian reformers and will strengthen the authoritarian rule of the country's clerical government. The assessment says the ascendancy of the hard-liners will make it unlikely that Iran will moderate its foreign policies. 
 The State Department has condemned the election as unfair, because some 2,000 candidates were prevented from running, including 87 reformists standing for re-election. But the assessment also blames Iran's president, Mohammad Khatami, and his reformist allies within the government for squandering their political capital through ''their refusal to back bold promises with equally bold actions.'' 
 The assessment describes the government of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, as ''secure for now,'' but it says the election results will ultimately ''only further deepen the discontent with clerical rule, which is now discredited and publicly criticized as never before.''
 The detailed written assessment was reflected in public testimony by George J. Tenet, the director of central intelligence, to the Senate intelligence committee on Tuesday. It comes at a time when the Bush administration and the International Atomic Energy Agency are pressing Iran for more information about its covert nuclear program, and suggests that Iran is not likely to reconsider its resistance to that effort. 
 While Iran has agreed to open itself to more inspections from the international agency, and has acknowledged producing low-enriched uranium for use in a civilian nuclear power program, it is also ''trying to preserve its W.M.D. options,'' Mr. Tenet said, referring to unconventional arms known as ''weapons of mass destruction.'' 
 Iran also continues to support terrorist groups, including Hezbollah, the assessment says, and is seeking to counter American influence in Iraq through a number of means, including clandestine activity.
 ''The strengthening of authoritarian rule will make breaking out of old foreign policy patterns more difficult,'' Mr. Tenet told the committee. Still, he added, ''Because Khamanei and his allies have kept a close rein on foreign policy, we do not expect the defeat of the reformists to lead to a sudden change in Iranian policy.'' 
 Based on the election results, the religious hard-liners are expected to hold at least a 146-seat majority in Iran's 290-seat Parliament when it convenes in June. The majority includes factions that support the absolute rule of Ayatollah Khamenei, but disagree on issues like social freedom, economic policy and relations with the United States.
 Mr. Tenet told the Senate committee that the C.I.A. expected Ayatollah Khamenei's government to shut down many outlets for political dissent, and possibly to ''resort to new heavy-handedness that produces public outrage and protest.'' At least eight people were killed and 30 injured in election-related violence last weekend. 
 In the last year, critics of Ayatollah Khamenei's government took bold new steps in proclaiming their opposition, including publishing open letters calling for an end to absolute clerical rule. 
 Even so, the C.I.A. assessment describes the prevailing mood among the Iranian public as apathetic rather than confrontational, and Mr. Tenet said in his testimony that ''regime intimidation has cowed the populace.''
 In the months after the American invasion of Iraq, some Bush administration officials warned loudly about efforts by Iran's Shiite Muslim government to influence events in Iraq through proxies including the Badr Organization, an Iranian-trained militia affiliated with a major Iraqi Shiite opposition group, the Supreme Council for the Islamic Revolution in Iraq.

HEADLINE: Can One Group's White Elephant Be Another's Gold Mine?

BYLINE: By Frances Anderton

 BODY:
When Hollywood and Highland, above, a complex including movie theaters, shops, restaurants and the Kodak Theater (where the Oscars will be held on Sunday) opened just over two years ago, it was expected to be the crown in the revival of Hollywood Boulevard. But it has proved to be a white elephant bigger than those atop its fake Babylonian towers. The owners, Trizec Properties, are selling it to the CIM Group for around $200 million. (It was once said to be worth more than $600 million.) The CIM Group hopes to turn Hollywood and Highland around, but it faces a serious challenge. Not only did the project suffer from a dramatic downturn in the economy and initially annoy drivers with expensive parking, but it wavered between the theatrical and the tasteful: ''It looks like it was designed by some Romanians based on a postcard of Las Vegas,'' said the Los Angeles architecture critic Michael Webb. And the development largely faces away from one of the few streets in Los Angeles that has a lot of foot traffic. ''Hollywood is about its pedestrian night life,'' said Rose Apodaca Jones, the West Coast bureau chief of Women's Wear Daily and a co-owner of three popular Hollywood bars. In the Hollywood and Highland complex, she said, ''you are trapped.'' 
 But John Given, a principal in the CIM Group, is undaunted. Citing the Renaissance Hollywood Hotel (an adjoining building included in the sale), the 65,000 square feet of banquet and meeting space managed by the chef Wolfgang Puck, and busy spots like the Highlands club and the Lucky Strike Lanes bowling alley, he says that the project can still be a catalyst for the continued revival of Hollywood. Meanwhile, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences says it is committed to the remaining 17 years on its contract to produce the Oscar telecast at the Kodak Theater, designed by David Rockwell.

HEADLINE: Fine Fertilizer, Those Dollar Bills

BYLINE: By ANNE RAVER

 BODY:
IT'S shrewd marketing, of course, for the New York Botanical Garden to open its brand-new shop on the first day of its spectacular orchid show.
 The shop is part of the $21 million visitors' center designed by Hugh Hardy, which includes a cafe, ticket booths and an orientation center at the garden's main gate on Kazimiroff Boulevard near Fordham Road in the Bronx. The whole complex -- with its New York bluestone walls, stretches of airy glass, curved roofs, landscaped plaza and reflecting pool -- opens on May 1. But the new shop makes its debut tomorrow, along with the orchid show, which is expected to draw 80,000 visitors. And this spring, when the shop starts selling things like rare alpines, daphnes and heirloom tomato seedlings, it may well give the best local nurseries (not to mention Smith & Hawken and Takashimaya) a run for their money.
 In some ways, this is a wonderful extension of the service and education the garden has provided since its first garden classes in 1917, because the books and art and plants have been judiciously selected. It is a museum shop, like those run by the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney. But is this what a botanical garden should be doing? 
 As I stood inside the shop, looking through the glass wall to the grove of cinnamon-bark Tanyosho pines and the glass dome of the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory glinting in the sun, I remembered strolling 20 years ago through the dilapidated conservatory, which leaked and wheezed and had to be vented by hand cranks. Its hodgepodge of tropical trees and vines may have been priceless, but only a botanist could identify them -- or understand their significance. 
 Now there are almost too many signs. The children's adventure garden verges on cuteness. The demonstration gardens are so tidy they are stiff.
 This is the same hard economic equation many museums are facing. On the one hand, a botanical garden should be about education and contemplation. But on the other, it has to be self-supporting. And if the shop helps pay for children's education, who can complain?
 Still, I miss the days when no signs pointed to the children's adventure garden (there wasn't one) and admission was free. But the botanists were then being paid from a dwindling endowment. No money was available for capital repairs. By the 1970's, the garden looked as run-down as the city's parks.
 The Visitors' Pavilion is the latest innovation at the 112-year-old garden since Gregory Long became president in 1989. ''We have to bring revenue into the garden,'' said Mr. Long, who rallied fund-raisers to beef up the endowment, which is now $90 million. The garden's cafe, catered weddings and other special events already reap more than $500,000 a year; about 1,000 continuing education classes bring in $400,000.
 ''These activities support children's education and Bronx Green-Up,'' Mr. Long said, referring to the garden's community garden program.
 I have watched these changes over the years -- the signs in the conservatory explaining the origins and uses of plants, the neatly ordered beds in the demonstration gardens, where you can get a list of the latest tulips or viburnums. I adore the new library, where you can sit in the temperature-controlled rare books room, turning the pages of a 300-year-old herbal. You could do that in the dusty, cozy old library, but few people knew.
 Everything is so polished now. Nary a weed is allowed in the peony beds. The day lilies all have labels. Schoolchildren troop through, learning things they couldn't have imagined in the shabby old garden of yore. But there was something fertile in those untended places. Like children without nannies, we were allowed to wander and dream.
 There is no denying that the Shop in the Garden is a great store. Plants start at $6. You can page through reproductions of rare books, like one of the 17th-century ''Ville e Giardini di Roma,'' by Giovanni Battista Falda ($300), or buy a reproduction of a botanical print of Cedrus libani (cedar of Lebanon) from the 19th-century ''Pinetum Britannicum,'' by Edward Ravenscroft ($265). You can easily be tempted by other delicious things only distantly related to horticulture, like Belgian hand-blown glass vases by Henry Dean ($28 to $265), or a woven-grass chair from Bali ($2,400), which is artfully surrounded by Areca palms ($637) and a Queen sago ($1,528).
 ''It's a long way from the old tent with the AstroTurf rug,'' said Catherine Hipp, the director of garden retail and business development, referring to the temporary shop that stood for five years on the grass in front of the Conservatory.
 The bookshop alone rivals anything in New York for garden bibliophiles: 3,000 titles (including 100 on orchids, in honor of the orchid show), as well as rare and out-of-print books from Hinck & Wall, an antiquarian bookseller in Paris.
 The outdoor plant shop, to open in early April, will offer many of the same plants blooming in the garden, like Baptisia sphaerocarpa Screaming Yellow, and a new Daphne genkwa hybrid whose lavender flowers bloom on bare branches.
 Depending on the weather, 600,000 to 700,000 visitors flock to this garden every year. The new shop, just like the cafe, is designed to keep them there a bit longer, spending more money. ''We want people to spend the day, sit in the cafe, in the sun, reading their new book,'' Mr. Long said.
 I'm not sure I can start my summer without the $300 aluminum table with glass top and planter tray beneath (perfect, I figure for trailing rosemary), with an elegant three-foot metal and copper vase by Herve Gambs of Paris ($165) perched on its top. And I want some of those organic hand towels. (The cotton comes from Peru, and they are woven in Japan on wind-powered looms.)
 This garden shop is perfect and tasteful and even organic. But it feels a little bit like the tail wagging the dog.

An Orchid-Filled Rain Forest Appears in the Bronx
 LAST Thursday, workers at the New York Botanical Garden were trundling thousands of orchids into the Enid A. Haupt Conservatory, attaching purple vandas and delicate yellow-freckled oncidiums to sassafras branches high overhead, and sinking pots of lady-slipper orchids and spotted phalaenopsis among the ferns and philodendrons.
 The second annual Orchid Show opens tomorrow.
 Darrin Duling, curator of glasshouse collections, stood under the glass dome of the Palm Gallery near a pool soon to reflect hundreds of ivory, pink and magenta oncidiums. In a wing devoted to lowland rain forests, thousands of cattleyas will bloom among trees and ferns. Another gallery will be filled with masdevallia orchids, native to the cloud forests of Peru; behind glass will be plants the size of thumbnails, their blooms the size of pinheads.
 The grand slam was already in place in the Seasonal Exhibition Galleries, where a Mayan ruin rises 20 feet, covered with lianas and ferns. (A tip of the hat to Philip Baloun, the show's designer.)
 The show includes guided tours, talks on orchid conservation and research, and workshops on growing orchids at home; information, (718) 817-8700 or www.nybg.org. And the new Shop in the Garden is selling hundreds of orchids.
 Mr. Duling, who will give a talk on Brazilian rain forest orchids on March 13, did not divulge the location of his most prized possession this year: a Psychopsis papilio. The species resembles a large orange and yellow butterfly and was discovered in Trinidad in the early 1800's, setting off orchid mania in England. One will be hidden somewhere in the conservatory until the show ends on March 28. Go find it. ANNE RAVER

HEADLINE: Piercing the Fog With a Tiny Chip

BYLINE: By ANNE EISENBERG. 
E-mail: Eisenberg@nytimes.com

 BODY:
RADAR technology was once synonymous with the big and the bulky -- for instance, the heavy, rotating antennas at the airport, scanning skies and runways. 
 But lately radar, like so many other technologies, has been slimming down. 
 Now a team of electrical engineers at the California Institute of Technology has shrunk the functions of a radar system into one tiny, intricately designed silicon chip and eight minuscule antennas.
 The basic building blocks of the radar system are all fully integrated on the chip, including power generation, signal processing, and dozens of other functions. 
 The intricate parallel circuitry is designed so that the eight antennas can work together to focus and steer a beam of microwaves. Although the circuit design is highly complex, the silicon chip can be made in bulk using inexpensive lithographic methods, said Ali Hajimiri, an associate professor of electrical engineering who leads the group on high-speed integrated circuits that created the chip. 
 ''It should cost no more than a few dollars,'' he said.
 The high-frequency beams that the system generates and receives may one day handle many functions, including the usual radar jobs of ranging and location. In cars, for example, the chip might be used to detect other vehicles looming in the fog.
 The chip may also be used for wireless communications, since it has a broad bandwidth or range of frequencies at which it communicates. And it produces a bit stream at roughly the rate of fiber optics, more than enough for quick downloads of movies and other digital data. 
 ''D.S.L. can go to several hundred kilobits, and fiber can go to several gigabits per second,'' Dr. Hajimiri said. The radar chip can achieve bit rates up to a gigabit per second, partly because of the concentrated nature of the beam, he said. ''The beam created by the chip is highly focused,'' he said. 
 The chip could combine the functions of sensing and communication, say, for a group of army tanks that needs to stay in touch in the field. 
 ''Using these extremely high frequencies, you can first capture location, sending out pulses and scanning the area like a bat,'' said Volkan Ozguz, chief scientist at Irvine Sensors in Costa Mesa, Calif. Irvine Sensors makes miniature electronic systems, including sensors. ''Then, using the same chipset, you can start communicating at high frequency,'' exchanging information without switching to different equipment, he said.
 The new radar chips do not create pulses as powerful as those now used in aviation systems, but they could be used in arrays to multiply their power, Dr. Hajimiri said. 
 The eight antennas on the new chip are not the sort that protrude from old-fashioned rotating radar shells. Instead, the antennas -- actually traces of metal on a PC board -- do not move at all: their bearings are adjusted not mechanically but electrically by circuits that imitate the behavior of rotating antennas, focusing and steering the beam of radio signals in the right direction.
 Usually the radiated signals arrive at the separate antennas at different times. But electronic devices called phase shifters compensate for these delays, in effect combining and enhancing the collective power of the signal for a desired direction, and rejecting emissions from other directions.
 ''It's neat because you can get the eight antennas to work together so that you can transmit in a narrow beam,'' said David B. Rutledge, a professor of electrical engineering at Caltech and a colleague of Dr. Hajimiri. ''Then you transmit with eight times as much power.''
 The phased array antennas can be made insensitive to unwanted signals, limiting interference. ''In cellphones, when you add people, there's interference,'' he said. ''But these circuits can figure out how to reduce power from a direction they don't want.''
 Dr. Hajimiri used a comparison between a light bulb and a laser pointer to explain how the chip could make the best use of its power. Light bulbs illuminate the whole space, he said, but a laser concentrates power in one spot. ''The power in our beam can be concentrated, too, and sent in the right direction,'' he said. ''Hundreds of milliwatts of omni-directional power is not as effective as focused power of a few milliwatts.''
 The higher frequencies and subsequent short wavelengths at which the chip operates make the multiple-antenna approach possible. Antenna size is usually about half that of the wavelengths handled, so at these short wavelengths the space between each antenna can be half a centimeter or less.
 The Caltech team has demonstrated a prototype with both the transmitter and receiver on the same chip, although the transmitter and receiver have often been separated for testing. The chip was presented this month at the International Solid State Circuit Conference in San Francisco.
 The chip may have its first application in low-cost automotive radar systems. Ian Gresham, senior principal engineer at M/A-Com of Lowell, Mass., a maker of radar for automotive and other applications, said the chip's technology and performance were highly promising. 
 ''We are looking to get automotive radar into less expensive vehicles by reducing the cost,'' he said. ''The California group are using potentially much lower-cost technology and have a lot of nice features there.''
 The radar chip runs at 24 gigahertz, or 24 billion cycles per second. Recently the Federal Communications Commission approved the use of the microwave spectrum between 22 and 29 gigahertz for radar systems in vehicles. These systems create a continuously updated 360-degree map of the vehicle's surroundings to detect the location and movement of nearby objects. With this system, a deer standing in the fog near the roadside or a child playing behind a car in a driveway might be displayed on a dashboard monitor. 
 Radar is already part of some cruise-control systems in which a narrow beam is sent over the front of the vehicle and the information used to maintain a safe distance from the vehicle ahead. But the systems are relatively costly.
 The combination of functionality and a low manufacturing cost may help the chip gain acceptance one day. ''Traditionally you have one system for communications and another for radar,'' said Dr. Ozguz of Irvine Sensors. ''But this combines both and makes it much less expensive.''

HEADLINE: McGreevey's Optimism on Budget Plan Meets Criticism of Its Sources of Financing

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN

DATELINE: TRENTON, Feb. 25 

 BODY:
When Gov. James E. McGreevey presented his $26.26 billion budget on Tuesday, he described it as the product of a state that had turned the corner on tough times and ''put itself back on the right track.''
 But as legislators gathered on Wednesday to review the budget and other state issues, it was clear that his characterization remained very much in dispute. 
 At the session, organized by the Associated Press, Republicans said the budget relied heavily on new fees and taxes and depended too much on borrowing from the future rather than on revenue currently in hand. 
 Mr. McGreevey refrained on Wednesday from offering more specifics on just how much he is proposing to raise some taxes and fees in the coming year to pay for his new programs.
 The budget, for fiscal year 2005, proposes the biggest spending increase in five years. 
 The governor said yesterday that the state's improving economic picture had resulted in new spending opportunities for worthy programs.
 But it will also require raising $150 million from new fees collected from manufacturers of petroleum products, a 45 cent-per-pack increase in the cigarette tax, higher fines for unsafe drivers and a 1 percent fee on sales of houses valued at more than $1 million.
 The governor wants the state to take out a 20-year loan against money expected to come in from the cigarette tax and the driving fines to pay for state government costs.
 ''We are continuing the credit card mentality of budget matters in New Jersey,'' Leonard Lance, the Senate Republican leader, said at the forum at the Trenton Marriott, where he and other legislative leaders, as well as the governor, spoke about the budget on Wednesday.
 The governor's critics said the increased spending that he was proposing would affect the average taxpayer.
 Republican leaders at the forum on Wednesday said Mr. McGreevey and the Democratic-controlled Legislature had still not addressed a fundamental problem in New Jersey: skyrocketing property taxes.
 ''If this budget passes, the taxpayers in New Jersey should be prepared to pay higher property taxes,'' said Alex DeCroce, the Assembly minority leader and a Republican.
 Mr. McGreevey, however, said that he was keeping to his promise not to raise sales and income taxes, and he has challenged his critics to find other ways to cut the budget, or other ways to raise revenue.
 ''This budget reflects my values and reminds me of why I wanted to be governor,'' he said. ''The first two years were difficult. With this budget we're moving to a better vision of New Jersey.''
 The governor's proposed budget is $1.7 billion more than the current budget, which expires on June 30. 
 It includes $200 million in aid to school districts, $125 million to revamp the embattled Department of Youth and Family Services, $33 million to hire 200 state troopers and $10 million to cover tuition at community colleges for students who graduate in the top 20 percent of their high school classes.
 During a question and answer session with reporters, Mr. McGreevey became testy when he was asked for specifics about his proposal to raise $150 million from a new environmental impact fee on petrochemical companies. 
 Would the taxes be on gasoline as well as on other petroleum products like plastics? Some critics have said that the fees were a ''stealth tax'' that motorists would eventually pay at the gas pumps. 
 The governor backed down a few months ago on a plan for a gasoline tax increase 15 cents per gallon.
 ''No,'' the governor said to a question about whether it was a stealth tax. ''You'll have the finalized details within two to three weeks. This is a tax on petrochemicals, understanding that there have been environmental abuses in the past.''
 But because of the confusion about who would pay the tax and on what products, the assembly speaker, Albio Sires, a Democrat, later issued a statement about news reports about a gas tax increase of 3 cents.
 ''The governor assures me that this will be a tax on polluters and not on New Jersey drivers,'' Mr. Sires said.
 Mr. McGreevey also said his critics were wrong to compare him to former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman because of his proposal to pay for this budget out of money that the state did not yet have.
 ''There is a profound distinction between the previous administration that borrowed in the abstract and this one that is using dedicated revenue sources to pay for what we're doing,'' Mr. McGreevey said.

HEADLINE: Former Dancer Selected To Run Ballet Theater

BYLINE: By JENNIFER DUNNING

 BODY:
American Ballet Theater named Rachel S. Moore its new executive director yesterday, effective in mid-April. Ms. Moore has been the director of the Center for Dance Education at the Boston Ballet since 2001. The executive committee of the Ballet Theater board of directors met Wednesday, and its choice was affirmed by the full board yesterday.
 Ms. Moore arrives at a time when there has been high turnover among the company's executive directors and questions have been raised by former trustees about the company's financial health. Ballet Theater's auditor and company officials say the company is in good shape. This week, the company announced three new corporate sponsors and a challenge grant of $400,000. 
 Ms. Moore will be the fourth executive director at Ballet Theater in four years. She follows Elizabeth Harpel Kehler, who resigned in June after less than a year on the job. Wallace Chappell, who served less than two years before moving to another position in the company in 2002, succeeded Louis G. Spisto, who was forced to resign in 2001 after accusations of mismanagement. (Mr. Chappell has just been named executive director of the Paul Taylor Dance Company.)
 Ms. Moore, a former dancer with Ballet Theater, has held administrative posts at Project Step, a classical music school for minority students in Boston, at the Ballet Theater of Boston and at arts organizations including Americans for the Arts and the National Cultural Alliance, both in Washington. She taught in the graduate program in arts administration at Boston University. She graduated with honors from Brown University in 1992 and has a master's degree in arts administration from Columbia. She was a fellow at the executive program for nonprofit arts leaders at Stanford's Business School.
 ''What impressed me about Rachel was that she comes from within,'' Kevin McKenzie, artistic director of Ballet Theater and himself a former principal dancer with the company, said yesterday. ''She went away and got an amazing amount of training, and she's had practical experience. Ballet Theater took a big chance on me 11 years ago. Rachel has a proven managerial record.''
 Ms. Moore served as an interim leader of Boston Ballet in a similarly tumultuous period for that company, during her time as director of the company school, which has a budget of $4.5 million and 75 employees. In her years at Ballet Theater, from 1984 to 1988, when Mikhail Baryshnikov was artistic director, Ms. Moore was also a member of the dancers' union committee and chairwoman of the Dancers' Emergency Fund.
 ''I danced anything in a tutu in a line,'' she said yesterday of her career in the Ballet Theater corps. ''It was an honor to have been able to dance at that time with the company. It was inspirational just to see that caliber of dancer every night and see artists of such a great standard keep on growing.'' A foot injury ended her career.
 ''I've known a lot of these people for a long time, and I know the culture of the organization,'' she said. ''I have a common artistic language with Kevin and the artistic staff. I'm never going to second-guess that we need 24 swans. And I think that having a business background I'm able to communicate with people outside the dance world why it's so important to do what we do.''
 Unlike the New York City Ballet, Ballet Theater has no permanent home, which Ms. Moore mentioned when asked about issues she would address. ''Some people see that as a business disadvantage in certain ways,'' she said. ''Touring is good for the company, and all sorts of communities get to see high-quality dance. But it's hard when you don't have your own home. It's very expensive to tour and becoming increasingly so. I think one of the things that we are committed to is maintaining the leadership position as a national company and finding a sustainable economic model for that.''

HEADLINE: Transportation Depresses Durable-Goods Orders

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
Factory orders for big-ticket goods dropped 1.8 percent in January, the Commerce Department reported Thursday. Much of that reflected declines in orders for commercial and military aircraft. Excluding orders for transportation equipment like cars, trucks and planes, all other durable-goods orders increased 2 percent in January, up from a 1.7 percent advance in December. 
 The 1.8 percent decrease over all in orders for durable goods -- costly manufactured products expected to last at least three years -- came after a revised 1.6 percent gain in December, which was better than previously estimated. Economists had forecast a 1.4 percent rise in new orders in January; even so, the actual decline struck some as overstating the situation.
 ''Orders are bouncing around like crazy,'' said Joel Naroff of Naroff Economic Advisers, ''but when you cut through the clutter, demand remains pretty good. The general trend is still decent, but there is reason to be cautious as it would be nice to see a more consistent upward trend.''
 In other data, the Labor Department said new claims for unemployment benefits rose last week by 6,000, to 350,000, underlining the uneven quality of the economic recovery.
 Many plants continue to operate below capacity. Economists hope businesses will accelerate capital spending this year and invest more in rebuilding inventories, moves that would help manufacturers and spur growth. Even so, factory employment, with millions of jobs lost in the last three years, will probably remain a sore spot, the economists say.
 The Commerce Department also reported that sales of new homes declined 1.7 percent in January, to a seasonally adjusted annual pace of 1.1 million, as winter weather affected some regions of the country. Even with the month's decline, the sales level was still considered healthy and exceeded economists' expectations. January sales were running 9.6 percent higher than in January 2003.

HEADLINE: Funds Want Oil Companies To Report On Climate

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Pension fund managers representing public employees in Connecticut, New York, Maine and New York City said yesterday that they had filed shareholder resolutions calling on 10 North American oil companies to report to investors on their plans to deal with the potential impact of global warming and related climate change on their businesses.
 The resolutions added the heft of some of the nation's largest investors to the ranks of shareholder activists who have been using resolutions to confront the petroleum industry on climate change issues. The resolutions also took aim at a broader range of companies, including midsize oil companies like Anadarko Petroleum, Devon Energy and Valero Energy that previously had flown below the radar of the activists. 
 ''This is the first climate change-related resolution we have filed,'' said Alan G. Hevesi, the New York State comptroller, who as the sole fiduciary of the New York Common Retirement Fund, manages the second-largest public pension fund in the nation after the California fund. ''I believe it's going to become a major issue for institutional investors.''
 Andrew Logan, the oil industry analyst at the Coalition for Environmentally Responsible Economies, said the inclusion of smaller companies, which focus on exploration and production of oil and gas, reflected the sense that they could be more vulnerable than the more diversified giants like Exxon Mobil and ChevronTexaco to regulatory changes and taxes on greenhouse gas emissions. 
 The coalition is an umbrella group of environmental organizations and businesses that has been coordinating the shareholder efforts along with the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, a coalition of 275 religious institutional investors. 
 Many oil companies have asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to rule that there is no need to present the resolutions to shareholders at their annual meetings. ''We feel we have already been responsive to these queries in a number of forums, most recently in our energy trends report posted on our Web site early this month,'' a spokeswoman for Exxon Mobil, Lauren Kerr, said.
 A spokeswoman for Anadarko, Teresa Wong, said the company expected to put the resolution to a shareholder vote but would urge investors to oppose the requested study as a waste of money. She said that the company, which is based in The Woodlands, a Houston suburb, had taken steps to address the climate change issue. One project in Wyoming, for example, uses a process that injects carbon dioxide into the ground to increase production at a century-old oil field while keeping the gas out of the atmosphere where it could contribute to global warming.
 Over all, shareholders have filed 51 resolutions so far this year calling on various companies to respond to energy and environmental issues, according to the Investor Responsibility Research Center, a company in Washington that tracks such activity. The resolutions address diverse concerns like waste from nuclear power plants, toxic emissions from chemical companies and recycling, but about half deal with climate change, which has emerged in the last three years as the most widespread concern, said Meg Voorhes, director of the research center's social responsibility service.

HEADLINE: IRAQI AYATOLLAH INSISTS ON VOTE BY END OF YEAR

BYLINE: By DEXTER FILKINS; John F. Burns contributed reporting from Baghdad for this article.

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, Iraq's most powerful religious leader, demanded Thursday that nationwide elections be held by the end of the year, but dropped his earlier insistence on holding them before the United States transfers sovereignty to the Iraqis on June 30. 
 In a statement released by his office in Najaf, Ayatollah Sistani called for ''clear guarantees,'' possibly in the form of a resolution by the United Nations Security Council, that elections would be held in 2004. He said the caretaker government that is likely to take control of the country from the Americans at the end of June should confine itself to an agenda largely limited to setting up the elections.
 ''The period in which an unelected government should take control of this country must be short and for few months only,'' the ayatollah said. 
 His remarks increased pressure on the United Nations, the United States and Iraq's American-appointed leaders to get to work immediately on setting up the elections. There is no firm plan on how to do so, or for what shape the caretaker government would take after June 30. Nor is it clear how such a government would have the power to administer a country faced with violence and growing religious and ethnic differences. 
 The United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, said last week that the earliest date for elections would be the end of this year, provided planning begins immediately. But he also implied that it would be difficult to stay on that timetable and suggested that elections could be held later in 2005. 
 Although Ayatollah Sistani has long maintained that he and other Shiite leaders should remain aloof from the give-and-take of politics, he is not hesitating to use his moral authority to affect decisions that will shape Iraq's future. 
 His remarks last month forced the United States to abandon a plan to hand over sovereignty through a system of nationwide caucuses. And it was his pleas that brought the United Nations back to Iraq after it had largely pulled out following the deadly truck-bombing of its headquarters in Baghdad last August. 
 A team of United Nations experts who visited Iraq issued a report last week concluding it would not be feasible to hold credible elections before June 30. The United States argued that Iraq lacked a roster of voters and other fundamental elements that could make elections possible. 
 In his statement on Thursday, Ayatollah Sistani said he accepted the United Nations team's assessment. He did not spell out any design for the caretaker government. 
 The 25 members of the Iraqi Governing Council are drafting a temporary constitution that is supposed to lay out the shape of the government. 
 Ayatollah Sistani, leader of the country's Shiite Muslims, said the elections should select members of a national assembly, which could then draft a permanent constitution.
 ''Although the team has dismissed the idea of handing sovereignty over to an elected government, its decision that it is possible to hold elections at the end of this year is extremely important,'' the statement said.
 Before issuing his statement, Ayatollah Sistani met for more than an hour with five Shiite members of the Iraqi Governing Council. It was not clear what was discussed. 
 Mr. Annan said last week that one of the first necessary steps would be to have an election commission establish the rules and structure for a national vote. After that, he said, it would take at least eight months to set up polling places and other election hardware. 
 ''We support the statement made by Sistani in all its details,'' Mowaffak al-Rubaie, a member of the Governing Council, said after the meeting. ''We have been blessed by visiting Sistani, and we took instructions from him.'' He gave no other details. 
 Officials at the United Nations said Thursday they would withhold publ comment on Ayatollah Sistani's statement. 
 While Iraqi leaders continue to wrestle with the timing and structure of the elections, they are also working to resolve several other potentially divisive issues, including an interim constitution, due on Saturday, and a status-of-forces agreement for the continuing presence of American troops, due by March. 
 The negotiations over the temporary constitution have been riven by disagreements over several issues, including the role of Islam in politics and the degree of autonomy that should be granted to the Kurdish people in the north. 
 Dan Senor, a spokesman for the civilian administrators here, predicted that the Iraqis would complete their work by their deadline Saturday. But he suggested that some important elements of the document might be left for later.
 ''It doesn't have to cover everything,'' Mr. Senor said of the temporary constitution. ''But it certainly has to include the separation of powers, an independent judiciary. We believe that federalism should be addressed.'' 
 Ayatollah Sistani is said to be closely watching the debates over the interim constitution and is presumed by many people to have an effective veto power over it. 
 American occupation officials have pressed ahead rapidly with plans to pull back from the country's major cities, including Baghdad, and to hand over responsibility for much of the security to Iraq's reconstituted police, civil defense force and army. 
 The American military commander in Iraq, Lt. Gen Ricardo Sanchez, said at a news conference in Baghdad today that he expected the pullback of United States units to camps outside the cities, or on the cities' outskirts, to take place by ''mid- to late April,'' two months ahead of the date for the sovereignty transfer. But he said any Iraqi resistance groups planning to exploit the pullback ''will be making a deadly error,'' because American troops will remain poised with ''quick-reaction forces'' to strike against any attackers inside the cities. 
 ''Let me emphasize that this does not mean that we are not going to be in the cities,'' General Sanchez said, outlining plans for American troops to mount joint patrols with Iraqi security forces and to conduct any other military operations inside the cities that are judged necessary. 
 He gave a cautiously optimistic assessment of American progress in the war, saying he was confident that the new Iraqi political structures could be successfully defended by American and Iraqi forces and their allied partners. He refused to be drawn out on the question of whether American troop commanders considered the June 30 date for the sovereignty transfer to be too hasty -- a view common among other American officers in Iraq -- saying that the date was fixed. 
 But when he was pressed on the challenges American troops may face after June 30, he offered a mixed view. ''The security situation is manageable whatever governance situation there may be.'' 
 Later, he was more cautious. ''Is it possible the country could move to civil war, and U.S. forces could end up having to separate ethnic groups?'' he said. ''I think it's possible, but I don't think it's likely.'' 
 Allied officials who spoke with reporters later said United States commanders were continuing to prepare for the risk of increasing attacks as June 30 neared, both by groups loyal to Saddam Hussein and Islamic terrorists -- ''either from people who are looking back to things as they used to be, or looking forward to a sort of apocalyptic, extremist country'' like Afghanistan under the Taliban, as one official put it. 
 But General Sanchez said he was confident that historians would judge American military operations in Iraq favorably, once the mission ends, whenever that may be. Inside a year since Mr. Hussein was toppled, he said, the American occupation had defeated a dictatorial government, ''taken care of the defeated'' by restoring basic freedoms and starting an economic revival, and laid down plans for a return of sovereignty. ''It will be a remarkable case study in what a powerful, benevolent army can do,'' he said.

 BODY:
A few old friends dropped in on an old friend for dinner the other night, after a long absence. This sort of thing happens in New York all the time. New experiences come calling. We lose track, and then catching up is hard. It's awkward. 
 Particularly in the case of Zoe, the once rollicking ''new American'' restaurant that Thalia and Stephen Loffredo opened in 1992, when the economy was accelerating back up from the crash of '87, and SoHo was still only on the cusp of becoming a mall. Back then, Zoe's open kitchen and wood-fired oven were something new for Manhattan, something amazing and Californian and cool. Back then, when Zoe had both those and an impudent, brave, all-American wine list, the restaurant was on the knife's edge of hip. Really.
 Now, of course, there are a lot of bag-toting tourists eating fried calamari at lunch and half-full desolation in the dining room at dinner, and even if the food isn't ever bad, it does not often play well in the mouth. There's still that staggeringly expensive, though very good, wine list. That wood oven is still there, still delightful and warm and inviting after more than a decade. But the restaurant is like a Broadway actor performing in summer-stock Sondheim. It needs an infusion of verve, and audiences that know what they're seeing.
 An example. Why are the lunchtime pizzas -- once Puckish in design, crisped and delightful and thin -- served so woefully underdone now? Is it because they're easier to fold that way, and eat in the manner of something from a Ray's on the street corner?
 Or is it because they're made by rote, by clock punchers eager for the end of the shift? Either way it's depressing. Zoe can do much better, and does.
 There is on the dinner menu a perfectly excellent rendition of slow-roasted duck. It has crispy skin and meltingly tender meat and is served above a pretty and flavorful stir fry of Chinese long beans (very good), lotus root (bad idea), shiitakes (well, a shiitake, to be precise) and shunkyo (it's a kind of radish). Absent the lotus root, and served alongside some delicious polenta fries, it's the sort of entree that could be a calling card: a steak frites for the new American bistro. But ask a waiter about it. ''It's O.K.,'' ours said before the meal, looking blank.
 Ten minutes later a busboy brought the table a plate of fried calamari. 
 ''Yours?'' he asked. We shook our heads, no.
 Zoe, 90 Prince Street, between Broadway and Mercer Street, SoHo, (212) 966-6722. Entrees, $17.75 to $29.75.

HEADLINE: A Box-Office Bonanza of $23.5 Million for 'Passion' on Opening Day

BYLINE: By SHARON WAXMAN

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
Fueled by national controversy and an Ash Wednesday opening, ''The Passion of the Christ,'' Mel Gibson's new film about the Crucifixion, took in $23.5 million at the box office on its opening day.
 The figure was the fifth-largest Wednesday opening in Hollywood history. ''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'' holds first place, having opened in December with $34.4 million, and second is ''Star Wars: Episode I, the Phantom Menace,'' which took in $31.36 million, adjusted for inflation, on its first day in 1999. Industry experts agreed that the box-office figure was astonishing for an extremely violent, R-rated, religious film in Aramaic and Latin with English subtitles. 
 ''This number would be impressive for a mainstream blockbuster, let alone a subtitled historical-religious epic,'' said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations, which tracks ticket sales. ''This shows the power of public discourse with regard to religious topics and the effect a full-blown media blitz can have on the public.''
 The movie, which has become a social and cultural phenomenon and sparked a raging debate over whether the graphic depiction of Jesus' death could reignite anti-Semitism, opened on 4,600 screens in 3,006 theaters on Wednesday. The film took in $3 million more in advance screenings on Monday and Tuesday.
 Bob Berney, president of Newmarket Films, which is distributing the picture, said he expected the number of theaters to increase slightly next week because of the intense interest. The film is already moving to more screens on Friday, for a total of 4,793 in 3,043 theaters.
 ''The success of the film so far is incredible, and it's across the board,'' Mr. Berney said. He added that theaters were packed not just in Bible Belt cities like Houston and Oklahoma City, but also at the AMC theater on 42nd Street in Manhattan and the soaring ArcLight Cinemas in Hollywood. It was unclear if the film would sustain its huge opening-day numbers through the weekend. Mr. Berney said Thursday ticket sales were $2 million by 8 a.m. but would probably not reach Wednesday's total. Some producers and studio executives, looking at the numbers, said the film would probably take in $75 million by the close of the weekend and, if attendance continued to hold up, could take in as much as $100 million in the first five days.
 ''My feeling is these people will go back more than once,'' Mr. Berney said. ''And with this kind of number, people who are not part of churches will go just out of feeling that they've got to see it, a curiosity.''
 He predicted that attendance would not drop off radically, as happens with many films that spark heavy initial interest. ''I don't know how long it will go,'' he said, ''but there will be enough repeat business to sustain it for quite a while.''

Papal Statement Is Urged
 JERUSALEM, Feb. 26 (AP) -- One of Israel's two chief rabbis urged Pope John Paul II on Thursday to reaffirm publicly that Jews are not to blame for the death of Jesus, saying he fears that Mel Gibson's film ''The Passion of the Christ'' could revive such beliefs.
 The Ashkenazi chief rabbi, Yona Metzger, said he was sending a letter to the pope asking him to reiterate a Roman Catholic Church decision in the 1960's that reversed the centuries-old doctrine that Jews were behind the Crucifixion.
 Vatican officials responded by saying the church's opposition to anti-Semitism is clear, as expressed by its 1965 document on the matter. They added that the pope has on many occasions reiterated this view, notably when he visited Israel in 2000 and when he went to the synagogue in Rome in 1986.

HEADLINE: Where the Angels of a Secular Era Can Materialize and Multiply

BYLINE: By John Rockwell

 BODY:
The other day I found myself in a cab driving up the F.D.R. Drive in Manhattan. To my right, wintry and wind-swept in the middle of the East River, appeared the southern tip of Roosevelt Island. I remembered back to July, when I found myself on that same island, its southern end then green and summery. I had been at the starting point for the British director Deborah Warner's ''Angel Project,'' part of the Lincoln Center Festival. Audience members were sent off by themselves on staggered rounds, following directions from place to place, at each of which they were greeted by intimations of angels.
 At the time, I was fascinated by Ms. Warner's piece of metropolitan installation art but not moved by it. Some bits were really clever, like finding container after container of tattered Christian books inside an abandoned Peep-o-Rama on 42nd Street, or a spectacular room full of white angel-feathers, or the final vista from an upper floor of the Chrysler Building of the city below, with actors playing angels sitting in the windows, poised wearily for flight, and with the distant view of the southern tip of Roosevelt Island to the east. Oddly, I missed the solitary missionary-lady-angel standing on the island in the middle of Times Square, though I saw her later and wondered who she was. Other intimations seemed to me too subtle or too obvious. 
 Yet as I whizzed along the F.D.R. Drive I realized how much Ms. Warner's imagery had stuck with me, how much resonance it had. And then I began to think of the ever-presence of angels now among us, and how they might best be manifested -- short of literally -- in our secular modern age.
 No point in making a comprehensive list of modern-day angelic manifestations; anyone could add more. But just for example, there was of course ''Angels in America,'' which enjoyed a new life this season on HBO. One thought back to Wim Wenders's film ''Wings of Desire,'' with Bruno Ganz as a sad-eyed angel in the modern world. ''Charlie's Angels'' brings another, perhaps less austerely religious, twist to the idea. More literally, ''Touched by an Angel,'' about angels in modern dress doing good deeds, was a popular television show in the 90's.
 Olivier Messiaen's opera ''St. Francois d'Assise,'' with its high-lying soprano angel (Dawn Upshaw in Salzburg, Laura Aikin in San Francisco), has been performed with ever-increasing frequency on stages around the world. Gerard Mortier's Ruhr Triennale festival last summer in Germany had angels as a recurrent theme, topped by the American video artist Bill Viola's amazing installation in a gigantic decommissioned natural-gas tank called ''Five Angels for the Millennium.'' And then we have the television show ''Angel,'' a ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' spinoff with David Boreanaz as a vampire with a heart.
 By now we've come a long way from feathery apparitions full of light and goodness, protecting their charges (guardian angels) or making apocalyptic prophecies: Tony Kushner's angel has plenty of imposing biblical precedents extended into art by the likes of Dante and Milton. Read up on angels and you discover a whole cosmology of creatures: levels and inner and outer circles and cast-out (''dark'') angels, headed by Satan himself, with Mr. Boreanaz as a foot soldier. Roman Catholic and Orthodox angels. Jewish and Muslim angels. By and large, mainstream American Protestantism has been less concerned with angelic iconography, although Mr. Kushner's Mormon angel proved that they still have life in the heartland. 
 Let's stick with luminosity, of the kind celebrated by Ms. Warner and Messiaen, and extending beyond angels proper to all kinds of supernatural apparitions. One explanation for their current omnipresence, Messiaen himself might have hoped, would be a return of spiritual fervor, in direct challenge to what I called above our secular modern age. Certainly the rise of religious extremism all over the world might explains angels' new-found ubiquity.
 Another explanation, both for renewed religious extremism and for the mostly benign angels in our serious and popular art, might be the sheer scary confusion in which we live. Mr. Kushner, when he first wrote ''Angels in America,'' had the AIDS epidemic to worry about, and it hasn't gone away. Now we have terrorism and economic crises and avian flu and SARS and God knows what else.
 John Simon, in a typical rant, denounced Ms. Warner's ''Angel Project'' as an artsified capitulation to the worst instincts of what he called ''a society adrift,'' referring to television shows and movies ''featuring angels in the hokiest, trashiest patent-medicine-mongering way: snake oil for the mindless mind.'' As usual, I take a rather more forgiving view of things than Mr. Simon does. As a card-carrying secular humanist, I still find feathery angel imagery comforting or disturbing or thrilling, in the right hands. But whose hands are the right ones?
 The best answer, I think, is artists who practice indirection. Perhaps not so indirect as Ms. Warner's sometimes cryptic allusions, but nowhere near so obvious as the latest computer-manipulated filmic wizardry. We respond to the miraculous when it's edified by art. As with Jupiter and Semele, or Lohengrin and Elsa, maybe a direct experience of the divine is too overwhelming. Or maybe it's just that over-literal art looks cheesy. To see Emma Thompson in the television ''Angels in America'' flailing about melodramatically, abetted by all those special effects, was less overwhelming than Ellen McLaughlin crashing through the ceiling on Broadway, hovering in mid-air and dazzling with light. To see an image of Christ on the cross in a Gothic cathedral may be more moving than Mel Gibson's hyper-real Hollywood actor in ''The Passion of the Christ,'' lashed and scourged.
 Ms. McLaughlin's impact was augmented by a kind of technology refined for the modern age but harking back to the birth of theater: the actor suspended by a wire or a rope. Her rig had been upgraded from, say, Mary Martin's as Peter Pan, by a harness that allowed her to spin in mid-air. Since then, choreographers have best exploited that technology, usually provided by Flying by Foy. There was Trisha Brown's suspended dancer in the Prologue of her production of Monteverdi's opera ''Orfeo'' five years ago at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, an angel in all but name. And just recently there have been Martha Clarke's elegantly flying Fairies in her staging of Shakespeare's ''Midsummer Night's Dream'' at the American Repertory Theater at Harvard. Again, not angels per se, more Willis out of the ballet ''Giselle,'' but dazzling in their airborne delicacy and grace.
 Seeing Ms. Clarke's dancers, twisting and turning in the air, taking impossibly long balletic leaps, landing on a dime in whatever position they wanted, all the while manipulated by very visible technicians hauling on ropes in the wings, was pretty darn close to miraculous. It was as if Ms. McLaughlin's angel had been at last freed from all earthly constraints. And it took the mysterious alchemy of the theater, not the legerdemain of modern-day film technology, to make me, at least, almost believe.

HEADLINE: Shares Mixed as Investors' February Doldrums Persist

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Technology shares rose slightly yesterday while blue chips were close to unchanged as mixed economic reports kept a lid on investor enthusiasm in a market that has lost steam in recent weeks.
 On Wednesday, major stock gauges snapped a five-session streak of declines, but optimism waned yesterday on news that first-time claims for state unemployment benefits rose, while orders for durable goods, like planes and cars, fell. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average slipped 21.48 points, or 0.20 percent, to 10,580.14. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.24 points, or 0.11 percent, to 1,144.91. The Nasdaq composite index gained 9.59 points, or 0.47 percent, to 2,032.57. 
 A report released early yesterday showed that orders for durable goods -- items meant to last three years or more -- slid 1.8 percent last month. An upward revision to December's data, however, helped take the sting out of the volatile report. The Labor Department also said that first-time claims for state unemployment benefits rose 6,000 last week, to 350,000. That was in line with economists' expectations.
 United Technologies was the biggest drag on the Dow, falling $2.42, or 2.6 percent, to $89.88. Boeing fell $1.38, or 3.2 percent, to $42.44. Traders said both companies would probably suffer from decreased military spending in the event of a Democratic victory in elections later this year. Furthermore, both are still suffering from the Army's decision on Monday to cancel the $39 billion Comanche helicopter project, a joint venture of Boeing and Sikorsky, a unit of United Technology.
 Industrial Services of America, the waste management consultant, said it approved a two-for-one split of its common stock. Its shares soared $5.41, or 27 percent, to $25.31 on the Nasdaq.
 Another economic report showed sales of new homes in the United States fell in January to the lowest level since May, but they still beat expectations as the housing market slowed only slightly.
 Shares of home builders rose after the data and helped support the market. Pulte Homes jumped $3.16, or 6.7 percent, to $50.21, after it said it was aiming for annual growth of 20 percent or more in earnings per share over the next three years. The S. &P. home building index rose 3.5 percent, making it one of the leading sectors.
 Trading was moderate, with 1.39 billion shares changing hands on the Big Board, near the 1.4 billion daily average for last year. About 1.75 billion shares were traded on Nasdaq, just short of the 1.8 billion daily average last year. 
 Treasury prices fell yesterday as a rise in the dollar convinced traders that Asian central banks would feel little need to intervene in the currency markets and invest the proceeds in United States debt. By late in the day, the price of the benchmark 10-year note dropped 6/32, to 9923/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 4.04 percent from 4.01 percent on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: 'Alila'

BYLINE: By STEPHEN HOLDEN

 BODY:

Directed by Amos Gitai
In Hebrew, with English subtitles
Not rated, 123 minutes
 The Israeli filmmaker Amos Gitai is an acerbic social critic who likes to point fingers and pick at warts, and ''Alila,'' his acidly comic study of life in a flimsy Tel Aviv apartment complex, is a sour urban mosaic whose seedy characters, try as they might, can't get out of one another's faces. Their residence, jerry-built in a dreary working-class section of Tel Aviv, is anything but a sleek, well-appointed urban retreat basking in the sunlight; a grubby housing development baking in the heat is more like it.
 The building's walls are so thin that everyone's private business is made public. In one grotesquely funny scene, Hezi (Amos Lavie), a secretive older man, carries on a flaming affair with Gabi (Yael Abecassis), a masochistic young woman besotted with his macho self-assurance. Everyone knows about the relationship because even a hand clamped over a mouth can't silence the couple's raucous lovemaking. The affair has no future. The moment Gabi begins to clutch at her brutal lover, he begins to withdraw.
 The movie, loosely adapted from Yehoshua Knaz's novel ''Returning Lost Loves,'' tries to juggle too many characters at once (its title means ''story plot'' in Hebrew), and in several cases their connections aren't adequately explained. A builder, Ezra (Uri Klauzner), whose illegally employed Chinese assistants toil noisily and at all hours on an unlicensed expansion of the apartment into the courtyard, has a sullen cream puff of a son, Eyal (Amit Mestechkin), who deserts the army and hides out in the city's red-light district.
 A stern ex-army officer, Ezra and his divorced wife, Mali (Hanna Laslo), clash bitterly about Eyal's cowardice. The father wants to disown him, but the mother is forgiving, and the surprise upshot of the boy's desertion is one of the story's unconvincing plot turns.
 Disgustedly observing the chaos is Schwartz (Yosef Carmon), a doddering Holocaust survivor on the brink of senility, whose peace is shattered by the apartment's expansion. When that expansion hits a snag, he is deliriously happy, his faculties miraculously restored.
 There really isn't a likable character in the movie, which opens today in Manhattan. The filmmaker's jaundiced view of humanity is matched by his eye for the ugly. This section of Tel Aviv is a place of dirt and mud and noise. Its physical desolation is matched by the insensitive behavior of characters hellbent on pursuing their personal agendas.
 In the filmmaker's view of Tel Aviv (and perhaps of Israel in general), the social contract that gave birth to modern Israel is coming unraveled, and a desperate each-man-for-himself greed has taken over. A production note informs us that there are 300,000 illegal immigrant workers from Asia, Romania, Ghana and Nigeria in contemporary Israel. And the movie conveys the sense of Tel Aviv as the flashpoint for all this diversity.
 Beneath the prevailing selfishness lurks the anxiety of living in a guerrilla war zone where news of suicide bombings and other acts of terrorism are reported matter-of-factly on the news all day, every day. If ''Alila'' shows a city teeming with life, it also suggests a place where no peace is to be had. STEPHEN HOLDEN

HEADLINE: Advocates for Immigrants Scorn Bush Policy on Haitian Refugees

BYLINE: By RACHEL L. SWARNS

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
Advocates for immigrants, and more than two dozen Democrats in Congress, criticized the Bush administration on Thursday for continuing to return Haitian migrants to a country in turmoil as government officials warned that the number of Haitians taking to the seas had begun to surge.
 Coast Guard officials said they had picked up 695 Haitians at sea this month, including a freighter carrying 21 Haitians that was stopped seven miles off Miami on Wednesday. 
 The figure for February alone exceeds the number of Haitians interdicted during the first four months of the last fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30, 2003, and provides the first indication that growing numbers of people have begun to flee. 
 Officials said about 500 migrants were being held aboard Coast Guard cutters on Thursday and would be sent back to Haiti on Friday. At least three people, who expressed fear of persecution in Haiti, have been sent to the American naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The rest have been returned to Haiti.
 Government officials say they plan to continue deporting illegal immigrants and those caught at sea, saying the overwhelming majority of Haitian migrants are fleeing poverty, not political repression.
 But advocacy groups and several members of Congress argue that the government is denying refugees fair access to the American asylum process. They said the government should not send Haitians home when it has deemed the country dangerous enough to evacuate non-essential personnel and deploy marines to guard the American Embassy.
 ''To send people back into the kind of killing field that Haiti has descended to is a violation of all that refugee status and humanitarianism calls for,'' Senator Bob Graham, Democrat of Florida, said in a telephone interview.
 Coast Guard officials have returned at least 233 Haitians caught fleeing Haiti by boat since Dec. 30.
 Bill Strassberger, a spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security, said Haitians living in the United States illegally would continue to be deported and those picked up at sea would continue to be sent back, unless they presented a well-founded fear of persecution. Advocates for immigrants said they feared that the government was abdicating its responsibilities to Haitian refugees.
 President Bush said Wednesday that American officials would ''turn back any refugee that attempts to reach our shore'' from Haiti.
 Eleanor Acer, asylum director for Human Rights First, said, ''It sends a very clear message that the U.S. is not willing to step up and accept its legal and moral obligation to accept refugees, particularly when the refugees at issue are at our own doorstep.'' Immigration officials said they believed that Mr. Bush had misspoken. They said they were screening Haitians migrants and sending economic migrants back to Haiti.

HEADLINE: Mexico Media Mogul Follows the Money

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
The social event of the Mexican season takes place this Saturday and Wall Street analysts are paying unusual attention. 
 Emilio Azcarraga Jean, the chairman of the Mexican media giant Grupo Televisa, will wed Sharon Fastlicht before 1,300 guests in the garden of his home in this city's western suburbs. After a honeymoon in Asia, the couple will move to Miami.
 Why would the chief executive of the world's largest Spanish-language media company take up residence in the United States? Because that is where Televisa's fastest-growing market is. 
 Mr. Azcarraga, 36, has long said he wants to find a way to expand Televisa's reach into the Hispanic market in the United States. Televisa now owns 11 percent of Univision Communications, the leading Spanish-language television network in the United States, and provides Univision with much of its programming. 
 Because Federal Communications Commission restrictions limit foreign ownership of United States broadcasters to 25 percent, Mr. Azcarraga would need an American passport if he were to seek control of the company.
 Last year, Mr. Azcarraga began publicly musing on the possibility of seeking United States citizenship. Many Wall Street analysts -- citing the Australian-born Rupert Murdoch's pursuit of American nationality to create the Fox Network -- have been quick to pounce on Mr. Azcarraga's move to Miami as the first step in the lengthy process of becoming an American. 
 ''The popular speculation sees a plot line where Emilio pursues American citizenship with an eye on acquiring Univision several years later,'' said Leland Westerfield, a media analyst with Jefferies & Company in New York. ''Is that a fiction? We don't know yet.'' 
 Mr. Azcarraga said this month that Televisa was looking at different ways of expanding its reach. ''Today, we have a partnership with Univision, which is an American group,'' he said during an informal meeting with university students, suggesting that growth could come through joint projects. ''Another possibility is obtaining double nationality and one more is to grow with other partners. We still have not decided which is the best option for Televisa.''
 Some analysts have said that Mr. Azcarraga's 24-year-old bride is American, arguing that that might speed up the application, which would take at least five years. But like Televisa's breathy soap operas, this too is fiction: Ms. Fastlicht is Mexican, she confirmed in a telephone interview. 
 Through a licensing deal with Univision, Televisa has already proved the appeal of its programming in the United States, where almost 60 percent of the Hispanic population is of Mexican origin. Televisa's programming -- particularly its rags-to-riches soap operas, or telenovelas -- have become the prime-time staple in Spanish-speaking households from New York to Los Angeles. 
 The second Spanish-language network, Telemundo, owned by NBC, lags far behind.
 ''One way to look at the Televisa-Univision alliance is as a unified vertical media company with manufacturing in Mexico City and distribution in the U.S.,'' Mr. Westerfield said. 
 The Univision agreement earned Televisa $96 million last year, just a fraction of its total revenue of $2.14 billion, according to the company's fourth-quarter earnings announced on Wednesday. Profit more than tripled, to $326 million. 
 Nearly all of Televisa's earnings come from its operations in Mexico, where it controls four television networks, accounting for two-thirds of all TV ad spending. The company is Mexico's largest magazine publisher, a leading player in radio and the dominant company in pay television.
 With Mexican economic growth tepid and the company too large to acquire any major business at home without bumping up against antitrust authorities, the only way it can grow is to expand abroad. 
 The United States Hispanic market is the natural outlet. Advertising dollars directed at Hispanics in the United States are expected to surpass all of Mexico's ad spending by next year.
 ''Our main objective is to grow both organically and through acquisitions, especially in the U.S. Hispanic market,'' said Alfonso de Angoitia, executive vice president at Televisa and Mr. Azcarraga's top lieutenant. 
 ''The U.S. Hispanic market is very attractive for us,'' he said in a conference call with investors on Thursday. ''I think we have demonstrated that we know a lot about that market and our products are very successful in the U.S.''
 Since Mr. Azcarraga took over Televisa on his father's death in 1997, he has been clear that his ambitions for the company his grandfather founded reach beyond Mexico. 
 But first he needed to get the company in shape. He restructured $1.8 billion in debt and set about paring costs and remaking the virtual fiefdom his autocratic father, Emilio Azcarraga Milmo, left behind. He has more than doubled margins, reduced head count from 20,000 to fewer than 13,000 employees and cut administrative expenses by two-thirds. 
 The result of the efficiency drive is that Televisa now has some $1 billion in cash to use in making acquisitions. 
 In public, however, Mr. de Angoitia is more cautious than his boss about expansion, a sign that Televisa fears that any dramatic move on Univision now would rattle investors.
 ''If we don't spot anything that is in our core business and that represents a growth opportunity basically in the U.S. market and that is not dilutive to our shareholders, we would pay much larger dividends and-or buy back our stock,'' he said. The company plans to pay a one-time dividend of about $136 million in the second quarter.
 Beyond the citizenship requirement, there are plenty of obstacles to Televisa's acquiring a larger stake in Univision, analysts say. Univision, which reported sales of $1.3 billion last year and net income of $155 million, trades at a large premium to Televisa. Buying expensive Univision stock would dilute the value of Televisa's assets for its shareholders, analysts say. 
 Speculation centers on whether Mr. Azcarraga might eventually reach a deal to buy the shares held by A. Jerrold Perenchio, the 73-year-old Los Angeles media entrepreneur and Univision's controlling shareholder. 
 ''I don't think Univision is anywhere near where he would sell it,'' said David Joyce, an analyst at Guzman & Company in Miami. Univision's market capitalization is about $12.5 billion and analysts say Televisa's only other option would be to spend as much as $4 billion in the market to acquire enough shares to gain control. 
 But Televisa actually does not have that many ways to expand in the United States. It is already developing new pay television channels with Univision and is selling them to cable operators in the United States that want to increase anemic subscription rates among Spanish speakers. 
 Spanish-language magazine and newspaper publishing is another area where Televisa could expand in the United States, analysts say. 
 In fact, the Televisa contract with Univision in the United States hamstrings the company. Univision has exclusive rights to Televisa's programs until 2017. If Televisa wants to move boldly into Hispanic media in the United States, its most likely path would be to take a bigger stake in Univision, analysts say.
 Mr. Azcarraga appears unlikely to seek incremental growth. And given his relative youth, he seems willing to wait.
 In a November interview with Bloomberg News, he envisioned a Televisa-Univision merger: ''If we could be one company, you would have a North American Spanish-speaking entertainment company. That's something in the long term we would like to achieve.''

HEADLINE: Ex-Aide to Blair Says the British Spied on Annan

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER

DATELINE: LONDON, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
A former member of Prime Minister Tony Blair's cabinet asserted Thursday that British intelligence services conducted electronic surveillance of the United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, in the weeks before the Iraq war.
 The former minister, Clare Short, who is still a member of Parliament, received a harsh rebuke from Mr. Blair, who told a news conference later in the day that he would not comment on any espionage operations. But he accused Ms. Short, who was the international development secretary, of endangering Britain's national security with ''totally irresponsible'' remarks. 
 At the United Nations, Mr. Annan's spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said in a news conference that the secretary general believed that it would be illegal to conduct bugging operations on the premises of the United Nations, and that he would be disappointed if Britain had done so.
 Mr. Eckhard said efforts were under way to ensure the security of Mr. Annan's confidential conversations, but he refused to say whether any bugging devices had been found during ''sweeps'' of Mr. Annan's office.
 ''We're throwing down a red flag and saying that if this is true, please stop it,'' Mr. Eckhard said.
 The news conference in New York added to the diplomatic embarrassment for Mr. Blair, who was said to be outraged that a member of his own Labor Party had spoken publicly about one of the most sensitive types of espionage in the diplomatic arena. 
 Most governments have spy agencies, and nearly all conduct espionage on friends as well as foes, but spy operations against friendly forces are rarely acknowledged. 
 Ms. Short's blunt disclosure demonstrated how difficult it has been for Mr. Blair to lay to rest the continuing public anger in Britain about the war in Iraq, despite an earlier report by Lord Hutton that cleared Mr. Blair and his aides of accusations that they manipulated intelligence to amplify the threat of Iraq's unconventional weapons. It also exposed the bitterness between Mr. Blair and a sizable group of rebels within his own party.
 Michael Howard, the Tory opposition leader, called Thursday's developments ''a complete mess'' for Britain.
 The diplomatic tempest began when Ms. Short, who initially supported the war but later resigned from the cabinet after the fall of Baghdad, told a BBC radio interviewer on Thursday morning that transcripts of Mr. Annan's private conversations circulated last year among Mr. Blair's cabinet members.
 ''I read some of the transcripts of the accounts of his conversations,'' she said, asserting that Mr. Annan's office had been bugged. ''These things are done, and in the case of Kofi's office, it's been done for some time.''
 She said she was so certain of the surveillance that she recalled ''having conversations with Kofi in the run-up to war, thinking, 'Oh dear, there will be a transcript of this and people will see what he and I are saying.' ''
 A number of experts said Ms. Short's statement violated Britain's Official Secrets Act. Her remarks reflected the continued hemorrhaging of secrets related to espionage conducted during the bitter political debate at the United Nations in March 2003 as the Bush administration and Mr. Blair's government sought to overcome resistance from France, Germany, Russia and a number of smaller countries that opposed a resolution authorizing war.
 A resolution in November 2002 gave Saddam Hussein a final opportunity to comply with demands to disarm, but some Security Council members asserted that the resolution carried no automatic authorization for war if Iraq did not comply.
 A second resolution, favored by Britain and the United States, failed, but British and American officials maintained that previous United Nations resolutions gave them the authority to invade Iraq under international law.
 The revelation of espionage in the executive suites of the United Nations building -- physically in New York City, but legally the organization's own territory -- came a day after Mr. Blair's government declined to prosecute a 29-year-old government linguist, Katharine Gun, who admitted leaking details of another bugging operation, also targeted at the United Nations, during the war debate last year. In her comments, Ms. Short drew no connection between the bugging of Mr. Annan's office and the surveillance that had been undertaken in the Gun case.
 Ms. Gun worked for the intelligence agency known as General Communications Headquarters, or GCHQ, which intercepts and decodes communications. She said she had been ''shocked'' when she received a copy of a top secret message from the United States National Security Agency requesting British assistance in conducting electronic surveillance against the diplomats of swing nations -- Angola, Cameroon, Guinea, Chile, Mexico and Pakistan -- whose votes were critical to passing a war resolution.
 She leaked the message to The London Observer and turned herself in for arrest.
 Ms. Gun's lawyers were preparing a defense that she felt it was necessary to expose what she believed was espionage activity that fell outside international law. As part of that strategy, they were going to insist on seeing the full private assessment of Lord Goldsmith, the attorney general, on whether Britain could go to war without specific authorization from the Security Council.
 Government reaction to these disclosures sharply contrasted with the era of the cold war, when significant breaches of secrecy like Ms. Gun's and Ms. Short's most often resulted in immediate censure and prosecution.
 Mr. Blair said Thursday that major threats still existed, but he offered no coherent explanation on why the government was not prosecuting these violations of the Official Secrets Act, except to say that the act perhaps needed to be reviewed.
 A number of political analysts pointed out that the prosecution of Ms. Gun, who said she had acted out of conscience to expose what she considered illegal espionage activities, would have reignited the debate over the war when Mr. Blair was trying to move the country on to a new agenda of domestic reforms.
 On Thursday Mr. Blair accused his critics of using conspiracy theories and allegations of government lying and wrongdoing as ''cover for people who want to have a debate about the rightness or wrongness of the conflict, and we should have that.''
 ''It is actually a debate on was it right to remove Saddam Hussein the way you did or should you have waited and given the inspectors more time,'' Mr. Blair said, adding, ''That is the heart of the debate.''

HEADLINE: Edwards Challenges Kerry Over Who Can Win

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY and DAVID M. HALBFINGER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
Senators John Kerry and John Edwards clashed over the death penalty and tussled with questions about gay marriage on Thursday in a lively debate that took place as the candidates headed toward the biggest day of primary voting in the Democratic nomination battle.
 For 90 minutes, seated elbow to elbow at a table in a nationally televised debate, Mr. Kerry and Mr. Edwards, the two leading contenders in the Democratic race, argued over their positions on health care and trade, the influence of lobbyists on their campaigns and their relative strengths as a general election candidate.
 At one point, Mr. Edwards expressed doubt that Mr. Kerry could defeat Mr. Bush in a series of swing states that could decide the election next fall because of some of the votes he has cast over the years. Mr. Edwards asserted that he was the candidate with a proven ability to win independent votes. 
 ''I would concede that Senator Kerry may have an advantage in New Hampshire,'' said Mr. Edwards, who represents North Carolina. ''I would not believe he has an advantage over me any place else. I think I have the advantage in these other places.''
 Under persistent questioning from a panel from CNN and The Los Angeles Times, the debate's sponsors, Mr. Edwards and Mr. Kerry expressed their opposition both to gay marriage and to President Bush's call this week for a Constitutional amendment to bar it. They struggled to deal with the divisive issue Mr. Bush has confronted them with in the midst of the Democratic primary campaign.
 ''What's happening here is this president is talking about, first, amending the United States Constitution for a problem that does not exist,'' Mr. Edwards said. ''The law today does not require one state to recognize the marriage of another state.''
 Mr. Kerry, of Massachusetts, attacked Mr. Bush for raising the issue in the first place.
 ''He's trying to polarize the nation,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''He's trying to divide America. You know, this is a president who always tries to create a cultural war and seek the lowest common denominator of American politics, because he can't come to America and talk about jobs.''
 But with the issue now at center stage, Mr. Kerry found himself in the position of defending his vote in 1996 against the Defense of Marriage Act, a law that bars federal recognition of same-sex marriages and allows each state to ignore such marriages performed in other states. He sought to reconcile his vote then with his statement this week that states should not be forced to recognize gay marriages conducted in other states.
 Mr. Kerry said he had considered the Senate debate on the legislation an instance of gay-bashing. But he said he was mistaken in 1996 when he asserted that the Defense of Marriage Act was unconstitutional. He suggested, vaguely, that he would vote against it were it to appear before Congress again. Mr. Edwards pounced on that.
 ''I would not support the Defense of Marriage Act today, if there were a vote today, which is the question you just asked Senator Kerry,'' he said. ''I'm not sure what he said about that. But I would not vote for it.''
 The debate also included Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio and the Rev. Al Sharpton. It fell short of being what might be called a tough exchange of views, but it was far more testy than any debate in weeks.
 After a year in which the candidates have been inundated with debates and forums, the liveliness of this one reflected the pressure on Mr. Edwards to try to cut into what many Democrats see as Mr. Kerry powerful lead, as well as the fact that a group of nine candidates has now shrunk to four.
 On Tuesday, voters in 10 states will take part in Democratic contests.
 At the debate, which took place at the University of Southern California, Mr. Kerry faced the most direct challenges on a position that Democrats had long feared could cause him a problem in a general election: his opposition to the death penalty, except in the case of convicted terrorists.
 One of the panelists, Larry King, in a question reminiscent of one another CNN questioner asked Michael S. Dukakis in the 1988 presidential campaign, asked Mr. Kerry if ''a person who kills a 5-year-old should live?'' Mr. Dukakis, the former governor of Massachusetts, was asked at his debate about the hypothetical rape and murder of his wife, and appeared unemotional.
 Mr. Kerry responded in a way that showed that he -- as have other Democrats who oppose the death penalty and remember that earlier debate -- had learned how to deal with that kind of question.
 ''My instinct is to want to strangle that person with my own hands,'' he said. ''I understand the instincts, I really do.'' He added: ''I prosecuted people. I know what the feeling of the families is and everybody else.
 ''But we have 111 people who have been now released from death row -- death row, let alone the rest of the prison system -- because of DNA evidence that showed they didn't commit the crime of which they were convicted.''
 A moment later, Mr. Edwards said he, too, was concerned about the risk of killing innocent people. But he expressed strong support for executions.
 ''Because, I think there are some crimes -- those men who dragged James Byrd behind that truck in Texas -- they deserve the death penalty,'' Mr. Edwards said, referring to James Byrd Jr., a black man killed in a hate crime 1997. ''And I think there are some crimes that deserve the ultimate punishment.''
 Moments later, Mr. Sharpton seized on Mr. Edwards's statement that there were problems with how the death penalty is put into effect.
 ''Senator Edwards,'' he asked, ''are you saying, since you agree that there's a lot of problems in the death penalty -- and no one has mentioned the racial disparity about those on death row -- that therefore, you would suspend your support of capital punishment until we dealt with those problems?''
 As the candidates answered repeated questions on issues like the death penalty and abortion, Mr. Kerry tried to change the topic, asserting that voters this fall would be more concerned about the economy and health care.
 ''This is not the biggest issue in front of the country, that we were just talking about,'' he said of gay marriage. ''It's not even the biggest story. The biggest story today, Larry, are 43 million Americans who have no health care.''
 But Mr. Edwards said the Democratic candidate's position on social issues would clearly affect their electability in November.
 ''People are going to consider these other things,'' Mr. Edwards said. ''And for us to assume that that's not true is just a fantasy. It's not true. We need a candidate at the top of this ticket who can connect with voters everywhere in America. And if we don't have that, we're going to be in trouble.''
 Mr. Edwards, a trial lawyer who has served in the Senate for five years, also sought repeatedly to present himself as a Washington outsider, drawing a contrast with Mr. Kerry, a four-term senator. Mr. Kerry sought to make his years in office into an asset, noting that he had more experience in government than his opponent.
 Mr. Edwards also sought to portray Mr. Kerry as beholden to lobbyists. Mr. Edwards noted that he had refused to take contributions from lobbyists or political action committee. 
 ''I think these Washington lobbyists have entirely too much influence on what happens every day,'' he said. ''It's wrong.''
 Mr. Kerry sought to turn that back on Mr. Edwards by noting the North Carolina senator's reliance on campaign contributions from fellow trial lawyers, blithely suggesting that Mr. Edwards was looking to make the most out of whatever distinctions he could find.
 ''And I don't think there fundamentally is a difference,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''I mean, John has raised almost 50 percent of his money from one group of people in the United States of America. Now I don't suggest ever suggest that he is beholden to them.''
 ''He said, ''There's not really a difference in this race between us in our commitment to get the lobbying out.''
 On trade, Mr. Kerry was asked to square his support for inexpensive clothes and goods from overseas for consumers with his support for labor unions seeking better wages and job protections.
 ''Some jobs we can't compete with,'' he said. ''I understand that. But most jobs we can.'' Mr. Edwards sought to draw a sharp a contrast on the issue by noting different votes the two men have cast on trade pacts over the years.
 Near the debate's end, Mr. Kerry and Mr. Edwards were asked to contemplate the idea of running together this fall
 ''An Edwards-Kerry ticket would be powerful,'' Mr. Edwards said.
 Mr. Kerry thanked Mr. Edwards ''for the consideration,'' but did not reciprocate.
 Mr. Kerry was then asked to name a quality of Mr. Edwards's that he wished he had himself, but appeared not to entirely grasp the question.
 ''I think he's a great communicator,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''He's a charming guy.''

HEADLINE: Mr. Greenspan's Warning

 BODY:
If the Bush administration is planning to trumpet Alan Greenspan's endorsement for making the president's tax cuts permanent, it has to accept both sides of his argument. Mr. Greenspan's warning to Congress this week that it ought to scale back spending on Social Security and other government programs to reduce looming federal deficits provides stark evidence of the awful choices facing the nation in the wake of President Bush's reckless decision to slash taxes for the wealthy.
 Mr. Greenspan, the Fed chairman, qualified his support for the permanent cuts Mr. Bush is now seeking. Congress, he said, had to find ways to offset the loss in revenue with sharp restraints on spending. Mr. Bush and his Republican allies have attempted to present that as a relatively easy choice involving reductions in discretionary domestic spending. But that would take care of only a sliver of the deficit, while harming a multitude of important and useful programs. 
 In testimony before the House Budget Committee on Wednesday, Mr. Greenspan raised a red flag about Social Security, warning that federal deficits, already large, would begin to explode after the first wave of baby boomers becomes eligible for Social Security benefits four years from now, and for Medicare three years after that. During the Clinton administration, the assumption was that part of the surplus would be used to shore up entitlements for retirees. Now the tax cuts have left the federal government practically helpless.
 Part of Mr. Greenspan's take-your-medicine solution is to reduce Social Security's spending on future retirees by raising the age of eligibility and by changing the inflation index to make payments less generous but more attuned to what he considers real increases in the cost of living. Those are responsible proposals, worthy of extended debate. But they would be extremely hard to sell to the public, and they would not be enough to solve all the looming entitlement problems.
 It is always difficult to decipher just what the often-opaque Fed chairman means. Under questioning, he acknowledged that Congress was unlikely to solve the deficit problem solely by cutting spending and would inevitably have to raise some taxes to keep deficits manageable. We took his testimony to mean that long-term deficit reduction is more important than permanent tax cuts. The White House, alas, is taking the opposite approach. It wants the tax cuts locked in before it provides any serious plan for how to restrain future deficits.

HEADLINE: The Trade Tightrope

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN. 
E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
You can't blame the Democrats for making the most of the Bush administration's message malfunction on trade and jobs. When the president's top economist suggests, even hypothetically, considering hamburger-flipping a form of manufacturing, it's a golden opportunity to accuse the White House of being out of touch with the concerns of working Americans. (''Will special sauce now be counted as a durable good?'' Representative John Dingell asks.) And the accusation sticks, because it's true.
 But the Democratic presidential candidates have to walk a tightrope. To exploit the administration's vulnerability, they must offer relief to threatened workers. But they also have to avoid falling into destructive protectionism. 
 Let me spare you the usual economist's sermon on the virtues of free trade, except to say this: although old fallacies about international trade have been making a comeback lately (yes, Senator Charles Schumer, that means you), it is as true as ever that the U.S. economy would be poorer and less productive if we turned our back on world markets. Furthermore, if the United States were to turn protectionist, other countries would follow. The result would be a less hopeful, more dangerous world.
 Yet it's bad economics to pretend that free trade is good for everyone, all the time. ''Trade often produces losers as well as winners,'' declares the best-selling textbook in international economics (by Maurice Obstfeld and yours truly). The accelerated pace of globalization means more losers as well as more winners; workers' fears that they will lose their jobs to Chinese factories and Indian call centers aren't irrational.
 Addressing those fears isn't protectionist. On the contrary, it's an essential part of any realistic political strategy in support of world trade. That's why the Nelson Report, a strongly free-trade newsletter on international affairs, recently had kind words for John Kerry. It suggested that he is basically a free trader who understands that ''without some kind of political safety valve, Congress may yet be stampeded into protectionism, which benefits no one.''
 Mr. Kerry's Wednesday speech on trade seemed consistent with that interpretation. He decried the loss of jobs to imports, but was careful not to promise too much. You might say that he proposed speed bumps, rather than outright barriers to outsourcing: rules requiring notice to employees and government agencies before jobs are shifted overseas, steps to close tax loopholes that encourage offshore operations, more aggressive enforcement of existing trade agreements, and a review of those agreements with an eye toward seeking tougher labor and environmental standards.
 I don't see anything there that threatens to unravel the world trading system. If anything, the question is whether it provides enough of a ''political safety valve.''
 The answer, I think, is yes -- but only if those modest measures on the trade front are combined with much bigger changes in domestic policy.
 First and foremost, we need more jobs. U.S. employment is at least four million short of where it should be. Imports and outsourcing didn't cause that shortfall, but if the job gap doesn't start closing soon, protectionist pressures will become irresistible.
 Beyond that, we need to do much more to help workers who lose their jobs. It didn't help the cause of free trade when Republican leaders in Congress recently allowed extended unemployment benefits to expire, even though employment is lower and long-term unemployment higher than when those benefits were introduced.
 And in the longer run, we need universal health insurance. Social justice aside, it would be a lot easier to make the case for free trade and free markets in general if, like every other major advanced country, we had a system in which workers kept their health coverage even when they happened to lose their jobs.
 The point is that free trade is politically viable only if it's backed by effective job creation measures and a strong domestic social safety net. And that suggests that free traders should be more worried by the prospect that the policies of the current administration will continue than by the possibility of a Democratic replacement.
 Put it this way: there's a reason why the two U.S. presidents who did the most to promote growth in world trade were Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman, while the two most protectionist presidents of the last 70 years have been Ronald Reagan and, yes, George W. Bush.

HEADLINE: Visiting Europe Trade Chief Warns of Sanctions Monday

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
The European Union's trade commissioner told senior American lawmakers on Thursday that the United States will face $4 billion in sanctions starting on Monday because Congress has failed to eliminate overseas tax shelters for American exporters that were declared illegal by the World Trade Organization.
 The official, Pascal Lamy, delivered a similar warning in November as the Europeans were preparing to levy sanctions against the United States for tariffs on steel imports. President Bush lifted the disputed tariffs a month later.
 But the political and economic climate has changed, and Mr. Lamy's reception in Washington this week has been markedly different. He won no assurances from senior members of Congress that competing bills aimed at resolving the problem would even reach floor debate before the spring recess. 
 Instead, the politics of the presidential campaign, with its focus on job losses and trade, has helped block any agreement. What was essentially a tax issue is now being portrayed by Republicans and Democrats as a jobs issue, and neither party wants to appear on the wrong side of that debate. 
 Even though the $4 billion in sanctions is the largest penalty ever authorized by the W.T.O., it has not elicited the same sense of outrage among Americans as the threat of the steel tariffs, in part because the potential sting of the sanctions has been blunted by the drop in the dollar's exchange rate with the euro, which has reduced the price abroad of American exports. 
 Industry is supporting legislation sponsored by Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Called the American Jobs Creation Act, the measure would eliminate the existing tax break found by the W.T.O. to be illegal and overhaul laws on international corporate taxation. But it would also compensate American manufacturers and producers with at least $61 billion in other tax breaks over the next 10 years.
 The Senate bill, sponsored by Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Finance Committee, and Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, would provide tax breaks for domestic manufacturers. Neither of the measures, however, will be enacted by the Monday deadline.
 Mr. Grassley said he told Mr. Lamy during a private meeting on Thursday that he hoped to get his bill through the Senate next week.
 ''I can't fault him for wanting the United States to abide by the W.T.O. rules,'' Mr. Grassley said, ''but we're down to crunch time. As the sanctions kick in, rising month by month, I think we'll get businesses calling us and saying, 'Get this bill passed, get this bill passed.'''
 Yet the chances that any legislation will be enacted are complicated by differences between the bills. The House measure would cost more than $60 billion while the Senate bill is revenue-neutral. 
 Mr. Grassley also says his approach would preserve more American jobs because it provides tax relief for domestic manufacturers but does not include all the tax relief for overseas operations found in Mr. Thomas's bill.
 In that respect, the Senate proposal more closely resembles an alternative measure sponsored by Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York. In a letter to President Bush, Mr. Rangel and other leading House Democrats said on Thursday that the failure of Republican lawmakers to act on this legislation amounted to a ''lose-lose proposition for American workers and businesses.''
 ''As a result, Europe is on the brink of applying punitive sanctions to American exports of key manufacturing products,'' said the letter, which was signed by Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House minority leader, and other senior lawmakers.
 Mr. Lamy told a trade association lunch here that the sanctions would begin on Monday and only be lifted ''the day Congress passes the necessary legislation.''
 He said he would have preferred that Congress repeal the export subsidies for American exports once it had lost the case on appeal two years ago.
 ''The name of this game is repeal, not retaliate and not sanction,'' Mr. Lamy said in a speech at the European-American Business Council.
 He refused to take sides on the escalating debate around the differing measures before Congress, saying only that he looked forward to working with Mr. Thomas and Mr. Grassley when each chamber had passed legislation and lawmakers were meeting to resolve their differences in conference.
 European and American officials have warned that a penalty of $4 billion could test the W.T.O. and urged that the issue be resolved quickly.
 Two years ago, after Washington lost the initial ruling, Robert B. Zoellick, the United States trade representative, said of the looming penalty that ''there's no doubt that if it starts to go into affecting that much trade, it's like using a nuclear weapon on the trading system.''
 This week, a senior European official warned it was important that the United States acknowledge the validity of the penalty and then move quickly to resolve the problem.
 ''It is a huge issue of credibility of the W.T.O. dispute-settlement system,'' the official said.
 The Europeans have promised to phase in their sanctions gradually, beginning with a 5 percent tariff and rising to a 17 percent tariff over the coming year.
 The pain will be felt primarily by American farmers and manufacturers. The Europeans will begin imposing tariffs on agricultural products, leather goods, paper, steel, nuclear reactors, machinery, carpets, clothing and other items that are directly competitive with their own products. 
 With the steel tariffs, the Europeans had identified products in states that would be critical in the presidential election, a tactic they discarded in this case, choosing instead to sanction competing American products.
 The new duties beginning in March will initially total $16.5 million a month and are scheduled to rise to $46.4 million a month in December.
 The W.T.O. approved the sanctions last May but the Europeans held off imposing them in hope that Congress would enact new legislation.

HEADLINE: Bush Continues a Tough Attack on Kerry

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

DATELINE: LOUISVILLE, Ky., Feb. 26 

 BODY:
President Bush continued his assault on Senator John Kerry on Thursday as he took his new speech to Kentucky, where he also collected hundreds of checks for a campaign that has raised more than $150 million.
 Later, Mr. Bush canceled two stops in Charlotte, N.C., because a snowstorm closed schools and government offices, and the mayor and police chief asked him to stay away. 
 ''They felt it was important not to have two large issues to deal with, so they asked that the president not come,'' Scott Stanzel, a spokesman for Mr. Bush's 2004 campaign, said. ''So we agreed with that assessment and returned to Washington.''
 Mr. Bush's half-day jaunt here was his most overtly political trip since becoming president and the first in which he directly presented himself as a candidate for the office he now holds.
 ''We're ready to go here in Kentucky, we've got a great organization,'' Mr. Bush said to 1,000 cheering supporters who paid $2,000 each at a fund-raising lunch at the Galt House in Louisville.
 Officials of the Bush-Cheney campaign said the event raised more than $1.2 million.
 Mr. Bush repeated his attack on Mr. Kerry that he started on Monday in Washington with a tough new speech that signaled that he was no longer content to be a sideshow.
 Without directly using Mr. Kerry's name, Mr. Bush said the Democrats were ''an interesting group, with a lot of strong differences of opinion.''
 ''They're for tax cuts and against them,'' the president said. ''For Nafta and against Nafta. For the Patriot Act, against the Patriot Act. In favor of liberating Iraq and opposed to it. And that's just one senator from Massachusetts.''
 Mr. Bush also implicitly said the nation would be more vulnerable to terrorist attacks under a Democratic administration.
 His opponents, Mr. Bush said, ''view terrorism more as a crime, a problem to be solved with law enforcement and indictments.''
 ''Our nation followed that approach after the World Trade Center was bombed in 1993,'' he added. ''The matter was handled in the courts and thought by some to be settled.''
 But after Sept. 11, 2001, Mr. Bush said, ''it is not enough to serve our enemies with legal papers.''
 If the United States shows weakness over the next decade, Mr. Bush warned, ''the world will drift toward tragedy.''
 ''This will not happen on my watch,'' he said.
 Mr. Bush began his day in Louisville at ISCO Industries, a manufacturer of plastic water and sewer pipes, by moderating a ''conversation'' on the state of the economy with five participants chosen by the White House. All of them said the president's tax cuts had improved their lives. One said that the extra money let him buy glasses for his daughter and that she could now see the blackboard at school. 
 Despite the good news on stage, the unemployment rate in Kentucky has increased, to 5.4 percent from 4.9 percent, since Mr. Bush took office, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The state's workforce has contracted in that period by 50,000 jobs, to 1.77 million.
 In his remarks on the economy, the president also appeared to acknowledge for the first time that he was unlikely to persuade Congress to make all his tax cuts permanent this year. He said he would push for extending cuts like the children's tax credit that expire on Dec. 31.

HEADLINE: The Hot Potato of Issues Is Dropped Anew

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
Ever since the 2000 campaign, when he began pushing the idea of shifting some Social Security taxes to private personal investment accounts, President Bush has danced around the question of whether more painful steps would also be necessary to put the retirement system on sound financial footing.
 So when Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, said on Wednesday that prudent long-term fiscal policy in the face of federal deficits would require cuts in benefits, Mr. Bush, who is headed into what looks like another close election, instantly distanced himself. 
 He restated his longstanding position that people in retirement or near retirement age should not see any change in their expected benefits and added that younger workers should be able to count on a combined benefit, from Social Security and the proposed investment accounts, at least equal to what they are promised now. 
 His own economists, though, are more explicit about what his approach to Social Security would require.
 In the latest Economic Report of the President, sent under Mr. Bush's signature this month to Congress, the White House Council of Economic Advisers recommended some reduction in the benefits promised under the current system as part of a broader overhaul that would add benefits from the personal accounts. 
 ''Reform should include moderation of the growth of benefits that are unfunded and can therefore be paid only by assessing taxes in the future,'' the report said.
 Mr. Bush's reluctance to say out loud what nearly every economist who has studied the issue says -- that there is no pain-free way to assure that Social Security remains solvent as it pays benefits to a population that is aging and living longer -- is by no means limited to the White House. 
 Both parties have spent years emphasizing that the failure to address the impending imbalances in Social Security and Medicare will imperil the government's financial condition, the economy and retirees' security. 
 With a few exceptions, neither Democrats nor Republicans have been willing to propose detailed steps to balance the retirement system's income and long-term obligations. 
 Even steps like altering cost-of-living adjustments benefits are judged by leaders in both parties to be politically poisonous, even if accompanied by the promise of income from the proposed investment accounts. 
 Republicans have ruled out tax increases as a solution.
 As a political matter, the spotlight is on Mr. Bush, who put the overhaul of Social Security on the national agenda and often says he did not take office to pass problems to future generations.
 He made the creation of personal investment accounts a major plank in his 2000 platform.
 Administration officials have said that they believe that the proposal was a winner for them in the last campaign and that they expect it to play well this year, especially with younger voters who are comfortable with investing.
 ''I think there has to be presidential leadership on this,'' said Representative Jim Kolbe, the Arizona Republican who has been a co-sponsor of a detailed plan to cut benefits and create personal accounts. ''The president should be ready to take the debate to the next level in the campaign.''
 Yet when a commission that the president appointed in 2001 reported recommendations that included cuts to the guaranteed benefit and suggested that the government would need to borrow trillions of dollars to pay for the personal accounts, Mr. Bush abandoned plans to push ahead on the issue. His response to Mr. Greenspan suggests that he again wants to avoid difficult details in this campaign year.
 Mr. Greenspan's testimony to the House Budget Committee also gave Democrats a potentially powerful new line of attack against Mr. Bush, that the deficits under this administration have grown so large and are highly likely to continue for so long that they could eat away at Social Security, the pillar of the social welfare system.
 Democrats have long campaigned as the protector of Social Security, and they contend that the issue remains a powerful club for them. At a retreat several weeks ago, former President Bill Clinton urged House Democrats to link the budget deficit to the fate of Social Security as a way of hammering home to voters the costs of Mr. Bush's tax cuts. 
 ''President Clinton at our retreat said it was a major issue we need to develop,'' Representative Robert T. Matsui, Democrat of California, said. ''In some respects, Greenspan put it on the table for us by linking it to the deficit.''
 Some members of Congress said Mr. Greenspan appeared to have deliberately raised the issue to ensure that it would be part of the election year debate. The small band of politicians who advocate moving rapidly to address the problem say his statement will intensify pressure on the Republican leadership in Congress to act.
 ''What Greenspan may have done is helped us realize that we don't have a choice of not doing anything,'' said Representative Jim DeMint, the South Carolina Republican who has proposed a personal account plan that would cost $444 billion in its first 10 years but would, he said, save taxpayers money in the long run. 
 ''The president,'' Mr. DeMint said, ''has shown as much leadership on the issue as could be expected. But the people responsible for writing the bills are running from it.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Plan for Mideast Reform Draws Ire of Arab Leaders

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN and NEIL MacFARQUHAR; Steven R. Weisman reported from Washington for this article and Neil MacFarquhar from Cairo.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
An American proposal for the world's wealthiest nations to press for economic, political and cultural changes in the Middle East has drawn harsh criticism from Arab leaders and European officials, who say the Bush administration did not consult the countries it seeks to transform.
 In addition, a Bush administration official said Thursday that some European officials had suggested they might block the initiative if there was no progress toward peace between Israel and the Palestinians.
 The administration, seeking to overcome anti-Western and anti-American sentiments in the Arab world, is circulating a draft of what it calls a ''Greater Middle East initiative.'' It hopes the idea will be adopted at the summit meeting of the eight leading industrial nations in June. 
 The draft has not been officially released, but after a copy was published earlier this month in Al Hayat, a London-based Arabic newspaper, and an English-language version was posted on its Web site, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Crown Prince Abdullah of Saudi Arabia criticized it as an attempt to dictate change.
 ''Whoever imagines that it is possible to impose solutions or reform from abroad on any society or region is delusional,'' Mr. Mubarak said on Wednesday. ''All peoples by their nature reject whoever tries to impose ideas on them.''
 Egypt's three semiofficial dailies -- Al Ahram, Al Akhbar and Al Gumhuriya -- all reported Mr. Mubarak's remarks, including another pointed statement that the Bush administration was behaving ''as if the region and its states do not exist, as if they have no people or societies, as if they have no sovereignty over their land, no ownership.''
 White House officials said it was unfortunate that the document was published before everyone could be consulted, but they believed they would secure Arab and European cooperation.
 The Washington Post and other newspapers had reported earlier this month that the administration was preparing such a plan, but its details had not been spelled out.
 Among the changes advocated by the draft paper are the establishment of business and trade zones in the Middle East, more financing for small businesses and more help conducting elections.
 In addition, the paper calls for efforts to strengthen ties between the West and nongovernmental groups that promote democracy in Arab countries. It also urges support for new education initiatives in the region, especially for women.
 The summit meeting, the paper says, should try to ''forge a long-term partnership with the Greater Middle East's reform leaders and launch a coordinated response to promote political, economic and social reform in the region.''
 Leaders from the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and Russia will be at the meeting, scheduled to take place in June at Sea Island, Ga. 
 Conspicuous by its absence in the draft is any significant increase in financial aid to the region, which might be used as leverage for effecting such changes. The centerpiece of the administration's aid program to the region, the Middle East Partnership Initiative, is providing $120 million in financial assistance this year to encourage democratic reforms. American foreign aid totals nearly $18 billion annually. 
 The administration devised its new initiative to conplement similar European efforts. The European Union announced its own program to push for democratic reforms in the region last year, much of which is similar to the American proposals. 
 The idea of putting the two efforts together is not sitting especially well in Europe. Some officials there fear that their program might be tainted by association with Washington, which is widely criticized in the region because of the war in Iraq and its perceived bias toward Israel.
 One European diplomat said the American approach, which used strong language about change and did not reflect any consultation with local governments, was likely to be seen as ''a clash of civilizations'' between the Western and Arab worlds. 
 American officials say that they have no intention of absorbing the European initiative. ''This is not an either-or situation,'' said an administration official. ''It's really a coordinating mechanism to make sure that together we make best use of our resources. I don't see a lot of turf battles going on.''
 But administration officials appear to have been surprised by the amount of criticism the draft provoked. On Tuesday, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was asked about the criticism by Egypt and Saudi Arabia on Al Hurra, the American-sponsored, Arabic-language satellite television station. He denied that the administration had ignored the governments in the region and promised that they would be consulted before the plan was presented at the Georgia summit meeting.
 ''We would never suggest a reform plan that should come from outside,'' Mr. Powell said, adding that the initiative ''must be something that is acceptable to the parties in the region'' and that the United States would consult all parties concerned. 
 ''These are sovereign nations,'' he said. ''They have their own interests to protect. They have their own people, their own culture, their own identity, their own history. What we are trying to do is help each of them, in the way that they choose, to move forward down a path that I think is in their interests to move down.''
 An Arab diplomat in Washington said he told administration officials that he did not disagree with any of the initiative's elements, but that ''it's very important how it is to be packaged.'' Further, the diplomat said, the United States is tarnished by its failure to ease the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians. 
 ''It's not the message, it's the messenger,'' he said. ''But I don't think the administration will be affected by the criticism. I don't think they regard such opinions very highly. They're going to forge ahead.''

HEADLINE: Senate Votes to Require Safety Locks on Guns

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
The Senate voted Thursday to require handgun manufacturers to sell weapons with child-proof locks.
 The measure was added to a bill the Senate is considering that would grant immunity to gun makers and dealers against civil lawsuits. Senator Barbara Boxer, the California Democrat who sponsored the amendment, described the 70-to-27 vote as ''a very strong signal'' that lawmakers would be willing to further amend the bill, despite pressure from President Bush not to do so.
 Gun makers have argued that legislative action is unneeded because they are already voluntarily moving to produce weapons with the locks. 
 The Senate passed a similar safety lock measure in 1999. But the gun bill to which it was attached did not make it out of the House because of disputes about other provisions, including how to regulate gun shows.
 On Thursday other parts of the Senate's debate over legal immunity for gun dealers and manufacturers turned into a political free-for-all. Democrats tried to use the measure as a vehicle to extend unemployment benefits, and the majority leader, Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, tried to use it to renew parts of a landmark civil rights measure. Both efforts were unsuccessful.
 The unemployment benefits extension, sponsored by Senator Maria Cantwell, Democrat of Washington, failed on a procedural motion when it fell two votes short of the 60 needed for the Senate to take it up. The civil rights amendment was withdrawn when Mr. Frist realized he did not have the votes to tack it onto the bill.
 The debate illustrates how both parties are trying to use the gun immunity bill, which has broad bipartisan support and is expected to pass the Senate easily next week, to further their political aims in an election year. In addition to the unemployment measure, Democrats have also discussed using the bill to try to overturn new overtime regulations promulgated by the Bush administration -- an issue of importance to working families.
 Dr. Frist's amendment caught many lawmakers off guard. Dr. Frist said he decided to introduce the measure, which would have made permanent certain sections of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, after a recent trip to Alabama and Tennessee with Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia. The act is set to expire in 2007. The effort fell apart after Mr. Lewis issued a statement calling Dr. Frist's maneuver admirable, but premature.
 Other Democrats were not so generous; they called the move a political ploy to give Republicans a chance to demonstrate their commitment to civil rights, while forcing Democrats who oppose the gun bill to vote against an issue dear to them. 
 ''It's a convenient way to play 'gotcha,' '' said Senator Jon Corzine, Democrat of New Jersey.
 Advocates of gun control, who would like to defeat the immunity bill, were left frustrated. ''The argument in the court of opinion needs to be about the underlying bill,'' said Richard Aborn, a former president of the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, an advocacy group.
 The bill would shield gun makers and dealers from lawsuits, so long as they do not violate laws or sell defective weapons. The industry says it needs the protection to stave off jury awards that could put manufacturers out of business. Opponents call the measure a special-interest giveaway that would deny victims their legitimate right to sue.
 The bill's backers defeated two efforts to permit certain suits to proceed even if the immunity legislation passes. The Senate rejected, by a vote of 56 to 40, an amendment permitting suits that stem from the 2002 sniper attacks in the Washington area. Lawmakers also rejected, by 56 to 38, an amendment that would allow civil suits against the industry by law enforcement officers who are victims of gun violence.
 The question now is whether the Senate will vote to add two other gun-related measures -- one to extend the so-called assault weapons ban, and another to require instant background checks of customers at gun shows -- to the immunity bill.
 The issues are starting to figure into the presidential campaign. The Senate is set to vote on them on Tuesday, a day when 10 states will hold primaries. Democrats have pressed Senators John Kerry and John Edwards, the party's presidential contenders, to be present. Spokesmen for both men said they were trying to revise their schedules.

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article yesterday about a vote by the Senate to require safety locks on guns referred incorrectly to a voluntary program to provide them. Gun manufacturers said that because they already provide the locks through the program, they did not work to defeat the amendment. They did not they were moving toward adopting such a program.

HEADLINE: Kerry Uses Edwards's Common Touch to Soften Image

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Feb. 26 

 BODY:
Senator John Kerry, who is not the son of a mill worker, is borrowing heavily from the message and manner of Senator John Edwards, who is.
 Mr. Kerry is talking nonstop about job losses, about the ''haves and have-nots,'' about hardship and heartache in the industrial heartland. He is even surrounding himself with mill workers to prove his point -- and retelling their stories about as often as Mr. Edwards mentions that he grew up in a textile town and saw the broken spirits of those whom global trade left behind. 
 Mr. Kerry's transformation into an empathetic candidate with a decidedly blue collar on his navy pinstriped suit began months ago as he struggled to connect with audiences put off by his patrician manner and emotional distance.
 It has taken on new significance, however, since the Democratic race narrowed to Mr. Kerry and Mr. Edwards, whose affability, speaking style and up-from-the-bootstraps biography stand in contrast to Mr. Kerry's Boston Brahmin image and background. And it will be even more vital, Democratic strategists say, should Mr. Kerry win the nomination and take on a president whose popularity is based largely on his regular-guy, emotionally direct appeal.
 Tony Coelho, who served as Al Gore's campaign chairman in the early part of his 2000 campaign, said Mr. Kerry seemed to have left his cerebral policy wonkishness in Iowa, where at the low point of his campaign he had nothing to lose by loosening up. ''He had a lot of Gore in him,'' Mr. Coelho said.
 If Mr. Kerry's transformation lasts, Mr. Coelho said, ''this is going to help him out tremendously against Bush, because that's what Bush has.''
 ''If Kerry, who everybody agrees has intellectual curiosity, has inner peace, he'll go against Bush, who has that, but no intellectual curiosity,'' he said.
 Mr. Coelho described that inner peace as ''being able to reach out to people, hug them, and touch them -- as opposed to being the brightest kid in class.''
 ''The danger is,'' he added, ''if it's not real, it will come out.''
 To bolster his credibility with the working class, Mr. Kerry is trying everything: touring deserted mills and still-bustling ones, talking about the plight of struggling mill and factory workers, campaigning with them at his side, exchanging hugs with tearful laborers, and assuring the countless union members whose bosses are now backing him that he will fight to keep their jobs from disappearing overseas. On Thursday he campaigned at the side of striking California grocery workers.
 The day after Mr. Edwards's strong showing in the Feb. 17 Wisconsin primary, Mr. Kerry walked past a vacant lot where an auto-parts factory once stood in Dayton, Ohio, then walked a block to a crowded forum at a United Auto Workers local. He sat between two mill workers and listened as they described their plight.
 ''I'm hanging on by a thread,'' said Vicki Johnson, an electrician who is raising a daughter.
 Lucy Hopkins, a millwright at another factory with three daughters of her own, said she had the ''job of a lifetime'' until she was laid off Nov. 30.
 ''It was like a slap in the face, like having the rug pulled out from under you,'' she said. ''I don't know what the future holds.''
 In Jamaica, Queens, on Monday, Mr. Kerry listened to Chris Gleason, a single father and plumbers' union official, complain that the Bush administration was trying to roll back labor protections like overtime pay.
 ''We're not living the life of Riley, but what we want is a fair cut,'' Mr. Gleason said. ''We're not asking for everything. When we work over 40 hours, we're entitled to our overtime pay, because right now they're taking my time away from my daughter.''
 Mr. Kerry listened intently as Mr. Gleason said he had had to leave New York to find work.
 ''Chris,'' he said, ''What did you do for child care?'' Mr. Gleason said he relied on his daughter's grandmothers.
 Mr. Kerry's moments with such workers at times seem forced, and almost always clearly delineated. Typically he steps out of his dress shoes and into duck boots, throws a barn coat over his suit, and slips into a kind of dialect heavy on ''Hey, man'' and accompanied by shoulder-clasps.
 Outside Youngstown, Ohio, on Wednesday, he tramped through a rusting, long-abandoned steel mill with a few members of the steelworkers' union who said they had been locked out of work at a titanium plant since last October.
 Randy Velk, 50, said he had diabetes and was finding it difficult to pay his $500-a-month prescription drug bills. ''I only work sporadically,'' he said. ''It's really tough.''
 Mr. Kerry said, ''That's tough, man.''
 The shut-down steel mill was mainly a photo opportunity, but many of these encounters give Mr. Kerry fodder for the kind of anecdotes he likes to use on the stump. In Iowa in October, he met a 50-year-old man named Bob Anderson, who was out of work with a sick wife and no health insurance. Mr. Anderson popped up in a speech as recently as Wednesday night in St. Paul, Minn.
 And in Toledo on Wednesday, Mr. Kerry recycled the story of Ms. Hopkins, the millwright from Dayton.
 ''You know, they didn't just ship her job to China, they took things a step further,'' Mr. Kerry said. ''They literally unbolted the equipment and shipped the equipment out piece-by-piece and reassembled it in another country, in China.''
 Kathleen Hall Jamieson, an expert on political messages and dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania, said Mr. Kerry was taking a sensible route in responding to Mr. Edwards.
 ''The only message the very wealthy Edwards has to differentiate himself is that, 'Because of my experience as a son of a mill worker, seeing unemployed mill workers my whole life, I understand what it means to not have a job','' she said. ''If Kerry demonstrates he listens and understands, he's neutralized Edwards's message.''
 Ms. Jamieson said another part of Mr. Edwards's message was that he had translated his life experience of ''understanding pain'' into advocacy for the unfortunate.
 ''But Kerry can say, 'So did I -- and it's more unusual, because given my background, you wouldn't expect me to,' '' she said.


CORRECTION-DATE: February 28, 2004

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about Senator John Kerry's attempts to soften his image gave an outdated title for Kathleen Hall Jamieson, who said he was taking a sensible route in trying to appeal to working-class voters. She is director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, no longer dean of the Annenberg School for Communication.

HEADLINE: With Last 50 Pickups, Ford Ends 56 Years of Work in Edison

BYLINE: By JANON FISHER and ROBERT HANLEY

DATELINE: EDISON, N.J., Feb. 26 

 BODY:
The Ford Motor Company ceased production at its sprawling assembly plant here on Thursday, ending 56 years as a manufacturing fixture in north-central New Jersey and stripping away yet another major name from the state's industrial base.
 The closing of operations was ceremonial and bittersweet. During a shortened final shift, workers turned out the last 50 of the nearly 1.7 million small pickup trucks the plant has produced since the early 1990's and then retired to the cafeteria for a midmorning sendoff of hot dogs, soft drinks and cake. Afterward, some workers drifted away to bars and diners for their goodbyes. 
 ''It's been a sad day because these people have done more than was expected of them, with all the adversity, knowing the plant was going to close,'' said Robert LaPoint, chairman of Local 980 of the United Auto Workers, which represented Edison's 750 production workers. ''They go out with their heads held proud.''
 The closing adds to the steady erosion of manufacturing in New Jersey that started nearly 35 years ago. 
 ''It's another part of the passing of an era for New Jersey and the rest of the region,'' said Joseph J. Seneca, a professor at Rutgers and chairman of the New Jersey Council of Economic Advisers, which provides economic analysis to the governor and the Legislature. Since 1969, New Jersey has lost about 540,000 manufacturing jobs, Professor Seneca said. At the end of 2003, he said, New Jersey had 355,100 manufacturing jobs, or 8.8 percent of total employment, down from a peak of 893,600 jobs, or 34.7 percent of all employment, in 1969.
 In part, he said, the Edison plant fell victim to ''intense worldwide competition'' in the auto industry and an excess of production plants and assembly lines.
 Ford's contract with the U.A.W. provided Edison's workers with three options: retirement, transfer or dismissal with three years' pay. About 300 workers are retiring and will receive various one-time payments, in addition to their regular pensions, a Ford spokesman, Octavio Navarro, said. Those payments include $35,000 for workers whose age and years of service total at least 85, Mr. LaPoint said. 
 At the moment, between 150 and 200 are considering relocating to another Ford plant at their regular salary, Mr. Navarro said. The others have opted for dismissal. Under the contract, these workers will receive their current salary through 2007 if they perform some type of community service each day, such as hospital volunteering, Mr. Navarro said.
 During the afternoon, several workers lingered at a picnic table behind the union office. Some drank beer, others brandy.
 Gregory O'Neal, 40, who has worked at the plant for five years, call the closing ''pleasant.'' He said: ''We must move on. Ford is a family. They're going to take care of their people until the end.'' He said he was opting for the termination plan with three years' pay.
 A pipe fitter, Kevin Lewis, 48, said he was bitter. He has three children, and the oldest is headed for college this fall. ''There are things I have to pay for this year,'' he said, ''and I'm not sure how I'm going to pay for them.''
 At Craig's Deli, the owner, Craig Mailler, said he expected to lose about 20 percent of his business. ''It's going to kill me,'' he said. But, he added, he will no longer have to open at 5 a.m. ''I used to do $150 in the first hour,'' he said. ''Now if I do $20, I'll be lucky.''
 Mr. Navarro said the Edison work force turned out quality Ranger and Mazda B-Series pickups and had earned high performance grades from the company. ''It was an economic issue at the end of the day,'' Mr. Navarro said of the reason for the plant's demise. In a major retrenchment plan announced in January 2002, Ford said the Edison plant would be shut by the middle of the decade, along with other plants in Ohio, Michigan, Missouri and Ontario, and that 35,000 workers over all would be terminated.
 Cutbacks in Edison started months ago. Since last year, about 600 jobs have been eliminated there, Mr. Navarro said. The Edison plant opened in 1948 in Ford's post-World War II expansion. Over the years, the company said, it produced nearly 6.9 millions vehicles, starting with Lincolns in its first decade, then Falcons, Comets and Mustangs in the 1960's, and Pintos, Bobcats, Escorts and Lynxes from 1972 to 1990. Then, production shifted to the pickups.
 The future of the site is now uncertain. A Ford spokeswoman, Angie Kozleski, said a dozen developers have submitted bids to buy the land. 
 Edison's mayor, George A. Spadoro, said he sympathized with Ford's workers and local merchants who will suffer financially. But he envisioned a combination of new retail, commercial and entertainment outlets on the site -- on a busy Route 1 commercial strip -- that will generate enough jobs to offset loss of the Ford workers.
 ''From the ashes of the closed plant will rise a wonderful mixed-use property,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Action Urged On Diseases With Dangers For Women

BYLINE: By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
New diagnostic tests and better information programs are urgently needed to improve the control of a number of infectious diseases that affect women and newborns, a top federal health official said here on Friday.
 Sexually transmitted diseases and certain other common infections affect women disproportionately, compared with men, and can be dangerous, particularly in pregnancy, said the official, Dr. Julie L. Gerberding. Dr. Gerberding is director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention here. 
 Cultural, economic and social factors also have a critical role in the disparities between men and women. Women often serve as the brokers for their families' health care ''but are last in line to address their own health problems for lack of time,'' Dr. Gerberding said at the opening of a two-day international meeting on women and infectious diseases.
 A lack of scientific knowledge and the failure to apply what is known also increases the burden of such illnesses on women, she said.
 The centers, the World Health Organization and the American Society for Microbiology are sponsoring the meeting to renew efforts to decrease infection death rates among women and newborns.
 ''Women disproportionately suffer the burden of poverty, are the victims of widespread and persistent discrimination in all areas of life and put their lives at risk every time they become pregnant,'' Dr. Gerberding said.
 She added that although the problem of women and infection was more complicated than gender alone, it offered ''some unique aspects.''
 One is that certain diseases can cause more serious illness and lead to more severe complications among pregnant women. Another is that women are at least four times more vulnerable to infection from H.I.V. and other sexually transmitted diseases.
 For example, 60 percent to 70 percent of the women who are infected with gonorrhea or chlamydia may be unaware of it. Delayed diagnosis and treatment can lead to chronic pain, stillbirth, infertility and even death.
 ''Nearly every sexually transmitted pathogen can also be passed on to the fetus or infant, sometimes with fatal consequences,'' Dr. Gerberding said.
 The most notorious example is H.I.V., the AIDS virus, which has created millions of orphans in Africa.
 Dr. Paul DeLay, an official of United Nations AIDS, said information from 2002, the latest available, showed that women accounted for 58 percent of H.I.V. infections in sub-Saharan Africa.
 New H.I.V. infections are also increasing among women in the United States. In 2001 in New York City, 35 percent of new H.I.V. diagnoses were in women, compared with 28 percent before 2001.
 In Africa, H.I.V. infection rates among teenage girls are 5 to 16 times higher than among teenage boys, and women in their early 20's are infected at three times the rate of male teenagers.
 Hepatitis E, a viral liver disease, is another potentially fatal infection, particularly in the third trimester of pregnancy. Hepatitis E can cause miscarriages, stillbirths and serious illness among newborns. The infection is spread through fecal contamination of water. There is no vaccination to prevent hepatitis E and no specific therapy after it develops.
 Though hepatitis E is considered rare in the United States, some studies suggest that the virus has infected 5 percent of Americans. Hepatitis E is common in Mexico and some African and Asian nations, and many countries have had large outbreaks.
 Dr. Gerberding pointed to successes in reducing illness and deaths from two common infections among women. 
 She said immunization against the hepatitis B virus at birth prevented one death for every 15 infants born to mothers infected with the virus.
 Participants at the meeting said routine testing of pregnant women for streptococcal B bacteria prevented an estimated 4,500 cases last year in the United States. But the participants said further prevention efforts were needed, because the infection remained a leading cause of maternal and newborn illness and death. There were 1,570 cases and 110 deaths from group B streptococci in 2002.
 Last fall, scientists reported the discovery in Tanzania of a new species of a spiral-shape bacteria that can be spread by household ticks and that causes relapsing fever. The disease is common in Tanzania, where it causes serious illness among children and pregnant women.
 The world's two most common parasitic infections, malaria and schistosomiasis, also affect women disproportionately, Dr. Gerberding said.
 In pregnant women, malaria causes more severe complications like brain infection than in women who are not pregnant. Schistosomiasis is common among women who wash laundry in shallow water where the parasite thrives.

HEADLINE: Louisiana's Wetlands

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Having just returned from a trip to Iraq, I can attest to the critical needs of that country. The destruction of Iraq's wetlands is certainly worthy of the United States help you chronicled (front page, Feb. 21).
 Ironically, however, the Bush administration and the Republican-led Senate will not demand the same urgency of action to save coastal wetlands at home. Each year, Louisiana loses 25 to 35 square miles of coastal marsh, largely because of federal activities. And yet in their rewrite of the energy bill, Senate Republicans killed spending provisions addressing Louisiana's coastal loss, while our residents have done just the opposite -- dedicating state dollars to a federal-state restoration effort.
 Congress has begun restoring the Chesapeake Bay and the Florida Everglades, and now we're restoring Iraq's wetlands. National leaders should address an environmental and economic crisis more significant than any of these: the loss of ''America's Wetland'' in coastal Louisiana.

HEADLINE: Cut Benefits to Save the Tax Cuts?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Re ''Mr. Greenspan's Warning'' (editorial, Feb. 27):
 How can you expect anyone to take you seriously when you say, ''Now the tax cuts have left the federal government practically helpless''? As if this is the only fiscal difficulty the nation has faced over the last three years.
 Have there been no positive effects from the tax cuts? Are there no lingering negative effects of the 2000-2 recession? What about the cost of the war on terror? The polemic is so obvious that a reader who disagrees even moderately is stimulated to ignore the rest of the argument as well.

To the Editor:
 Re ''The Americano Dream,'' by David Brooks (column, Feb. 24):
 While indeed many immigrants are ''strivers'' and enrich our country with ''new energy,'' neither energy nor ambition is likely to result in immigrants' realizing the American dream of socioeconomic success if they are unable to find jobs. 
 The Hispanic unemployment rate is currently 7.3 percent, compared with 5.6 percent for all workers, and recent job gains among Hispanics have accrued disproportionately to very recent immigrants rather than to long-term residents.
 Many of my relatives, who immigrated to the United States from Sweden, faced hardship during their first years in the United States because of unemployment, despite their motivation and eagerness. Should we not try to tackle immigrant unemployment before importing even more people seeking work?

HEADLINE: Diplomats See Modest Progress In North Korea Nuclear Talks

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: BEIJING, Saturday, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
The United States, North Korea and four other nations were due to issue a statement Saturday pledging to work for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula, but they left almost all major disputes about the North's nuclear program unresolved, officials and news reports said.
 In a joint statement that China, the host of the six-nation talks, was scrambling to finalize Saturday afternoon, the participants also agreed to meet again by June and to establish working groups that would tackle some of the most contentious issues about nuclear disarmament before then, according to Bush administration officials.
 But a closing ceremony was delayed by at least an hour following indications that North Korea objected to some of the wording in the final communique at the last minute, raising questions about whether the parties would have anything to show for their four days of talks.
 The statement, if issued as drafted, would be the first written commitment by the United States and North Korea to resolve the crisis that broke out 16 months ago, shortly after the Bush administration accused the North of breaking an earlier accord. It represents the fruits of intensive diplomacy by China, which had been pushing the parties to declare a common goal despite some stark differences in their negotiating positions. 
 Still, after three such sessions of talks between the United States and North Korea -- and two that also included China, Russia, South Korea and Japan -- the parties have only begun to debate detailed terms for ending the North's nuclear program.
 While diplomats are likely to hail Saturday's agreement as at least a modest advance, it merely delays negotiations on the most delicate issues and potentially gives North Korea time to continue to develop nuclear weapons, experts say.
 A senior Bush administration official signaled that the United States intended to treat the latest talks as a step in the right direction, even though they ended without addressing the main American concerns. ''We think we have the basis for the kind of talks we need,'' the official.
 Although the joint statement did not use the words the United States had been insisting are its bottom line -- the complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement of North Korea nuclear program -- this official said it remained high on the agenda.
 ''It is understood by all that in the follow-up process we will take up complete, irreversible, verifiable denuclearization,'' the official said.
 Although the talks began Wednesday with hints of a new flexibility on all sides, the United States and North Korea remained far apart on several crucial questions, participants said. They included whether North Korea is using enriched uranium as well as plutonium for bomb fuel, whether it must discontinue both military and civilian nuclear programs, and whether it must agree to dismantle completely its nuclear program before receiving aid. 
 Over all, the talks were described as more substantive than previous rounds. North Korea put forward a plan to freeze its weapons program in return for economic benefits. South Korea offered to provide energy aid to its northern neighbor after a nuclear freeze. provided that the freeze was a first step toward full elimination of the nuclear program.
 Diplomats said all parties had greeted North Korea's offer to stop its nuclear program as a positive development. China and Russia offered to join South Korea in providing energy aid if North Korea froze its weapons program, though the United States and Japan said they would not offer aid at that stage.
 But the discussions bogged down when North Korea made a new distinction between its civilian and military nuclear programs, and insisted that it would continue to develop nuclear technology for peaceful purposes, like generating electricity. Experts say the country does not now have a civilian nuclear program to produce electricity.
 North Korea has also continued to deny that it has made efforts to produce fissile material for nuclear bombs by uranium enrichment in addition to its larger and better known facility for extracting plutonium from spent nuclear fuel rods.
 The United States says it has solid intelligence that North Korea pursued this second channel for developing atomic weapons, a claim that was bolstered by the recent confession by a Pakistani nuclear scientist who said he had provided such technology to North Korea.
 Bush administration officials took a tough stance in the talks, demanding that any statement of common goals include a reference to the ''complete, verifiable, irreversible dismantlement'' of all nuclear programs undertaken by the North.

Securities Fraud Charge Thrown Out in Stewart Case
Dealing a setback to prosecutors in the Martha Stewart case, the judge overseeing the trial threw out the charge of securities fraud, the most serious one against her. Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum of Federal District Court in Manhattan wrote in a 23-page opinion that ''a reasonable juror could not, without resorting to speculation and surmise, find beyond a reasonable doubt'' that Ms. Stewart was guilty of the charge.
 Closing arguments in the case are expected to begin Monday, with the final version of the instructions to be read to jurors on Wednesday. [Page A1.]

HEADLINE: Feuding Over Intelligence (That's IQ, Not G-2)

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING

DATELINE: PARIS, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
It was an affair that could not last. One year after France's leftist intelligentsia and conservative government joined forces to oppose war in Iraq, the love fest has ended in fresh talk of war. Now some 40,000 members of the educated elite have signed a petition that accuses the government of waging ''war on intelligence'' -- brain power, that is, not spying.
 Underneath the polemics, as usual, lie money and politics. The protesters say that President Jacques Chirac's government has been trimming cultural, educational and scientific budgets to the detriment of the country's ''intelligence.'' While the government has a solid majority in parliament and the Socialist opposition is in disarray, the intellectuals are using next month's nationwide regional elections to get attention. 
 The squabble captured the spotlight at the awards ceremony for the Cesars, the French Oscars, last Saturday. The actress and director Agnes Jaoui (''The Taste of Others'') led a verbal attack on Culture Minister Jean-Jacques Aillagon, accusing him of sponsoring ''absurd laws to eliminate the cultural exception.'' ''Cultural exception'' is used here to describe government support for French culture and protection of it.
 Mr. Aillagon sat through the bombardment in uncomfortable silence, but he responded a few days later in a front-page article in Le Monde. ''What overwhelming conceit, this pretension to claim a monopoly over the defense of intelligence,'' he wrote of the petition's signers. And he added, ''The worst thing that intellectuals in this country can do is to enclose themselves in an immobilism and protectionism that will end up swallowing them.''
 Patrick Devedjian, a junior government minister, was even more outspoken. ''In this country the intellectuals have a habit of signing petitions while in the United States they have Nobel Prizes,'' he told a radio station. ''Being an intellectual should not be considered a protected species. Being an intellectual includes demands, and results are often expected.''
 Mr. Devedjian's remarks were considered inflammatory enough to merit opposition protests in Parliament, not least because many Socialist and Communist deputies, including a former Socialist prime minister, Michel Rocard, were among the petition's supporters.
 The feud is rooted in a protest movement that sabotaged scores of arts festivals here last summer and then bubbled on through the winter, with the government refusing to restore cuts in unemployment benefits for self-employed actors and technicians. Now that dispute has become the spearhead of a much broader movement embracing teachers, scientists, psychiatrists, archaeologists, doctors, even lawyers.
 All that they have in common, it seems, is a gripe against the government, usually over budget cuts, in some cases over recent law reforms: lawyers argue that increased police powers threaten human rights; psychotherapists are unhappy over a new bill requiring them to be formally qualified; archaeologists say the government has weakened their authority to supervise construction projects; and scientists complain that 550 postgraduate research jobs have been cut.
 Thanks to the appeal against war on intelligence, made last week by Les Inrockuptibles, a rock and general-interest magazine modeled after Rolling Stone, these diverse sectors closed ranks. Thus the petition's signers include not only familiar faces like the philosopher Jacques Derrida, the movie directors Bertrand Tavernier and Claude Lanzmann, the theater directors Patrice Chereau and Ariane Mnouchkine and the former culture minister, Jack Lang, but also thousands of unknown intellectuals and professionals.
 ''All these sectors of learning, research, thought, social ties, producers of knowledge and public debate are today the target of massive attacks, evidence of a new government anti-intellectualism,'' said the petition, which was widely circulated by e-mail.
 In the middle of this week, Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin stepped in to soothe tempers, saying he would have increased cultural subsidies if he had inherited a stronger economy from the Socialists two years ago. But he promised to work for solutions, then added a postscript: ''In your commentaries about Mr. Aillagon's presence at the Cesars ceremony, you omitted one word: courage.''
 Where this will lead is unclear, although the regional elections here on March 21 and 28 should help define the relative strengths of government and opposition. After that, if the past is any guide, the government and its vocal new foes will probably sit down and negotiate a truce. Despite the harsh words, they will continue to need each other.

HEADLINE: Overpromising on Trade

 BODY:
It's not surprising that the Democratic primary has produced a ton of pandering on the issue of trade. About 2.3 million jobs have been lost during the Bush years, and many -- the exact number is unclear -- have migrated abroad. Several candidates were thus quick to claim magical powers to stanch the tide, doing a disservice to themselves and the workers they wanted to champion. 
 Lately the debate has become more nuanced. The serious candidates left standing, John Kerry and John Edwards, have begun to show a more sophisticated appreciation of the difficulties of controlling global market forces. Even so, there remains plenty of room for more plain speaking on the issue. Mr. Kerry and Mr. Edwards are both basically pro-trade, but neither seems eager to acknowledge it. They sensibly call for more tightly drawn agreements that lift wages for foreign workers and improve working conditions. But they tend to give their audiences the misleading impression that such improvements would stop large numbers of jobs from going overseas. And while they clamor for a more level playing field, neither calls attention to the way in which America's elaborate system of farm subsidies hurts poor farmers abroad while mocking the very idea of fair trade.
 Their favorite target is the North American Free Trade Agreement, one of the Clinton administration's triumphs. Mr. Edwards says he would have voted against it, had he been in the Senate at the time. Mr. Kerry defends his pro-Nafta vote but says the treaty needs ''review.'' One important issue for both men involves the original accord's side agreements, which govern environmental standards and labor laws. These have not been rigorously applied, lowering manufacturing costs abroad while hurting foreign workers. Mr. Edwards wants tougher agreements embedded in a reworked treaty. Mr. Kerry wants stronger enforcement.
 The larger point they make is important. If workers elsewhere cannot bargain for better wages, it will be much harder to achieve two important benefits of free trade: a growing middle class and a growing market for American products abroad. The side agreements Mr. Kerry and Mr. Edward talk about should help. But foreign workers would still make far less than Americans, and manufacturing jobs would still keep moving abroad.
 In recent discussions with editors at The New York Times, both men said it was important not to promise too much. Mr. Edwards conceded that his reforms are ''not going to save all those jobs.'' Mr. Kerry said he hoped only to slow the ''outsourcing'' of jobs.
 Such newfound modesty in the face of economic reality is welcome. One wishes that it applied to the campaign trail, where Mr. Edwards continues to flail Mr. Kerry for his pro-Nafta vote, and where Mr. Kerry thunders that ''the heart has been ripped out of the heartland.'' Some verbal downsizing is required, lest one or the other senator -- should he make it all the way to the White House -- find himself having to explain why he can't put the genie back in the bottle.

HEADLINE: Budget Office Predicts Deficit Over 10 Years: $2.75 Trillion

BYLINE: By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
President Bush's new tax and spending plan would produce deficits of $2.75 trillion over the next 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office reported Friday in the first detailed analysis of the White House budget.
 If there were no changes in taxes and if spending increased only at the rate of inflation, the deficit would be about $2 trillion over the next 10 years, the budget office reported today. But the new estimate is $737 billion higher, primarily reflecting Mr. Bush's desire to make permanent the tax cuts due to expire by 2011. 
 Three years ago, the budget office forecast budget surpluses totaling $5.6 trillion for the 10-year period ending in 2011.
 The budget office predicts that this year's deficit will be $478 billion, lower than Mr. Bush's estimate of $521 billion, and it estimates that the deficit will be cut almost in half in three years, to $242 billion.
 The forecasts by the budget office, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, indicate, however, that deficits will begin rising again toward the end of the next 10-year period, after the Bush tax cuts take full effect. And like the administration's budget, the budget office excludes some large expenses like the cost of operations in Iraq.
 The most revealing part of the office's projection is the outlook from 2010 to 2014. 
 Deficits would total almost $1.4 trillion over that period, and the annual deficit will be $289 billion, and growing larger, as the nation heads into a wave of soaring costs from Social Security and Medicare payouts as more baby boomers reach retirement age.
 Republicans argue that 10-year projections are flawed and unreliable and that the tax cuts were needed to get the economy going in the short-term while encouraging job growth and new business investment in later years.
 Democrats contend that the White House wants to use five-year numbers to hide the huge and continuing deficits in later years. They argue that the tax cuts will squander resources needed to address a multitude of problems facing the country, including domestic security and more Social Security claims.
 ''As bad as these numbers are, they are actually worse because they omit significant costs that the president has omitted from his budget,'' said Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the ranking Democrat on the House Budget Committee.
 In addition to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, which could cost $50 billion next year, the budget does not include a provision for fixing the alternative minimum tax, a change that will probably drain $600 billion from the budget over the next decade, Mr. Spratt said.
 By making only five-year projections, he said, the Bush plan ''left most people thinking we will cut the deficit in half and it will keep on declining. But in truth, we see in the C.B.O. projections that the deficit gets worse over the long term. We simply don't have a plan to eradicate it.''
 Chad Kolton, spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget at the White House, said that administration officials are pleased that the budget office endorsed White House forecasts of a halved deficit within five years. But Mr. Kolton dismissed concerns about the large deficits predicted for later years.
 ''Once you get beyond that five-year window, the numbers, even by the C.B.O.'s account, become notoriously inaccurate,'' Mr. Kolton said. ''Even C.B.O. would admit we don't honestly know what these numbers will look like 10 years from now.''
 Brian Riedl, federal budget analyst at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative research group in Washington, said the 10-year projections ''should be taken with a grain of salt because a 1 percent change in economic growth this year could alter annual tax revenues by hundreds of billions of dollars over the next decade.''
 More important, Mr. Riedl said, were Congressional Budget Office forecasts indicating that total tax revenues will grow by almost 30 percent over the next three years because of the economic rebound and stock-market profits that will bolster capital-gains taxes. ''I was pleasantly surprised that revenues were projected as high as they were,'' he said.
 Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee, said it was ''fantasy'' to say the deficit would fall by half in just a few years because those budgets included hundreds of billions of dollars in surpluses from Social Security that would have to be repaid at some point.
 ''Instead of cutting the deficit in half,'' Mr. Conrad said in a statement on Friday night, ''the president's policies will lead to an explosion of debt, with gross federal debt reaching almost $13.9 trillion'' by 2014.

HEADLINE: Bush and Schroder Laugh Over Lunch, but Not All Weekend

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
President Bush and Chancellor Gerhard Schroder of Germany agreed Friday to put behind them their bitter rift over Iraq and pledged to work together to fight terrorism and bring democracy and stability to the Middle East.
 They seemed to mean it.
 ''We have had differences in the past,'' Mr. Bush said with Mr. Schroder at his side in the Oval Office. ''But there's nothing wrong with friends having differences. And we have both committed to put the differences behind us and move forward.'' 
 Mr. Schroder, who not only opposed the war but ran for re-election in 2002 on a platform that some White House officials considered to be anti-Bush, if not anti-American, said he and the president had agreed to talk ''not about the past'' but about what comes next.
 ''We both have an interest in seeing a stable and democratic Iraq develop,'' Mr. Schroder said. 
 The visit was the German leader's first to the White House since the war, and he seemed to succeed in forging a personal connection with Mr. Bush, or at least to temper his reputation among some administration officials as a dour Old European.
 ''The chancellor has got a good sense of humor, and therefore, he is able to make me laugh,'' said Mr. Bush, whose aides were unable or unwilling to recount any of Mr. Schroder's jokes. ''And a person that can make me laugh is a person who's easy to be with.''
 Mr. Bush and Mr. Schroder covered a range of issues during their Oval Office meeting and a subsequent lunch. In addition to discussing Iraq and the Middle East, aides said, they talked about Turkey, with Mr. Schroder assuring the president that Germany would support negotiations for Turkey to become a member of the European Union.
 Aides said they also discussed the weakening dollar, a subject of mounting concern in Europe, especially in Germany, whose export-driven economy is being hit hard by the weak dollar. Mr. Bush, said Scott McClellan, the White House spokesman, reiterated American policy that a strong dollar was good for the United States. 
 After their meeting, the leaders issued a joint statement. Its centerpiece was ''an ambitious goal, rooted in our shared values and experience: to promote freedom, democracy, human dignity, the rule of law, economic opportunity and security in the Greater Middle East.''
 Mr. Schroder has voiced support for the administration's attempt to bring its allies together to transform the Middle East, although other European nations, particularly France, have expressed reservations about associating their own efforts in the area with those of the United States.
 Meanwhile, the administration said Under Secretary of State Marc Grossman would go to Europe and the Middle East next week to quell criticism that the United States was preparing its so-called Greater Middle East Initiative without consulting the countries to be affected. 
 One topic that did not come up in the talks between Mr. Bush and Mr. Schroder, Mr. McClellan said, was whether the United States would drop its ban on allowing German companies to bid on prime contracts for rebuilding Iraq. 
 The administration has limited the bidding to countries that supported the United States in the war, though it has made an exception for Canada.
 In recent months, however, Germany has signed on to an American effort to win agreement among Iraq's creditors to forgive much of the international debt run up by Saddam Hussein's government. The administration has suggested that Germany's cooperation can eventually lead the White House to rethink its decision about barring nations that opposed the war from making contract bids on Iraq's reconstruction.
 But if Mr. Schroder had any illusion that he had been welcomed into Mr. Bush's inner circle of favored foreign leaders, it might have been shattered had he hung around a little longer. Then he might have seen Mr. Bush's helicopter fly the president away for a weekend at Camp David, the retreat to which Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and other leaders from abroad have been invited in the past few years as a reward for steadfast support.

HEADLINE: 2 Killed as Troops Fight Protesters in Venezuela

BYLINE: By JUAN FORERO

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
Venezuelan troops and antigovernment demonstrators clashed Friday in the streets of the capital, Caracas, leaving at least two people dead and several wounded as President Hugo Chavez convened a summit meeting of developing nations.
 The confrontation, in which National Guard troops repeatedly fired tear gas at protesters and gunfire broke out, came two days before a government electoral board was to rule on the validity of signatures government opponents had collected to force a referendum on recalling Mr. Chavez from office. 
 Earlier this week, the Venezuelan electoral authorities said up to a third of the 3.4 million signatures submitted would require further revisions and be checked for fraud because of technical violations, leading to an outcry from the petition's organizers. A Western diplomat familiar with the electoral process said the National Electoral Council would announce Sunday a five-day ''repair period'' in which those who signed could verify their signatures.
 Since a brief uprising in 2002 and a series of strikes failed to oust Mr. Chavez, the opposition has resorted to a binding recall referendum as allowed in the Constitution. The opposition needs 2.4 million signatures, but many political analysts warn that if the government succeeds in blocking a vote, Venezuela could become gripped in violence.
 Opponents of Mr. Chavez say the government and the electoral board have increasingly put up obstacles to derail their referendum efforts. Though he was democratically elected, many Venezuelans accuse him of authoritarian rule and mismanaging the economy. The government accuses the opposition of provoking violence. 
 ''Tensions are high, and it's an important moment for the country,'' the diplomat said in a telephone interview from Caracas.
 The Bush administration, which has been increasingly critical of Mr. Chavez and supportive of the opposition, called on his government on Friday to respect the rights of the people. ''The Venezuelan government has, at times, agreed with those rights, but often we've seen activity that we think is not consistent with that,'' said Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman.
 The Organization of American States and the Atlanta-based Carter Center, mediators in Venezuela, are working with electoral officials to streamline the signature verification process and ensure that the repair period is technically feasible.
 The Caracas fire chief, Rodolfo Bricero, said 2 people had been killed and 14 wounded by gunfire, and 10 more hurt by plastic bullets, Reuters reported.
 The government halted live broadcasts of the unrest, replacing them with speeches from the summit meeting, which was attended by leaders from 19 Latin American, Asian and African nations.

HEADLINE: Growth for 4th Quarter Revised Upward a Bit

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The economy grew a bit more quickly than first thought at the end of last year as business investment jumped, official figures showed yesterday, in an encouraging sign for further solid growth.
 A separate reading on Chicago-area business activity also provided a rare ray of hope on the employment front with a big jump in jobs, despite an overall decline in business activity.
 The gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the nation's economic health, was revised upward to a 4.1 percent annual growth rate for the fourth quarter, just above the initial reading last month of 4 percent, the Commerce Department said. 
 ''Over all, the signals on growth are pretty positive,'' said Jim O'Sullivan, senior economist at UBS. ''It's very clear that business investment has rebounded, but there are still questions about what's happening in the labor market.'' 
 He said the economy was most likely stronger in the current quarter, with growth probably around 5 percent, which bodes well for an eventual rise in hiring.
 The fourth-quarter gross domestic product reading was nudged higher because business spending on equipment and software was more robust than first thought and companies added to inventories at a faster pace.
 ''The unexpected good news in these data is the big upward revision to capital spending on equipment and software, now estimated at 15.1 percent, up from the advance 10 percent,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics.
 The jump in business investment reinforced expectations that capital spending would lead the economy higher this year even as consumer spending eases from last year's tax-cut-fueled surge. In the fourth quarter, consumers curbed their spending on expensive durable goods, which fell 0.1 percent.
 In the fourth quarter, imports jumped at a 16.4 percent annual pace, up from an initially reported 11.3 percent rate, another reflection of solid demand. It was the strongest reading on imports since the second quarter of 2002.
 Helped by a weaker dollar, exports also turned in a strong performance, rising at a revised 21 percent rate, a couple of notches above last month's estimate and the biggest jump in seven years.
 In addition, a closely watched survey of activity in the Midwest reported good news despite a slight fall in the overall index of the National Association of Purchasing Management-Chicago to 63.6 in February from 65.9.
 The all-important jobs component surged unexpectedly to the best level since April 1998, rising to 54.8 from 48.3.
 Another regional report also showed that spring arrived early for New York City's economy, as a rebounding Wall Street and slowing job losses in February helped businesses enjoy the sixth consecutive month of expansion.
 Still, consumer confidence nationwide has been hit by the weak jobs market, as a reading on sentiment from the University of Michigan yesterday slipped to 94.4 in February from 103.8.

HEADLINE: Nearly Half Of Black Men Found Jobless

BYLINE: By JANNY SCOTT

 BODY:
It is well known that the unemployment rate in New York City rose sharply during the recent recession. It is also understood that the increase was worse for men than for women, and especially bad for black men. But a new study examining trends in joblessness in the city since 2000 suggests that by 2003, nearly one of every two black men between 16 and 64 was not working.
 The study, by the Community Service Society, a nonprofit group that serves the poor, is based on data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics and focuses on the so-called employment-population ratio -- the fraction of the working-age population with a paid job -- in addition to the more familiar unemployment rate, the percentage of the labor force actively looking for work. 
 Mark Levitan, the report's author, found that just 51.8 percent of black men ages 16 to 64 held jobs in New York City in 2003. The rate for white men was 75.7 percent; for Hispanic men, 65.7; and for black women, 57.1. The employment-population ratio for black men was the lowest for the period Mr. Levitan has studied, which goes back to 1979. 
 ''We're left with a very big question,'' Mr. Levitan, a senior policy analyst with the society, said in an interview. ''As the economy recovers, will we see a rise in employment among black men in tandem with the rise in employment of city residents generally? In other words, is this fundamentally a cyclical problem or is it more deeply structural? I fear that it is more deeply structural.''
 Researchers who have studied joblessness said Mr. Levitan's findings were consistent with trends among disadvantaged men, both black and white, in other Northern and Midwestern cities where manufacturing jobs have disappeared in recent decades. Some said factors that might have made the problem worse since 2000 could include welfare reform, high rates of incarceration producing gaps in job histories, and competition with immigrants for low-skill jobs.
 Lawrence M. Mead, a professor of political science at New York University who specializes in social policy and welfare reform, said that labor force participation -- job-holding and job-seeking -- among disadvantaged men had been declining nationwide and that New York City had long had ''a lower work level'' than elsewhere. Others said a similar racial gap in male employment had been seen in Midwestern and Central states.
 ''You're really talking about a long-term problem among low-skilled, disadvantaged men,'' Professor Mead said. ''Blacks are disproportionately disadvantaged. You're seeing this tendency to drop out. It's very serious and nobody has an answer.''
 Mindy Tarlow, executive director of the Center for Employment Opportunities, an employment program for men and women with criminal records that is based in Lower Manhattan, said her agency's success rate in placing clients in unsubsidized jobs had dropped to 55 percent from 65 percent between 2000 and 2003. She attributed the change not only to the recession but also to women coming off welfare and looking for work.
 ''I do know there are more people in the low-skill job market competing for the same low-skill jobs,'' she said. ''In some ways, the low-skill job market has become more competitive. Welfare reform came into law in 1996, but I think the impact was starting to be felt around 2000, maybe earlier.''
 David R. Howell, a labor economist and professor at New School University, said service jobs were particularly hard for black men to get. He said studies had shown that employers ''are particularly uninterested in hiring black men for jobs that require customer or client contact, for whatever reason.'' They tend to give preference to women, he said.
 Mr. Levitan used data from the Current Population Survey, a monthly survey done by the Bureau of Labor Statistics on a nationwide basis. He averaged the 12 monthly figures for New York City for each year. He said he used the employment-population ratio because the unemployment rate, which counts only people who are actively looking for a job, did not capture those too discouraged to keep trying.
 In a recession, the number of discouraged workers goes up, Mr. Levitan said. If job losses land disproportionately on one group of people, a disproportionate share of that group may give up looking for work. In that case, changes in the unemployment rate for that group will tend to understate the relative impact of the recession on that group, he said.
 Mr. Levitan found that the unemployment rate for black men in New York City rose by 5.3 percentage points, to 12.9 percent, in 2003. The employment-population ratio dropped by 12.2 percentage points, to 51.8, from a cycle peak of 64 in 2000. The employment-population ratio for Hispanic men dropped by 7.1 percentage points; the ratio for white men dropped by 2.1. The margin of error was 4 percent.
 The declines among black and Hispanic women were smaller than among black and Hispanic men. Mr. Levitan said the industries that had the biggest drop in employment -- manufacturing, finance and professional services -- were dominated by men. And the one sector that grew significantly during the recession -- education and health services, which now accounts for 18.7 percent of all jobs -- is overwhelmingly female.
 ''It definitely reflects that black men disproportionately have had to carry the burden of the unemployment situation in New York City,'' Lizzette Hill Barcelona, executive director of Strive New York, a work force development agency, said of Mr. Levitan's findings. ''Black men are usually the least skilled. In a tough economy, those are the jobs that you can do away with.''
 Andrew A. Beveridge, a sociologist at Queens College, questioned whether the data from the Current Population Survey, which is done nationally, could reliably be used to track changes in joblessness among specific groups in New York City from one year to the next. He said it was conceivable a year-to-year change might be the result of changes in the sample of people surveyed. 
 Mr. Levitan said the Bureau of Labor Statistics had used a methodology similar to his, using its 12 monthly surveys to create annual averages for states, metropolitan areas and cities. He said the sample size in New York City was big enough to be reliable. And he said the data from 1979 to 2003 followed a pattern consistent with the business cycle, suggesting that they accurately reflected reality.
 Professor Howell, who had seen the study, said: ''The magnitude of the employment-rate collapse is so large for black males that it looks like a data problem. But I don't think it is. Because you see not as startling a drop, but still a very large drop, for Hispanic males as well. It's well known that black men are at the end of the hiring queue. So it's perfectly plausible that they took the biggest hit.''

HEADLINE: State Farm Swung to Annual Profit in 2003

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BLOOMINGTON, Ill., Feb. 27 

 BODY:
Higher premiums and lower claims helped State Farm Insurance earn a $2.8 billion profit in 2003, reversing two consecutive years of multibillion-dollar losses, the company said on Friday.
 Analysts said the turnaround mirrored a trend in the industry, which has raised premiums to compensate for investment income that sagged in 2001 and 2002 because of a stock market downturn and low interest rates. 
 State Farm reported that 2003 revenue from premiums rose 10 percent, to $48.9 billion from $44.4 billion, after the company increased auto policy rates by 5 percent last year and homeowners' insurance by nearly 10 percent.
 Overall claims also dipped in 2003, despite above-average payouts for natural disasters that included last year's wildfires in Southern California, said Dick Luedke, a spokesman for the company.
 The company, based in Bloomington, continued streamlining efforts last year and now serves 3.5 percent more accounts than it did two and a half years ago using 10 percent fewer employees, Mr. Luedke said.

HEADLINE: For Liquor Store Owners, a Profitable Sunday Swap

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
Nine months later, never on Sunday has become sometimes on Sunday.
 Michael Inabinet set up the sidewalk sign with the smiling, yawning grapes on it outside Pet Wines on the Upper East Side just before noon last Sunday and awaited the stampede of the thirsty masses. ''We usually get a run on Champagne for mimosas,'' he said.
 A few minutes later in East Harlem at Rivera's Wine and Liquors on First Avenue, the customers were already out in force. Warnell Armstead, a manager at the Copacabana, gripped a big blue bottle of Skyy vodka and was going to walk the two blocks home to watch the Knicks. ''I don't have to go to New Jersey anymore,'' he said with a smile. 
 Over on the West Side, at Roma Discount Wine and Liquors on Amsterdam Avenue, Denise Yantin and her friend Wendy Greenfield were stocking up on vodka and triple sec, the active ingredients in cosmopolitans, for the evening's ''Sex and the City'' finale party. 
 Since May, liquor stores in New York have been allowed by state law to stay open on Sundays as long as they close one other day. And while only 15 percent of stores in New York City have taken up the offer, those that have say that business is good to great.
 ''Fantastic,'' said Henry Kim, Roma's president and Sunday cashier. ''More sales than Tuesday,'' when he is now closed; ''half as many hours.'' 
 ''Twice as good as Tuesday,'' said Mek Motyka, co-owner of Stare Miasto Liquor Store in Ridgewood, Queens, as he took a bottle of chilled vodka out the refrigerator and slid it across the counter to a taciturn man with a florid nose.
 In this world of instantaneous commercial access, banning the sale of certain products during certain hours seems quaint, if potentially annoying. But such is the legacy of New York's blue laws. The only publicly accessible place a person can legally obtain alcohol before noon on a Sunday is still a church. The recent state law, enacted last May, was a compromise proposed by the liquor lobby, which was promoting seven-day-a-week sales as a way to increase tax revenue.
 Even the partial loosening of the law, and the limited participation by stores, has been good for state coffers, according to tax figures compiled by the Distilled Spirits Council of the United States, a lobbying group. 
 From June to October 2003, New York state excise-tax revenue from wine and hard liquor sales rose by $4.2 million, or 7.1 percent, compared with the same period in 2002, the council says. While economic recovery may have spurred some of the increase, the council notes that excise taxes from beer, which is sold seven days a week, fell by 2.2 percent in the same period.
 But the semi-deregulation has also spawned a patchwork system rife with information gaps and other market inefficiencies. A Sunday spent store-hopping in three boroughs turned up plenty of people traveling farther than they needed to buy liquor because they did not know about stores near home that were open. Many other customers seemed to be just discovering, by accident, that Sunday sales were now legal. (A list of liquor stores open on Sunday in New York City can be found at nytimes.com/metro.) 
 In parts of the city where Sunday is not the prevailing day of rest, the decision to open on Sundays was relatively easy. ''I've always been closed on Saturday because I'm Jewish,'' said Cheryl Shalom, owner of Chateau Shalom on the fringe of the Orthodox Jewish enclave of Midwood, Brooklyn. ''So I'm gaining a sixth day.'' There are 14 stores in Jewish neighborhoods in Brooklyn that are closed Saturday and open Sunday.
 Elsewhere, though, the calculus is tricky. ''I tried closing on Tuesdays for about two weeks,'' said Manuel Corea, the owner of Allman Fine Wine and Liquors in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. ''It wasn't bad. I just don't have a lot of foot traffic on my block on Sundays, and it wasn't worth the fact that many of my customers were complaining on Wednesdays that I was closed the day before.''
 The gates were also shuttered at Columbus Wine and Spirits, a block away from Roma's on the Upper West Side. The co-owner, Harry Gordon, said while he thought he could do a reasonable Sunday trade, ''to close on one of the other days, in terms of deliveries and in terms of just running a business, would present problems.''
 ''I also think the people who work for us deserve to have a day off when everybody else is off,'' he added. ''They should get to be with their families.''
 Not surprisingly, many of the 150 stores in the city now open Sundays are in places where weekend shopping options abound. 
 At Uva Wines, in the hip mini-mall on Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg, Brian Knott, an employee, said that Sunday had become the second-busiest day, after Saturday. ''People seem to have a lot more time than during the week, so they do a lot more shopping,'' he said. ''On Sundays we do a lot more hand sales,'' the term for when a salesman walks the customer through the selection process. 
 At the new Whole Foods Market on Columbus Circle, a modest bacchanal was underway (this was Sunday, after all). ''I'm Lane Tanner and this is my Syrah,'' said the proprietor of Lane Tanner Winery in Santa Maria, Calif., as she handed plastic cups of it to anyone within reach. 
 ''You can't pour wine in a shop like this in California,'' Ms. Tanner said, ''so this is really unique for me.'' She signed a bottle for a customer, ''To Fouad and Dina, for your friendship.''
 Sunday liquor sales have had another positive effect: they have cut crime, or at least one particular crime.
 ''Sure beats the bootleggers,'' Rene Martinez said in front of Rivera Wine and Liquors as he cracked the seal on a $3.75 pint of Barton vodka. Mr. Martinez, 46, a retired seaman and self-described alcoholic, explained that bootleggers charged $5 for the same flask.
 His drinking buddy, Nathaniel Gibbs, said that as long as there had been Sunday bans on liquor sales, there had been entrepreneurs who made strong drink available, at a premium. ''You're standing less than 27 feet from one,'' he said.
 While Sunday sales have probably hurt the bootlegging industry, it is less clear whether they have also cut into the business of legitimate bars and of liquor stores in New Jersey, which have long been open Sundays. It did not immediately seem so. The New Jersey treasury department said it had not noticed any drop in liquor excise tax proceeds, and the liquor manager at the Food Emporium in Fort Lee, near the George Washington Bridge, said that his Sunday business was steady.
 Sunday night on Fifth Avenue in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, across the street from Oceana Liquors, which was locking up after its busiest day of the week (big run on triple sec and vodka, the owners said), the Sunday manager at the Wicked Monk pub, Maria Mangiameli, said she had not seen any drop-off either.
 ''People come here because they want to come to the bar or hear the music, not because they want to get bombed,'' she said.
 At the end of the bar, Deanna Gebhart sat before a glass of something beige and a steel thermos. The thermos held latte that she had brought from home. The glass held latte fortified by the bartender with a shot of Licor 43. 
 Ms. Gebhart, 48, a trainer for a bank, explained why there would always be a place for bars, even if liquor stores were open every day.
 ''If I had a bottle of that at home,'' she said, pointing at the Licor 43 on the shelf, ''I wouldn't have a bottle of it at home, if you know what I mean. I can't drink that till I come here. It's discipline. If I wanted to get drunk at home, I would just drink beer.''

HEADLINE: Iconoclast Gets Consultant Fees To Tell Big Oil It's Fading Fast

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

DATELINE: SNOWMASS, Colo. 

 BODY:
Today's oil industry reminds Amory B. Lovins of the whaling industry of the 19th century. 
 ''When oil was discovered, the whalers ran out of markets before they ran out of whales,'' Mr. Lovins said. These days, opportunities to improve energy efficiency and meet increased needs profitably with other sources, he argues, are accumulating so rapidly that demand for oil is likely to tumble more rapidly than the industry has projected. 
 ''When you add up all the alternatives,'' Mr. Lovins said, ''the game is moving away from oil much faster than people think.'' 
 Who would pay Mr. Lovins, 57, for such unconventional opinions in an era when a former oilman is in the White House, the government routinely opposes proposals to raise mileage requirements or other energy standards and many industry officials fret about whether Saudi Arabia can pump enough oil to avoid global shortages. 
 Try Shell Oil, which has turned to Mr. Lovins to help figure out how the oil industry can profit from leading the transition away from today's main uses of its core product. Major companies like Shell, Coca-Cola and Texas Instruments do not always agree with Mr. Lovins, but they value his iconoclastic views enough to pay the Rocky Mountain Institute, the nonprofit consulting and research group he leads, up to $20,000 a day for his consulting services. 
 Mr. Lovins is hoping his scrutiny of the oil industry, which will be published as a book this summer, could provide a jolt to debate about the world's energy future. By most accounts, he remains the best-known freethinker in the energy and environmental policy world and he routinely weighs in on important issues, like the role of hydrogen in the world's energy future. But it has been a while since any of his insights have made headlines.
 ''Hunter once remarked that I have a good idea every five years,'' Mr. Lovins said, referring to his former wife, L. Hunter Lovins. ''I'm due and there are several cooking.''
 In the Lovins lexicon, a ''good idea'' is not simply a technical suggestion that saves a client a lot of money. Such services have added to Mr. Lovins's credibility in the business world, but his real power comes from weaving together insights from many fields into a new perspective that can shake up how clients see their world and also how they manage energy and environmental challenges. 
 ''Amory is not a maverick,'' said Thomas Feiler, a former senior executive at the Rocky Mountain Institute. ''He's an enabler of mavericks.''
 Mr. Lovins, a balding slightly built man with a trace of middle-age paunch, pursues his grandiose goals without a hint of flamboyance. He is equally at home chatting about energy minutiae -- like the proper size for a motor controlling the pump he is viewing on a tour of a chemical plant -- as he is pontificating about the transformation of entire industries. 
 Sometimes he does more than talk and write about it. Hypercar, a venture started by the institute, is developing manufacturing machinery that Mr. Lovins hopes will hasten the replacement of steel in cars with lightweight carbon-fiber reinforced plastics.
 Mr. Lovins first gained notoriety in the mid-1970's for predicting that nuclear power was doomed because of the steadily rising cost of building new plants. He warned a disbelieving Wall Street and the utility industry that it would be financially reckless to invest in large new power plants of any sort because investments in energy efficiency, or ''negawatts,'' as he called them, would almost always be cheaper than new megawatts.
 His reputation was forged in an article in Foreign Affairs in 1976, when he argued for a soft path emphasizing energy efficiency over what he called the hard path based on expectations that the nation had no choice but to build thousands of large new power plants to meet its energy needs.
 ''It was the most influential thing I have ever read on energy,'' said Ralph Cavanagh, co-director of the energy program at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a leading environmental group.
 Long before other experts worried about such things, Mr. Lovins also described the nation's reliance on big power plants and a nationwide electric grid as a brittle power structure vulnerable to terrorism and extensive blackouts.
 Although harshly criticized at the time by the utility industry, his projections proved more prescient than the conventional ones. These days, energy industry executives who have never heard of Mr. Lovins are probably as rare as theologians who have never picked up a Bible. Mr. Lovins and the institute are also widely known in architecture and engineering circles as advocates of ''green design.''
 ''I view Amory as my older, much smarter brother,'' said Paul Westbrook, Texas Instruments' project manager for worldwide construction, who arranged for an institute team of 11 design and energy experts led by Mr. Lovins to conduct a three-day brainstorming session in December with engineers and executives responsible for planning a chip factory and office near the company's Dallas headquarters. 
 Among the conclusions that violated what currently passes for common sense in Texas was the proposal that a new office building, if properly designed, might not need air-conditioning -- only ceiling fans. 
 ''He's not preachy,'' Mr. Westbrook said. ''He's just showing you a better path and hoping you will walk along with him. He recognizes that the devil is in the details but he doesn't let that deter him.''
 Not everybody is so charmed by Mr. Lovins. Plenty of critics say many of his arguments are wrong. Even many energy experts who support much of what he proposes disagree, for example, with his conviction that there is no place for any form of nuclear energy. 
 More recently, his ''Twenty Hydrogen Myths,'' published last summer on the institute's Web site (www.rmi.org), ignited arguments about whether Mr. Lovins had misleadingly played down or ignored hurdles to moving from an economy based on oil to reliance on clean-burning hydrogen, which still must be produced from some basic energy source. 
 Critics said the paper, among other things, glossed over the potential effect on the price of natural gas, the most obvious source for hydrogen fuel in the foreseeable future. (Mr. Lovins calculated that it would actually reduce overall gas demand and prices.) 
 Even more common than assertions that Mr. Lovins is wrong are complaints that he is far too optimistic. The complaint, in which many admirers join the critics, is that Mr. Lovins repeatedly fails to account realistically for the many ways that business, government and society resist change. 
 ''He thinks that if he talks to seasoned technology people it rises to the top,'' said Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate. ''He won't listen to anyone with experience to the contrary.''
 Mr. Nader's qualms about Mr. Lovins trace in part to the Hypercar, a vision Mr. Lovins began developing in 1991. He calculated that such a vehicle would get well over 100 miles to the gallon. 
 Mr. Lovins optimistically viewed Detroit's subsequent expressions of interest as genuine. Mr. Nader saw them as one of many tactics the industry adopted to put off pressure from Washington to improve mileage with more readily available technology.
 In the end, Mr. Lovins was unable to find an auto company to embrace Hypercar fully. The concept was spun off as a for-profit subsidiary in 1999. This spring, Hypercar will show off a forging process for making high-quality carbon-fiber parts that Mr. Lovins contends can be done at 15 percent of the current cost. 
 ''We have a lot of companies that want to see it,'' Mr. Lovins said.
 Whatever becomes of Hypercar, it has been a classic example of the kind of research and demonstration program that the Rocky Mountain Institute has taken on since Amory and Hunter Lovins founded their ''think-and-do tank'' in 1982. 
 More than 70,000 people have made the journey to the 4,000-square-foot home that doubles as the institute's headquarters here, it said. Facing south and embedded in a hill, the building bristles with seven types of solar panels. Its rock faces regulate its absorption and heat loss. The centerpiece is a greenhouse where banana and other tropical fruit trees surround a fish pond fed by a small waterfall. The only heating comes from two small woodstoves that are dormant on all but the most frigid days.
 ''Snowmass tells you something about the values and mythology of R.M.I.,'' said E. Kyle Datta, a former intern who rejoined the institute in 2002 as director of research and consulting after pursing more conventional work, including a stint as head of the energy practice at Booz Allen Hamilton.
 The mythology was rocked during the late 1990's by the board's desire to make the institute more businesslike and capable of surviving without Mr. Lovins. The transition added more seasoned experts to the institute's staff, many of whom do extensive work for clients with little or no input from Mr. Lovins. The added expenses, however, helped plunge the organization deeply into the red in 2001 and 2002. 
 It also created conflicts between Marty Pickett, the institute's executive director since 1999, and Ms. Lovins, who had continued to work both on administration of the institute and on research projects with Mr. Lovins after separating from him in 1989 and their quiet divorce 10 years later. The battle with Ms. Pickett culminated in the board's decision, unopposed by Mr. Lovins, to fire his former wife. 
 The firing was presented publicly as Ms. Lovins's voluntary departure to concentrate on her own pet projects. The raw reality of the transition required Mr. Lovins to pay more attention than ever before to issues like employee morale. Since then, the institute has recovered financially and life there is calmer, but it may be more Amory-centric than ever.
 ''There's people on staff now who complement Amory's brilliant optimism,'' said Adam Albright, a board member, adding that Mr. Lovins was the central processing unit. ''If you don't have the rest of the computer built around it, you don't have useful output.''

HEADLINE: Shares Sluggish as Investors Digest Mixed Economic Data

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
A sell-off in technology stocks and buying in consumer products left Wall Street little changed yesterday as investors tried to reconcile conflicting economic data -- a surprisingly strong gross domestic product figure and a drop in a consumer confidence measure.
 The major indexes ended February mixed, stalling an 11-month rally; the Nasdaq composite index suffered its first monthly decline since September.
 The day's trading continued the listless pattern that Wall Street's showed throughout February. Strong early gains were eroded by profit taking on technology stocks, but the markets recovered somewhat by the afternoon. 
 ''We saw some selling in semiconductors that took everything with it, but there's no real reason behind it,'' said Larry Wachtel, market analyst at Wachovia Securities. ''It's a quirky kind of market.''
 Mr. Wachtel added that until economic data provide a stronger indication of the pace of the recovery, the wavering market will probably continue. The government's jobs-creation report for February expected next Friday could move the markets again, analysts said.
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 3.78 points, or 0.04 percent, to close at 10,583.92. The Dow ended the week 0.3 percent lower, its second consecutive weekly decline.
 The broader gauges were narrowly mixed. The Nasdaq composite index fell 2.75 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,029.82, finishing the week 0.4 percent lower, the sixth consecutive down week for the index.
 The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 0.03 point, to 1,144.94. It was up less than 0.1 percent for the week after last week's loss.
 For the month of February, the Nasdaq lost 1.8 percent. The Dow gained 0.9 percent and the S.&P. 500 climbed 1.2 percent -- the fifth consecutive monthly advance for both indexes.
 February lived up to its reputation as the weakest month for the stock market. But in spite of widespread expectations that stocks could retreat during the month, there was still disappointment that Wall Street's rally of the last year had gone into at least a temporary lull.
 Some of the declines for the month came from a letdown after a solid fourth-quarter earnings season. But there was also confusing economic data that deprived the market of guidance for the near future.
 Traders were pleased by the Commerce Department's report that the economy grew by an unexpected 4.1 percent annual rate in the last quarter of 2003. The government's latest data on the gross domestic product -- the broadest measure of the economy's health -- beat the 3.8 percent growth forecast by economists. The gross domestic product reflects the value of all goods and services produced within the United States.
 Initially, Wall Street did not seem dissuaded by the University of Michigan's latest consumer confidence report. The consumer sentiment index for February slid to 94.4, from 103.8 in January. The reading was in line with Wall Street expectations, however.
 ''If you look at it historically, there's a real disconnect between what consumers tell you versus what they actually do,'' said Scott Wren, equity strategist for A.G. Edwards & Sons. ''Consumers are continuing to spend money in this economy.''
 PeopleSoft lost 20 cents, to $21.58, on news that the Justice Department is seeking to block a hostile $9.4 billion bid by its larger rival, Oracle. The government's suit contends the merger would stifle competition in the business software market. Oracle slipped 41 cents, to $12.87.
 Payless ShoeSource, among many retailers releasing earnings this week, jumped 99 cents, to $13.35, after reporting a fourth-quarter loss that was not as bad as Wall Street had anticipated.
 Treasury prices rose yesterday. The 10-year Treasury note gained 17/32, to a price of 100 8/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, declined to 3.98 percent from 4.04 percent on Thursday.
 The price of the 30-year Treasury bond jumped 11/32, to 107 30/32. The bond's yield fell to 4.85 percent from 4.91 percent on Thursday.

SECTION: Section B; Column 2; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 1; What Do New Yorkers Want in a President?

LENGTH: 1191 words

HEADLINE: Wishes and Whines Are Like Everyone Else's

BYLINE: By DIANE CARDWELL

 BODY:
It is the town that likes to pride itself on being like no other, where people thrill to possibilities as endless as a Zabar's deli line and revel in problems as ubiquitous as pushcarts.
 So you might think New Yorkers would be ready, at the drop of a NoLita-chic hat, to spew their very own special set of concerns, their wish lists, wants, needs, rants and whines.
 You would be wrong. When it comes to electing a president, it turns out that in the city of Central Park, Wall Street and Broadway, voters are not so different in what they want from a Democratic candidate than voters in Berlin, N.H., or Edmond, Okla.
 Sure, a few of the dozens of New Yorkers interviewed over the past few days mentioned parochial items among their concerns, like increasing the number of B25 buses running along Court Street in Brooklyn, or getting rid of the restrictions on urban living imposed by the Bloomberg administration, or making a passing grade on the bar exam in one state valid in all others. And a few people discussed their worries about big-city problems like mass transit, aging infrastructure and homelessness -- not things you hear about much from pig farmers in Iowa. 
 But by and large, the political desires voiced along the bustling skyscraper-lined, traffic-jammed streets oddly echoed those that have surfaced in suburban cul-de-sacs, highway shopping plazas and serene country lanes from New Mexico to Maine. Voters want someone honest, they say, or someone who will end the war, or keep the city safe from terrorism, fix the economy, get rid of the deficit, build more low-cost housing, improve education or find people jobs. Or all of the above.
 ''I'm looking for anybody but Bush,'' said Alan Kellner, sounding a note that has reverberated among primary voters across the country. 
 ''I'm looking for someone who is more compassionate to the poor and middle class,'' added Mr. Kellner, who helps process health insurance information in a Brooklyn dental office, ''and a better take on how to handle the economy.''
 There is also Melvin Johnson, a Metropolitan Transportation Authority customer service representative at Grand Central Terminal who, as a black man from Harlem now living in the Bronx, would seem to have little in common with the average Democrat in a quasi-rural, overwhelmingly white state in northern New England. But ask him what his concerns are going into the primary election on Tuesday, and his answers are not far from those given by New Hampshire residents trying to assess the candidates last month.
 ''Economy, jobs, sending jobs overseas. That's another joke, O.K., because you're propping up somebody else's economy and ours is going into the toilet,'' Mr. Johnson said between bouts of clarifying track information for rail travelers. 
 ''And this war thing. Oh, we could be here all day,'' he said, noting that flat feet had saved him from a tour in Vietnam. ''They went into Iraq. I think you should get bin Laden before you go into Iraq.''
 Indeed, the war on terror was on the minds of many of the New Yorkers.
 Christa Collins, a lawyer standing at the B25 bus stop on Court Street in Brooklyn, placed security among her top national concerns. But then she laughed as she cited another political goal: ''Not having to wait forever for this bus to come every time I come here.'' 
 Ariel Jasie, a third-year student at Brooklyn Law School, said that he was interested in a candidate with a realistic economic policy, one who would re-examine the country's path to war with Iraq. ''I feel like I was taken advantage of in terms of being tricked into going into Iraq,'' he said, adding that he wished ''that W. would give us the money that he promised after 9/11.''
 Nudged to think a little more freely about what he might want from government, Mr. Jasie said: ''I wish -- I don't want to say give free law school, because everybody thinks there are too many lawyers anyway. I definitely would like to see the subway fares go back down to $1.50, but I don't think any of the candidates are going to speak to that issue.''
 Later, he added that he would like a candidate who would somehow institute reciprocity for bar exams -- pass one, pass them all.
 Martha Brinson, an administrator in the fair-hearing division of the city's welfare agency, said the candidates should be focused on finding more money for education, health care and housing rather than the war, precisely the sort of equation that crops up elsewhere along the campaign trail.
 ''Let people live and be able to live and cope with what they make,'' said Ms. Brinson, who lives in Harlem, where ''buildings that were vacant for years now were sold for like pennies to these contractors who are already billionaires.''
 ''They're pushing people who have been here for generation after generation out of New York,'' she added, ''so I hope the next president takes those issues and hopefully takes a stand for people here in the United States. I mean, sure, worry about the other countries, but I mean, come on. Do we have to, like, feed them? And give them everything?''
 Subrena Hayden and Alexis Hines, who said they were convicted felons ineligible to vote -- something they would like to see changed -- both emphasized education as a priority.
 ''Better education for the schools, more jobs for us blacks and Hispanics, you know, and equal opportunity,'' said Ms. Hayden, who said she had been convicted on a drug charge. ''That's why I'm so big on education. I got my education in prison. It's not like I didn't go, I went, but this president is making the rich richer and the poor poorer.''
 Ms. Hines, who said she had been convicted of attempted murder and a drug violation, said she sees education and alternative activities for children who are disinclined to go to school as ways to prevent future problems. ''Not just for them to be out here and get in trouble, get pregnant and anything like that -- something positive,'' she said. ''We need more things done instead of fighting for oil and stupid stuff like that.''
 At the same time, several New Yorkers said that they were more immediately engaged in what Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg was, or was not, doing than in how a president might affect the city.
 ''New York is great the way it is, but the mayor really needs to do a lot more about education,'' said Tanya Daigle, a rehabilitation counselor for heroin addicts at Bellevue Hospital Center. ''A lot of kids who go to school in the city are not given enough resources to begin with.''
 And there were those for whom all politics should be local. Asked what the candidates should be talking about on the stump, Jose Roura, who works as a mechanical engineer at an office building in Midtown Manhattan, replied: ''Getting rid of all these stupid rules that Bloomberg has put up, these silly things, like they fine you for sitting down on a milk crate. Like the pregnant girl that sits on the train steps, she gets fined, you know and things like that.'' 
 The presidential candidates, he said, should talk to the mayor, ''and tell him, you know, 'Hey, start thinking about New York and not money for the city, which is hard-working people.'''

HEADLINE: Thomas Soffron, 96, Creator of Clam Strips

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BOSTON, Feb. 27 

 BODY:
Thomas Soffron, a clam digger and entrepreneur who created clam strips, which brought low-priced fried clams to restaurants nationwide, died here last Saturday, The Boston Globe reported. He was 96. 
 Mr. Soffron and three siblings owned the Soffron Brothers Clam Company in Ipswich, Mass., which once had an exclusive deal to provide clam strips to the Howard Johnson's restaurant chain for its Tender-sweet Fried Clams.
 The clam strips were made from the ''foot'' of hard-shelled sea clams that were dredged from the ocean bottom offshore; they traveled better than did soft- shell clams that were dug by hand in areas closer to shore.
 Mr. Soffron and his brothers once operated seven processing plants, from Maryland to Nova Scotia.
 He is survived by his wife, the former Sophia Economis; two sons, Nicholas, of Ipswich, and Thomas, of Exeter, N.H.; a sister, Virginia, of Long Island; four grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: 2-Year Fight Pays Off for Hollinger Shareholders

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
It took nearly two years for restive shareholders of Hollinger International to force an investigation of Conrad M. Black, the chief executive and controlling shareholder. 
 But after nudging Lord Black out of his executive role last year, the minority shareholders won another victory Thursday. In a strongly worded decision, a Delaware Chancery Court blocked Lord Black from selling his stake in a deal that would have left them out in the cold. 
 ''The Hollinger decision is a major advance for minority shareholders because it says that directors must act on behalf of all shareholders and not in the interests of a controlling shareholder,'' said Chris Browne, the managing director at Tweedy Browne, who helped wage the fight. 
 A re-examination of the unusually bitter struggle that stripped Lord Black of control of the company shows that the dissidents were emboldened not just by the legacy of the corporate scandals. They judged that the well-known members of the Hollinger International board would wilt under fire. They also pointed to a court opinion against members of the Walt Disney Company board that the dissidents felt would give the Hollinger International directors pause. 
 Now they are free to try to find the best deal for the company's assets, including The Daily Telegraph and The Sunday Telegraph of London, The Chicago Sun-Times, and The Jerusalem Post. 
 In retrospect, the turning point was last April. Herbert Denton, the president of Providence Capital and an adviser to shareholders on corporate issues, called Mr. Browne then and asked him to help force the board to examine a number of Hollinger International payments to Lord Black.
 Lord Black dominated the board because of supervoting shares. Though he owned far less than half of the equity, he controlled 73 percent of the vote.
 Mr. Browne, whose firm owns 18 percent of Hollinger International, was ready to listen. Tweedy Browne had bought the stock at an average cost of $11 a share beginning in 1999. Last April, the price was $8.25. 
 Mr. Denton also called Staley Cates, a portfolio manager at Southeastern Asset Management, and asked for his support. Southeastern, which then owned 23 percent of Hollinger International, is a large management company that includes the Longleaf funds and that prefers to stay far out of the limelight. Mr. Denton recalls Mr. Cates' response as ''I think you have one chance in a million.'' Though rebuffed by Mr. Cates, Mr. Denton took the odds.
 On Thursday, at least, his bet seemed to be paying off.
 After being quiescent for years during the market boom, shareholders shaken by corporate scandals have begun taking a more active role in questioning boards and their support for management. As Disney prepares for its annual meeting on Wednesday, a number of institutional investors are planning to withhold their votes for the re-election of Michael D. Eisner, the chairman and chief executive, to the board. 
 In the Hollinger International case, Mr. Browne began his protest with a letter to the board in 2001 asking about the questionable payments. There was little reaction from the board or Lord Black, but Tweedy Browne stopped short of litigation. ''I am not a corporate rabble-rouser,'' said Mr. Browne, a well-known value investor whose funds manage $10 billion. 
 But Mr. Denton got the ball rolling when he approached Mr. Browne last year. Tweedy Browne demanded in mid-May that the Hollinger International board begin an investigation into millions in questionable fees that Lord Black and his top lieutenants received. 
 The company's board included an unusual lineup of public figures: Henry A. Kissinger, the former secretary of state; Richard N. Perle, the former head of the Defense Policy Board at the Pentagon; Marie-Josee Kravis, an economist married to the financier Henry Kravis; James R. Thompson, the former governor of Illinois; and Richard R. Burt, a former ambassador to Germany, among others.
 These people ''would not want to hear negative talk at every cocktail party about a company they were connected with,'' Mr. Denton recalled. ''I believed all the publicity about Lord Black would actually help us.'' 
 Mr. Denton was also aware that the opinions coming from the Delaware court, where many big United States companies are incorporated, had begun to hold corporate boards more accountable to shareholders for their oversight of management. 
 His group was encouraged by a shareholder case against the directors of Disney questioning $140 million that was paid to Michael Ovitz after his brief stint at the company. 
 The Delaware Chancery Court said last spring that the case could go forward, questioning the diligence of the board in permitting the payments and alluding to the possibility that the directors might be personally liable because they did not look out for the shareholders. 
 The opinion indicated that the failure to look out for shareholders might void the business insurance policy for the directors and officers, Mr. Denton recalled. 
 Whether or not the Disney case influenced board members, Mr. Browne said that the Disney opinion ''appeared to give shareholders more power to ask for accountability from directors.'' 
 By June, Hollinger International had set up a special committee with three independent directors and had hired Richard C. Breeden, former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, as an adviser. ''Institutional investors and Richard Breeden galvanized the board,'' said John Coffee, director of the Center on Corporate Governance at Columbia Law School. ''They got the board scared enough so that they started filling their fiduciary duties.'' 
 In six months, the special committee announced that it had hired Lazard to explore the sale of Hollinger International assets and that Lord Black had agreed not to sell his controlling stake. By then, the special committee had discovered unauthorized payments of $32.15 million to Lord Black and his lieutenants. Lord Black promised to repay his share of that.
 ''That was the our first indication that the camps -- Lord Black and his board -- were separating because of Lord Black's admission that he had taken money that the board did not know about,'' Mr. Browne recalled. 
 Additional pressure was applied by Cardinal Value Equity Partners, a hedge fund that filed suit against Hollinger International's board members, Lord Black and others seeking not just the $32 million but more than $300 million in what they called wrongful payments. 
 With a payment coming due, Lord Black refused to put up the money, but Mr. Kissinger won an extension for his first installment. But those efforts to reach an accord collapsed when Lord Black struck a deal to sell his stake -- in violation of his earlier agreement -- to the Barclays brothers of Britain. He then summarily revised Hollinger International's bylaws so that no assets could be sold without unanimous board approval.
 Infuriated, the board of Hollinger International filed suit on Jan. 26 in Delaware Chancery Court to carry out a so-called poison-pill provision that would make it prohibitively costly for the Barclays to buy out Lord Black. 
 The court's decision, which Lord Black is not expected to appeal, was as much a financial victory as a legal one for shareholders. Yesterday, Hollinger International's stock jumped $1.30, to close at $18.60 a share. That is double its price when the battle began last April.

HEADLINE: Barred Ex-Analyst Is Hired By Small Digital Developer

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
Jack B. Grubman, the former telecommunications analyst at Citigroup, has been barred from the securities industry. But he can still work wonders on a stock price.
 Yesterday, Distinctive Devices Inc., a small developer of hardware and software for the digital television and telecommunications industry in Europe, India and Russia, announced that it had hired Mr. Grubman as a strategic consultant to advise it on corporate development. 
 Shares of the company, which is based in Fort Lee, N.J., advanced 41 cents on the news, a rise of 20 percent on the day. Distinctive Devices shares, which trade on the over-the-counter bulletin board market for small companies, closed at their 52-week high, $2.45 each. 
 Mr. Grubman, the top telecommunications analyst on Wall Street until he resigned under pressure in August 2002, was known for his unflagging support for upstart telecommunications companies like WorldCom, McLeodUSA, Global Crossing, and Rhythms Netconnections. All those companies filed for bankruptcy after the technology stock market bubble burst. 
 Mr. Grubman was especially bullish on WorldCom and kept his buy rating on the stock until just a few days before the company announced the enormous accounting misstatement that helped force it into bankruptcy in July 2002. 
 Regulators sued Mr. Grubman in September 2002 for publishing misleading research. He paid a $15 million fine but settled the case, neither admitting nor denying wrongdoing. 
 Mr. Grubman's spokesman confirmed that his consulting agreement with Distinctive Devices is his first association with a company since he left Citigroup. Mr. Grubman's consulting company is the Magee Group. 
 Since his departure from Citigroup, Mr. Grubman has spent most of his time preparing his defense against the throngs of investors who have sued him for the losses they contend they incurred by following his stock advice.
 Mr. Grubman was not available for comment. 
 But Sanjay Mody, president and chief executive of Distinctive Devices, said that he met Mr. Grubman two weeks ago at a presentation Mr. Mody was making to drum up interest in his company. Mr. Grubman introduced himself, Mr. Mody said, and after the former analyst reviewed the company's technology, he made some suggestions. ''He said if he were to be there, he would add a lot of value'' to the company, especially in attracting new business, Mr. Mody said. He added that Mr. Grubman would not be involved in any financial matters at the company.
 Distinctive Devices traded as high as $48 in March 2000. The stock collapsed along with other technology concerns soon thereafter. A year ago, the shares changed hands at 45 cents a share.
 As of Sept. 30, 2003, according to the most recent company filing, it had accumulated losses of $5.4 million. In that filing, the company noted that there was a ''substantial doubt'' that it could continue as a going concern. Management is looking for financing, the filing said.
 In recent months, the company has had trouble filing its financial statements on time with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Filings have been delayed in each of the last five quarters; in November, the company said it was late because it had problems obtaining and processing financial information from its operations in India. 
 In January, Distinctive Devices acquired Galaxis Technology, a German developer of digital television technology, in an all-stock deal.
 Mr. Grubman's spokesman declined to comment on what Mr. Grubman would earn through his association with Distinctive Devices. But a person involved in the negotiations said he would be paid in stock warrants rather than a salary. Warrants entitle a holder to buy a set amount of stock in the company at some point in the future at a specified price that is usually higher than the current level. 
 Distinctive Devices, with a market value of $44 million, is a much smaller company than those Mr. Grubman advised at Citigroup. Indeed, the company's market value is the rough equivalent of two years' pay for Mr. Grubman during his heyday. 
 Mr. Mody said he evaluated the downside his company might face hiring Mr. Grubman. ''There may be several people because of his past issues who might hate a company like ours,'' he said. ''But there will be some people who know the bright side of Jack Grubman -- he knows the technology, he knows the trends -- and they would like to talk with the company.''

HEADLINE: 30 Little Turtles

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: BANGALORE, India 

 BODY:
Indians are so hospitable. I got an ovation the other day from a roomful of Indian 20-year-olds just for reading perfectly the following paragraph: ''A bottle of bottled water held 30 little turtles. It didn't matter that each turtle had to rattle a metal ladle in order to get a little bit of noodles, a total turtle delicacy. The problem was that there were many turtle battles for less than oodles of noodles.''
 I was sitting in on an ''accent neutralization'' class at the Indian call center 24/7 Customer. The instructor was teaching the would-be Indian call center operators to suppress their native Indian accents and speak with a Canadian one -- she teaches British and U.S. accents as well, but these youths will be serving the Canadian market. Since I'm originally from Minnesota, near Canada, and still speak like someone out of the movie ''Fargo,'' I gave these young Indians an authentic rendition of ''30 Little Turtles,'' which is designed to teach them the proper Canadian pronunciations. Hence the rousing applause. 
 Watching these incredibly enthusiastic young Indians preparing for their call center jobs -- earnestly trying to soften their t's and roll their r's -- is an uplifting experience, especially when you hear from their friends already working these jobs how they have transformed their lives. Most of them still live at home and turn over part of their salaries to their parents, so the whole family benefits. Many have credit cards and have become real consumers, including of U.S. goods, for the first time. All of them seem to have gained self-confidence and self-worth.
 A lot of these Indian young men and women have college degrees, but would never get a local job that starts at $200 to $300 a month were it not for the call centers. Some do ''outbound'' calls, selling things from credit cards to phone services to Americans and Europeans. Others deal with ''inbound'' calls -- everything from tracing lost luggage for U.S. airline passengers to solving computer problems for U.S. customers. The calls are transferred here by satellite or fiber optic cable.
 I was most taken by a young Indian engineer doing tech support for a U.S. software giant, who spoke with pride about how cool it is to tell his friends that he just spent the day helping Americans navigate their software. A majority of these call center workers are young women, who not only have been liberated by earning a decent local wage (and therefore have more choice in whom they marry), but are using the job to get M.B.A.'s and other degrees on the side.
 I gathered a group together, and here's what they sound like: M. Dinesh, who does tech support, says his day is made when some American calls in with a problem and is actually happy to hear an Indian voice: ''They say you people are really good at what you do. I am glad I reached an Indian.'' Kiran Menon, when asked who his role model was, shot back: ''Bill Gates -- [I dream of] starting my own company and making it that big.'' I asked C. M. Meghna what she got most out of the work: ''Self-confidence,'' she said, ''a lot of self-confidence, when people come to you with a problem and you can solve it -- and having a lot of independence.'' Because the call center teams work through India's night -- which corresponds to America's day -- ''your biological clock goes haywire,'' she added. ''Besides that, it's great.''
 There is nothing more positive than the self-confidence, dignity and optimism that comes from a society knowing it is producing wealth by tapping its own brains -- men's and women's -- as opposed to one just tapping its own oil, let alone one that is so lost it can find dignity only through suicide and ''martyrdom.''
 Indeed, listening to these Indian young people, I had a deja vu. Five months ago, I was in Ramallah, on the West Bank, talking to three young Palestinian men, also in their 20's, one of whom was studying engineering. Their hero was Yasir Arafat. They talked about having no hope, no jobs and no dignity, and they each nodded when one of them said they were all ''suicide bombers in waiting.''
 What am I saying here? That it's more important for young Indians to have jobs than Americans? Never. But I am saying that there is more to outsourcing than just economics. There's also geopolitics. It is inevitable in a networked world that our economy is going to shed certain low-wage, low-prestige jobs. To the extent that they go to places like India or Pakistan -- where they are viewed as high-wage, high-prestige jobs -- we make not only a more prosperous world, but a safer world for our own 20-year-olds.

HEADLINE: For Illegal Subletters, an Offer to Come In From the Cold

BYLINE: By SETH KUGEL

 BODY:
They crossed the heavily trafficked border and have since lived an anonymous existence in the densely populated city of high-rises, holding down jobs, raising children and hoping the authorities would never find them. But now, offered amnesty, they have a chance to become legal and never again fear deportation -- to the other side of the New England Thruway.
 Amnesty proposals for illegal immigrants may be caught up in election-year politics in Washington, but amnesty for illegal subletters in Co-op City, the 15,372-unit complex in the northeast Bronx, has arrived. 
 The illegal subletters -- no one knows how many there are -- exist largely because of economics. Buyers of apartments in Co-op City must meet requirements involving income and other criteria, and they pay reduced prices for their apartments, currently $1,950 a room, or $11,700 for a six-room apartment. So when families move out, they often do so quietly, subletting illegally to relatives, friends or strangers, and sometimes turning a nice profit.
 ''We're giving them a chance to legitimize,'' Al Shapiro, president of Co-op City's board, said of this population.
 For a two-month period that ends in mid-April, illegal residents may apply to buy their apartments from the current owners, allowing them to sidestep the long waiting list. 
 Afterwards, Co-op City will step up enforcement against illegal subletters, said Herb Freedman of Marion Scott Real Estate, which manages the complex. 
 According to Mr. Freedman, the amnesty plan had been in the works for several years, but was delayed by such issues as crumbling parking garages, a debate over whether the complex should go private and negotiations over a refinancing arrangement with the state.
 In interviews, Co-op City residents said they doubted that too many people would come forward, explaining that many illegal subletters already knew that they were not eligible and would keep quiet. Other residents said they thought it unlikely that subletters would trust management's word or implicate the people they rented from.
 ''Someone does you a favor and now you're going to turn them in?'' said Alex Brown, 60, who has lived in Co-op City for 32 years.
 In the first week of the amnesty, 18 people inquired about the plan anonymously, using names like Hope 132, Silent 420 and Casper 007. Three have submitted applications to buy their apartments. Management hopes that many more will follow before the deadline.
 ''They crossed into the wilds of the Bronx,'' Mr. Shapiro said, ''and they must be recognized.'' SETH KUGEL

HEADLINE: Sierra Leone and Connecticut: The Connection Continues to Grow

BYLINE: By JOE WOJTAS

 BODY:
THE construction several years ago of a replica of the schooner Amistad by Mystic Seaport shipbuilders has led to a connection between several Connecticut groups and the people of Sierra Leone aimed at improving life in the West African nation.
 In December nine people from groups including Amistad America and the Amistad Committee of New Haven, Mystic Seaport, the First Church of Christ Congregational in Farmington and the Connecticut Woodturners, made their fifth trip to Sierra Leone. They met with President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, his government ministers and villagers to discuss the various efforts, most of which are already under way. 
 These include the planting of 100 trees for each of the 53 -- symbolizing the number of slaves aboard the original Amistad -- cut down to build the replica boat. The projects also include the development of fish farms adjacent to the tree grove, the creation of an Amistad exhibition for the country and finding markets in the United States for the works of local craftsmen. 
 The group's major initiative is an effort to preserve the overgrown, crumbling ruins at Bunce Island, a major 18th-century slave trading outpost, and making it an international destination for cultural tourism.
 ''These are very, very important efforts for my country,'' said Ibrahim Kamara, Sierra Leone's ambassador to the United Nations. ''These people have been tremendous and done much good for my country and my people. They've been warmly received by my people when they have traveled to Sierra Leone, and they deserve it.''
 The slaves aboard the original Amistad were from what is now Sierra Leone. While being transported along the coast of Cuba in 1839, one of them, Sengbe Pieh, led an uprising in which the slaves killed the captain and cook and captured the ship. They tried to force the Spanish slave owners on board to sail them back to Africa but the men changed course at night and the ship wandered up the East Coast as rumors spread about a ship of black pirates. 
 While the ship was anchored off Montauk, N.Y., a government revenue cutter captured it and towed it into New London Harbor. The slaves were jailed in New Haven as both blacks and whites came to their aid. Trials followed and the case ended up before the United States Supreme Court where former President John Quincy Adams argued for the slaves' freedom. The court ruled they had been illegally kidnapped and granted them their freedom more than two decades before the end of the Civil War.
 Those who survived the ordeal returned to Sierra Leone in 1842, and Sengbe Pieh remains a national hero. Before they returned, however, they lived and were educated in Farmington by the Congregational church. That effort, along with those of the abolitionists, led to the founding of hundreds of schools for blacks including the country's traditional black colleges.
 Mystic Seaport built a replica of the Amistad that was launched during a ceremony in 2000 that attracted government officials from Sierra Leone. The ship is now based out of New Haven and sails to ports around the country telling the Amistad's story of freedom and cooperation among those of different races.
 The connection between the people of the United States and Sierra Leone, though, goes much deeper than the Amistad. While the majority of the millions of African slaves shipped to the Americas from African slave castles went to the Caribbean and South America, most of those who went through Bunce Island were taken to Georgia and South Carolina because of their ability to cultivate rice. Today much of their culture and tradition survive among descendants who can trace their roots to what is now Sierra Leone. 
 ''In many ways Sierra Leone is almost a sister country to us,'' Peter Glankoff, the Seaport's director of communications, said after making the most recent trip. 
 The man most responsible for the relationship is Alfred Marder , who heads the Amistad Committee. When the group dedicated a statue of Sengbe Pieh in 1992, officials from Sierra Leone traveled to New Haven for the ceremony. 
 Mr. Marder has made all five trips. On the first trip, he and the Seaport's Quentin Snediker, who headed construction of the replica Amistad, helped secure wood from the iroko and kola trees to create a symbolic connection with the homeland of the Amistad captives. On the second trip, Mr. Marder initiated the idea of planting trees to create the Amistad Friendship Grove, which was done in 2001. Because the need for charcoal has caused a deforestation problem in Sierra Leone, the 5,300 fast-growing trees will now provide fuel and jobs while protecting the forest.
 On the third trip, Mr. Marder said, he noticed a nearby stream and suggested creating a fish farm that could provide a source of protein for the impoverished villagers. The groups raised $20,000 to start the fish farm. On the latest trip, Mr. Marder said they pledged to raise the additional money needed for a second farm. 
 Mr. Snediker and John Lorch, the head of the Connecticut Woodturners group, also talked with government officials about gaining access to United States markets for those who create indigenous crafts such as baskets, carvings and textiles. He said the effort would help preserve the craftsmen's skills, provide them with income and support a environmentally sensitive business. 
 There was also much discussion about the effort to preserve the ruins of the so-called slave castles at Bunce Island and make them a tourist destination. The site could become a popular one for black Americans because most of the slaves who passed through its fort-like stone walls came to the United States. More well-known slave castles, such as Goree Island in Senegal, sent slaves to the Caribbean and South America.
 The plan is for the groups to start a nonprofit organization to raise the money needed to update a preservation plan for the slave castle. Sierra Leone would then petition to become a member of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and go to the international community for funding. 
 ''For people of African descent in the United States there is so little direct connection with their past. But this is one of them,'' said Mr. Snediker, who discussed the Bunce Island project with Sierra Leonean officials on the December trip. 
 ''It's a treasure, a jewel,'' said Mr. Snediker. ''We're seeking ways to develop it and bring it to the world.'' 
 Mr. Marder said the connection between the two countries is important because of the historical significance of the Amistad story. 
 ''It was the first human rights case to come before the Supreme Court,'' he said. ''It was the first time blacks and whites came to together to struggle against slavery.'' 
 Because so many people from what is now Sierra Leone were brought here as slaves, he said, they made a vast contribution to the economic growth of the United States. 
 ''We owe a tremendous debt to the people of Sierra Leone,'' he said. ''In a way, we're doing this because we owe it to them as a country. These people helped build our country and history has tied the two of us together.''
 Mr. Glankoff said the projects are not a typical humanitarian effort in which people bring money and supplies and then go home. The projects begun by the groups will be owned and run by the people of Sierra Leone. 
 ''A real friend is someone who will help you help yourself,'' he said. ''We saw so much of our country in their country. We all have the same hopes, dreams and aspirations.''

HEADLINE: Riding Out Downturn, Start-Ups Are Poised For Upside

BYLINE: By ALLAN RICHTER

 BODY:
MICHAEL and Leslie Ciriaco of Merrick sell greeting cards online. Andy Calimano of Babylon runs his own marketing firm. And Karin Eckert of Port Washington is a landscape and garden consultant.
 The entrepreneurs are self-employed, but with a sobering qualifier -- they started their businesses as the economic slowdown of the last few years began to take root. During downturns, the ranks of the self-employed swell with workers armed with fresh pink slips and maybe some severance pay to help finance their new ventures. 
 Ms. Eckert, 63, was let go in 2000 from her six-figure administrative job at Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center in Brooklyn. Mr. Calimano, 38, lost his job at the LinkShare Corporation, an Internet marketing company in Manhattan, in 2001. The Ciriacos' circumstances were different: Mrs. Ciriaco, 35, left her job as a Rockette at Radio City Music Hall when she became pregnant with her first son in 1998, and her husband continued his job as the executive chef at the Ramada Plaza J.F.K., near Kennedy Airport. 
 Ms. Eckert, Mr. Calimano and the Ciriacos share the same success story. They have passed the two-year point -- most start-ups fail in their first two years -- and they have successfully ridden out the economic downturn and reached what most local economists agree is an economic recovery, albeit a muted one.
 Pearl M. Kamer, the chief economist at the Long Island Association, said businesses begun during the slowdown would quite likely be a ''springboard for the next surge in employment growth,'' which she expects this year. 
 ''What's happened in this business cycle is very similar to what happened on Long Island in the late 1980's and early 1990's, when we lost much of our defense industry base,'' Dr. Kamer said. ''At that time many engineers had ideas for new products or services of their own, based on defense technology in large measure. They applied those to civilian markets. By the late 1990's many of these businesses started to grow and hire people.''
 In the next business cycle, telecom and information technology workers who lost their jobs will be the ones doing the hiring, Dr. Kamer said. 
 Mr. Calimano agreed. ''Usually when there are downturns, people get entrepreneurial, and hopefully they become the next generation of established businesses,'' he said. ''That's what we're hoping to do.'' 
 Mr. Calimano said he and his business partner, Chris Consorte, have already hired five people for their marketing firm, Integrated Direct, which combines traditional print and Internet marketing services. Friends did not encourage their new venture. As Mr. Calimano put it: ''We did hear: 'Why are you investing your time? Why don't you go for a more traditional job? Why are you coupling your direct-marketing backgrounds with the Internet?' We just felt there were a lot of opportunities. We always had faith in the Internet.''
 Mr. Calimano, Ms. Eckert and the Ciriacos appear to have survived the downturn by rigorously following some basic tenets of start-up survival: reinvesting profits in their businesses and working long hours. 
 The Ciriacos' progression from chef and Rockette to their own greeting card and announcement business, and Ms. Eckert's move from hospital administrator to landscape designer, are less obvious than Mr. Calimano's transition within the online marketing world. Even so, the Ciriacos and Ms. Eckert say their new businesses were not a huge leap.
 When the Ciriacos first began considering their own business four years ago, they planned to capitalize on Mr. Ciriaco's experience as a chef by beginning a cooking Web site. At the time, the couple happened to be choosing birth announcements for the arrival of their son. The idea of a greeting card company appealed to them, and they quickly shifted gears.
 The Ciriacos decided to call their business e-Announcements and Invitations.com, taking orders online and then sending greeting cards, birth announcements and wedding invitations to their customers. For Mr. Ciriaco, a typical day in the first years of the business began at 5 a.m. He would sit at a computer designing cards, printing them and taking orders until midafternoon, when he would go off to work as a chef. 
 His wife, meanwhile, juggled business and motherhood -- their son Michael is now 4, and their son Zachary is 2. After putting the children to bed, Mrs. Ciriaco would fill orders until her husband arrived home, sometimes after midnight.
 Mr. Ciriaco said he was driven by a fear of failing during the weak economy. Money was scarce as the Ciriacos plowed earnings back into their business. ''When we went to the grocery store, we were removing items from our grocery cart as this thing was starting up,'' Mr. Ciriaco recalled. ''There were 50 times that we nearly quit. It was rough.''
 Sometimes the couple improvised, asking the U.P.S. driver to watch the children in a pinch. ''She would buy us 15 or 20 minutes as we boxed up our last order,'' Mr. Ciriaco said.
 Ms. Eckert, the former hospital administrator, could not have asked for better timing for her foray into garden design. Months before her hospital job ended, she began taking horticulture classes at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. Then, as she was looking for another health-care job, the State Labor Department invited her to join a self-employment program for people who had lost their jobs. 
 With the help of a job counselor, Ms. Eckert came up with a business plan to become a landscape consultant and designer. She began dipping into her and her husband's retirement savings for what would amount to $25,000 in start-up costs. Half a year after her hospital job ended, she had her own business, Garden Elements, up and running.
 Confident in her concept, she only briefly considered the risks of beginning a business in a rocky economy. ''It's the kind of business that, even in a down economy, would have customers because people would still do landscaping and want a garden or want planters put up on their property,'' she said. It helped that her immediate market was Port Washington, brimming with upscale, environmentally aware clients. Ms. Eckert handles all phases of gardening, from design to maintenance. She puts in the smaller plants herself and arranges for suppliers to handle the larger trees and shrubs. 
 Ms. Eckert said she lost money in her first year, barely broke even in her second and turned a profit last year. The Ciriacos say their business was profitable early on: revenues totaled $100,000 in 2001, $200,000 in 2002 and $320,000 last year. Mr. Calimano, the Internet marketer, said his firm lost money in its first three years and turned a profit in 2002, although from the start, revenue doubled each year.
 All of the businesses appear poised for stronger growth. ''If you can start a business in somewhat of a down economy and keep it going when the economy turns, you're in a really good position,'' said Lucille Wesnofske, the director of the New York State Small Business Development Center at Farmingdale State University. ''If you're keeping your business going, you've got some kind of a customer base and a reputation. That just gets better and better when the economy turns around.''

HEADLINE: Hot and Cold on the State Purse

BYLINE: By JOHN SULLIVAN

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
WHEN environmentalists say there is green in Governor McGreevey's budget plan for next year, they are not just talking about the color of money.
 Although he did not praise environmental aspects of his proposal when he released it last week, the governor called for a number of fees and taxes intended to strengthen a variety of environmental programs, from hazardous waste cleanup to removal of tire piles -- part of a long-term move to shift the cost of environmental enforcement from taxpayers to polluters. The effort is loudly applauded by environmentalists but condemned by businesses that say it is an unfair burden.
 ''Business is already making the argument they are getting nickel-and-dimed to death,'' said David Pringle, campaign director for the New Jersey Environmental Federation. ''But all of these things are trying to discourage polluting acts, whether it is a tire dump, or toxic air emissions or contaminating lands.'' 
 If he succeeds in winning approval of the budget in the Legislature, Mr. McGreevey will bolster his administration's record with environmentalists. Last year, that same constituency was disappointed when the governor had to withdraw a statewide development plan, called the Big Map, because of strong opposition from developers and local officials.
 Still, Mr. McGreevey has generally received high marks from environmentalists like Mr. Pringle. The new state budget plan, Mr. Pringle said, continues Mr. McGreevey's policy of increasingly relying on business fees as well as penalties levied against companies that pollute the environment to pay for enforcement of environmental regulations. Environmental groups have said that this is good policy.
 ''Having polluters pay is not only an issue of fundamental fairness, it also discourages pollution,'' Mr. Pringle said.
 But business groups dislike the plan and the philosophy. They say the governor has gone too far with fees and extra penalties and is trying to pay for environmental enforcement on the backs of already overburdened companies.
 Businesses are particularly incensed over the governor's decision to extend a change in the corporate business tax that made it harder for companies to reduce taxes by offsetting profits with old losses. They say the governor promised to remove the change after two years. Extending it is expected to generate about $300 million in the next fiscal year, with a large part of those proceeds going to finance the Department of Environmental Protection.
 ''It is a broken promise,'' said Philip Kirschner, president of the New Jersey Business and Industry Association, which represents about 21,000 companies. ''This was sold to the business community two years ago as a temporary budget fix for two years. Now the extension is for at least one more year.''
 Mr. Kirschner said the extension would hurt manufacturers in particular because they are just beginning to climb out of several years of losses. 
 ''It is very poor economic policy to hit these manufacturers when they are down,'' he said. 
 In general, McGreevey administration officials have said that changes to the corporate business tax are intended to spread the tax burden between businesses and individual taxpayers. Micah Rasmussen, the governor's press secretary, said the governor disputed business groups' contentions that the change to the tax has hurt the business climate, and he cited data that shows New Jersey's economy has been growing faster than any other state's in the Northeast.
 ''We don't believe what we have done is hampering the economy,'' Mr. Rasmussen said. ''People making a decision on where they want to do business want to do business in a place that has clean air and clean water. The commitment to the environment helps us, it does not hurt us.''
 To that end, the environmental commissioner, Bradley M. Campbell, said the state had been rebuilding his department's enforcement arm, which had been cut back under Mr. McGreevey's predecessor, Christie Whitman. 
 ''In the area of enforcement, fines and penalties have increased by a third'' since Governor McGreevey took office, he said. ''With respect to collecting damages to restore damage to the environment, we have collected more in two years than the Whitman administration did in eight.''
 Of course, enforcement has to be paid for, and one way Mr. McGreevey has done so is through increased fees. The new state budget plan, for example, proposes to clean up tire piles around the state with a tax on new tires; increased fees on companies producing air toxins, primarily from power plants; and fees charged to out-of-state companies that transport hazardous waste to New Jersey for disposal.
 Mr. McGreevey has also proposed a 1 percent tax on ''McMansions,'' new houses selling for more than $1 million.
 Though opponents of suburban sprawl welcome the McMansion tax, builders are not so happy with it. They say the governor has already done too much to slow the construction of new housing.
 ''The administration has demonstrated it can use the Department of Environmental Protection to suffocate housing opportunities,'' said Patrick J. O'Keefe, chief executive officer of the 2,000-member New Jersey Builders Association. ''It has yet to demonstrate it has anyone in the administration who is concerned about creating them.''
 Mr. O'Keefe said the McMansion tax would probably would not have much practical effect on home sales: buyers who can afford homes at that price probably will not be dissuaded by a 1 percent tax. But he said it reflected policies that discourage building in a state where the average home price, at $324,000, is twice what the average family could afford.
 ''The governor has turned his back on people who need a place to live,'' he said.
 Susan Bass Levin, commissioner of the Department of Community Affairs, said the builders were being unfair. ''Governor McGreevey's administration has financed over 16,700 affordable housing units in the last two years,'' she said, ''almost twice as much as in the previous two years.''
 Planning groups are split on the housing issue. Susan M. Burrows, spokeswoman for New Jersey Future, a nonprofit planning organization, said, ''This is a really strong budget on protection for the environment.'' But Ms. Burrows said her organization thought the governor could do more to encourage new housing in urban areas and discourage sprawl in the suburbs.
 ''This administration has done a lot of work on stopping growth in the wrong places,'' she said. ''But all the environmental protections in the world are not going to work if we don't make it easier to grow in the right places.''
 Jeff Tittel, director of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, disagreed, arguing that the McGreevey administration had improved regulations that govern new development and encourages development in more urban areas. Although he said the McMansion tax would probably have little practical effect, it was one of the most important symbolic statements in the budget plan because large, expensive houses ''are a blight on the landscape that is chewing up open space,'' he said.
 Mr. McGreevey's proposals, Mr. Tittel said, are moving in the right direction.
 ''I think the overall message is if you pollute New Jersey's environment, you are going to have to compensate the public,'' he said. ''That is a good thing. It is another incentive to clean up the environment.''

On the Streets
 Last spring, the Actors Shakespeare Company of Hoboken lost its home at the Stevens Institute of Technology and could not present its usual September-to-May season. It has been performing staged readings at the Jersey City Museum instead.
 The company, which was founded in the fall of 2000, has searched for a new performance space without success. Then its producing artistic director, Colette Rice, had an idea: to pitch a tent on the 13th Street Pier in Hoboken and present a summer festival.
 ''The Shipyard Shakespeare Festival,'' or ''Shipyard Shakes,'' as the company calls it, would be the company's first summer festival. It has been planned for weekends, mid-July through mid-August, with a run of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' Performances will be free. 
 Provident Bank is providing money, but it is not enough, said Ms. Rice, who is seeking other sponsors and public money.
 The staged readings continue at the museum through May. The company's search for a permanent home also continues. Information: www.ascnj.org.

'A Difficult Topic'
 Kabu Okai-Davies, founder and executive director of Newark's African Globe Theaterworks, and Solomon F. Caudle, the company's director-in-residence, wrote ''When a Man Loves a Woman'' in 1999 to address the problems of HIV and AIDS in Newark. ''The idea was to tackle a difficult topic in an entertaining way,'' Mr. Caudle said.
 The drama, which features original music by Kathy D. Harrison, tells the story of a married woman who finds out she is HIV-positive, apparently from a relationship before her marriage.
 The piece had its premiere in 2000 at Newark Symphony Hall and will return there for another run from Friday through March 28. From June 17 to 20, it will be performed at Crossroads Theater in New Brunswick, and in October at Lincoln Theater in Washington. Information: (973)624-1584.

A Lost Voice
 In the early 1990's, Irwin Chusid, a D.J. for 29 years at WFMU, based in Jersey City, discovered a record album of radio dramas made by a man named Judson Fountain.
 Mr. Chusid's friend Don Brockway had bought the album in a secondhand store for a dollar. The record, made by Mr. Fountain with help from friends, featured two amateurish radio dramas modeled on those made in the 1920's, 30's and 40's. Sample dialogue: ''Now you see this? If you don't know what it is, I'll tell you. It's a gun.''
 ''He didn't display a lot of talent,'' said Mr. Chusid of Mr. Fountain. ''But he did display a lot of enthusiasm.'' 
 Mr. Chusid began playing Mr. Fountain's record during his radio shows, eliciting strong reactions -- both positive and negative -- from listeners and other D.J.'s. He later found out about other albums Mr. Fountain had made, between 1969 and 1974. ''They were every bit as strong, wonderful and outsider as the first one,'' he said. 
 He also met Mr. Fountain, who was born in 1952 and lived in Jersey City and worked as a diner deliveryman, Mr. Chusid said. Mr. Fountain even performed some of his dramas on Mr. Chusid's show on the day before Halloween in 1995, he added.
 A few years later, Mr. Chusid tried to find Mr. Fountain again; he could not. But a few years after that, Mr. Chusid's girlfriend, Barbara Economon, suggested that they produce a CD of Mr. Fountain's work.
 The result is ''Completely in the Dark: Tales of Mystery and Suspense by Judson Fountain,'' a compilation of Mr. Fountain's radio dramas recorded from 1969 to 1974, to be released on March 24 by Innova Records, a nonprofit label in St. Paul, Minn.
 Meanwhile, Mr. Chusid has continued to try to find Mr. Fountain, with no success.
 ''Judson's work is characterized by cliche scripting, egregious ethnic accents, and inept editing -- all seasoned with copious needle drops of creaking doors and howling wolves from the timeless Elektra sound effects library,'' Mr. Chusid writes in the liner notes. ''But this extreme amateurism and unwavering sincerity synergize to great advantage in Fountain's theatricals.''

HEADLINE: Is McGreevey Following In Florio's Footsteps?

BYLINE: By Iver Peterson. 
Iver Peterson reports from New Jersey for The New York Times.

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
In the media scrum on the floor of the Assembly chamber after Governor McGreevey's budget address, a few scribblers surrounded Senator Leonard Lance, the Republican minority leader and so the highest-ranking Republican in the state.
 The reporters wanted Mr. Lance to agree with them that Governor McGreevey, after all those months as being treated as something of a joke, was now, rather suddenly, in command of the state in a way he had never been. After all, didn't he finally have Democrats in control of both houses, a rising economy to take the heat off his $26.2 billion budget proposal, and a Republican opposition largely bereft of new ideas? 
 Mr. Lance was not going to be trapped by the liberal media conspiracy's spin. ''I would say he is in the same position as Jim Florio in 1991,'' he said.
 In other words, Mr. Lance thinks the governor is cruisin' for a bruisin'.
 There are some similarities between Mr. McGreevey and Mr. Florio, the previous Democratic governor.
 For instance, in terms of the budget, both first termers were looking to close budget gaps and still pay for the things Democrats like social programs for the deserving middle class.
 And like Mr. McGreevey, Mr. Florio had a Democratic majority in both houses large enough to inspire a certain reckless confidence about his ability to find a way ahead without having to worry too much about what the Republicans thought. 
 But there are also yawning differences. In 1991, New Jersey still had another year go before coming out of the worst recession since the Great Depression, and Mr. Florio -- operating on the novel idea that governments should not spend money they didn't have -- rammed through huge tax increases to keep the budget balanced.
 That opened the way to an anti-tax backlash that ended Mr. Florio's career in politics and brought eight years of Republican rule that redefined how budgets are made in New Jersey.
 Judging by the budget he introduced on Tuesday, Mr. McGreevey has learned the lesson well. His plan certainly gets a boost from a rising economy, but he also continues a tradition begun by former Gov. Christie Whitman of borrowing to plug the gaps -- $1.5 billion in direct borrowing against the proceeds of new taxes and surcharges, and millions more by putting off other payments.
 As the governor made clear in his address, he is counting the rising economy's growth in income, sales and corporate taxes to pay for his borrowing and to see him on to a second term next year. In this he believes he is luckier than Mr. Florio, for whom the long boom of the 1990's came too late. 
 For his part, James Hughes, dean of the Bloustein School at Rutgers, is inclined to support Mr. McGreevey's gamble.
 ''My best estimate now is that there is room for some optimism on the economy,'' Mr. Hughes said. 
 He noted that the state has added jobs at a faster rate than the nation as whole, and that New Jersey should only accelerate as the overall economy improves. 
 Or, as Mr. Hughes put it, ''We faced strong national headwinds and they have finally turned around, and that should help us.''
 The governor's treasury people say they have been in touch with the bond rating firms throughout the budget-making process, so the idea of borrowing $1.5 billion against the proceeds of the new 45-cent-a-pack cigarette tax and surcharges on driving infractions will not come as a surprise to Wall Street.
 What no one can predict with certainty is the effect that paying $6 for a pack cigarettes will have on smokers in the state. Will they finally quit puffing, will they hop in their cars and run down to Delaware for cheaper smokes, or will they buy from the smugglers the cigarette industry says always follow in the wake of higher taxes? There is a chance that cigarette sales will drop off faster than the budget predicts, jeopardizing the bond repayments.
 John E. McCormac, the state treasurer, said last week that he would be willing to pay higher interest on the bonds if they could be structured so the risk of an eventual default could be passed to the bond holders. If that doesn't work, a big piece of the budget could go up in, um, smoke. 
 Then Mr. McGreevey will know how Jim Florio felt.

BYLINE: By MARY ANN D'URSO. 
Mary Ann D'Urso is working on a novel and lives in Bloomfield.

 BODY:
IT is time to come clean. For most of my adult reproductive years, I avoided the mold that life has now rather ironically and unceremoniously cast me in: that of a hausfrau in suburban New Jersey. 
 For several years I did well as a newspaper reporter. Then I switched to editing law firm divas and eventually to teaching high school literature. These were certainly not paths for the faint of heart, but now I can only imagine a life in the Marines as the last stop on the career train of testing my mettle. 
 The thing I've come to appreciate the most is that when you're a housewife, there is always something or someone to take care of. Sorting the mail, emptying the dishwasher or ironing are the things you do on your way to handling the carpenters or figuring out why water is gushing from the second-floor overhang or what is causing the circuit to randomly trip the central air-conditioning system. Who knew, when I decided to leave teaching last summer in search of what was once a life with time and money, that months of unemployment would whip me into this unplanned marriage? 
 Let's face it: my mother, who has far more tendencies of the male hunter/1950's provider type, has never been happier since she got a wife. At 78, she cheerfully toddles off to work while I sit with a cup of coffee, engage my disgust at the headlines and think about whether the bananas are mushy enough to make bread. If only someone would pay me and cover my health benefits, I may have found my dream job.
 Oh, I know what you're thinking. But let me set the record straight. My mother thrives on working outside the home. In a different generation, she would have been a mergers and acquisitions lawyer. I know this from watching her draw blood from appliance salesmen over expensive gadgetry. There's one more thing. When my mother was 67, she retired from the import-export business. The critical subtext was that my father was also retired. So a year later, when the phone call came that the brother-in-law of the son of her former business partner needed some office help, it was worth the daily drive to urban Hoboken for my mother, who had seldom driven far beyond the borders of suburban Essex County. When my father died, going to work did much more for her than sitting with grief. 
 Since my dad's death, we decided to share the house and the bills. So, as the summer advanced, job applications remained unanswered and my guilt grew over the decision not to return to teaching, I did the only thing I could. I listened as any good wife does to my mom's stories about the characters in the office or how she had figured out a printer problem or that her friend at work might have cancer. And I headed directly to the back 40, where I spent months landscaping with the Belgian blocks I dug up on our property and using the last of the slate left over from a wall I had built earlier. 
 Sometimes I headed to the local paint store, where I've become one of the regulars. It's hard to know whether it's my adoration of Benny Moore or the smart-aleck commentary that keeps me coming back. Maybe it's the picture I'll always have of a bear-sized man standing behind the counter demonstrating a faux-finish technique in the air. ''Lightly dab the sponge and blot off excess,'' he began as if holding a sea sponge in either hand. ''Remember, random gentle random gentle,'' he whispered, his hands alternating on an invisible wall. ''You don't want patterns or gobs.'' Indeed. And there's nothing like hearing ''Where you been?'' when my pursuits of copper-topped caps for the deck posts or a chrome drainage assembly unit for the claw-foot tub have kept me away. Of course, I also spent hours with assorted electricians and carpenters, but please don't tell the paint store guys. 
 In all these months, my mother has not only been a good provider, she has been a good friend. As I continue to drive us into debt, she encourages me to find something that will give me satisfaction. Out of habit, I continue reading job postings for editors, writers, admin assistants, research associates. I notice there's a run on cardiologists. I think about what I'll make for dinner and smile to think that I have finally gotten my mother, who loves chips, Mozart and chocolate, to eat salmon and salad (thank goodness for organic gorgonzola). I'm knitting scarves like crazy and my family wonders if somewhere there's a cottage industry. I think about cooking school and wonder how I will reinvent myself. Mostly, I think about how easy it is to feel invisible or unimportant when you live in a culture that rewards making money and you aren't. 
 Yet, I know the names of the two men who alternate delivering our mail. The plumbing-supply guy gives me a discount because I could have gone to Home Depot and didn't. Our German carpenters have eaten well on homemade Sicilian pizza and bitter greens. The post office clerks smile and cross their fingers when I send out a short story. My octogenarian neighbor tells me about local history and how he misses his sister who died several years back. None of this adds up to a whole lot of anything except a life. A visible life.

HEADLINE: The Culture Wars, Part II

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

DATELINE: Washington 

 BODY:
IT became an emblematic moment: Patrick Buchanan, standing before the Republican National Convention in August 1992, bluntly declaring that there was a ''religious war'' and a ''cultural war'' under way for the soul of the country. And that ''Clinton and Clinton are on the other side,'' with an agenda of ''radical feminism,'' ''abortion on demand'' and ''homosexual rights.''
 The cultural gulf between left and right, liberal and social conservative, secularist and fundamentalist, had rarely yawned so wide, nor has it since, some analysts say. By the late 1990's, in fact, some were declaring that the culture war was over, even if they disagreed about who won it. But culture wars wax and wane. And in recent days, as the nation furiously debated gay marriage, Mel Gibson's movie, ''The Passion of the Christ'' and Janet Jackson's raunchy half-time show at the Super Bowl, the culture war seemed to be waxing again.
 It has not reached the intensity of 1992, but scholars say these cultural divisions could be heightened by a tough, close election. The parties are increasingly polarized, and many of their core constituents are in an uncompromising mood. The courts have been pushing the envelope on issues like gay rights, just as they did on abortion. Social and religious conservatives feel under siege, furious over what they see as judicial tyranny that is removing traditional values, one by one, from the public square. 
 ''I have not seen any issue that mobilizes my constituency like same sex marriage, not even the abortion issue,'' said Dr. Richard Land, president of the Southern Baptist Convention Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission. ''Once you start redefining marriage, where do you stop? I'm still waiting for someone to give me that answer.''
 Michael Novak, a theologian at the American Enterprise Institute, said, ''Many of those who are alarmed by the claiming of the title of marriage by homosexuals feel the issue is being thrust upon them. They feel on the defensive. They see themselves as getting pushed around.''
 Gay rights advocates, for their part, see themselves as the victims of election-year grandstanding, easy targets for a president looking for a wedge issue to galvanize the voters. ''It's saying, 'We think so little of you that we are willing to amend the Constitution to put you in your place,''' said Matt Foreman, executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. ''It's hard to explain the visceral feeling.''
 Many Americans reside in the ambivalent middle on these issues -- opposed to gay marriage, for example, but more divided on a constitutional amendment. Some Democratic strategists assert that many voters are even uncomfortable with these issues being debated in a political campaign. 
 ''The important question is, 'Are Americans ready to wage a pitched political battle over culture?''' said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster who also works for the Human Rights Campaign, a gay rights group. ''The answer is, no, they're not. Not anymore than they were in 1992 when Pat Buchanan called them to arms and they said, 'Hell, no.''' 
 But the terms of the debate are often set by the activists on both sides. As a result, candidates are now forced to take a stand on the nature of marriage, the values that unite Americans, how much change the society can or should accept. President Bush's endorsement last week of a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage pushed the issue into the presidential campaign. Senator John Kerry and his principal rival for the Democratic nomination, Senator John Edwards, declared that they opposed gay marriage, but would not amend the Constitution to ban it.
 The long-simmering debate over abortion will come to the president's doorstep in April when abortion rights groups, enraged over the administration's aggressive defense of the so-called partial-birth law, are planning a huge march on Washington. And the future of the federal courts -- especially the Supreme Court, given that the next president may be able to appoint two or three justices -- is increasingly seen as another front in the culture war. 
 ''People no longer believe the courts are evenhanded,'' Mr. Novak said. 
 The power of the gay marriage issue was reflected by a new poll by the Pew Research Center, which found that 34 percent of voters said they would not support a candidate who favors gay marriage, even if they agreed with the candidate on most other issues. By contrast, only 6 percent said they could not back a candidate who opposes gay marriage.
 Still, Andrew Kohut, director of the Pew Center, argued that Americans are in the midst of a striking change in their attitudes toward homosexuality and are far more tolerant of basic rights than they were 15 years ago. But there is a backlash at the idea of gay marriage, particularly among older Americans, he said.
 Many analysts note that the country has changed in other ways since the late 1980's and early 1990's, when cultural or wedge issues were in their heyday. Stan and Anna Greenberg, two Democratic pollsters, recently wrote in The American Prospect that ''while the cultural battle lines on abortion, homosexuality and guns remain,'' America is ''more diverse, more secular, better educated and more socially progressive'' than it was in 1988.
 But there are limits. Rhys H. Williams, professor of sociology at the University of Cincinnati, argues that the general tolerance of many Americans reaches those limits in the public square, when they are suddenly confronted with behavior -- like gay marriages in San Francisco, or Janet Jackson at the Super Bowl -- that they feel forces them to take a stand. 
 Robert Thompson, a professor of popular culture at Syracuse University, agreed, noting that the Super Bowl is ''the one place where we still all feed from the same cultural trough.'' A show that would hardly have shocked ''the niche audience'' of MTV was profoundly upsetting to the broader public, he added. The fragmentation of the mass media and its audience explains why ''Sex and the City'' can be so popular, he added, yet such outrage occur over the Super Bowl.
 The outraged also have new tools today. The Internet has quickened the pace of protest. It helped conservatives angered by CBS's planned mini-series on Ronald Reagan spread the word rapidly. CBS executives eventually pulled the show from the network, relegating it to cable. 
 The political implications of a renewed culture war are complicated. Strategists in both parties said they still expect the campaign to revolve around the economy and national security. But they also expect this to be a close election in which success at turning out core supporters will be crucial. For Republicans, that means white evangelical Protestants, who as recently as 1988 divided fairly evenly along partisan lines, but are now nearly 2-to-1 Republican.
 In the 2000 election, Mr. Bush carried 59 percent of the people who said they attended religious services at least once a week; former Vice President Al Gore carried 39 percent. This is a constituency to whom traditional values are important, suggesting the Bush campaign will keep hitting those themes. Still, Mr. Bush has been careful to run as a ''compassionate conservative,'' and avoid the harshness that some analysts argued had backfired on the Republicans in 1992.
 The Democrats are also wrestling with the lessons of past culture wars.
 Anna Greenberg, in an interview, said Democrats are unlikely to underestimate the power of these issues, as they did in 1988, when Michael Dukakis, the Democratic nominee, was devastated by attacks on his patriotism, his commitment to fighting crime, his general values. But they are also aware, she said, that the Republicans could overplay their hand.
 Ms. Greenberg also took the long view, saying the country was changing so fast that ''it's really likely in 10 or 20 years that people won't understand what all the fuss was about.'' ''There's a whole generation of people growing up who just don't think about these issues in the same way,'' she said. 
 Dr. Land of the Southern Baptist Convention said he, too, takes the long view of the culture war, but to a different conclusion. ''We're in this for the long haul, and the people on the other side had best understand, this is not for dilettantes, not for weekend warriors. We've been at it 30 years now on abortion, and we're winning, and the other side knows we're winning.''

HEADLINE: Her Kind Of Piano: In Need Of Repair

BYLINE: By TINA KELLEY

DATELINE: YONKERS 

 BODY:
TONI VAN LOAN will admit to being good at a variety of things. In 11 years of driving a taxi in New York City, she was never once mugged. She knows her way around the underbelly of an old English sports car, the kind that can be mastered with a flashlight, a pair of Vise-Grip pliers and a screwdriver. She renovates her own homes and maintains seven cats, three ferrets and a bounteous bird feeding station, requiring 500 pounds of seed a year. And, she says, she is the Queen of the Steinway Upright, especially those of a certain age that need new innards.
 Of all the things she's good at, one job particularly engages her indomitable enthusiasm: ''to take an old, busted, really good grand piano and raise it from the dead and make it work.'' 
 There is at least one thing she will admit to being fair at. ''I'm not a terrific player,'' she said, acknowledging that she practices only five or six hours a week, mostly Brahms. But that still puts her ahead of many piano technicians, she said, who aren't as skilled. 
 ''It's very helpful in terms of showing people the piano,'' she said. ''Often, they don't play, and they need to hear you play the piano for them.''
 Ms. Van Loan, 56, runs the Victorian Piano, a restoration business, out of her home, a showroom and a shared workshop, all in Yonkers. She tumbled into her craft 32 years ago, after graduating with a master's degree from the Manhattan School of Music in 1972, into the throes of a recession and, shortly thereafter, a gas crisis. Instead of following her plan of teaching music, music theory and piano, she turned down the one decent job that presented itself, in Caribou, Me. 
 ''I said in all honesty, I'd rather drive a cab in Manhattan,'' she recalled. ''Rural is not really my shtick.'' She continued driving her taxi at night while working free as an apprentice to master tuners and restorers during the day. 
 She bought her first Steinway, the Mercedes of pianos, in 1980. ''It was salmon pink with gold sparkles -- a bar piano,'' she said. ''Someone had painted the stinking thing.'' When consulting with the Steinway Company about that piano's age, she learned that its tuner, a Harlem man, had just been mugged and had refused to work. Yes, she would be interested in replacing him.
 ''I became the Gospel Church Queen in Harlem in the 1980's,'' she said, referring to the number of church pianos she tuned. In 1982 she gave up driving the cab. 
 Soon, she also became the Steinway Upright Queen, as the company referred to her people who had uprights in need of restoring. (More specifically, her Web site, www.victorianpiano.com, calls her the ''double flange action'' queen, referring to a balky part used in Steinway uprights from 1870 to 1935.)
 Her home next door to the Hudson in northwest Yonkers resembles what the inside of a cuckoo clock might look like, with a variety of small rooms, staircases and landings, topped by what she calls the Action Shop, an attic that she finished off into a musical aerie. In it, she keeps the first piano she ever restored, her 1906 Hardman, as well as two workbenches, one bench for uprights, one for grands, where she repairs the actions -- the moving parts, keys, hammers and shafts -- of various vintage pianos. 
 Actions on old upright pianos were put together with hide glue, made of animal hide and horse hooves, which fails after 50 years or so, she explained. The hammers need to be replaced, and the keys need to be rebushed, a process in which she replaces the compressed felt to keep them tight in alignment. She and her shop assistant, Peter Twyne, also work in the basement, which has held up to 11 pianos. Her husband, Frank, manages the Web site. 
 Under a poster for ''The Maltese Falcon,'' in an alcove blocked off from the ferrets by plywood, is her Action Corral, a chop shop of sorts, where she keeps the keyboards and actions of pianos she has bought for parts, some of which are obsolete.
 To repair a piano's cracked sounding board, the large sheet of spruce that resonates with the music, Ms. Van Loan uses shims made out of old Steinway sounding boards, wood that has been presoaked in song. 
 Restoring a Steinway upright can cost $4,000 for 10 days of work, while work on a grand piano that also needs its case refinished can cost $15,000 to $18,000. Ms. Van Loan also sells pianos she has bought and restored, including some with sad histories -- the 1898 oak Knabe grand piano given away for the price of hoisting it out of a Park Slope brownstone, the badly burned 1905 Steinway grand, with a new lid, veneer and actions, just the original ivory, as the lid had been closed at the time of the fire, and the Steinway player piano, circa World War I, that she dismantled on a tiny platform, all that remained of the third floor of the house being demolished around it. 
 She speaks wistfully of ''the dark, crashy, mellow tone of a bygone era,'' and says old pianos have a rich sound new ones cannot approach. 
 Ms. Van Loan restored two pianos for Judith Ballan of White Plains, who has recommended her widely to people who need pianos restored or who are looking for a particular kind of piano. ''She's almost like a matching service,'' Ms. Ballan said.
 She appreciates that Ms. Van Loan never overloaded her with repairs.
 ''She'll say the bushings are a little crummy looking, but they've got two or three years left in them,'' Ms. Ballan said. ''She won't push you to do work she feels is unnecessary. She's very aware that she's spending other people's money.''
 She also likes hearing all Ms. Van Loan knows about a particular instrument.
 ''It's just so clear she's doing it for the love of it,'' she said. ''One of the great benefits of working with her, you learn so much about pianos. She can't stop herself from telling you everything there is to know about the particular style of piano you're going to get.''
 Ms. Van Loan still dreams about driving a cab about twice a month, she said, recalling her most famous fares: a quiet Mikhail Baryshnikov, a flirtatious former mayor, John V. Lindsay, and the actor Denzel Washington, who appeared smaller in person than on screen, she said.
 ''I used to know where every legal space in Manhattan was, and when it became legal,'' she said, adding that she should write a guide to such matters. ''I didn't get a single parking ticket in 21 years. I'm very good at parking.''

HEADLINE: China's Wealthy Live by a Creed: Hobbes and Darwin, Meet Marx

BYLINE: By YILU ZHAO

DATELINE: Beijing 

 BODY:
THE rich in China these days are moving into the villages of Napa Valley, Palm Springs, Long Beach, Upper East Side and Park Avenue, all in the suburbs of Beijing and Shanghai. When I grew up in Shanghai, places were called New China Road, Workers' New Village and People's Square. Now China's real estate tycoons have chosen American place names, and adorned what they build with Spanish arches, Greek columns and faux Roman sculptures. 
 But the settings themselves are not bucolic. The vast majority of these new single-family homes, which cost $800,000 on average, are huddled together in walled compounds with 24-hour security guards. The few rich who dare to live on their own in the countryside almost always become targets of burglars, who, in desperate moments, are willing to kill. 
 This is the dark side to China's new wealth: Envy, insecurity and social dislocation have come with the huge disparity between how the wealthy live and how the vast numbers of poor do. Clear signs of class division have emerged under a government that long claimed to have eliminated economic classes. 
 China still calls itself socialist, and in an odd sense it is. While the income structure has changed, much that was intended to underpin social order has not.
 The criminal justice system, for example, has remained draconian. When caught, burglars invariably receive lengthy sentences. But there is no shortage of burglars, and the reason is clear: 18 percent of Chinese live on less than $1 a day, according to the United Nations. The poor are visible on the edges of any metropolis, where slums of plywood apartments sometimes abut the Western-looking mansions. 
 The most recent measure by which social scientists judge the inequality of a country's income distribution indicates that China is more unequal, for example, than the United States, Japan, South Korea and India. In fact, inequality levels approach China's own level in the late 1940's, when the Communists, with the help of the poor, toppled the Nationalist government. 
 In 1980, when the turn toward a market economy started, China had one of the world's most even distributions of wealth. Certainly, China before 1980 was a land of material shortage. When I was a child in the 1970's and 80's, I can recall, every family, equally poor, collected ration coupons to get flour, rice, sugar, meat, eggs, cloth, cookies and cigarettes. Without coupons, money was largely useless. Today, huge Western-style supermarkets offer French wine and New Zealand cheese. 
 But an odd change has come about in some shoppers' minds. As members of China's business and political elite, they have come to believe that the world is a huge jungle of Darwinian competition, where connections and smarts mean everything, and quaint notions of fairness count for little.
 I noticed this attitude on my most recent trip to China from the United States, where I moved nine years ago. So I asked a relative who lives rather comfortably to explain. ''Is it fair that the household maids make 65 cents an hour while the well-connected real estate developers become millionaires or billionaires in just a few years?'' I asked. 
 He was caught off guard. After a few seconds of silence, he settled on an answer he had read in a popular magazine.
 ''Look at England, look at America,'' he said. ''The Industrial Revolution was very cruel. When the English capitalists needed land, sheep ate people.'' (Chinese history books use the phrase ''sheep ate people'' to describe what happened in the 19th century, when tenant farmers in Britain were thrown off their land to starve so that sheep could graze and produce wool for new mills.)
 ''Since England and America went through that pain, shouldn't we try to avoid the same pain, now that we have history as our guide?'' I asked.
 ''If we want to proceed to a full market economy, some people have to make sacrifices,'' my relative said solemnly. ''To get to where we want to get, we must go through the 'sheep eating people' stage too.''
 In other words, while most Chinese have privately dumped the economic prescriptions of Marx, two pillars of the way he saw the world have remained.
 First is the inexorable procession of history to a goal. The goal used to be the Communist utopia; now the destination is a market economy of material abundance.
 Second, just as before, the welfare of some people must be sacrificed so the community can march toward its destiny. Many well-to-do Chinese readily endorse those views, so long as neither they nor their relatives are placed on the altar of history. In the end, Marx is used to justify ignoring the pain of the poor.
 What the well-off have failed to read from history, however, is that extreme inequality tends to breed revolutions. Many of China's dynasties fell in peasant uprisings, and extreme inequality fed the Communist revolution.
 While the gross domestic product has grown at least 7 percent a year in the last decade, the income of the rich has grown much faster than that of the poor. Political and business elites are merging, as state factories are sold at cheap prices to managers who often have government ties. 
 Wu Jinglian, a senior economist with China's State Council Development Research Center, recently called this ''the abuse of power to create income,'' in an interview with People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, which was once just an official mouthpiece. A December article on the paper's Web site gave examples of China's politician-businessmen buying multimillion-dollar properties, for cash, in and around New York City and Los Angeles. 
 Meanwhile, as the Communist Party recruits successful businessmen as new members, blue-collar workers have lost their moral and social standing. Millions have lost their jobs, and older laid-off workers have been described in many publications as ''historical baggage.'' 
 Often, they are from the generation born just after the Communists took power in 1949.
 My mother is of that generation. Born in 1950, she never finished high school because Mao Zedong closed almost all schools during the Cultural Revolution, from 1966 to 1976. She started work at age 16, at a textile factory, and stayed there until 1999, when the plant closed.
 Luckily, I was studying in the United States by then, and soon I began working and sending money home. My mother, unlike some of her colleagues with younger children, didn't have to take a 90-cent-an-hour job as a maid or milk deliverer. 
 It still puzzles my mother that she has become ''historical baggage.'' Weren't her contemporaries the heroes of China's rapid industrialization? Sometimes she notes that she is the unluckiest of three women -- my grandmother, herself and me. My grandmother, a daughter of a department store owner in pre-Communist China, went to private schools. I thrived in China's public schools during the economic reform. 
 The voices of my mother's generation are seldom heard today, because the government puts a lid on news coverage of the layoffs. A mostly compliant press is another holdover from the old days. 
 Sun Liping, a sociology professor at Tsinghua University in Beijing, is one of the few scholars who openly talk about them. ''They are not 'historical baggage,''' he said of the unemployed. ''The wealth of the Communist country, the assets of the state factories, were created by the blue-collar workers.'' 
 He said the reason that the unemployed are not yet despondent is that ''they have put their hopes in their children.''
 ''So long as their children have a chance to get a good education, they won't completely despair,'' he said. 
 Here in Beijing, I rode in the cab of a middle-aged driver who works 14 to 15 hours a day, seven days a week, to make $350 a month. ''My daughter is bright,'' he beamed. ''She is a college freshman studying interior design. She is our family's hope. When she finishes college, I'll quit this job.''
 China's leaders have vowed to reduce income disparity, and the press has been eager to cast them as advocates for the poor, much as it once described leaders as exemplars of the proletariat. But they face daunting tasks. They need to build a social safety net and basic medical care with tax revenue equaling 17 percent of the country's G.D.P., according to Anbound Group, a Beijing-based consulting firm. (According to the World Bank, United States tax revenue represents about a third of G.D.P., in a much larger economy.) 
 There are other ways in which the oddly mixed and cynical legacy of Chinese Marxism presents difficulties for anyone who would try to redistribute wealth. The reform era began with concepts like ''truth,'' ''kindness'' and ''beauty'' already devalued; in the Maoist period, people learned to scoff at such notions. For a few decades, Communist ideals like saving humanity from capitalist oppression had displaced Confucian teachings like respecting the elderly. That left a moral vacuum when Communism's grip loosened, and nothing has yet emerged to fill it.
 ''A lot of people simply don't believe that things like truth, selflessness and altruism exist,'' said a government researcher in Beijing. ''We have a very cynical population.''

To the Editor:
 Bob Herbert's defense of the average worker (column, Feb. 23), while noble, is based on the myth of the American dream.
 Who is the average American worker? Large swaths of the population have worked for years at the minimum wage. In addition, they struggle in the health care bracket between Medicaid and insurance. 
 The outrage at the economic stresses on the previously comfortable middle class is justified, but it sounds hollow, I'm sure, to those who have no hope of reaching middle class.
 Even in high-quality jobs, employees work more hours for fewer benefits and less paid vacation than in comparably wealthy countries like Britain, France and Germany. 
 Purveyors of the American dream should consider that years of complacency among trade unions and legislators in the face of longer working hours and rising health costs are also responsible for the instability the middle classes are facing today.

HEADLINE: POLITICS UP, CONFIDENCE DOWN

BYLINE: By David Leonhardt

 BODY:
Through all of the turmoil of the last three years -- recession, 9/11, two wars -- Americans had shown an impressive sanguinity. Polls showed that people remained more optimistic about the country and the economy than they did throughout much of the 1970's, 80's and early 90's. The glow of the 90's boom did not wear off. 
 But now, people seem to be getting worried that the long jobs slump of the last three years may be the new reality. Although the Commerce Department said Friday that the economy had grown 4.1 percent in the final three months of last year, job growth remained tepid through the early part of 2004. Households appear to have noticed: consumer confidence fell sharply in February, the University of Michigan reported Friday. 
 In part, the decline might reflect the harsh criticism of President Bush -- and the state of the economy -- in the Democrats' primary battles, economists said. The press has also recently paid much attention to the outsourcing of American jobs to other countries, a topic sure to heighten anxiety.
 But this week will offer some hint as to whether pessimism is likely to continue surging. On Friday, the Labor Department will announce how many jobs the economy created in February. David Leonhardt

HEADLINE: Long Flights And Thrombosis

BYLINE: By SUSAN GILBERT. 
SUSAN GILBERT writes frequently for The Times about science.

 BODY:
THREE days after flying from Pittsburgh to Charleston, S.C., for spring break six years ago, Cynthia Kos, then 19, began having crushing pains in her chest and left leg. The leg swelled and turned purple. Because she was a fit collegiate volleyball player who rarely got sick, she could not imagine what was happening.
 Doctors diagnosed deep-vein thrombosis, a potentially serious condition in which blood clots form in the leg or pelvic veins. Flying on an airplane for several hours can cause it, doctors say. 
 The risk is greatest for people with health conditions that promote clotting, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and blood-clotting disorders, according to the World Health Organization. Being pregnant, having recently had surgery, taking hormonal medication (either birth control pills or menopausal hormone therapy), or being over age 40 also increases the odds, the organization states. It was not until she was treated for deep-vein thrombosis that Ms. Kos learned that she had a rare clotting disorder. 
 But doctors say that many air travelers who develop deep-vein thrombosis, or D.V.T., either did not have medical risk factors or, like Ms. Kos, did not think they had any.
 ''For most of my patients, it came out of the blue,'' said Dr. Samuel Z. Goldhaber, director of the Venous Thromboembolism Research Group at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. 
 At least 200 people around the world have had D.V.T. following air travel in the last decade, according to a report in the journal Aviation, Space, and Environmental Medicine last May. 

Long Hours Aloft
 The longer the flight the greater the risk, experts say. The precise risk from flying is unknown, but a study published in December in the Lancet, a medical journal, found that the incidence was 1 percent among passengers at low or moderate risk of blood clots who had flown at least 10 hours over a period of six weeks. 
 The longest nonstop flight is an 18 1/2-hour trip from Singapore to Los Angeles introduced this month by Singapore Airlines. The carrier plans to start 18-hour nonstop service between Singapore and New York this summer. 
 Sitting for many hours without getting up and moving around makes blood flow in the legs slow down, increasing the tendency of the sticky components in the blood to clump together and form clots in the leg veins. Most of the clots dissolve harmlessly without treatment, but they can be fatal if they break away and lodge in the pulmonary arteries. 
 Though the condition is sometimes called economy class syndrome, it isn't restricted to the air travelers with the least legroom. 
 ''It occurs in first class and business class, too, but less frequently because there are fewer seats,'' Dr. Goldhaber said.
 Whether sitting for long car or train rides also promotes the condition is unknown, but Dr. Goldhaber said that there appears to be something about flying that heightens the risk. ''It could be the low air pressure or oxygen levels, or the fact that you can stretch out more in a car or a train,'' he said. 
 The World Health Organization has a large study under way to look at this and other questions about D.V.T. and air travel. Doctors have known for decades that flying can promote blood clots, but the issue came to worldwide attention in the fall of 2000, when Emma Christoffersen, a 28-year-old Australian, collapsed at Heathrow Airport in London and then died shortly after a 20-hour flight from Melbourne. A blood clot had formed in a leg or pelvic vein and migrated to a lung.
 Since then, medical groups have joined forces with the airline industry to educate travelers on how to prevent the problem. 
 Next month people in airports are likely to see posters and hear public service announcements on the subject as part of Deep Vein Thrombosis Awareness Month, sponsored by the Coalition to Prevent Deep-Vein Thrombosis, an organization formed by several medical and patient-advocacy groups. The coalition has a Web site, www.preventdvt.org, with information on how to prevent the condition and recognize symptoms, as well as exercises you can perform on the plane to reduce the risk. 

Prevention
 Even people with multiple risk factors can fly safely as long as they take precautions, said Dr. Franklin Michota, a coalition member who is head of hospital medicine at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. 
 The coalition recommends these measures for all passengers on flights of six or more hours: 
 Prevent dehydration by drinking plenty of water and little or no alcohol. Dehydration can promote blood clots by causing the blood to thicken, said Dr. Goldhaber, a co-chair of the coalition. 
 Wear loose-fitting clothes to avoid constricting blood vessels.
 Walk around the cabin when possible and do simple exercises in your seat to increase blood circulation. ''The best exercise is a foot press in which you move your feet up and down as if you're pumping the gas pedal,'' Dr. Michota said. 
 Over the last few years, several airlines have started showing videos and putting cards in the seat bags that show exercises to help prevent D.V.T. 
 ''When people choose a movie to watch, they also see a short video of exercises they can do in their seats,'' said James Boyd, a spokesman for Singapore Airlines. Dr. Michota said that such measures are fine for young, healthy travelers, but are not sufficient for those at elevated risk of D.V.T. 

Risk Factors
 For people at moderate risk, including those with a history of the disorder or who are over 60, the coalition recommends wearing compression stockings, which are tight stockings that help increase blood circulation from the legs to the heart by putting pressure on the legs. Some kinds of compression stockings are sold over-the-counter in drugstores, and they might work fine, but the only ones that are proven effective in preventing D.V.T. are available by prescription, Dr. Michota said. 
 The coalition advises people at high risk, including those with heart disease, cancer or clotting disorders, or who have recently had surgery, to talk with their doctors about taking medicine to prevent blood clots before flying. Several herbal preparations claim to prevent D.V.T., but Dr. Michota and other doctors say that there is little or no scientific evidence that they work. 
 Blood clots are most likely to form within two weeks of a flight, doctors say. Symptoms include intermittent pain in a leg that feels like a cramp, redness or swelling in a calf, shortness of breath and chest pain. 
 But preventive measures make D.V.T. unlikely for travelers, Dr. Michota said. Cynthia Kos, who now takes anticlotting medication, has flown numerous times since her incident several years ago and is happy to report, ''I've had no problems.''

HEADLINE: More Are Betting The Franchise

BYLINE: By SHERYL NANCE-NASH

 BODY:
THE franchise market on Long Island is hotter than a steamy cup of joe from Dunkin' Donuts.
 ''In the last two years there has been at least a 50 percent increase in the number of people buying franchises,'' said Harold Kestenbaum, a lawyer with Farrell Fritz in Uniondale, who has nearly 30 years of experience in franchise law. ''There's a franchising boom on Long Island.'' 
 David Kaufmann, a lawyer whose New York City firm represents many large franchisors, estimated that 40 percent of all retail sales on Long Island are from franchises. Not only is Long Island home to icons like 7-Eleven, KFC and McDonalds, but there's growth in newer franchises like the submarine sandwich eatery Quiznos, Cold Stone Creamery, Panera Bread and Curves, a women's gym chain. Service-oriented franchise businesses like window cleaning, maid service, remodeling and handyman services are also catching on, said Maddie Beagelman, president of Frannet Long Island, a franchise consulting firm in Jericho. 
 Long Island mirrors the national growth in franchising, Mr. Kaufmann said. The country's 320,000 franchised businesses in 75 industries account for some $1 trillion in annual retail sales. About one in 12 retail businesses is franchised, according to the International Franchise Association, an industry group in Washington. 
 ''Franchising is thriving in part because of the economic downturn,'' Ms. Beagelman said. ''When the economy is good, we're slow.'' She said her business was up 35 percent in 2003.
 Mr. Kestenbaum said this apparent inversion of economic reality is because bankruptcies, mergers, downsizing and layoffs sour people on the corporate world. ''People who have been laid off ask themselves why they should go back and work for someone else,'' Mr. Kestenbaum said, adding that severance packages are often used as start-up capital. ''They want to control their own destiny.''
 Also in the mix are early retirees deciding that they're not ready to slow down after all, baby boomers with an entrepreneurial dream and women hitting the glass ceiling. 
 Vita Zorbo wasn't necessarily bucking to be an entrepreneur. She had worked 20 years with an energy company as an investor relations manager and corporate secretary as the company went through bankruptcy and Chapter 11 restructuring, as it shut its New York City offices and forced her to commute to New Jersey from her Baldwin home. Then in 2002 she was let go.
 The job hunt proved horrendous. ''I was always either over- or under-qualified for a job, or the salary was way under my price,'' she said. With time on her hands, she helped her niece explore a franchise opportunity last summer. In September her niece opened a Ladies Workout Express, an exercise franchise that now has more than 40 locations on the Island. Ms. Zorbo was intrigued. Her niece was doing so well, so fast, that Ms. Zorbo opened her own branch in West Hempstead in November.
 ''I'm not commuting, I have more time for my family,'' said Ms. Zorbo, 40. ''Good things do happen.'' 
 Leslie Valentine lost her job of nearly 15 years at Morgan Stanley on her 40th birthday in 2002. After 9/11, the marketing manager and Woodmere resident had to commute temporarily to the firm's New Jersey office and then to temporary offices in Midtown. In 2002 she was scheduled to move to Westchester. It had all become tiresome.
 ''I heard rumors of layoffs and there was a part of me that was hoping for it,'' Ms. Valentine said.
 After being home awhile, she realized she didn't miss the corporate world. ''I had a little money in my pocket from my package and the thought of being self-employed appealed to me,'' she said.
 Ms. Valentine said she was attracted to the franchising concept because it offered support. ''I liked the fact that I wouldn't have to teach myself every aspect of the business,'' said Ms. Valentine, who plans to open a Rita's Frozen Ices franchise in Oceanside in March. ''Their expertise is worth paying for.''
 Franchising can be a way to be in business for yourself without going it alone. The franchisor has a proven way of doing business that theoretically increases your probability of success. It is a big brother of sorts who provides a road map, a step-by-step manual of everything needed to run the franchise. While the costs involved vary with the type of business, basic franchise fees typically range from $30,000 to $60,000, Ms. Beagelman said. 
 From the business owner's perspective, franchising is a cheaper way to expand. The cost and risk are split with the franchisee. 
 But let the buyer beware: franchises, even involving established, successful companies, are not risk-free investments. There could be oversaturation in some categories, and in many respects the franchisee is at the mercy of the parent company.
 ''You agree to run the franchisor's business according to their policies and procedures,'' said Susan Kezios, president of the American Franchise Association. ''A change could mean you need new signage, or company colors, or other changes to facilities that could be costly.'' 
 In 2002, John Pierro of Holbrook started a company, SmartWall, which makes residential storage systems for basements, garages and laundry rooms. Mr. Pierro has only three employees at his Yaphank office, but he says his business has done so well that he's working with a consultant to develop his business into a franchisor. ''I'm excited about the opportunity for my business to expand and to teach this business to others,'' he said. ''Everybody wins.''
 Also in 2002, Roasty's Original Roast Beef opened in Merrick, and the owners, the brothers-in-law Bruce Golden and Steven Bogart, also are in the process of franchising. Mr. Golden, who lives in Hewlett, said that he and Mr. Bogart, of Roslyn, didn't envision franchising, but that from Day 1 people have sought them out.
 ''This move is driven by demand,'' he said. ''I have been asked by a lot of former business executives about franchising. They want their own business.'' Already they have a franchisee who has signed a lease for a Roasty's in Oceanside.

HEADLINE: Better Hide That Red Sox Cap Now That A-Rod Is Back in Town

BYLINE: By SETH KUGEL

 BODY:
Things can get heated in Washington Heights when the Yankees battle the Boston Red Sox, who feature Dominican superstars like the local favorite Manny Ramirez and the pitching ace Pedro Martinez. The neighborhood has long had a subversive streak, with a vocal Dominican-American minority forming a fifth column of Red Sox Nation deep in enemy territory.
 The arrival of Dominican-American megastar Alex Rodriguez, however, may test their Red Sox loyalty. A-Rod has only tenuous Washington Heights connections -- he was born there, but moved to Florida as a preschooler -- but that may be enough. The Spanish-language newspaper El Diario declared: ''Washington Heights Waits for the Idol,'' described the neighborhood as ''Alex's Barrio,'' and predicted that the building where he lived will become a destination for baseball pilgrims. 
 Rodriguez, who will play third base for the Yanks, does put up the numbers that create pilgrims. He was the American League's most valuable player last year, and has led the league in homers each of the last three seasons. In interviews, many local Yankees fans claimed they had been devoted Rodriguez fans forever, even as he played out of the limelight for the struggling Texas Rangers. 
 But they are not all telling the truth, according to Andres Zorrilla, the owner of Audubon Flats Fixed, a tire-repair shop half a block from A-Rod's first home on West 183rd Street. ''Now that he has gone to the Yankees, his fame has expanded,'' Mr. Zorrilla said. ''Before, Manny Ramirez was much more frequently mentioned.''
 You practically trip over Ramirez's high school classmates here, while people with connections to A-Rod are rare. ''He doesn't even remember living here too well,'' said Eduardo Gutierrez, a friend of the Rodriguez family.
 Still, it is Rodriguez's time, and many have found reasons to love both him and his work ethic. ''People adore A-Rod because Manny has a very bad attitude,'' said Juan Carlos Ramirez, a former baseball player at George Washington High School, Ramirez's alma mater.
 On Thursday, even Mayor Bloomberg got into the act, declaring Rodriguez the greatest economic development project ever to come out of Washington Heights.
 Will Red Sox cap sightings become more rare? Tomas Pena King, who delivers cigarettes to local bodegas, is one Boston fan who insists he will not be swayed. But Raphael Alvarez, who owns the Alvarez Tax Preparation Center on Audubon Avenue, said: ''A-Rod is going to be part of New York. He's going to be part of us. All Dominicans are proud to have someone like him. He's the best of the best.'' SETH KUGEL

HEADLINE: The Results Are in and the Winner Is . . . or Maybe Not

BYLINE: By ADAM COHEN

DATELINE: CHEROKEE COUNTY, Ga. 

 BODY:
Rob Behler isn't saying Max Cleland's Senate seat was stolen by rigged electronic voting machines, but he insists it could have been. Mr. Behler, who helped prepare Georgia's machines for the 2002 election, says secret computer codes were installed late in the process. Votes ''could have been manipulated,'' he says, and the election thrown to the Republican, Saxby Chambliss.
 Charlie Matulka, who lost to Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska the same year, does not trust the results in his election. Most of the votes were cast on paper ballots that were scanned into computerized vote-counting machines, which happen to have been manufactured by a company Mr. Hagel used to run. Mr. Matulka, suspicious of Senator Hagel's ties to the voting machine company, demanded a hand recount of the paper ballots. Nebraska law did not allow it, he was informed. ''This is the stealing of our democracy,'' he says. 
 Defeated candidates who think they were robbed are nothing new in American politics. But modern technology is creating a whole new generation of conspiracy theories -- easy to imagine and, unless we're careful, impossible to disprove. The nation is rushing to adopt electronic voting, but there is a disturbing amount of evidence that, at least in its current form, it is overly vulnerable to electoral mischief.
 Among the growing ranks of electronic-voting skeptics, Mr. Cleland's loss in 2002 and Mr. Hagel's wins in 1996 and 2002 have taken on mythic status. There is no evidence the wrong man is in the Senate today. The problem is, there is no way to prove the right man was elected, either. 
 Mr. Cleland's loss was, some say, a surprise. He was said to be leading in the polls before Election Day, but ended up losing decisively. Many political observers attribute his loss to President Bush's strong support for Mr. Chambliss, and attack ads picturing Senator Cleland with Osama bin Laden. But others are suspicious of the new voting machines in Georgia.
 In the summer of 2002, Mr. Behler was in a Georgia warehouse, helping prepare thousands of machines for the coming election. He says there were constant problems with the hardware and software, and growing pressure as the election drew near.
 Three times while he was there, he says, Diebold, the voting machine manufacturer, sent ''patches'' -- updates in the programming -- to be installed on the machines. Later, he says, he heard of a fourth. Bev Harris, an electronic-voting critic who runs www.blackboxvoting.org and is a controversial figure in the elections world, says there were eight. Diebold and Georgia insist there was only one patch, which Diebold says was added ''prior to the election, but not last minute.''
 The Georgia machines do not produce a paper record voters can inspect to ensure a vote was correctly cast. But Georgia says they go through three testing levels, including an outside body that certifies the software. When patches are added late, however, there may not be time for certifying them. Georgia officials concede the one patch they admit to was given only a partial examination by an outside certifying body.
 Ms. Harris argues the patches could have turned Cleland votes into Chambliss votes. ''You can put in dynamic files that self-destruct after the election,'' she says. ''There would be no evidence.''
 A final piece of the conspiracy theory is that Diebold's chief executive is an active Republican fund-raiser. It was probably inevitable that given all the elements -- late changes, an end run around the vetting process, a manufacturer with political ties, and a surprising outcome -- there would be suspicions about the results.
 Some of the same factors were present in Nebraska. In his primary race in 1996, Mr. Hagel, who had lived in Virginia for 20 years, beat the state attorney general by nearly two to one. In the general election, he defeated the governor, who had been elected two years earlier in a landslide. In 2002, against Mr. Matulka, he won more than 80 percent of the vote.
 What gets conspiracy theorists excited is not just Mr. Hagel's prodigious wins, but his job before jumping into the 1996 race: heading American Information Systems, the manufacturer of the machines that count 85 percent of Nebraska's votes. There is a much simpler explanation than electronic sabotage. Mr. Hagel's campaign in 1996 was widely regarded as stronger than his rivals' campaigns. His next opponent, Mr. Matulka, an unemployed construction worker, was a weak candidate. But when critics like Ms. Harris argue these machines could have been programmed to miscount, the state should be able to come back with irrefutable evidence they were not.
 A healthy democracy must avoid even the appearance of corruption. The Georgia and Nebraska elections fail this test. Once voting software is certified, it should not be changed -- not eight times, not once. A backup voting method should be available, so if electronic machines fail or are compromised shortly before an election, they can be dropped.
 Votes must be counted by people universally perceived as impartial. States should not buy machines from companies that have ties to political parties, and recent company executives should not be running for elections on those machines. 
 And every voter should see a paper receipt. This ''voter-verified paper trail'' should be retained, and made available for recounts -- a low-tech check on the reliability of electronic voting. Most Americans would not do business with a bank that refused to provide written statements or A.T.M. receipts. We should be no less demanding at the polls. 
 After all, as Tom Stoppard has observed, ''It's not the voting that's democracy, it's the counting.''

HEADLINE: San Francisco Toasts Gay Weddings

BYLINE: By DEAN E. MURPHY

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO 

 BODY:
GOV. ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER of California has characterized the parade of same-sex weddings in San Francisco as ''an imminent risk to civil order.'' The tourism committee at the Golden Gate Business Association in San Francisco, on the other hand, couldn't be more delighted.
 The association, which represents gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender businesspeople, has been worrying for some time that San Francisco was resting on its laurels as a gay tourist destination. A little civil disobedience involving several thousand gay and lesbian couples was just the kick-start the city needed.
 ''It feels like a revolution, like there is some sort of secession happening here,'' said Anna Joy Springer, a creative-writing teacher from San Diego who drove eight hours overnight with her partner, Ali Liebegott, to marry here. ''The fight is part of our love.'' 
 At gaytravelnews.com, editors were rewriting the Web site's feature ''10 Great Reasons to Visit San Francisco,'' to add No.11: marriage. Several hotels have begun offering gay honeymoon packages, bakeries specializing in wedding cakes are struggling to keep up with demand, and last weekend the city witnessed one of the biggest wedding receptions anyone here could remember, when 1,800 people (including 600 newlyweds) celebrated the marriage of the lesbian advocates Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon.
 ''We've seen a 20 percent bump up in business,'' said Bill Boeddiker, who with his partner, Bob O'Halloran, owns the Parker Guest House, a popular inn in the Castro District that markets itself as a romantic getaway for gays and lesbians. ''We have someone flying in tomorrow night from New York City. They called us yesterday and asked specifically about getting married.''
 Tourism officials said the same-sex marriages came too fast and unexpectedly for statistics to be collected on the economic consequences. The county assessor and recorder, Mabel S. Teng, has also had difficulty keeping up with the numbers. But her office reported that while most of the weddings, at least in the early going, involved couples living in the San Francisco Bay area, there were licenses issued to visitors from as far away as Britain and Thailand.
 ''It is a brave new world in a lot of ways,'' said Laurie Armstrong, vice president for public relations at the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau. ''It has certainly brought some new tourism in, but it is hard to track. We just can't get people to call up hotels and say, 'Hi, I am gay and I want a room.'''
 Over the past couple of years, the Golden Gate Business Association has held countless meetings with officials from the visitors bureau and City Hall to devise a more aggressive approach to promoting San Francisco's gayness around the world.
 Gay and lesbian links were added to the visitors bureau Web site, which is www.sfvisitor.org. A new brochure aimed at gay and lesbian tourists was written and will be released in a few months. A broader advertising campaign, ''Come Out Here,'' is also in the works. 
 But money is tight, and the city is facing a multimillion-dollar budget deficit; it is unclear how the new effort will reach the vast but scattered gay audience outside San Francisco. Competition for the lucrative international gay travel dollar is fierce from places such as Sydney, Paris, London and Amsterdam, and since gay marriages became legal in parts of Canada, from Toronto. Even in the United States, cities like Philadelphia and Miami have chipped away at San Francisco's dominance. Massachusetts is likely to join the list, depending on the coming decision on gay marriage there.
 Then to the surprise of everyone, Gavin Newsom, the straight mayor with the television-personality wife, Kimberly Guilfoyle Newsom, did something that instantly transformed him into a gay hero in San Francisco: He opened City Hall to same-sex marriages just before Valentine's Day, thrusting San Francisco and its gay-friendly culture into the world spotlight and singlehandedly reclaiming the city's title as a center of the gay world.
 ''We consider this a major P.R. event in our effort to market San Francisco as a gay destination,'' said Peter Gerhauser, director of sales and marketing at the Renoir Hotel, one of several hotels that seek gay and lesbian customers. ''For our little group, which has been trying to find ideas and money to get the city started, this couldn't have been better timing.''
 Mr. Gerhauser quickly reworked the Renoir's ''gay honeymoon package,'' which until now was aimed at luring couples marrying in not-so-distant British Columbia. The revised pitch announces: ''Discover today's San Francisco, where same-sex marriages are just a way of life!''
 In addition to the standard boat cruise of San Francisco Bay, town-car airport transfer and bottle of champagne, the $750 three-day package for two includes a tour of the Castro District, the city's most vibrant gay community, with a guide, Trevor Hailey. Lunch is provided at the Firewood Cafe, a popular Castro meeting place.
 ''We estimate our gay business is 15 to 20 percent of our total business,'' said Mr. Gerhauser, a German who moved here seven years ago. ''But we think that can grow as people see how simple it is here, how normal it is, to live as gays individually or as couples. When I first came here, I was overwhelmed to see so many couples walking the streets and talking in the cafes and no discrimination and no one yelling at you.''
 Over all, the short-term benefits for tourism of the same-sex marriage spree have been spotty. Mr. Boeddiker at the Parker Guest House said the legal questions hanging over the licenses have prevented a full-blown wedding bonanza for hotels and restaurants. 
 Three times during the first week of the new same-sex marriage policy, judges were asked to ban the licenses, which almost everyone acknowledges violate the state's family code. But each time a judge refused, same-sex couples shook their heads in happy disbelief, the lines outside City Hall lengthened and reservations for hotels and restaurants spiked.
 ''We still don't get calls saying, 'Mom is coming out with me,''' Mr. Boeddiker said. ''It seems to me it is folks knowing it is a short opportunity, and they are not making it overly complicated.''
 Kimpton Hotels and Restaurants, a San Francisco-based company, reported an increase in parties of 10 or more at some of its restaurants, including Postrio, Kuleto's and Grand Cafe, so much so that the restaurants took to creating ''on-the-spot mini wedding cakes,'' said Andrew Freeman, the company's vice president for public relations.
 Kimpton is also betting that over the long term its hotels will benefit from the publicity surrounding the weddings. Four of the hotels -- Harbor Court, Juliana Hotel, Galleria Park and Hotel Triton -- rolled out Freedom to Honeymoon weekend specials, ranging from $149 to $199 a night, not including ''optional services'' such as wedding receptions and excursions to the wine country.
 ''Gays and lesbians are a very good group of people to work with,'' Mr. Freeman said. ''They have a high level of disposable income and they love to travel and love to dine out.''
 Thomas Roth, president of Community Marketing Inc., a gay research and strategic planning firm in San Francisco, said that a recent survey by the company of about 3,200 frequent travelers around the world who are gay or lesbian showed that 61 percent were in a committed relationship.
 In the same survey, 79 percent indicated that ''progressive social policies'' were important to them when choosing a vacation destination, while 93 percent said ''feeling welcome and secure'' was important.
 ''San Francisco has all of those great things going for it,'' Mr. Roth said.
 So far, two couples at Community Marketing have tied the knot. Mr. Roth held a reception for them and another couple, complete with engraved champagne flutes and a big wedding cake with six groomsmen planted on the top.
 ''This has really put San Francisco back on the gay map,'' Mr. Roth said. ''We sent out an announcement on the reception to 1,500 clients worldwide.''

HEADLINE: The A.M.T.: An Uninvited Guest of the Middle Class

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
WHO, me? Rich?
 F. Scott Fitzgerald may have gotten it wrong. In the eyes of the tax collector, at least, the rich are not so different from you and me.
 Some 2.6 million taxpayers this filing season will be caught in a tax net that was never intended for them, and many millions more will have to spend time or pay a tax professional to establish, through complex calculations, that they have no extra tax liability.
 The cause is the alternative minimum tax, which was inspired by a disclosure to Congress in 1969 that 155 wealthy Americans who earned at least $200,000 in 1966 paid no income tax. That led to the creation of a sort of parallel tax universe, intended to make sure that even the richest Americans with the most sophisticated tax advisers would pay something, no matter how cleverly they arranged their financial affairs. 
 Now, however, partly because the A.M.T. was not indexed for inflation, the decidedly nonrich are feeling the bite.
 ''It's getting the upper-middle-income people'' already, said Gary C. Pokrant, a tax principal at the accounting firm of Reznick Fedder & Silverman in Bethesda, Md. ''In coming years, it's going to get closer to the center of the middle class. 
 ''The world ends then,'' Mr. Pokrant predicted. ''People aren't going to tolerate that.''
 Taxpayers are supposed to calculate what they owe each way -- under regular rules and the A.M.T. -- and pay whichever amount is higher. The alternative tax will affect roughly twice as many taxpayers this filing season as it did two years ago, and it is negating a significant part of the relief provided by the 2003 tax cuts that have been heralded by the Bush administration.
 Despite cuts in regular tax rates in 2001 and 2003, the A.M.T. rates remained unchanged, so the gap between the regular rates and the alternative minimum rates has narrowed. The difference between the current top rate, 35 percent, and the top A.M.T. rate, 28 percent, is only seven percentage points, compared with a difference of 11.6 points before the 2001 law. 
 ''What I think is asininely stupid is that you have a system that gives with one hand and takes back with the other,'' said W. Val Oveson, who was the national taxpayer advocate at the Internal Revenue Service from 1998 to 2000.
 Daniel N. Shaviro, a tax law professor at New York University, said the administration had engaged in ''gamesmanship'' in relying on the alternative minimum tax to minimize revenue loss from its tax cuts.
 While devilishly complex to calculate, the tax is fairly straightforward in principle. Above certain income levels -- $58,000 for a joint return, $40,250 for singles -- taxpayers are denied the benefits of personal exemptions for dependents and of various regular deductions. These include major items like state and local income and property taxes, interest expenses on home equity loans (unless used for improvements) and some medical expenses.
 Tax preparers hear howls of protest when they tell clients they owe the tax. ''They just don't understand why, after paying real estate taxes and state and local income taxes, they have to add it back in to pay the alternative minimum tax,'' said Jim Solano, an accountant and sports agent in Villanova, Pa.
 In addition, some money that is not counted as income for regular taxes must be included when calculating the alternative tax. Notably, the difference, or spread, between the exercise price and the market price for incentive options is taxable income under the A.M.T. 
 Say an executive exercised an incentive option to buy 1,000 shares for $5 a share, but the stock is trading at $25 a share when she exercises the option. Under the alternative tax rules, she has $20,000 of income, known as the bargain element, even if the stock price subsequently tumbles. 
 Some taxpayers first hear of the A.M.T. when they receive a notice from the I.R.S. that they owe it -- instead of the regular taxes reported on their returns. 
 ''The high-tax states, like New York and California, are going to get hit the most,'' Mr. Shaviro said.
 Still, taxpayers who do not itemize deductions generally will not owe any A.M.T., and itemizers who expect to be subject to the A.M.T. this year can take steps -- apart from a decision not to have any more children -- to minimize the bite. 
 Some time-honored devices, like deferring income to a future year and accelerating deductible expenses to reduce regular taxes, will need to be reversed if you expect to be subject to the A.M.T.
 To minimize the possible damage, you may benefit from exercising incentive stock options early in the year, so you have more time in the same year to sell the stock if the price drops. That way, you can report a short-term capital loss to partly offset the bargain element realized in exercising the option. 
 You may also want to avoid a special type of municipal bond that finances so-called private activities like sports stadiums because the alternative tax considers income from such bonds as taxable. Some mutual fund sponsors, notably Fidelity Investments, now promote A.M.T.-free bond funds.
 Investors who pay their brokers wrap fees -- flat annual fees for a virtually unlimited number of trades -- may want to consider switching to commissions on individual transactions, Mr. Pokrant said. ''Wrap fees are a terrible idea from a tax standpoint,'' he said. The alternative tax does not allow deductions for investment expenses, but commissions are added to costs or subtracted from proceeds, thereby becoming part of a capital gain or loss.
 An A.M.T. liability may prompt eligible taxpayers to withdraw money from retirement accounts sooner than they would otherwise, because distributions are taxable as ordinary income, even if some of the account's growth is attributable to capital gains. So a taxpayer in the regular, 35 percent bracket may choose to take a retirement distribution when he is liable for the 28 percent alternative tax rate. 
 And if you have paid the alternative tax in preceding years but now owe regular taxes, you may be able to claim an A.M.T. credit under a sort of averaging provision. If you were previously liable for the alternative tax because you exercised incentive stock options, you may be able to claim the credit. But a lost deduction for state and local taxes is gone forever.
 SOME people may overlook this credit, particularly if they change accountants. Look for the cause and amount of the liability on a work sheet for previous returns, not on the returns themselves.
 Despite complaints from taxpayers and tax professionals that the A.M.T. is hitting a vast number of people for whom it was never intended, there seems little immediate prospect of repeal. Without receipts from the alternative tax, the government would face a huge loss of revenue. The Treasury Department projects that those receipts will total $17.9 billion this year. And unless tax law is changed again, some $106 billion is projected to be wrung from 31.6 million taxpayers, or 29.6 percent of the total, in 2010, the last year that the current laws are effective.
 Much more likely, specialists said, are temporary palliatives, like the 2001 measure that raised the amount of income not subject to the A.M.T. through 2004. The administration's budget this month proposed an extension through the 2005 tax year that could cut the number of projected payers to 3.8 million from 12.3 million.
 ''This is serious stuff,'' Mr. Pokrant said. ''They've got to do something.''

HEADLINE: A Frenchman Or a Jew?

BYLINE: By Fernanda Eberstadt. 
Fernanda Eberstadt is a novelist who lives in France. Her most recent book is ''The Furies.''

 BODY:
In a working-class neighborhood of the 20th arrondissement in Paris, on a rainy, lead-gray morning last month, the housing blocks looked like sodden cardboard. But inside Brigitte Stora's apartment was an explosion of scarlet, ocher and flame gold, of Israeli and North African textiles, of pottery and a brass menorah. Stora, an Algerian-born Sephardic Jew, is a slim, impish-looking woman in her early 40's with a mop of black hair. She was wearing baggy jeans that revealed a strip of designer-style Jockey shorts, and she sewed a ripped camisole as we talked. In the kitchen, her teenage daughter, home sick from school, cooked herself a plate of pasta. 
 A former Trotskyite who quit a career in journalism to raise her three children, Stora belonged for decades to a political movement devoted to the cause of equal rights for Arab immigrants. French Arabs were her friends and political allies, and the integrated neighborhood in which she chose to live reflected those commitments. In the last three and a half years, though, Stora's perspective has changed. Since the beginning of the second Palestinian intifada in September 2000 and the subsequent rise of Ariel Sharon to the premiership of Israel, France has suffered what is widely considered the worst epidemic of anti-Jewish violence since the end of the Second World War, much of it at the hands of young Muslims. According to S.O.S. Verite-Securite, an anti-Semitism watchdog organization, 147 Jewish institutions -- schools, synagogues, community centers, businesses -- have been attacked. There have been reported instances of rabbis being assaulted. Secondary schoolteachers, under pressure from Muslim students, have canceled classes on the Holocaust. On the last Saturday of January, during a concert attended by the wife of President Jacques Chirac, a Jewish singer called Shirel was heckled by a group of French North African youths, who shouted: ''Filthy Jew! Death to the Jews!''
 There are about 500,000 Jews in France -- the largest Jewish population after those in Israel and the United States. There is a reason Jews have come to France from places like Eastern Europe or North Africa: ever since the French emancipation of the Jews in 1791, the country has -- with infamous lapses -- provided an enviable model of equality, an enlightenment ideal, enshrined in the French Republic, according to which individual difference is subordinated to common citizenship. But today this ideal is threatened by a tide of ethnic harassment and challenged by a surge of religious pride and self-identification among France's Jews and Muslims alike.
 Although the frequency of anti-Jewish incidents is said to have abated somewhat in the past year (thanks in part to more vigilant policing), many French Jews remain frightened, angry and dispirited. In 2002, the number of French citizens emigrating to Israel more than doubled from the year before to over 2,000. Like many of the country's secular Jews, Stora finds herself reconsidering the venerable French assumption that she and her family must be French first and Jewish second. For a thoroughly assimilated Frenchwoman (her husband is a deputy mayor of Paris), it is no small turnabout in her self-conception.
 ''I've always loved our neighborhood, its mix of African, Arab, working-class French,'' she said. ''For years, we lived in what I now realize was an illusion of solidarity. In kindergarten, my son learned to cook African dishes; my daughter was taught Arabic calligraphy. Now that's finished. The young mothers picking up their children from preschool wear head scarves; teenagers born in France speak Arabic in the streets -- before, never. Their spirit of rejection is absolute.''
 Secular French Jews of Stora's generation have felt the impulse to return to their roots before. As Stora pointed out, she, like thousands of girls born around 1960, was named after the cinema sex kitten Brigitte Bardot, but for her own children she chose names from the Hebrew Bible. ''I suppose I felt the need for my own moorings,'' she said. Even so, her children have embraced a much stronger form of Jewish self-identification -- one that is all the more militant for finding itself besieged. ''Because of anti-Semitism,'' she said, ''my children feel more radically Jewish than I ever did. Their attachment to Israel has become absolutely primary.''
 At first, Stora was gratified to see her children drawn unselfconsciously to their Jewish identity. Her son asked for a bar mitzvah; her daughter wore a Star of David made of sequins to parties -- a gesture Stora said she could not have imagined making in her own adolescence. But her gratification has faded. ''Now,'' she said, ''my heart sinks when my children come home saying, 'Mama, it's hard being a Jew.' For them, it means a constant low-level barrage of hazing, blows. These days, my daughter hides her Star of David under her shirt.''
 Hanna, the teenage daughter, explained: ''If I wear it, my friends jump on me: 'Where do you think you're living? Take that thing off!' At school, it's cool to be anti-feuj ''- feuj means Jew in verlan, a popular street slang. ''Kids say, 'This pen doesn't work; it's feuj.' In the cafeteria, it's 'Why are you eating alone like a feuj?' It's just a way of kidding, but I find it hard to live with.''
 Stora said that when she complained to Hanna's teacher about the anti-Semitic remarks, the teacher was dismissive. ''Of course it's because of Sharon,'' Stora recalled the teacher saying. ''I'm surprised your daughter takes it so personally.''
The worsening of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has created painful rifts among French Jewish intellectuals, aggravating the relations between those who feel dutybound to condemn Israel's human rights abuses and those who maintain that support for Israel is a prime obligation of diaspora Jews, especially in a political climate rife with anti-Zionism. Even if they are critical of Sharon's leadership, many French Jews resist what the lawyer and activist Serge Klarsfeld has called the pressure to become ''political Marranos'' -- Jews called upon to renounce Israel much as Jews during the Spanish Inquisition were compelled to renounce their faith.
 In a widely condemned polemic that appeared on the French Muslim Web site Oumma.com, Tariq Ramadan, a well-known Swiss Muslim philosopher, accused a number of leading French Jewish intellectuals -- including the philosophers Bernard-Henri Levy and Alain Finkielkraut -- of having betrayed their commitment to the universal ideals of the French Republic for a narrow sectarianism. (Read: Zionism.) What shocked French readers most about Ramadan's essay was that he explicitly identified his targets as being Jewish (including, notably, one who wasn't) -- an argumentative tactic that until recently stood in flagrant violation of the Republican taboo against racial or ethnic profiling.
 Most European intellectuals insist on a distinction between even the fiercest criticism of Israel and an endorsement of anti-Semitism. Recently, however, this distinction has blurred. During demonstrations in May 2002 organized by France's mainstream antiracist organizations, protesters shouted anti-Semitic slogans and tried to attack a couple of passers-by whom they believed to be Jewish. Veteran leftists like Stora, who find themselves and their children confronting a new and very real anti-Semitism, feel abandoned by their former comrades. ''For 15 years,'' she said, ''I was a militant in the Communist Revolutionary League. We fought for the rights of women, homosexuals, immigrants. In the 80's, we were at the forefront of the antiracist movement.'' In 1990, she noted, after the desecration of a Jewish cemetery at Carpentras -- presumed to have been the act of European-born neo-Nazis -- 100,000 people marched in protest in Paris, with the Socialist president Francois Mitterand leading the way. Yet today, when synagogues are firebombed, she complained, the left is silent because the anti-Jewish violence is perceived as coming from radical Muslims, whose cause the left has adopted as its own.
 With bitter humor, Stora summed up the generational shift in the French left, from the anticlericalism of Zola's time to today's sympathy for Islamists: ''The father and grandfather devoured priests, and the sons demonstrate in favor of head scarves!''
The rise of anti-semitic incidents in France began with the outbreak of the second intifada, and ever since the violence has closely followed world events. On Oct. 3, 2000, not long after Ariel Sharon's controversial visit to the Temple Mount, a synagogue in the Parisian suburb of Villepinte was set on fire. Within weeks, four more synagogues, mainly around Paris, were firebombed, and 19 more attacks on Jewish schools, houses, businesses and other institutions were reported.
 There was a sharp spike in violence after Sept. 11 and then again during the Israeli Army's assault on the West Bank town of Jenin in April 2002, when the Ministry of the Interior reported 395 anti-Jewish incidents around France. In the spring of that year in Perpignan, the southern town where I live, fear gripped what had been a rather laid-back provincial Sephardic community: cement barricades were raised around the synagogue; policemen body-searched anyone seeking admission; congregants who once gathered in the street after services disappeared quickly down alleys, thrusting telltale skullcaps into their jacket pockets.
 At first, the Socialist French government was painfully slow to react. Prime Minister Lionel Jospin and his colleagues appeared unable or unwilling to acknowledge either the systemic discrimination faced by North African immigrants and their children or the plight of Jews who, for the first time since Vichy, were being persecuted for their religion. When Jospin visited the West Bank, Palestinian students pelted him with stones for his perceived lack of sympathy for their cause. Many French Jews, too, were devastated when Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine dismissed the anti-Semitic violence in France as ''hooliganism'' and when a public prosecutor described three arsonists who were convicted of burning a synagogue in Montpellier as ''petty delinquents.''
 All this has changed under the center-right government of Jacques Chirac, who was re-elected in 2002 on the strength of a far harsher view of ''delinquency.'' Nicolas Sarkozy, Chirac's ruthlessly energetic minister of the interior, has waged a ''zero tolerance'' war on hate crime while also taking steps to improve the position in French society of North African immigrants and their children -- creating an official Muslim council, for instance, and advocating affirmative action in government appointments.
 Chirac is a smooth showman for whom most Frenchmen profess at best a weary tolerance, but he has his moments. It was Chirac who, in 1995, insisted that the French bore a collective responsibility for the Vichy government's crimes against the Jews and Chirac who tried to press Britain and the United States into intervening further in the Bosnian slaughter. Last November, after the burning of a Jewish school in the Parisian suburb of Gagny, Chirac went on national television and declared that ''an attack against a French Jew is an attack against France.''
 Since then, the Chirac government has made the crackdown on anti-Semitism a top priority. It has taken a series of emergency steps, from tighter policing of Jewish sites to quicker investigation and prosecution of hate crimes to proposing a heightened focus on the Holocaust in the public school curriculum. In recent weeks, Prime Minister Jean-Pierre Raffarin has moved to block the broadcasts in France of Al-Manar, Hezbollah's television station, which shows anti-Semitic propaganda. But nothing has grabbed as much attention as the government's proposed ''anti-head-scarf'' law, which would ban the wearing of ''conspicuous'' religious signs in school. Joseph Sitruk, France's grand rabbi, has supported the head-scarf ban, and many French Jews own up to a guilty sense of relief at the reassertion of an official secularism -- from which French Jews historically have benefited. Younger Jews may feel more Jewish than their parents did, but even Brigitte Stora's daughter, Hanna, says she believes that a sequined Star of David is something you wear to parties, not to school.
 Thanks to tougher policing, the ministry of the interior reports that anti-Jewish acts in 2003 declined by 36 percent and anti-Semitic threats by 37 percent. But even as France struggles to vanquish its demons, French anti-Semitism is routinely seized upon by others -- by American conservatives, in and outside the Bush administration, eager to discredit a contentious ally; by world Jewish organizations and Israeli officials, eager to cast an ugly light on France's pro-Arab sympathies. Earlier this month, the Israeli minister for Jerusalem and diaspora affairs, Natan Sharansky, announced that contrary to official French estimates, anti-Semitic incidents in France had in fact doubled in 2003 and that if the French government didn't address the problem, it could expect a massive exodus of Jews to Israel.
 With so many firemen fanning the flames, it is all the more necessary to accurately identify the very real anti-Jewish hatred alive in contemporary Europe. Is the man who was reported to a watchdog group for refusing his employee a day off on Yom Kippur an anti-Semite or just a jerk? On the other hand, a lot of old-fashioned anti-Semites have managed to clothe a disreputable hatred in the raiments of ''the Palestinian cause.''
After leaving Brigitte Stora's apartment, I went to visit the philosopher Alain Finkielkraut at a cafe across from the Jardins du Luxembourg. A rumpled, bespectacled 54-year-old, Finkielkraut comes from France's well-established Eastern European Jewish bourgeoisie. In his 1981 book, ''The Imaginary Jew,'' he described his postwar upbringing as a child whose own relation to the long history of Jewish persecution was bookish, theoretical. But his engagement with anti-Semitism today is now anything but theoretical. He has loudly sounded the alarm about what he calls a new ''Islamo-progressive'' alliance, in which the political left tolerates an age-old form of racial hatred that it has legitimized by calling it anti-Zionism.
 ''The loathing of Israel today is so thick you could cut it with a knife,'' he said. ''There is a consistent Nazification of the Jewish state: the memory of the Holocaust is always turned against Jews. Antiracism has become the contemporary key to understanding the world. In post-nationalist Europe, it's the Jews now who are called racist in their stubborn adherence to a territorial sovereignty Europe has only just renounced and the Palestinians whom the left certifies as kosher. Of course, Sharon is an extraordinary alibi.''
 For European Jewry, anti-Semitism has the bitter taste of repetition. The school where Stora's children's classmates today declare themselves ''anti-feuj'' bears a plaque commemorating the Jewish schoolchildren who were rounded up there and deported to the death camps. Which is why, when Jewish-owned businesses are once again being sacked, some Jews wonder whether they're living in the 1930's.
 But some comparisons, however tempting, are not useful. Today, the people who shout ''Mort aux juifs!'' in concert halls and throw stones at Jewish school buses are not agents of the state. They are not on the verge of coming to positions of power. They are, for the most part, second-generation Maghrebi (North Africans from Morocco, Algeria or Tunisia), many of whom have grown up in the decaying housing projects of the city outskirts, or banlieues, and for whom the promise of the Republican integrationist ethic is belied by high rates of unemployment and institutional racism. Many are born-again Muslims, trying to reclaim a heritage that is thin because their parents were illiterate in Arabic and uninstructed in Islam. They feel despised and disenfranchised, jealous of what they regard as the luxury and influence of Jewish institutions.
 ''The Jews have everything; we have nothing'' is a complaint that I have heard often from French Muslims, many of whom say that a recent spate of anti-Muslim violence -- the vandalizing of mosques, the desecrations of tombs -- has not been addressed by the French government or news media (nor has the small and underreported core of assaults by Jewish extremists on Muslims and Jewish peace activists). ''There's a hierarchy of racism,'' Mouloud Aounit, secretary general of the antiracist movement M.R.A.P., said to me. ''If a synagogue is burned, the president and the prime minister hop on a plane to offer condolences. If a mosque is burned, nothing.'' Many French Muslims watch virulently anti-Semitic programs via satellite television, they surf Islamist Web sites that show Muslims being persecuted by non-Muslims in Bosnia, Chechnya, Palestine and Iraq and they glorify their own daily frustrations and failures by (in the current catch phrase) ''bringing the intifada home to the banlieue.''
Certainly, the story of anti-Arab discrimination in France is real and has become no easier since Sept. 11. Even French conservatives admit that their country's record on integrating the Maghrebi has been dismal. In Perpignan, I have seen bouncers at chic bars turn away young French North African men and women, and I have encountered landladies who with perfect impunity tell callers that, yes, the apartment's available, but they don't rent to Arabs. S.O.S. Racisme, an antiracist organization, discovered that a bank turned down a job applicant when his name was Raouf but offered him the job when he reapplied as Thierry. It's no wonder that many young French Maghrebi, tired of being second-class citizens, have opted for a more valorizing identity, immersing themselves in varieties of Islam ranging from the most white-bread Sunnism to the paranoid realms of fundamentalism.
 I asked every Muslim I met in the course of reporting this article what he or she felt about Jews -- and asked Jews what they felt about Muslims. Most of the Muslims I spoke with expressed revulsion at the anti-Semitism being drummed up by Islamist demagogues. Saida, a 40-year-old Algerian-born social worker who insisted on being referred to by only her first name, lives in a housing project adjoining Trappes, one of the more notoriously fundamentalist banlieues of Paris, where a synagogue burned to the ground in 2000. A ''modern'' Muslim, Saida doesn't eat pork but doesn't mind if her children do, celebrates both Christmas and the Muslim holidays and smokes but doesn't drink. She said that she was disgusted by the bigotry of the born-again Islamist vigilantes who have wreaked havoc on Trappes' Jewish community. She complained bitterly of being harangued ''by kids whose diapers you changed, who've only just got out of prison on a drug bust, and now their 10-year-old daughters are wearing head scarves.''
 Still, Saida testified to a residue of anti-Jewishness in popular Maghrebian culture, the belief that Jews are somehow ritually unclean: ''I've heard that some people think the word 'Jew''' -- juif -- ''comes from the Arabic for 'carrion''' -- djeefa. ''After a battle in which all the Jewish men were killed, Abraham told the women to sleep with the corpses, and that's how the Jewish people survived.''
 For Hajiba (who also insisted that her last name not be used), born in Morocco and raised in a housing project in Strasbourg, the current wave of anti-Jewish violence is best understood as the product not of old-country prejudice but of an imported fundamentalism whose arrival in France she herself witnessed. Well before the second intifada and the recent flurry of violent incidents on French soil, she said, fundamentalists transformed the way many French Muslims regarded Jews. A tall, majestic woman with huge eyes like black grapes and an air of intense drama, Hajiba described the changes that took place in her easygoing Strasbourg banlieue in the early 80's.
 ''After the Iranian revolution,'' she said, ''suddenly radical Islam arrived in France.'' Its growth was made possible by a legal loophole according to which foreign governments -- most notably Saudi Arabia's -- were able, through the medium of charitable foundations, to build their own mosques and appoint their own fundamentalist imams in France, a dispensation that is only just being questioned.
 This newly imported Wahhabi-style Islam contained a high-octane dosage of anti-Semitism. ''Until 1980, there was no talk of 'the Jews,''' Hajiba recalled. ''In Morocco, we had Jewish neighbors, although they didn't come to our house the way Christians did.'' It was the fundamentalists who started stirring up an anti-Jewish discourse in the banlieues. Hajiba added, however, that today, both sides, Muslim and Jew, are responsible for inflaming the problem.
On Jan. 17, some 7,000 people marched from the Place de la Republique to protest the newly proposed law banning head scarves from public schools. There were Muslim women wearing everything from head bandannas to full-length black robes. There was a phalanx of turbaned men, wearing the traditional shalwar kameez, from a Belgian Islamist party. Many of the marchers, who had learned about the event from postings on Muslim Web sites, were portraying the ban as a civil rights issue: green ribbons were pinned to chests in an echo of the AIDS ribbon; a poster proclaimed ''It's My Business What I Do With My Hair.''
 But this was not a typical civil rights demonstration, for it was led by a man who is considered to be France's most infamous Muslim anti-Semite: Mohamed Latreche, a Tunisian-born founder of the tiny Strasbourg-based Muslim Party of France. He stood in a flatbed truck, and he teased the television cameras: ''Come meet the real anti-Zionists.''
 Two days before, I had met Latreche at Association al-Ghadir, a Lebanese Shiite mosque in the Paris suburb of Montreuil that is linked with Hezbollah, a group Latreche likens to De Gaulle's Free French. Latreche is a glossy, high-spirited man who was sporting an embroidered silk shirt he had just had made by a tailor in Damascus. He was flanked by bodyguards, one of whom filmed our interview -- either as propaganda for the party or to make sure I didn't distort his words. (Latreche is once again facing the threat of legal action for hate speech.)
 Latreche represents the meeting point of radical Islam and the European far right: in February 2003, he traveled to Baghdad as a ''human shield'' with Herve Van Laethem, head of the extreme right-wing Belgian party Nation; he declares himself ''proud'' to have as a friend Serge Thion, a notorious Holocaust revisionist. Latreche's signature theme is the Jew as Nazi. ''Where's the difference between Zionism and Nazism?'' he demanded. ''Israel is a nation founded on the idea of racial superiority. They dare talk about Nazi concentration camps when they are doing the same thing to Palestinians. Bush, Sharon, Hitler, what's the difference?''
 When I asked if he believed Israel to be a U.S. proxy, Latreche laughed merrily. ''If only! It's America that's a proxy of Israel. You'll see. If another country comes along that's more powerful, Israel will drop you, just as it dropped Britain.'' Latreche is a professional provocateur who knows that saying Zionism is Nazism makes headlines. After the January march -- which was boycotted by every mainstream Muslim organization in France -- he garnered the front page of the national newspapers as well as a lead editorial in Le Monde denouncing his anti-Semitism.
 Latreche's ability to continue to translate infamy into influence will depend on how well France manages to resolve its Arab-Jewish conflict. For two centuries, France has embodied a Republican ideal of common citizenship, according to which ''difference'' is something you practice at home. French people don't flaunt the fact that their grandparents were Armenian or Portuguese. Now the old integrationist ethic is beginning to crumble, as it has already done in America, under the onslaught of identity politics.
 What strikes me, listening to French youths, is how many use the word ''French'' to describe someone other than themselves. Nasty, a hip-hop musician and Muslim who was born and raised in France (and whose real name is Mourad Saadi), told me that when he informs his friends that he couldn't care less if his future wife's a virgin, they retort, ''Stop playing the Francais.'' More startling, considering how long Jews have been part of the French establishment, was when Hanna, Stora's daughter, told me that in her school ''Jews stick with Jews and the French with the French.''
 The French state, once so confident in its fundamental assumptions, is undergoing a painful period of self-questioning. The conflict between French Maghrebi and French Jews, evoking the twin demons of colonialism and Vichy collaboration, strikes to the core.
 Yet France, for all these doubts, remains a society in which the government wields enormous power to shape public attitudes. ''I'm not interested in the socioeconomics behind anti-Semitism,'' Sammy Alain Ghozlan, an Algerian Jewish ex-cop who founded S.O.S. Verite-Securite, said. ''I'm interested in policing it.'' Sarkozy is cracking the whip, and France is seeing the results. ''Before, when Jewish kids were beaten up in class, they were the ones who got moved,'' he said. ''Now it's their assailants. In recent months, the violence has definitely calmed down.''
 Whether France has the will to negotiate a lasting peace between its Arabs and Jews remains to be seen. But how it chooses to adjudicate the claims of identity politics and those of the Republic is of crucial importance in a newly retribalized world.

HEADLINE: Making It, Israeli Style

BYLINE: By LESLIE CAMHI

 BODY:
AN aspiring priest, in flowing tribal robes, is sent by his Nigerian village on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. But when he lands at Ben-Gurion International Airport, the Israeli authorities immediately nab him as an illegal immigrant. A shady businessman bribes a guard to free him, then sends him to work cleaning high-rise apartments in Tel Aviv. 
 ''James's Journey to Jerusalem'' (opening at Film Forum in New York on Friday), Ra'anan Alexandrowicz's hilarious and poignant debut feature, explores the sacred and profane impulses that shape both Israeli society and its individuals. James (the charismatic Siyabonga Melongisi Shibe) is a quick learner; his transformation from hard-working, wide-eyed servant of God to canny entrepreneur is a biting (if affectionate) satire of a Zionist dream gone wildly awry in a land of traffic jams and shopping malls.
 ''I realized that my country has two existences,'' Mr. Alexandrowicz, 34, said on a recent visit to New York, ''this abstract existence, in the minds of so many people, and the very practical existence of a normal -- or almost normal -- country. In Judaism, we have an expression for this split between fantasy and reality. We call it 'the Jerusalem of above and the Jerusalem of below.' In that gap, I thought, begins a film.''
 Mr. Alexandrowicz was born and grew up in the latter Jerusalem, where he studied filmmaking. His documentary, ''The Inner Tour'' (2000), which followed a group of West Bank Palestinians on a three-day bus tour of Israel, was remarkable for its sensitive handling of emotions about to explode in a second intifada.
 What does it mean to make a film like ''James's Journey'' -- a send-up of Western materialism -- at a time when Israel's economy is crumbling?
 ''It means that this modern philosophy of grabbing whatever you can doesn't always get you the best results in the long run,'' Mr. Alexandrowicz said. ''Whoever you left behind will come knocking on your door.'' LESLIE CAMHI

HEADLINE: Jamaica Seeks to Build on AirTrain

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
THE AirTrain is running between Jamaica, Queens, and Kennedy International Airport, taking passengers from a railroad-subway connection to the passenger terminals in about 12 minutes. Various routes have been suggested for a rail link between Lower Manhattan and Jamaica that would enable travelers to go from meetings downtown to their flights without facing the often traffic-choked highways leading to the airport.
 Since the area is already a major hub for the Long Island Rail Road and has extensive subway and bus service as well, planners say the community, near the geographic center of Queens, would seem to be a likely spot to practice an urban version of what they call transit-related smart growth.
 ''With necessary and significant private, public or mixed investment in site acquisition and maintaining new and modernized infrastructure, downtown Jamaica could be successfully revived,'' according to a study issued last year by City University's Institute for Urban Systems.
 Because of its connection to the airport, the economic engine of Jamaica's resurgence was expected to be airlines and air travel related businesses, although real estate specialists caution that development should not be limited to transportation-related projects. But because of the economic problems of the airline industry, that part of the plan is likely to be delayed. 
 Still, some real estate executives say the Air-Train may give a short-term boost to retail businesses. ''With the coming of the J.F.K. AirTrain, we should see more retail activity and things like hotels and tablecloth restaurants,'' said Adelle Klein, a senior managing director at Sholom & Zuckerbrot, a commercial and industrial brokerage active in the area. ''And the 14-screen theater that opened not long ago has added more evening business.''
 Richard Maltz, chairman of Greiner-Maltz, a brokerage active in Queens, Brooklyn and Long Island, added: ''Jamaica is booming from a retail standpoint. There are stores all along Jamaica Avenue and 40 to 45 feet in on the side streets.''
 In the meantime, a major rezoning plan is moving forward that would establish a special zone covering all or part of roughly 40 blocks around the AirTrain terminal that would encourage the development of hotels, office buildings and residences. While the allowable size of buildings in the special zone would be increased, the size of structures in adjoining neighborhoods would be restricted to preserve local character.
 The special zone would be irregularly shaped area both north and south of the Air Train and the Long Island Rail Road. It would start a few blocks east of the Van Wyck Expressway and extend as far east as 169th Street. The zoning proposal, covering a 415-block area in and around Jamaica, much of it residential, which would be largely protected from further development, is part of a citywide rezoning process.
 Plans have been made by a local group, the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation, working with LCOR, a national developer, to build a 13-story building with approximately 400,000 square feet of office and retail space. The plan -- which awaits a signed tenant before moving forward -- is seen as the first step in what the planners envision as a 5-million-square-foot mixeduse airport village on the 10 blocks closest to the AirTrain terminal.
 This would be analogous to the ''transit villages'' that have been springing up near commuter rail stations in New Jersey and in Westchester and Fairfield Counties.
 The emergence of these transit villages reflects the ''smart growth'' ideas that have largely focused on the suburbs as a means of slowing endless sprawl by directing growth back into older municipalities with existing utilities, communications and mass transit. In New Jersey the advent of Midtown Direct train service has been credited with reviving fading downtown areas in northern part of the state by attracting people who want quick, carless access to New York and retailers catering to them.

Envisioning Jamaica
A Regional Center Tied to Mass Transit
 Eventually, the thinking in Jamaica goes, the airline industry will sort itself out, an anchor tenant will be found for Tower 1 of the JFK Corporate Square development -- the official name for the village -- and other projects will move forward.
 Already, the first market rate housing in 40 years is under construction in the downtown Jamaica area. And parking decks have been built and remodeled to provide badly needed off-street parking.
 ''The Regional Plan Association designated Jamaica as a regional center tied to Manhattan by mass transit,'' said F. Carlisle Towery, a former R.P.A. official who has been president of the Greater Jamaica Development Corporation, a local economic development group, since 1972.
 The R.P.A. is a private planning group whose recommendations have often come to pass, if at a glacial pace. In New Jersey, its suggestion to connect two neighboring rail lines--now known as the Montclair Connection -- was first advanced in the 1930's, but did not actually go into operation until 2002.
 Transit-related developments are becoming increasingly feasible because people are forsaking a punishing daily automotive commute in favor of rail transportation, said Robert Yaro, president of Regional Plan. ''Total rail transport in the region,'' he said, ''is up one-third in the past decade, which is why you are seeing signs of life in places like Jamaica and New Brunswick,'' the city in central New Jersey.
 He said the increased ridership was at least partly a result of $35 billion that has been invested in rail transport in the region since 1970. He said most of the investment had been in the rails and rolling stock, but included the renovation of Grand Central Terminal. ''In 1990 it was a slum,'' he said.
 Transit-related developments have three major virtues, Mr. Yaro said. They recycle abandoned or underutilized land. They lure people out of cars and onto the rails for their daily commutes. And they give local residents, often people with limited transportation options, a shot at jobs that are created.
 Jamaica was once an independent municipality and is one of the oldest in the region, having been established in 1650. The name is said to derive not from the island in the Caribbean but rather from the Carnarsie Indian word for beaver, ''jamecos.''
 Even in ancient times the area was a transportation hub, with Indians from western areas traveling along a trail that is roughly the route of Jamaica Avenue today to trade with eastern tribes. By colonial times, the path had been widened to accommodate horse-drawn carts, and by 1834 the Brooklyn and Jamaica Railroad company completed a line to the trading post in downtown Jamaica.
 Elevated passenger trains began operation in 1918 and, according to the CUNY study, ''triggered enormous commercial and residential growth.'' It said, ''By 1925 the section of Jamaica Avenue between 160th and 168th Street had the highest assessed valuation in the county.''
 But after World War II, single family homes were developed in vast numbers on Long Island, attracting families out of apartments, and shoppers found it easier to drive their cars to the growing suburban malls than contest the tight preautomobile streets of Jamaica to do their shopping.
 As a result, major department stores in Jamaica gradually moved away or went out of business and poorer families and newer immigrants replaced the departed suburbanites. ''Within one generation, Jamaica's downtown went from a thriving, bustling hub of banking, government, retail and commerce serving three counties to a neglected and distressed shopping district serving a much smaller trading area,'' Mr. Towery wrote in a transportation newsletter.
 Nevertheless, a lot of people pass through the area. Approximately 100,000 commuters use the Long Island Rail Road terminal in Jamaica each workday, according to the local development group, with 16,000 more using the Sutphin Boulevard subway station and another 37,000 using the Jamaica Center subway terminal at Parsons Boulevard. In addition, about 40 bus lines serve Jamaica, carrying customers from eastern and southern Queens and Nassau County.
 Those numbers will rise significantly as passengers and airport workers -- the Port Authority expects the total number to be 12.4 million a year -- arrive in Jamaica to get to their flights and jobs. Any direct connection to Lower Manhattan, which some people are calling the ''super shuttle,'' would add still more.
 The trick, development officials say, is to prevent Jamaica from becoming simply a transit hub, where commuters rush through on their way to jobs in Manhattan or to the airport. Some planners and real estate executives say a hotel near the AirTrain terminal should be a priority. ''Without a hotel, there is nowhere for people to meet,'' said Ms. Klein of Sholom & Zuckerbrot.
 There have been proposals for a 10-story, 250-room hotel over the AirTrain terminal, but with the heightened security concerns after Sept. 11, the project is not likely to go forward soon.
 Mr. Towery said air travelers are not the only beneficiaries of improved transportation. He said improvements in subway service in decades past were responsible for the decision to build a Social Security Regional Center in downtown Jamaica and for City University officials to build York College nearby. Both wanted to be in a location easily reached by mass transit.
 And those subway trains run both ways, he added. ''Businesses in Manhattan can access the labor living here,'' he said.
 It cost the Port Authority about $1.9 billion to build the AirTrain and the terminal building, and the money was well spent, according to Robert Paaswell, a principal author of the CUNY study, along with Harry Schwartz and Linda Stone Davidoff. ''Transit, in 99.9 percent of the cases, is a good investment, with an economic payoff,'' Professor Paaswell said.
 Unfortunately, he added, improved transit ''is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for growth.'' He said it might take further public investment to convince developers that underused former industrial sites close to the Long Island Rail Road are bargain-priced and ready for development.
 He said York College, which is a four-year college, will probably be an important factor in training residents for more skilled, higher-paying jobs at the airport and at places like the Food and Drug Administration building, which houses offices and laboratories and is on the York campus. ''The area needs a wider range of jobs, including white collar jobs,'' Professor Paaswell said. ''You want to have career ladder jobs, and York College is a part of that.''
 Developing an office complex in Jamaica will be a stretch, since the area has not attracted office users in the past, said Mr. Maltz, the broker. He noted that many of the larger developments in the area have been government related, like the Queens County civil and family courts and the F.D.A. and Social Security buildings.
 Seeking airline and airport-related tenants is seen as a good idea, but, he added, ''Unfortunately, the airline industry is not flourishing now and they have placed expansion plans on hold.''
 Development officials had hoped to sign up Jet Blue, a rapidly growing low-fare carrier, but Mr. Maltz said this seems unlikely. ''Jet Blue subleased some Con Ed space on Jamaica Avenue that is much less expensive than a new building,'' he said.

Dealing With Autos
Nonprofit Group Offers Parking
 Because many people still prefer to travel by car, the Jamaica development group, though a not-for-profit operation, has gotten into the parking business, acquiring some formerly city-owned garages and lots and building a 410-space garage convenient to the 180 units of market-rate housing under construction.
 Under Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, ''the city wanted to get out of the municipal parking business, so we took over two city garages and renovated them and took two city lots and improved them,'' Mr. Towery said. He said the group pays taxes to the city out of income from the garages and tries to keep rates low to attract shoppers.
 The problem, he said, is that Jamaica developed around the elevated train and has streets that are crowded beyond capacity. His group has estimated that there is currently a deficit of 500 parking spaces in the downtown area and that proposed developments would require the construction of garages to accommodate 2,000 more cars at an estimated cost of $32 million.
 But part of smart growth is reducing automobile use and traffic on streets. If Jamaica is to develop in a smart fashion, the report says, ''a significant portion of residents will have to be weaned away from 50 years of automobile dependency.''
 With the possible exception of the parking garages, Mr. Towery said most of what his development group has done or is proposing could be labeled as smart growth. He said the airport village would recycle urban land that already has a transportation infrastructure in place.
 New York State's passage of a brownfields remediation law last year will help with the land recycling by providing guidelines for cleanups of sites that currently have dirty uses, such a junkyards.
 Because of the contamination, Mr. Towery said, well located land parcels within a few blocks of the Air Train terminal can be acquired cheaply for redevelopment. ''We salivate at grunge,'' he said. ''Other people see blight, but we see sites.''

HEADLINE: Passion for the Tango Turns a Bedroom Into a Closet

BYLINE: By PENELOPE GREEN

 BODY:
DON'T call Bebe Winkler before 11 a.m. Not that you'll wake her. She's been dancing all night, and she'll be curled up with Lady Irene, her copper-colored poodle, on the chenille couch in her living room, the ringer turned to ''off'' on her phone. 
 Ms. Winkler, a decorator known for her traditional and luxurious interiors, has lately taken up the tango, and the dance has rewritten every aspect of her life, including where she spends the night. 
 That roomy corner bedroom in her East 55th Street apartment, for example, is now a super closet, a white laminate fantasy more likely found in a suburban McMansion (and the reason Ms. Winkler and Lady Irene are sleeping on the couch). 
 Inside the closet -- ''my wardrobe,'' as Ms. Winkler describes it -- in neat rows from wall to wall and floor to ceiling, are a staggered chorus line of gauzy, spangled leotards, slinky jersey skirts slashed to the thigh, and slyly arched and sequined tango heels, each piece as animate and sensual as the dance they were made for. 
 Five years ago, Ms. Winkler, a fastidious woman with sleek, copper-colored hair, copper-colored butterfly-wing eyebrows and the neat, economical movements of a 60's-era runway model -- which, indeed, Ms. Winkler used to be -- embodied a particular Manhattan archetype: the single, successful workaholic, an early Carrie Bradshaw prototype, but with a better work ethic.
 Her hair coiled into a tight chignon and her 5-foot-5 1/2 frame corralled in a severe uniform of perfectly tailored suits, Ms. Winkler drove herself hard through 14-hour days; she'd be home by 10 and asleep by 10:30, too tired to watch the evening news or eat more than a can of tuna fish standing at her kitchen counter. ''My clients said, 'Don't you have a life?' '' Ms Winkler said. '' 'I'm fine!' I'd say, but I was wiped out, exhausted.'' 
 One Saturday night she rented a video of ''Shall We Dance?,'' not the Astaire/Rogers confection but the winsome 1996 film by the Japanese director Masayuki Suo, about a middle-aged businessman who dreams of upending his drab, routinized life, and discovers ballroom dancing. 
 ''I thought, 'Well, that looks nice, maybe I'd like to do a box step,' '' Ms. Winkler said. That Monday, Ms. Winkler wandered into a Fred Astaire Dance Studio and sampled its half-hour free lesson. One lesson became 15, and soon she was dancing four or five nights a week: moving quickly from a box step into a fox trot, a rhumba and a cha cha. She'd leave the office by 5 o'clock, mystifying her colleagues, who were used to leaving hours before the boss (and having their home fax machines shudder into activity with late-night thoughts from Ms. Winkler). 
 THREE years ago, Ms. Winkler discovered the milongas, the nightly tango parties that erupt all over Manhattan in restaurants like Lafayette Grill, after the dinner crowd has gone home. 
 ''I loved my new life,'' she said. ''I loved that I had 'a life.' '' Her old wardrobe -- those suits -- no longer fit. ''I didn't want to buy anything that I couldn't dance in,'' she said, explaining a habit that grew daily. The chignon was put aside along with the suits, and soon she wasn't only buying dance clothes but designing them herself, and picking up shoes in Argentina, the home of the tango, on visits.
 When the three closets in her bedroom began to explode with clothes, Ms. Winkler made the sort of spatial decision (and the call to California Closets) that would make sense only to a New Yorker. 
 The result is a new hybrid, the live-in closet. Ms. Winkler has reluctantly kept her suits, sad, drab stepsisters among all the color and glitter, and added luxurious touches, like a television set, as well as an island of a bureau on top of which is strewn her collection of costume jewelry, and a treadmill, which she uses mostly as a place to hang things. 
 Like Ms. Winkler, this one-bedroom apartment is a Manhattan archetype, a collection of boxy rooms in a postwar building that Ms. Winkler has had for more than three decades -- rent-stabilized, its rent has risen from $600 to $1,197. And it is only by accident that it wears its current luxurious outfit.
 Ms. Winkler, an indifferent nester for whom the apartment has always been more of a carry-all than a home -- ''I was always the shoemaker without shoes,'' she said -- has mostly lived with blank walls, a television set on a stand and, sometimes, a bed. She slept on a couch when she first moved here with her mother in the late 1960's.
 ''All that mattered was that mother had a pretty bedroom,'' Ms. Winkler said. ''The rest was just drab.'' 
 When her mother died in 1971, Ms. Winkler moved to the bedroom, but didn't alter a thing. 
 Her first career was as a fittings model, for the designer Stan Herman. A look-alike for Peggy Moffitt, the 1960's Rudi Gernreich model, Ms. Winkler was Mr. Herman's favorite, he said. 
 ''She was so fastidious and so sharp,'' Mr. Herman said the other day, ''and I loved fitting on her because her shape was so human.'' He designed his culture-shocking pants suits -- in the days when women were often not allowed in a restaurant wearing pants -- to fit Ms. Winkler's body. ''It was her proportions that made it all work,'' he said. 
 When Ms. Winkler made the move, as she put it, from Seventh Avenue to Third, from model to lady decorator, her style, Mr. Herman said, was as ''fastidious, furious, and feminine as Bebe herself.'' 
 Still, her apartment remained basically empty. In the mid-80's, Ms. Winkler turned her postwar boxes into prewar galleries, using crown moldings to articulate three separate ceiling areas in the main room. She also applied moldings to the herd of doors in the front hall. But despite a reputation for much fringe and flair, not so much as a throw pillow was allowed in.
 ''When you'd think of Bebe,'' said Joan Kron, editor in chief of Avenue magazine in the 1980's, now a contributor to Allure magazine, ''you'd think of fringe and leopard print and sequins. You'd think of a perfectly set table.'' 
 Ms. Winkler, however, has set the table only once in her own home. The longtime chairwoman of the United Cerebral Palsy House Tour, she offered her undecorated apartment as a stopgap one year in the mid-1990's. The tour was short one decorator, and Ms. Winkler, hard at work on the Bel Air mansion of the philanthropist Iris Cantor, called the show house tour director, Suzanne Sokolov, and said, ''Use mine, we'll figure something out.'' 
 The week before the tour, she filled it as she would one of her own jobs, borrowing gilt-edged mirrors and framed botanicals, a faun-colored chenille couch wide enough to sleep on and three feet deep in sequined and brocade pillows, and a 30's-style goat-skin-covered table.
 The day it was photographed, the crew got hungry and Ms. Winkler ordered Chinese. She upended the cartons into Tiffany platters, and set the table within an inch of itself, she said, with Tiffany plates and French crystal, for the first and last time.
 ''That goat skin is impervious to food,'' she said. ''Not that it's ever seen too much of it.'' That night, she stayed up late admiring her ''new'' apartment. ''I called my accountant the next day,'' she said, ''and I told him, 'Sharpen your pencil, I'm keeping it all!' '' 
 Ms. Winkler still makes a dinner of a can of tuna fish, standing at her kitchen counter. ''I don't want to sit and dine,'' she said. ''I'm too impatient. I just want to eat the tuna fish and go dancing.''

HEADLINE: A Tiny Museum Achieves Its Towering Ambition

BYLINE: By JULIE V. IOVINE

 BODY:
FOR most people skyscrapers are just part of the visual furniture that makes New York New York. For Carol Willis, they are infinitely more: ''the most important contribution of American culture to the history of architecture,'' she says, and an important ingredient in Manhattan's heady cocktail of pride, ambition and glamour. It's something she feels on such a personal level that she chose her current apartment largely for one reason: it has a prime view of the Empire State Building. 
 Over the last eight years, Ms. Willis, 55, an architecture historian and professor of urban studies at Columbia University, has turned that personal obsession into a public mission. ''New York is the pre-eminent skyscraper city,'' she said, sitting in her lower-Manhattan office surrounded by two huge aerial photographs of the neighborhood before and after the World Trade Center was built. ''We are synonymous with the skyscraper, and our image in the world is a skyline.'' 
 It seemed obvious to her that there ought to be a museum about them. With no money, no location and nothing to put in such a museum, Ms. Willis somehow or other managed to line up a star architect to design it, a luxury developer to donate a space and even a promise from the American Institute of Architects to lend the original World Trade Center model as the centerpiece of the collection-to-be. 
 On April 2, the Skyscraper Museum will open to the public. (A curtain-raising party is scheduled tomorrow.) But the institution will convey an additional message Ms. Willis could never have envisioned when she began her quest in 1995. 
 Since that time, of course, the meaning of skyscrapers -- and in particular, the resonance of the lower-Manhattan skyline -- has changed forever. No longer mere symbols of ambition and triumph, they now also inspire a sense of vulnerability, fear and mortality. And lest anyone overlook that complication, the museum is situated just a few blocks from the open wound where the twin towers once stood. 
 Skyscrapers have always had a complex story to tell, according to Ms. Willis. The museum will not treat them as relics, or some musty historic collection gathered for the amusement of old-timers. ''I'm a person who cares about the present and the future,'' she said, adding that the first exhibition will concentrate on both the heroic skyscrapers of the 1920's and the new stars now rising in Asia. ''l want to make the argument that the subject of skyscrapers is current.''
 Although tucked out of the way at the far end of West Street behind the new Ritz-Carlton Hotel, the museum is anything but retiring. With both floors and ceilings sheathed in smooth steel polished to a mirror finish, the interior creates a purposefully dazzling effect that its architect, Roger Duffy of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, calls ''vertical Versailles.'' 
 In the reflective surfaces overhead and underfoot, the single gallery space and everything in it, from tall back-lighted vitrines to a visitor's high-heeled boots, looks impossibly elongated. Physically the space is rather small, at 5,000 square feet. The ceilings are just over 11 feet high. But the effect, as Mr. Duffy explained, is an expansive illusion of volume and even a bit of ''that arresting feeling of seeing skyscrapers for the first time.'' 
 Just inside the entrance, the donors' names are etched -- in a Star Wars-style scroll -- on the ceiling. A mirrored ramp, lined with blowups of skyscraper postcards and World Trade Center construction photos, leads up to the exhibition space. 
 Two weeks before the opening party, the mirrored floor remained under a protective coating. (Ms. Willis and her colleagues are still deciding whether to require visitors to don felt booties, to maintain the shine.) Only in patches was it possible to get a sense of the effect to come. Just as Ms. Willis was trying to explain how the 11-foot showcases would look many times taller when reflected, a construction worker -- yellow magnetic ruler in hand, gold rings in ear -- interrupted to ask if it would be possible to see up women's skirts. ''Yes, definitely,'' Ms. Willis answered with a shrug. ''Then I guess it's going to be a really popular place,'' he replied. 
 Visitors to the museum will discover voyeuristic views of another sort as well: the history of the city, with the top layer peeled back revealing the men, materials and even the minutiae of the leasing deals that went into building its mighty structures. 
 Ms. Willis's theory is that skyscrapers represent a kind of urban flowering. When conditions are just right -- banks are lending, developers are competing, zoning is generous and the economy is rosy -- they bloom. The glory days of the New York skyscraper were between 1912 and 1930, when the skyline, especially downtown, sprouted stunners like the Woolworth Building with its flamboyantly Gothic masonry, Cities Service (now at 70 Pine Street) with its illuminated glass spire and, moving north, the Chrysler Building with those shiny steel epaulets.
 Ms. Willis pointed to a large photograph of two men sliding a carved limestone panel into place on a section of the Empire State Building. ''In its day, the Empire State Building was the most efficient building ever built,'' she said. ''Everything was delivered to the site ready to go. It took 11 months to build; the same time it took for the Chrysler Building even though, at two million square feet, the Empire State Building was twice as large.'' 
 At the moment such construction photographs make up the bulk of the museum's collection. Among the most precious is a binder of progress photos with handwritten notations documenting the construction of the Empire State Building. It was donated by the Starrett family, whose company oversaw construction. Other treasures include a chunk of an early composite I-beam, from the 1890's, and countless documents that Ms. Willis scrounged from the archives of buildings that were about to be sold. But the focus will be less on amassing golden-age artifacts than on telling stories in order to understand how cities take shape.
 How Ms. Willis pulled it off is a story all its own. Flying around from appointment to appointment on a flea-market Schwinn, her wispy blond hair crammed into a helmet, she began by talking to anyone who would listen. Lecturing on how economic forces and zoning laws carved the distinctive spires of the earliest skyscrapers, she made an ally in the architect David Childs, who says he was dazzled by ''her passion and knowledge.'' That connection led to a host of experts willing to work pro bono, including an engineer, a construction company and even the graphic design group Pentagram. 
 Mr. Childs also introduced Ms. Willis to Mr. Duffy, who is his colleague at Skidmore, Owings & Merrill. ''She didn't have anything,'' Mr. Duffy recalled of their first meeting at the Grand Central Terminal Oyster Bar. ''There was no program, no money. She just looked really determined.'' He happily signed on. He would be donating his labors, she told him, but he would have complete artistic freedom. Both figured it would take a year.
 Finding a home was actually easier. In the late 90's there was plenty of unoccupied downtown space, which developers were happy to contribute, at least until the market picked up.
 With ink barely dry on a lease with a 30-day cancellation clause, the Skyscraper Museum opened in 1997 at 44 Wall Street, a 1926 tower decked out in the 1960's with white marble columns. It stayed there barely a year before moving on to 16 Wall Street, an Art Deco beauty. The museum lasted there for one and a half years, attracting some 20,000 visitors, before the building was sold and Ms. Willis and her staff of three had to pull up stakes and move off the beaten path to 110 Maiden Lane. 
 Sept. 11 shut that location down, but within three months, Ms. Willis had managed to mount a show on the twin towers and their construction that ran for four months at the New York Historical Society. 
 A deal with Donald Trump at the historical gem 40 Wall Street fell through, but by then Ms. Willis was already negotiating with the Battery Park City Authority and the Millennium Partners, a high-end developer with an interest in the project. The Skyscraper Museum would be the required public amenity included in the developer's bid to develop a site on the southernmost block of Battery Park City In September 2002, Ms. Willis signed a 67-year rent-free lease for 5,000 square feet on the ground floor on the backside of what became the Ritz-Carlton Hotel. 
 Of the $3 million needed for construction, half came through public monies: $1 million from the city and $500,000 from the Battery Park City Authority. The developers Larry Silverstein and Jerry Speyer have each given $100,000. In addition, Ms. Willis, who worked without pay for four years, and her husband, Mark, an executive at J. P Morgan Chase, have donated $100,000, she said.
 A capital campaign is under way to raise $10 million more, including $2.5 million for an endowment. While some critics wonder if Ms. Willis, whose credentials are primarily academic, would be better served by a professional fund-raiser, Mr. Duffy has no doubts about her ability to get the most out of people. He didn't even keep track of the time he spent volunteering for her project. ''I found myself working as hard for her as I do for real clients,'' he said. ''She demands attention and she gets it.''
 But raising money and attracting visitors are different matters. It's not self-evident what the audience for a museum like this might be in the New York of 2004. The heyday of the city's skyscrapers, maybe even the country's skyscrapers, had ended before 9/11. The race to build the tallest building is being run in Asia and the Middle East now. Even London is building more skyscrapers at the moment than almost any city in the United States. 
 ''In America, there's almost an attitude of 'been there, done that,' '' said Ron Klemencic, the chairman of the Council of Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat. ''They're just not as compelling for us as they are for a country trying to show that their world economy has arrived.'' 
 Ms. Willis said that she expects to see a lot of tourists, especially from Germany, France and Japan, where the appetite for stories about both Manhattan's martini years and large-scale construction is large. And there will also be tour programs for school children and professional groups. 
 In the end, however, the museum, with its seductive mirrored floors, really is meant to be a tease. Or as Mr. Duffy said, ''The museum is just a prelude, the real museum is the city itself.''

HEADLINE: Looking for a New Job? Help May Be Snoozing Next to You

BYLINE: By SHIRA BOSS-BICAK

 BODY:
After Kevan Jackson was laid off from his management post at the New-York Historical Society last May, he discovered a very useful addition to his job hunt equipage: his wife, Karla the Losen.
 At first Mr. Jackson tackled his latest job search as he had approached others, by contacting recruiters and expecting interviews to be lined up. But before long, he realized he needed to do more networking, and Ms. the Losen, a marketing executive, has ''been very proactive,'' he said. ''She's broadcast to everyone we know that I'm looking.'' 
 The only people as vested in a job quest as unemployed people themselves are job seekers' partners and spouses. With job creation increasing but still falling short of forecasts, and the average duration of unemployment for professionals at nearly 24 weeks, spouses and partners are campaigning for their loved ones with abandon.
 ''The dynamics of the professional world have changed recently,'' said Jill Niemczyk, an executive recruiter at Sextant Search Partners in New York. ''Today we have more men in their 30's married to professional women, so they can have more input.'' 
 Spouses have always offered moral support to their partners, but now they are reaching deep into their own personal and professional networks to give leads, circulate resumes and even set up meetings. 
 Human resources consultants say that these days nearly anything is acceptable when a husband or wife helps a spouse look for a job, from asking a large employer if a spouse can use the company's resource library to pressing a resume into the hands of the human resources director. Federal employment law says nothing against an employer relying on a word of mouth recommendation to fill a job opening, so the door is open for an employee's significant other to get an inside track.
 ''Unless a company has a policy against hiring close relatives, it's O.K. to ask,'' said Leslie B. Prager, a career counselor at the Prager-Bernstein Group, a career consulting and outplacement firm in New York.
 That is exactly what Elissa Roberts did when she was leaving her job in the finance department of a large retail corporation in Manhattan for a new job last year. Her husband had left his job in the public schools to try to land a university position and had turned to temporary work to generate some income.
 A week before Ms. Roberts left her job, her employer had not hired a successor and was going to have to bring in a temporary worker. ''I said, 'Why don't you bring in my husband?''' Ms. Roberts recalled. 
 While her husband initially wondered if her lobbying for him would be ''a little weird,'' she said, he quickly agreed that anything was worth a shot. ''It's the same as my recommending a friend, which I've done numerous times,'' Ms. Roberts said. ''You vouch for them.''
 Her husband was hired on a temporary basis, trained by his wife, and subsequently hired as a regular employee, in a job that it turns out he enjoys more than his wife did.
 Many spouses and partners of job seekers are delving into their own alumni and professional databases for contacts and quietly sharing company-supplied passwords to electronic resources, according to numerous job seekers and career counselors. 
 Ms. the Losen has reached out to friends, co-workers, relatives of co-workers and professional organizations on behalf of Mr. Jackson. She went straight to the chairman of her company, who has a background in the media field that Mr. Jackson worked in previously and wants to re-enter, and requested an informational interview for her husband.
 ''I said, 'Kevan's in search of a job, you have similar interests, and he'd love to talk to you,''' Ms. the Losen said.
 Like many spouses, she also stays tuned for any informal information she receives that might help her husband's search. ''If someone says something about a media organization, my ears perk up and I'm not afraid to say, 'Can my husband call you?''' Ms. the Losen said.
 Indeed, sometimes the employed spouses are more aggressive than their job-searching counterparts to the point of aggravating their partners. Mr. Jackson says his wife's involvement has not pressured him. But Internet message boards are full of complaints from job seekers that their spouses are constantly asking about the status of the job search and their day-to-day efforts. 
 ''The one who's looking should guide the spouse's level of involvement,'' Ms. Carter said. ''The problem we've seen is that the employed spouse tries to direct the job search for their partner.'' 
 Bradford Agry, a partner at CareerTeam Partners, a career consulting firm in New York, urges a direct and brief approach for spouses helping unemployed partners. ''Call or e-mail on their behalf, and let them take it from there,'' he said. Unfortunately, a spouse who provides a contact, he said, can be tempted to follow up to the point of nagging. He has also noticed spouses who make introductions, then hover while their unemployed partners try to talk business with the new contacts. ''It's best handled by making an introduction and then getting out,'' Mr. Agry said.
 The introduction should be a well-honed pitch, useful even when the job-hunting spouse is not present, according to Andrea R. Nierenberg, author of the book ''Nonstop Networking'' (Capital Books, 2002). 
 ''You have a 20-second introduction of yourself that you use when you meet people, now you need a 20-second introduction of them as well,'' she said. 
 Sometimes a spouse's network becomes useful in a less-direct way. Mukul Kochhar, a graduate student at the Columbia Business School, hoped to find a summer job in equity research, the same field his wife is in. Her firm has a policy of not hiring close relatives of employees, but his wife gave him pointers in mock interviews and introduced him to others in the field who could provide helpful advice.
 ''I'm friendly with her friends, so could tap into that network,'' he said. ''Because we met in a more casual environment, they could give a more honest opinion than what they might have told me in a corporate setting.'' He wound up switching gears and finding a summer job at a hedge fund. 
 Career counselors say that even when a spouse is not actively helping with a job search, job seekers who are married or in a long-term relationship tend to have an edge. ''Having a spouse is helpful on a number of levels,'' Mr. Agry said. ''I worked with a client who was an architect. He was not in a relationship and did not have as big a network. That was more difficult.''

HEADLINE: $8.3 Million Given to Neediest Cases Fund

BYLINE: By KARI HASKELL

 BODY:
Over three months, from Nov. 2, 2003, to Jan. 31, 2004, daily articles printed in The New York Times looked into the fragile lives of some New Yorkers and explored how unforeseen misfortune put them in the grip of poverty. In case after case, people who received emergency assistance from The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund told how the aid gave them hope.
 In the end, the campaign turned out to be among the most successful in the fund's 93-year history -- and the most challenging. Over the course of the three-month fund-raising effort, a total of 12,010 individual and institutional donors gave $8,279,371. That sum was the third-largest ever for the fund, but it was 6 percent less than the $8,806,761 raised last year. Donor support was down 16 percent, fund officials said. 
 ''In this soft economy, the total dollars and total donors are down, but there's a big silver lining in this year's figures,'' said Jack Rosenthal, the president of The New York Times Company Foundation, which administers the fund. ''The average gift was $689 -- and that's a gratifying 10 percent higher than last year.''
 Contributions ranged from a few dollars to a $1 million gift from the Starr Foundation, a private nonprofit group associated with the American International Group. About a thousand donations, totaling $250,869.50, were submitted through an online donation service, CharityWave.com. A group of first- and second-year analysts from several investment banks continued a decade-long tradition by collecting $134,868 from their colleagues. The fund also received $707,602.63 from bequests and trusts.
 ''This money is extraordinarily important,'' said Louise B. Greilsheimer, vice president of agency and external relations for UJA-Federation of New York, one of the seven charities supported by the Neediest Cases Fund. 
 The money helps UJA-Federation agencies offer cash assistance to meet emergency housing, clothing, food and transportation needs, she said. 
 ''The articles,'' Ms. Greilsheimer continued, ''raise awareness of New York City's affluent and educated population about people who are falling behind. They give you real people behind the numbers.''
 Sometimes, raising awareness results in acts of kindness that can change a person's life. This year's campaign was no exception.
 When Roger Greene, director of marketing for the New York College of Podiatric Medicine, read an article published on Nov. 13 about Frederick Hart, 46, he was moved.
 The article told of persistent foot problems that kept Mr. Hart from holding a job and getting off public assistance. After three operations to shave bone from his feet and place metal straightening pins and screws in his toes to stop pain, Mr. Hart found little relief. He hoped to take comfort from special shoes, for which he received $99 from Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, another of the charities supported by the Neediest Cases Fund.
 ''He had been through so much - been through so much pain for years,'' said Mr. Greene, who shared the story with doctors at the college.
 When Dr. Justin Wernick, the chairman of the Department of Orthopedic Sciences at the college, heard the story, he, too, was compelled to help beyond providing shoes.
 Mr. Hart met with Dr. Wernick at the Foot Clinics of New York, a service run by the college. 
 For the first time, Mr. Hart felt that someone understood what he had been going through. ''This professor looked at me, he told me something I had never heard before -- I had multiple cysts,'' Mr. Hart said.
 Last Tuesday, Dr. Wernick and a colleague, Dr. Mark Mandato, operated on Mr. Hart, beginning a six- to seven-month treatment plan. 
 After the surgery, Mr. Hart was ecstatic. ''This is a blessing to go through all of this,'' he said. ''I wasn't expecting this. I feel like there is hope now.'' The procedure and maintenance visits would have cost more than $5,000 -- an amount he could never pay.
 Mr. Hart said he saw the surgery as the beginning of a new life. He added that he could not believe that his windfall resulted from an article about finding money for the proper shoes. ''Without the article, I would have never had this response,'' he said. 
 ''I am fortunate. Out of all the people in the city, my article resulted in people helping me. I feel special.''

HEADLINE: Office Developer to Add Residential Projects As Well

BYLINE: By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
PARSIPPANY-BASED SJP Properties, a 20-year-old company known for its high-end office developments, is ''adding another wing to the factory,'' in the words of its chairman and chief executive, Steven J. Pozycki. Despite the metaphor, SJP is not moving into industrial development; in fact, it is moving into residential.
 SJP Residential Properties, a new arm of the company that will focus on building upscale rental apartments and condominiums, has just been established, and an executive has been recruited from the Applied Development Companies to run it.
 ''We want to diversify, and residential is the most creative way to go,'' Mr. Pozycki said. ''Certainly, we have the factory to do it.'' SJP's ''factory,'' he said, is made up of groups of veteran employees skilled at different tasks, like preplanning projects, securing approvals, financing, engineering, design and construction. 
 ''We can produce,'' Mr. Pozycki said. ''We are just adding a new product to our line.''
 The firm hired a longtime Applied Development executive, Allen F. Goldman, to run the new business. In his 13 years with Applied, Mr. Goldman developed a number of high-profile multifamily projects along the Hudson waterfront, including the Shipyard in Hoboken, Port Liberte in Jersey City, the Essex and Sussex in Spring Lake, Portside Towers in Jersey City and the Palisades in Fort Lee.
 Mr. Goldman said he had decided to leave Applied, where the brothers David and Michael Barry have succeeded their father, Joseph Barry, who was indicted last fall on 16 charges of bribery, conspiracy and fraud, in a quest for more independence.
 ''Now I get to walk in and start working with all of SJP's existing in-house resources,'' Mr. Goldman said. ''Everyone will benefit from our combined knowledge base.''
 Mr. Goldman said that he had entertained other offers and also considered starting up his own development firm, but that ''SJP has demonstrated its excellence with many different projects, and I've been given an opportunity to exploit that strength.''
 SJP Residential will focus on developing rental and for-sale apartment buildings in New York City, Westchester, Long Island, Connecticut and New Jersey, Mr. Goldman said. SJP Properties will continue building offices within that same territory, Mr. Pozycki said.
 ''Certainly, the office market has been difficult for the last while,'' Mr. Pozycki said. ''The situation was exacerbated by mass layoffs, but we still managed to do all right. As the economy comes back and expands, so will we.''
 THE SJP portfolio comprises more than 12 million square feet of office space with property that has the potential to be developed into an additional 6 million square feet of space. 
 Since the completion of its Waterfront Corporate Center in Hoboken last year, SJP has taken on projects for Lucent Technologies and Tiffany & Company, Mr. Pozycki noted, and is working on plans for another as yet undisclosed project. SJP has frequently been involved in partnerships with the Newark-based Prudential Insurance on major projects -- and currently channels more of the insurance company's investment funds into real estate than any other company in the country, according to Mr. Pozycki.
 Mr. Goldman said that in his experience, ''many people talk about what new things they want to do in residential development, but it doesn't often get delivered.'' He added: ''Steve Pozycki and SJP have really developed an outstanding reputation for being sensitive to the community, and for being mindful of the details -- satisfying what the market wants. I work the same way, and I think it's the way to be successful.''
 The two executives said that real estate companies had been evolving over the years to take on a wider focus and that SJP's move was in line with that trend. ''Up until recently,'' Mr. Goldman said, ''there were office guys, retail-strip mall guys and residential guys in this business. Now, residential is usually created with some degree of retail, and sometimes office -- and developers need to have a more integrated approach.''
 Mr. Goldman said SJP Residential was already exploring a variety of different types of projects, from a high-rise apartment building in Manhattan to a gated community in suburban New Jersey.
 ''Looking at the geographic area, it's large enough to take advantage of many different kinds of opportunity -- urban, infill, suburban, rental, for sale, ground-up or rehab,'' Mr. Goldman said. ''The characteristic that is going to be running through any of these that we do is that we are looking for the ultimate -- something that is exactly the right thing at the right time for a particular community.''
 Mr. Pozycki says SJP's method is to assemble a development team for each of its own projects when they are still in the planning stages. The teams include architects, engineers, land-use attorneys and traffic planners. When working with other companies' projects, SJP provides an array of consulting services, with its personnel serving as contractors, project engineers and data specialists, and providing advice on such things as elevators and glass curtain walls for the exterior of a building.
 ''With about 100 people, we have one of the bigger in-house staffs,'' Mr. Pozycki said. ''That allows us to respond quickly, and precisely, to a particular building or town. It's sort of a Formula One team approach.''
 Mr. Goldman said he was bringing a record of ''turnaround'' success to the SJP team, having successfully developed projects that had been abandoned by others.
 THE last project Mr. Goldman developed with Applied, the Palisades, a 41-story, 538-unit apartment building with an adjacent 20 high-end rental town homes, recently sold for $222.5 million. 
 ''That site lay fallow for nearly 30 years,'' Mr. Goldman said. ''It changed hands a number of times. Many looked at it and were unsure how to develop it because of its difficult site topography. There is a 190-foot elevation rise -- it's along the Palisades cliffs, immediately south of the George Washington Bridge. I came on the scene in '98, and said to myself, 'We could build the pre-eminent luxury building in New Jersey right here.' ''
 Upon completion of the Palisades at the end of last year, it was sold to Crescent Heights, a Miami-based company that converts apartment buildings to condominiums.
 With the Shipyard in Hoboken, Mr. Goldman said the big risk was taking on a ''brownfield'' site. At the point Applied began work on that apartment-tower project -- 1992 -- Hoboken's waterfront was still characterized by worn-out industrial buildings and seedy bars, Mr. Goldman recalled. 
 ''A really strong developer sees opportunity where others don't,'' he said. ''You have to recognize the underlying strengths that can make a particular site a winner -- and then, of course, you have to make good on those.''

HEADLINE: Through Gaps in System, Nurse Left Trail of Grief

BYLINE: This article is by Richard Perez-Pena, David Kocieniewski and Jason George.

 BODY:
He tried suicide at least three times, did four stints at mental hospitals, broke into a colleague's house and wanted a doctor prosecuted just for drawing his blood.
 He was once found wearing surgical scrubs at the missile controls of a nuclear submarine, and he was known in his neighborhood for his nighttime chasing of cats.
 And even before the deaths that led to his arrest in December, at least four times in his career as a nurse, people claimed Charles Cullen might have killed patients in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
 Mr. Cullen, who has told prosecutors he killed perhaps 40 people with intentional drug overdoses, defies the cliche about serial killers: that nobody suspected anything, nobody noticed anything strange. Wherever he went, people found his behavior erratic, suspicious, even criminal. 
 In hindsight, his life looks like a trail of signal flares, warning of instability and a capacity to harm himself or others. Yet Mr. Cullen was able to go from job to job for a decade after the first homicide accusation, confounding co-workers, government investigators and relatives of patients who died. If his story is true, he is among the most prolific serial killers in American history.
 It was his guile, in part, that allowed him to elude capture all those years. Mr. Cullen is suspected of choosing jobs and drugs that made it possible to kill without drawing much attention.
 But interviews with dozens of colleagues, medical examiners, prosecutors, investigators and patients' relatives, and reviews of court records and state files show this: Mr. Cullen was able to continue mostly because of systemic failures, and his career reveals gaping holes in hospital and government systems for weeding out people who harm patients.
 Supervisors and government officials who were looking over his shoulder also failed. More than a decade ago, a medical examiner neglected to order a test on a dead patient that investigators now say might have stopped Mr. Cullen. Another coroner believed that a death was not accidental but did not alert prosecutors or the police. And several times when the police, prosecutors, medical examiners and licensing authorities investigated deaths that might have been linked to Mr. Cullen, they did not look deep enough to learn of previous allegations.
 Employers did not report him to one another, to oversight agencies, or to law enforcement, often because they were not required to. Some even brushed off allegations by victims' families or his co-workers.
 The review of Mr. Cullen's career also sheds light on dark corners of the nursing world: how those who want to harm are sometimes drawn to the hard-to-staff night shifts; how shortages of nurses can lead hospitals not to inquire aggressively into a job candidate's past.
 Mr. Cullen, 44, who has been charged so far with just one murder, has stopped cooperating. His lawyer, who would not be interviewed, has made clear in court that Mr. Cullen's mental state will be part of his defense, as he seeks to avoid the death penalty.
 Meanwhile, state lawmakers are trying to devise ways to improve hospitals' ability to know about troubled employees, and to act on that knowledge.
 But as officials in New Jersey and Pennsylvania piece together Mr. Cullen's 16-year nursing career, they concede they will never know the complete truth, leaving families to wonder about the deaths of their loved ones. Evidence deteriorates, and investigators must rely on Mr. Cullen's faded memory if he decides to cooperate. 
 The cost of exhuming bodies, performing autopsies, interviewing witnesses and examining medical records is already straining the capacities of several small counties.
 ''Our hope is to provide closure for as many families as possible,'' said James B. Martin, the district attorney in Lehigh County, Pa., where investigators suspect Mr. Cullen killed 12 people. ''But in reality, it is highly unlikely that we'll get them all.''

The Navy Career
Odd Behavior on Sub Draws Sailors' Ridicule
 On long patrols under the frigid Atlantic, Petty Officer First Class Michael L. Leinen expected stress, expected danger, trained for nasty surprises aboard the submarine Woodrow Wilson. But he said nothing prepared him for what he found one day in the early 1980's, when he supervised the team that operated the sub's arsenal of 16 Poseidon ballistic missiles.
 At the control panel for those nuclear-armed missiles sat Petty Officer Third Class Charles Cullen, not in uniform, but in a green surgical gown, mask and gloves taken from a medical cabinet. Mr. Leinen said he had punished Mr. Cullen, who could not have fired the missiles on his own, but could never get him to explain the outfit.
 It was just one troubling incident involving Mr. Cullen that former shipmates recalled. In dry land training, he had done well, becoming a missile technician and passing the rigorous psychological screening for submariners, but he was ill equipped for what lay ahead.
 Spending more than two months at a stretch submerged in a steel tube, sailors judged new shipmates, ''newbies,'' by how they handled pressure and related to others. Experienced sailors hazed each newbie mercilessly, finding weaknesses and hammering at them.
 ''They had that honed on Wilson to a fine art,'' said John M. Darnielle, who served with Mr. Cullen.
 Usually, a sailor showed he could take it, and the hazing ended with his first patrol, but not for Mr. Cullen. He remained the favored target, mocked for muttering under his breath while being hazed and for his ''fish belly white'' skin. Even the newest sailors freely insulted him. ''In an environment devoid of many entertainments, these guys would make their own by messing with Charlie,'' Mr. Darnielle said.
 Marlin Emswiler, Mr. Cullen's bunkmate, described him as socially inept. ''Charlie hung out with Charlie,'' he said.
 That solitude was noted throughout his life. Neighbors from his childhood on Kling Street in West Orange, N.J., recalled Mr. Cullen, the youngest of eight siblings, as a quiet, slight boy who was smart but awkward. His father, Edmond, a bus driver, died when Charles was an infant. The yearbooks from West Orange High School mention Charles just once, on the Italian club roster, but he is not in the club photo.
 A car accident killed his mother, Florence, during his senior year, leaving Mr. Cullen orphaned. Shortly after her death, he enlisted in the Navy.
 Mr. Emswiler recalled that in his days on the Wilson, Mr. Cullen talked of becoming a nurse. ''He said, 'I like helping people.'''
 But things got only worse in the Navy. He was transferred to the Canopus, a supply ship, but a mere change of assignments was apparently not enough.
 Mr. Cullen tried to kill himself, said Mr. Leinen and a current Navy official, one of several attempts. Officials said they were not sure, or could not say, precisely how he had tried to take his life, but the attempt led to his discharge in March 1984.
 His experience in the Navy would mirror the arc of his later life: the inability to bond with others, the disciplinary problems and odd behavior, and, finally, the attempts at a fresh start by moving to a new place where no one knew of his past.
 Returning to New Jersey, Mr. Cullen enrolled at Mountainside Hospital School of Nursing, in Montclair. In 1987, he graduated, married Adrienne Taub, and got his first nursing job, at St. Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston, N.J.
 Mr. Cullen was quiet and stubbornly private while he was at St. Barnabas, recalled Jeanne T. Hackett, a chief technician who worked with him on the burn ward there.
 ''You'd ask, 'Are you married?' or anything like that, and you'd get one-word answers,'' she said. ''I remember the day I laid eyes on his car, and I said, 'Oh my God, now I know something about Charlie Cullen: I know what his car looks like.'''
 His attempts at warmth with patients were forced, she said. ''It was like he was going through the motions, patting someone on the hand and telling them they'd be O.K.''
 Mr. Cullen spent four years at St. Barnabas, first as a hospital employee, and then through a related nursing agency, Medical Center Health Care Services. The agency effectively fired him in January 1992.
 ''At the end, he wasn't being given any more work,'' said Robin Lally, a hospital spokeswoman. She and his former colleagues say they do not know why.
 Mr. Cullen's longevity at St. Barnabas was an anomaly; his career spanned nine jobs over the next 11 years. But the way he left -- forced out under murky circumstances for reasons that apparently did not reach future employers -- set a lasting and ultimately deadly trend.

The Favored Shift
Seriously Ill Patients And Little Supervision
 Reporting for duty at Warren Hospital in Phillipsburg, N.J., in February 1992, Mr. Cullen found his niche, the sort of job he would seek out repeatedly: the kind that made it easy to kill, and easy for killing to go unnoticed.
 He worked in the cardiac and intensive care units, where death is often expected, surrounded by the most gravely ill patients, many of them unconscious. In such wards, a single nurse handles several patients and spends time alone with them, unsupervised, especially on the graveyard shifts Mr. Cullen preferred, when the need for human interaction is minimal and the only sound heard for hours is the rhythmic beeping of monitors. Several medical serial killers have found working nights, with the sickest of patients, to their liking.
 In these units, patients might need a range of dangerous drugs on a moment's notice, so nurses have relatively free access to them. The stress and nighttime hours make these jobs hard to fill. Mr. Cullen, who volunteered for such work, would have seemed like a welcome relief.
 Even as Mr. Cullen settled into his preferred professional routine, his life began to unravel. He moved his family, which included two young daughters, to Phillipsburg, a struggling little town on the Delaware River in northwestern New Jersey, where they bought a modest red-brick house on the outskirts. He seemed to have pieced together a secure existence, but quickly lost his grip on it.
 Ms. Taub filed for divorce in January 1993, claiming that Mr. Cullen had refused to talk to her or sleep with her for years. She accused him of beating their Yorkshire terriers and zipping one dog into a bowling-ball bag. ''I was awakened many nights by the screams of those dogs,'' she said in divorce papers.
 He lost custody of his daughters and moved, alone, into a basement apartment on Shafer Avenue in central Phillipsburg, where he lived for 10 years.
 As his marriage collapsed, the erratic behavior spilled into his working life. He started harassing another Warren Hospital nurse, Michelle Tomlinson.
 ''Charles had been following her around at work and tried to give her an engagement ring,'' a detective, Barry Portz, wrote in a police report. He wrote that despite her pleas to stop, ''he calls by phone continuously.''
 Before dawn on March 23, 1993, Mr. Cullen smashed a window in Ms. Tomlinson's kitchen door, let himself in and walked through her house in Northampton County, Pa., while she and her 6-year-old son slept. He was booked on felony charges and released. ''He admitted it, but he had this fantasy that they were boyfriend-girlfriend,'' said Mr. Portz, who is now retired from police work.
 The supervisor for Mr. Cullen, Corinne Trembler, told detectives that the day after his arrest, he tried again to kill himself. The detectives did not note in their reports how Mr. Cullen made this attempt, at least his second. He took two months off work, and court papers show that he was treated at two psychiatric facilities, including Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital in Parsippany, N.J.
 On Aug. 10, he pleaded guilty to misdemeanor trespassing and was sentenced to a year's probation. He appealed the conviction, filing a succession of mostly handwritten, barely legible papers.
 Yet all the bizarre events of 1993 paled next to what followed: For the first time, Charles Cullen was accused of murder. This was the first opportunity to stop him, the first chance for the authorities or an employer to keep him from continuing to work as a nurse.
 On Aug. 30, 1993, Helen C. Dean, 91, was recovering nicely from breast cancer surgery at Warren, ready to be discharged. A male nurse not assigned to her ward entered her room, told her son, Larry, to leave, and gave her an injection no doctor had ordered. ''He stuck me,'' she told her son when he returned. Relatives say Larry and Helen Dean complained to doctors and nurses, and even pointed out the nurse to his colleagues later, but no one took action.
 The next day, Mrs. Dean was released, but ''she looked green,'' said her niece, Sharon Jones. That afternoon, Mrs. Dean suffered heart failure and died.
 Larry Dean told the county prosecutor's office that his mother had been murdered, that he knew who had done it, and how. The prosecutor's office and medical examiner investigated, confirmed the unprescribed injection, and determined that the male nurse was almost certainly Charles Cullen.
 But an autopsy was marred by a simple oversight that now looms large. Mrs. Dean's blood and tissue were tested for 100 possible toxic chemicals, but digoxin, a common heart medication that can be fatal in large doses, was not on that list.
 Investigators from several counties now say it is clear that digoxin was Mr. Cullen's favorite weapon.
 Dr. Isidore Mihalakis, the local medical examiner, said he had been out of town and that another doctor had done the autopsy. The failure to test for digoxin was a potentially crucial oversight, he conceded. Asked how it happened, he said, ''I have no idea.''
 Ms. Jones said she and her cousin Larry Dean had urged investigators at the time to test for digoxin, a conversation Dr. Mihalakis said he did not recall.
 The prosecutor's office gave lie detector tests to a handful of nurses, all women except Mr. Cullen. Kay Shea, a hospital spokeswoman, said he passed the test, but an official involved in the inquiry said it was inconclusive.
 The prosecutor's office dropped the case. Frank Bucsi, now the acting Warren County prosecutor, has reopened it, and had Mrs. Dean's body exhumed last month for chemical analysis.
 At his mother's funeral, Larry Dean laid his hand on her coffin and vowed to find justice, Ms. Jones said. Until he died of cancer in 2001, he collected documents and saved samples of his mother's tissue in his freezer.
 Throughout 1993, despite Mr. Cullen's troubles, Warren Hospital allowed him to keep working. Asked why it did not fire him for harassing a colleague and breaking into her house, Ms. Shea said she was not sure the hospital knew about it.
 ''There's no question his supervisors knew all about it,'' said Bruce Fretz, a detective on the case and now the police chief in Palmer Township, Pa.
 Nor did Warren fire Mr. Cullen after Mrs. Dean died. ''He wasn't charged with anything, and he passed the lie detector,'' Ms. Shea said. When asked if giving an unauthorized injection to someone who was not his patient was sufficient grounds for dismissal, she would not answer.
 Ms. Jones said, ''The hospital just didn't want to take it seriously.''
 Ms. Shea, like Ms. Lally at St. Barnabas, said she could not say what references, if any, the hospital had provided for Mr. Cullen when he went job-hunting. Later employers said they had never learned of his being forced from St. Barnabas, or of his problems at Warren.
 His history now included at least two suicide attempts, a psychiatric commitment, an ouster from a job, a criminal conviction and an allegation of murder.
 He left Warren voluntarily on Dec. 30, 1993, leaving his past in the past, a secret from the rest of the world.

The Nursing Home
Colleague Casts Blame After Insulin Overdose
 Francis J. Henry was rushed away by ambulance, barely alive, on May 8, 1998, and soon the calls came back to Liberty Nursing and Rehabilitation Center demanding to know who had given him insulin.
 The staff at Lehigh Valley Hospital, struggling to save his life, called the nursing home in Allentown, Pa., to ask. His blood sugar level had dropped dangerously low, a sure sign of insulin overdose, yet Mr. Henry, 83 and suffering from multiple ailments, was not supposed to be taking insulin.
 Kimberly Pepe, the nurse caring for Mr. Henry on the overnight shift, insisted to the hospital that she had not given him insulin, and she repeated her denial several times to her own supervisors, according to court papers. But she knew who might have done it, she told them: Charles Cullen, the nurse assigned to Mr. Henry's roommate, who was in that room repeatedly during the night.
 There was more reason to suspect him, she contended. In a lawsuit and in a complaint she later filed with a federal agency, she said that even before Mr. Henry's emergency, Liberty was investigating Mr. Cullen for stealing drugs.
 ''He had equal access to the patient who died,'' Ms. Pepe wrote. ''My record is totally clean and Charles's record, however, was under suspicion for several serious matters.''
 Mr. Cullen's past was more checkered than she knew. After leaving Warren Hospital, he had been fired in August 1997 by another hospital, Morristown Memorial, for what officials there described only as ''poor performance.''
 He was already behind on child support payments and had been propping up his life with credit card debts he could not repay. His firing from Morristown left him unemployed for six months.
 In October 1997, he turned up as a patient in Warren Hospital's emergency room, and from there was admitted again to Greystone, the psychiatric hospital. People with knowledge of the incident said they suspected he had again tried to kill himself.
 In Warren's emergency room, he had a confrontation with a doctor, and he later filed a criminal complaint against him simply for drawing his blood for routine tests.
 In the years he lived alone on Shafer Avenue, where he had a pet ferret, neighbors caught only glimpses of him, sometimes tending a flower bed. He barely spoke to them, but could make strange impressions.
 ''In the middle of the night, he'd be out there chasing after the cats, yelling at them and talking to himself,'' said Brett Everett, who lives next door.
 Pleasant Maynard-Klemka, another next-door neighbor, said, ''When he didn't think you were looking, he'd make weird faces, like he was real angry or thinking really serious.'' He had no friends, ''none at all.''
 Liberty Nursing rescued Mr. Cullen from his unemployment, hiring him on Feb. 10, 1998. Once again seeking out the sickest patients, he went to the ''vent unit,'' for people who needed ventilators to breathe.
 On May 13, just five days after Mr. Henry's mysterious insulin dose, Mr. Cullen filed for bankruptcy, claiming $66,888 in debts, including hospital bills. His possessions amounted to a 1985 Dodge truck, a bicycle, a few books and videotapes.
 Ms. Pepe claimed that at first, her supervisors agreed that Mr. Cullen was probably responsible for Mr. Henry's decline, but that they inexplicably changed their minds. Mr. Henry died on May 19, and Liberty fired Ms. Pepe, but allowed Mr. Cullen to stay.
 Julie Beckert, spokeswoman for HCR Manor Care, which owns Liberty, would not discuss Mr. Henry's case, but she denied that Mr. Cullen had been under investigation for stealing drugs. Liberty settled Ms. Pepe's lawsuit on terms that both sides have kept secret.
 But before long, Liberty could no longer deny that Mr. Cullen was a menace, according to two other nurses there. In October 1998, they said, colleagues saw him entering the room of an elderly woman he was not assigned to, syringes in hand. They said that they did not know precisely what happened, including whether he gave any injections, but that somehow the patient ended up with a broken arm.
 Liberty fired him. Ms. Beckert, the HCR spokeswoman, said only that Mr. Cullen was fired for violating medication protocols.
 Liberty reported that incident to the State Department of Health as a medication error. But neither that case, nor Ms. Pepe's alarming accusations, prompted Liberty to report him to the state police or to the State Board of Nursing.
 Ms. Beckert refused to say how extensively Liberty had inquired into Mr. Cullen's past before hiring him. Two hospitals that say they called Liberty for references on him, though, say it did not pass along its concerns.
 Liberty's apparent reticence was no anomaly. Mr. Cullen's case has exposed a fundamental weakness in health care: the difficulty prospective employers face in trying to learn someone's past troubles.
 Employers frequently refuse to pass on negative information, even about people they have fired, for fear of being sued for slander by the former employee. And state and federal systems for warning employers of bad doctors and nurses are widely regarded as weak. The reporting requirements are so narrowly drawn that it is not clear they would ever have applied to someone like Mr. Cullen. And there are few penalties for hospitals that flout reporting rules.
 ''There needs to be some kind of safe harbor that would allow past employers who've taken adverse actions to share that, and to describe the associated facts, without fear of legal action,'' said Dr. Arnold Milstein, a health care consultant and one of the founders of the Leapfrog Group, a national business alliance dedicated to improving health care.
 Several of the hospitals where Mr. Cullen worked said their policy was not to say anything about a former employer, good or bad. When someone calls for a reference, they give only the person's job title and dates of employment. So Mr. Cullen's career, which now looks so horrific, could have seemed unremarkable to hospitals hiring him.
 When Liberty fired him, he was once again able to move on without word of his misdeeds and personal demons following him. It was his fifth nursing job and the third time he was forced out the door, he had survived multiple suicide attempts and psychiatric commitments, and he had twice been linked to patient deaths.
 He was, apparently, just warming up.

The Coroner
A Long Inquiry, But No Results
 The man handling Ottomar Schramm's intravenous tube at Easton Hospital in Pennsylvania said he was giving Mr. Schramm something to keep his heart beating. Even five years ago, when she first gave that account to investigators, Mr. Schramm's daughter, Kristina Toth, found the words chilling.
 That night, Mr. Schramm, 78, ''crashed,'' and early the next morning, Dec. 31, 1998, his heart did stop, forever. Ms. Toth said the same man had advised her against an autopsy. After seeing images of Mr. Cullen since his arrest, she is convinced he was that man.
 ''Do I think he was murdered?'' she asked recently. ''I think I do.''
 From the beginning, it was obvious that something had gone desperately wrong in that hospital room. Shortly before he died, a blood test showed that Mr. Schramm, a retired Bethlehem Steel worker, had a potentially lethal amount of digoxin in his system. But for Mr. Schramm, who had entered the hospital just two days earlier after a seizure, digoxin was off-limits because he had a pacemaker.
 Zachary Lysek, the Northampton County coroner, investigated the death for eight months. He said he had never considered it accidental. An autopsy listed digoxin as a factor contributing to Mr. Schramm's death.
 Yet Mr. Lysek never asked the district attorney's office to open a criminal inquiry. Ms. Toth told him of the mysterious man in her father's room, yet in those eight months, Mr. Lysek never learned Mr. Cullen's name.
 Mr. Cullen went to Easton in early November 1998; it had taken him less than a week to find work after being fired by Liberty.
 More than three years later, someone working with Mr. Cullen at another hospital -- Mr. Lysek will not say who -- called to tell him that Charles Cullen was involved in Mr. Schramm's death, and the coroner contacted the state police. But no one checked his background to learn of allegations linking him to patient deaths at Liberty and Warren.
 No one saw enough of the dots to begin connecting them.
 Mr. Lysek said that when he had gotten the tip, he called an Easton administrator, but was told that no Charles Cullen had worked there. Investigators say the hospital contends that it misled the coroner accidentally, because Mr. Cullen was not a hospital employee, but rather worked there through a personnel agency, Health Med One of Harrisburg. The owner of Health Med One at the time, William P. Gula, declined to answer questions about Mr. Cullen.
 Days before Mr. Schramm's death, Mr. Cullen began working part time at Lehigh Valley Hospital. In March 1999, he left Easton and worked at Lehigh Valley full time, mostly in the burn ward. His time there was uneventful, according to hospital officials and government investigators.
 His personal turmoil, though, continued.
 On Jan 2, 2000, an overpowering smell like kerosene filled Karin Ziemba's apartment directly above Mr. Cullen's. She eventually called the police. Officers found Mr. Cullen inside, with insulation stuffed into air vents, batteries removed from smoke alarms, and a charcoal grill smoldering away in his bathtub. It was apparently an attempt to kill himself by filling the apartment with carbon monoxide gas.
 The police took him to a psychological crisis center and then to a hospital for observation, but by the next day, he was home again. Brian Downs, a spokesman for Lehigh Valley, said hospital officials had never known of the attempt. Mr. Cullen worked there until April 28, 2000, when Mr. Downs said he left voluntarily.
 He had gone through seven jobs, had been forced out of three, had survived at least three or four suicide attempts, had endured four psychiatric hospitalizations, and had evaded three investigations into suspicious deaths. Finding work, though, remained easy.

The State Police
A New Investigation Also Proves Fruitless
 When the Pennsylvania State Police arrived at St. Luke's Hospital in August 2002, they were met by angry and worried nurses. The nurses, after persuading the police to come, told investigators that a former colleague had been found mishandling medication, and that they suspected he might have played a role in the deaths of patients at the hospital, just outside Bethlehem.
 Worse, they feared that the hospital was not interested in investigating, and had allowed the nurse to quit and take up at another hospital.
 That nurse was Charles Cullen, who had arrived at St. Luke's two years before.
 ''All of a sudden, the nurses who worked with him were talking about a number of suspicious deaths that they thought he might have had something to do with,'' said Capt. Scott Snyder of the state police. ''Things escalated very quickly.''
 Finally, it looked as if Mr. Cullen might now be seriously investigated. A major law enforcement agency was on the case.
 But again, the inquiry fell short.
 The nurses pieced together Mr. Cullen's history at St. Luke's, and told the police of his assorted peculiarities, and the alarming suspicions he had aroused.
 Mr. Cullen had been hired in the coronary care unit at St. Luke's in June 2000, and while he quickly established a reputation as an oddity, his disciplinary record remained spotless for two years.
 Then in June 2002, a nurse on the unit opened a disposal container for dirty syringes and found vials of unused drugs: procainamide, to treat arrhythmia, and sodium nitroprusside for high blood pressure. The nurse reported the incident to hospital officials. The next day, another collection of medication was discovered in a container.
 Hospital officials quickly concluded that Mr. Cullen was to blame and took him off duty, but he refused to answer their questions and resigned within a week.
 The circumstances of Mr. Cullen's departure led some nurses to ask questions: Why would someone steal medications that were not used recreationally and would have little street value? Why did it seem that more patients died during the shifts when Mr. Cullen was on duty?
 The nurses reported their concerns to hospital administrators. Ultimately one of the nurses called the state police, reporting only the missing medication, but insisting that detectives come to the hospital to investigate.
 Because the detectives lacked the expertise to interpret the medical records, they contracted a private medical expert. Dr. Mihalakis, the same forensic pathologist who was involved in the investigation of Helen Dean's death at Warren Hospital years earlier, was hired to review the case files of 69 St. Luke's patients who had died on Mr. Cullen's wards. Dr. Mihalakis spent months reviewing the files, but could establish no pattern.
 ''Nothing prosecutable,'' said Captain Snyder of the state police.
 But it appears that the police never seriously scrutinized Mr. Cullen's nursing history. They never at that time learned that Mr. Cullen had been accused of murder at Warren Hospital and of a deadly mistake, at least, at Liberty.
 The final chance that his full history might be learned, and action taken, died when the State Board of Nursing, acting on information from the state police, sent an investigator to St. Luke's. He showed up at the hospital, but never recommended having a formal hearing.
 Mr. Cullen moved along, working for 16 days at Sacred Heart Hospital in Allentown before being fired for his failure to get along with nurses, and then moving back to New Jersey and its hospitals. A severe nursing shortage meant that only criminal charges or a penalty from the state nursing board could keep him on the sidelines for long.
 As he sought work again in New Jersey, his nursing licenses intact, his professional life now had these milestones: being forced out of five jobs and being linked to deaths in four places.
 He was hired barely a month later by Somerset Medical Center in Somerville, N.J., where prosecutors say he carried out his deadliest work.

The Last Job
Mounting Evidence Finally Leads to Arrest
 By June 2003, it was clear that Mr. Cullen was up to something at Somerset Medical Center. The hospital's computers had all but caught him red-handed.
 On the morning of June 16, a cancer patient in the critical care unit suffered a sudden, life-threatening heart malfunction. Her blood tests showed high levels of digoxin, a drug she had not been prescribed. She recovered from the incident but died three months later.
 There were signs pointing to Mr. Cullen. One of the hospital's computer systems showed that during Mr. Cullen's shift the previous night, he had called up medical files for the woman, Jin Kyung Han, even though she was not his patient. A computerized drug-dispensing cabinet, the Pyxis system, also indicated that in the hours before Ms. Han's heart malfunctioned, Mr. Cullen had ordered a dose of digoxin for another patient, who was not prescribed the drug.
 Even before Ms. Han's heart malfunction, there had been a series of suspicious medication errors at Somerset. From May 28 to June 4, two patients suffered life-threatening drops in blood sugar that could only have been caused by an insulin overdose.
 But at the time, hospital officials did not make a connection between Mr. Cullen and Ms. Han's digoxin levels. Dr. William K. Cors, director of medicine, said abnormal digoxin readings and indications that nurses took the incorrect medications were everyday occurrences. ''The information we were receiving concurrently really didn't stick out like a sore thumb and say, 'Charles Cullen is a problem,''' Dr. Cors said.
 Despite a state expert's suggestion that the poisonings might be intentional, the hospital wanted to begin by ruling out a more benign explanation: Ms. Han had been known to drink an herbal tea, which might have caused an increase in her digoxin level. So they sent a sample of the tea to be analyzed by the New Jersey Poison Information and Education System. Rather than suspending or reassigning Mr. Cullen, the hospital allowed him to continue working in the critical care unit.
 In the weeks that followed, Mr. Cullen was occasionally seen in the room of the Rev. Florian J. Gall, 68, a Roman Catholic priest with pneumonia. Father Gall's sister, Lucille, said she specifically remembered that Mr. Cullen was on the unit during her visit the night of June 27.
 ''He was quiet,'' she said of Mr. Cullen. ''Didn't make a lot of eye contact. I never thought much about him.''
 But hospital records show that Mr. Cullen had reviewed Father Gall's medical records on the night of June 27, even though the priest was not his patient. Later that night, Mr. Cullen ordered a dose of digoxin for another patient who had not been prescribed the drug.
 About 9 a.m. the next day, Ms. Gall got a call from doctors. She arrived at the hospital minutes before Father Gall died of heart failure.
 Lab tests showed that Father Gall's blood had toxic levels of digoxin, a medication he was not scheduled to receive. But his death certificate listed the cause of death as an abnormal heart rhythm and excess potassium -- two well-known results of digoxin poisoning -- without ever mentioning the drug. Lucille Gall said Somerset doctors also failed to tell her about his digoxin level, and she decided not to request an autopsy.
 Faced with their fourth incident in a month, Somerset officials now intensified their investigation. On July 1, hospital officials brought in outside experts, according to a spokeswoman. But the hospital did not report the incidents to the State Health Department or to the police and allowed Mr. Cullen to remain on duty.
 Nine days later, when Somerset's administrators discussed Ms. Han's case with Dr. Steven Marcus, executive director of the New Jersey poison control center, the conversation quickly grew heated. Hospital officials wanted to discuss whether the tea might have caused her high digoxin level. But Dr. Marcus was startled by the pattern of overdoses, and stunned that hospital officials seemed reluctant to consider the possibility that the poisonings might have been malicious.
 Dr. Marcus, according to records, told hospital officials that he intended to report the case to the Department of Health and Senior Services. He also told the administrators that he had been taping their discussion.
 Later that day, Somerset notified state officials that it had experienced ''four abnormal lab values'' involving patients, but did not report the computer evidence linking Mr. Cullen to the two digoxin overdoses.
 Dr. Marcus sent an e-mail message to the state the same day, saying he was concerned. ''They told me they were not planning on reporting these incidents to anyone -- not the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services or the police, until they mount a thorough investigation,'' Dr. Marcus wrote of Somerset.
 State health officials responded by dispatching a team of researchers to the hospital to test the lab equipment, but allowed Somerset to continue its investigation.
 At Somerset, Mr. Cullen was allowed to remain in the critical care unit as the hospital's inquiry continued, even after another patient on the ward apparently suffered a nonfatal insulin overdose on Aug. 27. On Sept. 25, when the Department of Health learned that the hospital had not reported that incident, state officials grew ''concerned,'' according to Dr. Clifton R. Lacy, state health commissioner. State health officials penalized Somerset for failing to report the incident, but still allowed the hospital to continue its internal inquiry.
 Eight days later, yet another patient suffered a precipitous drop in blood sugar. The patient died 45 minutes later, and although doctors said they do not believe the death was related to the previous cases, Somerset administrators notified both the county prosecutor and state health officials.
 Once the investigation became a criminal matter, the case moved with a new sense of urgency, 16 years after Mr. Cullen started work as a nurse and years after he says he began killing people. The Somerset County prosecutor, Wayne J. Forrest, immediately started a review of hospital records and began interviewing witnesses. In mid-October, investigators told Lucille Gall for the first time about the digoxin. Ms. Gall, a registered nurse, was outraged.
 ''Well then,'' Ms. Gall said she replied. ''Somebody killed him.''
 Somerset hospital officials combed through Mr. Cullen's personnel file and on Oct. 31 fired him for lying on his job application.
 Prosecutors kept close watch over Mr. Cullen in the following weeks, as they rounded up the evidence needed to file criminal charges. Finally, on Dec. 12, the authorities surrounded Mr. Cullen as he and a date sat eating spring rolls and drinking beer at a restaurant in Somerville.
 Mr. Cullen would soon tell the authorities an astounding story of his 16 years as both caregiver and killer: claiming to have fatally poisoned 12 to 15 patients at Somerset, at least half a dozen at St. Luke's and 10 to 20 at other stops.
 When he was arrested, Mr. Cullen went quietly.
 His nursing licenses were in order. He was, in theory, ready to be hired somewhere.

HEADLINE: When It Comes to Salary, Many Women Don't Push

BYLINE: By ABBY ELLIN. 
Abby Ellin is a Manhattan writer. Her column on starting out in the world of money appears each month. E-mail: preludes@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
ARE young professional women as assertive as their male colleagues when it comes to salary negotiations? Many of them will at least say they are.
 Nearly all the women in their 20's who were interviewed for ''Women Don't Ask: Negotiation and the Gender Divide'' (Princeton University Press, 2003) said that their negotiating skills had set them apart from older generations of working women. ''They all said, 'We identify what we want, we go after it, we ask for as much money as our peers,''' said Sara Laschever, a freelance writer and co-author of the book with Linda Babcock, an economics professor at Carnegie Mellon University.
 The book concludes, however, that women of all ages were far less likely than men to initiate salary negotiations and that they were too often willing to accept whatever was offered by their employers or prospective employers. In fact, a year before the book was published, Professor Babcock conducted a study of 37 recent Carnegie Mellon graduates who had master's degrees. Only 7 percent of the women in the survey said they had negotiated their salaries, compared with 57 percent of the men. 
 ''Those who did negotiate were able to raise their salaries by $4,053, on average,'' Ms. Laschever said. ''The average difference between men's and women's starting salaries was about $4,000, which suggests that women might have closed or approached closing the gender gap if they had negotiated.''
 A 2003 study of 38 business students by Lisa A. Barron, an assistant professor of organizational behavior at the Graduate School of Management at the University of California at Irvine, yielded similar results. Professor Barron asked both men and women whether they thought they were entitled to salaries that were higher or just equal to those of other applicants for the same jobs. About 70 percent of the men said they believed they were entitled to more money than other applicants. Conversely, 70 percent of the women indicated that they were entitled to a salary equal to that of other candidates. In follow-up interviews, Professor Barron discovered that 85 percent of the men, but only 17 percent of the women, felt that it was up to them to make sure the company paid them what they were worth; the rest felt that their worth would be determined by what the company paid them. 
 Why the reluctance to ask for more? Ms. Laschever said that women tended to believe ''that hard work and good work will be rewarded'' without asking.
 ''Women have also been taught not to be too bossy and too aggressive, and that makes them think they need to wait for someone else to tell them if they deserve more rather than thinking they can have some control over it,'' she added.
 Some of the women I interviewed seemed to feel that way. 
 ''I think a lot of women are afraid to admit that they're not as good negotiators as men,'' said Lisa Lake, 30, who works in the financial industry in Palo Alto, Calif. She said she was often reluctant to be too forceful when negotiating salary, or anything else for that matter, because ''I don't want to step on anyone's toes, or be too pushy.'' 
 Jocelyn Frank, 22, who works at an independent bookseller in Ann Arbor, Mich., agreed. ''It's uncomfortable to have to say, 'This is what I'm worth,''' she said. Once you are offered a position, she added, you ''don't want to rock the boat.''
 Career experts say women can be as successful as men in negotiations. But before any deal can be struck, you have to believe you're worth the amount you seek. 
 How to determine that market value? Research. Find out what the going rate is for the job you want or already have. Web sites like salary.com can help: simply type in your industry, experience level and ZIP code and you will receive a range of pay for jobs in your region. ''This way, you can feel comfortable asking for X rather than thinking, 'I just need to be grateful for what they give me,''' Ms. Laschever said.
 MOLLY SCOTT, 29, a fitness trainer in Seattle, said she learned over the years to prepare for any kind of business deal -- even negotiating with her father about her wedding. ''I had to approach him like it was a business meeting,'' she recalled. ''I made an Excel spreadsheet and researched four different florists, caterers, bands and venues to show him that the prices were real. All of my ducks had to line up in a row before he would even consider listening to me.'' (Her efforts have paid off: she says she is getting the wedding of her dreams this fall.) 
 Career experts say it is important to be persistent. ''If someone says no, don't say, 'O.K.' Say, 'Well, how close can you come to my offer?''' said Alan Bernstein, a Manhattan psychotherapist who counsels young adults about career changes. '''Can we talk about it to figure out a way for us both to be happy?' That last approach works well for women -- 'let's make this relationship about pleasing both of us.'''

HEADLINE: How a Stronger Yuan Could Hurt the U.S.

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
FROM all the attention given to the Chinese yuan in recent months, it would seem that the currency is a major threat to American prosperity.
 American manufacturers have railed for months against the yuan's peg to the dollar. They contend that a cheap currency gives Chinese exporters unfair advantage, contributing to the $124 billion bilateral trade deficit and threatening American jobs.
 Adding official gravitas to the complaint, Treasury Secretary John W. Snow even threatened to hold China's ''feet to the fire'' if it did not relax the yuan's decade-long peg of 8.28 to the dollar and let it float higher. Last week, he sent a delegation to Beijing to convey the point to authorities there. 
 Despite the heated words, it is not clear that making China jack up the yuan would be in the best interest of the United States. 
 A nominal appreciation of the yuan would do little to change the international competitiveness of Chinese producers. Barry P. Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington, said that a rising yuan would reduce prices of imported goods in China, cool Chinese inflation and thus restore the currency's competitive edge. 
 In fact, China's global trade is in better balance than that of the United States. Its current account surplus -- the broad trade in goods and services, as well as interest payments -- is equivalent to only about 1.5 percent of its total gross domestic product. The current account deficit of the United States amounts to about 5 percent of G.D.P. 
 But neither gap can be closed by just tinkering with the bilateral exchange rate. China has a surplus because it saves a lot and spends little. The United States, on the other hand, spends beyond its means. ''Changing an exchange rate does not change these net savings propensities in any obvious ways,'' Ronald I. McKinnon, an economist at Stanford, wrote in an academic paper last summer.
 A change in foreign exchange policy, though, could lead China and other Asian countries to channel less money into the United States, which could push interest rates higher and eventually force Americans to change their spending habits.
 China keeps the yuan's exchange rate low against the dollar by printing money to buy dollar-denominated securities. If it were to float the yuan, it would need to buy less. And if neighbors like Japan, South Korea and Taiwan shadowed the move and let their currencies also rise against the dollar, as many economists expect, they could put a collective brake on the United States' extraordinary access to foreign money.
 According to the Treasury Department, foreigners plowed a record $744 billion into American securities of all sorts in 2003, up from $548 billion the previous year. 
 The government used much of that to pay for its budget deficit. Foreigners now hold about 40 percent of outstanding American Treasury securities. And nearly 60 percent of the foreign flows last year were channeled into Treasuries and other government agency bonds. 
 ASIA provided a substantial amount of that cash. Last year, China's foreign exchange reserves grew by $160 billion as the central bank tried to mop up the flood of investment from abroad and keep a lid on the exchange rate. Then the Chinese turned around and spent more than $60 billion of this to buy United States Treasury and other government bonds. 
 Other Asian countries followed suit. Japan alone funneled $171 billion into Treasuries and other United States government securities last year as it intervened to hold down the yen. Taiwan bought $18 billion worth of United States government paper. South Korea bought $14 billion. In the last two years, money flows from Asian countries into American government securities covered two-thirds of the $650 billion growth in the public debt of the United States. 
 If they stopped, it would probably hurt. ''It's hard to buy the argument that a retrenchment by foreign central banks would not have an impact on Treasury yields,'' said Rebecca McCaughrin, an economist at Morgan Stanley.
 Of course, a shift in exchange rates across Asia would not cut off all Asian money flows to the United States. Not all of the Asian financing is prompted by central banks intervening in foreign exchange markets. Some of the money comes from private investors. And central banks would still have to intervene to maintain a new foreign exchange peg.
 Jim O'Neill, chief economist of Goldman Sachs, said he thought China and other Asian countries had already shifted a big part of their reserves out of the dollar -- perhaps preparing for a currency realignment -- and could thus change their exchange rate without causing much stress to interest rates in the United States.
 But as the rhetoric against China's foreign exchange arrangements has escalated, investors are growing wary. ''When I speak to clients around the world it is invariably the first or second question they ask,'' Mr. O'Neill said. ''A lot of people out there are very bearish about U.S. bonds. This is another reason to worry.''

HEADLINE: In Zimbabwe, Even the Farmers Are Going Hungry

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

DATELINE: MARONDERA, Zimbabwe 

 BODY:
The grasslands surrounding Harare, the capital, are blessed with rich soil, good drainage and a temperate climate that comes from sitting a half mile above sea level. Amon Zimbudzana raises corn on four acres of it.
 Yet on a recent morning, he walked the mile from his thatched hut to a clearing in the bush here to collect sacks of free corn for his family from international relief workers. Mr. Zimbudzana is destitute -- so destitute that the family celebrated the New Year with a 20-cent pack of Zimbabwean Kool Aid; so destitute that two children are unable to attend school for lack of the $6 tuition; so destitute that he cannot buy food to tide his family over until his own harvest, in April.
 Soon after the harvest, he will be destitute again. He expects to harvest about 100 pounds of corn, enough to last about two weeks. 
 ''This is prime farmland,'' one relief worker said as Mr. Zimbudzana and 900 others waited to collect their sacks. ''If people are suffering here, imagine what it must be like in other parts of the country.''
 One need not imagine. As January ended, the United Nations and other relief agencies here quietly raised their estimate of Zimbabwe's ''food insecure'' population -- essentially, those who have no ready access to a bare-bones daily diet -- from nearly half its 11.6 million citizens to two-thirds.
 No other nation in Africa has such a high proportion of hungry citizens, the officials say. It is one more testament to the three years of economic and social disintegration here.
 Zimbabwe's farm output -- and in particular, its harvest of corn, the core of every diet -- is plummeting. Last year's April harvest totaled 900,000 tons, nearly a million tons short of what was needed. This year, crippled by inflation and seed shortages, farmers planted barely three-fourths of the corn sown in 2003.
 The Famine Early Warning System, an American-financed hunger watchdog, said in mid-February that recent heavier rains could erase some of that deficit. But even the most sanguine harvest forecasts leave Zimbabwe 40 percent short of its needs.
 ''The harvest is causing us great concern,'' said Makena Walker, a spokeswoman for the United Nations World Food Program in Harare. ''The rains have been very patchy,'' she added, and some of the areas that are worst off are those that produce the food.
 Two years of drought are partly to blame for the food shortages. Most experts say, however, that more responsibility rests with President Robert Mugabe's government, whose seizure of commercial farms in recent years has destroyed large-scale agriculture, sent foreign investors fleeing and caused economic panic.
 The resulting hyperinflation, pegged lately at 620 percent, has savaged family food budgets. One unpublished survey by relief organizations found that 9 in 10 urban households now survive on the equivalent of less than a dollar per person per day.
 The effect is not the kind of famine that Sudan and Ethiopia suffered in the 1980's. Rather, Zimbabweans are slowly wasting away from chronic hunger and the diseases that feed on it.
 Half the children under age 5 suffer from chronic malnutrition, the United Nations Children's Fund says, double the percentage of just five years ago. One in four children is stunted. At least 1 woman in 10 is malnourished.
 Zimbabwe's AIDS pandemic -- at least one in four people is H.I.V.-positive -- works in synergy with such deprivation, for the weak and underfed are often the first to fall ill. In interviews in Harare and elsewhere, health experts said that as many as 8 in 10 malnourished children brought to clinics and hospitals for emergency nutritional treatment were H.I.V.-positive.
 ''Normally,'' said one expert, ''if you're treating kids under 5 with a therapeutic feeding program for malnutrition, your mortality is less than 5 percent. In theory, they should walk away with their parents after a couple of weeks. Instead, we're getting mortality rates between 20 and 30 percent.''
 The need is evident in Marondera, with about 4,100 people, where Mr. Zimbudzana lives, and its surrounding district 60 miles southeast of Harare. By Zimbabwean standards it is relatively prosperous: fewer than one in three is officially classified as scrambling for the next meal.
 But by 10 a.m. on a Thursday morning in January, people were streaming to the corn-distribution center, knots of donkey carts and barefoot pedestrians following a yellow dirt road through the scrub to a grassy clearing where hundreds already patiently waited.
 The reward for most, this month, was 10 kilograms -- 22 pounds -- per person of ground corn, to be boiled with water and a few vegetables to make sadza, the national staple. The World Food Program had halved that allotment for December, citing a slowdown in donations from governments apparently wary of appearing to assist Zimbabwe's government. The rations of ground nuts and vegetable oil the needy once also received have been suspended for lack of stocks. The neediest of all get an extra dollop of high-protein corn and soy flour. Mr. Zimbudzana and his wife, Gertrude Chokurongwera, were among them.
 Mr. Zimbudzana is unemployed -- hobbled, he says, by a slow-moving prostate cancer that he is too poor to treat. He and his wife nevertheless have taken in four children, two from a relative's broken marriage; two orphaned by a mother's AIDS. 
 They live in three tiny huts next to his cornfields and a handful of peach trees, surviving on donations from World Vision and the World Food Program, the few bottlefish he catches in a nearby stream and whatever they can earn from begging and selling possessions.
 ''Sometimes,'' Ms. Chokurongwera said, ''we sell our clothes.'' Sometimes neighbors give the family food, Mr. Zimbudzana said, but not often. ''We're all the same,'' he said during a chat in the hut that serves as the family kitchen. ''There's no food.''
 The last two harvests, like the forthcoming one, were tiny. Drought was one problem, but Mr. Zimbudzana is also too poor to buy fertilizer, which has skyrocketed in price as the country's ability to buy raw materials for farming has imploded. He tills his plot with a hoe.
 The daily diet for the household is sadza in the morning and again in the evening, mixed occasionally with some okra or one of the 16 scrawny chickens he has raised. There is tea in good times, but no sugar, and there is no cow, so no milk.
 Ms. Chokurongwera said the family would be in dire straits without the relief agencies. ''Now, at least, the children's health is improving because of the corn-soya blend.'' she said. ''They were so lean before. Even my husband and myself are gaining some weight now.''
 Mr. Mugabe's government blames a conspiracy of what he calls racist Western governments for Zimbabwe's food woes. Yet today, all that separates this nation from starvation is the donated corn, sorghum and high-protein soy flour, 80 percent of it from Europe and the United States, funneled through the United Nations and global charities. It is not enough.
 World Food Program officials say their workers and global charities will be able to feed only about 5.5 million Zimbabweans until the harvest comes in. That is 2 million fewer than the number in need.
 It was disclosed recently that Zimbabwe, which had restricted those aid programs to the governing party's rural strongholds, was holding more than 300,000 tons of grain. Most of it had been seized from farmers trying to sell it on the black market because government-set prices were too low to recover their costs.
 Under international pressure, officials said they would release some of it to address hunger in cities.

HEADLINE: The Promise and Cost Of Health Care

 BODY:

To the Editor:
 Daniel Gross correctly ends his column, ''Whose Problem is Health Care?'' (Economic View, Feb. 8) with this statement: ''Whatever way, we all pay.'' And, indeed, the problem is us. 
 People are focusing only on who pays for health care -- employers, government or consumers -- without addressing the core issue. 
 Consider cancer. The costs that are associated with diagnosis, treatment and convalescence run into billions of dollars. Yet there are many available ways to reduce cancer risk, so the future could be much brighter. 
 The major solution to health care is all around us. It just must become a priority, an investment objective, for each one of us and for our society as a whole.

HEADLINE: Method

BYLINE: By Rob Walker

 BODY:
If you have never given much thought to the aesthetic qualities of your dish soap, you are not alone. What's a little more surprising is that a person who has given a lot of thought to this subject would not be alone, either. Two people in this category are Eric Ryan and Adam Lowry. Three years ago they launched Method, a brand of home-cleaning products -- dish soap, spray cleaners, hand wash and so on -- in one shop in San Francisco. Today Method is available in thousands of stores from coast to coast, including the chains Target and Linens 'n Things. The most noticeable thing about Method products, and their chief selling point, is that they look really cool. 
 Who cares, right? It's dish soap, for crying out loud -- it gets stuffed under the sink between the rusty Brillo pads and the boric acid. 
 That defeatist attitude is exactly what Ryan and Lowry set out to change. Ryan, who is 31 and a former marketer who had done work for the Gap, Saturn and other brands, was appalled at the mundane state of home-care products in general. We obviously take a great interest in the places we live, he says, and yet, ''When you walk down the aisle dedicated to products to take care of your home, it's one of the most low-interest categories in the world.''
 True enough, and perhaps a powerful cue to toss a Palmolive in the shopping cart and get on with your life, but Ryan saw an opportunity. What if you could do something different with home-care products? Soon he was working with his friend Lowry, 29, a chemical engineer, creating sprays and soaps that were environmentally safe, smelled good and -- crucially -- came in packaging that looked so striking it practically demanded to be left out in the open. Before making the leap to national stores, they brought in the celebrated designer Karim Rashid, who among other things had created a hit trash can sold at Target. Rashid came up with a design for a dish-soap container that squirts from the bottom through a clever nonleaking spout. Clear, filled with different, colorful soaps and shaped like an hourglass, the bottle looks like a sculpture and won a design-distinction award from the magazine I.D. It also looks disconcertingly large, underscoring its status as a proud object to be admired, not shamefully hidden away. 
 Form preceded function. ''Design is a fast way to make these products more high interest,'' Ryan says, to the target audience of ''progressive domestics.'' Environmental safety was ''a goal,'' one that he still sounds almost surprised to have achieved. But form is what really sells some $10 million of the stuff annually. Much of the feedback from enthusiastic customers boils down to: ''I kind of thought it wouldn't work, but at least I'll have this cool container left over. Then I got it home and used it, and I'm shocked at how well it actually works.''
 One reaction to this is to wonder why somebody would buy a cleaning product that they were frankly skeptical about simply because of its container. Perhaps this is more evidence of the endless craving for status symbols, or of how cunning design seduces and manipulates us. But those explanations seem too easy. Virginia Postrel, an economics writer, does not address Method specifically in her recent book ''The Substance of Style,'' but her thesis provides useful context. Praising aesthetic pleasure as a legitimate value, she observes that the more we see style, the more we recognize it and want it in our lives. Ugliness stands out, she writes, so ''we demand better design.'' Later she asserts, ''Aesthetic proliferation gives us more choices, opportunities and responsibility than ever before.''
 It's the responsibility bit that gives you pause. Method products raise the possibility that, stylistically speaking, your dish liquid is not measuring up. Which is, frankly, annoying: must even the most mundane household object rise up and join the tyranny of Good Design? Ryan seems puzzled by this line of questioning. ''It just makes you get enjoyment out of an object that you never expected to get enjoyment from, because it makes you smile when you look at it, or it's fun to touch,'' he says politely. ''So it's not that it just looks beautiful, but when you actually interact with it, it makes a chore a little less of a chore. Who wouldn't want that?''

HEADLINE: The Pull of Family

BYLINE: By James Traub. 
James Traub is a contributing writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
I am an affirmative-action baby. My SAT scores, grade-point average and nonexistent record of extracurricular activities would not have gained me admission to Harvard back in 1972 were it not for what William Fitzsimmons, Harvard's current director of admissions, has delicately described as the ''ever so slight tip'' traditionally granted to children of alumni. 
 I don't recall experiencing any stigma, and I certainly didn't feel that I deserved my diploma any less than all those physics geniuses admitted strictly on the basis of their intellect. In fact, I never thought of myself as the beneficiary of any special treatment until the recent debate over ''legacy admissions.'' And now Texas A&M has abolished the practice. After announcing in December that the school would not restore its affirmative-action program, Robert Gates, president of the university, said last month that he would also end preferences for legacies because they create ''an obvious inconsistency in an admissions strategy based on individual merit.'' I have to admit he has a point there. 
 Legacies are one of those quiet institutional prerogatives that can't help looking bad once exposed to public scrutiny. The Economist magazine, no enemy of privilege, has noted the oddity of ''the most politically correct places on the planet . . . pandering to the (overwhelmingly white) children of the overclass.'' A campaign against legacies has obvious political appeal -- especially if your opponent is a legatee like George W. Bush; John Edwards has lampooned the practice as ''a birthright out of 18th-century British aristocracy, not 21st-century American democracy.'' Senator Edward Kennedy, who himself may have needed more than an ever so slight tip to get into Harvard, has introduced legislation requiring colleges to disclose the race and economic background of their legacy admissions. 
 Legacies hark back to an era when the elite university belonged to a network of institutions (the prep school, the military, the Episcopal Church) devoted to the intergenerational transfer of the manly virtues -- stoicism, sacrifice, loyalty, a tight spiral on the forward pass. They seem out of place in our fiercely competitive culture, which promises to reward ''merit.'' But universities defend legacies on the grounds that having second- or third-generation kids on campus helps build a sense of continuity and tradition; that the slight tip to their children keeps alumni donors happy; and that, in any case, it's nobody's business but their own. 
 Unlike Texas A&M, most universities want both affirmative action and legacy admissions. Senator Edwards, by contrast, supports affirmative action but argues that legacy admissions violate a public good so fundamental -- equal opportunity -- that universities should voluntarily get rid of the practice no matter what institutional benefit it confers. Affirmative action is good social engineering, while legacy admission is bad social engineering. Of course, legacies were never intended to be any form of social engineering; but universities have become such powerful forces that even their private choices now have to be able to withstand public scrutiny.
 The question, then, is what are we to make of these two forms of preference in light of each other? A thumb on the scale in favor of the historically excluded is obviously morally preferable to a thumb on the scale in favor of the fortunate. On the other hand, the magnitude of the advantage is very different in the two cases. At the University of Michigan, according to evidence submitted in the recent Supreme Court case Gratz v. Bollinger, minority applicants to the undergraduate school were receiving a 20-point boost on a 150-point scale, while legacies got no more than a 4-point bonus. People like Senator Edwards are thus defending a big intrusion on meritocratic principles and opposing a small one.
 You could make the case in favor of affirmative action, and against legacy preferences, if you felt that college admissions offices should concern themselves as much with expanding opportunity as with rewarding academic merit. This is a serious argument, but it would be more persuasive if admissions offices based their preferences on actual disadvantage, not skin color. As for the opposite case, maybe there's some rationale that would justify giving a break to me but not to a black or Hispanic kid, but I wouldn't want to recite it in a crowded bar. 
 So which is it to be -- no to legacies and affirmative action, or yes to both? My own preference would be no to both. A place at an elite university has become so precious a commodity that even a slight tip for the already fortunate feels as un-American as, say, the Republican campaign to repeal the estate tax. And while increasing minority enrollment in the best schools is highly desirable, I would rather see it accomplished through outreach, recruitment and admissions policies sensitive to disadvantage rather than race. 
 But I also know what will happen. Both practices will flourish, because the marketplace will demand it. When development offices tabulate the millions of dollars in lost alumni gifts that a no-legacy policy is likely to cost, even the boldest meritocrats at the helms of universities will have second thoughts. Meanwhile, the political marketplace will insist that places be guaranteed to minority students. When affirmative action was eliminated in California and Texas, state legislatures devised new, hypothetically race-blind systems that have largely restored the prior numbers of minority students (except at the most selective schools in California). And now that the Supreme Court has reaffirmed its support for affirmative action, the University of Texas, which had abandoned the policy under court order, has begun to explore ways of restoring it. 
 Affirmative action has long been a handy punching bag for the right, and legacies may now become a handy punching bag for the left. And they'll both always be there. No matter how hard you hit them, they're bound to pop back up.


GRAPHIC: Photo (Photograph by Paul Schutzer/Time Life Pictures/Getty Images)Chart: ''MAKING IT''''The overall admission rate for legacies was almost twice that for all other candidates and roughly the same as the overall rate for black candidates. However . . . a different picture is obtained when we take SAT scores into account. In the 1100-to-1199 SAT range, for example, 22 percent of all legacies were accepted, as compared with 18 percent of all other white candidates (and roughly 40 percent of all black candidates). The legacy 'advantage' widens in the 1200-to-1299 SAT band . . . and is most pronounced in the 1300-and-over SAT band (where 60 percent of legacies are admitted, as compared with 24 percent of nonlegacies and 70 percent of black candidates).''

HEADLINE: In Alaska, Help for Logging Comes Late

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

DATELINE: KETCHIKAN, Alaska 

 BODY:
This town of 7,500 people, clinging to tide-swept black rocks near the bottom of the southeastern archipelago of this state, still sees its future in its past. Jilted by the timber industry that was a central part of the economy for 40 years, many people in this town and other former timber centers in the region believe that the bays will be paved with logs again, and that the 2,000 missing jobs will return.
 The Bush administration recently stoked their hopes, and infuriated environmentalists, by opening 330,000 acres of the Tongass National Forest, old-growth rain forest and marshland the size of West Virginia, to logging roads.
 In a classic struggle between jobs and the environment, the government has tilted the balance in favor of jobs, citing as a reason for its decision ''the severe effect on the social and economic fabric of life in southeast Alaska from the decline in the timber industry.'' 
 But few of those involved, certainly not federal or state officials, bother to say that the traditional debate is now almost beside the point. Global timber markets have undergone fundamental shifts. There is a worldwide timber glut. Logging costs in this region are historically much higher than in other parts of the world, making profits elusive at best.
 Economists and others who study the Northwest timber industry say they doubt that companies returning to the Tongass's stands of old-growth hemlock, cedar and spruce trees will find buyers willing to pay enough to keep local loggers in business.
 Gov. Frank H. Murkowski, a Republican, told reporters in December that the rule change, announced that month, was ''a vital step in our plan to rebuild the southeast timber industry.'' 
 But Brian Zak, president of the Coast Forest and Lumber Association, an industry group in neighboring British Columbia, offered a more stark assessment in a recent interview, saying, ''Any time you lose market share, it's nigh impossible to get it back.''
 Scott Fitzwilliams, a federal Forest Service employee who spent the last three years in Sitka, northwest of Ketchikan, said that the debate over logging in the Tongass always had more to do with emotion than economic reality. For opponents of logging, the Tongass has a strong emotional pull as a remnant of the primeval immensity of the North American wilderness.
 ''I really believe it gets down to the real or created vision of the last of the last great places,'' Mr. Fitzwilliams said of the debate. ''The thought of punching a road in there or taking a chain saw to it gets to people.''
 The wildness is still palpable in Ketchikan, which is shouldered onto a riverbank so close to cliffs that one lane of the main highway goes through the cliff itself. It is as common to see a bald eagle flying low above the streets here as it is to see a sea gull in Greenwich Village.
 The industry's growth here was a product of the national imperatives of the 1950's, said Stephen Haycox, a history professor at the University of Alaska. In cold war terms, Alaska was close to the enemy. It was considered strategically prudent to increase the population.
 But what were the new residents going to do? Well, there were a lot of trees. So Washington encouraged the start-up of three pulp mills by giving them 50-year contracts. By 1973, the Forest Service reported, timber harvests had increased ninefold, to an average of about 350 million board feet a year.
 Then the environmental movement focused on the Tongass. Legislation to extend the contracts for 15 years failed in Congress in the face of sharp opposition from environmental groups, and in 1993 and 1997, the last two pulp mills closed.
 Without the mills, profitable harvesting was difficult. The mills made pulp from hemlock trees, which are abundant in the Tongass but are smaller and less valuable than other species when sold as logs. With the closing of the mills and the rise of tree farming around the world, the old economics no longer worked.
 Not all environmentalists favor ending logging. Wayne Weihing, a former sawmill worker who is now an environmental advocate in Ketchikan, sees no problem with the current level of logging in the Tongass, which at 50 million board feet annually or less is barely enough to support one medium-size sawmill.
 ''We have to reinvent the industry,'' Mr. Weihing said. ''We're logging and building roads in places where we don't need it. These places are much more valuable as recreation areas.''
 In the mid-1990's, logging and wood products made up 12 percent of the employment base in Ketchikan, a 1999 study by the Alaska labor department found. The closing of the mills, with 500 jobs, cut that share in half. Cruise ships are now a core industry, and the city government is the largest employer.
 Three moderate-sized family-owned sawmills remain in the Tongass: Pacific Log and Lumber in Ketchikan, Silver Bay Logging in Wrangell and Viking Lumber in Craig. The Forest Service, besides giving them and their smaller competitors access to timber that had been off-limits, recently announced it would allow logging companies to cancel money-losing contracts for timber and would offer those rights at lower prices.
 Richard Buhler, president of Silver Bay, is taking up the Forest Service on its offer and turning back thousands of partly harvested acres, including the Upper Carroll area, on the mountainsides that rise from a glittering inlet east of Ketchikan. He has logged part of the tract but says he cannot cut the remaining trees profitably at the price he bid more than seven years ago.
 ''I believe that it's got a future,'' Mr. Buhler said of the Alaska timber industry. ''One of our big strong points is that the tree farms can't compete with the quality of our wood.''
 But Alaska is not alone in its economic doldrums. Along coastal British Columbia, timber sales have bumped generally downward for about 15 years. 
 Niche markets endure: Alaskan yellow cedar is still used for Japanese tatami rooms and Sitka spruce for sounding boards in high-end guitars.
 As Peter Butzelaar, a consultant with a Vancouver firm, R.E. Taylor & Associates, said: ''That resource does have market potential. The market does value Alaska's resource.
 ''But can it get to market competitively today?'' Mr. Butzelaar asked. ''Conditions say no.''

HEADLINE: G Is for Guzzler, T Is for Tax, O Is for Oops

BYLINE: By NORMAN MAYERSOHN

 BODY:
THE new Pontiac GTO has many claims to fame. It went from concept car to showroom model in only 18 months, demonstrating General Motors' new prowess in product development.
 It is fast, racing from a stop to 60 m.p.h. in just 5.3 seconds. It is nimble, taking curves at speeds that the original GTO of the 1960's couldn't have begun to handle. 
 And, surprisingly, it is a gas guzzler, the only mass-produced car with an American nameplate on the government's list. 
 To be sure, only GTO's with a four-speed automatic transmission are subject to the federal gas-guzzler tax. And with an economy rating of 16 miles per gallon in town and 21 on the highway, even that car does much better than many pickups and sport utility vehicles.
 But because the GTO is a passenger car, the rating is low enough to require buyers to pay a $1,000 guzzler tax. Trucks, including S.U.V.'s, are exempt.
 Still, the 350-horsepower GTO, which is built in Australia with the body of the Holden Monaro coupe and a Corvette engine (from Canada), contravenes a longtime General Motors policy of not selling gas guzzlers to the general public.
 G.M. could have avoided the penalty by selling GTO's only with a six-speed manual transmission; that version, with a mileage rating of 17/29 m.p.g., is not subject to the tax. Indeed, this is the approach the company took with another high-performance car, the new Cadillac CTS-V sedan, which comes only with a six-speed manual. Automatics generally get lower mileage than manuals.
 Enthusiasts may wonder why a Cadillac comes without an automatic while the GTO, from G.M.'s traditional performance division, has one as standard equipment. The GTO's manual is an option.
 The automatic GTO's guzzler status is not widely known, partly because G.M. did not disclose that information at the car's introduction to the press. Although the GTO has been on sale for two months, Pontiac's media Web site still said Friday that the car's mileage was ''to be determined.''
 At $33,000, the GTO is the lowest-priced 2004 model penalized for fuel consumption.
 Only a few Detroit names show up on the list. The Dodge Viper is one, but Chrysler sold only 2,103 Vipers in 2003; G.M. plans to import about 18,000 GTO's annually.
 Cadillac's special-purpose funeral coach and hearse also make the list, but they are not bought by the general population, and generally make only short trips to their occupants' final destinations. 
 G.M. has gone to considerable effort to avoid the guzzler stigma, developing technologies like variable displacement engines and a manual transmission that forced drivers of Corvettes, Camaros and Firebirds to skip gears in the interest of economy -- irritating many in the process. In its 2002 annual report, G.M. pointed to its investments in hydrogen fuel cells and went on to say, ''However, we're not putting off actions that we can take now to lower fuel consumption.''
 G.M., in fact, does make several large cars with mileage ratings that are among the best in their classes.
 G.M. officials, both in engineering and public relations, say the company had been operating under a clear directive, if not quite an iron-clad policy, to avoid making automobiles that would be subject to the guzzler tax. G.M. has not sold such a car since the low-production Cadillac Allante roadster of 1993.
 The results of this self-imposed policy are impressive: the Chevrolet Corvette, whose base engine is the same LS1 V-8 that is found under the GTO's hood (but a car that is 500 pounds lighter), returns 18/25 m.p.g. when equipped with an automatic. And like the GTO, the Corvette is no slouch in the performance department; its top speed is 176 m.p.h., Chevrolet says. No Corvette has ever been classified as a gas guzzler.
 Of course, the goal of good gas mileage is not entirely a matter of customer appeal or soothing the corporate conscience: the government can impose large fines if an automaker's corporate average fuel economy does not meet federal standards. 
 G.M. does not have to worry that the GTO is weighing down its average for domestic vehicles, since the Australian-built GTO is classified as an import. G.M.'s import average gets a lift from gas sippers like the Chevrolet Aveo, a Korean-built subcompact, and efficient four-cylinder Saabs.
 G.M. decided to make the GTO even if it was a guzzler because of what it saw as an urgent need to revive Pontiac's image. Thus, the car was not delayed while technology was developed that would have improved its mileage, like a more efficient six-speed automatic transmission. Pontiac also resisted makeshift solutions, like producing a front-drive GTO with a V-6 engine. 
 ''We weren't going to compromise,'' said Jim Hopson, a Pontiac spokesman. ''We wanted to put a car out there worthy of the name GTO.''
 Bringing the guzzler penalty to a lower price class may not stir protests. John DeCicco, a senior fellow at the Environmental Defense advocacy group, said: ''People are going to look at the window sticker and get annoyed, but not at Pontiac. They'll be mad at the federal government and its rules.'' 
 About half of GTO buyers have chosen the automatic transmission. Considering the poor mileage of so many trucks, the addition of 9,000 guzzlers to American roads will not have much effect on oil imports.

HEADLINE: Do Dividends Help? Look at Interest Rates, Not Tax Rates

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
THE tax cut on corporate dividends faces a new threat -- although a still-distant one. 
 The Democrats have found their voice in the presidential race. Both Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts and Senator John Edwards of North Carolina have pledged to repeal President Bush's tax cuts for people earning more than $200,000. For some investors, at least, that could mean a significant reduction of the dividend tax cut. 
 But in general, investors need not worry. The reduced tax rate on dividends, down to 15 percent from a high of 38.6 percent, has not played much of a role in stock performance.
 The dividend-paying stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index are expected to have outperformed the rest of the index in February. But it would be only the second month that they have done so since the big dividend tax cut was approved last May.
 Analysts say other factors, like the pace of economic growth and rising interest rates, are much more important drivers of stock performance. Some also argue that a threat to the dividend tax cut is not a reason to dump dividend-paying stocks. Investing on tax considerations alone, they say, is not a good idea in the long run. 
 Through Thursday, dividend-paying stocks, which make up 74 percent of the index, were up 2 percent, while the nonpayers, dominated by technology stocks, were down 0.1 percent, according to Howard Silverblatt, equity market analyst at S.&P. The only other month of outperformance was September, when payers fell 1.3 percent, compared with a decline of 2.8 percent for nonpayers. 
 In January, the nonpayers were up 5.7 percent while the payers rose 1.1 percent. For all of 2003, the nonpayers surged 61.7 percent while the payers rose 33.5 percent.
 In February, the dividend payers won in seven of the S.&P.'s 10 broad sectors. But in January, the nonpayers fared better in nine of them.
 On average, dividend payers won the February race in the consumer staples sector through Thursday. But that was because the stock of Winn-Dixie Stores, which became classified as a nonpayer by omitting its dividend, fell 5.5 percent. 
 In the energy sector, four of the nine top performers did not pay dividends. But the four -- Transocean, BJ Services, Nabors Industries and Noble -- were among the bottom 11 performers in this sector in 2003.
 Nonpayers were the better performers in health care this month but fared much worse in the industrial sector. In information technology, dividend payers fell 1.2 percent through Thursday, versus a decline of 2.4 percent for nonpayers. There are 23 companies in the sector that pay dividends, including Microsoft and Qualcomm, and 60 that don't. 
 James W. Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis, said that ''what is really going to drive stocks is whether they are economically sensitive or economically defensive.'' And whether an investor picks the economically sensitive sector or the economically defensive one depends on how soon he thinks the Federal Reserve will begin raising its short-term benchmark interest rate to slow growth and curb any jump in inflation.
 If the Fed waits until year-end or early 2005, economically sensitive stocks are likely to do well. These stocks, which include retail, media and appliance companies, tend to thrive when the economy is growing briskly. But a defensive position, including companies that supply energy and make household necessities like toothpaste, would be a better bet if an investor expected the Fed to move much sooner.
 BECAUSE it is not clear when the Fed will begin raising rates, both approaches did well in February. The consumer staples sector of the S.&P. 500, including dividend payers and nonpayers, fared best, up 5.7 percent through Friday, while energy, up 4 percent, was No. 3. These are defensive plays. The materials sector, in the economically sensitive category, was No. 2, up 4.9 percent.
 Mr. Paulsen still favors economically sensitive stocks but has begun to play a little defense, reducing holdings in consumer discretionary stocks and moving that money to consumer staples. ''We have started to step the other way but not very far,'' he said. ''By summer, we will have stepped farther.''

HEADLINE: Veterans of Past Murderous Campaigns Are Leading Haiti's New Rebellion

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER and LYDIA POLGREEN

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
The armed men trying to seize power in Haiti are led by death-squad veterans and convicted murderers, according to American officials and human rights groups.
 They are ''the new Haitian army,'' said one of their commanders, Remissainthe Ravix. They are also ''thugs,'' said Secretary of State Colin L. Powell.
 They are men like Louis-Jodel Chamblain and Jean-Pierre Baptiste -- two leaders of Fraph, the Haitian Front for Advancement and Progress. Fraph was an instrument of terror wielded by the military junta that overthrew Haiti's embattled president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide, in 1991. It killed thousands over the next three years. 
 Mr. Chamblain, a former Haitian Army officer, was sentenced in absentia to life in prison for the 1993 murder of Antoine Izmery, an important Aristide supporter. Before the trial, he fled to the neighboring Dominican Republic, returning to Haiti in recent months to seek power.
 Mr. Baptiste, also known as Jean Tatoune, was serving a life sentence for murder, in connection with a 1994 massacre of Aristide supporters, when he was freed in a jailbreak in August.
 ''Fraph is back,'' President Aristide said in an interview with The New York Times last week. The question now is whether these men will take power once again, and whether American military force, in the form of a naval deployment, may be necessary to stop them. Pentagon officials have said marines could be called upon to evacuate Americans and other foreigners and provide other assistance if the crisis worsened. 
 ''The Fraph and the Haitian Army are institutions with a long and very dark history,'' said James Dobbins, President Bill Clinton's special envoy to Haiti from 1994 to 1996.
 That past is entwined with American history. United States forces occupied Haiti from 1915 to 1934. They created the modern Haitian Army, dissolved Parliament and imposed martial law in those years. In the 1980's and early 1990's, the United States Central Intelligence Agency had important senior Haitian Army officers and Fraph members on its payroll, according to American officials.
 A decade ago, in 1994, the United States sent in 20,000 soldiers to reinstate Mr. Aristide after the Haitian Army overthrew him. Mr. Aristide disbanded the army upon his return to power. But he created nothing in its place beyond a small, American-trained national police force -- a force now filled with no-show officers, commanded by the president's cronies and corrupted by cocaine, according to a recent State Department report.
 Now Mr. Aristide has little with which to defend himself. His power base has crumbled, leaving only the dissolute national police and a rabble of street gangs. On Thursday, he was accused in an American courtroom by a convicted cocaine trafficker of taking drug payoffs.
 ''Aristide has been criticized, and with some justice, of allying himself with forces that may be criminal or corrupt,'' Mr. Dobbins said. ''But in a society which has no institutions, where all power derives from the use or the threat of force, it's impossible to govern without those alliances. It's the Haitian dilemma.''
 Broad-based alliances across Haitian society have lost faith in President Aristide. The political opposition includes victims of army power, like Evans Paul, a former mayor of Port-au-Prince, and once Mr. Aristide's campaign manager, who was arrested and tortured by Haitian military officers in 1989.
 Mr. Paul now says the president has two choices: to leave ''by the front door or the back door.''
 The political opposition in Haiti is united by its desire to depose Mr. Aristide, and the armed opposition by its hate for him.
 Veterans despise him because he dissolved the army. Street gangs detest him because they think he betrayed their leaders. Guy Philippe, a former police chief leading the rebels, says Mr. Aristide broke his promise to lift up the Haitian people.
 Mr. Aristide's supporters say the armed opposition seeks power for power's sake, to seize Haiti's ports and their cargoes of Colombian cocaine bound for the United States, and to pay back Mr. Aristide for disbanding the army.
 Mr. Philippe was trained by the United States military as an army officer in Ecuador, according to a report published Friday by Human Rights Watch, and earned a reputation as a brutal police chief on the north side of Port-au-Prince. In 2000, suspected of plotting a coup, he fled to the Dominican Republic.
 Mr. Aristide, who rose from slum priest to president preaching economic and spiritual deliverance, has made many such enemies. 
 ''When he was democratically elected in 1990 his support was overwhelming and from the heart,'' said James Morrell, director of the Haiti Democracy Project, who is among those onetime Aristide supporters now calling for his ouster. Mr. Aristide ''made a lot of mistakes, the biggest of which was that he demanded absolute power and absolute loyalty.''
 Timothy Carney, a former United States ambassador to Haiti, said Mr. Aristide spoke like a democrat but ''displayed the traditional predatory behavior of Haitian leaders, including the idea that he is the embodiment of the state.''
 The revolt sweeping Haiti began on Feb. 5 in Gonaives, the city where slaves who shook off Napoleon's rule declared this the first free black nation of the New World in January 1804, 200 years ago.
 A gang of embittered former Aristide supporters attacked a police station, overpowered the officers and took over the city. They believed that Mr. Aristide killed their leader, Amiot Metayer. Mr. Metayer was known as a charismatic, ruthless man. Butteur Metayer, Amiot's brother, said he had died because he knew about the Aristide government's drug ties.
 Butteur Metayer revived his brother's group and named it the Artibonite Resistance Front. Inspired by the front, others rose up, burning police stations, looting and plotting, setting off a chain reaction now reaching Port-au-Prince. 
 Early on Saturday, a relative calm returned to the city. Mr. Aristide spoke by telephone late on Friday on national television, urging militants to stop the violence and looting that has convulsed the capital. 
 ''We should prevent ill-intentioned people from infiltrating our movement and polluting it,'' Mr. Aristide said. His remarks seemed to be a response to a statement by the American Embassy here blaming the president for the violence and demanding that he put a stop to it. 
 The public face of the rebel army is the smile of Mr. Philippe, the former police chief. He is suspected by both Haitian and United States officials of cocaine trafficking.
 In an interview last week at a seaside hotel that his troops are using as their base in Cap Haitien, Haiti's second largest city, Mr. Philippe said he had no lust for power.
 ''I am not ambitious,'' Mr. Philippe said, swigging a beer as his men lounged by a swimming pool, machine guns cradled in their laps. ''What I want is a better life for the Haitian people. What I want is democracy.''
 Mr. Philippe has few democratic credentials. In 2001, while he stood accused of planning a coup, the government said he masterminded a raid on the presidential palace that left seven dead. 
 He is joined in this rebellion by Mr. Chamblain, the convicted assassin from Fraph. (The acronym Fraph is a play on the French word frapper, to hit.) Mr. Chamblain denied in an interview that he or his group ever killed anyone, a contention belied by overwhelming evidence.
 ''I was never paramilitary chief,'' Mr. Chamblain said. ''I was the leader of a political organization. Fraph helped people and brought the Haitian people together.''
 He said he joined the revolt against Mr. Aristide because the president had betrayed the principles of the men who freed Haiti from France two centuries ago. ''This fight is to liberate the Haitian people under the regime of Jean-Bertrand Aristide,'' Mr. Chamblain said.
 Also along for the ride are former army officers like Mr. Ravix, a 38-year-old former corporal.
 ''There is no such thing as the former Haitian Army,'' said Mr. Ravix, a bull-necked, barrel-chested man, still bitter about the army's dissolution. ''Aristide made a big mistake sending us home with our guns.''
 If this is indeed ''the new Haitian army,'' as Mr. Ravix says, it represents the revival of a force that has always served Haiti's tiny elite, less than two percent of the people holding at least half the nation's wealth.
 The armed rebels are not a large force. They may number as few as 500 trained fighters, American officials believe. It is an open question whether a force that size could seize this sprawling capital. But it has proved capable of creating fear and havoc. 
 Their assault weapons and crisp camouflage uniforms suggest the rebels have outside support. Mr. Philippe said his force was receiving donations from Haitian exiles in the United States and Canada. In a country where drug money flows freely, government officials have accused the rebels of financing their assault with money from Colombian cocaine cartels.
 From the 1980's into the early 1990's, the Haitian Army and its National Intelligence Service -- an agency created and financed by the C.I.A. -- committed acts of terror and trafficked in cocaine, according to American officials.
 There is no known evidence that the United States has supported the armed uprising against Mr. Aristide, although the White House is strongly suggesting that he should step down. 
 ''We cannot allow these thugs to come out of the hills, or even an opposition to simply rise up and say 'we want you to leave' in an undemocratic, nonconstitutional manner,'' Secretary Powell said on Feb. 19.
 A senior administration official said Saturday, ''We cannot be in the position of going in to oust an elected leader.''
 But, by law or by force, the end may be near for Mr. Aristide, the priest who came to power preaching democracy in Haiti but delivered only its stillbirth.
 ''I think this is the end game for Aristide,'' said Mr. Carney, the former American ambassador. ''I think things will move very fast. He will go. If he is so foolish as to think he could stay, it will be feet first.''

LENGTH: 694 words

HEADLINE: Bush Allies Don't Expect To Overtake Kerry Soon

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Feb. 28 

 BODY:
President Bush's campaign strategists say they now expect to trail or do no better than run even with Senator John Kerry through the summer, despite their aggressive new effort to counter months of Democratic attacks.
 Some Republicans said the campaign's assessment was intended in part to lower expectations and convince jittery supporters that the election was unfolding just as the White House had anticipated. But they said it also reflected a belief that the president had his work cut out for him in getting back on the offensive after a period in which events outside Mr. Bush's control and concerted Democratic criticism had undermined his political strength. 
 After Tuesday's primaries in 10 states, the White House plans to step up a counterassault that began last Monday when Mr. Bush delivered his first speech of the general election campaign, officials said.
 Mr. Bush will make a foray into the heart of the Democratic base, visiting California on Wednesday and Thursday to collect more money toward his goal of raising $175 million or more to last him through the summer. He will start putting his war chest to work in earnest on Thursday when he begins running television advertising.
 Strategists with ties to the Bush campaign said the White House was working with the Republican leadership in Congress to draw sharp distinctions between the parties through votes and debates on various issues. The campaign is increasingly deploying surrogates, from senators to county chairmen, to make its case.
 ''As this becomes a two-man race, we need to define the stakes,'' said Terry Holt, the Bush campaign's spokesman.
 Mr. Bush himself, the strategists said, will refine his stump speech so that it is less about his accomplishments so far than about the opportunities he has created for the future, and the stark choices facing the voters in November. Chief among them, Republicans said, would be whether the country wants to entrust its security to a Democratic challenger that the White House is busily portraying as too liberal and lacking in principle.
 ''The real challenge, and the concern -- not worry -- is that they need to be able to implement a strategy, a series of tactics, that will enable the president to define the election on terms favorable to him,'' said one Republican who works closely with the White House.
 ''Uniquely for a successful incumbent, he has not been able to do that so far,'' said the Republican, who demanded anonymity in part because the White House discourages its allies from speaking openly to reporters but also because he said he wants to remain behind the scenes.
 ''The next phase of the campaign, from early March to mid- or late April, is about whether the election is going to be fought on safety, security, America's place in the world and keeping the economy growing -- the issues that are good for the president,'' the Republican said. ''If it's about credibility, weapons of mass destruction, intelligence failures and job creation, Bush will lose.''
 Matthew Dowd, the Bush campaign's chief strategist, predicted in a widely circulated memorandum late last year that the race would be neck-and-neck by spring, when the Democrats settled on their nominee. With that prediction having come true and then some, Mr. Dowd said in an interview that the Bush campaign now had to begin a methodical task of changing many of the perceptions created among voters by the intense focus given to the Democrats.
 At the same time, Mr. Bush remains in a fundamentally strong position, Mr. Dowd said. His approval rating is around 50 percent in the polls, Mr. Dowd said, just slightly below where Bill Clinton was at this point in the 1996 race, which he went on to win easily over Bob Dole.
 The confident face put on by the Bush campaign belies some anxiety in the Republican ranks. Most national polls for the last several weeks have shown Mr. Kerry leading Mr. Bush in a head-to-head matchup. At this point in his 1996 re-election race, Mr. Clinton was well ahead of Mr. Dole, and he never gave up the lead. President Ronald Reagan had established a double-digit lead over Walter Mondale by this point in 1984.

SECTION: Section 11; Column 2; Real Estate Desk; Pg. 7; If You're Thinking of Living In/Mariner's Harbor, Staten Island

LENGTH: 1685 words

HEADLINE: Signs of Revival in a Waterfront Area

BYLINE: By JANICE FIORAVANTE

 BODY:
MARINER'S HARBOR has a prime waterfront location along Arthur Kill and Kill Van Kull at the northwest corner of Staten Island, and its fortunes have risen or fallen with a tide of maritime activities.
 Sea captains built stately shoreside homes in the area in early 19th century. Later, shipbuilding was an important industry from the days of wooden ships through the construction of destroyers for World War II. ''A couple thousand people worked at the Bethlehem Steel Shipyards during the war,'' said Vincent Pompa, a past president of the Mariner's Harbor Civic Association.
 But the area faltered badly in the second half of the 20th century, and some homes fell into disrepair. Lately, however, there have been promising signs of a revival in the neighborhood, whose borders ashore are Morningstar Road on the east and the Staten Island Expressway, Forest Avenue and Wilcox Street on the south. 
 City Councilman Michael E. McMahon, a Democrat who represents Mariner's Harbor, said the area is experiencing ''a serious economic boom.'' This is reflected in part by an influx of retailers. Wal-Mart is negotiating for a 28-acre site at Forest Avenue and South Avenue, he said. A Lowe's home improvement store opened in December, an 16-screen multiplex opened two years ago and a Home Depot appeared about five years ago. A Charlie Brown's steakhouse is also being constructed.
 There has been a similar flurry of activity in the housing market, where there are two distinct sectors. A few old sea captain's houses with widow's walks remain, and a large number of homes date back to the first three decades of the 20th century. Many others have been built within the last 10 years.
 MARINER'S HARBOR did not go through the development boom that most of the rest of Staten Island experienced after the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge opened in 1964, in part because there were bigger tracts of undeveloped land elsewhere, explained Robert Kelly, owner of ERA Master Realty. It has only been in recent years that developers turned to the area. 
 ''As land has become scarcer on the Island, developers have been looking for other communities where they can build affordable houses, and Mariner's Harbor fit the bill,'' said Joseph Carroll, district manager of Community Board 1. Even here prices are rising steadily, he added. A starter house in a town house development cost $100,000 as little as three or four ago. ''Today, that house starts at over $200,000, and some are even as high as $300,000 and over,'' he said. 
 ''As you tour the community, you'll see such a dichotomy on each block,'' Mr. Kelly continued. ''You'll see large homes on double and triple lots, and right next to them you'll see multiple houses, brand new or less than 10 years old.'' In some cases older homes are being torn down and replaced by new homes.
 Off Harbor Road, for example, Jerry Bivona, president of the Glendale Corporation, a development company, is nearing completion of a court of eight two-family detached homes, which are selling for $379,900.
 In general, homes that are three years old or younger are detached one- or two-family homes. Houses built more than three years ago tend to be multiple houses, either town houses or semidetached. Mr. Kelly credited the Civic Association with leading a campaign that resulted in a rezoning to allow only detached homes to be built.
 Along Richmond Terrace, welding supply shops, junkyards and iron works dominate because this part of the community is zoned for industrial activities. Forest Avenue is the shopping corridor, with bagel shops and McDonald's and restaurants like Real Madrid and La Riviera.
 ''It's good to see business thriving,'' said Linda Baran, interim president of the Staten Island Chamber of Commerce. ''The community had taken a huge slide. Properties like a former Major's department store and a former welfare hotel have been sitting empty and deteriorating for years.''
 While new development has fostered a community revival, services are not keeping up with growth, residents say. They cite increasing traffic, a shortage of parking and overcrowded schools. ''The area needs more schools,'' Mr. Carroll said. 
 Edwin Markham Intermediate School 51 at 20 Houston Street will be the recipient in the fall of the prefabricated annex that is currently serving Public School 44, where it is used for fourth and fifth grade classes. ''We're slated for eight new classrooms for our main building to begin construction in spring'' and be finished by the end of the summer, said the principal of P.S. 44, Rhonda Wittfield.
 I.S. 51 is expecting the annex in August. The school, with about 1,500 students in Grades 6, 7 and 8, ''was built for 1,100 -- that's the problem,'' said the principal, Emma Della Rocca. Next year the school will be splitting into three academies: for health and sciences, math and engineering, and humanities. ''All students will have an opportunity by the end of the school year to choose which academy they want to attend,'' Mrs. Della Rocca said. ''We believe this will foster community among students throughout all three grades.'' 
 The school has a jazz band, a dance band and a drama club, which is preparing ''The Wiz'' for performance in March. After-school programs that run from 2 to 5 p.m. include basketball, digital photography and help with homework. 
 P.S. 44 at 80 Maple Parkway, with 915 students, offers prekindergarten through Grade 5. After-school activities include painting and other arts and crafts, working with computers and sports. The chorus, made up of students from Grades 4 and 5, performed earlier this month at St. John's University. At the school, 44 percent of students in Grades 3 and 4 read at or above grade levels, while 74 percent are at or exceed standards for math.
 MOST high school students in the neighborhood go to Port Richmond High School. Of the 460 graduates last June, 67 percent headed to four-year colleges, while 28 percent went to two-year schools. For the past six to eight years, Port Richmond has been chosen as a Top 500 school by Newsweek magazine, based on the number of seniors taking Advanced Placement courses, said Robert Graham, the principal.
 The high school marching band performed at last year's St. Patrick's Day parade in Manhattan and will do so again this year. ''We have five different bands, including advanced and intermediate concert bands, a jazz ensemble and a guitar ensemble,'' Mr. Graham said. ''We have over 200 students in our music program.'' 
 The school also has 32 different athletic teams. One of its distinctive events is a ''student of the month'' breakfast. ''We host about a dozen students, one from every subject area, and their families in our library at 7 o'clock in the morning,'' said Mr. Graham. ''Our culinary arts students cook and serve.''
 A plan for a Mariner's Harbor branch of the New York Public Library was announced last month. R. Randy Lee, a lawyer and developer, said he would donate land he owns at 206 South Avenue for the 11,000-square-feet facility, which is expected to open its doors in 2007. Mariner's Harbor residents have been requesting a library since at least 1938, according to Norman Holman of the New York Public Library.
 In fact, it was ''1937,'' corrected Mr. Pompa, 76, the former president of the Civic Association and a retired chemist who teaches science at Port Richmond High as a substitute. ''I wish the site chosen would be closer to the schools.'' 
 In the northwest corner of Mariner's Harbor is Arlington, which has one of the first trailer parks in New York City, Mr. Pompa said. Called Goethals, ''a Garden Homes community,'' it has rows and rows of permanent mobile homes within shouting distance of the Goethals Bridge.
 The Mariner's Harbor neighborhood is also home to the Mariner's Harbor Houses, a New York Public Housing complex with 22 buildings, three and six stories high, with 605 apartments housing 1,728 residents. Completed in 1954, the houses sit on a 22-acre site bounded by Brabant Street, Roxbury Street, Continental Place and Grandview Avenue.
 The housing stock also includes modest one-family homes that were built to house workers from the shipbuilding times as well as workers from Procter & Gamble's Port Ivory facility, which today is Howland Hook Marine Terminal, home of a container port. ''What they used to make here was Duncan Hines cake mixes, Crisco and soap,'' Mr. Pompa said. ''The whole complex was sold to the Port Authority.''
 The P.& G. jobs had an important place in the community. ''Grandfathers, sons and sons' sons worked for the plants,'' he added. ''It was a very family operation.''
 THE continuity of the community was also mentioned by Jane Norberg, the current Civic Association president. ''When I first moved here 30 years ago,'' she said, ''married siblings would live on the same block as their parents. Today, the area is still family-oriented, but not as inbred as then.''
 Italians and Poles predominated in the past -- ''the Polish butchers and St. Adalbert's Church still serve to remind residents of that history,'' she said. ''Today, we're quite diversified ethnically.'' At P.S. 44, for instance, about 40 percent of the students have Hispanic or Filipino backgrounds.
 The neighborhood seems to be attracting a number of immigrants. ''The new construction is some of the most affordable houses on Staten Island,'' said Mr. Kelly of ERA Master Builders. ''What is needed, desperately in my opinion, is for the dormant shipyards and other manufacturing areas along the Terrace, to be rezoned for residential and commercial applications. There's been no shipbuilding industry here for some time, and it's not coming back.''
 Still, much is already happening in Mariner's Harbor. Even a new park is planned; it is along Forest Avenue near Simonson Avenue at the Graniteville quarry. ''It's an unusual bit of land because it's a rock quarry, which the state has purchased with the intention of making it a three-and-a-half acre park,'' Mr. McMahon said. The site contains a rare rock formation that is distinctive because of ledges of granite at various levels.

 ZIP, 10303.FROM SOAP BARS TO SHIPPING: In October 1907, Procter & Gamble opened a factory in Mariner's Harbor. The surrounding area came to be called Port Ivory for the factory, which produced one million cases of Ivory and other bar soaps a year as well as other household products, including cake mixes and shortening. In November 1991, the company closed its facility after 84 years of operation. The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey purchased the site, and it is now part of the Howland Hook Marine Terminal, which houses a container port. The Port Authority has invested more than $59 million in the facility, which has enough berths to handle three vessels simultaneously as well as 147 acres of open area for container storage. The terminal moves about 425,000 containers annually, and about 3,000 people work there.Map of Staten Island highlighting Mariner's Harbor and surrounding areas.
