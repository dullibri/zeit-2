HEADLINE: Medicine Promotes Itself, With Professional Help

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
"WE'RE on the phone 40 hours a week for him; we mail out videos, press kits, action photos; we give him an angle, a special hook," exults Lilly Lipton, a public relations consultant in Studio City, Calif. "He is a celebrity. He is!"
Is her client an actor? A rock star? Maybe a rising politician? No. He is Dr. Ian R. Brown, a surgeon. Thanks to Ms. Lipton's aggressive promotion, Dr. Brown says, he has appeared on dozens of television programs from the news to "Entertainment Tonight" to "Geraldo." As a result, his cosmetic surgery practice is thriving. 
 "They tell me there's a recession now, but I'm not feeling it," he said. "Because of public relations I've gotten a lot of new patients, and also some hostility from other doctors."
Once shunned by doctors as crass and unprofessional, marketing and public relations have now been increasingly accepted as a cornerstone of a successful practice. In an era of economic hard times, as hospitals and doctors compete for paying patients, more and more are promoting themselves to prospective customers.
Critics worry that it encourages unnecessary procedures, driving up the nation's health costs and may sometimes be dangerous when it leads patients to doctors whose marketing budgets outweigh their professional skills.
While few doctors and hospitals rely on outright advertising, many embrace public relations. The P.R. trend is most pronounced in the West, South and Southwest but is noticeable around the country.
Ms. Lipton estimates that 60 percent of doctors in the Los Angeles area do P.R. In New York, "virtually 100 percent" of hospitals have taken on full-time public relations staff members, including the most staid ivory tower institutions, said Howard J. Rubenstein, president of the huge public relations firm that bears his name.
Rubenstein Associates, known for representing celebrities like Donald Trump, now writes news releases and handles news media coverage for about 20 hospitals in the New York area, including New York University Medical Center and the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center. While Mr. Rubenstein said he had represented hospitals from time to time in the last two decades, the volume has sharply increased in the last three to five years.
"It used to be just plastic surgeons and dermatologists, but now all sorts of specialists and every little community hospital is jumping in," said Dr. Arnold J. Relman, editor emeritus of The New England Journal of Medicine. "I think it's unfortunate, but medicine has come to be regarded as a business where the name of the game is to sell."
Health-care experts say that promoting medical services in the same spirit as promoting running shoes or laundry detergent poses hazards for patients. The glossy brochures and hard-sell phone calls can become the basis of magazine articles or news segments that seem objective but contain subtle biases. When a public relations agency surveyed 2,500 editors and reporters around the country, it found that 90 percent of ideas for health articles had originated with a public relations person, far higher than the 75 percent of entertainment articles and programs that the survey said were suggested by public relations firms.
While a public relations agency obviously has a vested interest in showing the effectiveness of P.R., experts say the trend is real and troublesome.
"The public should know that most of what they see on the evening news is there because a publicist has pushed it, not necessarily because it is the best treatment," said Dr. Harold Ravins, a Los Angeles dentist who is one of Ms. Lipton's clients. "Marketing is about money, and some treatments that should be promoted in terms of health are not."
Worse still, experts say, materials released by public relations agents often promote marginal or unnecessary care and may be misleading.
For example, when a community hospital publicizes its new mammography equipment, it "suggests that the facility is offering something special or of higher quality, which it isn't," Dr. Relman said. "And promotion often plays on the fears of patients: 'How do you know you don't have prostate cancer? Come to our clinic and be checked out.' "
 
Ethics of Marketing
 Many doctors insist that marketing medicine can be done ethically. Dr. Neil Baum, a New Orleans urologist, quietly began promoting his fledgling practice in the mid-1980's and says he reluctantly went public in 1988, when the American Medical Association newspaper asked him to write a monthly marketing column.
"Not long ago you would get kicked out of the medical societies for doing this and I was worried about losing the respect of my colleagues," Dr. Baum said. He has since become something of a marketing guru and is now booked to speak at medical meetings seven months in advance.
Trying to carve out a niche at a hospital with 13 other urologists, Dr. Baum found business inspiration in H. Ross Perot's formula for success: find unmet needs in the market; learn the industry cold; fill those needs.
Realizing that 5 million American men suffer from impotence that could be treated with surgery and knowing that only about 50,000 had been operated on, Dr. Baum began promoting his expertise in this field. He took on another taboo medical problem, incontinence, as well. He spoke before Rotary clubs, called local television stations and wrote articles for magazines and bulletins for the elderly. One such article generated 50 referrals and 5 operations, for an immediate added income of more than $10,000.
"I see my practice as a shopping cart," Dr. Baum said. "The patients in the practice area are like items in the cart. The goal of marketing is to let those outside know what you do and how to get to you, and I think that can be done ethically."
 
A Once-Unthinkable Idea
 Twenty years ago, a debate about medical marketing would have been unthinkable; both the American Medical Association and the American Dental Association strictly forbade advertising and promotional activities.
But in 1975, the Supreme Court ruled that antitrust law prohibited the American Bar Association from regulating the business practices of lawyers. Fearing lawsuits from entrepreneurial doctors and dentists, the medical societies dropped their stand.
"I'm sure the major medical organization are very unhappy with the trend, but they are too timid to do anything," Dr. Relman said.
In fact, attitudes as well as laws have changed.
"When I used to tell doctors that I could get them in tabloids, they'd say 'Oh no,' " said Ms. Lipton, who is the director of a company called the Public Information Network. "Now they're thrilled."
Dr. Robert Kotler, a Los Angeles plastic surgeon, has used four or five different public relations agencies to promote various parts of his practice. "Sure there can be too much hype," he said, "but people have to have a little bit of reserve about what they're going to obtain, whether in dishwashers or in health care."
For many doctors, particularly in places with a surplus of doctors in a given specialty, the impetus is primarily financial.
As a result, the recession has been a boon for medical public relations. "As doctors and institutions are squeezed economically, they find that P.R. is more and more important," Mr. Rubenstein said. "They have to be more creative in telling their story."
But if money is the motive for some doctors, others who market their practices describe themselves as educators who use public relations to inform patients about new techniques.
Still others clearly enjoy the spotlight. "In the long run I hope it will have an impact on my practice, and I would like more name recognition with the general public," said Dr. Marvin Karp, who specializes in musculoskeletal injuries in Los Angeles. "But also I though it would be fun to dabble in the media, maybe even have my own talk show someday."
The procedures and tests most heavily promoted are elective. Also, experts say that doctors who invest heavily in promotion are more likely to have unusual practices or training, so that they fall outside of traditional referral patterns.
For example, both Dr. Kotler and Dr. Brown are head and neck surgeons who subsequently specialized in facial cosmetic surgery and now limit their practices to this field; they are not plastic surgeons. Although they can legitimately perform a wide variety of cosmetic operations from nose jobs to face lifts, they would not be recommended by groups like the American Society for Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons.
"The societies are so cliquish," Ms. Lipton said.
But today, even the most established, mainstream medical institutions frequently hire layer upon layer of public relations help, with hospitals represented by one firm and departments or individual doctors by another.
For such institutions, the goal is often to attract insured customers to prestigious practices and hospitals that are nonetheless in financial distress because of a heavy load of Medicaid and nonpaying patients. Also, academic medical centers are increasingly dependent on donations, which in a tight economy are felt to be closely tied to a strong public image.
Public relations consultants offer their clients a wide variety of services, for fees ranging from $1,500 to $5,000 a month. Mr. Rubenstein said his firm had been asked at various times to promote a new wing, to advise on a fund raiser, to write employee manuals or to prepare releases to news organizations. Such releases often appear on the hospital's own stationery, to disguise the involvement of a paid public relations firm.
"P.R. was such anathema in the medical world for so many years that a lot is still done very quietly," said Anthony Mora, who heads Anthony Mora Associates, a medical public relations firm in Los Angeles.
For individual doctors, public relations agents will often arrange for television or radio appearances and provide training to make sure they are up to the task. Ms. Lipton said she frequently started her clients on local radio talk shows or a cable show she produces to help them gain confidence.
In contrast, Dr. Baum advises a do-it-yourself strategy. "I don't want anyone going out saying I am the best urologist or making unrealistic promises," he says. "After all, you are not marketing Donald Trump. This is much more delicate."
His office has adopted what he calls "the Disney approach." He puts out a newsletter, receptionists use prospective patients' names twice during phone calls and banners carrying motivational statements have supplanted medical degrees on the walls.
When Time magazine described a new screening test for prostate cancer last spring, Dr. Baum photocopied the article and sent it out to his patients with the next billing cycle, with a note saying, "We offer this!" Dr. Baum acknowledges that urologists are divided about the utility of the test for general screening, but he believes that every man over 50 should have it.
"There isn't a doctor in America who can't market himself if he uses a little common sense and makes some observations from industry," Dr. Baum said. And displaying promotional flair, he added that his new book, "Marketing Your Clinical Practice" (Aspen Publishers, 1991), could show them how.

HEADLINE: The Recession, as Seen From 1993

 BODY:
Excerpts from news conference in June 1993 with Thomas Foley, Democrat and Speaker of the House, and Newt Gingrich, House Republican whip.
Reporter: Back in December 1991 the economy was sagging and threatening to get much worse. The number of people working fell an astonishing 250,000 in one month. Now, 18 months later, the economy's still stagnating. Looking back, Mr. Gingrich, why did you propose tax subsidies on retirement savings of the rich? 
 Gingrich: Because saving spurs growth.
Reporter: But wouldn't your plan have lowered consumer spending, meaning lower sales and more layoffs during the recession?
Gingrich: Well, Republicans believe tax cuts stimulate growth.
Reporter: But could a tax cut like that stimulate growth anywhere near fast enough to fight recession?
Gingrich: Oh, I'm sure there must be some economist who thinks it could have done so.
Reporter: Well, you also proposed a cut in the tax rate on capital gains. I can understand the benefit of making new investment more profitable. But you also would have cut taxes on sales of everything old. Instead of lining rich people's pockets, why didn't you limit the cut to future investment?
Gingrich: Well, you have a point, but even so, the tax code is unfair to investors.
Reporter: Is that why many of your Republican colleagues favored indexing capital gains -- so that only price increases above inflation would be taxed?
Gingrich: Of course, That's only fair.
Reporter: But it sounds as though that would distort investment. Unless you also indexed interest payments and depreciation allowances, people would be driven to invest where taxes are low, not where productivity is high.
Gingrich: Let me get back to you about that.
Reporter: Mr. Foley, Looking back again to December 1991, weren't Democrats embarrassed by pushing so hard for permanent tax cuts for middle-class families?
Foley: No. They pushed hard because they wanted to fight the recession.
Reporter: But why raise the long-term deficit by fighting a temporary recession with permanent tax cuts?
Foley: Maybe that's not such a hot idea. But some Democrats proposed offsetting middle-class tax cuts by raising taxes on the rich.
Reporter: But those proposed tax cuts were tiny, and had to be. There aren't enough rich people.
Foley: Yes, but there were also proposals to offset the tax cuts with delayed cuts in defense. That would have meant instant tax relief and no long-term rise in the deficit. Nifty, no?
Reporter: I don't follow you. Congress is already required to make huge spending cuts under the budget law. If next year's defense cuts had been pledged to pay for previous middle-class tax cuts, wouldn't Congress have to make massive cuts in education, research and every other public investment?
Foley and Gingrich: You forget that the middle class had suffered stagnant incomes for more than a decade and deserved a break.
Reporter: But that wasn't because of taxes. It was because of low productivity growth, no? In the end, did Congress do anything to solve either need, to fight the recession or spur long-run investment and growth?
Foley and Gingrich: Well, no, not really.
Reporter: Can either of you guess why the economy is stagnant 18 months later?

HEADLINE: Russian Farms Need More Than Privatization;
Women Keep It Going

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"No Matryoshkas Need Apply" by Yelena Khanga (Op-Ed, Nov. 25) presents Soviet women as either pretty, young and dreaming of becoming "high-class call girls" or ugly, old and doomed to do boring, dirty jobs. 
 There are a lot of women in between. It is thanks to Soviet women that what used to be the Soviet Union is still functioning -- despite a 1,000 percent annual inflation and empty store shelves. It is women who stand for hours in lines, keep their houses tidy, their children healthy and the families surviving. Men have given up. All they can do with the country in tailspin is watch political debates on television and contemplate the fate of Mother Russia. About the only lines men stand in are lines for vodka. Their response to the everyday struggle for survival is swearing and retreat to the nearest couch.
It is true that Soviet society is very sexist, has no feminist movement, its "social behavior is 100 years behind" American behavior, and the majority of Soviet leaders and politicians you see on television are men. But television and some opinion polls of teen-agers do not represent the society.
Women and men in my country are both in dire straits -- but under the surface it is women who make the survival of the society possible, though they might talk about it less than men do.

HEADLINE: If They Remember How to Be Democrats

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Tom Wicker's right-to-the-point Dec. 1 column, "Where the Ducks Are" -- a reference to the need for the Democrats in 1992 to seek votes in states like California, Michigan and Illinois, rather than the South, to "go hunting where the ducks are" -- gives a sound analysis of what the results might have been if the Democrats had adopted a different number strategy in the 1988 election. Surprisingly, however, Mr. Wicker omits any mention of another vital element in the Presidential election fortunes of the Democrats. 
 The failure of the Democratic Party to win back the Presidency lies both in the mistaken numbers approach, the Southern strategy, and in the message adopted by recent candidates. Democrats will not reoccupy the White House until they begin to talk and act like Democrats instead of warmed-over Republicans.
That message should now be abundantly clear from the results of the special Senate election in Pennsylvania. Harris Wofford's campaign message was a clarion call to do something about the condition of society. In that electoral case, the emphasis was on the dismal state of the nation's health care.
The other issues that concern Americans can convey electoral messages just as potent if delivered ringingly and without equivocation:
Too many Americans are functionally illiterate. The condition of our schools and the ability of teachers to teach has declined to dangerous levels, while Washington talks about the schools but withdraws financial support for them.
Too many Americans are unemployed and dependent for bare survival on unemployment insurance (and that will run out, even as extended, if the recession continues much longer) and welfare. Too many Americans are homeless, a condition that has worsened as the Federal Government has withdrawn from the housing business.
Too many Americans are breathing tainted air, drinking chancy water and eating food that was grown on questionable soil. Too many Americans live in cities that struggle to survive as the Federal Government has turned away from urban blight.
Too many Americans are disheartened and look for racial, ethnic, gender or other scapegoats because no one has addressed, and given hope for solving, the real problems that are facing the nation.
The Democrats can win if they know where the ducks are -- and if they begin to talk and lead like Democrats.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Prices Mostly Unchanged

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities moved erratically but ended mostly unchanged yesterday, as credit market participants struggled to sort out remarks made in Washington by David Mullins, vice chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.
In a speech delivered at the National Economists Club, Mr. Mullins gave an essentially upbeat economics assessment, saying that the Fed's persistent reductions in short-term interest rates since mid-1990 should produce a pickup in economic activity by the middle of next year. 
 Echoing a theme that was embraced last week by the Treasury, Secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, Mr. Mullins said the idea of shifting Treasury borrowings toward shorter maturities and away from long-term bonds was worth further study.
Discussion about that subject has circulated through the market for the last six weeks or more. With the spread, or difference, between long-term bond yields and rates on short-term bills and notes at record levels, some economists have suggested that the Treasury cut its issuance of 30-year bonds as a way to lower long-term interest rates and stimulate the economy.
 
An Upset to Traders
 The possibility that Washington might tinker with the way it borrows money upset traders of short-term bills and notes. So, too, did Mr. Mullins's comments about an improving economy, which some market participants took to mean that the Fed had finished its easing policy.
Short-term rates, which had been moving lower during the morning, went back up after Mr. Mullins's comments moved across trading screens.
"Mr. Mullins said all the right things to get people nervous," one Treasury-bill trader said. "For today at least, he broke the back of the rally" in short-term rates.
But some analysts said too much was made of what the Fed official said.
"He implied that easing is over for this cycle, but I don't think that is the case," said James Fralick, a principal and senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. "To say Fed easing is over is not consistent with the kind of economic data we have been seeing."
 
Disproven Optimism
 Mr. Fralick and others recalled that over the last year, various Fed officials had provided optimistic assessments about the economy's prospects, forecasts that have subsequently proved wrong.
"We have been told by people at the Fed that recovery was coming in the spring of 1991," said Raymond W. Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J., research firm. "Then it was supposed to happen during the summer, then in the fall. I tend to think the Fed will react to the data as it comes in. And despite what Mr. Mullins said, I would not rule out a cut in the discount rate."
Mr. Mullins's speech attracted so much attention because there was little else to focus on yesterday, traders said. Despite some movement during the day, prices of most issues were little changed.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 102 1/2 late yesterday, to yield 7.78 percent, unchanged from late Monday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered at 102 2/32, up 2/32, to yield 7.20 percent. And the 5.50 percent two-year notes were also unchanged, at an offered price of 100 27/32, to yield 5.04 percent.
Early in the session, the two-year notes traded at a price to yield 4.99 percent, a low level many traders said they had never seen.
Short-term Treasury bill rates were narrowly mixed. Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 4.16 percent late yesterday, down three basis points, or three one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates fell by one basis point, to a late offered rate of 4.17 percent. But one-year bill rates rose by three basis points, to a late offered rate of 4.22 percent.
Low interest rates and the approach of the year's end prompted a flood of new investment-grade corporate bonds to be priced yesterday, as eight companies offered some $1.8 billion worth of new securities.
Among the issuers was GPA Delaware, a subsidiary of GPA Group P.L.C., the big British conglomerate. The unit sold $500 million worth of seven-year notes guaranteed by its parent through an underwriting group led by Merrill Lynch & Company.
The 8 3/8 percent securities, which mature on Dec. 15, 1998, were priced at $99.635 to yield 8.821 percent, 2.125 percentage points more than the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 1/8 percent seven-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities, which are noncallable for life, are rated Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service and A- by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the tax-exempt bond market, the State of New Jersey sold a total of $451 million in bonds at competitive bid. A group led by Lehman Brothers won the $425.89 million worth of tax-exempt securities.
The bonds were reoffered to investors at yields ranging from 4.20 percent on securities maturing in 1993, to 6.45 percent on bonds that mature in 2012.

HEADLINE: Friars Who Tend the Forgotten, Helped by the Neediest Cases Fund

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
A tall, bearded man wearing a monk's coarse black robe and sandals strode along the streets of the South Bronx -- past the rubble lots, the garbage, the gutted cars, the buildings burned down or bricked up.
A group of homeless men around a bench sized him up him warily. The eyes of four teen-age boys followed him down the sidewalk. The night before, he recalled, a woman cackled hysterically as he walked by. 
 "They're still startled to see us," he said, turning to climb an apartment building's worn steps. "To them we look like something out of the Middle Ages. I've been called Ninja, Buddhist. One woman asked me if I was Ku Klux Klan."
At the top of the stairs, though, he was no stranger. "Brother John! Brother John!" a boy squealed as the monk entered a fourth-floor apartment carrying a bag of rolls and oranges. The boy, Jeremy, ran at a full waddle down the long hallway and up and into his arms.
 
Helping Young and Old
 For 15 years, the San Damiano friars have lived according to their vows of poverty in Morrisania, one of New York City's poorest neighborhoods. The five Franciscan brothers in the boxy, red-brick friary distribute clothing and food, including vegetables they grow in plots around the friary. They operate a senior center on Wednesdays and a youth center on Saturdays. They visit addicts in Bronx-Lebanon Hospital and the homes of elderly people who, because of age or illness, are shut in. In a fearful area of dreadful needs, they offer what help they can.
Each brother lives in a small room that is bare except for a mattress and table. The principal decoration is replicas of the San Damiano crucifix that spoke to St. Francis. But their ascetic existence has not shielded them from the effect of the recession that has increased the burden on charities around the New York region. Until this year, the friary received a yearly contribution from the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, one the seven charities aided by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
But overwhelmed by increasing demands and declining revenues, Catholic Charities has had to trim a number of their grants, including the $10,000 the friars received for their work with the elderly -- one third of their total budget. The money that used to be spent on such grants now goes to programs that deal with immediate food and rent emergencies.
"We had to cut anything that was not essential," Nora Murphy, a spokeswoman for the Catholic Charities, said in an interview yesterday. "That's not to say their work isn't essential. We're simply facing increasing demands for services, and more acute needs have come into the office."
The loss of the grant has begun to be felt. The brothers have begun spending more of their time and energy on the simple things they do to raise money -- bake sales, for example -- and less on the simple things they do to help their neighbors.
"We have to pick up the slack," said Brother Walt Hund, who heads the household, "and that takes away from our other ministries."
 
Left Teaching Posts
 The friary was founded in 1976 by Brother Walt and Brother Giles Naedler, two Franciscans who left positions teaching in Pennsylvania when they decided to adhere more closely to the example of St. Francis of Assisi. The pastor at St. Augustine's Church on Franklin Avenue, the Rev. Robert Jeffers, offered to let them keep an eye on the friary, which had just been vacated by the Christian Brothers. "We've been watching the house ever since," Brother John Kerr said.
The daily life is regulated -- or "contained," as another brother, David Leidl, described it -- by four daily prayer sessions in the friary's Spartan chapel, as well as evening Mass across the street.
"There are some people in the neighborhood who have more luxuries: a TV, a VCR," said Brother David, who joined the friary out of college in 1982. "We chose not to have those things, because that forces us to deal with each other and with God."
They subsist on donations and money they make selling bread, muffins and cookies they make in a donated pizza oven in the friary's basement.
Brother Gabriel Amato, who comes from a family of bakers, makes the bread for the sales. Brother Randy Hunt makes jellies and rosaries. Brother David makes their habits. Brother Walt makes their sandals. They all tend gardens around the friary, growing beans, eggplants, zucchini, peppers, tomatoes that they eat and give away in the neighborhood.
Father Jeffers, the pastor at St. Augustine for 22 years, said the friars are a "very visible" part of the church's work -- one that, unlike others, is there all day, every day. "They are the contact for the people who tend to be forgotten in the world -- the elderly, the shut-ins, the people who are invisible."
Brother John said it is difficult for people to understand why the friars would choose to live where they do. He said people sometimes describe them as somehow Messianic -- a notion he dismisses.
 
Offering Hope
 He describes the work more simply. "Hope is in such short supply," he said. "If that is something we can offer to people, then we have done our job."
Before joining the monastery, Brother John held a string of jobs editing trade magazines, the last one, Pest Control, based in Manhattan. He was a devout Catholic but felt no sense of calling. His sister, a nun, had once introduced him to the brothers of San Damiano, but it was not until after he took a long trip through Africa, where he was moved by a deep sense of love and community, that he felt a calling to join.
"I realized I wanted to change my lifestyle to be simpler and more loving," he said.
One day Brother John visits elderly people in their homes. Another day he delivers furniture or food to families. His work finds him as often as he finds it.
Jeremy's family, for example, found him, he said. Jeremy is one of Jose and Yolanda Diaz's 10 children. Mr. and Mrs. Diaz, known in the neighborhood as Bobby and Yogi, live with their children, three grandchildren and often "a couple of strays," as Brother John put it, in a four-bedroom apartment on Boston Road near the friary.
Brother John became a sort of confidant and friend to the family last year after a couple of the children tagged after him. Then one day, he said, one of the daughters, 6-year-old Christie, came to the friary and told him that her mother had sent her for milk for the baby. He sent her away, telling her that her mother should ask him.
Later, he learned that it was the girl's idea, not Mrs. Diaz's, to ask for the milk. "That really touched me," Brother John said.
"Wherever you could find a problem -- my landlord, my kids, my husband, food in the house -- I'll go to Brother John," Mrs. Diaz, who is 43, said Monday afternoon after Brother John's latest visit. "And he'll do that for me."
A few blocks down Boston Road, Brother John stopped to visit Mae Chapman, who is 88. ("I may be old," she said, "but I'm not cold.") "How are you?" he asked as he leaned way over to kiss her cheek.
"I'm aching," she said. She led him to a neat living room, where she talked about her ailments and her visit to the doctor's office for an X-ray. "The table was this wide," she explained, holding her hands apart and then spreading them further, "and I'm this wide."
Mrs. Chapman, who worked for years at St. Augustine's rectory, has lived in her city-owned apartment since 1943. She recalled how the neighborhood has changed, how the apartment has been robbed four times, how a man died of a gunshot wound on the stoop last year.
"Whatever has happened," she said, "I won't leave."
After about 20 minutes, Brother John and Mrs. Chapman bent their heads for prayer. Brother John opened his Bible to Isaiah, Chapter 35, and read:
"The desert and the parched land will exult. The steppe will rejoice and bloom. They will bloom with abundant flowers and rejoice with joyful song."

 CORRECTION:
A headline yesterday about the San Damiano friary in the Bronx and The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund misstated the relationship between the friary and the fund. The friary no longer receives money from the Neediest Cases appeal. Its yearly grant from Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York, one of seven charities affiliated with the Neediest Cases, was canceled, the charity said, so the money could be used to meet the rising need for food and rent assistance.
A drawing on Wednesday with an article about The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund carried an erroneous credit. The artist was Lloyd Stevens.

Some Small Signs of Optimism for Denver's Office Market

BYLINE: By Dyan Zaslowsky

DATELINE: DENVER

 BODY:
IN this city, where too many office buildings have been attracting too few tenants since the mid-80's, the Resolution Trust Corporation has given the market a lift by proposing to lease 148,000 square feet for its regional headquarters in Republic Plaza, a 56-story downtown building.
"I didn't know anybody could find happiness in having the R.T.C. around," said Kevin Shields, a Resolution Trust spokesman. The Federal agency was created to manage and dispose of the assets of failed savings and loan associations, many of which lent heavily to builders of the office space that is now in oversupply in much of the nation. 
 Once it consolidates in Republic Plaza, Resolution Trust will be occupying more total space than in the three scattered sites it now has in Denver. That, along with the expansion of the Federal Deposit and Insurance Corporation offices in the Denver Bank Building and an influx of small companies, is helping create a slow but steady recovery in the Denver office market.
Republic Plaza has 1.2 million square feet of space and is in the heart of the downtown financial district. When it opened in the summer of 1984 less than 20 percent of it was leased, according to Robert Sumner, general manager for the Canadian-based Brookfield Development Company, which owns and manages the property.
"The Denver economy had just crashed," Mr. Sumner said. Many of the oil and natural gas companies that Republic Plaza's owners hoped would rent space never signed leases. To encourage tenants, Brookfield Development and other Denver landlords offered attractive concessions to prospective tenants.
Over the last two or three years the building has maintained a 70 percent occupancy rate, slightly below average for downtown Denver. The Resolution Trust lease would raise occupancy to 82 percent in the rectangular white granite structure.
Mr. Sumner said space at Republic Plaza rents for $12 to $16 a square foot. When the building was planned, the developer expected rents would be twice that. Resolution Trust's five-year lease would gross Brookfield $8.8 million. The lease is still subject to approval from Washington.
Denver's office centers are principally in the downtown area and at the Denver Tech Center, a mirrored-glass office park jutting out of the plains southeast of the central business district. The Tech Center's vacancy rate for prime office space was 11.3 percent last June, according to data compiled by the Frederick Ross Company, a real estate concern; that compares with a 17.7 percent rate in downtown Denver. Space in the Tech Center leases for some $16 a square foot a year.
But Denver's overall vacancy rate, including less-than-prime buildings, is put at 23.7 percent. This is a drop from 30 percent in the mid-80's. The period of free rents to induce tenants to newly built prime buildings is past, brokers say, but vacancies are still high in the older buildings.
"Twenty-three percent when it is heading down looks a whole lot different from 23 percent when it is heading up," said Tucker Hart Adams, chief economist for the Central Banks of Denver.
Rick Pederson, senior vice president of Fredrick Ross, noted that Denver had no single dominant industry but was attracting a variety of smaller companies. One big company, United Airlines, announced last summer that it was basing 2,000 new reservations jobs in Denver, but most of the businesses moving in employ fewer than 100, he said.
In addition, more than 200,000 square feet in Denver have been leased in the last year or so by state agencies and the University of Colorado.
"At $13 a square foot, downtown Denver is a deal right now," said Sherman Miller, a senior vice president with Coldwell Banker, the real-estate brokerage firm.
Among the small companies that have opened offices in the city recently is the San Francisco-based American President Lines, with a staff of 40 at the Tech Center. Ivan Joens, service director, said that the container-vessel company decided to lease 12,000 square feet in the Denver area primarily because management liked the "education and motivation of the local work force."
Another small company that relocated to the area from out of state is Outrigger Hotels, a Hawaiian company that bought a 35,000-square-foot office building for $24 a square foot, according to Mr. Miller. Outrigger will occupy a third of the building and lease the rest.
"The healing process has manifested itself very slowly," said Mr. Pederson of Frederick Ross. "Office real estate alone is not a significant barometer of overall economic health," he maintained, but even on that score he said that he felt generally optimistic. The low cost of Denver housing and the existence of an educated labor force are major strengths, he said.

HEADLINE: NEW YORK FAILING TO USE $600 MILLION FOR WATER SYSTEM

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
New York City's program to upgrade its long-neglected water mains, sewers and tunnels has fallen sharply behind schedule in the last year because the city's Environmental Protection Department has failed to let more than $600 million in contracts for the repair work -- almost half of the money budgeted for the purpose.
While the city authorized $1.34 billion for water and waste projects for the fiscal year that ended in July, the Environmental Protection Department spent only $711 million, according to figures obtained from the city's Office of Management and Budget. 
 The shortfall in capital spending, the largest ever recorded by a city agency, comes as water main breaks and sewer backups have become routine in New York City, disrupting traffic and subway service and leaving residents without water for days.
 
'Unfortunate' Events
 Dinkins administration officials have been embarrassed and angered by the delays and have sought to focus the criticism on Albert F. Appleton, their Environmental Protection Commissioner.
Mr. Appleton, in turn, linked the delays to a number of "unfortunate" events, ranging from cuts in the crews that do street reconstruction work to the confusion caused by the relocation of his agency's offices.
But First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel recently demanded, in a sharply worded letter to Mr. Appleton, a more detailed accounting for the delay. Water and waste projects were given high priority in the budget while other city services and capital rebuilding programs were being cut to help offset gaps in operating budgets.
The delay, city officials say, will cost the city hundreds of millions of dollars for emergency repairs as aging pipes that should have been replaced burst. Scores of weakened water mains and sewers due for rehabilitation over the next five years are not expected to be replaced until sometime after 1995 and many pipes where work is being put off are expected to rupture during the delay.
The officials said the environmental agency's inability to let its contracts on time will have a high cost in another sense: the city is missing a prime opportunity to save money on construction costs, which are now extremely low because of the weak economy.
Finally, the failure to spend capital funds at a time of high unemployment has outraged contractors and disappointed officials who see such public works as a way to stimulate the sluggish city economy. Economists at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said the $600 million involved could have created 8,000 jobs.
The city is in the midst of one of the largest reconstruction plans ever undertaken. Since late in the Koch administration, billions have been budgeted to shore up the city's deteriorating infrastructure, from highway repaving to completion of the decades-old third-water-tunnel project.
While other city agencies have failed to meet their capital spending targets, none are as far behind as the Department of Environmental Protection. "We are very concerned that D.E.P. is as far behind as it is in capital spending, given the need for construction jobs in the region and the need to fix our water mains," said Rudolph J. Rinaldi, the city's Buildings Commissioner, who oversees all city construction projects.
Mr. Appleton said in an interview that the environmental agency has been delayed in letting contracts for the work because of a chain of "unfortunate" events, including moving the agency to new office space in Queens, changes in the city's procurement procedures that require more paper work, and a blueprint company that recently went out of business.
 
Perhaps 'Too Ambitious'
 The capital program, Mr. Appleton observed, was perhaps "too ambitious" from the start.
He said the rebuilding effort was also hurt by severe cuts in the Transportation Department's street reconstruction program. In the past, the environmental agency has scheduled its water main and sewer replacement to coincide with street reconstruction, but doing that in the wake of Transportation Department budget cuts has proved difficult, he said.
The environmental agency fell farthest behind in its spending on sewers and water mains. It was authorized to spend $209.3 million on sewers but let contracts for $76.7 million in the 1991 fiscal year. It was authorized to spend $315 million on water mains but let contracts for $56.8 million. On water control projects, the agency was budgeted to spend $700 million but spent $498 million, and for equipment it spent $28 million of the $58.4 million it was authorized to spend.
 
Dilapidated and Leaky
 The environmental department is also falling behind on construction of the city's third water tunnel, a 20-foot-wide shaft being built to carry water from the Kensico Reservoir in Valhalla, N.Y., to points throughout the city. The tunnel is to supplement the city two aging tunnels, which are now dilapidated and leaky.
Contractors, desperately seeking work in these hard economic times, expressed outrage that the environmental department has been sitting on hundreds of millions of dollars in contracts.
"When an agency as large as D.E.P. underruns its capital budget, especially in times like these, we get very upset because it's money that could be used to help stimulate the economy and create jobs," said Frank McArdle, managing director of the General Contractors Association, a trade association for the heavy construction industry.
Mr. McArdle, who served as the city's Environmental Protection Commissioner from 1978 to 1981, said that in the future the city might be less willing to allocate such substantial sums to an agency that has shown itself unable to spend them.
In fact, some officials at the city's Office of Management and Budget said there were plans to reduce substantially the environmental department's capital spending over the next five years because budget officials were convinced that the agency was not capable of doing the work on time.
Mr. Rinaldi, the Buildings Commissioner, said the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins currently had no plans to transfer the environmental department's unspent capital funds to other agencies that can spend them faster, but he noted that, given the city's fiscal crisis, the administration's priorities were constantly changing.
But Mr. Appleton said that his department had resolved most of its logistical problems in letting contracts and that the agency was moving quickly to get bids on contracts to take advantage of discount prices by contractors.
Mr. Appleton said, as he has in the past, that the department was doing more repair work than it has ever done before. He also said age was only one factor that contributed to the stress that can cause a water-main break. Congestion, vibrations from subways and street traffic and corrosive soil conditions are also factors.
But Samuel I. Schwartz, a former city transportation official who now is director of the Infrastructure Institute at Cooper Union, said every day of delay in reconstructing water mains and sewers meant another day of pounding by traffic and subways, further increasing the probability of a major break, like the one that occurred on 42d Street near Grand Central Terminal in October.
"One of these days city officials will realize that you can't ignore our infrastructure," Mr. Schwartz said, "but unfortunately it appears that that day will be too little, too late."

HEADLINE: THE EUROPEAN SUMMIT: Europe at Crossroads;
Leaders Return From Meetings Confident That Region Will Move Onward to Union

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MAASTRICHT, the Netherlands, Dec. 11

 BODY:
After the deadlocks, squabbles and veto threats that frequently marred their negotiations, European Community leaders returned home today confident that their two-day summit meeting here would be remembered as a turning-point in the region's decades-old integration process.
At first sight, it might seem more out of political necessity than outright conviction that all 12 leaders cheerfully asserted early today that they had achieved their main objectives, not least because France and Germany were aiming to speed regional unity while Britain was intent on slowing it. 
 Yet despite Britain's frequent isolation from its partners, despite the compromises needed to prevent a breakdown in the talks, in the end they agreed on a treaty that commits the 12 member countries to monetary union by the end of the century and for the first time gives the community a clear political profile.
 
Mitterrand Praises Accord
 The French President, Francois Mitterrand, tonight described the agreement as the most important in Europe since the 1957 Treaty of Rome created a common market. "A great power is being born," he said, "one at least as strong commercially, industrially and financially as the United States and Japan."
The German Chancellor, Helmut Kohl, a convinced "Europhile" who played a central role in building a consensus here, said he was sure "a federally structured Europe" was in the making. "If I weren't satisfied now, when could I ever be?" he asked. "We have made enormous progress."
The British Prime Minister, John Major, seemed more pleased that he had kept his word to his Conservative Party colleagues by not making concessions in key areas. But he too noted of the treaty: "It advances the interests of Europe as a whole. It opens up new ways of cooperating in Europe."
The new treaty is of course still only a blueprint, yet it represents an approach that has worked before: with Britain ever-reticent, France and Germany persuaded the community to set itself ambitious goals and even target dates with the hope that, in time, Britain would come around to accepting them.
Certainly, this is what happened after the community's last "great leap forward" in 1985. Only at the last moment did Margaret Thatcher, who was then British Prime Minister, endorse the decision to form a single regional market after 1992. Today, Britain is enthusiastically building what will become the world's largest trading bloc.
Indeed, it was confidence in well-advanced plans for the single market -- and the need to compete with the United States and Japan -- that led many community governments to support still greater economic unity by committing themselves this week to create a single currency and a regional central bank no later than 1999.
Britain was again the odd man out, insisting on an "opt-out" protocol that allows its Parliament to decide at a later date whether to replace the pound with what will become known as the ECU, or European Currency Unit. Yet many experts believe Britain will eventually accept the plan.
More important, though, is that Germany agreed in principle to abandon the mark, which is Europe's dominant currency, if a series of strict economic performance targets are met by community members. And German participation in a single currency will irrevocably transform Europe's financial scene.
 
On German Unification
 Germany's commitment to European unity is doubly important to France and other Western European countries that had initial misgivings about German unification last year. France in particular sought to accelerate the region's timetable for economic and political integration as a way of establishing new rules that would firmly "anchor" a powerful single Germany within the community. Many governments have been reassured by Mr. Kohl's own support for this idea.
After the "irreversible" decision to create a single currency, however, moves toward political unity this week were more cautious, disappointing such advocates of a federal Europe as Jacques Delors, the President of the community's powerful Executive Commission based in Brussels. Yet what was long a purely economic bloc has now also assumed political responsibilities.
At Britain's insistence, the 12 leaders dropped a planned reference to the community's "federal" vocation, replacing it with a commitment to "ever closer union." Britain also successfully demanded that, in most new areas of community competence, power will remain in the hands of governments and be exercised through unanimous votes.
On social matters, though, rather than accept a British veto outright, the 11 other governments decided to act without Britain, signing a separate protocol to the treaty that envisages majority voting on a broad chapter of issues relating to workers' rights, working conditions and social security.
Nonetheless, the summit sketched the outlines for closer political cooperation by committing the 12 countries to work toward common foreign and security policies -- to be defined through unanimity -- and to establish the long-term goal of a common defense policy.
 
9-Nation Military Pact
 Community leaders specifically agreed to assign a nine-nation military pact known as the Western European Union the task of elaborating and carrying out decisions on defense questions, albeit stressing that the group will remain closely tied to North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
They further agreed to coordinate their policies on police, judicial and immigration matters and, at the request of Germany, created a new regional security body to be known as Europol and gave modest new decision-making authority to the 518-member European Parliament.
While the community plans to review -- and perhaps expand -- its political competences in 1996, however, its declared aim of "asserting its identity on the international scene" will be increasingly tested in the coming years by the disintegration of the Soviet Union and ethnic unrest in Eastern Europe.
In recent months, for example, its efforts to broker a political settlement to the Yugoslav civil war have been repeatedly frustrated by cease-fire violations and, at times, by disagreements among community governments. At the same time, demands for economic aid from former Soviet bloc countries are increasing.
 
New Applications Considered
 Recognizing that it remains the main pillar of stability in the "new" Europe, the community this week therefore took the crucial decision of acknowledging that its membership will grow significantly in the 1990's. And as a first step, it agreed to take up applications for entry by Austria and Sweden as early as next year.
Watching from the sidelines, Norway's Prime Minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland, described this week's community treaty as "a milestone" in European history. Like Finland and Switzerland, Norway is contemplating seeking membership of the community. Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary have also signaled they hope to join one day.
Until recently, the community itself seemed divided over whether it should be "deepened" through accelerated integration of existing members or "widened" by inclusion of new states. With the new treaty, as Mr. Major put it early today, "the argument has been settled because we will do both."
Having spent some 26 hours around a table shaping the future, community leaders now face the task of persuading their parliaments -- and notably their public opinions -- of the wisdom of their actions. The current plan is for the treaty to be formally signed next February and ratified by all states before the end of 1992.
In this context, Mr. Major is perhaps surprisingly well placed, not only because he can boast that he did not accept a single currency, a social program or majority voting on foreign policy, but also because an intense public debate about Europe has already clarified the battlelines in Britain.
But no one faces a greater challenge than Mr. Kohl because only in the last few days has German public opinion suddenly awakened to the implications of a single currency. And to rub it in, he returned home to Bonn today to a huge headline in the mass circulation daily, Bild, that read: "1999 -- the End of the Mark."

HEADLINE: Crash of Private Plane in Georgia Kills 9

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ROME, Ga., DEC. 11

 BODY:
A corporate jet carrying five top executives of a supermarket chain crashed into a rugged mountainside near this northwest Georgia city today, killing all nine people aboard.
The twin-engine Beechcraft BE-400 jet crashed into a wooded area of Lavender Mountain, six and a half miles west of Richard B. Russell Airport, from which it had taken off at 9:37 A.M. The crash site is two to three minutes flying time from the airport. 
 The victims included the chairman and vice chairman of Bruno's Inc., based in Birmingham, Ala. The corporation, which had sales of $2.6 billion for the fiscal year ended last June, operates stores in Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Mississippi and parts of Florida under the names Piggly Wiggly, Food World, Food Fair, Foodmax, Consumer Warehouse Foods, Bruno's Finer Foods and Bruno's Food and Pharmacy stores.
 
Executives Are Identified
 The executives were being flown by two company pilots on an annual tour of some of the region's stores and were heading for Huntsville, Ala.
Among the plane's passengers were Angelo J. Bruno, the chairman of the company; his brother, Lee J. Bruno, vice chairman; Sam A. Vacarella, senior vice president for merchandising; Edward C. Hyde, vice president for store operations, and R. Randolph Page Jr., vice president for personnel.
Roff Sasser, an investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board, said at news conference this afternoon, that there were no survivors. He said the plane's flight data recorder had been recovered but officials had yet to determine what had caused the crash. Workers were going about the task of removing the bodies of the two crew members and seven passengers from the thickly wooded area of pines and limestone outcroppings.
"It is a very hazardous, steep and rocky area," said Mr. Sasser. "It will take us the rest of today and into tomorrow to remove all of the bodies."
Aerial views of the site indicated that only the plane's tail section was intact.
At 1,700 feet, Lavender Mountain is the highest mountain in the Rome area and much of the thickly wooded area is owned by Berry College, which is at the foot of the mountain.
Sheriff Mike Thornton of Floyd County said that his office was notified by the Federal Aviation Administration and the Air Force at about 11 A.M. that the plane was missing after taking off from the local airport nearly two hours earlier. Mr. Sasser said that area air-traffic controllers had heard no distress calls from the plane and there had been no witnesses to the crash.
But workers at a nearby landfill sighted smoke on the mountain's slope and alerted local fire officials, who had been called in to search for the missing plane. They found it at about noon.
Just six months ago another small plane crashed on Lavender Mountain, said Robert Skelton, director of the Winshape forestry center of Berry College. The vegetation is so thick, he said, that the wreckage and remains of the plane's two passengers was not found for 10 days.
Investigators had little information on weather conditions that might have affected the plane's takeoff, but Ernie Conner, who fuels planes at the Russell airport, described conditions as "marginal" for visual flying, with a cloud ceiling of about 1,300 feet and some fog. But, according to Mr. Sasser, the corporate plane was using instruments to aid its takeoff and flight to Huntsville and should not have been troubled by fog.
Bruno's, the Alabama-based corporation, has grown rapidly as an operator of traditional and large supermarkets and large food and drug stores. It has 241 locations, mainly in Alabama and Georgia, and is also a partner with the K mart Corporation in three hypermarket stores opened since 1989.
The company, which has 21,600 employees, had about $2.5 billion in revenue last year, or more than twice the $1.1 billion it posted in 1987. Bruno's expanded sharply in 1988 when it acquired 76 Piggly Wiggly supermarkets.
Ronald G. Bruno, the company's 39-year-old president and chief executive, issued a statement saying, "We are all deeply saddened by the tragedy that has struck Bruno's Inc."
 
Trading of Stock Halted
 The family of Angelo J. Bruno, the chairman and founder, who was 67 years old, owns 25.8 percent of Bruno's shares, worth roughly $260 million. Trading in the shares, which are listed on the over-the counter market, was halted after the company reported the deaths of the high-ranking officers.
The shares, which reached a record high of $21.625 in March, have weakened as the economy slumped in recent months. They traded on Wednesday at $12.50, off 37.5 cents, before trading was halted.
A food retailing analyst, Lee J. Wilder, of the Robinson Humphrey Company, a brokerage in Atlanta, said Bruno's had a reputation for strong and aggressive management. But like many food retailers, Bruno's had slower sales growth, and fewer new store openings, because of the recession this year, she said.
The deaths of the senior Bruno officers "is a terrible loss, but we don't expect to see any near-term impact on specific local operations," Ms. Wilder said. "Supermarkets are, by and large, locally operated, and the store managers and department managers are still in place."
In addition to the five senior executives, the others who died in the crash were identified as Karl Mollica, produce director; Mary Faust, an advertising consultant; and the two pilots of the company plane, John Tesney and Rob Stamps.

HEADLINE: THE EUROPEAN SUMMIT;
U.S. ENDORSES PACT ON EUROPEAN UNITY

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11

 BODY:
The United States today welcomed the pact by European Community heads of state to seek greater political and economic union, but President Bush warned against limits on American exports.
"The results of the E.C. summit in Maastricht represent a milestone which we celebrate along with our European partners," the President said in a written statement. "The United States has long supported European unity because of our strong conviction that it was good for Europe, good for the Atlantic partnership, and good for the world." 
 But he also urged European leaders not to exclude American exports and alluded to the trans-Atlantic disputes preventing the so-called Uruguay Round of talks from producing an agreement to reduce trade barriers. "This means working with us to bridge our bilateral differences, to expand an open global trading system by successfully concluding the Uruguay Round, and to avoid the dangers of protectionism," he said.
American officials and experts also said that while the agreement would mean closer trans-Atlantic political, military and commercial cooperation, the implications of a planned single European currency were unclear and could undermine the dollar's dominant role in international finance.
 
Trade Accord Blocked
 A conclusion to the multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade has been blocked for more than a year by a fight over the European Community's subsidies to agriculture, which the United States wants to reduce or eliminate. Julius L. Katz, a Deputy United States Trade Representative, testified to the House Agriculture Committee on Tuesday that disagreements remain over direct payments to farmers, the method of calculating cuts in export subsidies, a formula for changing farm quotas to tariffs, and the time period for these changes.
American corporations have generally favored continued European integration, although those companies with large factories and other investments in Europe have been more enthusiastic than businesses which rely on exporting from the United States.
American corporations with existing European operations are likely to benefit from the elimination of border controls and national rules that restrict, for example, the long-haul trucking industry, said Willard A. Workman, the vice president for international issues at the United States Chamber of Commerce. "Not having to unload things from a French truck to a German truck at the border represents a significant economy," he added.
All of the European Community member countries except Britain endorsed an agreement in Maastricht to seek a common system of social laws that would cover everything from worker health and safety regulations to "equality between men and women with regard to labor market opportunities and treatment at work."
The prospect of such a system has worried some American exporters, who fear that the European Community may seek to limit imports produced under less restrictive rules, Mr. Workman said. But the European Community, after briefly floating such an idea in the early 1980's, has not expressed any recent interest in doing so.
American environmentalists have sought similar rules barring imports produced by environmentally harmful methods, and European countries have been critical of extraterritorial application of United States laws.
 
Future Role of Central Bank
 American corporations with European subsidiaries have expressed few worries about the proposed system because they are already required to observe the same local laws as European companies.
Less clear, although potentially far-reaching, are the consequences of the European decision to seek a common currency by the end of the century. The structure of the European central bank responsible for issuing this currency will determine whether inflation in Western Europe is lower or higher, and this in turn will affect the ability of the United States to tolerate higher interest rates without suffering a devaluation of the dollar, economists agree.
If foreign central banks abandon large portions of their dollar-denominated assets, the dollar's value and role in international finance could suffer, although the Treasury and most private economists consider this unlikely.
American diplomatic contacts with the community have expanded enormously in the last two years and are likely to intensify as Western European countries seek to coordinate their foreign policies through the community's headquarters in Brussels, said an American official who insisted on anonymity.
Because each member country retains its own foreign policy, Brussels' growing role is likely to pose problems for American diplomats, said Alberta M. Sbragia, an associate professor of political science at the University of Pittsburgh who is writing a book on the subject for the Brookings Institution.
"We're going to have to deal with a system that is much more complicated than any other in world that I know of," she said.

HEADLINE: A Growing Choice: Housing or Food

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE

 BODY:
When Harold Coleman, a 23-year-old chef's assistant, sketches his family's budget, two figures command attention. He brings home $596 a month. He pays about $480 for rent and utilities for an apartment in Charlotte, N.C.
Those figures make the Colemans part of a large and almost certainly growing number of poor Americans who pay more than half their income for rent and utilities in a condition that is changing the way poor people live. 
 Experts dicker over the details, but the housing problems of America's poor have grown so severe that they lie almost beyond the realm of controversy, with virtually everyone agreeing that the problem is vast and that near-term solutions are so expensive as to be politically unimaginable.
"This one is so big and so related to money, it's not controversial because it's not even on the radar screen," said Representative Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat who is among Congress's foremost housing experts.
 
Official Recognition
 Asked if he agreed that the nation's poor faced a severe problem paying for housing, John Weicher, an Assistant Secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, said: "Sure do. We've been saying so for a long time. If you're trying to get a disagreement on that, I'm probably of little help."
A report made public yesterday by two Washington not-for-profit organizations is the latest in an avalanche of recent studies that paint a grim portrait of affordable housing for the poor.
The study, by the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities and the Low Income Housing Information Service, said 56 percent of poor renters, or about 10 million people, pay more than half their income for shelter. It put at 47 percent the proportion of the nation's poor renters who pay more than 70 percent of their income for shelter.
The Government considers housing affordable if it consumes no more than 30 percent of a family's income.
The report contended that the problem, which has its roots in the economy of the 1970's and early '80's, failed to improve in the seven years of economic growth that ended in 1989 and that it could be expected to worsen as the recession drives people out of jobs and slows the construction of housing.
 
'It Drives Up Hunger'
 Indeed, housing affordability looms so large in the lives of low-income Americans that analysts have devised a term to describe the condition of people whose housing costs leave them unable to afford other necessities: shelter poverty.
"It drives up hunger," said Robert Greenstein, the executive director of the budget center, which analyzes policies affecting low-income Americans. "It drives more of the poor into substandard and overcrowded housing and even into homelessness."
One measure of the problem's vastness can be seen in Mr. Schumer's tepid predictions for last year's National Affordable Housing Act, the most significant Congressional housing legislation in more than a decade, and one he helped design. The law creates a variety of programs to help poor people pay for housing.
"It will have a difference at the edge," he said, "but it's not going to change the direction of the statistics."
 
Geographic Diversity
 Since housing problems are caused not just by high rents but also by low incomes, they can be found with dismaying geographic diversity -- in the high-priced Northeast and West as well as in the inexpensive South. They afflict people who work full time, like Mr. Coleman, and those who rely on welfare; they trouble black, white and Hispanic people, young families and old pensioners; the urban and the rural poor.
Mr. Coleman earns $5 an hour making salads at a Radisson hotel in Charlotte, a city that has many empty luxury apartments but not enough inexpensive housing. Of Mr. Coleman's $596 in take-home pay, $415 goes for rent and about $65 for utilities, he said, leaving him a little more than $100 a month. "So once you pay the diapers and bus fare and electricity and the phone bill, there's nothing left," he said.
In the last several years, the Colemans have been evicted twice and arrested once for pirating electricity from a neighbor's outdoor outlet. Mr. Coleman said he ran an extension cord to the outlet to plug in his alarm clock after his own electricity was shut off.
Victoria Coleman, Mr. Coleman's wife, said she is not working because she would only pay for day care what she would expect to earn. Mr. Coleman, who is as earnest as he is poor, feeds the family on $323 a month in food stamps. He has decorated his living room with furniture found beside a nearby trash container.
 
Causes of the Problem
 "You wouldn't believe what people throw out around here," he said.
The problem stems from three main causes: The number of people needing low-rent apartments has grown; the number of those apartments available in the private market has shrunk, and Federal housing assistance has failed to keep pace with the change.
Since 1970, the report said, the number of low-income renters grew 41 percent, to 9.6 million in 1989. The study defined as low-income any household earning less than $10,000 a year in 1989 terms.
But over the same period, the number of inexpensive units available in the private market actually decreased 14 percent, to 5.5 million. They were defined as those costing less than $250 a month.
While in 1970 there were actually 400,000 more units than there were poor renters, the report said, by 1989 the situation had been drastically reversed, with 4.1 million more poor renters than affordable units.
The report cites a variety of reasons for the decline in low-cost units, including the conversion of rental units to condominiums, apartment operating costs that have outstripped inflation and urban renewal programs that have destroyed units.
 
Federal Aid Slackened
 At the same time, Federal aid slackened. From 1977 to 1980, the report said, the housing department added an average of 290,000 families each year to its list of those receiving housing assistance. In the last 10 years, however, the Government has added an average of only 78,000 families each year. Had the expansion of Federal housing assistance continued at the same pace, the report said, there would be an additional 2.3 million American families now getting help.
But even that would only begin to make a dent. While 4.4 million American households currently receive help from the department, an additional 9.6 million qualify. Waiting lists in some cities are years long.
Pointing toward numbers like these, some advocates for the poor have said that the only solution is to make housing assistance an entitlement, like food stamps or Medicare, that is available to anyone who qualifies.
 
Huge Homeowner Subsidy
 Cushing Dolbeare, a co-author of the report, has estimated it would cost $10 billion to $40 billion a year to do that. The study said the Government currently provides $37 billion a year in subsidies to homeowners, by allowing them to deduct from their taxes the interest they pay on their mortgages.
The report's data came from the 1989 American Housing Survey, a Census Bureau study produced every two years. It has been criticized for underestimating the incomes of the poor, but the survey also excludes the homeless, so its biases may balance.
One of the few bright spots, analysts agree, is that housing quality has substantially improved, with far fewer homes lacking amenities like indoor plumbing. But in some cases, neighborhood quality has declined, with many subsidized units located in violent, drug-dominated areas.
Mary Patton found that even in Charlotte -- hardly America's most blighted city -- accepting Government assistance could be risky. After raising nine children of her own, Ms. Patton, 49 years old, is now raising an 11-year-old grandson and a 12-year-old son of a friend.
She was paying $110 a month to live in a subsidized apartment, but after a shot was fired through her front window, she said she could no longer stand the drug trade. "I said I got to get out of here -- God forbid, they shoot one of my kids," she said.
She now pays $375 a month -- about half her average monthly earnings in a clothing factory -- to rent a modest two-bedroom home, where she sleeps on a couch because she cannot afford a third bed.
Ms. Patton was still saving for her gas deposit when the fall's first freeze arrived; she and the two children spent the night huddled together beneath the family's electric blanket.

HEADLINE: 73 Haitians Who Returned Home Were Rapidly Arrested, U.N. Says

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11

 BODY:
A group of 73 Haitian refugees who returned voluntarily to the Haitian capital on Dec. 1 from temporary haven in Venezuela were arrested and interrogated by the police on their arrival, according to officials in the offices of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees here and in Geneva.
The refugees were arrested at the airport in Port-au-Prince despite assurances given to the United Nations by the Haitian Red Cross that there would be no retribution. Initial reports indicate that all were released within 24 hours, but United Nations officials say they have no way of monitoring what happened afterward. 
 A small amount of money that had been given to the Haitians by United Nations officials to help them return to their homes was apparently taken from them during the course of the interrogation.
The fate of Haitians returning to the country they fled is at the heart of a court case that is to resume on Thursday in the Federal Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta. These Haitians are among a group of more than 400 who were moved from United States custody at the Guantanamo Bay naval base to Venezuela, Honduras and Belize.
The Bush Administration is asking the court to lift a temporary stay on forced repatriations of Haitians.
 
Others Seek to Return
 The State Department has maintained that there is no evidence that Haitians returned to the island by the Coast Guard are persecuted. The last forced repatriations took place on Nov. 18 and 19, before a Federal judge in Miami issued the temporary order halting the procedure.
The voluntary return of the 73 Haitians from Venezuela was the first such program undertaken since the judge's order. At least 20 Haitians being held at the Guantanamo base have also asked to return, United Nations officials say, along with some others in temporary shelters in Honduras.
The United Nations warns the Haitians of the risks they run in returning, but cannot prevent them from doing so. A United Nations refugee official had awaited the returning Haitians at the airport at Port-au-Prince, but apparently left when the flight from Venezuela was late. The official had not been advised of the plane's rescheduled time of arrival.
The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and human rights and refugee groups say that it is difficult to monitor the treatment of citizens returning to Haiti because transportation has been severely curtailed by a lack of fuel. The gas shortage results from an embargo imposed against the military leaders who overthrew the elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, on Sept. 30.
Many rights groups have ceased to function in Haiti, and the United States Embassy has been stripped down to essential staff, with no rights observer. Some nongovernmental human rights organizations in Haiti are operating with pared-down staffs and resources.
Haitians forcibly returned from the United States under a 1981 agreement between the two countries have normally been turned over to the Haitian Red Cross, which is now led by a doctor who has served at one of the country's most notorious prisons.
"The Haitian Red Cross is hardly an independent institution," said Kenneth Roth, deputy director of Human Rights Watch in New York. "Everybody is at risk. This regime is as vicious and lawless as any that can be imagined. It murders at will. It is almost preposterous to expect a government of that sort to respect international law."
Anne Fuller, associate director of the National Coalition for Haitian Refugees, returned on Sunday from a trip to Port-au-Prince. She said she felt a "pervasive fear" in the capital that she had not experienced on previous visits over a number of years.
"I felt as though half the country was in hiding," she said. "At least 100,000 people have fled a city of a million-plus. There is no transportation running." She said that Roman Catholic priests were being arrested and rectories searched.
Other refugee, church and rights organizations say that arrests and interrogations are commonplace, and though people are often released within days, many Haitians have nonetheless fled their homes and moved underground or to other parts of the country where they will not be recognized.
 
Food Shortages Worsen
 The 34-nation Organization of American States, which imposed the embargo to put pressure on the military rulers to reinstate President Aristide, recently sent a mission to Haiti to investigate humanitarian needs.
 The mission reported on Tuesday that shortages of medicine and food are apparent and that conditions of near-starvation could develop by January.
 It recommended that the Organization of American States take steps to insure that inoculation doses, essential drugs, and chemicals for purifying water are transported to Haiti before crises deepen. Humanitarian aid is not prohibited by the embargo.

Stations Suspend Reporting
 PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Dec. 11 (Reuters) -- The last two independent Haitian radio stations providing news coverage suspended all reporting today after an attack by gunmen forced a radio station off the air on Tuesday.
 After broadcasting reports of the attack on Radion Galaxie, in which seven plainclothes gunmen fired on studio equipment with automatic weapons and kidnapped the station director, Radio Metropole and Radio Tropic gave no further news.
 The move left the Government-run station with a monopoly on radio news at a time of rising tension over negotiations between the Haitian Parliament and the country's deposed President, Father Aristide.
 Army hard-liners are said to fear that the Parliament, under pressure from the embargo that is strangling the economy, is moving closer to an agreement that could pave the way for Father Aristide's return to power.

HEADLINE: Quayle Returns Critics' Fire on Conflict of Interest

BYLINE: By PHILIP J. HILTS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11

 BODY:
Vice President Dan Quayle lashed out today at several committee chairmen in Congress for raising accusations of conflict of interest against him and his staff, and said his Council on Competitiveness would carry on with efforts to reduce regulation of American business.
The barbs from the Vice President, who accused critics of pursuing a "negative agenda" against the American people, were the latest in a feud with Congress that has grown more heated by the day. It began with Congressional criticism last summer of the council, of which Mr. Quayle is chairman, and of its actions in revising Federal regulations after they had been written by the agencies charged with doing so. 
 Because the council's aim is to ease the impact of regulations on business, and because it operates out of the public's view, with no record of who influences its decisions, critics in Congress have called it "a shadow government." They have further asserted that it was created to give businesses another chance to revise regulations after they have already failed to make their case to Federal agencies.
 
Attacks From Several Quarters
 Six Democratic committee chairmen in Congress have begun attacks on the council and on Mr. Quayle: Representatives Henry A. Waxman of California, John D. Dingell and John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, and Ted Weiss of Manhattan, as well as Senators John Glenn of Ohio and Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts. On Tuesday, a former Justice Department official in the Reagan Administration, Cass Sunstein, said the council's operations, while laudable in purpose, were plainly illegal under the Constitution.
Last week Mr. Waxman and Mr. Conyers began to investigate the personal finances of the staff director of the council, Allan B. Hubbard, a wealthy Indiana businessman, and on Tuesday succeeded in getting him to agree to put his financial holdings in a blind trust and to donate to charity some stock holdings that have been questioned by the Congressmen as possibly conflicting with his responsibilities.
Mr. Waxman also held a hearing on Tuesday in which experts in Federal rules governing administrative procedures and conflict of interest said that the council was operating illegally and that Mr. Hubbard might be in violation of criminal laws concerning conflict of interest. Mr. Quayle himself, they asserted, was operating beyond the bounds of conflict of interest rules because he had large financial interests he had not put in trust while he worked on regulations that may affect them.
Today, in a speech before a food and drug industry group, Mr. Quayle attacked the committee chairmen who had criticized him, saying they were pursuing an agenda that risked the finances and even the lives of the American people by seeking more regulation.
He said the criticisms of the council were a purely political argument against what he called needed reforms in the regulations set out by Federal agencies like the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency.
 
One Disputed Proposal
 One proposal presented by the council that provoked a heated debate would make major changes in the way the F.D.A. approves drugs, allowing private and university groups, along with health agencies in other countries, to try to influence the agency's reviews. The proposal would allow private contractors to review drugs rather than the F.D.A., give data from some foreign studies equal weight with data compiled here in approving a drug, and allow early safety tests on humans to be reviewed by university review boards rather than the F.D.A.
Critics suggest it would simply drop the F.D.A.'s safety standards in order to get drugs on the market faster.
Mr. Hubbard announced Tuesday that he wanted to "put to rest" assertions of conflict of interest, and in a letter to Mr. Waxman said, "Both the Office of Government Ethics the Office of White House Counsel have reviewed my activities pursuant to your request and have concluded that the arrangements I took to avoid conflicts of interest were appropriate."
But, he said, "after careful consideration, I have engaged private counsel to immediately contact the Office of Government Ethics for the purpose of creating a blind trust."
Mr. Waxman said Mr. Hubbard would still need to remove himself from any matters connected with his businesses. He said creating the trust or removing himself from consideration of issues would not affect whether Mr. Hubbard was prosecuted for conflicts that had already occurred.
Also Tuesday, Mr. Conyers, chairman of the House Government Operations Committee, said he had asked the General Accounting Office to look into the matter.

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
Dole, Bush's Point Man in the Senate, Is Considering Life Behind the Lines

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11

 BODY:
Bob Dole did more with less in the last session of Congress, extricating his party from White House-made difficulties on civil rights and unemployment benefits. But the Republican leader of the Senate sounds tired of keeping the increasingly fractious, dwindling Republican minority together.
And if his party lost still more seats, the senior Senator from Kansas said in a recent interview, "about all you could do is frustrate the majority. You couldn't deal with them. You could frustrate them, drag things along, irritate people, which you'd have to do." 
 He added, "You wouldn't have much impact on the results, keep a lot of people awake."
The 68-year-old politician is on the eve of deciding whether to run for a fifth term, and he says he is contemplating what once seemed impossible: retiring from politics. His friends say he may seek the tamer pursuits of practicing law and serving on corporate boards.
 
Is Dole Irreplaceable?
 His Kansas colleague, Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, recently made public a letter urging him to run again. He was nearly irreplaceable, she wrote, both in the "frustrating and difficult" task of conciliation among Senate Republicans and in the role of a leader who "persuaded the White House to listen."
Mr. Dole earned such credentials through dedication to President Bush's interests -- even when other senators suspected that he was not convinced of the political wisdom of a White House position. "There has been no more effective advocate of the President's position nor protector of the President's prerogatives," said Senator George J. Mitchell of Maine, the majority leader, who credits Mr. Dole with the President's string of sustained vetoes.
"My job is to reflect the Administration view, get as much of their program as we can," Mr. Dole said. In doing so, he gives the public no hint of the disdain he showed in his own 1988 Presidential campaign and his bitter primary battle with Mr. Bush in New Hampshire. Republican senators say he gives them no hint either.
Generally Dole the legislative leader has much less of a sharp tongue, on almost any subject, than Dole the candidate. It's more responsible, but it may be less fun.
"I don't think he terribly enjoys being minority leader, and he enjoyed it less in the last year or two," said Senator Warren B. Rudman of New Hampshire, Mr. Dole's diehard ally in the 1988 primary there.
Pushing the Administration's view was a more satisfying job for Mr. Dole as majority leader in 1985 and 1986. But the 1986 elections put the Republicans in the minority, and their numbers shrank in 1988 and 1990. After November's election of Harris Wofford in Pennsylvania, the Republicans were stuck on the short end of a 57-to-43 balance in the Senate.
 
A Minority Leader's Dream
 "I'd like to be majority leader," Mr. Dole said. "Obviously you never know around this place, there can be big sweeps, but I don't think that's going to happen in '92, so I wouldn't want to lose any seats."
With still fewer seats, "you'd still have to make the same fights," he said. But the outcome would be obstruction, not influence, and even if this year was frustrating, Mr. Dole had a powerful impact.
On civil rights, one of the few important bills passed, he kept pressing for talks between the White House and Senator John C. Danforth, the Missouri Republican, whose summerlong appeal to his party to abandon the quota issue and work for compromise on the job-discrimination measure kept it within reach of enactment. But Mr. Dole also worked to keep Mr. Danforth from taking enough Republicans publicly committed to him to provide strength to override a veto in the Senate.
The Missourian was tantalizingly close. "You have to choose between supporting the President and Jack Danforth," he recalls Mr. Dole telling a Republican caucus.
Buying time by dragging things out on the floor, using parliamentary stalling tactics, Mr. Dole confronted President Bush and his aides with the uncertainties of the situation in the Senate. He assembled a group of uncommitted Republican senators whom the Administration can usually count on to visit the White House.
When several of the senators all but threatened to vote to override, Mr. Bush sent C. Boyden Gray, the White House counsel, to make a deal.
 
A Tactical Commitment
 Afterward, Mr. Dole loyally and routinely insisted that the votes to sustain a veto had been there all the time. But he does not expend much energy trying to convince people of that. Instead, he defines his function on this bill as beginning with being a bit uncomfortable at opposing the measure in 1989 and sustaining Mr. Bush's veto.
"From a party standpoint, it was not in our interest to get locked in," he said. "We had to bring everybody along fairly slowly; we had a few in our party who thought that would be the great issue, we shouldn't drop it."
On civil rights, Mr. Dole had no legislative ax to grind, though an inventive aide, Dennis Shea, kept peppering both sides with compromise suggestions.
But on unemployment, he had a counterproposal as soon as the first of three efforts to provide extra benefits for people out of work at least half a year came to the floor in July. The final versions passed last month.
Mr. Dole's commitment was tactical, not principled. Indeed, his was the loudest "aye" when the Senate passed the Democratic bill after rejecting his plan on Aug. 1. But the alternative provided cover for Republicans until the White House finally felt the issue's strong political winds and abandoned its arguments that the benefits were not needed because the recession was ending and that extended benefits would deter the jobless from seeking work.
"My view was 'We don't want to give anybody unemployment benefits' was not a winner," he said.
He conceded "it took a while to get it done," from July until November. What was in the final legislative package owed at least as much to Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee, and Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, as it did to Mr. Dole. And the House minority leader, Representative Robert H. Michel of Illinois, probably did as much as Mr. Dole to get the White House interested in negotiating.
But Mr. Dole kept the game alive, for the conflicting interests of Mr. Bush and his party. First he persuaded enough Republicans to cast a risky vote with the President to sustain an October veto. Then he kept demanding a compromise to protect Republicans from Democratic accusations that they had killed the benefits.
 
The Flow's the Thing
 But even if Mr. Dole is good at it, there isn't as much joy in influencing legislation as in controlling the flow.
He has been majority and minority leader under Republican presidents, but he envies the Democratic majority leader, saying, "I always thought the strongest position would be the position Mitchell is in -- to be majority leader when the other guy is in charge downtown, and then you can pretty well bring things to a halt around here."
His job is complicated not just by an insufficient number of Republicans in the Senate, but by the divisions among those who are there. Mr. Rudman said Mr. Dole is bothered by their lack of support, especially when other party leaders do not back him.
Some moderates believe that he neglects their interests in backing Mr. Bush. And so do some conservatives; when Senator Malcolm Wallop of Wyoming criticized Mr. Dole's support of last year's budget accord, Mr. Dole said that if Mr. Wallop wanted to be the party leader they could hold an election that minute. Mr. Wallop backed down.
Mr. Dole's sometimes sharp tongue occasionally makes enemies in the Senate. While Mr. Mitchell holds him in high regard for limiting the chaos that Senate rules seem to demand, there are other Democrats who have less sympathy for him as he routinely delays floor consideration of many major Democratic bills.
And if he could work to move the White House on some issues, he did not always succeed. He tried to smooth over the dispute over the rule barring abortion counseling by doctors in Federally financed family planning clinics.
But the White House, at the insistence of John H. Sununu, President Bush's chief of staff who is resigning, would not compromise.
In the end Mr. Dole's decision on seeking another term may well rest on numbers and his sense of how Republican Senate candidates may fare next fall. For now, he insists, "I like my job."
Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, one of the most enthusaistic Dole supporters in the Republicans' conservative wing, said: "I think he's really on the border. If the numbers were closer, I don't think he would quit."

HEADLINE: Legislature Drops Wage Tax by Vote Weicker Can Veto

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Dec. 11

 BODY:
The drive to undo Connecticut's new wage tax suffered a major setback tonight when the Senate passed a repeal bill by a majority too weak to survive a certain veto by Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.
The 21-to-15 vote, in a chamber that had been viewed by repeal leaders as the legislature's fortress of anti-income tax sentiment, technically keeps the repeal plan alive and sends it back to the House. But the majority was three short of the 24 votes needed to override a veto. The House of Representatives approved the plan by 86 to 63 on Monday, 15 votes short of the two-thirds needed to override a veto. 
 Repeal leaders had predicted a strong Senate showing of well over two-thirds that would swing some wavering House votes back into the repeal fold for a final attempt later this week to try to override Mr. Weicker and kill a tax that has sparked protest and anger across the state. But the vote tonight short-circuited that momentum, making the success of the override vote now an open if not doubtful proposition in both chambers instead of just one.
 
An Ambiguous Moment
 The final vote, which came just after 11 P.M. after five hours of debate, was an ambiguous moment of victory and defeat. The final speeches -- which were delivered after the outcome had been predicted -- sounded more like elegies than rousing battle cries.
"Connecticut grew and flourished," said the majority leader, Senator Cornelius O'Leary, an anti-income tax Democrat from Windsor Locks, in describing the years of Connecticut's pre-wage-tax innocence. "Connecticut can stand tall and proud and compare its record without an income tax to any state in this union and Connecticut comes out ahead. Let's keep that lead."
The bill, which would cut spending and raise other taxes to replace the wage tax, now goes back to the House because it was amended during the Senate debate. And an attempt to override is still expected, probably later this week. But lawmakers in both chambers said the dynamic of the special session had been changed by the Senate vote. Some Senators blamed the replacement budget itself, which they said they would have liked to vote for but could not.
The proposal would increase state borrowing and cut more than $200 million from this year's budget of $7.6 billion, including a $50 million reduction in the state's contribution to general assistance welfare. A legislative analysis also concluded that that plan could be out of balance by a $1 billion or more in just six months.
"It is not responsible," said Senator Amelia P. Mustone, a Democrat from Meriden who voted against the plan despite expressing distaste for the wage tax. "I can't lie to keep my job."
 
'Has Hurt Our Economy'
 "It's mean," said another lawmaker who voted against the bill, Senator Charles H. Allen 3d, a Democrat from New Haven. "It preys on those who are least able to defend themselves -- it hurts the weakest areas of our state in addition to the weakest people."
Supporters of the proposal conceded that their alternative to taxing wages was not perfect. But for better or worse, they added, it is what the people of the state wanted. And the income tax, they said, has been a blow to an economy already in a severe recession.
"It has hurt our economy, and our families and our future," said one repeal leader, Senator John B. Larson, an East Hartford Democrat and the Senate President pro tem.
The vote, which had originally been set for Tuesday afternoon, then Wednesday afternoon, was postponed again late in the day, as lawmakers scrambled to adjust their strategies about a repeal session that in the last 48 hours has departed significantly from the prepared script.
"The organizing framework fell apart," said Senator George Jepsen, a Democrat from Stamford, in the hours before the debate began. "Nobody knows what to do."
Mr. Jepsen, who opposes repeal and instead supports changing the existing income tax to ease the burden on middle-income taxpayers, said he and several like-minded Senators had planned a push to amend the plan today. But discussions through the afternoon changed that strategy, as lawmakers began to conclude with increasing confidence that repeal had fizzled and that not everything need be staked on one throw of the dice on Wednesday.
The amendment was offered in order to hold up an alternative to the plan being voted upon, then withdrawn. Mr. Jepsen said the income-tax repair plan would be brought to a vote perhaps next week.
Wage tax supporters in the House said that two weak votes in succession on repeal had significantly increased the chances of passing measures like Mr. Jepsen's. Many opponents of the income tax have said they would oppose any effort to change it or ease its burden because that would mean accepting that the tax is valid and permanent enough to consider tinkering with.
"A week ago I would have said we had a 30 percent chance," said Representative Miles S. Rapoport, a Democrat from West Hartford who supports amending but keeping the income tax. "Now I would say 50-50."

HEADLINE: Democrat Sees a Big '92 Budget Gap in Trenton

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 11

 BODY:
A major Senate Democrat says New Jersey will not have to wait until the next fiscal year for its economic picture to grow truly grim. By his calculations, the state could find itself $700 million in the red before this budget cycle ends.
Senator Laurence S. Weiss of Woodbridge, the Appropriations Committee chairman, who is considered one of Trenton's most astute fiscal analysts, said in an interview today that he expected a lagging economy to cause the state to fall far short of revenue expectations before the fiscal year ends next June 30. 
 "If I said a billion dollars, it would scare the hell out of everybody, so I'm saying about $700 million," Mr. Weiss said, a hint that using the lower figure might be optimistic.
He based his estimate on his scrutiny of tax collections through November and his own belief that the economy is not picking up so quickly as expected.
State Treasurer Douglas C. Berman, although reporting that revenues have generally been up to expectations this year, has also warned of potentially serious problems building as the economy continues to sputter.
Today, Harvey Fisher, spokesman for the Treasury Department, said that "revenues overall have been on target through November, and for sales taxes through October," the last figures available.
Mr. Fisher conceded, however, that "there is some concern about the economic recovery, and that is producing some anxiety about revenues in the months ahead."
Mr. Fisher said he had no direct response to Mr. Weiss's projection of a $700 million shortfall before the fiscal year ends next June.
A shortfall of that magnitude would be extremely serious in a total budget of $14.6 billion that has already been balanced by emergency procedures.
Senator Weiss also had news today about next year's budget, saying that he has the votes to send to the floor a package of bills that would roll back the $2.8 billion tax increase voted by the New Jersey Legislature last year. The package is up for a vote Thursday in his Senate committee.
Companion legislation to end the taxes on June 30, 1992, when the fiscal year ends, is expected to be introduced in the Assembly on Monday. But last Monday a similar attempt to introduce the "sunset" legislation was thwarted when Republicans refused to show up for a quorum call and six Democrats were absent, mostly because of illness, so no quorum was possible. The Republicans have been boycotting all sessions pertaining to tax cuts, and it is unclear whether a quorum can be achieved.
Meanwhile, Gov. Jim Florio, who pushed the new taxes through the Legislature last year, seemed to serve notice to his fellow Democrats that he might veto a tax rollback if Democrats succeed in passing it.
The Governor said on the Cable Television Network's "State of the State" program tonight that he had not prejudged the tax cut proposal and was willing to consider it if it comes to his desk. But he hinted that he would veto it if he decided it would jeopardize property tax relief and educational quality, both of which were the primary objectives of the $2.8 billion increase last year.

HEADLINE: PRETORIA'S AIRLINE HIRES FEW BLACKS

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: JOHANNESBURG, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Among the benefits South Africa reaped from the lifting of American economic sanctions last July was the restoration of landing rights for South African Airways in the United States.
Yet South Africa's state airline, which now flies three times a week between Johannesburg and New York, lags conspicuously behind the Government of President F. W. de Klerk in the dismantling of apartheid. 
 The airline's critics, including black job applicants who say they were rejected on flimsy pretexts, accuse South African Airways of balking at real affirmative action that would elevate blacks in significant numbers above the menial chores of janitors and baggage handlers.
"They are a highly discriminatory company that is putting all sorts of obstacles in the way of employment of blacks," said Papie Moloto, a human services administrator for the African National Congress.
 
11 Professionals Rejected
 The list of rejected job applicants include at least two pilots, five flight engineers and four aircraft maintenance engineers, all of whom returned from exile this year. Some were trained in Ireland and Nigeria and flew or maintained Boeing jetliners for Ethiopian Airlines.
South African Airways rejected all 11 applicants as unqualified, though the International Civil Aviation Organization had certified their competence. Some were promised a chance to start at the bottom as apprentices but have yet to be enrolled in any course.
A.N.C. officials related some of the alleged snubs.
In one case, a former Ethiopian Airlines pilot with 650 hours of flight time was told to log 350 hours more before reapplying, with no assurance of eventual acceptance.
In another, a maintenance engineer who qualified on the Boeing 737 jetliner in Ethiopia failed after being tested on a light aircraft he had never handled before. The Boeing 737 is the smallest airliner flown commercially by South African Airways.
In a third case, the airline took only one of 20 potential black stewardesses recommended by the African National Congress, dismissing most of the others because they did not speak Afrikaans fluently enough.
"If the standards are that high, we're saying, 'Why don't you prepare them for your standards? They are available,' " Mr. Moloto said. "This is what other companies are doing."
 
White Unions Blamed
 He blamed the problem partly on whites-only aviation unions anxious to protect white jobs during a recession. A white union official was allowed to sit in on an examination given blacks applying for jobs as aircraft mechanics.
The state airline said in a statement that "South African Airways has been committed to equal opportunity employment since 1983," after laws reserving good jobs for whites were repealed. The airline said its "ratio of black to white employees was significantly increased" but did not support this with statistics.
South African Airways failed to respond to repeated questions over the last month about the racial breakdown of its staff and professional training and bridging programs for blacks. It said only that 1,222 employees attended courses on "literacy training," "free market principles" and "bridging cultural differences."
Some South Africans, including Tony Leon, a white Member of Parliament, expressed surprise that the United States did not, as the Commonwealth has done, make affirmative action programs a condition of restoring the landing rights taken away from South African Airways.
"It is making no moves to align itself with the new reality in South Africa," said Mr. Leon, a legislator for the liberal Democratic Party. "As the flag carrier of the country, it's a remarkably unprogressive organization."
 
Questions in Parliament
 Mr. Leon asked Dawie de Villiers, the Minister of Public Enterprises, in Parliament what South African Airways was doing to hire more non-whites. Government ministers must answer questions from the opposition benches, so Mr. de Villiers disclosed these statistics in February:
*All but one of 736 pilots employed by South African Airways were white. The exception was of Indian origin.
*All but 50 of 1,443 flight attendants were white.
*All but 32 of 271 apprentices enrolled in aviation maintenance programs were white.
Mr. de Villiers gave no breakdown for other jobs at South African Airways. According to Zelda Roux, a spokeswoman for the airline, the number of black flight attendants increased from 38 to 60 between March 1990 and March 1991 and 64 other people of color were given administrative jobs.
"I certainly know of no programs or schemes -- and that's really what's required -- to make a positive contribution to employment opportunities specifically for blacks," Mr. Leon said. "They have that obligation and they're not fulfilling it."
Returning exiles with airline experience spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing any hope of eventual employment with South African Airways. One confessed that he questioned his own competence after his rejection.
"I'm very much discouraged about this," he said. "It's maybe better to take a course in computer programming or teaching."

HEADLINE: Republicans in Albany Propose Cuts in Medicaid

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 11

 BODY:
The Republican-controlled State Senate released a plan today that it said would slash $1.6 billion in spending on Medicaid and welfare over the next 15 months, largely by cutting services and changing eligibility levels for program recipients.
But in a vivid illustration of the philosophical gulf that has helped stall budget negotiations here, the Democratic-led State Assembly dismissed many of the ideas tonight as an assault on the poor and, in the case of one proposal to cap emergency housing grants, a means of "sentencing people to instant homelessness." 
 The Senate proposal was released as Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the legislative leaders continued to debate a plan that would simultaneously close more than $4 billion in combined deficits in the state's current $30 billion budget and its next budget.
John E. McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate Majority Leader, Ralph J. Marino, said the Senate plan would essentially freeze state spending on Medicaid and welfare at current levels, a combined total of roughly $7.3 billion annually.
 
A 'Day of Reckoning'?
 Mr. Marino hailed the proposals as a much-needed fundamental restructuring of social-service spending that could finally bring New York's budget problems under control.
"The day of reckoning is upon us," he said. But many advocates for the poor predicted that they would have the opposite effect, throwing the state's economy into further disarray and aggravating the fiscal problems.
"This is not a day of reckoning," said Russell Sykes, a senior policy associate with the State Communities Aid Association, a nonprofit group. "This is a day of wrecking."
It has long been clear that crucial to any successful resolution of the budget would be an agreement to halt Medicaid spending, now running more than 17 percent ahead of 1990 levels. But Medicaid remains one of the most politically polarized issues in the Legislature, with the Republicans seeking to protect health-care providers and the Democrats resistant to any reduction in services for the nearly 3 million poor and elderly who rely on the program.
Still, despite the differences, negotiators indicated today that there was a hint of progress in reaching agreement on general targets for spending reductions.
The Assembly, while falling far short of the $1.6 billion goal set by the Senate, has expressed a willingess to shoot for at least $1 billion in Medicaid and welfare cuts, some of which will affect recipients.
"We've come a long way in what we're prepared to do," said James R. Tallon Jr. of Binghamton, the Assembly's Majority Leader. "For the Assembly to talk about a billion dollars in Medicaid cuts is a big change."
But Senate aides said they were not convinced that the Assembly was ready to deal seriously with the issue. Unlike the Senate, the Assembly has published only a vague description of the cuts it would accept. "When we see anything from the Assembly that resembles real reform, it will be progress," said Mr. McArdle, the Senate spokesman.
Even if negotiators could agree on the outline of large-scale cuts in Medicaid, they would still face wide and bitter resistance.
"To think that we can just cut a billion dollars out of our health-care system and not have a tremendously negative impact on quality of life is insane," said Dennis Rivera, president of Local 1199 of the Drug, Hospital and Health Care Employees Union, one of the most powerful unions in New York City.
Here are some of the most significant cost-cutting measures backed by the Senate:
*Reducing grants to recipients of home relief, a welfare program for those who do not qualify for Aid to Families with Dependent Children, by 20 percent.
*Eliminating Medicaid coverage for sick-room supplies, ranging from aspirin to crutches, and limiting transportation costs for many Medicaid recipients.
*Requiring fingerprinting and photo identification cards for Medicaid recipients.
*Capping Medicaid reimbursement for personal-care services like the use of private attendants for those unable to care for themselves, at 120 hours a week.
The disputes over what to cut left little hope today of a quick solution to the budget talks.
For Governor Cuomo, events are compelling him to make up his mind about a Presidential campaign, which he has yet, formally anyway, to enter: the filing deadline for the New Hampshire is Dec. 20, with deadlines for a number of larger states coming just days after that. He has insisted that he could not run without some resolution of the budget morass.

HEADLINE: Foundations Bolster Fund For Neediest

BYLINE: By J. PEDER ZANE

 BODY:
Although most donors to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund are individuals who contribute $100 or less, many foundations provide larger sums in joining the effort to help the city's sick, poor and disabled.
Like many individuals and families, these organizations have made donating to the fund a holiday season ritual. The Starr Foundation in Manhattan, for example, has given money every year since 1983. This year the foundation, founded in 1955 by the insurance executive Cornelius Vander Starr, gave $150,000. 
 And like many of the people who have written to say why they felt it was particularly important to give this year, several foundation representatives said the prolonged recession has made them feel an even greater urgency to contribute.
It was that sense that prompted two foundations started by descendants of Robert Wood Johnson, a founder of Johnson & Johnson, the health-care products company, to make donations of $78,500 this week.
 
'Dig a Little Deeper'
 "It is a difficult time for many people who normally give, so we feel there is an even greater responsibility for those who can to dig a little deeper," a spokesman for the foundations, who declined to be named, said in a telephone interview.
Since it was founded in 1912 by Adolph S. Ochs, who was then publisher of The New York Times, the Neediest Cases Fund has raised money for New York's sick, poor and disabled. What began as the "Hundred Neediest Cases" has expanded to meet the needs of thousands of people.
As in the past, The New York Times is covering the campaign's overhead costs so that every dollar collected can be passed on directly to seven charities. The money provided many forms of relief, including food for the hungry, shelter for the homeless and clothing for those without.
The broad array of services that the seven charities provide led the Mary J. Hutchins Foundation of Manhattan to contribute $55,000. In a note accompanying the gift, the organization's vice-president, Richard J. Mirabella, observed that the fund provided programs "regardless of race, creed or nationality."
The Starr Foundation's $150,000 donation this year was the second installment of its three-year $450,000 grant. Its president, T. C. Hsu, said one reason his organization continues to support the Neediest Cases was the fund's efficiency. "We know that every penny will go to those who really need it, and in these tough times that's where it has to go," he said.

G.M. Hints Deep Cuts Are Ahead

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 11

 BODY:
Leading the latest round of corporate shrinkage, the General Motors Corporation signaled investors and employees today that deep cutbacks were in the works.
Also today, Xerox and TRW announced that they would make substantial trims. [Page D3.] 
 The Xerox Corporation said it would eliminate 2,500 white-collar jobs, or more than 20 percent of the total, by the middle of next year and take a $175 million pretax charge against earnings.
TRW Inc. said it would sell businesses worth $400 million to $500 million; cut capital spending by more than $100 million next year, or more than 16 percent, and cut 2,500 jobs.
At G.M., which has been bleeding huge sums from its North American operations, Robert C. Stempel, the chairman, said in a terse three-paragraph statement said that details of the cutbacks, which were endorsed by G.M. directors at a board meeting on Monday in Washington, would be explained publicly next Wednesday.
Mr. Stempel's announcement came in reaction to rumors sweeping Detroit and Wall Street, a spokesman said, which depressed the price of G.M. stock in the last week to a four-year low. G.M. closed today at $27.875, down 62.5 cents.
Analysts have been speculating that G.M. will be forced to close several assembly plants, dismiss thousands of white-collar workers and, perhaps, reshuffle its executive suite. They have also been predicting a dividend cut in February.
 
Paring Excess Capacity
 The latest move would be intended to pare excess capacity and thus improve operating efficiency. The excess capacity has resulted from the prolonged automotive recession, as well as G.M.'s failure to gain back any of the market share the auto maker lost in the 1980's. Personnel costs would also be lowered.
Most analysts estimate that G.M. is losing at least $500 million a month in North America. The deficits have been partly balanced by a strong performance by G.M.'s non-automotive subsidiaries and big profits in Germany, where the Adam Opel subsidiary is having a record year. Even so, G.M. posted a net loss of $2.2 billion in the first nine months of 1991.
Although G.M. remains financially strong, it cannot continue to lose such sums. Credit analysts say they are considering a downgrading of G.M.'s bonds and commercial paper.
After the G.M. announcement, the Standard & Poor's Corporation said it would "evaluate management's strategies for restoring the company's creditworthiness. S.& P. expects to conclude its review by early March."
Mr. Stempel's credibility with Wall Street could be endangered if he fails to deliver on his promise to increase capacity utilization to 100 percent by 1993. He has been in office about 18 months, during which time he has kept a low public profile compared with his predecessor, Roger B. Smith.
Until now, Mr. Stempel's style has been to improve efficiency slowly and methodically, but the recent erosion of G.M.'s standing in the credit markets may have prompted a move to bolder action.
"We've never been told how Stempel's going to do it," said John Casesa, an analyst for Wertheim Schroder & Company. "All the speculation without detail creates uncertainty, and the market doesn't like that."
Mr. Stempel, in his statement, said "the magnitude and timing" of an expected charge against earnings from plant closings and personnel reductions "have not yet been determined and will require further management consideration and board review." But he said he expects that charge to be less than the $3.3 billion pretax charge taken during the third quarter of last year to close up to eight plants.
Frank Joyce, a spokesman for the United Automobile Workers, said he would not speculate about details to be released next Wednesday; he was also not aware of any contact between G.M. and the union, which represents G.M.'s 300,000 hourly workers in this country. Union workers are largely protected from lost wages resulting from layoffs or plant closings.
Shutting plants now will be more expensive and complicated for G.M. than in the past. During the 1980's, G.M. closed and wrote off several assembly plants that were idled because the models they produced had been discontinued or were scheduled to be discontinued.
Today, the gap between G.M.'s actual production and capacity is spread among many of G.M.'s 32 North American assembly lines. Thus, said Mr. Casesa of Wortheim Schroder, G.M. must devise a plan to close plants and then move the tooling for some vehicles to other plants, where several models would be produced simultaneously.
Among factories analysts said might be vulnerable are G.M.'s Arlington, Tex., plant, which builds large rear-wheel-drive cars and operates below capacity. G.M.'s Willow Run, Mich., plant builds many of the same models as Arlington and could accommodate extra production.
 
Consolidating Midsize Cars
 Midsize cars built in the plants at Doraville, Ga.; Fairfax, Kan., and Oshawa, Ontario, which have been operating below capacity, could also be consolidated. And G.M.'s Orion Township plant near Detroit could be vulnerable if it is true, as has been rumored, that the new Cadillac Deville will be built at G.M.'s Hamtramck, Mich., factory.
Many G.M. salaried workers may receive financial incentives to leave, analysts said. The number of salaried workers dropped about 30 percent, to 100,000, in the 1980's, but the number is still too high given G.M.'s share of the domestic automotive market. Mr. Casesa estimated that the salaried staff could face an additional 20 percent reduction.
The most sensitive issue for Mr. Stempel may be that of G.M.'s top management. A G.M. spokesman said no top management changes would be announced Wednesday. But changes could occur as plant closings are announced. Historically, G.M. executives, unlike those of the Ford Motor Company and the Chrysler Corporation, have retained perks, benefits and job titles through good times and bad.
Until Mr. Smith retired, the supposition among auto analysts was that once he was gone, the succeeding generation -- Mr. Stempel and his "team" -- would be free to boldly cure G.M.'s ills.
To break with tradition and to dismiss or demote top fellow team members could be wrenching for Mr. Stempel. If it happened, it would most likely be done in consultation with G.M.'s non-employee directors, who have been taking a sterner, more active stance in recent years. In Mr. Smith's era and earlier, top management changes were normally influenced by the chairman exclusively.
Mr. Stempel has been invited to accompany President Bush to Japan in early January to discuss trade matters, but he is understood to be considering not making the trip.
At Ford today, the company's president, Philip E. Benton Jr., said his company did not plan any major cost-cutting moves in 1992 but would continue to cut its salaried work force and seek greater efficiencies, Bloomberg Business News reported.

Dividend Cut in Half By Caterpillar Board

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: PEORIA, Ill., Dec. 11

 BODY:
The board of Caterpillar Inc. today halved the company's quarterly cash dividend and announced the "probable closing" of a manufacturing plant in York, Pa.
The company, based in Peoria, also said it would consolidate its operations in Brazil, where soaring inflation has hurt the company's earnings. The cost of the plant closings would result in a fourth-quarter charge of $220 million, the company said. 
 Caterpillar said the board had decided to slash the dividend to 15 cents, from 30 cents.
The company has forecast a significant loss for 1991, with uncertainties for next year, because of a worldwide recession and a collapse in demand for construction equipment.
The possible York closing hinges on whether the United Automobile Workers union will agree to contract concessions to reduce costs at the plant. About 9,000 of the union's 16,000 members are idled by a strike, lockout and layoffs. The strike began on Nov. 4 after contract talks broke down.
About 1,900 jobs are at stake at the York plant, including about 1,450 union workers.
"If Caterpillar is unable to make sufficient reductions in the cost structure to make the business unit competitive, including the negotiation of an appropriate agreement with the United Auto Workers union, the business unit will be closed," the company said in the statement.
Caterpillar said the plant was inefficient and too expensive to operate under present conditions.
Another 300 union members work in the York parts distribution center.
If the York operation is closed, Caterpillar would phase it out by 1994.
The shares of Caterpillar fell 37.5 cents each today, to $39, on the New York Stock Exchange.

Xerox Plans to Trim 2,500 From White-Collar Staff

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
The Xerox Corporation said yesterday that it would eliminate 2,500 white-collar jobs, or more than 20 percent of the total, by the middle of next year and take a $175 million pretax charge against earnings in the current quarter to cover the cost.
Xerox said the reductions in managerial and support staff would cut its costs by $150 million next year and $200 million in 1993. 
 All the reductions will come from Xerox's document-processing business, which employs 101,000; production workers, engineers, direct sales and customer service staff will not be affected. The reduction will be most strongly felt in the Rochester region, which will lose up to 800 jobs.
Paul A. Allaire, the company's chairman and chief executive, described the reductions as part of "our ongoing process to create a more efficient, flatter, customer-responsive organization."
He said Xerox, which is based in Stamford, Conn., had decided to accelerate its restructuring because of the uncertainty caused by the weak economy.
"We would have done this over the next two years anyway," he said. "We think we have changed other parts of the company enough that we can do without some of this supervision."
Xerox's stock lost $1.75 a share on the New York Stock Exchange, closing at $61.125.
Some Wall Street analysts viewed the plan as overdue and overly cautious. "It's a first step in the right direction, but the company is still too fat," said Curt Rohrman, of First Boston.
Mr. Rohrman estimated that the reductions would cut Xerox's sales and administration costs to 32 percent of revenue from 33 percent. "Less than 30 percent is a lean company," he said.
Mr. Allaire agreed that Xerox needed to lower its expense ratio further but he said that there were limits to how much could be accomplished by slicing white-collar employees.
Xerox said about 500 jobs would disappear through attrition. The company said it was still uncertain how much of the remainder could come through voluntary programs, but some layoffs would occur before the end of the year.

This year has been different. Air fares this winter will probably be higher than a year ago, analysts say. A couple flying coast to coast today would pay at least $468 a person, or $378 after Jan. 15. One reason is that three carriers -- including Midway Airlines, which helped begin the two-for-one fare war last year -- have since gone out of business. And the surviving airlines, which are still losing money, feel more able to resist price cuts now that some competitors are gone. 
 Not only are carriers not reducing fares sharply at this point, but some are also even raising the base rates. The most recent fare increase was announced two days ago by Continental Airlines, which will raise fares $20 round trip on restricted fares as of next Thursday, those requiring Saturday stays, and on vacation fares purchased in advance. The carrier will also eliminate some one-way advance-purchase ticket categories that offered 15 percent discounts off full-price travel.
But if offers like the two-for-one fares are a thing of the past, industry analysts say bargains can still be had, although generally they are not as good as last year's rock-bottom fares, and they require more persistence in finding.
"The major airlines aren't advertising most of their bargains as widely as in the past, because they don't want to set off an industrywide fare war," said Tom Parsons, editor of Best Fares magazine in Arlington, Tex., which lists current travel discounts. "But they are offering more promotional discounts than ever in history."
Like its rivals, Continental is running numerous promotions aimed at customers of supermarket chains, credit-card users, even buyers of deodorants and shampoo. While these fares can save 25 percent or more on any ticket, in most cases they still are not as low as last winter's best prices.
 
Chapter 11 Airlines
 America West Airlines, which like Continental is operating under Chapter 11, offers a $298 round-trip fare between New York and Los Angeles or San Francisco. America West is also honoring a Continental coupon worth $50 that can be found in the magazine Entertainment Publication, for a $248 round-trip fare.
Customers of Furr's Supermarkets, a large chain in the Southwest, can buy certificates offering 25 percent off any Continental flight of $199 or more within the continental United States. Customers of Stop and Shop, a supermarket chain in New England, can save a like amount on USAir. And those who buy a "Home Alone" video can receive a certificate offering discounts up to $100 on American Airlines flights to Europe.
In addition, a Southwest Airlines promotion enables passengers to take a companion for free, while America West offers a free companion ticket or 50 percent off the passenger's own ticket to Hawaii. All those offers are freighted with restrictions, usually including advance purchase, a Saturday night stay and many dates when they are not valid for travel.
"A few years ago there were few such promotions," Mr. Parsons said. "Now we're seeing 20 to 25 new ones a month."
The reason is that they allow airlines to cut fares on a limited basis. Contrast that with November 1990, when American Airlines offered its frequent flier holders a chance to buy a second ticket on certain routes for $50. Midway Airlines quickly extended the offer to the general public, and before long most other airlines were giving the second ticket free.
In fact, the airline industry lost a record $4 billion last year, not only because of these offers but also from a doubling of the cost of fuel during the Persian Gulf crisis. This year, a year in which Eastern Airlines, Midway and Pan American went out of business, officials say the industry will lose almost $2 billion.
 
Strong Financial Pressures
 "We see air fares increasing next year because of financial pressures on the carriers," said Robert Harrell, a vice president of American Express Travel Related Services. Business travelers, he said, should expect about a 10 percent fare increase.
Even at that, the airline industry contends that it still has a lot of catching up to do. USTravel, a nationwide travel agency based in Rockville, Md., has calculated that 1990 fares adjusted for inflation were 18 percent below those of 1978, before deregulation.
One exception to the low-key approach to bargain fares is American Airlines' recently announced discount fares to Europe, during the slow travel season of Jan. 12 through April 7. The fares -- with the usual restrictions, and subject to availability -- are $318 round trip to Europe from Boston, $338 from New York, $358 from other East Coast cities and $478 from the West Coast, as well as Dallas/Fort Worth and Chicago.
Most of American's competitors announced similar deals, and Virgin Atlantic said it would charge $1 less than American from its five gateways in the United States.

HEADLINE: Japan Trade Surplus Grows

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 11

 BODY:
Japan's trade surplus nearly tripled in November, the Government said today, and economic analysts predicted international pressure on Tokyo would increase.
Japan's trade balance widened to a $6.56 billion surplus before seasonal adjustment, from $2.24 billion in November 1990. Japan's surplus with the United States edged slightly higher in November to $3.59 billion from $3.56 billion a year earlier. 
 "It shows a continuing reversal of the trade adjustment process and is bound to increase trade friction with the U.S.," said Marshall Gittler, an economist at UBS Phillips and Drew International.
Seasonally adjusted, the surplus widened to $7.45 billion against $6.44 billion in October, which was revised downward from the figure initially reported.
"It's likely to put more pressure on Japan to open up its rice market in the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations," Mr. Gittler said, referring to the current round of negotiations under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.

Tax-Free Fund Yields Fall After Increase in Demand

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on tax-exempt money market funds began to retreat in the week ended yesterday, after rising in the previous seven-day period, according to the latest figures from IBC/Donoghue's, which monitors the funds and publishes The Money Fund Report. Taxable funds continued their long decline.
"Recent rising yields of the tax exempts attracted investor attention, and the law of supply and demand helps explain the declining yields of the past week," said Walter S. Frank, chief economist at IBC/Donoghue's. 
 The total assets of the tax-exempt funds rose $1.9 billion, to $93.4 billion. The average days to maturity of the tax-free funds was unchanged at 58 days.
The seven-day compound average yield for the tax-exempt funds was 3.75 percent, down 5 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, from the previous week's 3.80 percent. The seven-day simple yield declined to 3.68 percent, also down 5 basis points.
The 30-day compound yield dropped t0 3.77 percent, down 2 basis points from the previous week, while the 30-day simple yield was also down 2 basis points, to 3.70.
 
Single-State Funds
 Among tax-exempt funds investing in individual state securities, the top New York fund was again the Salomon Brothers New York Municipal Money Market Fund, which reported a seven-day compound yield of 4.47 percent, up from 4.44 percent the previous week.
In Connecticut, the top-yielding fund again was the Prudential Connecticut Municipal Money Market Series with a seven-day compound yield of 4.04 percent, down from 4.16 percent the previous week.
New Jersey's leading fund for yields was again the Calvert Tax Free Reserve New Jersey fund, with a seven-day compound yield of 4.24 percent, down 11 basis points from 4.35 percent.
Among the funds nationwide with $100 million or more in assets, the highest yield performance was again turned in by the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund, with a seven-day compound yield of 4.74 percent, down 9 basis points from 4.83 percent.
 
Big Rise in Taxable-Fund Assets
 Mr. Frank said the total assets of the taxable funds rose a sharp $5.6 billion, to $478.1 billion, with $4.7 billion coming from institutional investors.
"This is a direct consequence of the recent Federal Reserve's easing of the Federal funds rate," he said. "This left money funds as the highest yielding alternaitve for cash assets."
The average days to maturity of the portfolio holdings were unchanged from a week earlier at 62 days.
The seven-day compound yield on the taxable funds was 4.73, down from 4.77 percent a week earlier, while the seven-day simple yield was 4.63, down from 4.66.
The average compound 30-day yield was 4.81 percent, down from 4.86, and the 30-day simple yield was also off 5 basis points, to 4.70 percent. Among the taxable funds, the top- yielding fund for the week was the Riverside Capital Fund of Columbus, Ohio, with a surprisingly high seven-day compound yield of 13.96 percent versus 5.96 percent a week earlier, attributable to its taking capital gains. Bank money market accounts, a main competitor of money funds, dropped to a yield of 4.59 percent from 4.65 percent the previous week, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index.

HEADLINE: S.& L. Industry Posts Profit For 3d Consecutive Quarter

BYLINE: By Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11

 BODY:
The nation's savings and loans not under Government control were profitable in the third quarter, the third period in a row in the black and the first time since 1986 that the industry has posted earnings in three consecutive periods.
"We are cautiously optimistic that this will be the first year in a number of years the thrift industry will have a profit," Timothy Ryan, the director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, told reporters today. 
 The savings associations earned $271.8 million in the third quarter, compared with a loss of $773.6 million in the comparable period of 1990, the thrift office said.
The improvement, which was attributed in part to falling interest rates, excludes the insolvent savings institutions that are being operated by the Government under a huge Federal program to close and sell failed institutions. There are 87 such savings and loans, out of some 640 that have failed since the cleanup began in August 1989.
The thrift office said that of the 2,148 savings institutions still in private hands, 86 percent were profitable in the quarter that ended Sept. 30, with a net after-tax income of about $1.4 billion. That was offset by losses of some $1.2 billion incurred by the remaining 14 percent.
Interest rates have been falling all year, largely because of the Federal Reserve's policy to make credit more easily available in an effort to stimulate the moribund economy.
As a result, savings and loans were able to charge, on average, a record 2.4 percentage points more for loans than they paid out on deposits, the thrift office said.
But those profits were largely offset by new reserves that the institutions had to set aside to cover potential losses on loans and by assets like real estate that are not earning interest.
Without Government assistance, the industry would not have been profitable at all. The industry's profits included $421.6 million in Government assistance provided under deals negotiated before the current bailout program was put in place.
Before the program is finished, taxpayers are expected to have to pay some $500 billion over 40 years, including interest. The Office of Thrift Supervision said second-quarter profits of the industry were revised to $275.4 million from the $386.8 million originally reported. Officials said the revision reflected amended reports submitted by the industry.

HEADLINE: Incinerators: Unwanted and Politically Dangerous

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TINTON FALLS, N.J., Dec. 7

 BODY:
This is where the voters of Monmouth County decided to save the earth.
After months of watching mothers in gas masks and riot gear predict apocalypse for their tranquil community, residents here last month rejected an incinerator that had been planned -- and approved -- for nearly a decade. It was the first referendum of its kind in the state, and it will soon leave this rapidly growing county with nowhere to put its garbage. 
 "The whole thing was a case study in hysteria," said Robert Collins, the County Administrator, who has supported both the plant and the county's aggressive recycling program. "We had the best technology and a perfect location. It didn't matter. It never does. What happened here will happen all over the country."
It already has. Opponents of a proposed incinerator at the Brooklyn Navy Yard have promised to block it with their bodies if they have to. From Baltimore to Nashville and Boston to San Diego, any politician who supports the burning of garbage risks political death. It has become Long Island's most powerful single issue. Last month, Assemblyman Lewis J. Yevoli ran for Oyster Bay Supervisor with a solid promise: no new incinerators. A Democrat in a Republican fortress, he won handily.
The Tinton Falls decision was typical of the opposition that confronts virtually every proposed incinerator in America. Yet even their most vigorous detractors acknowledge that, as the population grows and landfills rapidly close, incinerators have become critical, particularly in crowded cities with little land. Recycling has frequently been embraced as an ecologically sensitive alternative -- but even where it succeeds, recycling offers only partial solutions. Despite the controversy they cause, waste managment officials agree, incinerators have never been more essential.
"We can run from this some more, and we will," said Steven M. Polan, who recently announced his resignation as New York City Santitation Commissioner, in part out of frustration over his inability to enhance recycling or build incinerators. "But in this city we have more garbage and less land than anyone in America. We can spend every tax dollar we have to find a home for our garbage in the Midwest at the expense of police, teachers and hospitals if that's what we really want. It isn't a question of recycle or burn. We have to do both."
Incinerators are easy to hate. They are ugly, expensive and, with their smoke belching into the skies, present a convenient symbol for the degradation of the environment. But each American generates nearly four pounds of garbage every day -- in New York City, the figure is nearly twice that -- and as the country's population grows, its options have begun to vanish. Although environmental groups constantly warn that incinerators will bring increased health risks to nearby residents, most scientific studies contradict their assertions.
"There is absolutely no serious data to support the view that proper burning is dangerous," said Richard Magee, executive director of the Hazardous Substance Research Center in Newark, which is financed by New Jersey universities, businesses and government agencies. "They are regulated far more stringently than wood-burning stoves or cars."
 
The Advent of NIMTOO
 The issue has left municipalities across the nation flailing in political quicksand. Because incinerators have become so unpopular, few politicians will propose them. A new acronym, NIMTOO -- for Not In My Term Of Office -- has emerged to describe the paralysis. As long as someone comes to pick up the garbage, most civic leaders find other things to worry about. But by putting off inevitable decisions, most solid-waste experts agree, places from Monmouth County to Los Angeles end up spending millions in additional fees for landfills, incinerators or recycling plants.
Irrational agreements between neighboring towns have become common. On Long Island, Hempstead burns 200 tons of Huntington's waste every day. But North Hempstead ships its trash to Ohio for half of what it would cost to burn it in Hempstead.
In Tinton Falls, the $240 million plant would have extended the life of the local landfill by at least 30 years, according to county studies. Without the new plant, the landfill will run out of space by the end of the decade. The 1,700-ton-a-day plant would have become part of a comprehensive waste plan -- it includes a recycling center at the same location -- that has been in place since 1985, a year before the state began to require recycling. The plant would have generated enough energy to provide electricity to at least 40,000 dwellings.
In New York, Mr. Polan, the Sanitation Commissioner, has said that the city will have to burn at least 10,000 tons of garbage each day in several new or refurbished plants. The city produces nearly 27,000 tons of refuse daily, and has not built a new garbage-burning plant in 30 years.
The city exports much of its commercial waste to dumps from Pennsylvania to Montana. Of the 15 million tons of garbage sent across state lines in the United States in 1989, 53 percent came from New York and New Jersey. Congress may soon allow states to prevent such commerce, however, and that would hasten the arrival of a garbage crisis for the region. Currently residential recycling accounts for less than 6 percent of New York's waste.
 
Dinkins Changes His Mind
 During his campaign for mayor in 1989, David N. Dinkins thrilled incinerator opponents by calling for an absolute moratorium on any new construction. But with the city's recycling program struggling, he has recently changed his mind. Advocates of new incinerators, particularly the one at the Brooklyn Navy Yard that has been under study for years, consider his endorsement tepid. They say the city will need several such plants in coming years, and it will take a committed mayor to convince residents to support them.
Opponents, however, see the administration's change of heart as a treacherous retreat from its stated goal, recycling at least 25 percent of its garbage by the end of the century.
"The city has never even tried to use its marketing muscle to make recycling work," said John F. Ruston, an economic analyst at the Environmental Defense Fund.
It has become impossible to discuss recycling or incineration without discussing both. For incinerators to work properly -- at high enough temperatures -- they must use large amounts of trash. Often, however, the trash that burns best, particularly plastics and paper, also makes the most sense to recycle.
Advocates of a stronger recycling program say that if New York and nearby cities and counties paid more attention to developing markets for their recycled waste, they would have considerably less need to burn. Without a commitment to increase recycling, few paper-pulping or glass-grinding companies -- the companies that are needed to make it work -- are willing to invest.
As a result, none of the major environmental groups in New York will say publicly that they support new incinerators until the city greatly increases a recycling program that costs far more than initial projections and has struggled to attain its most modest goals.
"Incineration should be the last resort, not the first," said Eric A. Goldstein, a senior attorney with the National Resources Defense Council. "Only after we have implemented comprehensive regionwide recycling programs can we begin to think about it as an alternative." Communities that have relied solely on incinerators have been unable even to consider reasonable recycling programs.
Recycling has often been seen as a "green" approach to managing waste. But even when it succeeds, it can create problems.
Seattle and Newark have often been presented as models of appropriate trash reduction. Newark recycles more than half its waste and burns the rest in a modern incinerator that converts heat to energy. In Seattle, the American mecca of waste reduction, recycling officials cannot begin to unload all the glass, paper and plastic they collect. Paper that costs the city more than $100 a ton to collect, sort and process sells for about $10 a ton on the open market. If Seattle gets any better at recycling, it may be forced to truck recycled waste to out of state landfills.
"If you did this on economics alone," said Mr. Polan, "burning would be the only answer."
Yet disruptions from truck traffic and the high cost of incinerators -- as much as $500 million for a major plant -- scare many municipalities. Health questions persist as well.
But the risks of incineration, despite the often angry protests, are small. Estimates of the chances of developing cancer are often based on exaggerated assumptions. With incinerators, those assumptions often include breathing heavily 24 hours a day for 70 years at the spot where the greatest emissions fall.
With modern pollution control equipment, such tests predict that the chances are less than one in a million that the most heavily exposed person would develop cancer as a result of a nearby incinerator. A chest X-ray, by comparison, carries a risk of about six cancers in a million.
Burning what cannot be recycled reduces its volume by nearly 90 percent. The heat in new plants is converted to steam for electricity. Ash produced by combustion can contain unhealthy levels of heavy metals and other pollutants, but when deposited properly in a lined landfill they pose little danger.
"It is one thing to have legitimate objections, as many do," said Paul Casowitz, a former Deputy Sanitiation Commissioner under Mayor Koch who is now at Sieve, Paget and Riesel, a law firm. "But there are also those that take advantage of the fear. They have a political stake in creating hysteria. These are the guys who in the Middle Ages said, 'There are witches here, and I can find them.' As long as they have clout, this is a problem without a solution."

Fedders Layoffs

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: EFFINGHAM, Ill., Dec. 11

 BODY:
Seven hundred workers of the Fedders Corporation have been temporarily laid off while production at an Illinois air-conditioner plant is shut down. The layoffs were prompted by a seasonal reduction in demand for air-conditioners and slumping sales caused by the weak economy, said Barbara VanBlarcum, a Fedders spokeswoman. The workers are expected to be recalled on Jan. 6, she said. The plant, which makes room air-conditioners, was on a restricted production schedule because of slack demand. The plant, which closed last weekend, was also shut down at the same time last year. Fedders is based in Peapack, N.J.

HEADLINE: Court Setback to ZZZZ Best

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 11

 BODY:
The Supreme Court, in a case stemming from the financial collapse of the ZZZZ Best Company, today ruled in favor of creditors who make long-term loans to businesses on the verge of bankruptcy.
By a 9-to-0 vote, the Justices said Federal law does not automatically give financially distressed companies the power to recover interest they paid on long-term loans shortly before declaring bankruptcy. 
 The High Court said lower courts must decide whether such loans had been made "in the ordinary course of business." If that is so, the Justices said, the bankrupt businesses then may not be entitled to recover the interest payments.
The ruling is at least a preliminary victory for Union Bank in California, which is seeking interest payments that ZZZZ Best paid the bank on a $7 million loan before the company's collapse.
The carpet-cleaning concern was founded by Barry Minkow as a teenager in his parents' garage. He was sentenced to 25 years in prison for Federal securities, credit card and mail fraud violations in a scheme to bilk investors and banks of more than $100 million.
ZZZZ Best used a scheme in which money from later investors was used to pay early debts while nearly no work was actually performed by the company.
Union Bank, owned by the Bank of Tokyo, agreed to provide the company in December 1986 with an eight-month, $7 million line of credit.
ZZZZ Best made monthly interest payments totaling more than $270,000 until it filed for bankruptcy in July 1987 under the Chapter 11 provision
Herbert Wolas, a court-appointed trustee for the bankrupt company, sought to recover the interest payments to Union Bank and use the money to pay off other ZZZZ Best creditors.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled in Mr. Wolas's favor in 1990.
But today the High Court said Federal bankruptcy law does not distinguish between short-term and long-term debt.

HEADLINE: HOCKEY;
Islanders Are Staying Home, but Will Get a New Look

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
It isn't the sale to end all sales, but it has, at least for the foreseeable future, ended speculation that Long Island was on the verge of losing its only professional sports team, the New York Islanders.
The Islanders will remain on the Island, and their absentee owner, John O. Pickett Jr., will continue to hold the majority interest in the club. But starting in January, the full operating control of the franchise will be ceded to two local investment firms that have joined forces to purchase up to 50 percent of the team. 
 The buyers, Walsh, Greenwood, & Company of New Hyde Park and First Long Island Investors Inc., of Jericho, said Pickett's agreement to give them full managerial power was pivotal to the completion of the deal. Stephen Walsh, a managing partner in Walsh, Greenwood, and Robert Rosenthal, president of First Long Island Investors, will assume key directorial roles within the franchise if the sale is approved, as expected, next month by the National Hockey League.
 
Control Was Important
 "Operational control of the team will be vested in our two groups; to make the investment we'll ultimately have to make, we had to have that control," said Rosenthal, whose consortium has the option of acquiring a 50 percent share of the club within the next five years. "It's an investment that can make sense economically, philanthropically, and it's going to be exciting, we hope. But we had to try and separate the two things, being hockey fans but being businessmen, when we pursued the investment."
Their aim, said Walsh, is to first resuscitate the team's image and standing both on the ice and in the community, and then bring a fifth Stanley Cup to Long Island.
"We're not interested in financial leverage, we're interested in operating leverage," said Walsh. "The team has a tremendous history and tradition, and what we're interested in doing is coming in to turn something around: the model here is not that dissimilar to the Dallas Cowboys, a great tradition, and a great franchise that had kind of lost their way."
 
A Hockey Merger
 Although both firms had separately investigated the possibility of purchasing the franchise since Pickett announced last spring his intention to sell it, it was not until midsummer, when a conversation between Walsh and Rosenthal turned to business after a day on the golf course, that they combined resources and pooled their bid.
Pickett initially hoped to sell the team in its entirety for $70 to 90 million, but when no offers approached that figure, he grew more receptive to the notion of retaining his investment in the franchise while severing his responsibility for its daily operation. Pickett refused to disclose his selling price, which sources estimated at $25 to 35 million.
Walsh and Rosenthal said they were in full support of the Oct. 25 trade that was a face lift for the franchise, removing the malcontent superstar, Pat LaFontaine, and the Stanley Cup veteran Brent Sutter and replacing them with an array of younger prospects like Pierre Turgeon, Adam Creighton, Steve Thomas, and Benoit Hogue.
While a major renovation of the team's corporate and community marketing stance appears imminent, Walsh and Rosenthal said they did not expect to make wholesale changes on the ice. They implied that the jobs of Bill Torrey, the general manager, and Coach Al Arbour, both 20-year veterans of the franchise, were not in jeopardy.
"We are businessmen, and I don't see us getting involved with the on-ice side of things in the direct sense, except of course we'd like to win a Stanley Cup," said Walsh. "I have the utmost respect for Bill Torrey and Al Arbour: they've already done it four times and I assume they know how to do it again."

HEADLINE: Through Loophole In Tax Law, Art Gifts Pour Into Museums

BYLINE: By WILLIAM H. HONAN

 BODY:
The San Diego Historical Society already knows what it's getting for Christmas: a set of vintage Lionel trains. A museum in Rhode Island has asked for an exotic 17th-century Turkish towel. And the Whitney Museum of American Art has its heart set on a self-portrait by Chuck Close. At the Metropolitan Museum, it's been Christmas all year. Over the last 11 months, the Met has been given $28.3 million worth of art by donors, almost six times more than it received in 1990, including important works by Degas and Pissaro, and an outstanding collection of pre-Columbian gold.
The reason for this gift-giving bonanza is a loophole in the Federal tax law that permits donors of valuable objects to deduct their full market value on income-tax returns. The one-year "window" was due to expire at the end of this year -- thus, the last-minute rush of giving -- but has now been extended by Congress for the first six months of 1992. 
 The window was adopted last year as an experiment after congressional leaders decided that the 1986 Tax Reform Act might have gone too far by eliminating such deductions and leading to a precipitate drop in donations. The extension was passed late last month after a vigorous lobbying campaign in Congress spearheaded by the American Association of Museums. "Our victory was probably a result of being swept along with the tide of several anti-recession measures," said Edward Able, the association's executive director. But he said he expected "a terrific battle" in Congress in the spring.
 
Revenue Loser a Target
 "Many members of Congress now understand how valuable this tax break has been for museums," Mr. Able said, "but they also have to contend with the Federal deficit, and consequently any revenue loser is going to have an uphill battle."
In the meantime, museums throughout the country, which have been buffeted by cuts in government and private aid, are pleased about the opportunity the tax window offers. The Los Angeles County Museum of Art, for instance, has received more than twice as many gifts as it did in any year since the 1986 tax law took effect.
But the important thing, said Earl A. Powell 3d, the museum's director, is not the number of gifts "but the fact that many of them this year have been great masterpieces, including works by Giacometti, Rodin, Frank Stella, Clyfford Still and others: they range across all of our collections."
At the Whitney and the National Gallery of Art in Washington, the effect of the tax window has been accentuated by long-planned donation drives.
David Ross, director of the Whitney, said: "There's a rumor that Carter Brown convinced Congress to create the tax window to help with the celebration of the National Gallery's 50th anniversary. I don't know if that's true, but certainly the combination of the tax window and our own 60th anniversary has been extremely helpful." Mr. Brown is the head of the National Gallery. The Whitney has received so many gifts recently that it has had to postpone its new-acquisitions exhibition until May.
 
Gifts Galore
 Ruth Kaplan, a spokeswoman for the National Gallery, said that "while we'd love to take credit for the tax-window legislation, the fact is that Carter Brown, as a Federal employee, is not permitted to lobby Congress."
She said gifts to the National Gallery had soared this year, from an average of 280 a year between 1987 and 1990, to 1,514 in just the first 10 months of 1991. "Obviously," she said, "both the tax window and our 50th anniversary activities have had an impact."
Anne d'Harnoncourt, director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, said that an unusually large number of substantial gifts were still being negotiated, and that many artworks already willed to the museum were instead being donated because of the loophole. "It's been a splendid year," she said. "It was a spurring of generosity that was already there."
Smaller institutions have also benefited from the loophole. The Museum of Art at the Rhode Island School of Design in Providence, for instance, has received more than 2,000 gifts, an almost sixfold increase from last year.
"We're receiving a very important collection of textiles, including an outstanding 17th-century Turkish towel, pre-Columbian pieces, and a remarkable Italian velvet," said Frank Robinson, director of the museum. "The collection had been on loan here for three years, but when the tax window opened, we got it."
 
A Rise at the Getty, Too
 And the San Diego Historical Society received a multi-million-dollar donation of vintage toys, including a virtually complete set of everything produced by Lionel Trains and Buddy 'L' toys from the turn of the century to the early 1940's.
The country's wealthiest museum, the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif., has received only 15 or 16 donations this year, said Lori Starr, head of public information at the institution. But even that relatively small number, she said, is an increase over the "handful" of gifts received over the last couple of years.
Some museum directors have vigorously publicized the tax window. Lin Nelson-Mayson, curator of the collections of the Columbia Museum of Art in Columbia, S.C., sent letters to people who had lent artworks to the museum pointedly informing them about the loophole. "We enclosed a pamphlet explaining the law so that our approach wouldn't be a scary process," said Ms. Nelson-Mayson.
As a result, the museum was given a fifth-century B.C. Phoenician amphora that had been on loan since 1972, a collection of fourth-century B.C. Greek funerary objects, on loan since 1974, and many other works.
There is a dark side to all of this public largess, however, one that museum officials are reluctant to discuss for fear of discouraging potential donors. Many proffered gifts are not as choice as their would-be donors believe them to be, and so must be rejected. The museum director who looks a gift horse in the mouth, no matter how graciously, may live to regret having offended a wealthy patron.
Moreover, the process of acquisition -- which may involve authentication, cataloguing, conservation and storage -- gobbles up staff hours. Mr. Powell of the Los Angeles County Museum chuckled over the matter, and remarked, "That's a problem we look forward to dealing with!" But the fact is that many museums, severely pinched by recession-driven budget and staff cuts, are at a loss to find qualified people to handle the influx.
 
The Risk of Overvaluing
 Furthermore, even in ordinary times museums run the risk of being seen as giving lavish tax deductions to the rich by overvaluing their gifts. In one dramatic example, Jiri Frel, curator of antiquities at the Getty Museum, was relieved of his post in 1984 after an investigation revealed that he had encouraged donations by overvaluing more than 6,000 artworks received by the museum.
Still, museum officials believe that the practice of overvaluation, while rampant in years past, was sharply curtailed by the tax law of 1984, which requires that appraisals be made by experts with no connection to the recipient institution, and also subjects appraisers to stiff fines if they overvalue a donation by 150 percent or more.
"Some people will still try anything," said Ashton Hawkins, executive vice president and counsel to the trustees of the Metropolitan Museum, "but I think the problem of overvaluation has been effectively dealt with. Appraisers are on notice that if they go way out of line, they're risking their careers."

HEADLINE: Leap to Unity in Europe

 BODY:
A generation from now when schoolchildren study Europe's resurgence after World War II, they may well focus on this week's summit meeting in the Dutch city of Maastricht as a decisive event. Members of the European Community approved treaties that will forge common economic, foreign and defense policies. The idea is to propel Europe into the 21st century as a cohesive power able to meet economic and political challenges from North America and Asia.
Agreement didn't come easily. Bitter disputes, especially between Britain and the rest of the E.C., were only overcome by hard bargaining and compromise. That allowed each country to leave Maastricht a victor, and Europe to claim the biggest prize of all: enhanced unity. 
 The most important economic decision was to adopt a single currency, controlled by a central bank, before the end of the century. By eliminating separate currencies, the E.C. will strip away layers of unnecessary cost in doing business across the Continent. The only holdout was Britain, which hasn't decided whether it wants to discard its own currency, and therefore its own monetary policy, for the sake of monetary cohesion. Although Britain retained the right to keep the pound, few experts believe it will choose monetary isolation.
Also dividing Britain from its neighbors was the issue of a social charter -- adoption by majority vote of communitywide rules on, for example, minimum wages, vacation time, working conditions and labor-management relations. The Tory Government saw this as an imposition of expensive government mandates that would force British employers to lay off low-skilled workers. Britain insisted that such rules be adopted only by consensus.
Here, too, the solution was to let Britain opt out. That could be troubling; the E.C. fears that employers might flock to the country offering the least onerous regulations.
The U.S. will be pleased by the Maastricht treaties because they unify Europe in a way that virtually rules out a repetition of internal rivalries that led to two World Wars. And a unified economy should prove to be a prosperous economy, assuring the U.S. high-quality imports and a vibrant market for its exports.
Americans could have been threatened if the Maastricht conference had turned protectionist, passing rules that would have locked out U.S. goods and investors. But that didn't happen. Indeed, the E.C. decided that aid to specific industries will have to be approved unanimously. That's good protection against protectionists.
The treaties also outline sensible rudiments of a common defense policy, emphasizing that it will remain closely tied to NATO. And they commit E.C. members to coordinating foreign, judicial, immigration and police policies.
The language of the treaties is general, making their institution uncertain. But they are a grand foundation on which to build Europe's future. If European Community members proceed in the same spirit of constructive compromise, the next generation's schoolchildren will read about Maastricht as the prelude to glorious prosperity.

HEADLINE: Essay;
Gorby Invites the Deluge

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

 BODY:
Revealing the true colors of a tyrant, Mikhail Gorbachev now seeks to thwart the democratic will of the independent republics of his former empire by bidding for the support of the veteran Red Army generals.
He is responding to the declaration of independence and formation of a commonwealth by Russia, Ukraine and Byelorussia by encouraging what amounts to a military coup. 
 That puts the truth nakedly, but even his remaining apologists in the West cannot escape this fact: He seeks to enlist the power of arms to overrule the decision of elected representatives of the freed peoples.
The new line of our discredited stay-in-the-union set is that Mr. Gorbachev is seeking only to control the nuclear weaponry in four of the newly independent states, and that it is in the interest of world safety that the West discreetly support his struggle to maintain central Kremlin control.
The opposite is true. The danger to order in the former internal empire comes from entrenched apparatchiks seducing the troubled military. The resistance of the unelectable old guard to ineluctable change is the main source of instability.
What is causing the U.S. Ambassador, Robert Strauss, to bewail the "wild card" of the Red Army, and inducing our new Director of Central Intelligence to send solons to dictionaries with his predictions of "xenophobic atavism"?
Not the responsible and orderly transfer of power undertaken by Boris Yeltsin, until recently the object of scorn as a "buffoon" by Brent Scowcroft, Mr. Bush's much-touted strategic aide. Not the historic referendum for freedom by Ukraine, instructed not to indulge in "suicidal nationalism" by President Bush in his infamous "Chicken Kiev" speech.
On the contrary; the fears of upheaval and chaos being fanned by so many union-minded Gorbachevites are caused by the clique trying to exaggerate those fears to cling to power. In the French proverb quoted by Madame de Pompadour to Louis XV: Apres nous le deluge.
Consider what Mr. Gorbachev, reformer without a cause, has done in response to this week's swift but peaceable replacement of the Soviet Union with a commonwealth of the core republics.
He marched to the old Defense Ministry, reminded the generals that he still held the title of Commander in Chief and admonished Marshal Shaposhnikov for having prematurely welcomed the commonwealth's proposal of a sharing of "strategic military space."
If the Defense Minister had been Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, Mr. Gorbachev's first choice to replace the faithless Marshal Yazov after the August coup, few doubt that the Red Army chief would have saluted and obeyed Gorbachev orders to assert the Kremlin center's military control over the republics.
But Marshal Shaposhnikov was a Yeltsin choice, and is torn between protecting his sponsor and saving his officer corps from the hardships of demobilization. He temporized.
In the face of this threat from the old union's Defense Ministry, Mr. Yeltsin did what he did during the August coup: went publicly to the Russian regional commanders (and privately to the arm of the K.G.B. in Moscow now under his control). He promised "to make the life of servicemen better" to counter the Gorbachev bribes.
Thus has Mr. Gorbachev's appeal to military leaders increased the potential for civil war, even as he hints at its dire consequences. More likely, however, the Gorbachev military move has started a different kind of war -- a bidding war between politicians for the support of the military.
The first thing the new republic's economies need is a drastic reduction in military spending; the last thing needed is pressure to maintain expensive forces. But if you were a general, with your lifelong colleagues facing unemployment, wouldn't you play one politician off against the other?
Postponing demobilization takes food off civilian tables and prevents recovery. That is the terrible consequence of Mr. Gorbachev's latest grab for power.
Our diplomatists should stop wistfully dreaming of him as a source of stability and see him for what he has become in his final throes: a tinhorn despot reaching for military mastery; a source not of nuclear control but of civil upheaval; and a man trying to arrange a deluge to follow his certain downfall.

HEADLINE: Business, Like the Voters, Is Worrying About the Economy

 BODY:
To the Editor:
If there was one clear message from this year's election results, in New York State and across the country, it is that voters are worried about the sick state of the economy. 
 Just glance to New Jersey, where Democrats lost control of the Legislature, or look at local officials in New York who will be out of work come January. Look to the attention President Bush and Congress are now paying to the economy.
The business community is worried too. Our concerns only deepened with the news that New York State's potential budget gap for next year may be twice as large as earlier believed. Business leaders agree that state government needs major structural reform if New York is ever going to regain its fiscal health. And we agree that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and the Legislature need to make those changes now.
We also couldn't agree more with what the voters said on Election Day -- that raising taxes isn't the answer. After three years of crisis budgets, quick fixes and multibillion-dollar tax increases on everything from income to linoleum, New York's budget is still out of balance.
Look at the first seven months of this fiscal year. According to the most recent figures from the state comptroller, overall revenues from state sources are up 9 percent -- some $1.6 billion -- from last year. That's a nice boost in the pocketbook.
Though revenues have grown at nearly twice the inflation rate, the state is still broke because New York is outspending its income. Social services spending alone, driven largely by explosive increases in Medicaid costs, is rising some 16 percent over last year, or $1.4 billion.
More people are out of work and more people are sick and needing health care. While that's a sad and unfortunate reality of a poor economy, it's an understandable side effect. What's more difficult to comprehend is that our Medicaid costs had been growing at a horrendous pace even before the economy dipped.
The economy isn't getting any better and may be getting worse. New York State budgets for the last few years have been made on the assumption that recovery was just around the corner. The problem is that nobody quite knows where the corner is.
Clearly, elected officials in Albany and in local governments need a new approach. They need to break away from short-term, patchwork responses and to make major structural reforms for long-term solutions.
And they have to realize that voters aren't going to be happy with further taxes on businesses when they see those increases result in more job losses.

HEADLINE: SKIING;
Reading for the Best Line on Slopes

BYLINE: By JANET NELSON

 BODY:
By almost any measure, skiing cannot be called a user-friendly sport. Going up and down a mountain is simple compared with the logistics of getting there, tending equipment, taking lessons, eating, sleeping and snatching a bit of nightlife.
That's probably the reason so many books are written about skiing and so many skiers read them. They are keys to basic survival, or at least a reduction of hassles, and they represent a minimalist route to pleasure. 
 Recent book offerings bear this out with hardly any of the coffee-table variety, but plenty of how-to, what-it's-like and getting-the-best-deal books published in soft cover. As gifts, these books are appropriate for skiers from beginners to experts.
Two books, published annually, which promise to keep traveling skiers up to date are "Skiing America" and "Ski Europe" (World Leisure, $14.95 each) by Charles Leocha and a group of contributing writers. Both books are loaded with facts, prices and names to help skiers cope at practically all the major ski resorts in North America and the Alps. They also provide advice on choosing a ski package, getting around Europe and finding friends to ski with.
 
Resorts Around the World
 In "The Traveling Skier" (Doubleday, $13), Andrew Slough covers a selection of ski resorts around the world, telling of his adventures with style and refreshing frankness. Also, numerous boxes with practical information about lodging, transportation and other facets of travel are scattered through the text.
"The Insider's Guide to the Best Skiing in New England" (Western Eye Press, $11.95) by Peter Oliver has a more limited scope, but provides an insider's view -- warts and all. Besides essential facts, the Starter's Kit segments about each of the 22 areas offers advice and caveats for newcomers. Lots of opinion and even wit make this worth reading for Eastern skiers.
All of Vermont's areas are covered alphabetically and more or less equally in "Ski Vermont!" (Chelsea Green Publishing Co., $16.95) by Jules Older. The straightforward presentation includes history as well as facts and figures, plus some advice. The author knows his subject.
 
Focusing on the Lodging
 Marge Lamy has made the selections carefully in "Cross Country Ski Inns" (Snow Vacations, $16.95), so the author has few complaints about the inns in the Northeast and Quebec that she describes. Despite the lack of criticism, there are differences in charm and amenities at the inns as well as in the extent of the cross-country trails and facilities. After reading Lamy, readers will know what to expect. Color pictures enhance the descriptions.
"The Cross Country Primer" (Lyons & Burford, $14.95) by Laurie Gullion is described as a beginner's guide, but for anyone who aspires to mastery of cross-country skiing, this book offers clear and concise explanations of the sport. Beyond the most basic maneuvers, the author gives no-nonsense descriptions and exercises for advanced skills like skating and downhill skiing while wearing cross-country equipment. It's a useful self-teaching guide.
Another book that is appropriate for beginners, or at least those less familiar with skiing, is "The Snow Skier's Bible" (Doubleday, $12) by Peter Shelton. Practically every aspect of downhill and cross-country skiing -- instruction, equipment, weather, snow grooming, safety, mental attitudes, competition and exercises -- is touched upon, with some topics described in more detail. Photographs relieve the rather dry text.
Hal O'Leary, who has been a leader in teaching disabled people to ski, has written "Bold Tracks" (Cordillera Press, $16.95) to explain teaching techniques as much as to show handicapped people that skiing is within their reach. Approaches to skiing are described and illustrated for amputees, the visually impaired, paraplegics and people with practically every other handicap, with information about equipment and resources available.
Two books that take off-beat looks at the sport are "The Art of Skiing, 1856-1936" (Wood River Publishing, $19.95), by Gary H. Schwartz, and "Vermont People" (Vermont People Project, $35) by Peter Miller.
"The Art of Skiing" is a visual history of magazine illustrations and covers, advertising artwork and postcards over this 80-year-period, before skiing became a popular sport.
"Vermont People" is not about skiing, but about people displaced by skiing. Miller has composed a series of two-page essays, each with a handsome black and white photograph. They are stark portraits, revealing changes that have taken place in people's lives as recreation has grown to dominate Vermont's economy.

HEADLINE: KOREAS SIGN PACT RENOUNCING FORCE IN A STEP TO UNITY

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Friday, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Leaders of North and South Korea signed a treaty of reconciliation and nonaggression this morning, renouncing armed force against each other and saying that they would formally bring the Korean War to an end 38 years after the fighting ceased.
The agreement would also re-establish some measure of regular communication between the two countries, including telephone lines, mail, some economic exchanges and the reunion of some families who have been separated since war broke out in 1950. It would also commit the countries to rebuilding railway and road links across the heavily guarded border, known as the Demilitarized Zone, which has been the symbol of the armed division of the country for almost four decades. 
 Officials on both sides described the accord as the first step toward what they term the inevitable reunification of the Korean peninsula, but they conceded that it failed to deal with some of the most potentially dangerous issues dividing North and South, including Pyongyang's race to develop an arsenal of nuclear weapons.
 
'Milestone and an Evolution'
 At a briefing for reporters Thursday night at a hotel on the outskirts of Seoul, where the two sides have been meeting since Tuesday in their fifth set of high-level talks in 15 months, Lee Dong Bok, South Korea's chief spokesman, termed the agreement "a historical milestone and an evolution in inter-Korean relations."
In the accord, the two sides agreed to forswear all acts of terrorism or any efforts to overthrow the government of the other. They stopped short, however, of calling the agreement a peace treaty, saying that the armistice agreement signed in 1953 between the American-led United Nations forces and the army of North Korean President Kim Il Sung would remain in effect until it can be transformed into a formal peace.
For the United States, which lost 54,000 men and suffered 103,000 casualties before signing the truce with North Korea on July 27, 1953, the new reconciliation and nonaggression pact raises a host of new questions.
The most critical is whether the new North-South relationship will undercut the rationale for keeping 40,000 American troops stationed here, formally serving under the United Nations Command that directed combat operations during the war. In recent years, the United States has slowly been turning command of those forces over to South Koreans, but last month American troop reductions here were halted by Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney until North Korea allows international inspection of its nuclear complexes and dismantles a fuel reprocessing plant that could produce weapons-grade plutonium.
North and South Korea announced later today that they would conduct a separate set of negotiations over nuclear issues later this month, but North Korea did not indicate how it would respond to a proposal for mutual inspection of suspected nuclear sites on both sides of the border, including American military bases. In recent weeks the United States has been removing the nuclear weapons it has stored here for decades to deter a North Korean attack.
In Washington on Thursday, a spokesman for the State Department, Bob Hall, said that the United States had not yet received a copy of the accord. "In terms of what it means for our posture in Korea," he said, "I think it's at this point premature to say."
 
Caution Despite Toasts
 This morning, as negotiators for the two sides began to read aloud their accord in a meeting that was broadcast throughout South Korea, both sides said they would exchange radio and television broadcasts, newspapers and other publications, breaking their nearly four-decade wall of silence. But there were no guarantees that North Korea would allow that news to be disseminated in its tightly controlled society. Two days ago, at the start of the talks, North Korea's Prime Minister, Yon Hyung Muk, said he had to protect his "clean society against pollution by stinking, corrupt cultures."
While Prime MinisterYon and his South Korean counterpart, Chung Won Shik, toasted a new era of reconciliation at an elaborate Korean-style banquet Thursday night, others were far more cautious about whether the treaty would have much practical effect in reducing tensions. Past communiques and agreements -- though none as sweeping as this one -- have often collapsed amid charges of duplicity, treachery and provocation on both sides.
"It will not put most of the problems between the North and the South to rest," an American diplomat here said on Thursday. "But it might make people feel better. And it is something that they can point to as progress, after a year of serious talks."
Seoul was alive with speculation Thursday night about why North Korea suddenly seemed so eager for a peace agreement.
Many speculated that it signaled the increasing desperation of North Korea's Government, which is facing shortages of food and fuel, a disastrous harvest, an economy on the brink of collapse, virtual abandonment by its Soviet allies, and increasing international pressure to abandon its nuclear plans.
"The key here is that they want to buy time," said Yang Sung Chul, a professor of political science at Kyung Hee University. "The North's leaders need to show some evidence of positive action so that they can ease the pressure on the nuclear project, and so that they can make some progress with Japan and the United States." Japan is viewed as North Korea's best hope for aid and basic industry, although it has said that it will provide neither until Pyongyang allows inspection of its nuclear plants, which experts say could produce a weapon in one to three years.
North and South Korea have argued over nonaggression pacts on and off for almost four decades, with the North demanding -- until Thursday morning -- that it also negotiate directly with the United States, which signed the 1953 armistice. American officials have always refused, viewing the North Korean insistence as a transparent effort to cast the South as an American lackey. South Korea has harbored its own fears about a nonaggression pact, worrying that it would pave the way for North Korea to demand the removal of American forces stationed here.
As part of the accord, the two Koreas agreed to replace the armistice with what the South Korean press termed a "peace regime," with a North-South liaison office set up at the village of Panmunjom, along the armed and mined demilitarized zone. Tens of thousands of troops are still massed on either side of the zone, which over the years has been the site of periodic violence, including ambushes, infiltration attempts and the ax murders of two United States Army officers in 1976.
South Korea, too, is under some pressure to make progress in its relations with the North, though much of the pressure is internal. President Roh Tae Woo, the former Army general who was elected president four years ago and has slowly edged the country away from ironclad rule, is eager to arrange the first summit between a South Korean president and Mr. Kim, the North's aging leader. Within Mr. Roh's Democratic Liberal Party, there is also considerable maneuvering among those who hope to succeed him as President, and the talks with the North are something that each contender wants to leave his fingerprints on.
 
Talks Very Personal
 News of the accord bolted through Seoul at rush hour Thursday night, as commuters and shoppers gathered around department-store television sets. For millions of South Koreans the negotiations are very personal: Many middle-aged and elderly people here were born in the North but have been unable to return.
"I want so much to go back and see if any of my brothers are alive," a middle-aged Korean woman visiting here from her home in Hawaii said the day the talks began. "But," she added, with the caution that usually follows such conversations here, "I don't really have much hope that it will be possible." The country has been divided since 1945.
In a few ways, the negotiations are trailing the everyday realities of life on the Korean peninsula. Several prominent South Korean businessmen visited the North recently -- a delegation from the giant Samsung conglomerate is there now -- to discuss the opening of trade, something the two sides have virtually prohibited. Seoul's stock market soared on Thursday as word that the talks were making progress spread from the conference room.
The talks have also been a chance for South Korea to show off its wealth to its impoverished relative, and the country was not about to lose the opportunity.
Visiting North Korean journalists were given a tour of the Seoul subway. Dignitaries wandered through the Samsung production lines, watching VCR's under construction. There was a musical at the National Theater -- Mr. Chung and Mr. Yon sat together -- and Thursday afternoon Mr. Yon walked through a crowded department store, a symbol of South Korea's phenomenal growth and rampant consumerism.
But beneath the veneers of civility lies a deep distrust. Older residents still remember the bitter battles that left Seoul in ruins -- the capital changed hands four times -- and more recent acts of terrorism, like the North Korean effort to kill the South's cabinet during a visit to Burma, now Myanmar, in 1983. Seventeen South Koreans, incuding four cabinet members, were killed in the attack. North Korean agents were also responsible for blowing up a Korean Airlines jet in 1983, killing all aboard.
The accord, formally named the "Agreement on Reconciliation, Nonaggression, Exchange and Cooperation," makes no mention of whether mutual force reductions will occur along the DMZ. However, it does call for talks over "phased reductions in armaments, including the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and surprise attack capabilities."
North Korea made no public response on Thursday to a proposal by South Korea and the United States that the North open its doors to nuclear inspection, in return for rights to visit military and civilian sites in the South. The inspections are part of an effort to demonstrate that South Korea is now approaching "nuclear free" status. The proposal also would require both sides to abandon any effort to reprocess nuclear fuel, a commitment the South has already made.
In the agreement signed this morning, the two sides said that from this point forward, "differences of opinion and disputes arising between the two parties shall be peacefully resolved through dialogue and negotiations." They also agreed to create a joint military committee within three months. They also said they would install an emergency telephone line "to prevent accidental armed clashes."
The vaguest sections of the agreement commit the two sides to carry out scientific, cultural and sports exchanges, and to permit ordinary Koreans on both sides of the border to correspond and visit with their families. Until now, South Korea has sharply limited visits to the North and harshly punished students and others who have traveled there without permission.

HEADLINE: SOVIET DISARRY;
Baker Presents Steps to Aid Transition by Soviets

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d laid out an American plan today for dealing with the collapse of the Soviet Union, including a call for an international conference in Washington in January to divide responsibilities between different nations to deal with the needs of a "disoriented and confused" Soviet people.
In a 50-minute address at Princeton University, Mr. Baker outlined a series of steps that Washington would take to help dismantle Soviet nuclear weapons, stabilize the economy, establish democratic institutions and overcome food and medical shortages. But there was no call for a significant increase in United States funds for the former Soviet Union. 
 The first new concrete step, starting next week, will be an airlift by the United States Air Force of food to Moscow, St. Petersburg and other hard-hit cities, using military ration packets left over from the Persian Gulf war.
"If during the cold war we faced each other as two scorpions in a bottle, now the Western nations and the former Soviet republics stand as awkward climbers on a steep mountain," Mr. Baker said. "Held together by a single rope, a fall toward fascism or anarchy in the former Soviet Union will pull the West down, too. Yet, a strong a steady pull by the West now can help them to gain their footing." [Excerpts, page A24.]
Nevertheless, the specific steps that Mr. Baker outlined, while wide-ranging, seemed small compared with the huge problems in the Soviet Union, and the goals he set for the United States. He stressed that no nation alone had the resources to recast the wreckage of the Soviet empire.
 
Destroying Atomic Weapons
 While his speech combined some new proposals with some longstanding initiatives, few involved new outlays of American money, and even those were relatively small sums. The speech was primarily meant, it appears, to give more coherence to American policy toward events in the Soviet Union at this time of rapid transition.
Besides the international conference, among the other proposals made by Mr. Baker was an announcement that the Administration would draw on the $400 million appropriated by Congress to assist the Soviets in destroying their nuclear weapons, and would be sending teams of experts to brief leaders of each republic on the sorts of controls that the international community will expect to insure that the loosened central controls do not lead to a spread of weapons abroad. Washington will also ask Congress for $100 million more next year to stimulate private capitalist businesses in the republics.
President Bush today appointed Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger to coordinate all of the assistance programs for the Soviet Union, as he has been doing for Eastern Europe.
Mr. Baker's speech, which included some ideas that the Democrats have been pressing for months, marked the first time that any Administration official had argued that chaos among the Soviet republics could drag the West down as well. This appeared to be intended in part to explain to the American public why at a time of economic hardship at home Washington is spending any money at all trying to help its former Communist enemies.
Administration officials admit that helping the Soviet republics now is much more complicated than before. It involves getting into factories and changing their production, distributing food on local levels, keeping track of mobile missiles despite disintegration in the Soviet Army and giving birth to capitalist enterprises -- not simply cutting a deal with one man in the Kremlin.
Mr. Baker said the $100 million for new technical assistance to promote capitalism in the republics, which seemed to represent the biggest new outlay in his speech, "will, of course, not come from domestic accounts but from assistance to other foreign nations." He added, "Given the gravity of the situation, there is no other choice."
This is an important point, because what Mr. Baker was signaling for the first time was that the former Soviet republics -- for whom American foreign aid would have been unthinkable five years ago -- will now be competing for a shrinking American foreign aid budget, and one of the traditional big recipients, like the Philippines, the African bloc, Israel or Egypt, is probably going to have to pay.
 
Referring to Kennan
 Mr. Baker opened the speech, titled "America and the Collapse of the Soviet Empire: What Has to Be Done," by referring to George F. Kennan, who was in the audience and whose 1947 call for containing the Communist Soviet Union until it crumbled from within set the parameters of American foreign policy for the last four decades.
In evoking Mr. Kennan, Mr. Baker suggested that this speech marked an effort by the Administration to form a new approach for dealing with the emerging countries and territories that once formed the Soviet Union.
"What I present to you today is not a fixed blueprint," said Mr. Baker. "Rather, it is the principles and approaches which together define an agenda for action in a revolutionary, unpredictable situation -- a situation in which the West can play an important supporting role."
The Secretary, who leaves for a tour of Soviet republics on Saturday, maintained the Administration's hands-off approach to the current internal power struggle between the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin.
"We will work with those republics and any common entity which commit to responsible security policies, democratic political practices and free market economics," he said. "Fortunately, new leaders are emerging who are committed to these principles."
Those republican governments taking an undemocratic course -- and Mr. Baker singled out Georgia -- will not receive Western support.
In terms of economic aid, Mr. Baker argued that the "wreckage of Communism" was too large for any one nation to alone repair, so Mr. Bush "proposes that we begin by holding a coordinating conference to better divide our labor and responsibilities to help meet immediate and drastically increasing Soviet humanitarian needs."
He said the United States would invite the advanced industrial democracies, the Central and Eastern European countries, the members of the Persian Gulf war coalition, like Saudi Arabia, and the international financial institutions to come together in Washington in early January "to discuss how best to meet ongoing humanitarian needs over the course of the next year."
 
Shape of Conference
 This proposal is still in its infancy and it is not clear whether this conference would be at the head of state, foreign ministers or experts level, let alone whether the Europeans would be prepared to take part.
On its own, Mr. Baker said, the Administration will work with Congress to expand the Peace Corps program so that by next winter 250 American volunteers will be on the ground in at least four different republics, and will expand the Commerce Department's Business Training Program to accommodate 150 Soviets in the coming year. This is in addition to various humanitarian aid programs totaling about $4 billion in the last two years.
In the arms control field, Mr. Baker said the United States did not want to see any "new nuclear weapons states" emerge from the transformed Soviet Union. That means those republics in which Soviet nuclear weapons are now deployed, must either destroy them in place or band together with other nuclear republics in a program that would insure a single, unified command and control of such weapons.
 
Sending U.S. Experts
 To help in this regard the Administration will not only draw on the $400 million appropriated by Congress to help the republics destroy their nuclear weapons, but will also "send a team of experts to brief republic leaders" on how to establish "strict export control policies and to put in place strict internal mechanisms" to insure that weapons are not sent abroad or that "the talents of Soviet scientists and engineers are not diverted to dangerous military programs elsewhere in the world."
In the area of institution building, Mr. Baker argued that "unless republic governments respond by complementing their independence with democracy and the equal treatment of persons belonging to minorities, they will soon find themselves suffering the very same crises of legitimacy, cohesion and effectiveness that has caused the centrifugal devolution of power."
To prod the republican leaders to move down a democratic path, Mr. Baker said the United States would begin discussing with fellow members of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe ways to let newly independent republics join the organization, if they carry out the basic human rights principles of the Helsinki Final Act.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Soviet Response
 MOSCOW, Dec. 12 (AP) -- A Soviet spokesman welcomed Washington's proposal today for an international conference next month on coordinating humanitarian aid to the Soviet Union, but urged the West to move quickly.
The Soviets have urgently requested help for their country, which faces severe shortages of food, heating fuel and basic consumer goods.
The Foreign Ministry spokesman, Vitaly Churkin, said Mr. Bush's plan was "very positive." But he added, "We have seen in the past many rounds of discussion, and I would not want another conference to slow down any efforts which might be forthcoming in terms of humanitarian to our country, because it is something which is indeed very necessary."
Mr. Churkin stressed that he was expressing his own opinion rather than an official reaction to Mr. Bush's plan.

HEADLINE: For Fortunate Few, Tribal Casino Promises Jobs

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LEDYARD, Conn.

 BODY:
The shell of the first casino in New England is rising from the rock-strewn earth at the edge of the Mashantucket Pequot reservation here. Already one can see where the poker room, the blackjack tables and what management calls "three different restaurant experiences" will be when the yet-unnamed casino opens for business in February.
These days Joe Bonmer, a bespectacled Atlantic City veteran, teaches the fine points of the game of craps in a community-college gymnasium in nearby Norwich to a crowd of wide-eyed students. 
"What's he gonna do?" Mr. Bonmer asked in his best dealer's drawl as his audience stared at the numbers and boxes on the game table sprinkled with plastic gambling chips. "Your odds are off. Coming out, ma'am. Sir? Something's gotta give here."
 
Little Contact With Casinos
 His words rang true in more ways than one for the students, all of whom had signed up for a free course in how to run casino games like craps, blackjack and poker. Although many of the students had little or no contact with casinos or the Mashantucket Pequots before the 250-member tribe announced plans to open a casino, they rushed forward when advertisements for the course said dealers could make as much as $30,000 a year in wages and tips.
Most of the 650 people chosen to enroll in the course (more than 2,000 had applied) said they had lost their jobs in the last few months. Putting aside concerns about the possible negative aspects of standing between people and their money, they signed on for casino training because they saw no better prospects.
There are certainly drawbacks. The students are not guaranteed jobs; first they have to pass an audition in front of casino management. Dealers will be paid $3.75 an hour, meaning they would have to rely on tips for much of their livelihood. In an area where people are not well versed in casino etiquette, it is unclear whether tips will roll in at a high enough rate. And then there are the uniforms, Indian-style blouses trimmed with beads for men and skimpy pseudosuede tunics for cocktail waitresses.
 
Laid Off After 20 Years
 Still, the course has drawn people like Gary Workman of Norwich, who was laid off by UNC Naval Products after 20 years at the company. About 1,000 people in his research division were let go, he said, and several signed up for casino school.
"There are four of us in craps and six or seven who just started learning blackjack and poker," he said. "Everybody was a little bit hesitant to come here, because you depend a lot on tips. But it's going to be the only game in town."
At another craps table was Pam Cruh of nearby Mystic. Laid off in June as a program supervisor in the State Department of Mental Retardation, she was busy practicing her new skill: stacking and dividing piles of chips. "I never thought I'd be laid off," she said. "That's why I went to work for the state, for the security. And look what happens."
There is no doubt in most people's minds that legalized gambling, arriving amid a deep economic decline, will alter this part of Connecticut, which is still largely rural and has long depended on industries like military contracting that show little likelihood of returning to their former strength.
 
'A Stepping Stone'
 Despite some fears that gambling might worsen traffic and lead to an increase in crime, many people welcome the venture. "Things are drying up in this area," said Norman Barrett, a cable-television contractor who is not officially unemployed but notes that there is so little work now that he may as well be. "This is 10 miles from my house, and it might be a stepping stone to the restaurant part of it or the motel part of it."
Under an agreement between the state and the tribe, state agencies will regulate the casino. All profits will remain with the tribe, after it reimburses the state for the money spent on regulation, said Avice Meehan, a spokeswoman for Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.
The Mashantucket Pequots, who have run a high-stakes bingo parlor on the site for years, won the right to open their casino last year after a long legal battle that was finally decided by the United States Supreme Court. Lawyers for the tribe argued that because Connecticut allowed nonprofit groups to run fund-raising "Las Vegas nights," the state could not block the Indians from opening a casino on their reservation. The legislature approved the casino in a vote requested by Mr. Weicker this year.
 
A Different Influence
 The 45,000-square-foot casino is expected to help support services like health care and job training. It will also include features quite apart from the usual Atlantic City experience -- an exhibition hall for Indian artifacts and, eventually, a museum of the Indian experience.
The Indians' involvement has affected the design in other ways. The casino president and chief executive, Alfred J. Luciani, whose last two jobs were with the Golden Nugget and Resorts casino hotels in Atlantic City, said the tribe was "very sensitive about its image" and had early on rejected the "glitz and bordello red" that characterize many casinos.
A gray fox beneath a barren oak tree, the symbol of the Mashantucket Pequots, who are known as the fox people, dominates the facade.
Until the casino is given a name, marketing it will be inhibited, Mr. Luciani said. But perhaps not as much as it would be if the tribe's name were used. "The word Mashantucket has been butchered in so many ways since I've been here," he said. "It's certainly not a marketable name." People seem to have difficulty remembering the name or pronouncing mash-an-TUCK-ette.
 
Quarters vs. Millennium
 Mr. Luciani and the team he brought with him from New Jersey are also trying to adjust to the way their new partners think about business. "I think in terms of quarterly profits and annual results, and they really think in terms of the millennium," he said. "There's something more to this than just a blackjack game. Every tree on the construction site is personally tagged by a member of the tribe. We have to get permission before we do anything."
About 40 members of the tribe will work at the casino, filling some of the 2,300 jobs that the casino is expected to generate.
"We just can't make people Pequots," a spokeswoman for the tribe, Terry D. Bell, said. "We're a small tribe and we will always depend on outside people working for us."
That means opportunity for people like Holly Greene of Groton. She was laid off in October as a financial analyst at Electric Boat, the submarine builder, which cut 700 jobs.
"I thought it would be fun," Miss Green said, plopping piles of chips across the felt-covered table. "I told my mother I was going to craps school. And she said, 'Oh, crafts school? What are you making?' "

HEADLINE: Data Show Poor Start For Sales

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Reflecting a desultory start to the holiday shopping season, retail sales rose three-tenths of 1 percent in November, to $153.1 billion, the Commerce Department reported today.
Such transactions cover a wide variety of outlets from department stores to fast-food restaurants and account for half of all consumer spending and a third of all economic activity 
 While the percentage gain was a bit more than most analysts expected, this was partly attributed to a downward revision for October, for which sales are now put at $152.7 billion, or $200 million less than initially reported a month ago.
"The November retail sales figures confirm that the holiday shopping season was slow getting out of the blocks," said John M. Albertine, a Washington economics consultant. "Even a late buying surge won't be enough to make it a good Christmas for many retailers. The big discounters, like Wal-Mart and K Mart, will still do well, but the upscale department stores are likely to have a blue Christmas."
 
Tame Inflation Report
 A separate report today by the Labor Department showed that prices received by American producers of finished goods rose a modest two-tenths of 1 percent last month, with about half of this the result of jumps in tobacco and car prices that appear unsustainable in the current economic climate. [Page D2.]
Analysts said the tame inflation news improved the chances of another prompt move by the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates in hopes of reviving an economy that nobody believes is growing much and that many believe is heading into a second contraction. Just last Friday the Federal Reserve nudged a key short-term rate lower in response to a larger-than-expected drop in corporate payrolls in November.
The bad news about the inflation results, said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, "is that it is a reflection of the lousy economy."
Most economists believe the recession that began in July 1990 ended during the spring -- recessions technically end when the upturn starts and not when the lost ground is recovered -- but the modest recovery that followed has all but disappeared.
Today's report came just before a crucial, long-scheduled Federal Reserve policy meeting next Tuesday and amid a flurry of tax-cut and other ideas to revive growth that will be considered by Congress early next year. President Bush, acknowledging the need for action, had planned to disclose his proposal in the State of the Union Message Jan. 28 but Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said this week that some elements could be presented earlier.
A second Labor Department report showed that first-time claims for state unemployment insurance dropped a hefty 61,000 in the week ended Nov. 30, to 414,000, but analysts largely dismissed this as yet another aberration in this highly erratic series. This claims period included Thanksgiving, when unemployment offices were closed.
The retail figures showed that sales of clothes, fuel and other nondurables climbed four-tenths of 1 percent in November after falling three-tenths of 1 percent in October. Turnover rose 1.9 percent at apparel and accessory stores, 1.1 percent at gasoline stations, five-tenths of 1 percent at restaurants and bars and three-tenths of 1 percent in general merchandise stores. Food stores and drug and proprietary stores, however, posted declines of three-tenths of 1 percent.
Durable goods were unchanged over all, with a six-tenths of 1 percent advance for automotive dealers and a one-tenth of 1 percent rise for furniture, home furnishings and equipment offset by a 2.2 percent drop for dealers in building materials, hardware, garden supplies and mobile homes.
While some analysts found some solace in relatively brisk sales for such deferrable purchases as apparel and furniture, others stressed the heavy promotion and price-cutting many stores found necessary to entice customers.
"A lot of what is being moved is a little or no profit," said Lacy H. Hunt, chief economist in this country for the Hongkong Bank. He added that the large number of unfilled retailing jobs this season was "particularly troubling" because temporary workers often spend much of their earnings on gifts.
October's sales, though lower than first reported, are now calculated to have been unchanged instead of edging down one-tenth of 1 percent. This is because September's figures were also revised to show $152.7 billion of sales now, up three-tenths of 1 percent instead of six-tenths of 1 percent as previously reported.
Excluding the automotive sector, November's retail sales gain was two-tenths of 1 percent, the first increase since July.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Maxwell Weekly Ceases Publication

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
The European, the 19-month-old pan-European newspaper, closed its offices today and laid off its 145 employees -- a casualty of the collapse of the Maxwell publishing empire.
Although there appear to be some possible buyers for The European, unless a deal is struck quickly the issue that comes out on Friday will be the last. 
 The apparent end of the weekly that Robert Maxwell promoted as "Europe's first national newspaper" came only a day after European Community leaders agreed to start on the road to greater economic and political union.
 
Waiting for a New Era
 "The paper's archetypal target audience was the European traveling business executive who wanted to know what was going on in German politics as much as he wanted to know what was going on in French sports," said David W. Byles, the London-based media director of the J. Walter Thompson ad agency.
But he noted that the era of pan-European products and marketing, while on the way, was still not here, and that the paper was struggling to find the right editorial mix.
"It was a great idea but it was not a storming success in terms of advertising revenues," Mr. Byles said. "It may have been a bit ahead of its time."
After the closing, about 60 to 70 employees of The European marched across the street to the Mirror building to demand that Mirror Group Newspapers P.L.C. give them jobs. Many employees of The European came from the Mirror Group, which Mr. Maxwell controlled, and are still covered by Mirror Group union contracts. So they contend that they are entitled to jobs with the group.
 
Losses Versus Vision
 Editors of The European argue that since the paper no longer has to cater to Robert Maxwell's demands, its costs could be slashed and it could be made profitable in a year or so.
But court-appointed administrators for the bankrupt holding companies at the heart of the Maxwell empire have been more concerned with the English-language paper's losses than the correctness of its vision. One administrator, Martin Fishman, said the prospect of heavy losses led him to close the three-section color newspaper, which has a circulation of about 250,000. More than 100,000 copies are sold in Britain, about 130,000 in the rest of Europe and the remainder in the United States.
Charles Garside, deputy editor of The European, said the paper was losing nearly 200,000 a week, or more than $360,000, at the time of Robert Maxwell's death on Nov. 5.
Mr. Maxwell invested an estimated $108 million to $145 million in The European.
With The European's closure, many employees of The Daily News in New York may be happy that their money-losing paper has sought protection from creditors -- and the British administrators -- in United States Bankruptcy Court.
 
Owner of the Newspapers
 The Daily News and The European share the same parent, Robert Maxwell Group P.L.C. That private company and another, Headington Investments Ltd., are the main holding companies for the empire. Both filed for bankruptcy a week ago, leading to The Daily News's action.
The filings came just days after Coopers & Lybrand Deloitte, auditors of the Maxwell empire, discovered that Mr. Maxwell had taken more than $1 billion from employee pension funds and his two flagship public companies, the Mirror Group and the Maxwell Communication Corporation. He is believed to have made these transfers in a desperate bid to prop up his private companies. Some money is believed to have gone to The European and The Daily News.
"The real person who should be taking the blame" for the paper's closure "is lying under the ground at the Mount of Olives, " said John Bryant, editor of The European, referring to Mr. Maxwell, who is buried in Israel.
"I told my staff that it is awful and that people will be shocked, but there is no point in bitterness and despair," Mr. Bryant was quoted as saying today by The Evening Standard.
 
Clinging to Hope
 The European's staff, which includes about 70 journalists, is clinging to the hope that someone will buy the paper within a few days so it will not have to skip an issue. The employees fear that if the paper does not come out next week, reader and advertiser loyalty will be severely damaged and the paper will be unsaleable. "You can't afford to go off the street," Mr. Garside said.
Bankers Trust International P.L.C., the London-based unit of the American bank, estimated the paper might fetch as much as 27 million, or nearly $49 million. That estimate was in a report presented last month to bankers with loans to the private Maxwell companies, but it assumed there would be no fire sale of The European.
Asked whether he might get that kind of price, Mr. Fishman, a partner at Arthur Andersen & Company, laughed. Still, he said the potential buyers are British or continental Europeans and their interest seemed genuine. That, along with the offer by the staff to work without pay, were the only reasons he allowed this week's issue to be published.
 
Friends on the Payroll
 Mr. Garside said Mr. Maxwell forced the paper to put friends and acquaintances on the payroll. These people, he said, were employed as "senior advisers" to Mr. Maxwell or as contract writers, who submitted articles that were inappropriate or poorly written. He said Mr. Maxwell also insisted the paper be printed at five sites when one or two would have made sense.
In an interview published in the issue of The European that goes on sale on Friday, Ian Maxwell, who became the paper's publisher after his father's death, said he was "shocked about these revelations" about his father. But he also defended his father, saying he had created large businesses and employment for thousands. To forget the good his father did, he said, "is wrong."
"It is a tough and unforgiving world," Ian Maxwell said. "Robert Maxwell was my father and I love him."

HEADLINE: 3 Democrats Lay Out School Agendas

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Seeking the endorsement of a national teachers' union, three Democratic Presidential candidates today unveiled education plans in an effort to seize the mantle of "education president" that President Bush has been claimed but struggled to own.
The candidates -- Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, and former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts -- spoke in separate 15 minute segments at the National Education Association and used the opportunity to talk about their domestic agendas as well. The audience of about 400 included the 100-member board of directors of the National Education Association, and the organization's 50 state presidents. 
 Mr. Kerrey, who spoke first, said that unless the nation's economic ills were addressed immediately, the high school graduates of the year 2000 would inherit a debt-ridden, second-rate nation.
"The graduates of 2000 will say to us like the children of Robert Maxwell, 'Dad, we thought you were rich,' " Mr. Kerrey said.
Along with the standard Democratic promise to make Head Start, the pre-school program for low-income children, available to all those eligible, Mr. Kerrey said he would sponsor legislation to provide national health insurance and to consolidate a number of Federal departments, including folding the Department of Education into the Health and Human Services, in an effort to streamline delivery of Federal services.
"When you come to Washington and you're concerned about children you have to go to 22 different agencies," Mr. Kerrey said. "We don't even coordinate Head Start with our schools."
Mr. Clinton, who has been an advocate of educational reform in his state as well as nationally, presented his education proposals in a larger context, decrying what he called the Bush Administration's "us vs. them" approach to the nation's economic stagnation, an approach he said has pitted woman workers against men and minorities against working-class whites. He said the nation needed a national economic policy as well as national health care and national education plans.
"We better make up our mind whether we're going up or down together," Mr. Clinton said.
Mr. Clinton's education plan was the most detailed and in presenting it he was interrupted with frequent applause. Among other things, he said he would institute a national program for adult literacy, start a national apprenticeship system for young people not going to college, and scrap the current student aid program in favor of a national trust that would make college loans to students who would then pay them back in small amounts over years through Federal income tax payments.
He also promised the audience that he would involve them in education decisions if he was elected President. "If you elect me President, you'll be a full partner in the greatest education Presidency the U.S. has ever said Mr. Clinton said.
Mr. Tsongas's message was of the interaction between a country's economic health and its educational health. "Education equals economics equals education," he said, interlocking his fingers.
Mr. Tsongas told about his experiences in the Peace Corps as a teacher in Ethiopia where, he said, teachers are accorded a high status they do not enjoy in the United States. He said he wanted to change that.
 
'All Part of a Team'
 He also echoed the theme that the fortunes of all citizens of the country were tied to one another.
"We're all part of a team and we are all linked together," Mr. Tsongas said. Mr. Tsongas also proposed a student loan program that would be paid back through the Federal income tax system, with those who make more money paying back more.
An endorsement by the National Education Association, the nation's largest teacher's union with more than two million members, would mean that a candidate could count on campaign support from the group's 50 state affiliates. The association endorsed the Democratic Presidential candidates, Michael S. Dukakis, in 1988, and Jimmy Carter, in both his races. The association will announce its endorsement after April 30.
"We're looking for the best Democratic candidate to beat the incumbent President," said Keith Geiger, president of the N.E.A.
Mr. Geiger is a member of a Bush Administration's education advisory panel, but the N.E.A. is opposed to Mr. Bush's education package, "America 2000," because of its emphasis on school choice. The Bush Administration's version of school choice would allow parents to use public funds to send children to any school, public, private or parochial.
All three of the Democratic candidates at today's forum oppose any school choice plan that would include private and parochial schools.

HEADLINE: In Perpetual Candidacy, Duke Raises the Stakes

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Dec. 9

 BODY:
Like a traveling road show that folds its tent in one town and opens it in the next, the David Duke campaign is back, this time as an aside to Presidential politics.
The question is whether Mr. Duke, whose disaffected blue-collar base is made up more of traditional Democrats than Republicans, can make much of an impact in primaries where the constituency and the rules may work against him. 
 Mr. Duke, who announced last week that he would challenge President Bush in next year's Republican primaries, is concentrating on the South, on states in which Democrats can vote in Republican primaries and on states in which candidates can pick up a share of delegates without finishing first in the primary. He has identified about 20 states as potential places to campaign.
But with party rules that make it difficult for also-rans to pick up stray delegates and with overwhelming hostility from the Republican Party leadership, Mr. Duke is in the odd position of needing support from Democratic voters to do well in Republican primaries. Experts say his biggest impact could come if he mounted a third-party candidacy in the general election in November in the manner of the George Wallace campaigns of 1968 and 1972.
 
'A Media Creation'
 To some critics, particularly Republicans seeking to disown him, Mr. Duke, a Louisiana State Representative who is also a former Ku Klux Klan leader and Nazi sympathizer, remains little more than an exotic bloom that lives only in the exaggerated glow of the media.
"He's nothing but a media creation," said David Shafer, executive director of the Georgia Republican Party. "There is no other state representative in the country who could run twice for office, be beaten by increasingly larger margins and then be taken seriously by the media as a candidate for President. It's totally ridiculous. It boggles me that he's taken seriously at all."
But after Mr. Duke won more than half of the white vote in Louisiana in racially divisive campaigns for senator last year and governor last month, others see the real possibility that he could play a political role wildly disproportionate to his modest hopes of gaining many delegates.
"The real question is whether he will run as an independent," said Larry Sabato, a professor of government at the University of Virginia, "because that's where he could do real damage, not just to Bush but also to the public discourse on race.
"He's a terribly divisive individual, I think more than the equivalent of George Wallace in 1968. Wallace certainly helped to tear the social fabric, and I fear Duke will do the same and perhaps more so."
 
Potential for a Reprise
 Few doubt that the slumping economy and the frustrations of disaffected whites, particularly in the South, provide the potential for a reprise of Mr. Wallace's angry outsider's campaigns.
"Southern turnout peaked in 1968, and it's been down ever since," said Merle Black, a professor of politics and government at Emory University. "And a large part of that is because Wallace got out of the business. Those people have never had a champion since, and Duke is the closest incarnation of that."
The trouble for Mr. Duke is that those voters are not necessarily going to vote in Republican primaries, which usually attract upscale Republican regulars rather than members of his blue-collar base.
"When you look at his supporters, the Republican primaries are his worst possible constituency," Mr. Black said.
In Florida, where primary voting is limited to registered Republicans and where party leaders decide who is on the ballot, Mr. Duke may not even get on the ballot or choose to run. In other important states, like Texas, the other top prize in the 12 states scheduled to take part in the Super Tuesday primary on March 10, most analysts expect him to struggle to break out of single digits.
 
Buchanan Complication
 His troubles will be compounded, too, by the Presidential candidacy of Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative columnist who is expected to split the anti-Bush protest vote.
"Zip, zero, nada, zilch," said Carl Rove, a Republican consultant in Austin who was vice president of the 1988 George Bush campaign in Texas. "There just aren't enough unreconstructed Nazi sympathizers and Ku Klux Klansmen in the Republican Party for him to have a measurable impact on the primary. He will have zero delegates in Texas."
Mr. Duke is likely to focus on open primary states, those where all voters can vote in either the Democratic or Republican primary, and states in which runners-up can get a share of delegates rather than those where the first-place finisher gets all the delegates.
Early primaries where he has the potential to get a healthy slice of the vote include Georgia and Mississippi, which have open primaries. Tennessee, with an open primary and no winner-take-all system, could be his best bet for picking up both votes and delegates to the Republican National Convention in Houston.
Mr. Duke is also likely to run in states outside the South like New York, California, Maryland and Michigan. But some states are contemplating changing the threshold for acquiring delegates as a way to thwart him. Michigan's State Republican Committee voted last weekend to increase the threshold for winning delegates to 33 percent from 5 percent.
Skeptics, like Mr. Rove of Texas, say Mr. Duke runs the risk of doing so poorly in the primaries that he will be discredited as a serious threat.
 
'Nothing But a Fraud'
 "Getting into these primaries is going to just marginalize this guy," Mr. Rove said. "This whole thing is nothing but a fraud, an attempt to keep raising campaign money."
Those who have followed Mr. Duke's political career in Louisiana are less quick to discount him.
"I think what's driving it are some very fundamental discontents and anxieties," said Lawrence Powell, a history professor at Tulane University. "I don't know if he could do as well as Wallace, but there's a lot of deep cynicism that he's tapping into."

HEADLINE: New Capital Rules Proposed For Investments of Insurers

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG

 BODY:
Top state insurance regulators released a rough draft of a proposal yesterday that would require insurers that take above-average risks to have capital, or cushion against loss, commensurate with those risks.
The proposal, which is similar to a regulation already in place for banks, could benefit policyholders who are concerned about their insurers' financial positions. 
 Specifically, once insurers face a risk-adjusted capital requirement, any insurer that fell short of the necessary capital would be highlighted.
"What that would do is give regulators a chance to better zero in on companies in trouble," explained Gloria Vogel, an analyst who follows insurance stocks for Shearson Lehman Brothers in New York.
 
Trial Period Ahead
 The proposal, which will now be tried out in a handful of states, was made by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, a group of state insurance regulators that ended its regular winter meeting yesterday in Houston.
If all goes according to the association's plan, the test phase will last roughly from next March to December 1992. There will then be an additional comment period before a final version of the capital requirement goes into effect, presumably for financial statements covering 1994.
Regardless of the ultimate details, the intention is to tie the amount of capital an insurer must keep on hand to the riskiness of its business. There is a broad consensus in the industry that the current system, under which an insurer's required capital is fixed by state law, makes little sense given the large variety of policies being written today and insurers' different approaches to investing.
Under the capital requirement to be tested, state insurance regulators would measure four different risks at each insurer: the risk from declines in asset values, risks of unexpectedly high claims, interest-rate risk and business risks, such as from lawsuits.
Tallying up these risks would then permit state insurance regulators to set an appropriate level of capital for each insurer. So, for instance, an insurer writing health insurance, for which claims often run unexpectedly high, would need more capital than a company selling auto policies, for which claims are very predictable.
The N.A.I.C. is using the term "threshold capital" to describe how much capital each insurer would need. Insurers that failed to maintain their capital at the threshold would be subject to regulatory action.
 
Incentive of Regulators>
 Faced with growing pressure from consumers incensed that regulators did not move more quickly to correct problems at three giant life insurers that failed this year -- Executive Life, Mutual Benefit Life and First Capital Life -- regulators are eager to appear to be on top of the problem, particularly in states where insurance commissioners are elected.
Executive Life had a sizable portfolio of high-risk junk bonds, and many other life insurers have invested heavily in commercial real estate, which could result in large losses in the current real estate recession.

Disney Picks California Theme Park Site

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 12

 BODY:
The Walt Disney Company said today that it had chosen a site adjacent to Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif., for its next theme park, ending consideration of a competing site in Long Beach, Calif.
Disney executives stopped short of guaranteeing that the project would be built. They said the company must still deal with a number of environmental, regulatory and economic issues related to building in an increasingly congested urban area. 
 The company built Disneyland in Anaheim 36 years ago, when Orange County, south of Los Angeles, was largely strawberry fields and orange groves. The area is now heavily developed and choked with traffic.
Today Disney executives seemed to be dangling the prospect of a huge influx of jobs and tax dollars into Southern California's battered economy if state and local governments would cooperate on plans for the $3 billion, 470-acre Anaheim project.
The project, called the Disneyland Resort, would open at the end of the decade and would include a new theme park known as Westcot Center, as well as hotels, a huge lake and a shopping mall.
If completed, Disney said, the new project would create nearly 28,000 new jobs, and would generate $55 million a year in additional taxes and fees for the city of Anaheim and Orange County, and $70 million a year in new tax revenue for the state.
"We've never built a mega-project like this in an existing urban environment," said Peter Rummell, president of Disney Development, the subsidiary in charge of the project. "The economic feasibility of the project still has to be proven."
Disney is now putting the final touches on Euro Disneyland, outside Paris, and it also operates Disney World in Florida. The company licenses its name to Tokyo Disneyland in Japan.
The centerpiece of the new project is the Westcot Center, a complex inspired by the highly sucessful Epcot Center at Disney World. it would contain themed pavilions about foreign countries, the human body and other subjects. The project would also include an elaborate system of parking lots and people movers to cope with the traffic it would create.
Disney has long been interested in a second theme park in Southern California. For the last several years, it has been openly considering both Long Beach and Anaheim. Some analysts said the company had been playing the two cities off against each other to get the best possible deal for itself and to minimize regualatory objections.
In ruling out Long Beach today, the company said that the time and expense of winning the necessary approvals for that site made the project unfeasible. The Long Beach project would have been built partly on landfill along the city's harbor, and that plan raised questions among state and regional agencies about its effect on the harbor and the Pacific Ocean.
 
Delighted and Excited
 Officials in Anaheim said they were optimistic the project would be built. "The City of Anaheim is delighted, excited and enthusiastic about the decision to build a second attraction here," Anaheim's City Manager, Jim Ruth, told The Associated Press. "We think we have arrived at a plan that is environmentally and economically sound."
Still, Disney must make a final decision about the Anaheim project at a time when its theme parks are suffering from the economic downturn and a decline in tourism.

HEADLINE: Changes Begun in Water Works Projects, Dinkins Says

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
Acknowledging that the New York City Department of Environmental Protection was remiss in not letting $600 million in contracts for water mains and sewers last year, Mayor David N. Dinkins said yesterday that the city had begun making changes to insure that the agency's rebuilding projects were not delayed.
While Mr. Dinkins said he was disappointed, he declined to criticize Albert F. Appleton, the Environmental Protection Commissioner. 
 But the Mayor has assigned Rudolph J. Rinaldi, the city's Building Commissioner, to personally oversee the environmental department's rebuilding program, which Mr. Appleton said yesterday he welcomed.
The Mayor maintained that his administration had identified the problems several months ago and that steps had been taken to resolve them. The problems, which recently prompted a sharply worded letter to Mr. Appleton from First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel, had not been made public before they were reported yesterday in The New York Times.
 
Leaky Pipes Unrepaired
 Mr. Appleton and other administration officials said environmental department capital spending was delayed last year because the department moved, its contracting officials did not understand changes in the city procurement procedures, and other city agencies were delayed in performing support services for bids.
The department's shortfall in capital spending has meant that dozens of deteriorating water and sewer pipes have gone unrepaired. It has cost the city 8,000 jobs that would have resulted from the constrution, city officials and local economists say.
Mr. Appleton said in an interview yesterday that the agency is moving quickly to increase its capital spending and that in the last three months it has let $219 million in contracts. He said he is optimistic that the department will meet its $1.51 billion spending target for the 1992 fiscal year.
But Mr. Appleton said the agency's capital budget will probably drop to about $1.1 billion because of design delays at the Newtown Creek sewage treatment plant, cuts in the Transportation Department's street rebuilding program and lower construction costs.
The City Comptroller, Elizabeth Holtzman, issued a report yesterday that criticized the city's method of setting water and sewer fees, which have risen sharply in recent years.
Ms. Holtzman said that the department's capital and operating budgets are proposed by the administration and approved by the City Council, but that an independent body, the Water Board, sets water and sewer rates at levels needed to pay for the spending. The process has resulted in millions of dollars in waste and ovespending, she said.

It's Pay-for-Play: When Cost Equals Privilege

BYLINE: By ANDREW H. MALCOLM

DATELINE: RIDGEFIELD, Conn.

 BODY:
WHEN the girls' basketball team warms up here tomorrow noon against the dread Danbury Hatters, the Ridgefield Tigers will have one invisible distinction: they'll be the only players in the gym who have paid for the privilege of representing their school in athletic competition.
The infiltration of high school sports by user fees is spreading, especially in the Northeast. To compete against another school, every Ridgefield athlete must pay $75 a sport, considerably more than the spectators pay. 
 The principal, Joseph Ellis, doesn't like it. "The question is," he said, "should public school students have to pay to participate in a public school activity? From my point of view, no."
The superintendent, Jerry Marcus, doesn't like it. "I thought I was making progress to kill the fees," he said. "But given today's budget problems, I don't see that happening."
Even the Ridgefield Board of Education, which approved the policy in 1989, doesn't like it. "It's a real simple question of economics," said Joseph Sweeney, a board member. "If we have insufficient money for a full athletic program, do we cut some sports and field teams with insufficient coaches? Or do we ask those who play to help pay?"
Given the stringent realities of public budgets, even in this affluent Fairfield County community, and the shrinking constituencies of secondary-school families, this has become a smoldering philosophical financial debate that is creeping through the locker rooms and board rooms of more public school systems across the country.
At the moment, the pay-for-play team is winning. "I've never had so many calls from administrators," said Helen Upton, assistant director of the National Federation of High School Associations. "They're having to justify financially every program, athletic and otherwise."
A year ago, 10 of the 178 schools in Connecticut's Interscholastic Athletic Association had pay-for-play. Now, 18 do. "You don't pay extra for Russian, band or chorus," said Mike Savage, the association's executive director. "Why should public school students be required to pay for something so valuable in teaching values -- teamwork, leadership, time management, sportsmanship?"
Mr. Marcus, in fact, fears public schools may impose fees for any so-called extracurricular activity. "If they pay to play in a game," he said, "why not to act in a play? Or sing? Or work on the yearbook?"
"Let me tell you," warns Mr. Ellis, the principal, "if we charged to work on the yearbook, no one would do it."
This year Ridgefield High's athletic budget for 23 boys' teams and 19 girls' teams is $226,624, including $59,250 paid by 800 athletes (six students eligible for free lunches had the fee waived).
There are, however, sticky problems beyond bookkeeping and cajoling forgetful students to remind procrastinating parents their check is due before the kickoff. It seems that parents who must pay for their child to join a team easily come to believe their child must also play for that team. And as paying parents, they're not hesitant to approach the coach with not-always-friendly suggestions.
"Pay-for-play," said John Fontana, head of Connecticut's High School Coaches Association and first vice president of the National Association, "says, 'We're out here to teach you values, but it'll cost ya.' So it's not how you play, it's who gets to play."
No accident then that the Ridgefield principal's annual Dear Parent letter includes the following paragraph in all capital letters and boldface:
"Payment Of The Fee Does Not Guarantee Any Minimum Of Playing Time Or Any Implied Privileges Beyond Membership."
Some media-savvy boards suggest slashing sports just to get the attention of voters, who will scream for a football squad in a pouring rain but yawn in a comfortable den over the loss of two Spanish teachers. "Athletics is a handy lightning rod," Ms. Upton said. "So we urge administrators to stress sports and music as co-curricula, not extra-curricula."
She cites studies showing 9 of 10 dropouts were not in such activities.
Does any school ever relinquish pay-for-play once it tastes the extra money? "We did," said Nick Zeoli, athletic director at nearby Wilton High, where 72 percent of the 900 students play on at least one of 56 school teams.
Seven years ago Wilton imposed athletic participation fees from $25 for gymnastics to $100 for hockey. Fathers in the affluent town were ribbed unmercifully by fellow commuters about their "poor" school. Opposing athletes also commented. Parents objected to the double jeopardy of fees and taxes. Others complained their offspring did not receive the newest uniforms or equal playing time for the same fee. "We couldn't dump pay-for-play fast enough," Mr. Zeoli said. It died nine months later.
What changed the board's mind so quickly? "Anyone who complained to me," said a straight-faced Mr. Zeoli, "I gave them the board president's home phone. I said to call her only after midnight."

HEADLINE: Bush Considers Tax-Credit Plan To Aid Business

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
President Bush's top economic advisers said today for the first time that to stimulate the economy, the Administration might favor a tax credit for business investments in plants and machinery.
"The history of investment tax credits is that they are somewhat effective, and maybe for that reason we ought to do it at this time," Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady told the Senate Finance Committee. 
 This kind of tax break, theoretically a boon to manufacturing, has considerable support in Congress and would stand a good chance of enactment if the Administration pushed for it.
The advisers offered no details of what they were considering but suggested that they might favor a credit only on investments above and beyond what a business might otherwise have planned.
 
Specifics Being Prepared
 The testimony from Mr. Brady, Richard G. Darman, the budget director, and Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, was their second in a week, and in most respects, what they told the Finance Committee added little to what they said to the House Ways and Means Committee on Dec. 5.
The Administration, they said, was preparing proposals to improve the economy in the short run and the long run, and these will be in the President's State of the Union Message and budget early next year. No final decisions have been made yet, they said.
But the officials today disclosed some of their thinking about specific tax issues that they had not discussed in last week's testimony. In addition to showing some enthusiasm about an investment tax credit, they opposed outright both the reintroduction of tax breaks for real estate investments and a special tax on people with incomes greater than $1 million.
They said that at Mr. Bush's instructions, they were examining ways to give a tax cut to middle-income families but were not committed to such a step. They also raised the prospect of considering tax legislation next year in two rounds, one right off the bat when Congress returns in January to give the economy a jolt and the other later in the year to deal with longer- range economic problems.
The Finance Committee is one of the most conservative committees in Congress, and many of the Democrats, including the chairman, Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, and David L. Boren of Oklahoma, have views on taxes and economic policy that are quite similar to the Bush Administration's. Mr. Bentsen, for instance, is sponsoring a new tax break for individual retirement accounts for upper-income taxpayers, and Mr. Boren is a strong supporter of a capital gains tax cut.
Still, politics was the order of the day. Over and over, the Democrats hammered Mr. Bush's advisers on the question of middle-class tax relief. The Democrats buttressed their position with new statistics showing how well the richest Americans had done in the 1980's, while the after-tax income of the poor and middle class rose little if at all.
The Administration officials refused to concede that the gap between the rich and the poor had increased in the Reagan-Bush years, something that almost all academics accept regardless of their politics.
 
Elusive Data on the Rich
 Mr. Brady argued that the wealthy were paying a higher percentage of the nation's total tax burden than they used to, a statistic that is accurate because the wealthy have an even higher share of the total income than they did before 1981. And at one point the Treasury Secretary held up a color graphic illustrating that poor people take more out of the economy in benefits than they pay in taxes, while rich people pay more in taxes than they receive in benefits.
Mr. Brady and his colleagues insisted that they felt deeply about the plight of middle-class voters. "If you ask the question, do we want to do more for middle-income Americans, the answer is unequivocally yes," Mr. Darman said.
As for the Administration's diehard support for a capital gains tax cut, Mr. Brady said, "The furthest thing in any of our minds is to create a windfall for people in the highest brackets."
 
Continuing Political Fight
 The back-and-forth over what the Democrats call fairness was, of course, simply another round in the political fight that has occupied the Democratic Congress and the Republican White House for most of the Bush Presidency and that is likely to intensify next year.
But for all the political talk, the biggest news came from a brief discussion of the notion of an investment tax credit.
Such a tax credit was first enacted under President John F. Kennedy in 1961 and except for a few months in the middle 1960's and two years during the Nixon Administration, it was on the books until it was abolished by the Tax Reform Act of 1986.
An investment tax credit would permit businesses to subtract directly from their tax bills a percentage of the money they invest in plants and machinery. Supporters maintain that it would encourage businesses to expand and generate new jobs and a stronger economy. Opponents say it would reward businesses for investments they would make anyway, would help capital-intensive industries more than those that depend largely on labor and would benefit established companies more than start-up businesses.
 
Support in History
 At today's hearing, Mr. Boskin said investment tax credits had been "effective, at least partially" in the past in improving the economy. He said the best bet might be a credit on investments above a certain level to prevent companies from getting a tax break on money they would have spent regardless. Senator Bentsen said he agreed with that view.
The main problem with an investment tax credit is the same as the problem with most other tax breaks: it would produce less revenue and, under the budget law, would require that an offsetting amount be raised elsewhere. The President and Congress might not be able to agree on such an offset.
The idea of dealing with tax policy next year in two rounds, one quickly and the other after more debate and deliberation, seemed to be an approach worked out by Mr. Darman and Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader.
Senator Bentsen said afterward that he opposed such a plan, lessening the prospect that it might be acted on.

Long-Term Rates Fall on Reports

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Long-term interest rates moved lower yesterday, helped by an inflation report that was better than expected, as well as by declines in gold and commodity prices, two inflation indicators that are monitored closely by private analysts, as well as by Government officials.
In addition, bond prices benefited from a Commerce Department report that showed the Christmas buying season got off to a slow start in November, as well as from comments by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who once again said he was favorably disposed to issuing more short-term Government securities to help push down long-term bond yields. 
 The two-tenths of a percent rise in the November Producer Price Index was about half of what most economists had anticipated, and it reaffirmed the notion that inflation remained low.
 
Other Sales Figures
 But at the same time, the three-tenths of a percent rise in November retail sales was above expectations. And the two-tenths of a percent rise in sales excluding automobiles was the first increase since July.
At first blush, the numbers seemed to suggest that consumer activity had begun to pick up. But analysts said the increase was tainted because of downward revisions in sales figures for September and October.
"The revisions showed that consumers are still struggling," said David H. Resler, chief economist at Nomura Securities International. "Some people interpreted the November figures as saying that Christmas won't be horrible. But in the aggregate, the data don't support that view."
Besides these developments, some traders said an auction of $12.3 billion in new one-year Treasury bills helped to raise the prices of longer-term, higher-yielding securities, including bonds.
 
New Bills at 4.20%
 At the auction, the new bills were sold at an average discount rate of 4.20 percent, well down from the average rate of 4.72 percent at last month's one-year bill sale.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 102 27/32 late yesterday, up by 17/ 32, to yield 7.75 percent, compared with 7.80 percent late on Wednesday.
Bond yields are now about as low as they have been all year, and analysts said additional evidence of economic weakness, as well as more good news on inflation, would be needed before long-term rates could move much lower.
In the secondary market for Treasury bills, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered at 102 9/32 in late trading, up by 6/32, to yield 7.17 percent. But the prices of the 5.50 percent two-year notes dipped by 1/32, to 100 7/8, to yield 5.02 percent.
Short-term Treasury bill rates moved slightly higher.
By late in the day, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 4.14 percent, up 2 basis points, or two one-hundredths of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 4.15 percent.
Activity in the corporate bond market was highlighted by an anticipated offering of $1 billion in high-yield securities for Owens-Illinois Inc.
The 11 percent senior debentures, which mature on Dec. 1, 2003, were priced at $100, or par. The securities are noncallable for eight years.
Merrill Lynch & Company was the lead manager for the underwriting. The securities are rated Ba-3 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and BB by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In conjunction with Wednesday's equity offering, proceeds from the bond sale will be used to retire some $1.8 billion in high-yield securities issued when Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company bought Owens-Illinois in a 1987 leveraged buyout.
Merrill Lynch officials said late yesterday that all of the new securities had been sold.
In other developments, A.T.& T., which last week sold more than $670 million in 40-year bonds, its first public debt offering since 1986, said yesterday that it intended to call some $850 million worth of debt issued in 1970. The company said it would date the formal call notices on Dec. 13, for formal redemption on Jan. 13.
 
Money Supply Up
 The Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply rose during the week ended Dec. 2.
M2, the monetary aggregate most closely followed by the Fed, rose by $3.5 billion during the period, an increase that was slightly larger than most economists had anticipated.
M2 has been posting fairly healthy increases in recent weeks, but its growth is only just above the 2.5 percent level that represents the lower end of the Fed's growth target range for the 12 months ending on Dec. 31.
"M2 growth is finally above the lower target," said Mr. Resler, the Nomura Securities economist. "That is encouraging, but it has to continue."
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of one-year Treasury bills:

Boise Cascade May Cut Dividend

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

 BODY:
Boise Cascade, the world's eighth-largest paper producer, plans to sell more assets, and could lower its dividend to reduce debt. Boise Cascade has not cut its dividend in more than 20 years. The board of directors will meet today in San Francisco. "The company's bias is to hold onto the dividend," said Vince Hannity, a company spokesman. "But that depends on business conditions, and they're getting more difficult." 
 The company, based in Boise, Idaho, is losing money this year because of problems at paper mills in International Falls, Minn., Rumford, Me., and Kenora, Ontario. Boise Cascade has also been hurt by declining paper prices that have accompanied the recession. The company has raised about $250 million from asset sales this year.

Visions of Sugarplums And Puns

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
WHAT is it about the holiday season that inspires advertising agencies to play with words so freely?
Commercials and advertisements bursting with puns and other wordplays are inundating consumers this month, for products from cameras and soft drinks to cereal and underwear. Even ads for so-called sin products, like cigarettes and liquor, are joining in. 
 Print ads by Grace & Rothschild for J & B Scotch have white letters on a bright green background that read, "ingle ells, ingle ells," followed by the explanation: "The holidays aren't the same without J & B."
For Sharp's non-alcoholic brew, ads by Frankenberry, Laughlin & Constable Inc. in Milwaukee are headlined, "Noel-cohol" -- with a pair of bottle caps instead of the umlaut.
For the Eastman Kodak Company, ads by Young & Rubicam New York show a Scrooge-type character, next to the word "Humbug," transformed by a Kodak Star 35 camera into a "Shutterbug."
Advertising executives say the wordplay is intended to tap into the spirit of the season, to add joy and cheer to pitches for products like Joy and Cheer.
"It's a lighter, joyous time of year," said Roy Grace, chairman of Grace & Rothschild in New York. "That translates into 'Let's have a little fun, let's do a pun.' "
And there are many other examples of these playful ads:
*For the National Pork Producers Council, which for years has been selling pork as "the other white meat," ads by Bozell Inc. in Chicago carry the theme "White Christmas."
*For Baileys Original Irish Cream liqueur, ads by Geer, DuBois Inc. in New York urge consumers to "Let it flow, let it flow, let it flow."
*For Kix cereal, which contrasts its plain appearance to other brands' colorful gimmickry, ads by Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising depict 38 Kix puffs arranged in the shape of a Christmas tree. The headline reads, "No decorations necessary."
*For Virginia Slims cigarettes, print ads by Leo Burnett U.S.A. in Chicago are captioned, "You've come a fa-la-la-la-la-long way, baby."
While such ads have always been popular at the holidays, executives say there are more than ever this year. The reason, they add, is a belief that humor might, in some small way, help banish the anxieties over the economy that are keeping consumers from becoming customers.
One pitfall to this form of advertising is the subjective nature of the humor: One person's grin is another's groan.
But that has not proved a problem for Sharp's, said Tom Cardella, a category manager at the Miller Brewing Company in Milwaukee, adding that consumers and retailers have responded that the humor "fits in well" with the product's seasonal appeal.
Another potential drawback is the possibility that treating the holiday season in a light-hearted fashion, especially when it comes to the religious aspects of Christmas, might prove offensive.
"There's always the question of the Christmas holiday being exploited for commercial purposes," said F. Forrester Church, minister of All Souls Unitarian Church in New York, "and that does cut radically against the grain of the Gospel."
"On the other hand," he added, "anyone who gets too excited about this is also missing the point of the Christmas season." He cited what he called "my favorite quote in theology," from the writer G. K. Chesterton: "Angels can fly because they take themselves lightly."
"And I've added, 'The Devil falls on account of his gravity.' "

GRAPHIC: Photo: The headline in a print advertisement for Sharp's non-alcoholic brew, part of a campaign created by Frankenberry, Laughlin & Constable for the Miller Brewing Company, exemplifies the punning and wordplay that seems to pervade holiday season advertising.

HEADLINE: Wells Fargo to Set Aside $700 Million for Losses

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Wells Fargo & Company, the big California bank, said today that it would set aside about $700 million for loan losses, an action that reflects the deepening weakness of California's commercial real estate market.
The San Francisco-based bank, which has an unusually large portfolio of real estate loans, said the action was expected to result in a fourth-quarter loss of more than $200 million. Wells Fargo also announced that it was halving the dividend on its common stock, to 50 cents a share, joining a growing list of banks that have reduced payments to shareholders to conserve capital. 
 Both the $700 million provision for loan losses and the size of the fourth-quarter loss were far greater than analysts had expected. The loan-loss provision reflects the results of a grueling examination of Wells Fargo's loan portfolio conducted by Federal auditors in the last few months.
Nevertheless, Wells Fargo's share price rose $3.25 today to close at $60.50. Investors seem to think that the worst is over and that the bank will be able to solve its problems. Indeed, despite the expected fourth-quarter loss of $4.20 to $4.60 a share, which translates to a net loss of $218 million to $239 million, Wells Fargo said it expected a slight profit for the full year.
"I've never been so happy after such a large loss and such a drop in the dividend," said Thomas Brown, a banking analyst with Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc. He said he thought regulators had put pressure on Wells to increase its loan-loss reserves.
 
'Environment Full of Pessimism'
 Wells would not comment on the regulators' requirements. Carl Reichardt, the chief executive of Wells Fargo, said in a statement that the bank made its move because "we're operating in a difficult environment, full of pessimism and anxiety about the economy in general and real estate in particular." The statement continued, "In this environment it is only prudent to make a significant addition to our loan loss-reserves."
After booming through the 1980's, California's economy is slumping, and commercial real estate values have dropped so far that some pessimists predict the state will become the next Texas or New England in terms of banking problems. But other analysts say the diversity of California's industries and continued population growth will keep it from sinking into more serious problems.
Donald K. Crowley, an analyst with Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. in San Francisco, said that he did not expect Wells to have any more big net losses but did think its profits would be held down for several years because of the problems in commercial real estate.
"Their exposure in commercial real estate remains sizable," he said. "It's a wound that's likely to keep bleeding, but it's not your jugular that's been cut."
 
Bank Losses in the State
 California's 485 banks had aggregate losses of $74 million in the third quarter, according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Two other big banks, the Security Pacific Corporation and First Interstate Bancorp, both based in Los Angeles, reported losses in the third quarter of the same magnitude that Wells expects in the fourth.
Wells Fargo, the state's third-largest bank, with assets of $55 billion, has long been known as one of the nation's most efficient and profitable banks.
But analysts have become worried because the bank has an unusually large proportion of its loan portfolio in two troubled areas -- real estate and leveraged buyouts. Its loans for land, construction and commercial mortgages account for roughly a quarter of its $46 billion loan portfolio, a percentage more than twice as high as that of rival BankAmerica Corporation and also significantly higher than for the other big California banks.
Wells had insisted that it could avoid problems because it made better loans than its rivals. But it, too, has suffered setbacks. In the second quarter of this year, Wells set aside $350 million for loan-loss reserves related to leveraged buyouts, reducing its profits to a meager level.
 
Actual Expected Loss
 Wells Fargo said it expected that actual loan losses in the fourth quarter would be about $200 million, up from $123 million in the third quarter. That is not as big an increase as expected, which is another reason the stock rose today, analysts said.
With only $200 million in loan charge-offs this quarter, $500 million of the $700 million loan-loss provision will be left for future losses. That reserve will grow to $1.65 billion and will cover about 80 percent of the bank's nonaccrual loans, compared with 63 percent now. That shift will bring Wells Fargo's reserves more in line with industry averages, analysts said.
Wells said it expected its nonperforming assets to grow less than 10 percent in the fourth quarter, from its third-quarter level of $2.3 billion. Nonperforming real estate loans actually grew more, but the bank sold a package of mostly nonaccruing loans during the quarter, bank officials and analysts said.
 Thomas H. Hanley, an analyst with Salomon Brothers, said Wells Fargo was thef irst major bank to emerge from an examination by Federal regulators since the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced new guidelines last month intended to relieve what is known as the credit crunch.
 Mr. Hanley said the Wells actions suggested a new strategy by Federal examiners. They will not be so quick to require banks to declare loans as nonperforming. But, he added, it appears that the regulators will insist on higher reserves for future loan losses and will urge banks to cut dividends to raise capital.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Rise 0.2%, Easing Fears on Inflation

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Prices at the producer level rose a slim two-tenths of a percent in November, the Labor Department said today, adding to evidence that the faltering economy continued to evade any inflationary pressures.
 The new data suggest the Federal Reserve could move again to cut interest rates without having to fear it would be setting the stage for higher inflation, economists said. 
 The November rise in the Producer Price Index followed a jump of seven-tenths of a percent in October and was generally in line with forecasts by economists.
 So far this year, the index, which measures prices charged by producers of finished goods, has risen at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of two-tenths of a percent.
 The "core" rate of inflation, which excludes the often-volatile food and energy prices, rose three-tenths of a percent after moving up five-tenths of a percent a month earlier.
 
 
No Warning Sign
 Economists were concerned that last month's jump might have been a warning sign that inflation was on the upswing, but additional data seemed to put that to rest.
 "Inflation is essentially the good news in the economy," said Brian Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu. "The Fed can concentrate on stimulating demand," he said, adding that another rate cut might come as soon as next week, after policy makers of the central bank meet Tuesday.
 Lower interest rates can spur businesses and consumers to borrow and give a lift to economic activity.
 Officials in the Bush Administration have been trying to frame a plan to rescue the economy, which appears to have emerged from recession but at such an anemic level that it is hardly being felt.
 The weak performance has set off warning bells at the White House as President Bush's ability to deal with the economy is increasingly being questioned by voters as the 1992 Presidential election campaign gets under way.
 Some economists think the recession may show its face again when this quarter's figures on the nation's total output are released.

HEADLINE: U.S. Growth Figures Seen As Lower

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Dec. 12

 BODY:
For the second time in a month, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has reportedly revised downward its projection for economic growth in the United States.
According to Agence France-Presse, the O.E.C.D.'s latest economic report -- which is embargoed for release until next Friday -- says that the American economy will grow by 2.2 percent in 1992. That figure is down from the forecast of a 2.5 percent American growth rate in 1992 that the Paris-based organization made just one month ago. And last month's prediction was significantly lower than the 3.1 percent growth rate for 1992 that the O.E.C.D. had projected six weeks earlier. 
 The agency also said that according to the new report, America's economic output for all of 1991 would decline by five-tenths of 1 percent, which is several tenths of a percent less than the forecast made last month.
The O.E.C.D., a 24-nation organization that promotes economic cooperation, is widely respected for its economic projections, which are based on sophisticated computer models. Nonetheless, its officials say they have repeatedly had to revise downward their forecasts for the United States because the nation's economic doldrums are proving far more stubborn than anticipated.
Senior O.E.C.D. officials say that the United States will not suffer a double-dip recesson and that the American economy should start to pick up this spring.
One bright spot for the United States is that the new report projects that the American economy will grow faster in 1993 than had been projected, according to the French news agency. The O.E.C.D., it says, predicts that American economic growth will be 3.5 percent for 1993, up from the forecast of 3 percent for 1993 that the O.E.C.D. made last month.
O.E.C.D. officials often say that the deeper a recession turns out to be, the more robust the rebound should prove to be. In addition, organization economists say that the Federal Reserve's repeated lowering of interest rates should eventually give growth a boost.
According to Agence France-Presse, the organization also said that growth in the industrial world would be a tepid 2.2 percent next year, down from the projection of 2.6 percent it made a month ago.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Strong Economic Reports Give a Lift to the Dollar

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar closed mostly higher yesterday after what currency traders saw as stronger-than-expected economic reports.
"There was good reaction to surprisingly strong numbers," said Matthew Robertson, vice president at Banque Nationale de Paris. "The biggest one was retail sales." 
 The United States currency closed at 1.5835 German marks, up from Wednesday's finish of 1.5780. The dollar also closed unchanged at 129.30 Japanese yen.
The Commerce Department reported that retail sales rose three-tenths of 1 percent in November, after remaining unchanged in October. Although the gain was not strong enough to change propects of a dismal Christmas selling season, they were better than some economists had feared.
A fall in new weekly claims for unemployment insurance also helped the dollar.
The statistics helped the dollar but analysts said they did not indicate much strength in the economy.
"Retail sales have been trending lower on a year-over-year basis for the last five months," said David Gilmore, senior analyst at MCM Currencywatch.
Separately, the Labor Department said its Producer Price Index rose a scant two-tenths of 1 percent last month after a jump of seven-tenths of 1 percent in October that had briefly raised inflation fears.
Brian Fabbri, chief economist at Midland Montagu Securities Inc., said the modest rise in wholesale prices should help convince the Federal Reserve that it could lower interest rates again without rekindling inflation.
Many traders expect the Fed to cut its benchmark discount rate soon, and Mr. Gilmore said speculation will heighten before Tuesday's meeting of the central bank's policy-making Federal Open Market Committee.
Although the prospect of a rate cut may weigh on the dollar, Charles Spence, corporate foreign exchange manager at First Interstate Bank, said political turmoil in the Soviet Union could lend some support. The dollar has often been a safe haven for investors in times of crisis.
The British pound closed at $1.8070, down slightly from $1.8080 on Wednesday.
The dollar also closed at 1.3995 Swiss francs, compared with 1.3925 francs Wednesday. It rose to 5.4095 French francs, from 5.2835 francs in the previous session.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Worrying Over Weakened Unions

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
GEORGE P. SHULTZ, who was Secretary of State in the Reagan Administration, is concerned about the possible harm to American industry and society stemming from the declining American labor movement.
Now the recession is further weakening the trade union movement, as always happens in slumps, with layoffs and employers' demands for givebacks undermining the bargaining power and organizing appeal of the unions. 
 "I go back to the old days in industrial relations," Mr. Shultz, who started his career as an economist and labor-management arbitrator, recently told the National Planning Association. "And I think of two things that have come through to me as lessons."
The first, he said, is that in "a healthy workplace, it is very important that there be some system of checks and balances." As an economist, he recognizes that the labor market itself produces checks and balances, as workers compete for jobs and management competes for labor.
But in a society in which individual strength depends on organizational connections, he thought there was still need for the checks and balances that derive from "what used to be called the system of industrial jurisprudence." This covered the entire process of dispute settlement through collective bargaining, grievance procedures, mediation and arbitration, with the right to strike as a last resort.
The second lesson, Mr. Shultz said, is that "free societies and free trade unions go together." It is no accident, he said, that the first thing a dictator does is to get rid of the free trade unions, if there are any. "And it's not an accident," he added, "that a lot of the fire for what happened in Eastern European countries came out of a trade union, Solidarity." Societies that lack the kind of organization that will "really get up on its hind legs and fight about freedom" are missing something.
He noted that in the American private business sector, trade union membership was down to 12 percent of the labor force. Only 10.2 million workers of 84.6 million employed by private businesses now are members of unions. Government unions now have 6.5 million members of 17.8 million employed by Federal, state and local government; that is 36.5 percent of public employment compared with 12.1 percent of private employment. Total private and public union membership in this country is down to 16.1 percent of employment from 34 percent in 1957 and 24 percent in 1973.
Concern about the shrinking size and role of organized labor in the private sector was striking, coming from a man who has not only held the top positions at State, Treasury, Labor and the Office of Management and Budget in Republican Administrations, but has also been president of the Bechtel Group Inc., and is a director of Bechtel, General Motors, Boeing, Chevron, the Morgan Bank and Tandem Computers.
"As a management person," he said, "if I'm running my shop and I don't have a union, I don't want them. But I'm trying to look at this more broadly and ask a question about where we're heading, and I think the monkey is really on the unions' back as much as anything to show a function in a world that is changing rapidly -- the whole workplace is changing, the patterns of competition are changing." Yet, he said, the underlying reality remains that in the workplace restraints on power are needed and, "as a society, we have a great stake in freedom and a lot of that is anchored somehow, historically," in the labor movement.
Why has the labor movement declined? "I don't quite know why that is," Mr. Shultz said. But he thought the nation needed better understanding of how the union role affects the nation's well-being in a rapidly changing industrial and global economic environment.
Sar A. Levitan, director of the Center for Social Policy Studies at George Washington University, attributes organized labor's decline to a combination of factors, including the "unfriendly courts and Government of the 1980's," first signaled by the Reagan Administration's breaking of the air traffic controllers' strike and the unions' inability to make necessary adjustments to the changing labor market, with the entry of more women and minority workers.
The unions, Mr. Levitan said, allowed their functions to be taken over by "a multiplicity of women's, racial and other groups." The unions, he said, did not give leadership roles to people from those groups and "could not take up the cudgels" to fight their causes.
Some business leaders, including at Bechtel, share Mr. Shultz's concern that from a broad social and economic standpoint, the decline of the unions may prove costly. Though it may make sense from the standpoint of the individual company to lay off workers and force down wages, from an overall national standpoint, there goes labor income, purchasing power, consumer confidence and the producers' sales. There is macroeconomic danger ahead if layoffs and payroll slashing become a national fad, the only weapon for raising productivity, and the prime test of managerial guts.

HEADLINE: SOVIET DISARRY;
Baker Sees Opportunities and Risks as Soviet Republics Grope for Stability

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: PRINCETON, N.J., Dec. 12

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a speech by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d today at Princeton University:
The dramatic collapse of Communism in Moscow and the unraveling of the centralized Soviet state confront the West with great opportunities, yes, but also with ominous dangers. Popularly elected leaders now run large and strategically important republics, including Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan. They look to America and the West for guidance and help in launching genuine, far-reaching political and economic reform. If they can succeed, the centuries-old menace posed to the West, first by czarist autocracy and then by Soviet totalitarianism, will have been permanently altered. 
 The opportunities are historic. We have the chance to anchor Russia, Ukraine and other republics firmly in the Euro-Atlantic community and the democratic commonwealth of nations.
We have the chance to bring democracy to lands that have little knowledge of it, an achievement that can transcend centuries of history.
We have the chance, indeed, to help harness the rich human and material resources of those vast lands to the cause of freedom instead of totalitarianism, thereby immeasurably enhancing the security, the prosperity, and freedom of America and the world.
Yet the dangers are equal in scale to the opportunities. Economically, the old Soviet system has collapsed, multiplying every day the threats these reformers face from social dislocation to political fragmentation to ethnic violence. Reconstructing economies that have been devastated by central planning is even more difficult than reconstruction from the devastation of war.
Politically, the dangers of protracted anarchy and chaos are obvious. Great empires rarely go quietly into extinction. No one can dismiss the possibility that darker political forces lurk in the wings, representing the remnants of Stalinism or the birth of nationalist extremism or even fascism, ready to exploit the frustrations of a proud but exhausted people in their hour of despair.
Strategically, both of these alternatives, anarchy or reaction, could become threats to the West's vital interests when they shake a land that is still home to nearly 30,000 nuclear weapons and the most powerful arsenal of conventional weaponry ever amassed in Europe.
Taken together, these dangers serve, I think, as a call to action for America and the West. This historic watershed, the collapse of Communist power in Bolshevism's birthplace, marks the challenge that history has dealt us: to see the end of the Soviet empire turned into a beginning for democracy and economic freedom . . . across the former Soviet Empire.
Here is what we think the West must do:
*As we organized an alliance against Stalinism during the cold war, today America can mobilize a coalition in support of freedom.
*Together with our NATO allies, Japan, South Korea, the other O.E.C.D. states, our gulf coalition partners and international institutions, we must pursue a diplomacy of collective engagement.
*Together with the new democrats in the former Soviet Union, we can help create pathways of hope so that the New Russian Revolution can fulfill the promise of the next generation.

 	 	 		. . .	 	To multiply the value of our efforts, the international coalition must divide its labors. The wreckage of Communism is too large for any one nation to go it alone or to try and do everything. Working in concert, we must make use of the comparative advantages that each of us holds.

 	 	 		. . .	 	To crystallize this coalition, the President proposes that we begin by holding a coordinating conference to better divide our labor and responsibilities to help meet immediate and drastically increasing Soviet humanitarian needs. The United States will invite the advanced industrial democracies, the Central and Eastern European states, the members of the gulf war coalition, and the international financial institutions to join us in Washington in early January to discuss how best to meet ongoing humanitarian needs over the course of the next year.
This conference should work toward helping the Soviet peoples help themselves to get through the winter and to insure that together we take the right steps this winter, spring and summer to insure a better situation next winter. Our work should focus on critical short-term needs: food, medicine, fuel, shelter. In the meantime, the United States will continue its ambitious food and medical assistance program that the President announced a year ago today.
But our collective engagement must extend beyond immediate humanitarian needs and it should be organized around three tasks:
*First and foremost, we must help the Soviets destroy and control the military remnants of the cold war.
*Second, we must help our former adversaries understand the ways of democracy to build political legitimacy out of the wreckage of totalitarianism.
*And third, we must help free-market forces stimulate economic stabilization and recovery in the lands of the former Soviet Union.
Obviously, one of the most vexing questions we face is: Who is the authority or authorities with whom we can deal? In a revolution where political authority has diffused and fractured, the possible interlocutors seem almost endless. In the face of such uncertainty, the West we think should stick to fundamentals and support those who put into practice, those, wherever they may be found, who put into practice our principles and values.
This means that we will work with those republics and with any common entity which commit to responsible security policies, democratic political practices and free-market economics. Fortunately, new leaders are emerging who are committed to these principles.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Unless republic governments respond by complementing their independence with democracy and the equal treatment of persons belonging to minorities, they will soon find themselves suffering the very same crises of legitimacy, cohesion and effectiveness that has caused the centrifugal devolution of power in the Soviet Union itself.
Without legitimacy, there will never be stability, and, without stability, Western security will never be assured.
As I noted when I laid out our five principles in the aftermath of the coup attempt on September the 4th, the United States will welcome into the community of democratic nations those new political entities who believe in democratic values and follow democratic practices; who safeguard human rights including equal treatment of minorities; who respect borders and commit to changes only through peaceful and consensual means; and who will adhere to the international obligations and the norms and practices of the Helsinki Final Act and the Charter of Paris.
But we will isolate those who cloak Stalinism or fascism in a facade of nationalist or liberal or democratic rhetoric.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Now, while we work with Russians, Ukrainians, Kazakhs and others to destroy weapons and to cultivate democracy, the Russian winter, just as in 1812, 1917, and 1941, may again influence history's course.
As the economy collapses with no bottom in sight, the onset of cold weather is exacerbating the situation and is creating acute food, medicine, and energy shortages.
To meet these rapidly expanding needs, the United States has already this year shipped 18 millions tons of food, the largest by far of any Western country.
We have granted $4 billion in C.C.C. food and grant credits this year, $2.3 billion of those just since the August coup.
Through the President's emergency medical initiative, we've shipped through Project Hope close to $20 million in medical supplies and we plan to double this amount over the next eighteen months.
These supplies, which are all donated by American firms and average citizens, have reached the Soviet peoples where they need them most: in the Urals, in the Aral Sea region of Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan, and the Chernobyl region of Ukraine, as well as in Armenia, Moscow, and soon in Belorus.
Over $8 million of these medical supplies have gone to the Baltic countries, and with their independence, the President has created a new and separate program for them.
To facilitate meeting humanitarian needs, we will deliver or expend $165 million in Department of Agriculture grant funds to meet food shortages this winter, and we will draw upon the $100 million Congress has just authorized to transport humanitarian assistance.
We are also acting at this very moment to send food stocks left over from Desert Storm to regions in critical need: Armenia, the industrial cities of the Urals, and Moscow and St. Petersburg. The first shipments of these will be delivered by United States C-5 military aircraft to St. Petersburg and to Moscow next week.
Beyond the humanitarian problems, we know that, at least over the near term, democracy and free markets are unlikely to succeed everywhere across the lands of the Soviet Union as we knew it. There are likely to be "islands" of democracy and free markets that have to stand as bulwarks against other "islands" of chaos or authoritarianism, perhaps even fascism. In this environment, the democrats in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Armenia and elsewhere must be able to offer pathways of hope to a better future.
We can help them define that path. For they will turn to us, to America and to Americans, as inspirations for the future, as sources of advice, and as partners in their work. And we can engage with our friends and allies by starting with human capital: people.
In this connection, the best way the West can help is to place Western experts on the ground and to bring Russians, Ukrainians, Kazakhs and others here for training.
The President has already approved an effort to put Americans on the ground to solve long-term food distribution problems; several American firms have offered their executives and will cover the costs to assist this effort.
While much of this effort will have to be done through the private sector, assisted by organizations like the Citizens Democracy Corps, the administration is proposing several steps to augment our ongoing U.S.I.A. efforts and to expand the human factor:
*We will work with the Congress to support an expanded Peace Corps program in at least four republics. And I would like to see at least 250 Peace Corps volunteers on the ground by next winter.
*We will expand Commerce's Business Training Program to accommodate 150 Soviet interns in the coming year.
*We will work with numerous voluntary organizations to look into ways they might expand their presence.
Clearly, of course, the bulk of responsibility must lie with republic leaders who have already assumed primary control over economic policy and resources. They must make the hard choices necessary for economic recovery.

 	 	 		. . .	 	For the administration's part, we intend to be a catalyst for this partnership. We will work with the business community to help bring American business into Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Armenia and other reforming republics. As a part of this commitment, we are taking the following immediate steps:
*The President today is announcing that Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence Eagleburger will be the United States Government coordinator for all of these assistance efforts. . . .
*We intend to propose authorizing legislation to the Congress, on its return, to facilitate our efforts to provide assistance and technical cooperation. A major aim of this legislation will be to promote trade business, and investment development by American companies in Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan and other republics. In addition, the Administration will conduct a thorough review of barriers to American business operating there to make it easier for American businesses to join this effort.
*We will put together, in consultation with Congress, a $100 million technical assistance program for the coming calendar year. Again, a major aim of this program will be to use Government funds to catalyze private sector involvement. This money will, of course, not come from domestic accounts but from assistance to other foreign nations. And given the gravity of the situation, there is no other choice.
*The President will ask the heads of the Trade and Development Program, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and the Export-Import Bank to examine the possibility of focusing some of their efforts on facilitating the work of American business in the food distribution, energy, and housing sectors.

 	 	 		. . .	 	I believe that having prevailed over the twin fears of nuclear war and Stalinism, we can prevail over the tyranny of the spirit that might threaten reform and democracy and that might bring darkness to our lives as well. We can prevail as well over the fearful isolationism that threatens to return us to the failures of the '20s and the '30s.
We can prevail over political paralysis to forge a bipartisan consensus about what has to be done, and then, united at home, we can join with our allies to form a new coalition. A coalition for a diplomacy of collective engagement. A coalition to create pathways of hope. A coalition to make of the end of the cold war a beginning, a new beginning for all the nations of the world.
Ladies and gentlemen, history and the American people expect no less of us.

HEADLINE: The Art Market

BYLINE: By Carol Vogel

 BODY:

Suspended: Journal of Art
There seems to be a lot more activity in art publishing right now than in the art market itself.
The biggest news is Rizzoli's announcement that it has suspended publication of The Journal of Art. It was not a gradual slowdown: At 4 P.M. the day before Thanksgiving, the entire staff was dismissed with a week's severance pay. "They told us they didn't need to give us the two weeks' pay we were entitled to because the journal had just suspended publication, not folded," said the circulation director, Helen Ryan. "Then, in the same breath, they told us to file for unemployment and to look for another job." 
 The editor, Barbara Rose, a 30 percent shareholder in the journal, and one of the co-publishers, Alexis Gregory, who owns 10 percent, are suing Rizzoli, which owns 60 percent and decided to close the publication against their wishes. According to legal documents filed in the lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan on Nov. 13, Ms. Rose initially invested $300,000 and Mr. Gregory put in $100,000 to rescue the journal from bankruptcy in February 1990. That month, Rizzoli added $600,000 to the investment to take control of the publication. Since then, the company has invested $1.5 million more, according to various art-world sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity.
"The whole thing is a horror show," Ms. Rose said in a telephone interview the other day. "They have bankrupted me, ruined me and made me sick." She said Rizzoli stopped paying her $100,000-a-year consulting fee in September and also had not honored her five-year contract as editor of The Journal of Art.
Gianfranco Monacelli, the president and chief executive officer at Rizzoli International Publications, says the company owes Ms. Rose no money. "We have fulfilled our obligations and more than that," he said yesterday. "This was an unfortunate situation, but in today's economic climate we felt there was a limit to what the corporation could afford."
Trouble began, some former employees say, almost as soon as Rizzoli became the majority shareholder. Those running the publication -- Mr. Gregory, Ms. Rose and Alfredo de Marzio, the other co-publisher, who is chairman of RCS, Rizzoli's American holding company -- were constantly fighting. Mr. Gregory and Ms. Rose asserted in their lawsuit that Rizzoli charged disproportionate amounts of its corporate overhead to the journal for offices within Rizzoli office space and that Rizzoli also disproportionately charged the publication for a computer system used by other Rizzoli publications.
Circulation kept rising, however; Ms. Rose said it nearly quadrupled since the time Rizzoli assumed control. At the time it stopped publishing, The Journal of Art had about 35,000 readers, More than 20,000 were paid subscriptions; the rest came from newsstand sales and free distribution at international art fairs. The publication was also averaging about 45 pages of paid advertising in each 100-page issue. "And the advertising was steadily going up, which was amazing, considering the recession," said the advertising director, Michael Benevento.
Now it is rumored that Mr. de Marzio, the co-publisher, has left Rizzoli. Although no official announcement has been made and the company is denying it, friends said he had told them he was going on a long vacation in Europe and leaving the company. When Mr. de Marzio was called for comment, Mr. Monacelli responded, saying Mr. de Marzio was out of the country and could not be reached for comment.
Meanwhile, Rizzoli is busy looking for a buyer so it can recoup its investment of more than $2 million. No purchase price has been made public. Last week, Maureen and Marshall Cogan, owners of Art and Auction, a general-audience magazine for collectors and art mavens, were reported to be serious contenders, but not any longer. Given the struggle all magazines are facing right now with dropping advertising, and the widespread rumor that Art and Auction is losing money, the Cogans have backed off.
"I decided to concentrate on the two magazines I have," said Mrs. Cogan, referring to Art and Auction and International Design Magazine. Rizzoli is still hoping someone will come along to rescue The Journal of Art. Rumors have been circulating that Brant Publications, owners of Art in America, The Magazine Antiques and Interview, are looking into the purchase. Mrs. Brant could not be reached for comment, but Ms. Rose denied the rumors. Mr. Monacelli said, "We've had a flood of interest, but none of it serious." As for the lawsuit, he said, "I cannot go into details."
 
Sold: Art and Antiques
 Art and Antiques magazine has been sold to the Atlanta-based Transworld Publications, owned by Douglas Billian, its president and chief executive. The 12-year-old magazine reportedly sold for $1,250,000.
This is not Mr. Billian's first foray into the art-and-antiques world. Two and a half years ago, he acquired Antiques Monthly. Since then, circulation has increased from 19,000 to 44,000, Mr. Billian said in a telephone interview this week. "That's not to say we're financially out of the woods yet," he said. "But things are looking up."
His latest purchase, a more arts-oriented, general-interest publication, has a circulation of 151,000, Mr. Billian said. Some consider it an imitation of Connoisseur. "We're not trying to increase it, but rather to make sure the publication fits the reader," he said. Therefore the company has embarked on a serious marketing research program. It is also trying to increase advertising, which has been running 25 percent below last year's figures, he said.
As for editorial plans, Mr. Billian said he was keeping the same editorial staff and working on plans to use some of the same articles in both publications, tailored to each one's readers. "Art and Antiques is aimed at a more general audience than Antiques Monthly," he said. "It won't just be for collectors, but for people who would like to be able to afford to collect."
 
Expanding: Art News
 Art News, the biggest of the art magazines (it reports its circulation at 74,000), is also branching out. In October it plans to launch Art News Japan in conjunction with Dohosha Publishing Company of Kyoto.
"Fifty percent of the editorial will be from the U.S. edition; the rest will be created locally," said the editor and publisher, Milton Esterow. "Initially we'll be printing about 30,000 copies of the Japanese edition."
Art News has also joined forces with Prestel, a Munich-based publishing company, to publish monographs on artists and photographers under the name Art News/Prestel. "I've also got four magazines on the drawing board," Mr. Esterow said. "I'm an optimist. When I bought Art News in 1972, people thought I was crazy. But I'm looking forward to a bright future."

The Hellinger Sale
"It's a sign of the times," says James N. Nederlander, chairman of the Nederlander Organization, on the recent sale of its Mark Hellinger Theater, considered a prime musical theater on Broadway, to its longtime tenant, the Times Square Church. 
 "The church had three more years on their lease," Mr. Nederlander says. "And there are no productions around now to fill the theater. We have enough musical houses -- a surplus, as far as we're concerned. If you haven't got anything to put in it, what can you do?"
O.K., times are hard. But after all the efforts in the last few years to preserve theaters by giving them landmark status, why not sell the Hellinger to legitimate theater operators? Mr. Nederlander says that in years past, Michael Bennett, Cameron Mackintosh and Jujamcyn Theaters all expressed interest in buying the theater. But the price was never right. Although Mr. Nederlander would not give the exact figure of the sale, an executive close to the negotiation says it was $17 million.
"There is no way a theater operator can compete with that price," says Rocco Landesman, president of Jujamcyn. "To make it work, an operator couldn't pay more for it than $5 million to $7 million. Even if you take $15 million as the figure, you pay 10 percent interest a year, which is $1.5 million, plus utilities and operating overhead. You have to make $2 million a year just to break even. Even with a really hot Broadway musical, you couldn't make the numbers work."
"What this proves," he adds, "is that landmarking a building doesn't save a theater."
Bernard B. Jacobs and Gerald Schoenfeld, president and chairman, respectively, of the Shubert Organization, Nederlander's major competitor (it owns 16 theaters to Nederlander's 10), declined to comment on the sale. Harvey Sabinson, executive director of the American League of Theaters and Producers, also declined to comment.
Mr. Nederlander says: "This city treats the theaters like orphans. In London, when a theater goes dark, they waive the taxes, but not here. Still, we continue to be in the market for new theaters. We just bought the Shubert in Chicago and the Dominion in London. We need them in cities where we can book them."
Compounding Mr. Nederlander's economic woes in New York is the scheduled closing of the musical "Nick and Nora" on Sunday. It is said that his investment was $1.5 million. "The papers didn't like it, so that's what it is," he says evenly. "In this business, you have to move forward."
 
New Dancers at 'Lughnasa'
 For everyone who has fallen in love with the cast of Brian Friel's "Dancing at Lughnasa" and keeps asking if the Irish actors from the Abbey Theater in Dublin will stay longer than the 20 weeks allowed by Actors' Equity, the answer is no. The company will stay only until March 1, after which the parts must be played by American actors. But when the snob appeal of the Abbey is gone, will the producer, Noel Pearson, go Broadway and find big names to keep profits strong? Can we all look forward to Pia Zadora in "Lughnasa"?
Absolutely not, Mr. Pearson says. "Brian and I have made a very conscious decision to go for an ensemble team like the one we have. There will be no stars, just the best possible actors available. There's quite a lot of Irish-American actors here, you know." Mr. Pearson says he has been approached by a number of stars who want to join the cast, although he declined to name them. He notes that the actor Donal Donnelly will remain in the play, since he had the foresight to belong to the Abbey and live in Connecticut.
"These people in the cast have been doing the play for nearly two years now, in Dublin and London, before they even got here," Mr. Pearson says. "They have children and families, and they want to go home." But some, he says, will return to the United States for the play's national tour, to begin next fall.
 
Playing With Food
 It may look as if Blue Man Group is making an arbitrary mess down at the Astor Place Theater, where its show, "Tubes," is playing. But just for the record, this is art, darling, albeit with a sense of humor, and much of it is edible.
Of the three blue men, Matt Goldman, Phil Stanton and Chris Wink, the last two are former employees of the caterer Glorious Foods, where they learned to use their time, and leftovers, wisely. In one sketch, marshmallows are continually tossed into Mr. Wink's mouth until you think it will burst. But real marshmallows aren't the right consistency for the desired effect. While they were still catering, Mr. Wink says, they had great success with leftover chevre. But once they had to pay for it themselves, they switched to cream cheese, which is molded to resemble marshmallows. Mr. Wink says he is happy with the results, but he has eliminated cream cheese from his everyday life.
Another sketch revolves around the trio and a guest from the audience eating Twinkie Lights. While the Twinkies are being daintily sliced with knife and fork, Twinkie cream starts spurting from the performer's chests. But the cream is really whole bananas being pushed through 20 feet of tubing connected to an air pump and operated individually by foot pedals. It takes two hours just to load one person's tubing. The trio arrives at the theater every day at noon to do this and numerous other intricate setups.
Then there's the Jell-O, 80 pounds a week. It is made in individual molds by Jean-Claude Nedelac, the chef at Glorious Foods. Since the Jell-O is sent flying in one sketch, it is made with a minimum of water to be as dry as possible. The Blue Men say some people take it home as a souvenir.
As for their skin color, they say this isn't just any blue, but Yves Klein blue, inspired by the artist who invented his own shade for its spiritual qualities. It is nontoxic watercolor. "We find stuff used by kids," Mr. Wink says, "since everything we use seems to end up in the mouth."
 
Readings of Capote
 Starting on Sunday, and through Dec. 22 at the Book Friends Cafe, 16 West 18th Street, Chelsea, you can hear Truman Capote's "Christmas Memory" read by a variety of theater stars, including Stockard Channing and Courtney B. Vance, Madeline Kahn, Irene Worth, B. D. Wong, Elaine Stritch and Kevin Spacey, Judith Ivey and Nathan Lane, and Lea Salonga and Howard McGillin. Tickets are $12 Tuesday through Thursday and $15 on the weekend. All proceeds will go to Equity Fights AIDS. Tickets: (212) 982-8356.


GRAPHIC: It will be Glenn Close, not Juliet Stevenson, co-starring in "Death and the Maiden" with Gene Hackman and Richard Dreyfuss. Mike Nichols is to direct Ariel Dorfman's play about a woman seeking revenge on a man who raped and tortured her. Miss Stevenson, who stars in the London production, had been mentioned for the role. The play is to open at the Brooks Atkinson on March 12.

HEADLINE: Lebanon Says French Aide's Visit Opens a New Era of Cooperation

BYLINE: By IHSAN A. HIJAZI, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BEIRUT, Lebanon, Dec. 12

 BODY:
Lebanon and France began today what officials here called a new era of close cooperation as the French Foreign Minister, Roland Dumas, began a two-day visit, the first by a senior French official in six years.
"The visit reflects the special relationship between the two countries and heralds a new era of cooperation between them," the Lebanese Foreign Minister, Faris Bouez, told reporters after talks with his guest, who will also be going to Syria and Jordan. A French diplomat said Mr. Dumas would explore possibilities for French help in promoting the Middle East peace process, which is co-sponsored by the United States and the Soviet Union. 
 Lebanese leaders attach great importance to Mr. Dumas's visit. The Beirut Government hopes to re-establish Lebanon's traditionally intimate relationship with France, its former colonial master.
French-Lebanese relations soured last year in a dispute over Michel Aoun, a renegade Lebanese Army general who claimed to be the legitimate president of Lebanon. After an attack by Syrian and Lebanese troops drove him from his stronghold in the presidential palace in a Christian suburb of Beirut, General Aoun took refuge at the nearby French Embassy, and France rejected repeated requests from the Government of President Elias Hrawi that it hand him over.
The problem was resolved last summer when General Aoun was allowed to leave the embassy and go to France to live in exile. This cleared the way for a state visit to Paris in October by Mr. Hrawi, who said Lebanon's old relations with France were back on track.
Lebanese officials also hope the Dumas visit will lead to increased French assistance for Lebanese reconstruction.
Lebanon's Prime Minister, Omar Karami, is in Paris taking part in a special session of the World Bank, which is considering plans for aid to rebuild Lebanon after 15 years of civil war. Mr. Karami said he would ask the bank for $4.5 billion to finance the reconstruction of his country's electricity, water, telecommunications and other networks. He estimated Lebanon's total reconstruction bill at $15 billion.

HEADLINE: Guatemalans Irked by U.S. Pressure in Killing

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GUATEMALA, Dec. 6

 BODY:
Pressure by the Bush Administration for the prosecution of army officers for the killing of an American innkeeper in rural Guatemala 18 months ago has raised resentments in the Guatemalan Army leadership.
Gen. Luis Enrique Mendoza Garcia, who was Defense Minister until his dismissal today, recently said, "We don't have any reason to plead guilty to the United States." 
 He asserted that the prosecution of the case "is proceeding according to our judicial procedures and is moving toward a conclusion."
Seven enlisted men have been charged in the killing of the innkeeper, Michael DeVine, but three officers were ordered freed after questioning by a military tribunal.
No explanation was given for the sudden replacement of General Mendoza and his Chief of Staff, but this case is one of several rumored areas of difference between President Jorge Serrano Elias and General Mendoza. He was replaced by Gen. Jose Garcia Samayoa.
Publicly, however, President Serrano has stood behind the army command. In an interview two days before the dismissal, he complained that the United States had made the DeVine case "the central point" in relations between the two countries and asserted that his Government was not part of any cover-up.
"It hurts that they have not recognized the attitude of impartiality of my Government," he added. "We have been absolutely crystal clear in the handling of this case. I have said this to President Bush himself; they have to understand there is no cover-up on our part."
The United States asserts that the army is blocking prosecution of some of its officers in the death of Mr. DeVine, who with his wife, Carol, ran a farm and guesthouse near Poptun in the department of Peten.
Guatemalan officials say American officials simply do not understand Latin legal procedures and are being disrespectful of Guatemalan sovereignty.
President Serrano asserted that private investigators and lawyers hired by Mrs. DeVine were trying, with the help of pressure applied by the United States Embassy, to get the Government and the army to force certain officers to make accusations against others. He said visas to the United States were offered, and other inducements, which he characterized as bribes.
But former President Vinicio Cerezo, who was in office at the time of the killing, recently acknowledged in a magazine interview that some officers "tried to hide evidence" after the killing.
Mr. DeVine, 49 years old, was kidnapped at the entrance to his farm on the afternoon of June 8, 1990, by a group of men in a white Toyota pickup truck, witnesses said. His body was found early the next morning. His hands were bound, there were signs of strangulation, and the head had been partly severed with a machete.
Initially, the killing was thought to have been a common crime, with robbery the motive. But after the investigation led to the nearby army base, the Bush Administration cut off Guatemala's small military aid allotment, $2.9 million, and began to help Mrs. DeVine in seeking arrests and prosecution.
For the United States, the DeVine case has become the top priority on a list of several cases involving abuses by the armed forces. The United States Congress approved a joint resolution conditioning continued economic aid to Guatemala on progress in the prosecution of this and several other cases.
Progress has been made on resolving some of the cases. In case, an army officer and a sergeant were convicted and sentenced to 4 and 16 years respectively for the massacre of 13 residents of the village of Santiago Atitlan a year ago.
In another, a former member of the army's presidential guard, Noel de Jesus Beteta Alvarez, was arrested in California on Nov. 29 for illegal entry and deported to Guatemala to face charges of stabbing to death Myrna Mack Chang, a prominent Guatemalan anthropologist.

HEADLINE: Comrades in Arms

BYLINE: By Fred C. Ikle; Fred C. Ikle was Under Secretary of Defense in the Reagan Administration. A longer version of this article will appear in the winter issue of The National Interest.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
To start building a lasting peace, Washington should work with Moscow to create an American-Russian Defense Community. This arrangement could take its inspiration from the economic communities formed in Western Europe in the 1950's that made French-German reconciliation irreversible.
The U.S. and Soviet defense establishments have grown unusually warm toward each other; the Soviet military in particular is becoming more open as it undergoes internal stress and upheaval. Military leaders in Russia and the other republics seem eager to reduce nuclear weapons quickly, and they welcome American assistance to make that possible. Many senior officers are showing keen interest in the American principle of civilian control of the military, in U.S. help to prevent nuclear proliferation and in a cooperative approach to creating defenses against missiles from third world countries 
 Ending the adversarial relationship between both military establishments might take years. The confrontation in Central Europe has ended, but other steps must follow in three basic areas: each side's preparations for war, the training and deployment of forces and the developing and testing of weapons.
So far, Americans are resisting changes needed to form a military community more than the Soviets seem to be. Having recently visited Moscow, I have the impression that the end of the cold war has been accepted more readily there than in Washington. The hoary idea that NATO might have to use nuclear arms against conventional attack lingers in U.S. doctrine. And many American nuclear technicians believe that U.S. nuclear testing must continue whether or not testing in the former Soviet Union resumes.
The Defense Community would have to carry out at least four missions to avoid becoming a home for bureaucrats forever in search of a purpose yet always busy with organizational charts.
It would have to eliminate the confrontation between nuclear forces, especially the hair-trigger readiness. It would need to phase out the secrecy between the two establishments. It would need to take steps against nuclear proliferation without running roughshod over the sovereignty of nations with legitimate nuclear programs. And, through efforts (including military maneuvers) in former republics, it would have to strengthen the understanding of the principle of civilian control of the military.
While abandoning the cold war approach to arms control, the community should not seek merely to stabilize the military balance and reduce arms. We can learn from the 1920's, when the major powers, using elaborate naval treaties, sought in vain to stabilize the balance in strategic arms. Instead of keeping the peace by overcoming the sense of military rivalry, they tried to keep the confrontation peaceful. But the naval staffs continued to consider each other adversaries, modernized their navies -- and planned the next war.
An American-Russian Defense Community can end the nuclear standoff. At the end of the road, restructured nuclear forces would co-exist, much like the French and British nuclear forces, without concern about the stability of mutual deterrence. Do French generals worry if their nuclear forces can deter perfidious Albion from launching a first strike against France?
Without the bonding of the defense communities, political forces might push the military, at least in the Russian republic, into a new confrontation with the U.S. There might be a new arms race between the two countries resulting from efforts to defend themselves against other countries such as Iraq, Iran and perhaps China.
Some U.S. defense planners seem too sanguine about our ability to again contain such an expansionist Russia. The Pentagon properly has plans for reconstituting the armed forces over two or three years. But a decision to rearm against a fascist-imperialist Muscovite empire would create discord. We would return to the Vietnam years, not the Truman years, when containment was so successfully launched. Americans and our allies would ask how democracy's victory that ended the cold war could have been foolishly squandered.

HEADLINE: Canadian Health System Continues to Do Well

 BODY:
To the Editor:
A Nov. 24 news article wrongly implies that the Canadian Government is stuck with a politically popular health-care program that the nation cannot afford. Hospital bed closings do not necessarily imply reduction of service. Hospital treatment has represented a much higher proportion of the health-care budget because universal medical coverage began with hospitals: services performed in them were insured, while the same procedure in a doctor's office was not. 
 The concentration of service in hospitals became unnecessary as the program expanded to cover all medical treatment, but earlier expansions had created an enormous number of beds that are now better left unfilled in favor of chronic-care facilities, outpatient services and other more humane, less expensive alternatives.
The fear-mongering done in the United States about waiting lists should also be examined. We have waiting lists for surgery, especially elective surgery. Priority is given to those most in need of the operation, not to those best able to buy their way to the head of the line. No doubt, many hospitals in the United States have no waiting lists -- why be on a list if you will never be able to pay for the operation anyway?
It is true that our federal and provincial governments are seeking ways to cut health-care costs. So are your governments, while the United States spends more of its gross national product on health than Canada does and tolerates infant mortality rates that rival third world countries.
I know that your medical establishment will wage war on proposals to introduce our system. So did our doctors at first, and in some cases those who were in medicine principally for personal enrichment left for the United States. If a billing cap of $400,000 a year for a doctor is parsimonious, perhaps we were recruiting the wrong people into the profession. However, this has not been a serious problem because many doctors prefer not to act as collection agencies.
An informed debate on our system will look at the results: the health of the population and the freedom from the corrosive anxiety that attends loss of benefits or illness in the family.

 BODY:
For months, as the United States has raised a heavy metal barricade along its border with Mexico here, officials of the two countries have argued over the symbolism. The Mexicans call it a wall, like the Berlin wall; the Americans say it is just a strong fence.
But each night around midnight, hundreds of men and women clamber over the 10-foot-high structure to offer another definition: It has become a monument, their numbers suggest, to the impossibility of keeping poor foreign workers from better-paid jobs. 
 After a decline following the immigration-control law of 1986, illegal immigration has rebounded strongly, according to recent United States Government statistics and other evidence. And despite stepped-up border enforcement, and a barrier that officials say will eventually close off 12 miles of the border just south of San Diego, experts say that the flow will almost certainly remain high for years.
Both President Bush and President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico have pointed to the free trade agreement they are negotiating with Canada as an important step toward solving the problem. But a growing number of researchers say free trade would take years, if not decades, longer than officials have suggested to raise Mexican wages and employment enough to dim the attraction of American jobs. For some time, many experts say, the disruptions of free trade might even cause illegal immigration to rise.
"Free trade has been oversold as a quick fix to the immigration problem," said Wayne A. Cornelius, the director of the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at the University of California at San Diego.
"Most people are focusing on two, three years," Dr. Cornelius said. "You've got to think in terms of 10, 15, 20 years for a free trade agreement to have a demonstrably significant impact on the volume and kind of labor migration that is occurring between the two countries."
For the moment, debate over what free trade might achieve has been overtaken by questions about whether political concerns might prompt the White House to keep a treaty from Congress until after the 1992 elections. The timing of a trade agreement is expected to dominate talks between Mr. Bush and Mr. Salinas at Camp David on Saturday.
American officials have kept immigration questions out of the free trade negotiations. Undocumented immigration has also virtually disappeared as a point of friction, reflecting better relations between the United States and Mexico.
But immigration itself has surged. New figures released last month by the Immigration and Naturalization Service show that for the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, apprehensions at the Mexican border rose slightly to 1,077,511 from 1,049,680 in 1990. Both years were up considerably from the 854,128 arrests recorded in 1989, the last of three years that registered a decline.
The numbers represent an uncertain fraction of the people entering the United States illegally, and immigration officials attribute part of the rise to better enforcement.
 
'Business as Usual'
 Jorge Bustamante, president of Tijuana's College of the Northern Border, a leading center for immigration research, said the institute's projections showed the illegal traffic stabilizing near pre-1986 levels.
"It has returned to business as usual," Dr. Bustamante said.
Immigration experts and U.S. officials say the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act, which require employers to verify that their workers are not illegal immigrants, has been undermined by a series of developments, including weak I.N.S. enforcement of penalties against those who do hire undocumented workers.
Researchers say the law's legalization of 3.1 million foreigners has also created a magnet for those immigrants' relatives and friends. Mexicans call these immigrants "los rodinos," after Representative Peter W. Rodino Jr., a New JerseyDemocrat who sponsored the 1986 law in the House.
But most important, underlying economic reasons for the flow have not changed on either side of the border.
In Mexico, inflation has dropped sharply and economic growth is up to 4 percent a year after nearly a decade of crisis. Yet 44 million Mexicans still qualify as impoverished, underemployment remains high, real wages are at about what they were in 1980 and, on average, Mexico pays its workers about one-eighth what they can earn in the United States.
To the north, meanwhile, low-paying jobs in agricultural and service industries remain easily available. In California, for example, lawn and gardening services have roughly doubled their workforce since the early 1980's.
The economics were simple to Fernando Lopez, 24 years old, who waited recently to hop the barricade into California with three other "chickens," as the migrants are called.
Their guide had led them into California four times in two days, and into the Border Patrol's clutches each time. "That's equal to two days of work," said Mr. Lopez, who earned $30 or $40 a week as a carpenter in the central state of Michoacan. But, he added, "Next week, I will make $300."
To stem the tide of such migration, , economists say, Mexican wages do not have to rise to United States levels, but merely come closer. Philip L. Martin, an agricultural economist at the University of California at Davis, said European experiences suggest that migration would begin to ebb when Mexican pay rises from one-eighth the American equivalent to one-fourth.
But some Mexican analysts have argued that such a shift would run counter to a basic equation of free trade: that new jobs will be created in Mexico precisely because of its low labor costs. And while most economists consider it inevitable that the wage gap will narrow, they said that could take anywhere from 10 years to two generations.
In the meantime, new laws allowing Mexican peasants to sell their community lands, along with an expected end to the subsidies that Mexico pays its corn farmers, could propel more people northward. And experts wonder if the jobs that free trade might create in northern Mexico could actually foster illegal immigration by drawing people to the edge of the United States.
The idea of a free trade agreement seemed far off the other night for Luis Campos, another Michoacan native, who earns $10 an hour collecting trash in Anaheim, Calif.; in his hometown of Puruandiro, he said, he made barely $500 a year growing beans and corn.
As for the barrier that the I.N.S. and a military construction corps have halfway completed, Mr. Campos said that it did not make sense. His life is in the United States, he said, and all five of his children were born there.
"We don't do anyone any harm," he said as he leaned against the barricade. "We work hard. I don't know why they just don't let us in."

HEADLINE: EFFORT TO REPEAL NEW TAX ON INCOME FAILS IN HARTFORD

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. today vetoed a plan to repeal Connecticut's new income tax only 30 minutes after it was approved, asserting that the legislature had embarked on a path of "full-scale surrender to fiscal gimmicks and political fantasies." The House then failed to override his veto, eliminating all hope for repeal of the income tax this year.
Although neither the veto nor the failure to override it came as a great surprise here, the day's events nonetheless stood out as landmarks in the 10 months of conflict and passion that have informed the tax debate, capturing both Mr. Weicker's resolve and the legislature's inability to thwart him. 
 Four times the legislature has tried to solve the state's fiscal crisis without taxing wages. And four times the lawmakers' plans have been rejected by Mr. Weicker, a third-party independent governor without a single member of his tiny party in the General Assembly.
 
Looking Now to '92
 "I surrender; we've lost -- for today," said Representative Vincent J. Chase, a Republican from Stratford, speaking on the House floor. "But the ultimate vote on what happens with the income tax will be the vote that's taken next November," when all 187 members of the General Assembly are up for re-election. With that, anti-tax protesters packing the gallery broke into wild applause.
Mr. Chase spoke after the 151-member House failed to muster the 101 votes, or two-thirds, needed to override Mr. Weicker's veto. The vote, at 6:30 P.M., was 84 to 65 -- a clear majority for repeal but still 17 votes short of what was needed under the State Constitution to override the veto.
For some, the final failure of repeal was a flash point of frustration. Tempers flared and bitterness was evident in many voices in the final minutes of the debate.
"This chamber, this body, this government, this state, looks like garbage in the eyes of the people and rightly so," said Representative Richard Foley Jr., a Republican from Oxford who is also his party's state chairman.
Lawmakers said the special session that began last month to reconsider the tax will probably end its work next week, with an attempt to amend the current income tax to reduce the burden on middle-income residents. Repeal leaders have opposed all so-called repair plans, and the Republican minority leader in the House, Representative Edward C. Krawiecki Jr. of Bristol, said he would move to adjourn the session, perhaps on Monday, if a measure was not ready to go forward.
On Aug. 22, a razor-thin majority in the General Assembly approved a law that imposed a 4.5 percent flat rate tax on adjusted gross income and eliminated Connecticut's status as one of only 10 states with no wage tax. Since then, the state has been rocked by protests that were capped in October by a rally that drew more than 40,000 people to the Capitol grounds.
 
Allusions to New Jersey
 But it has also been clear that the debate has touched deeper chords. Many of the hundreds of people who came to testify against the law last month and early this month in public hearings at the Capitol linked the tax directly to the recession and the downturn of Connecticut's fortunes in the 1990's.
Republicans, who led the repeal drive, have also cast the tax as the issue on which public policy will turn next near. They have alluded repeatedly to New Jersey, where voters turned out a Democratic legislative majority last month in what appeared to be a sort of referendum on taxes.
Public opinion polls have also run consistently against the tax, and one anti-tax lawmaker warned tonight that the minority working to sustain Mr. Weicker's veto was falling victim to a "trap" in which he said Mr. Weicker is also caught: believing that what is right must be unpopular.
 
Late-Breaking News
 "The more people shout at him and tell him it's wrong, the more he's convinced that it's right," said Representative Andrew McCall Norton, a Republican from Colchester, referring to the Governor. "You're going to decide, 'it must be right because I'm flouting the people's will,' " he said of the override vote. "Please don't keep doing it in the future. Very often the people are right."
Lawmakers who favor the tax were mostly muted in the debate, which reached a vote just in time for the end of the 6 P.M. local news programs. Some attacked the alternative budget, which would replace the wage tax with a higher sales tax and deeper spending cuts. But since the numbers of votes were clear well before the final tally, most supporters simply stayed in their seats and let the repealers have their moment.
"We had a difficult decision to make and I think we made it," said Representative Miles S. Rapoport, a Democrat from West Hartford who supports the tax law.
Mr. Weicker also announced separately today that another loose string in the state's budget -- involving concessions demanded by the administration from the state employee unions -- had also been resolved. The preliminary agreement, which covers 13 unions and more than 15,000 state workers, would bring back more 1,100 laid off workers in the next month if approved by rank and file members. Layoff notices for another 700 workers would be rescinded.
The agreements vary, but a spokesman for the unions, Robert Krzys, said the key provision -- announced only a few hours before the vote in the House -- would send all laid-off workers back to their jobs. In return, some employees would give back all or part of pay raises awarded last year. Others would forgo raises that would have otherwise been received. Mr. Weicker told reporters in announcing the agreement that there was no connection between the settlement and the final repeal vote.
In the gallery in the Hall of the House, where zealous anti-income-tax protesters had to be repeatedly warned by House Speaker Richard J. Balducci of New Britain not to disrupt the debate, the mood was one of resignation and quiet determination.
"This is back to 'go' and start all over again," said A. M. Melita, a machinist from Stratford who wore a large sign around his neck proclaiming his allegiance to repeal. "We're going to regroup."

The Economy
A Federal fraud case rippled through Iowa's municipalities and counties, freezing scores of local government funds and prompting the S.E.C. to seek more stringent examinations of the nation's 17,000 investment advisers. [Page 35.] 
 Consumer prices climbed 0.4 percent in November, with what may prove to be temporary surges in food, clothing and energy not fully offset by lower inflation for housing and medical care, the Labor Dept. reported. The rise, which followed a 0.1 percent advance in October, was a bit more than expected. [35.]
Sales of U.S.-built cars and light trucks declined 10.6 percent in early December, auto makers reported. Analysts said the drop suggested that retail demand remained weak at best. [35.]
While merchants are busy blaming the economy for their woes, Stanley Marcus, chairman emeritus of Neiman Marcus, points his accusing finger at the merchant. [35.]
The F.C.C. was "asleep at the switch" in responding to a growing threat of widespread breakdowns in the nation's telephone networks, a Congressional report says. [37.]
Declines in newspaper advertising linage appear to be slowing, but no upturn is yet in sight, a group of newspaper company executives said. [37.]
S.& P. lowered California's credit rating from the highest rating of AAA, citing a huge budget deficit. [8.]
New York City is facing an additional $333 million shortfall in its current budget. [25.]
 
International
The link between Robert Maxwell and Goldman, Sachs has become a focus of investigation by British Government officials amid suggestions that Goldman's actions served to support the share price of Maxwell Communication over many months. [35.]
The British underwriters of Robert Maxwell's life insurance policy said they did not consider the Spanish autopsy report to be the final word. They said they would make no payment on the $36 million policy until they had reasonable proof that Mr. Maxwell had died as a result of an accident. [36.]
 
Companies
Cascade International will seek bankruptcy protection. The retail clothing and fragrance chain's chief executive and majority shareholder, Victor G. Incendy, disappeared last month amid charges of misleading investors. [35.]
Several Federal agencies took action to remove from the market widely used disinfecting agents made by Sporiciden, saying they may pose a risk to public health. [9.]
 
 Markets
Stocks closed higher, cementing a broad two-day rally that more than erased losses earlier in the week. The Dow closed at 2,914.36, up 19.23 for the day and 27.96 for the week. [38.]
Tokyo stocks rose strongly, with the Nikkei jumping 4.8 percent, one of the sharpest one-day rallies in recent years. [39.]
Prices of Treasury notes and bonds moved lower despite a batch of reports that analysts called favorable. [38.]
Grain and soybean futures prices surged as fears of civil war in the Soviet Union receded. [44.]
The dollar advanced against most currencies, helped by concerns about the Soviet Union. Gold prices closed mixed. [44.]
 
 Today's Columns
A court has legitimized a challenge to deductions for certain charitable contributions by a Scientologist, who claimed he was a victim of discrimination. Robert D. Hershey Jr.: Your Taxes. [36.]
Robert W. Kearns, who invented the intermittent windshield wiper, is on the way to becoming a rich man. But he still feels the patents system has failed. Edmund L. Andrews: Patents. [36.]

HEADLINE: Iowa Funds Are Frozen In Inquiry

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Repercussions of a fraud case filed by the Federal Government in Los Angeles rippled through municipalities and counties in Iowa today and were felt here, as well. The funds of scores of local governments were frozen, and the Securities and Exchange Commission was prompted to seek more stringent examinations of the nation's 17,000 investment advisers and higher fees to pay for the reviews.
The problems for Iowa's local governments were touched off when a Federal judge in Los Angeles on Wednesday ordered the $1.2 billion in assets of Institutional Treasury Management Inc. of Irvine, Calif., frozen. 
 The S.E.C. said that at least $74.4 million held by the company for its clients had disappeared. The funds, the agency said, had been improperly used to cover losses from unauthorized bond trades.
The court also froze the assets of the company's owner, Steven D. Wymer, who resigned this week. Through his lawyer, Mr. Wymer has offered to settle the case without admitting or denying guilt.
 
Hearing Next Week
 Other clients of the fund include various government funds from 12 states and Micronesia, but most of the losses uncovered so far involve the Iowa Trust, a pool of assets from municipalities in the state that stand to lose more than $70 million. A hearing is scheduled for next Friday for a judge to determine which of the advisory firm's accounts can be unfrozen.
The order freezing the company's assets threw into question the finances of the many towns and municipalities that invested money with the company to obtain the higher yields it advertised, but as a result of the case are now struggling to meet their payrolls and other expenses. Eighty-seven governments and pension plans in Iowa invested in the fund.
Lori A. Richards, a senior official in the S.E.C.'s Los Angeles office, said the commission felt compelled to freeze all of the company's assets because it was not entirely clear how pervasive the suspected fraud was. "It's possible that most of the funds will be recovered," she said. "It's also possible they might not."
In Iowa, Richard Vohs, a spokesman for Gov. Terry Brandstad, said that so far the state had been called upon to help only the Waterloo office of the state's Department of Correctional Services to meet its payroll. But other institutions were concerned that they could lose substantial sums. The largest investor was the police pension fund of Dubuque County, which gave Institutional Treasury Management $24 million in invest.
"Their interest rates were a little higher but not outlandish, so we didn't think it was too good to be true," said Wes A. Nelson, city finance director for Marion, Iowa, a town of 20,000 not far from Cedar Rapids that invested $4.3 million. He said that since most of the assets invested had been for construction and equipment, the lawsuit would not cause an immediate cash squeeze.
In an interview today, Richard C. Breeden, the chairman of the S.E.C., said the case highlighted the government supervision of an industry that manages more than $5 trillion.
"Regular examinings on average are only done once every 8 to 10 years," he said.
S.E.C. officials said that Institutional Treasury made hundreds of unauthorized trades, and that when those trades lost money, they moved funds from other accounts to make up the difference. The company and Mr. Wymer were also accused of taking Treasury securities worth $65 million from an Iowa fund without paying for them and using the proceeds for other clients' accounts.
In addition to the S.E.C., officials at the United States Attorney's offices in Iowa and Los Angeles are investigating the case, as is the Iowa State Attorney General's office. Investments also came from California, Colorado, Florida, Illinois, Minnesota, Nevada, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming.
Michael Perlis, a lawyer representing Mr. Wymer, said his client would consent to a standard agreement with the S.E.C. of an injunction barring him from the industry. "It would leave open issues such as penalties," he said.
Regardless of the outcome of the case, it is expected to have a profound impact on the nation's 17,000 registered investment advisers, many of whom are financial planners. Mr. Breeden said today that the investment advisers could expect tighter supervision and higher examination fees.
They now pay the S.E.C. a one-time fee of $150 to be registered. Mr. Breeden said he would ask Congress to adopt a new law that would assess annual fees related to the size of the funds they had under management.
He said that he had not decided how much to seek, but that the commission intended to raise "millions of dollars."
"It would provide the resources for more meaningful and frequent oversight," he said.
Mutual funds and stockbrokers and dealers now pay annual fees that provide the money needed to cover the costs of examining them. The funds pay fees based on their sales, while the brokers and dealers pay an amount fixed by a formula applied to the value of their trades.
Mr. Breeden also said existing rules permitted virtually anyone who had not been convicted of a Federal crime involving financial wrongdoing to obtain a license from the S.E.C. to be an investment adviser.
"Murder for money would probably bar a person," said Marianne K. Smythe, director of the S.E.C.'s investment management division. "Murder for love probably would not." Indeed, Ms. Smythe said that a few years ago a felon actually applied from prison for a license to be an investment adviser and dropped the application only after the agency tied it up in red tape.
"We felt it might not be appropriate," she said. "But nothing in the law technically precluded him from getting a license."

HEADLINE: SOVIET DASARRAY;
Hurdles, Big and Small, for Baker's Trip

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
As Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d prepares to set off for Moscow, Administration officials acknowledge that even their modest plans for helping to prevent disorder in the crumbling Soviet Union face formidable obstacles -- not the least of which could be finding fuel to power Mr. Baker's plane on his tour of Soviet republics.
Mr. Baker leaves on Saturday for Russia, Ukraine, Kirghizia, Byelorussia and Kazakhstan. The State Department spokeswoman, Margaret D. Tutwiler, said that despite reports of airport closings throughout the Soviet Union because of fuel shortages, the five republics that Mr. Baker will visit have all assured him that they will have jet fuel on hand for his Air Force 707, as well as gasoline for his motorcade. If that does not turn out to be the case, Miss Tutwiler said, the State Department has contingency plans. 
 Speaking to reporters at a White House briefing, Mr. Baker said the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, had spoken earlier by telephone with President Bush for 25 minutes. Mr. Yeltsin told Mr. Bush about how other republics were joining the new commonwealth. Mr. Bush later telephoned President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to get his assessment of the situation. They spoke for half an hour.
 
Keeping Neutral Policy
 Despite the gathering momentum for the new commonwealth, Mr. Baker stressed again that "we cannot and we must not inject ourselves into this purely political process" -- meaning that the United States will not recognize this new commonwealth, or drop its support for the rump central Government of Mr. Gorbachev, until there is a decisive conclusion to the power struggle there.
Officials say Mr. Baker will be approaching the Soviets on the nuclear question with plans for best- and worst-case scenarios. The best-case scenario is that the republics, the army command and whatever new commonwealth emerges will be able to maintain a unified, single command for nuclear weapons and supervise the destruction of whatever nuclear missiles are in republics, which say they eventually want to be nuclear free.
Administration officials say that at the moment, the degree of coordination between the commonwealth republics and the army on the nuclear issue is much higher than appears in public, and that explains why Mr. Baker and Mr. Bush for the moment say they are not alarmed.
"What we have been hearing from the republics is 'Just tell us what to do, and we'll do it,' " a senior Administration official said.
 
Offering Technical Aid
 Mr. Baker said in his speech on Thursday that the Administration would offer the Soviets $400 million appropriated by Congress to help them destroy their 27,000 nuclear weapons. Assuming that the army and republics can work together in a reasonably efficient manner on this effort, much of what Mr. Baker will be offering is technical expertise to help transfer missiles to central depots and tag and destroy weapons, as well as advice to each republic on its legal obligations under the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and conventional arms reduction treaty.
American officials say most of the republic leaders have no idea what their treaty obligations are for missiles and manpower on their soil, because all of this was handled by the central authorities.
The worst-case scenario is that the Soviet army will now disintegrate in tandem with the central Government. And if that happens, it is not at all clear that the various republic leaders in Ukraine, Byelorussia and Kazakhstan, who say they want to be nuclear-free zones one day, will have full control over the nuclear weapons on their soil or coastlines.
Soviet nuclear weapons are distributed among different subgroups in the Soviet military. The navy controls sea-based forces; the Strategic Rocket Force controls intercontinental ballistic missiles, and mobile, short-range missiles, nuclear land-mines and nuclear artillery are distributed among operational commands. How these subgroups, once under a central army command, will now relate to the respective republic leaders is simply still not clear.
 
Four-Step Process
 In such a situation, Washington would most likely try to carry out a plan that tracks closely with a proposal made to the Administration two weeks ago by Ash Carter and other members of the Center for Science and International Affairs at Harvard University.
It would work in four stages. First, with American help, the various republics would inventory and tag the nuclear weapons on their soil to keep track of what is there. Second, the weapons would all be pulled together in a central storage depot, so they would be out of the hands of individual units and commanders, who, if hungry or desperate enough might want to use them for blackmail. Third, a program would have to be carried out to neutralize the warheads, a relatively easy process, since they are so electronically sophisticated that the smallest change can render them useless.
Finally, the fissionable material in each of the warheads, material that remains usable for thousands of years, has to be removed and stored in a secure area that would be regularly monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency. What may turn out to be an even bigger problem, though, American officials say, is how to keep unemployed Soviet nuclear scientists and engineers from selling their expertise abroad.
 
Obstacle to Food Aid
 Regarding humanitarian aid, the biggest problem facing American officials is setting up a monitoring system to insure that food gets to its intended destinations and that not too much is siphoned off by local mafias or ends up in the the Russian republic, where it can be used to dominate other republics.
On economic aid, Mr. Baker's main problem is that no one in the West really knows where bottom is yet in terms of devolution of the former Soviet Union. Will it stop at the republic level or will some republics now start to fragment? Much of Mr. Baker's discussion with republic leaders in this area will be to assess how to get Western experts, who have operated farms and businesses, into each republic, where they can begin to help change business practices and mindsets and improve the distribution system.

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales Off Again, Falling 10.6%

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT, Special to The New York Times

 BODY:
DETROIT, Dec. 13 --
Sales of domestically built cars and light trucks declined 10.6 percent in early December, the auto makers reported today. Analysts said the drop suggested that retail demand for vehicles remained weak at best.
"There is certainly no evidence of any improvement here," said Harvey Heinbach, automotive analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York. He said the figures, while low, followed a pattern in recent months in which the first 10-day sales period of the month was significantly lower than the following two periods. He attributed the discrepancy to certain estimates used to calculate sales rates. Therefore, "there may not be a new round of further deterioration," he said. 
 Tom Webb, chief economist of the National Automobile Dealers Association, said he was disappointed by the seasonally adjusted annual selling rate -- 5.4 million, compared with 6.5 million a year earlier. But he added that he did not think the number pointed to a further weakening. Indeed, the selling rate over the last 30 days was 5.9 million, down only slightly from the October rate of 6 million and the November rate of 6.1 million.
 Several dealers said sales remained slow, and they said negative reports about the economy had resulted in low consumer confidence. "There's a lot of talk of layoffs here," said Dayton Andrews, owner of a Chrysler-Plymouth dealership in Clearwater, Fla.
For the year, Mr. Andrews's sales are 20 percent below the 1990 level, but in early December they were off 40 percent from the equivalent period of last year.
Other dealers said they sensed that many drivers were planning to wait until spring to buy new cars. "With the economy the way it is, people are just trying to patch up the cars the best they can to get through the winter," said George LePage, sales manager of Houser Mitsubishi in Springfield, Mass.
 
 
Car Sales Drop 14.5%
 For the Dec. 1-11 period, which had eight selling days both this year and last, the domestic manufacturers sold 117,190 cars, a decrease of 14.5 percent. Sales of light trucks dropped 4.2 percent, to 80,428 pickups, mini-vans and sport-utility vehicles. All vehicles built in the United States, Canada and Mexico are considered domestically built.
The General Motors Corporation sold 61,821 cars in early December, a decline of 5.7 percent from a year earlier. Two G.M. divisions posted gains in car sales in the period: Buick, on the strength of its redesigned LeSabre, and Cadillac, because of the strength of its DeVille and new Seville. G.M. sold 31,215 light trucks in the period, a decline of 7.7 percent.
The Ford Motor Company posted a 32.9 percent drop in car sales, to 27,676. A company spokesman attributed the sharp decline to a particularly strong period last year, just before Ford discontinued rebates. Ford's light-truck sales declined 14.3 percent, to 28,998.
The Chrysler Corporation's car sales dropped 30.3 percent, to 12,500, based on estimates by Ward's Automotive Reports. Chrysler does not report 10-day sales figures. Ward's estimated that Chrysler's light-truck sales, including mini-vans and Jeeps, rose 24.4 percent, to 17,800.
The Honda Motor Company sold 6,665 domestically produced cars in early December, a gain of 74.4 percent over the period a year earlier. But Honda executives said last year's figures were particularly soft because a special incentive expired at the end of November. The Toyota Motor Corporation sold 4,858 cars built in North America in the period, an increase of 5 percent.

HEADLINE: Mexico's Chief and Bush to Talk Trade

BYLINE: By TIM GOLDEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 13

 BODY:
When President Carlos Salinas de Gortari arrives in Maryland on Saturday to meet with President Bush at Camp David, he may well have Pennsylvania on his mind.
It was about the time of Harris Wofford's victory in the United States Senate election there last month that Mr. Salinas's overarching goal -- a North American Free Trade Agreement -- became an uncertainty for next year. 
 In his campaign, Mr. Wofford criticized the trade negotiation as evidence that Mr. Bush cared more about foreign relations than American jobs. And in the weeks since, the optimism of Mexican officials has been almost visibly chipped away as American politicians and political analysts have suggested that Mr. Bush might or should delay the accord to keep it from becoming an issue in the 1992 presidential campaign.
Despite the Bush Administration's continuing assurances that politics will not dictate the schedule for a trade agreement, Mexican officials have taken a series of steps to prepare for the eventuality that a trade pact will not be concluded next year.
 
Draft Texts Exchanged
 And Mexican officials said that while Mr. Salinas would go to Camp David principally to seek Mr. Bush's thoughts on the timing of a treaty, he did not expect a final answer.
"Given how the negotiations have progressed, we could have a treaty next year," a senior aide to Mr. Salinas said. "But we will only be able to see in the beginning of the year whether the Free Trade Agreement becomes an issue in the campaign."
In interviews, United States, Mexican and Canadian officials said the negotiations to dismantle trade barriers could be wrapped up by late spring. By this week, the three sides will have exchanged at least some draft texts in nearly all of the 18 working groups that have been negotiating behind closed doors for the last six months.
Draft language has still not been presented on some of the most difficult and complex subjects, including the terms of a regional automotive trade and the elimination of tariff barriers in agriculture. But such issues might end up seeming rather straightforward by comparison to the political process that a final text might have to survive.
 
Fast-Track Proceedures
 With Mr. Salinas's power at a peak and public support for free trade considered widespread, Mexico's approval of a treaty is a given. In Canada, Prime Minister Brian Mulroney has sought to avoid a full-scale public debate on the extension of the United States-Canada free trade umbrella to include Mexico. Some analysts have said that he should be able to keep the talks from becoming a difficult political issue as long as a treaty is concluded before he has to call elections in 1993. But that would depend on Mr. Bush.
Under the so-called fast-track procedures which allow Mr. Bush to submit a treaty to Congress for a yes-or-no vote, the Administration would probably have to conclude a treaty by February to insure its movement through Congress before the political conventions, American officials said.
If the Congressional opposition to a final treaty proved limited, the legislative calendar could be shortened. And despite opposition to a trade pact by organized labor, some environmentalists and some Congressional Democrats, it remains far from clear that a treaty debate would necessarily hurt Mr. Bush's chances for re-election. Some political analysts have argued that Mr. Wofford's stance on trade was not an important reason for his victory.
Nonetheless, Mexican officials said that even a strong public commitment by Mr. Bush to move the negotiations forward quickly would be no guarantee that he would send a treaty to Congress next year. At least as important, they said, would be the performance of the American economy in the first months of the year and the outcome of early Presidential primaries.
 
Delaying a Pact
 Mr. Salinas, a foreign diplomat said, "will probably get a public commitment and then come back and declare victory and the rumors will start all over again."
Economists and Mexican officials consider a free-trade agreement a necessity for the success of Mr. Salinas's economic strategy. But they say that the foreign investment that will reach $14 billion this year could continue flowing into Mexico even if an agreement is delayed -- as long as the United States convinces investors that it has simply been delayed.
Mexico's annual budget, announced last month, set a target of single-digit inflation, a goal that none of Latin America's big debtor nations has been able to sustain recently. Public spending will rise only slightly, despite a reduction in Mexico's debt service. The Goverment also hopes to slow the growth of its current-account deficit. But economists say that will largely depend on how short-term investors in Mexican stocks perceive the future of free trade.

HEADLINE: Warming Up for the Primary Primary

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANCHESTER, N.H., Dec. 13

 BODY:
New Hampshire is the grim winnower of Presidential politics, its first-in-the-nation primary making some candidates and breaking others, slapping down Presidents and creating instant stars.
On Feb. 18, 1992, New Hampshire voters will have the chance to exercise that power with a vengeance on a fresh and vulnerable Democratic field, and on a nervous President faced with a "send 'em a message" challenger. 
 For President Bush, the primary will be the first test against the conservative commentator Patrick J. Buchanan. And it comes in a state where Mr. Bush could hardly be more vulnerable on the economy, where the unemployment rate has risen from 2.3 percent in October 1988 to 6.6 percent last October, and where bankruptcies have soared. As a result, Republicans here are warning the White House that Mr. Buchanan must be taken seriously.
"The President is going to have to do some vigorous campaigning up here, and I have told him this," said the state's Senator, Warren B. Rudman, who was at a hastily scheduled opening of the Bush campaign headquarters here Thursday night.
And with the Iowa caucuses discounted this campaign season by the presence of Senator Tom Harkin, a favorite son, New Hampshire becomes the first test of a Democratic field that is still largely unknown and so strapped financially that a poor showing here could be lethal for several of these candidates, party strategists say. And if Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York enters the race next week, this state's voters will have the opportunity either to affirm his front-runner's reputation, or to leave him a victim of the expectations game.
Analysts in both parties agree that the economy will drive this primary in unpredictable ways. Raymond Buckley, a Democratic State Representative who knocked on 3,000 doors this year in his successful campaign for alderman in Manchester, said: "If there's one word to describe people, it's 'fear.' People are scared to death. They're afraid they can't pay their property taxes. They're afraid they'll lose their homes. They're afraid they'll lose their jobs. This is not the New Hampshire I was born and brought up in."
Gov. Judd Gregg, who is heading Mr. Bush's campaign in the state, said: "People are frustrated, upset. I call it the X-factor." The danger, he said, is that voters may see the Republican primary as a chance to send a message to Mr. Bush, even though they plan to vote for him the following November.
 
The Tsongas Factor
 There are many X-factors in the Democratic primary. As Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska put it, "It's still a jump ball."
A poll last week in The Boston Globe showed that former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts was ahead of the pack in New Hampshire. But some Democrats say that is largely a reflection of name recognition stemming from his residence in an adjoining state and his six-month jump in organizing. "The field is clouded right now, and Tsongas to a certain extent is the only one with definition," said Mitchell Schwartz, the New Hampshire director for Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas.
Still, Mr. Tsongas has become something of a wild card for the other campaigns, with no one quite sure how solid voters' support is for a candidate widely considered to be one of the longer shots in the race.
In general, the Democratic race is unformed: the Globe poll, which had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 5 percentage points, found that half of the likely Democratic primary voters were uncommitted and that many others seemed open to changing their minds.
In terms of organizing, Senator Harkin got an earlier start than most of his rivals, but Mr. Kerrey and Mr. Clinton have moved quickly this fall, Democrats say. Mr. Kerrey, while still trying to hone his message and performance on the campaign trail, has picked up much of the political network that had formed around former Senator Gary Hart in 1984, a group that is still considered formidable.
The other declared Democratic Presidential contenders are Edmund G. Brown Jr., the former Governor of California, and L. Douglas Wilder, the Governor of Virginia.
 
Rumors on Cuomo
 The undeclared is Mr. Cuomo, who is finally approaching a deadline: the Dec. 20 filing cutoff for the New Hampshire primary. His advisers have been calling political organizers here for logistical advice, and each day brings a fresh -- and to some Democrats, wearisome -- round of rumors.
Some Democrats here say that Mr. Cuomo has missed a valuable month, that if he had entered the race in November he could have wrapped up an enormous amount of support and stopped some of his rivals in their tracks. Still, Mr. Cuomo's admirers here say his message will resonate in this ailing state. And Joseph Grandmaison, the former state Democratic chairman here, said Mr. Cuomo has one very large advantage over his rivals.
"The biggest difference between the Cuomo candidacy and any of the others is these other people have had the terrible burden of introducing themselves and their candidacy," Mr. Grandmaison said.
The declared Democratic contenders, meanwhile, are plugging away with the kind of politics this state expects. At a high school in Milford this week, Mr. Kerrey took question after question from an earnest collection of students, including one young woman who demanded, "Do you have any plans to reduce the blatant patriarchy of the U.S. Government?"
 
Cheers for Buchanan
 On the Republican side, Mr. Buchanan followed the formal announcement of his candidacy this week with a high-profile campaign swing in the state, cheered on just about every day by The Union Leader, the influential Manchester newspaper. The Union Leader's publisher, Nackey Loeb, noted two announcements this week of major new Federal benefits for the state and suggested that Mr. Buchanan's candidacy was already paying off for New Hampshire.
"Call it coincidence, if you will, but Washington is suddenly bestowing financial benefits on our beleaguered state," she wrote.
Meanwhile, the Bush campaign came to town this week to open a campaign headquarters in downtown Manchester. Robert M. Teeter, Mr. Bush's chief political strategist, declared that "we are committed to a very aggressive, well-organized campaign" in the state.
At a news conference with Governor Gregg, Mr. Teeter was asked if Mr. Bush's economic proposals would include more Federal spending for New Hampshire. The Governor interjected, "I certainly hope so."

HEADLINE: Newspaper Outlook Still Dim

BYLINE: By JOHN HOLUSHA

 BODY:
Declines in newspaper advertising linage appear to be slowing, but no upturn is yet in sight, a group of newspaper company executives said yesterday.
Executives of The New York Times Company, the Chicago-based Tribune Company and the Washington Post Company who spoke yesterday echoed the presentations that others had made at a weeklong conference sponsored by the brokerage firm Paine Webber: 1991 will prove to be a poor year for revenues and earnings, and the outlook for next year is largely dependent on an economic recovery. 
 Walter E. Mattson, president and chief operating officer of the Times Company, said he expected that the company would be able to open its new printing plant in Edison, N.J., with reduced staffing because other unions would follow the example set Wednesday by the drivers' union and reach agreements with the company.
"The plate makers, paper handlers, machinists and electricians are likely to come behind the drivers," Mr. Mattson said.
Mr. Mattson said he expected that the pressmen would settle as well, and that the agreement would lead to reductions in staff levels at the company's plant in Manhattan.
 
Outlook for Ads
 David L. Gorham, chief financial officer of the Times Company, said the outlook for advertising next year in The New York Times newspaper was for an 8 percent decline from 1991. He said company executives expected "flattening out in 1993 before turning up modestly in 1994."
He said the regional newspapers were expecting "a further slight drop" in advertising volume next year, followed by slow growth in 1993. Mr. Gorham said regional advertising was not expected to reach 1991 levels until 1994.
Executives of the company's magazine group said initial indications of 1992 advertising appeared stronger, but cautioned that the indications might not turn into actual pages if the economy remained weak.
Charles T. Brumback, president of the Tribune Company, termed 1991 disappointing because of an "unexpectedly long economic slump." He said the company's earnings would be under $2 a share, compared with the peak of $3 a share in 1989.
He said the collapse of the Maxwell publishing empire and the bankruptcy filing in New York by The Daily News, which is owned by Maxwell interests, were not likely to have an impact on the Tribune Company. The company sold the tabloid to Robert Maxwell after a bitter strike, but had taken charges to cover any contingencies.
He said next year's outlook was for "at best, sluggish economic growth" because of high unemployment and low consumer confidence.
 
Ad Decline Is Slowing
 John W. Madigan, head of the company's newspaper operations, said the rate of decline in advertising linage had slowed in the fourth quarter. He said the company was estimating that newspaper revenues would grow 6 percent next year, at least partly because of new ventures.
Donald E. Graham, president of the Washington Post Company, said, "This has been a terrible year, at least from the financial point of view." He said earnings for 1991 would come in "well behind" 1990, when the company earned $14.45 a share. He said the 1991 earnings would include a one-time charge of $4.50 a share to account for the cost of health care for retired employees.
Mr. Graham said the outlook for 1992 would be soft unless there was some significant upturn in the economy. He said the company's newsprint operations would continue to be a drain as excess capacity and depressed demand held down prices.
Advertising at The Washington Post is still declining, particularly in the real estate, display and help-wanted categories, Mr. Graham reported. "We are not looking for any major improvements at The Post until the economy begins to pick up -- and that may be a while," he said.
Revenue at the company's broadcast stations fell 10 percent in the first three quarters, Alan G. Spoon, an executive vice president, said. He noted that Newsweek magazine, which the company owns, would be the first major magazine to use selective binding, a technology that produces customized editions, as a way to raise circulation revenue.
Subscribers will be offered special added sections on foreign affairs, financial advice, technology and books at a cost of $5 a year for each section. With advertising in decline, magazines have been seeking to use new printing technologies to improve circulation revenues.

HEADLINE: Hard Day for a Willing Shopper

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
While merchants are busy blaming the economy for their woes, Stanley Marcus points his accusing finger at them.
During a recent stroll through some of New York City's finest stores, Mr. Marcus -- who as chairman of Neiman Marcus turned extravagance into necessity -- uncovered thin inventories, listless salespeople and a numbing lack of innovation, glitz or pizazz. 
 "If there is a plot to go out and kill Santy Claus, retailers have succeeded in putting together the right poisons," said Mr. Marcus, a bearded gentleman who looks a little like Santa Claus himself.
Most shoppers, like him, already have all the obvious necessities, Mr. Marcus said, and will buy anything else only if it is presented to them. "I already own more than any human being needs," he said. "Other than things like toothpaste, I don't buy anything that isn't sold to me."
 
Products, but No Pitch
 And as he traipsed around Manhattan's elegant midtown shopping district, hardly anyone tried to sell him anything.
At Neiman Marcus, Mr. Marcus, the retailer's 86-year-old chairman emeritus and the son of a founder, discovered that the right sales approach could even persuade customers to buy his-and-hers mummy cases. Since he retired from an active role in Neiman Marcus he has developed a consulting business.
The holiday sales season is when retailers make as much as 50 percent of their sales and an even greater share of their profits. On a visit to New York from Dallas, his hometown, Mr. Marcus found merchandise stocks too narrow, with the same goods for sale in store after store. The volume of advertising and promotions was too high, he asserted, and the level of service was too low.
Mr. Marcus's targets were not the cash-and-carry, beat-any-advertised-price sort of places. His perambulations along Fifth, Madison and Park Avenues and the side streets that link them took him to several of the city's most fabled retailers, questing after the perfect cashmere cardigan for his wife.
He left the Chanel boutique on East 57th Street after he had stood in the shop for several minutes and failed to attract the attention of anyone working there. A saleswoman in Galeries Lafayette across the street told him she didn't think the store had any classic cashmere cardigans and failed to suggest an alternative. And at Bergdorf Goodman, a saleswoman told Mr. Marcus that there were no cashmere cardigans in her department, neglecting to mention the table stacked with sweaters just around the corner.
Eventually, Mr. Marcus wandered into A. Sulka & Company, the tony men's haberdashery on Park Avenue. He recounted that a salesman came over and asked if Mr. Marcus needed help.
Well, yes, Mr. Marcus related, asking if they carried any women's clothing.
"No," the salesman was said to reply, "but what are you looking for?"
"A cashmere cardigan for my wife," Mr. Marcus told him.
"You know," Mr. Marcus recalled the salesman as saying, "many women buy our cardigans because they're roomier, and the only difference is they button from right to left instead of left to right. Let me show you a few."
As Mr. Marcus said later, "That man made a sale."
Mr. Marcus said that his experience in New York recalls his experiment in 1988, when he decided to make major purchases only if he found salespeople to attend him satisfactorily. A car salesman failed to suggest that he take a test drive, a clerk in a luggage store was too engrossed in a telephone call to help him and a jeweler was unable to give him a good reason to buy a watch. He estimated his savings at $48,732.
Improving service enough for customers to notice is no snap, Mr. Marcus said. At Neiman Marcus, he prodded salespeople to keep records of customers' preferences and sizes, their birthdays and their anniversaries -- services that many other stores have adopted.
"Everybody talks about store service these days like it's something you can run out and buy and rub it on your elbow and suddenly, you've got service," he said. "When I tell them it takes at least three years and lots of money to get a good service program established, they look at me like I'm crazy."
 
 
Rewards for Good Service
 Service is not simply a matter of providing a variety of payment options or staging frequent sales, Mr. Marcus explained. Good service, he said, must be inculcated by top executives who continually educate, re-educate and reward even the lowliest sales clerk for imagination and flair.
"Customers can come up with more problems than the bright people who wrote your operating procedures can foresee," Mr. Marcus said. "You have to empower your sales staff to use their judgment and go beyond the standards set down on paper and by the computer."
While the computer is a powerful tool for supervising a retail business, Mr. Marcus said, merchants are relying too much on computer tapes and too little on their eyes to tell them what to stock. He said retailers had reacted to the sins of two Christmases past, when an overabundance of goods forced sweeping markdowns, by ordering too few goods for this Christmas.
 
 
'Picked Over Already'
 By maintaining such lean inventories, stores will sell out of hot items and miss the opportunity to keep selling them later in the season. In the meantime, less popular items will have to be marked down anyway.
"The stocks I've seen are lousy, picked over already," he said disapprovingly. "The stores have got a bunch of odds and ends from early in the season, so they're handicapped in the final days of the season when they could make the most sales."
Mr. Marcus attributed the unsold holiday inventories of past years to sameness, not slack overall demand. Stores that once distinguished themselves by the exclusive merchandise they carried now stock the same goods as their competitors.
"Seeing so much of the same thing suppresses the desire to buy," he said. "You can only own one red Liz Claiborne blazer."
Mr. Marcus contends that this sameness among retailers is a result of overproduction by a few major manufacturers of clothing and other goods. Too many of the same goods are chasing too few dollars, which in turn leads to promotions.
 
 
Continuous Price Cutting
 This abundance of goods has forced retailers to slash prices continuously rather than periodically, a practice that has made consumers suspicious of original prices, Mr. Marcus said. The result is a worrisome erosion of profit margins and a reluctance among consumers to make purchases at any price.
"People aren't buying because they feel they're going to be suckered when the retailer knocks the price down on a coat three days after they bought it," Mr. Marcus said. "How do you fix that perception?"
At this, even Mr. Marcus paused, then admitted, "Well, I'm afraid that's a problem I don't have an answer to."

HEADLINE: U.N. Urges Nations to Begin Restoring Ties to South Africa

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 13

 BODY:
The General Assembly called unanimously today on all nations to start restoring sports, cultural, scientific and academic ties with South Africa in recognition of the progress it has made toward abolishing apartheid.
The Assembly also said that nations should prepare to phase out remaining economic and other sanctions against South Africa as the country moves toward a democratic non-racial system. 
 The Assembly vote comes a week before the opening of a major political conference in South Africa, that will bring together the white-minority Government, the African National Congress and other political parties in an attempt to lay the groundwork for majority rule.
South Africa's Foreign Minister, Roelof F. Botha, welcomed the vote today, saying it showed that "sanctions are crumbling" despite the General Assembly's continued "short-sightedness on financial and trade sanctions." It is essential, he continued, that the Assembly "support economic growth rather than inhibiting it."
 
Heeding Mandela's Suggestions
 Nonetheless, he said that the Assembly, in the South African resolutions it adopted this year, had recognized several important new political steps taken by his Government.
These, he said, included the signing in September of the National Peace Accord, which is intended to end ethnic violence in the country; South Africa's accession to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, and its agreement with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees to allowing political exiles to return to South Africa.
The resolution on relaxing sanctions roughly followed suggestions made in a General Assembly speech earlier this month by Nelson A. Mandela, leader of the African National Congress. Mr. Mandela said "people-to-people sanctions" were already being phased out, as the Commonwealth countries had agreed at a meeting of heads of state and government in October.
South Africa was admitted to the International Olympic Committee last summer, and the Association of Tennis Professionals doubles championships were held in South Africa in November.
But Mr. Mandela said remaining economic sanctions should be lifted only when the Government agrees to hand over power to an interim administration and convene an assembly to draft a new constitution. He said oil and arms embargoes should remain in force until a new democratically elected government has taken power.
In fact, The United States, the European Community and Japan have already lifted most significant restrictions on trade with South Africa.

NEW YORK CITY
 
ASSEMBLY SPEAKER GUILTY OF FRAUD 
 The Speaker of the State Assembly, Mel Miller, was convicted of Federal fraud charges in Brooklyn, shattering his career as one of the most powerful politicians in New York. The verdict, convicting Mr. Miller of 8 of the 19 felony charges against him, means that he is automatically expelled from the Assembly and could be imprisoned and disbarred. The conviction threw the state's already chaotic budget negotiations into deeper disarray and raised serious new questions about whether Governor Cuomo will be able to run for President. Pages 1 and 27.
 
ALL ROADS LEAD TO . . .
Rush-hour crowding may be common in the city's subways, but nothing quite matches the crush at Roosevelt Avenue, the busiest station on the busiest line. About 3.5 million people ride the subway daily, and some mornings it feels as if they all pass through Jackson Heights. Crowding is so severe that, when the E and F trains stop running because of mechanical problems or other difficulties, the conductors sometimes have to close off stairs to the platform. Otherwise, the area could get so overcrowded that passengers might fall to the tracks. Page 1.
 
QUEENS DEVELOPMENT STALLED
A long-stalled effort to build a "new town" on a vast ocean-front site in Queens has been stalled again because the poor economy has forced the developer to withdraw. Now city officials say they will try to develop the area, called Arverne, as discrete smaller projects with separate developers. Page 29.
 
NOW YOU HAVE IT . . .
It was a lot of money, but it wasn't theirs for long. Four men robbed an armored car delivering money to a bank of $800,000 but left the money in a getaway car when they crashed while being chased, the police said. Page 26.
 
REGION
 
TWO VIEWS OF A MAYOR
As his fraud trial closed, Mayor Gerald McCann of Jersey City heard his lawyer call him a "visionary" and a "dreamer" who just wanted to be a successful developer. And he heard the prosecutor say he had no objections to Mr. McCann's dreams as long as he didn't pay for them with other people's money. Page 28.
 
CONVICTION IN TROOPER KILLING
Richard Williams, a former member of a violent revolutionary group, was convicted of killing Philip Lamonaco, a state trooper who was shot to death in Warren County 10 years ago. Page 28.
 
TELL IT TO CONGRESS
As a chill rain soaked the bare trees and a "House for Sale" sign outside, 11 people sat around a living room in middle-class Hamden, Conn., and told two members of Congress what the faltering economy had done to their once-satisfying lives. Page 28.
 
TAX REPEAL FAILS IN HARTFORD
Governor Weicker vetoed a plan to repeal Connecticut's new income tax only 30 minutes after it was approved by the House, asserting that the legislature had embarked on a path of "full-scale surrender to fiscal gimmicks and political fantasies." Although neither the veto nor a subsequent failure to override it came as any great surprise, the day's events nonetheless stand out as important landmarks in the 10 months of conflict and passion that have surrounded the tax debate.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 19.23 to Close at 2,914.36

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON Jr.

 BODY:
Stocks closed higher yesterday, cementing a broad two-day rally that more than erased losses earlier in the week. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 2,914.36, up 19.23 points for the day and 27.96 for the week.
The Dow rose sharply at the opening and remained above 2,900 for the rest of the day. Advancing issues almost doubled losing ones, 1,090 to 563, and volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy at 201.5 million shares. 
 The market responded to gains overseas -- Japan's Nikkei stock index rose nearly 5 percent and European markets were also strong -- and to encouraging news about the November Consumer Price Index, said Robert Wallberg, an equity analyst at MMS International.
"It's also based on the fact that we were technically oversold," Mr. Wallberg added, referring to the Dow's bounce back from the 2,850 level, which is about as low as the average has gone this year.
"I think the test of 2,850 was meaningful," said Gene J. Seagle, director of technical research at Gruntal & Company. "This is more than just a temporary movement. I think this upside momentum will build as the market develops into a year-end rally."
Transportation stocks did well, Mr. Seagle noted, as did many blue-chip issues, as the broad gain affected most sectors of the market.
The Nasdaq composite index rose 4.88 points, to 540.90, and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was up 2.92, to 384.47. The Russell 2,000-stock index was also up, rising 1.72, to 177.51, and the American Stock Exchange index rose 3.35, to 369.48. The New York Stock Exchange composite index went up 1.46, to 211.90.
Among gaining stocks, Employee Benefit Plan, a medical management and service corporation, rose 3 3/4, to 41.
Among losers, Wells Fargo dropped 5 1/2, to 55, after an announcement on Thursday that the bank would set aside $700 million for loan losses, reflecting the depressed real estate market in California. The drop followed Wells Fargo's rise of 3 1/4 immediately after the announcement.
"It's like I.B.M.," said Mr. Walberg, noting that optimistic descriptions of the computer giant's restructuring plans led to a rise in stock price on the day of the announcement. But the stock fell sharply in subsequent days, once the plan had been studied more thoroughly.
Wells Fargo also reported that it would cut its dividend in half to 50 cents a share, and analysts lowered long- and short-term ratings for the bank.
BankAmerica, one of Wells Fargo's competitors. rose 1 1/2 points, to 35.
Elsewhere in the market, Lincoln Financial went up 3, to 24, after the company reported that it had hired Goldman, Sachs to help it examine possible sale of the bank holding company and other options.
The bank reported a loss of $6 million in the first nine months of this year, and last week deferred a decision on giving a fourth-quarter dividend.
Atmel dropped 1 3/4, to 7, after fourth- quarter profits were reported to be modest because of continued softness in the computer industry and the slow economy.

HEADLINE: Zairian Prime Minister Is Certain U.S. Wants Change in His Nation

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
The Prime Minister of Zaire, Nguza Karl-i-Bond, ended a visit here today, saying he was convinced that the United States wants major political changes in the Central African nation that has been ruled for more than a quarter-century by President Mobutu Sese Seko.
Mr. Nguza, a major Zairian diplomat and political figure off and on over the last two decades, said President Mobutu is aware that he cannot expect to cling to power much longer without the support of outside forces. 
 "He knows he is now at the end," Mr. Nguza said. "He knows that all his friends in the West want him to step down."
In an interview, Mr. Nguza, who became Prime Minister in November, the third in three months, said that after months of political and economic chaos, the President fears only two things: "bullets and being brought to court."
The Prime Minister has had a long, troubled relationship with the President. He served in his Cabinet and as an Ambassador, but also became the object of the Zairian leader's wrath, and was for a time under death sentence. He was incarcerated in President Mobutu's prisons. He acknowledges that friends often say his career "has gone like a yo-yo."
Now, he says, the President knows him well.
"He knows I am not going to harm him," he said. "He knows I would allow him to go in dignity."
The President is widely known for his lavish style of living and for corruption in his Government. Mr. Nguza said the President is apprehensive about being forced into exile.
"He knows what happened to the Shah," the Prime Minister said. "He knows what happened to Marcos."
This week in Washington, Mr. Nguza asked the World Bank and International Monetary fund to send teams to run Zaire's central bank and tax system as a step toward reforming the economy. He said today that his request had been granted and that two Zairian officials would remain here to work out details.
 
A Warning About Violence
 Mr. Nguza, who came to the United States a decade ago as an exile to seek, and be denied, backing against President Mobutu, returned to Zaire in 1985 and gradually reconciled himself with the President, a man Washington regarded as an ally against the leftist Government in Angola.
Mr. Nguza served as Zaire's Ambassador in Washington from 1986 to 1988, and then Foreign Minister. He was Prime Minister briefly in 1980.
He said that if President Mobutu is forced from office violently, the country will face civil war because all those who benefited from the President's rule will fight to retain their wealth and privileges. Poorly paid soldiers who went on looting rampages in September would be certain to join in the fray, he predicted.
Mr. Nguza said that he hoped that Zaire could avoid the violent "Liberian model" of political change and instead follow the "Zambian model." In a multiparty election in October, Zambia's President, Kenneth D. Kaunda, accepted his loss at the polls and stepped down immediately, allowing a smooth transition of power to the winner, Frederick J. Chiluba.

HEADLINE: Bush Walks Tightrope: Soviet Aid, Risks at Home

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
The Bush Administration created its plan to aid the Soviet economy in about five days. The plan for American economic recovery will have taken about five months by the time the President offers his promised growth proposals late in January.
This contrast in timing defines the problem Mr. Bush faces as he tries to fulfill the international obligations that are central to his duties as President, while at the same time preparing for an election that could turn on domestic problems. 
 By outlining a policy for dealing with the upheaval in the former Soviet Union, Mr. Bush could satisfy the first set of expectations and solidify his credentials as the leader of the much-proclaimed new world order, even if the plan seems unlikely to make much of a dent in the problems facing the Soviets.
But in dealing with the Soviet crisis, Mr. Bush risks walking into the trap that has been so eagerly laid by the Democrats vying for their party's nomination and by challengers from his own party's right wing.
For months, these critics have complained that Mr. Bush devotes too much attention to other countries' problems and not enough to America's. Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative who entered the Republican nomination race on Tuesday, has been lampooning the new world order as a betrayal of what he calls "America First" principles that ought to prevail when American workers are losing jobs to foreign competition.
Republicans and Democrats, including Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the House majority leader, have suggested that even if the President is effective overseas, he has done a poor job of explaining himself at home. This image was only reinforced when the new Soviet policy was presented by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d in a speech at Princeton University on Thursday, rather than by Mr. Bush himself in a nationally televised address.
 
Trying to Blunt Criticism
 Administration officials said Mr. Bush's initiative on the Soviet Union had been inspired solely by that country's political and economic crisis, one far deeper and more immediate than American economic problems. But Mr. Baker seemed to be trying to inoculate Mr. Bush against campaign-year criticism as he outlined the new policy.
By following the Administration's blueprint, he said, "We can prevail over the fearful isolationism that threatens to return us to the failures of the 1920's and 1930's. We can prevail over political paralysis to forge a bipartisan consensus about what has to be done and then, united at home, we can join with our allies to form a new coalition."
This fall, Mr. Bush has come under intense criticism, first for his unwillingness to consider economic growth measures and then for the deliberateness -- some say sluggishness -- with which he is developing such proposals.
Now, he has moved with startling speed on yet another foreign policy challenge. His aides are confident this will reinforce his image of a President who can be trusted with the nation's security. They argue that Mr. Bush has freedom to act in foreign affairs that is denied him in negotiating on domestic issues with a Democratic-controlled Congress and that whatever the political climate at home, his diplomatic portfolio is simply too important to be slighted.
 
Democrats' Bind
 Indeed, it has not been that long since Democrats were complaining that Mr. Bush was a passive spectator on the world stage, and the Administration's policy pronouncement left them in a double bind. It was unveiled as one of the Democratic Presidential contenders, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, was delivering a speech saying that Mr. Bush had not taken the lead on the Soviet crisis and suggesting actions that did not greatly diverge from Mr. Bush's plan.
But other opponents on the right and the left quickly moved to further their assault on what they view as Mr. Bush's weakest electoral flank.
"The fact of the matter is that he has come up with an economic plan for the Soviet Union more than a month before we can even expect an economic plan for the United States," said Lorraine Voles, spokeswoman for Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, who is running for the Democratic nomination. "It's once again a sign of the President just ignoring the domestic dilemmas that this country is facing."
Even those Democrats who have been pressing Mr. Bush to do more, not less, to aid the Soviet Union tried to chip away at Mr. Bush's grip on the foreign policy debate and to reinforce what even White House aides concede has been the President's difficulty in explaining himself to voters.
 
Letter From Gephardt
 Mr. Gephardt said in a letter to Mr. Bush on Thursday that his "modest measures are steps in the right direction but, given the enormity of the crisis, more explanations are needed and more actions may be necessary."
Mr. Gephardt urged Mr. Bush to address the nation about his Soviet policy, and his office pointed out to reporters that some key elements of Mr. Bush's plan, including the idea of assembling industrialized nations to coordinate aid, were proposed by Mr. Gephardt nearly two years ago.
Bush aides argued that it is in the direct economic interest of the United States to insure stability in the old Soviet Union.
 
Bush Campaign's View
 Charles Black, Mr. Bush's campaign chairman, said: "Throughout the campaign, we're going to have to repeat a message consistently that there is a threshold requirement for any President to manage national security and foreign relations. From an economic standpoint, there are more markets in a peaceful world than in a dangerous one and as the one superpower still standing, we have the clout to go out and expand markets."
Mr. Black acknowledged that these arguments are difficult to win in an election year, especially with rightists like Mr. Buchanan and liberals like Senator Harkin making emotional appeals to American self-interest.
But Mr. Bush may have no choice but to stick to foreign policy. His aides have yet to agree on any fix for the nation's economic problems, and it will take months to get any results. Beyond that, the Administration fundamentally believes the Government can and should be much more active in foreign affairs than on economic and social issues.
There are also tactical considerations.
"If you don't have any good economic news, you can't just sit there and do nothing," said Lance Torrance, a Republican political strategist. "You've got to show motion and that motion at the current time has to be on foreign affairs. You can be really hurt in politics, potentially fatally, not as the Democrats are saying by being imbalanced on the domestic versus foreign policy side, but by doing nothing."

HEADLINE: California's Credit Lowered in Face of Deficit

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Citing California's multibillion-dollar budget deficit, Standard & Poor's, one of the nation's top debt rating agencies, today lowered the state's credit rating from the highest rating of AAA.
In a sign of decreasing confidence in the state's ability to solve its fiscal problems, at least in the short term, the downgrading, to AA, means that the state will have to pay higher interest for the bonds that it sells to raise capital.
 
Long-Term Growth Expected
 The lowered rating comes at a time when California is facing an economic crisis that includes a projected $2.2 billion budget deficit, when some big companies are slashing jobs and others are moving out of state. 
 In response, Gov. Pete Wilson has proposed cutting welfare assistance to new residents, many of whom are undocumented immigrants, and has called on the Legislature to meet this month to seek urgent remedies.
The rating agency said, "While S.&P. expects that California's finances will eventually be balanced, it is not likely that the state will be able to improve its financial position to the point where it could avert future deficits resulting from economic downturns for at least several years." It added that it "expects long-term growth for the state, although likely at rates somewhat slower than in the last decade."
State Treasurer Kathleen Brown called the downgrading unwarranted and premature, citing the underlying strength of the state's economy. Saying California has fared better during the current nationwide recession than a number of other states including New York, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Maryland, she said, "Standard & Poor's decision is a little like the Grinch that stole Christmas."
New York State's Standard & Poor's rating has been A since 1989, when it was downgraded from AA minus.
Ms. Brown noted that California, which has historically had high credit ratings because of its ability to balance its budget and overcome its deficits, had in the past bounced back after temporary lowerings of its rating.
Ms. Brown said California expects to issue $11 billion in new bonds over the next two years and that the increased interest it would now be required to pay would probably cost it about $159 million. This would mean an increased cost to the state of about $8 million a year over the life of the bonds, she said.
Controller Gray Davis said, "There's no reason for panic." But he called for urgent measures to stop the flow of jobs and businesses from the state.
In taking today's action, the agency cited a report this week by the Commission on State Finance, a state auditing agency, that forecast a $2.2 billion deficit this fiscal year and a deficit next year of $1.3 billion to $3.1 billion.
"Serious discussions on deficit reduction have not yet occurred, and at this late date it is unlikely that actions can be taken to avert another deficit," it said in a news release. "The likely scenario will be a replay of last year's negotiations, which addressed budget gaps over two years. As a result, the state will be operating at a substantial deficit at least through fiscal 1993."
Under the law, the state is required to have a balanced budget.
Governor Wilson, a Republican, said earlier this week that the state was heading for a "fiscal train wreck." He said he would seek a constitutional amendment that would reduce welfare benefits to some poor families by nearly 25 percent and give him broad new powers to cut the budget. Of this year's $55.7 billion budget, $6 billion is being spent on aid to families with dependent children.
Mr. Wilson, calling for quick legislative action, also proposed spending cuts of nearly $1 billion that would affect renters, state employees and the poor.
Today's action downgraded the state's rating to AA, the level to which it had been lowered for two years in 1983 because of a severe budget deficit. California has had the agency's highest bond rating since 1986, when it was upgraded from AA plus.
New York State's debt rating of A reflects what the agency describes in its published analysis as "a contracting economic base, rising yet manageable debt burden and historically weak financial operations." The state's outlook is described as "negative."

HEADLINE: Hey, Nobody Pays Retail, Right?

BYLINE: By GEORGIA DULLEA

 BODY:
Turning a corner at Times Square, you come upon a line of 30 terrific-looking 25-year-olds outside a small loft building. It looks like the opening of a hot new club. But, no, it's better than that -- a sample sale of Italian sportswear. "Stuff I love," says a tall redhead, rolling her eyes, "and dirt cheap."
You're waiting for a light in the garment center now. Someone hands you a flier for a sample sale of beaded evening dresses. A minute later it's a flier for shearling coats, then lingerie, cashmere sweaters, leather jackets -- all being offered at, you are told, heartbreaking savings. 
 Some of the people passing out fliers hawk designer names like hot dogs: "Bill Blass here! Bill Blass!" A couple of them are moonlighting housewives. They get $8 an hour and possibly a break on the clothes. They're quite chic.
Coming up Seventh Avenue -- what's this? -- a parade of well-stuffed brown paper shopping bags. A bunch of the shopping bags peels off and disappears into an office building. You follow, not knowing you are about to enter a parallel shopping universe.
Inside the lobby is mobbed. "The sale's on the sixth floor -- Harve Benard," says Evelyn Becker, a real-estate agent. She is waiting by the elevators for her cousin to return from the cash machine. "They take credit cards, but we're both at our limit," Ms. Becker says, laughing. "We're sample-sale junkies. It's the sport of the 90's."
Now, as never before, New Yorkers are looking for deals on clothes. For the right price and the right label, some shoppers will ride freight elevators. They will strip down to their BVD's in drafty showrooms. They will carry wads of cash, endure long lines, call in sick with flu when what they really have is sample-sale fever.
"Look, it's a tight economy," said Marshall Goldberg, who owns a direct-mail equipment company and wears clothes by designers like Bill Robinson and Joseph Abboud. "For a bargain on high-quality merchandise, I'll shop on the subway."
 
Like Having an Uncle in the Business
 It may come to that. For the moment, Mr. Goldberg said, he and other men are perfecting the art of trying on clothes in showroom aisles in mixed company. After a year or so on the circuit he has come to suspect that "another guy running around in his underwear isn't outlandish -- not in New York."
Years ago you needed an uncle in the business to shop wholesale. Sample sales were small clubby arrangements to clear out showroom samples and other odd garments that manufacturers could not sell. Seventh Avenue has loosened up a lot since then.
With retail sales sagging, manufacturers and designers are selling off stock at wholesale prices or less to the public directly -- and supposedly discreetly -- though out-of-town tour groups have been trooping through some showrooms recently. There is talk that sample sales may one day replace Wednesday matinees.
"What's new is not just shopping for a bargain, but bragging about it," said Elysa Lazar of Lazar Media Group in Manhattan, which publishes The S & B Report, a monthly guide to unadvertised showroom sales. For $45 a year, the report alerts its 8,100 subscribers to the movement of merchandise from Armani to Valentino. For another $50, they can call in on Fridays for bulletins on late-breaking events like last week's Geoffrey Beene sale.
"It was very nicely done," a Beene customer said. "Two dressing rooms and a lady to zip you up."
This month more than 300 sales are in Ms. Lazar's report, twice the number two years ago. "As retail slips into what probably is its worse season ever, more and more companies are opening their showrooms," she said. "I don't know of one that's not selling the line to the public."
 
Shh! Don't Tell
 The sales are not widely advertised because the companies want to avoid appearing to be competing with retailers that carry their clothes. Word spreads through mass mailings, fliers, newsletters, special telephone lines and, of course, the office grapevine. This lends a hush-hush quality, like shopping in a speakeasy.
Shoppers like Bruce Kramer consider that part of the fun. "Then there's the adventure, the thrill of knowing you're getting unbelievably good-guy prices," said Mr. Kramer, a creative director at an advertising agency. "In New York nobody pays retail, right?"
For big productions, designers are hiring outside companies to stage the events in warehouses and other large spaces. A popular venue is the Parsons School of Design on Seventh Avenue at 40th Street, which some sample-sale buffs now consider their own outlet store. The operation has some of the amenities of retail shopping -- communal dressing area, coat-check room, speedy cashiers at the credit card and cash lines.
"We make these sales real events," said Richard Rosenthal, whose company, Samples Inc. of Pelham, N.Y., often manages group sales for several designers. "For them, it's a way to get close to their markup at wholesale without selling to discounters, to get rid of excess clothes -- either returns, excesses or overages."
Sample-sale managers worry, he said, "that if this thing gets too much attention we're going to have more problems with the stores and it will blow up in our faces."
Mr. Rosenthal added that his company ran the recent Emporio Armani sale in Norwalk, Conn. The decision to hold it there was a calculated one. "The sale had to be out of Manhattan," he said. "Armani was afraid of too much exposure."
Ah, the Armani sale. The Woodstock of shopping. Armani shoppers can tell you the clothes they bought, how much each garment cost -- and would have cost retail.
"You can see a class stratification on the lines to these sales," said Janet Fishman, a criminology professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. "A working girl might be at a Betsey Johnson sale. At the Escada sale you see women who might have walked out of Saks."
 
Like Macy's? Better.
 Dr. Fishman was standing in line outside the Parsons school last week for the Donna Karan sale when she saw something unusual. "A group of women standing in a circle around a leader. They were wearing fur jackets, designer sunglasses and the biggest smiles. It seemed almost as if they had come on a tour bus."
They had. The women -- 44 out-of-town visitors -- were on Sara Gardner's three-hour Wholesale Shopping Tour of the Garment Center. Ms. Gardner also publishes a guide to sample sales. It's called Fashion Update and is based in Brooklyn.
"When we start out on the bus," she said, "the ladies always say, 'Oh, Sara, take us to Macy's,' because they know the name. And I say, 'You can shop at Macy's by yourself. I'm going to take you to where Macy's shops."

HEADLINE: November Consumer Prices Up 0.4%

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
Consumer prices climbed four-tenths of 1 percent in November, with what may prove temporary surges in food, clothing and energy not fully offset by lower inflation for housing and medical care, the Labor Department reported today.
The rise, which followed a one-tenth of 1 percent advance in October, was a bit more than expected, but analysts said the latest figures did not significantly undermine the conviction that inflation was under control, and with the economy weak, it was unlikely to flare up anytime soon. 
 "The outlook for inflation remains excellent," said William C. Dunkelberg, dean at the Temple University business school and a consultant to the National Federation of Independent Business. He cited a new membership survey showing that more companies cut prices over the last six months than increased them -- the first time this has happened since the survey began in 1973 -- and that companies' plans to raise prices in coming months were also at a record low.
Some analysts, however, struck a cautionary note, saying that while a weak economy produces little demand, it does not significantly expand supplies, a factor that could create bottlenecks and consequently price spikes.
Even though the Consumer Price Index for all urban consumers rose at a 3.6 percent annual rate in the latest three months, up from a 2.7 percent rate in the three months through August, analysts say the Federal Reserve is likely to move again shortly to cut interest rates in an effort to reinvigorate the economy.
Prices in the New York metropolitan area jumped six-tenths of 1 percent last month after edging down slightly in October. Of the other four major cities for which prices are published on a current basis, Los Angeles posted a four-tenths of 1 percent increase, but Chicago, Philadelphia and San Francisco showed no significant change.
A separate Government report today showed that business inventories rose four-tenths of 1 percent in October, the second straight increase, on soaring retailer inventories. Sales grew by three-tenths of 1 percent, however, and the inventory-sales ratio remained at 1.50, meaning it would take a month and a half to clear shelves at the current sales pace.
 
Consumer Sentiment Index
 In the first bit of data for December, the University of Michigan told subscribers that its preliminary reading of consumer sentiment rose slightly, to 70.4, from the 69.1 to which the index plunged in November.
Analysts said that little could be learned from the inventory figures, but that the consumer confidence figures at least seemed to contribute to a rise in the stock market; the Dow Jones industrial average gained 19.23 points today.
Food was one of the biggest factors driving up consumer prices, rising six-tenths of 1 percent after two months of negligible up and down. The price of fruits and vegetables spurted 4.4 percent, with lettuce and tomatoes soaring 44.5 and 12.7 percent, respectively, reflecting whitefly infestations in California. Beef and veal prices rose nine-tenths of 1 percent after five straight declines, but pork, poultry and eggs declined and oranges dropped 17.1 percent after a 14.4 percent drop in October.
Energy prices advanced eight-tenths of 1 percent, with gasoline, fuel oil and natural gas rising sharply, while electricity fell seven-tenths of 1 percent.
 
Core Rate Up 0.3%
 The so-called core rate of inflation, which excludes the often gyrating food and energy components, rose three-tenths of 1 percent in November, about the same pace as the average increase for the two preceding months.
In transportation, the price of new vehicles rose two-tenths of 1 percent -- the proportion of 1992 car models in the index is now just over 50 percent -- and airline fares rose 2.2 percent. But automobile finance charges fell 1.4 percent, their third straight decline.
Clothes prices advanced 1 percent, with women's and girls' clothes up nearly twice that much, the report showed. Seasonal adjustment factors contribute to big swings in apparel, which accounts for only 6 percent of the Consumer Price Index.
Inflation in medical care, which was five-tenths of 1 percent in November, has now eased one-tenth of a point in each of the last three months. Since November 1990 medical costs have risen 8 percent, with prescription drugs up 10.1 percent.
Among other goods and services, a 1.9 percent leap in tobacco prices accounted for nearly two-thirds of the month's increase of seven-tenths of 1 percent.
Viewing the Consumer Price Index market basket another way, goods rose six-tenths of 1 percent last month, twice as much as in October, while inflation in services remained at three-tenths of 1 percent.
A separate index covering urban wage earners and clerical workers, the C.P.I.-W, rose five-tenths of 1 percent last month after a one-tenth of 1 percent increase in October.
Despite the sanguine view taken in today's report, some analysts see little if any further improvement in inflation, which has run at a 3 percent rate over the last 12 months.

HEADLINE: Bond News is Good, but Prices Fall

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury notes and bonds moved lower yesterday despite a batch of reports that analysts called uniformly favorable for holders of fixed-income securities.
The reports included a four-tenths of a percent rise in the November Consumer Price Index; figures showing that business inventories rose for the second straight month during October, and numbers from the nation's auto makers that indicated the very sluggish sales pace that has been in place for the last several months did not suddenly change during the first 10 days of December. 
 The increase in consumer prices was slightly higher than most economists had expected, but even with the rise on a year-over-year basis consumer prices have risen a modest 3 percent. While the consumer price numbers appeared to reaffirm the sense that inflationary pressures have continued to moderate, analysts said the inventory numbers carried potentially disturbing news for the economy.
 
Inventory Buildup
 "The rise in inventories, particularly among retailers, tells you that stocks are building up at the point of final sales," said Joseph Liro, a senior vice president and economist at S. G. Warburg & Company. "Unless demand picks up to meet those increases, at some point soon production is going to have to be cut."
Rather than focus on the data, dealers instead chose to home in on a rise in commodity prices and on rumors that the Bush Administration was in the process of constructing a highly stimulative fiscal package for the economy. At the end of a week when prices moved generally higher, those developments offered an adequate excuse to lighten positions.
"We are getting closer to year-end, and at this time of the year people want to get closer to shore," one government bond trader said.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered late yesterday at a price of 10222/32 , down 5/32 , to yield 7.76 percent, compared with 7.75 percent late Thursday and 7.80 percent on Dec. 6.
 
Treasury Note Trading
 Among Treasury note issues, in late trading the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered at 102 1/8, down 1/8 point, to yield 7.19 percent.
Yesterday the Treasury announced it would sell $13.5 billion of new two-year notes and $9 billion of new five-year notes at auctions on Wednesday and Thursday. For many credit market participants, those debt sales will be the last significant events of 1991.
In when-issued trading following the announcement, the two-year notes were offered at a price to yield 5.07 percent. The new five-year notes were offered at a price to yield 6.27 percent.
Rates on short-term Treasury bills were narrowly mixed.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 4.13 percent late yesterday, down one basis point, or one one-hundredth of a percentage point. Six-month bill rates rose by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 4.16 percent. And rates on one-year bills rose by two basis points, to a late offered rate of 4.20 percent.
Participants in the tax-exempt municipal bond market said that prices of outstanding general obligation bonds issued by the State of California were little changed after the Standard & Poor's Corporation announced it had downgraded its rating on approximately $15.1 billion of the state's debt to AA from AAA.
Although the timing of the move was something of a surprise, the conditions that prompted the change have been known for some time, traders said. Those conditions have been reflected in bond prices for some weeks. Standard & Poor's cited the state's chronic budget deficit as the principal reason for the downgrade.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Closes Mostly Higher And Gold Prices Are Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar advanced against most other currencies yesterday, helped by concerns about the Soviet Union.
Gold prices closed mixed, rising in New York after falling overseas. 
 The dollar, which is seen as a haven amid political uncertainty overseas, generally rises when there is strife in major countries.
But it was unable to rise further because of expectations that the Federal Reserve, whose policy-making committee meets next week, will push interest rates down again to stimulate the economy.
The dollar tends to fall in tandem with interest rates because lower yields weaken foreign demand for American investments.
Traders said the Government's report on consumer prices yesterday gave the Fed more leeway to ease its monetary policy. The Labor Department said prices rose a moderate four-tenths of 1 percent in November.
The British pound gained against the dollar, rising to $1.8160 in New York from late Thursday's $1.8065. In earlier London trading, sterling rose to $1.8165, from $1.8080 late Thursday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Thursday's prices, included: 1.5885 German marks, up from 1.5835; 1.4040 Swiss francs, up from 1.3995; 5.4255 French francs, up from 5.4110; 1,198.50 Italian lire, up from 1.196.00, and 1.14255 Canadian dollars, up from 1.13265.
The dollar fell against the Japanese yen, slipping to 129 in New York from 129.30. In Tokyo overnight, the dollar closed at 128.73 yen, down 0.17 yen, and in London, it was quoted at 128.85.
Analysts said the yen was strengthened by the surge in stock prices in Tokyo yesterday.
Gold rose $1.40 on the Commodity Exchange in New York, closing at $359.40 an ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $359.00, up $1.25.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $358.60, down 90 cents from late Thursday. In Zurich, gold fell to a closing bid of $358.90 from $359.95. In Hong Kong, gold dropped $6.48 an ounce to close at $359.75.
Silver picked up 1.3 cents on the Commodity Exchange to close at $3.835 an ounce. In London, silver was unchanged from late Thursday's bid of $3.85.

HEADLINE: Your Taxes;
A Court Decision For Scientologist

BYLINE: By Robert D. Hershey Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
In a decision that has roiled long-established practice, a Federal appeals court has legitimized a challenge to deductions for certain charitable contributions by a Scientologist, who contended that he had been a victim of discrimination.
At issue is the deductibilty of contributions to religious organizations when the church or synagogue provides something in return. 
 The decision in question, issued this autumn when the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit, in Atlanta, vacated a district court's dismissal, backs an assertion by a member of the church that the I.R.S. discriminated against him by denying his charitable deduction on the ground that his payments were tied to a specific benefit: one-on-one sessions with a church figure for which a price list is published and payment required.
George H. Powell's victory means that the matter must now be reconsidered in court, and the I.R.S. and others are forced to take a fresh look at Scientology's contention that mainstream religious organizations also provide a quid pro quo for participation in religious services. At issue are such things as pew rents, Mass stipends, High Holy Day tickets, and tithes. Protestants, Roman Catholics, Jews and Mormons employ one or more of these.
The Church of Scientology has fought with the Internal Revenue Service over its status for years.
Although few believe that the charitable deduction, one of the most widely used, will ultimately be compromised or lost, it seems possible that Scientology will gain equal footing. Consequently, the decision is being taken seriously both by the service and by some church representatives here. "It might stick," said Donald C. Alexander, a former head of the I.R.S. and now a Washington consultant to nonprofit groups. "It's not a frivolous issue."
 
Higher Standard Deduction
 For 1992, according to newly published I.R.S. inflation adjustments, the standard deduction will rise by $300, to $6,000, for joint returns and surviving spouses and by $200, to $3,600, for singles. The deduction will be $5,250 for heads of household and $3,000 for married people filing separately. Each personal exemption will rise $150, to $2,300, with the maximum basic earned-income credit at $1,324 for a worker with one child and $1,384 for two or more children. Those claiming the credit may also be entitled to a health insurance credit of up to $451 and a credit of up to $376 for a child born during 1992.
Additional standard deductions for old age and blindness rise $60, to $700 for couples and $900 for singles.
But the Social Security levy will bite harder for many in the new year as the taxable wage base rises to $55,500 from $53,400. Moreover, the Medicare base rises to $130,200 from $125,000. The combined tax rate remains at 7.65 percent -- 6.2 percent for Social Security and 1.45 percent for Medicare.
Meanwhile, benefits under Social Security rise 3.7 percent in January to reflect inflation as gauged by the Consumer Price Index.
 
Footnotes
 Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said he would seek re-election to an 18th term. Representative Frank Annunzio, who as a result of Illinois redistricting had been a prospective opponent, decided to retire. At the I.R.S., Michael P. Dolan has been named deputy commissioner, replacing Michael J. Murphy.
The New York State Department of Taxation and Finance is one of six organizations to win the first I.R.S. Quality Supplier Awards. They magnetically transmitted more than 500,000 information documents for 1989 and 1990 with no formatting or validity errors.
A deputy registrar in Ohio's Bureau of Motor Vehicles may not deduct as a political contribution any part of the 10 percent of his office's receipts he agreed to pay the Butler County Democratic Party for the support needed to get and keep the job. The United States Tax Court also said in its decision that while a reasonable person in the registrar's position could believe the job to be dependent on the payments -- subsequently barred by Ohio law -- the payments could not be deducted as business expenses, either.
President Bush on Wednesday signed the bill that extends for six months a dozen expiring tax breaks and raises quarterly estimated tax payments for corporations.

HEADLINE: Middle-Class and Jobless, They Share Sorrows

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAMDEN, Conn., Dec. 13

 BODY:
As a chill rain soaked the bare trees and a "House for Sale" sign outside, 11 people sat around a living room in this middle-class enclave today and told two members of Congress what a faltering economy had done to their once-satisfying lives.
"We feel we are typical of the people for whom the American Dream fell flat on its face," said the hostess, Elaine Feldman, as the House Majority Leader, Richard A. Gephardt, and Representative Rosa DeLauro nodded sympathetically. "We did everything right. Now, in our 50's, we find ourselves losing our home, and where do we go?" 
 The meeting, arranged by the office of Ms. DeLauro, a freshman Democrat from New Haven, lasted just over an hour. But in that time, an assortment of cries for help went out, from people who had part-time jobs or no jobs, from people worried about how to pay for health care, from people wondering when, or if, the economy would get better.
They included people like Joel Goldberg, who inherited a 15-man electrical contracting company from his father three years ago. Now, he said, the business consists only of himself. And there was Kenny Foscue, who is getting laid off at the end of the month from his job at a nonprofit agency that tries to prevent people in similar straits from being evicted. All were members of a support group based in nearby New Haven that organizes discussions among people who have lost their jobs.
 
'No Magic Button'
 The politicians offered them a few proposals but warned that there would be no immediate improvement. "There's no magic button," Mr. Gephardt said.
The Democrat from Missouri, who said the sickly economy "is the major issue in the country everywhere I go," said he would try to add money to a transportation jobs bill that was approved by Congress last month. He expressed support for job training and a proposed bill, one of Ms. DeLauro's ideas, that would grant tax relief to middle- and lower-income people, which, he said, "would give people a little more confidence to go into the stores, get this economy up on its feet."
Yet the disillusionment described by members of the support group indicated a much deeper problem. "It's not just the blue-collar worker who's involved -- it's everyone," said William Keeley, a former bank vice president who was laid off earlier this year. He spoke of lost self-esteem, as did others, and of being overqualified for the few jobs they managed to land interviews for.
"When you've lived your life a certain way and had a certain kind of job, you have a certain personality," said Lee Russell, who was laid off in April from his job as an engineering firm's librarian. Now he and his wife, Kia, another member of the group, work as part-time Santas at a local shopping mall.
 
Executive Turned Clerk
 Others noted that, in the search for jobs, some priorities fall by the wayside. "There's a difference now," Mr. Keeley said, "between career path and survival." He told of one group member, who did not attend today, a former executive now working as a clerk in a consumer-electronics store.
And Mrs. Feldman told of her disappointment and shock when, after her husband was laid off seven months ago, her $16,000 salary became their primary source of income. This month, they missed their first mortgage payment in 27 years, and they are trying, without much luck, to sell the ranch house where their three children grew up and where the Feldmans amassed the collections of porcelain figurines and antique salt cellars that they display in their living room.
"We were planning to stay here forever," Mrs. Feldman said. They put the house on the market shortly after her husband was laid off, and since then they have cashed in his life-insurance policy, sold some jewelry and budgeted themselves $6 a day for meals.
Most of the time, Mrs. Feldman said, she believes that no one in power realizes her plight. "You feel like that Zen tree that falls, and there's no noise if there's nobody there to hear it," she said. But with two members of Congress in her house today, she said, she was a bit encouraged.
Mr. Gephardt said he had agreed to attend at the request of Ms. DeLauro. He added that he holds the same kind of sessions in his own district and hears the same laments.
Mrs. Feldman's husband, Jerry, said he had heard reports that the economy would recover sometime "in the second half of the third quarter of 1992," but he added, "If I have to wait that long, I'm not going to have anything left."

HEADLINE: Long Delayed, New Town In Queens Appears Dead

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED

 BODY:
A long-stalled effort to build a "new town" on a vast ocean-front site in Queens has stalled again because the poor economy has forced the developer to withdraw, city officials said yesterday.
They said that the 23-year-old Arverne urban renewal project in the Rockaways -- already one of the nation's most notorious examples of redevelopment gone nowhere -- suffered its latest setback when the developer of the latest plan for the site, Oceanview Associates of Manhattan, pulled out last week. 
 Oceanview was to buy the mostly barren, two-mile-long tract from the city for almost $70 million and, over a decade, build a $1.5 billion complex of 7,500 apartments, shopping malls and parks. The apartments, mostly in town houses, were to be priced to sell or rent to families with annual incomes of $45,000 to $80,000 under the plan, announced in 1989.
But Oceanview has withdrawn because "the downturn in the economy has depressed prospects for the successful development of market-rate housing on as large a scale as we had originally contemplated at this site," said Barbara J. Fife, the Deputy Mayor for Planning and Development.
 
Series of Smaller Projects
 As a result, she said, the city and Oceanview had "reached the joint conclusion that it is more realistic to develop Arverne as a series of discrete, smaller projects by separate developers within the urban renewal area, rather than proceeding with a single, master developer."
A spokeswoman for Oceanview, Michele de Milly, said that in the recession there was less consumer interest in buying housing and "financial institutions are not financing real-estate development projects."
Ms. Fife said that specifics of the smaller proposals now envisioned for Arverne were still to be drawn up and that she could not tell how long this would take. But people familiar with the complexities of urban renewal planning said that, at best, the latest setback could further delay the Arverne project by several years.
Last spring city officials spoke of this prospect as both the recession and the city's fiscal problems worsened and there were reports that Oceanview was having trouble obtaining financing. Ms. Fife herself said at that time that the project "may not happen in the next couple of years, until market conditions change."
But it was not until last week that Oceanview withdrew, and Ms. Fife formally announced the action yesterday, after a report of it appeared in New York Newsday.
Ms. Fife expressed optimism that the Arverne site -- 300 acres of mostly barren, weed-filled and litter-strewn lots -- would yet be redeveloped. The tract was approved for urban renewal in 1968 and nearly 4,000 deteriorated old buildings were demolished. However, little of the envisioned new housing materialized.
Obstacles included the city's fiscal crisis of the 1970's and sharp cutbacks in Federal housing subsidies. Other proposals for the tract that came and went involved gambling casinos and a recreation complex similar to Tivoli Gardens in Copenhagen.

HEADLINE: Albert H. Gaynes, 73, Former Steel Executive

 BODY:
Albert H. Gaynes, a retired steel executive and an advocate for political and social causes, died on Monday at his home in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. He was 73 years old.
He died of cancer, his family said.
From 1949 to 1979 he worked for the Capitol Steel Company, fabricators of reinforcing steel for concrete construction. He served as a vice president and director for most of that period and was a one-third owner. From 1980 to 1990, he was a marketing and management consultant and also ran Gaynes Enterprises, a sales company dealing in minerals and ores. 
 In the 1980's he made several trips to El Salvador and Nicaragua, working with groups trying to change United States policy. He also aided efforts to improve relations between blacks and Jews in New York City. He was a director of the National Emergency Civil Liberties Committee, the Fund for New Priorities in America, and Curbstone Press, which publishes material on Latin America. Last year he became a part-time community liaison for Assemblyman Richard Brodsky, a Democrat from Westchester.
Born in Staten Island, Mr. Gaynes grew up in Manhattan and the Bronx. He graduated from City College and for two years was an economics instructor there. He served five years in the Army in World War II, reaching the rank of first lieutenant. After the war he taught for four years at Marymount College in Tarrytown, N.Y.
He is survived by his wife, the former Deborah Libert; two daughters, Elizabeth of White Plains, and Susan of Cazenovia, N.Y.; a brother, Sanford of Plainview, L.I., and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: So Many Children, So Few Toys

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
When it comes to this year's most popular toys and games forget all that has been said about the recession dampening demand. Retailers and toy industry observers report that the hot items are disappearing as fast as in any other year. And some of the products may not be back on the shelves before Christmas.
This year's spurt of demand for some toys can be attributed both to the usual fads generated by popular movies or television shows and to the soaring number of births that have occurred in the last few years. 
 Manufacturers said there was no way to predict accurately which toys on the market would become runaway best sellers. Each year, they said, there are surprises. When a trend becomes apparent, toy makers try to meet the demand.
United States census figures showed that in 1989, the most recent figures available, there were already two million more children under 5 years old than there were in 1984 -- adding up to about 18.4 million youngsters. Diane Cardinale, a spokeswoman with the Toy Manufacturers of America, a national trade group in New York City, speculates that many of those children are the first-born of older parents. These parents, she said, "have traditionally spent the most on their kids." And the age group provides the biggest market for toys.
 
Buyers FavorLike Dolls and Blocks

 
 Unlike Christmas seasons past, when one item -- the Cabbage Patch doll or the pet rock -- dominated the must-buy lists, shoppers are retreating to more conventional gifts, according to Bob Seligman, the editor of Toy and Hobby World, a trade publication in New York City.
Buyers are favoring dolls and building blocks now. These playthings are very popular, he said, because people seem to be spending moneymore carefully. Parents are also fond of toys that recall their childhood, like Erector Sets. "Even Monopoly is coming back strong," he added.
Among the most popular novelty items is the Nerf Bow 'N' Arrow by Parker Brothers, a toy weapon that shoots spongelike arrows. It is intended for the kindergarteners and sells for about $20. "We're totally out right now," said Brooke Adkins, a spokeswoman for the F.A.O. Schwarz toy-store chain.
Anything to do with mermaids may likely be cleaned off the shelf. Among very young children, the Walt Disney movie "The Little Mermaid" and its video cassette has kept demand high for related toys and games. Retailers say the mermaid dolls are becoming to preschoolers what Barbie has been to their older sisters.
The best selling mermaids are the original Ariel, the Little Mermaid, made by Tyco Toys, and its new Christmas cousin, Holiday Ariel. There's also Mattel's Little Miss Singing Mermaid, whose tail changes its color when the mermaid is slipped under water.
Among the high-tech sellouts are Magic Copier, another Tyco toy that has a screen to draw on and prints out the artwork on colored paper. The new 16-bit Genesis home video game by Sega of America is also big. The Super Nintendo Entertainment System is also selling well; retailers are apparently keeping up with the demand.
Manufacturers are trying to restock items continually, so it is worth returning to the store or calling ahead to find out if the toy you want is there.
One toy retailers are unlikely to get in again soon if it sells out is the new Preschool Radio Control Car from Playskool. The car comes as a fire chief's or police car. Both have taken off with unexpected speed.
"We don't expect to meet demand this year," said Wayne Charness, a vice president of Hasbro, the manufacturer's parent company, based in Pawtucket, R.I.

HEADLINE: The Speaker's Conviction

 BODY:
Yesterday's conviction of Mel Miller, Speaker of the New York State Assembly, effectively ends the political career of a bright, outspoken lawmaker whose liberal views and flamboyant style helped shape the political debate in Albany for years. The guilty verdict also throws a floundering state capital, struggling to cope with the impact of a sinking economy, further into confusion.
Under state law, Mr. Miller's conviction on charges of dealing unethically with clients for personal gain means automatic expulsion from the Assembly seat he's held for 21 years and ends his five-year role as Speaker -- the most powerful Democratic legislator in the state. James Tallon Jr. of Binghamton becomes the Acting Speaker. 
 But until Assembly Democrats select a permanent successor to Mr. Miller, sensitive negotiations to close a daunting budget gap estimated at $4.5 billion are likely to make little progress. That is especially true in light of Gov. Mario Cuomo's protracted flirtation with national politics.
It is of some solace to New Yorkers that Mr. Miller's conviction was related to his private law practice; it had nothing to do with his job in Albany. He contends he was the victim of a "political witch hunt," and an appeals panel may ultimately agree. For now, though, the conviction reinforces the Legislature's reputation for attracting people of questionable ethics and promoting them to positions of power. Even if Mr. Miller's guilty verdict is ultimately reversed, he was guilty of poor judgment and a willingness to cut corners in pursuit of profit.
His downfall is a personal tragedy. It is also a blow to New York, because Mr. Miller often added a voice of reason -- and quirky humor -- to the contentious swirl of Albany politics. An unapologetic liberal, he fought effectively for the poor and elderly, mastered the complicated budget process, hired competent professionals for his staff, and dealt deftly with the difficult Mr. Cuomo and the quietly contrary Senate majority leader, Ralph Marino, a Republican.
Mr. Miller was, as well, every inch a politician. He vigorously advocated an irresponsibly large income tax cut, which has contributed substantially to the state's current budget crisis. Though he first supported a gasoline tax, he later reversed himself in the interests of political expediency. And while he championed full disclosure of campaign contributions, he refused to identify contributors to his legal defense fund.
Whatever his flaws, Mr. Miller's exit from the Albany scene will hurt. It leaves a hole in leadership at a precarious moment in New York. Prompt action by Assembly Democrats to pick a successor is the only responsible course.

Running, Anyone?

BYLINE: By ANNA QUINDLEN

 BODY:
Talking to Mario Cuomo is like playing tennis with Jimmy Connors. By the time you put down the phone, the only proper response seems to be to kick back, hang a towel around your neck and drink a bottle of Gatorade.
You've made it through the suggestion that you don't take the state budget crisis seriously enough, the quotation from the prophet Jeremiah ("you will find your own strength in the strength of the whole community"), the speech about how liberals lost his parents and the rest of the lower middle class, and a gleeful first person plural recitation of defeat: ". . . when we got killed by Krupsak, when we lost to Koch, when Carey made a fool of us . . ." All in the service of one little question. 
 Everywhere you go people are asking whether Mario Cuomo is running for President. It makes sense to ask the man himself except that in a true/false world, Mr. Cuomo has always been taking an essay test. There will be no simple answers.
Q. "How are you, Governor?" A. "I am ontologically good. That makes them crazy, boy."
He hoped to be like Joe DiMaggio, one of his heroes, a man no one ever made a joke about. Instead Johnny Carson lampoons his indecision. ("Isn't this guy married five times?" Mr. Cuomo rejoins.) There is, of course, another way to look at this, and that is that when Johnny Carson is taking your name in vain, you're at the center of the universe.
Mr. Cuomo's free fall has turned out to be sensationally effective. People on the street who don't know Bill Clinton from Bob Kerrey are asking about Mario Cuomo. He has become a little like the girl in high school whose greatest allure was that she kept turning you down for a date. Even when she turns out to be a perfectly ordinary girl, you've got to continue to invest her with a golden glow so you don't feel the fool.
The other candidates slog through debates and hardware stores, and every day someone takes the temperature of Mr. Cuomo's temperament. After my interview I clutch close a prepositional phrase. "In all likelihood," he said. In all likelihood, if he can reach a budget agreement, he will declare his candidacy for President of the United States.
Incumbent Presidents do this all the time; they say that the affairs of state are so pressing that they could not possibly think about running for re-election. What this means is that they're going to work on their weaknesses before they start formally pressing the flesh on Main Street.
Mr. Cuomo is trying to do precisely the same thing with the state budget. He knows the drill: "Then you're in Indiana saying 'I'll show you how to save this country' and somebody holds up page one of The New York Times and says 'Really, Governor?' " Not this guy. "I could not possibly declare a candidacy until I got this situation reasonably under control," he says. Reasonably under control is defined in classic Cuomo fashion. It is like Potter Stewart's take on obscenity. He'll know it when he sees it.
The deadline for filing for the New Hampshire primary is Friday. Mr. Cuomo rejects unequivocally -- ah, what a relief, an unequivocal rejection! -- the suggestion that if he runs he might skip some primaries. But at the mere whiff of yielding to desire or ambition, he goes up like a rocket. "I've spent a lifetime trying to diminish what I want to do," he says. In other words, the Presidency as self-abnegation.
He dwells on his defeats, acting the underdog. "The state didn't believe I could be governor in April 1982," he says, "38 points behind and no money." And the country didn't believe George Bush could be beaten in April 1991, except for Paul Tsongas, who drew a little graph of the ups and downs of the economy in my notebook, wrote the words "Nov. 1992" next to a big dip, and topped the whole thing off with a question mark.
The question mark remains. It's hard to know how the American people would feel after a year of "ontologically good." But for now Mario Cuomo is the overdog. People like me, with notebooks to fill and an affection for black and white, complain about his indecision, his adherence to his own body clock, his refusal to provide simple answers. And people on the street want to know if he's going to run. The mind of the body politic is on Mr. Cuomo, and Mr. Cuomo continues to play his own game.

HEADLINE: U.S. Shipbuilding Withers as Japan's Thrives

 BODY:
To the Editor:
To the families of the 50,000 American shipyard workers who have lost their jobs in the last decade, the 50th anniversary of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor will be a harsh reminder that the United States shipbuilding industry, which helped bring victory over Japan in World War II, is on the verge of collapse, while Japan has emerged as the strongest shipbuilding country in the world. 
 What happened to reverse the fortunes of the once-proud United States shipbuilding industry, which churned out thousands of ships (5,400 between 1943 and 1945, the height of its productivity) to support the war effort?
Part of the answer lies in government subsidies used to prop up foreign shipyards and thereby assure their ability to capture market share. Japan led the way, pouring billions of dollars into its shipbuilding industry ($4.4 billion was budgeted for this purpose by the Japanese Government from 1987 through 1990 alone). By contrast, the United States industry saw its subsidy program terminated in 1981.
But another part of the story concerns our Government's naive and destructive industrial policies, which have emphasized short-term goals over our country's economic health and impotent responses to predatory practices of our trading partners that have resulted in the export of American jobs. The Bush Administration continues the assumption that American industry is noncompetitive without analyzing the far different structural and protectionist roles employed by other governments.
The beginning of the end for American shipyards was in 1981. At that time, when other governments were escalating their shipbuilding aid, the United States Government not only terminated its commercial shipbuilding support subsidy, but actually passed a measure to encourage United States-flag shipowners to bypass American yards and buy where they could get the best foreign subsidy.
In addition, the Government turned a blind eye to Japanese Government practices that permitted Japan's industry to create a cartel and to manage a restructuring through market allocation and price setting.
In June 1989, the Shipbuilders Council of America filed a trade petition outlining the extent to which foreign governments subsidize their shipyards. Recognizing the petition's merit, Carla Hills, the United States trade representative, initiated an effort within the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development to get foreign governments to cease their subsidy practices. In the subsequent two-and-a-half years of negotiations, little progress has been made.
The Japanese, who deny that their governmental practices distort competitive conditions in the shipbuilding marketplace, have made it clear they are not interested in ending those practices or in disciplining Government behavior in the marketplace.
The United States shipbuilding and repair industry understand that international competitiveness is the key to survival in a marketplace in which defense dollars will be in short supply. But if we cannot get the Japanese to agree to end their shipbuilding subsidies, the question our workers will ask is, What will the Bush Administration do to insure that we are not sacrificed to the predatory practices of others?
Representative Sam Gibbons of Florida, chairman of the House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee, has introduced H.R. 2056, a bill to penalize foreign ships built with subsidies. We strongly support the shipbuilding trade reform bill.

HEADLINE: Unemployment Issues Go Beyond Race

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Two letters Nov. 12 criticize an Oct. 29 article and comments by me about Timothy Smeeding's study comparing anti-poverty efforts in the United States, Western Europe and Canada. Roger Wilkins complains about the failure to recognize the special American problem, race, and Sheila Kamerman and Alfred J. Kahn disagree with my assertion that social spending in the United States cannot be one-dimensionally compared to that in the prosperous and largely segregated countries of Western Europe. 
 The contradictory nature of the two letters, I think, demonstrates the dangers of cross-cultural comparisons.
Unlike Western European countries, we have large numbers of teen-agers who have babies out of wedlock and then go on welfare. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 77 percent of all unwed teen-age mothers go on welfare within five years of their first child's birth -- and many stay there for 10 years or more.
Few analysts question that welfare payments act as a work disincentive, particularly for young people without work experience; they just argue about its size. In a study for the University of Wisconsin Institute on Poverty, Robert Moffitt estimates that every dollar transferred to female-headed households reduces the mother's work effort by 37 cents.
Of greater concern to me, however, are Professor Wilkins's comments about nonwork being a code word for race. If you don't work, you are likely to be poor (unless you are the child of a millionaire). About half of all the poor do not work at all.
Mr. Wilkins seems to assume that it is blacks and other racial minorities who are not working. In making this assumption, he himself falls victim to racial stereotyping.
Actually, the overall labor force participation rates of whites and blacks are roughly equal. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the rates for white and black 25- to 64-year-olds are about 79 percent and 75 percent, respectively. African-Americans with at least a high school education have higher levels of participation than their white counterparts. Overall black rates are slightly lower than for whites only because blacks tend to have less schooling.
The failure to graduate from high school is now the most important predictor of nonwork among all groups except white female dropouts. Rates for them have risen to those of black female dropouts because they are now substantially less likely to marry. Among male high school dropouts of both races, labor force rates fell by almost 20 percent.
Only among male high school dropouts is the black rate lower than the white (for those 16 and older, about 47 percent to 56 percent). This difference shows the distressing plight of many young, black males. Their condition seems the indisputable result of discrimination -- and attention is required.
These data, however, show a broader -- and deeper -- trend of declining labor force participation among poorly educated men of all races. Are our schools failing the disadvantaged? Or are deeper social processes at work, fed by higher levels of social permissiveness and social welfare incentives against work? My own guess is that it is a mixture of the three.
If we don't confront the issues of nonwork, we will never be able to do anything about the resulting poverty. Probably without intending it, Professor Wilkins has lent his considerable prestige to the quite dangerous suggestion that talking about nonwork is racist.

Anglers Warm to 'Letting Them Go'

BYLINE: By Ken Schultz; Ken Schultz is a fishing editor for Field & Stream magazine and the author of seven books on angling.

 BODY:
"Let them go, let them grow" is a sport-fishing slogan of the Saskatchewan Parks and Natural Resources Department that reflects a growing attitude in this Western province and across Northern Canada. Steve MacKinnon, a native of Prince Albert and a lodge owner in Northern Saskatchewan, supports the province's catch-and-release policy, even though it occasionally puts him on the defensive.
MacKinnon, whose Ena Lake Lodge opened last summer, voluntarily adopted the policy to maintain and enhance the good fishing at the lake, a 15-mile, glacial-carved body of water just a short cast from the border of the Northwest Territories. 
 "Sure, the catch-and-release-only policy has cost us some business already," he said. "We had two groups that were ready to come here but some of the members wanted to take a trophy fish home if they caught one, and we won't allow it. The leader of one group told me, 'When you change your policy, call me.' I lost over $10,000 from that possible booking, but this is the way it has to be. I want my customers to come back and to know that there will always be good fishing opportunities."
MacKinnon is not alone, and the anglers who won't book a trip because they can't kill what they catch are becoming fewer. There is a growing trend in the fishing lodges in Saskatchewan, Manitoba and the Northwest Territories, where there is a limited fishing season and which are reached by floatplane only, to attempt to conserve the resource that attracts anglers, the majority of whom are from the United States.
Most of the remote lodges charge between $2,000 and $3,000 per week, plus commercial airfare. The astute owners know that for anglers willing to pay these prices, going home with a few fillets of fish is of less importance than having a quality experience, receiving personal attention, recording their catch on camera and having the chance to enjoy a rare commodity.
It wasn't always this way. Not too long ago, many Northern anglers measured their success in the weight of fish boxes leaving the lodge or camp, or the number of trophy fish that they caught. Lawrence Shewchuk of Red Lake, Ontario, a recent visitor to Ena Lake, observed that many lodge owners had allowed their clients to take too many fish out of once-prime water.
A former lodge owner turned real estate agent who brokers fishing lodges, Shewcuk noted the economic irony. "I represent some older lodge owners whose lakes have seen their better days," he said, "and they want to sell their operation for what it used to be, not what it is. Now they offer mediocre fishing, or the better fishing is a long haul away from where their camp is located, and it will be a while before that is changed."
The further north one goes, the more acute this is. In many waters it takes three or four decades to grow a lake trout of trophy proportions (30 to 40 pounds). Now, many anglers and lodge owners realize that such prized fish cannot be replaced quickly, if at all, in their lifetime.
Shane MacKinnon is especially sensitive to this problem. Ena Lake is one of the premier lake trout waters in Saskatchewan. Though smaller than huge bodies of water like Lake Athabasca (which is a short distance to the south) and Reindeer Lake, it has never received commercial fishing (another factor that influences resources in northern lakes), and has only been visited by a few sport fishermen.
The best angling for lake trout occurs in June and September. Twenty-five to 30-pound trout are abundant. MacKinnon's best is a 40-pounder, and a friend caught a 53-pounder at the lake a few years before there was a lodge.
At Ena, with the exception of a few small fish, usually in the five-pound range, that are kept for a shore lunch, all of the lake trout caught are quickly returned to the water. Angling is done only with lures.
MacKinnon requires lures with barbless hooks, those with the barbs of the point pinched or filed down. This aids hook removal and helps prevent damage to the fish. Caught in cold waters, the trout usually have no trouble swimming heartily away after being landed.
Ena Lake provides excellent fishing for northern pike, which are another popular Canadian game fish. These are the mainstays in July and August. They, too, are frequently caught in trophy proportions, from 18 to 26 pounds, and all are released alive.
Twenty anglers were at Ena Lake earlier this summer when I visited. They came from Chicago, Minneapolis, Ontario, Wichita, Kan., and New York. Many were already booked for a return engagement next year.
The catch-and-release policy was not an issue for any of those present. The weather was of greater concern. While the course of the weather was beyond their control, the future of the fishing was not.

HEADLINE: Science Fiction

BYLINE: By Gerald Jonas

 BODY:
These are tough times for science fiction, or at least that part of the genre set in the near future (the next hundred years or so). Whether they come across as prediction, satire or cautionary tale, stories about the near future must build on contemporary events in a plausible way or readers will have trouble suspending disbelief. When the Soviet Union and its bloc began to fission, the rules changed overnight: all stories featuring superpower rivalries -- which meant virtually all near-future stories -- were suddenly out of date.
Under the circumstances, one might think that science fiction writers, who have all of space and time to play with, would steer clear of the near future until some new world order takes shape and reduces the risks of premature obsolescence. But Norman Spinrad has always been a risk taker. His novel "Bug Jack Barron" was denounced in England for its blunt language; "The Iron Dream," his alternative-history novel "written" by the famous science fiction writer Adolf Hitler, was banned in Germany. And in "The Void Captain's Tale" Mr. Spinrad took a deadpan look at the ultimate in unsafe sex: orgasm-powered space travel. Now, with RUSSIAN SPRING (Bantam, $22.50), he tries, and instructively fails, to stay one step ahead of the headlines. 
 In Mr. Spinrad's near-future scenario, a strong, centrally governed Soviet Union has gone "European" and an increasingly isolated United States is turning into a "third-rate country." The trouble with this scenario is not so much that events have overtaken it (who is to say how history may swerve tomorrow?) but that Mr. Spinrad takes it so seriously.
What this 567-page book is really about is the old story of trust and betrayal: youthful dreams eyeball to eyeball with harsh reality. The dream is space travel, the betrayer is the United States of America. Jerry Reed, whose father fed him all the Haagen-Dazs he could eat the night the Apollo astronauts landed on the moon so that he would never forget, exiles himself to Paris to get a job with the only nonmilitary space program still extant. His wife, Sonya, is one of the "new Russians" working for Red Star, S.A., a hugely successful conglomerate also known as "USSR, Incorporated." Their son and daughter grow up in Paris, not sure which nationality to choose.
All of this might have made for an intriguing study of dreams deferred (and recycled) except that the principal characters never seem to change, even when their circumstances do. Jerry Reed's life turns out to be little more than a footnote to that bowl of Haagen-Dazs; he and his family get older without noticeably maturing, their principal virtue being a tenacious loyalty to one another. Mr. Spinrad might have had more time for character development had he not been so busy spelling out the geopolitical-socioeconomic details of an imaginary 21st century that makes little sense as either prediction, satire or cautionary admonition.
The thanklessness of trying to outguess history seems to get even Mr. Spinrad down after a while. Part of the fun of near-future stories is the local color: imaginative flights of fashion, clever twists on contemporary trends, fresh slang. What we get all too often in "Russian Spring" are standard-issue lists of objects and events: "There was a stove, a microwave oven, two old refrigerators, a big restaurant double sink piled high with dirty dishes and grimy pots, and a big redwood picnic table with two long backless redwood benches." It is as if Mr. Spinrad wanted to reassure us, and himself, that the winds of history have not swept everything away. Yet recent events would seem to suggest a different strategy: to keep pace with the march of time, travel light.
The title of Robert Silverberg's new novel, THE FACE OF THE WATERS (Bantam, $20), comes from Genesis: "And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters." In Mr. Silverberg's conceit, the waters are a world-encompassing ocean on a planet named Hydros that was once used as a human penal colony. The descendants of the original prisoners survive on small floating islands that obey the ocean currents. The humans share these islands with the intelligent Gillies, natives of Hydros who barely tolerate their presence. The waters themselves teem with ravenous forms of life that resemble the sea monsters found on old maps of Earth, the barely remembered home planet long since destroyed by a blast of "hard radiation" from its own sun.
When some of the humans learn that the Gillies fear and venerate an unusual island known in their language as "the face of the waters," they set sail in a fleet of ships to find out why. As Mr. Silverberg tells it, this quest is unabashedly mythic: there is a priest searching for God, a self-medicating doctor looking for love, a man of action looking for something to conquer, a woman searching for the truth and so on. But the people themselves are more than allegorical devices; their obsessions are believable, their pain all too real. The opening chapters set the scene with great economy and authority; the ending is both daring and persuasive. The problem comes in the middle, the quest-journey itself, which goes on and on and on, enlivened mainly by attacks from one terrifying monster after another.
Mr. Silverberg exercises considerable ingenuity in devising these creatures, but the exercise grows tedious and begins to look suspiciously like padding. Back in the 1940's and 50's, in the heyday of the science fiction magazine, editors welcomed stories of any length; if a story was too long to be called short and too short to be called a novel, it was published as a novelette or novella.
"Novelette" always sounded to me like something on sale at Woolworth's, but "novella" (which my dictionary defines as "a story with a compact and pointed plot") has been good English since the Renaissance. Many of science fiction's classic stories are novellas. Without its bloated middle, "The Face of the Waters" would have made a perfect novella; readers who don't mind skimming through the middle hundred pages or so may enjoy it as such.
R. A. MacAvoy's KING OF THE DEAD (Morrow, $19) is a worthy sequel to last year's "Lens of the World," the book that introduced Nazhuret, an orphan of uncertain birth but of many talents, including first-person narration; his equally adept lady companion, who goes by the masculine name of Arlin, and their omnicompetent mentor, Powl. As before, Nazhuret and Arlin are reluctant heroes, thrust into the medieval politics of a world where kings, nobles and priests toss the ball of power among themselves in a game that can turn deadly at any moment.
Since swords are the weapon of choice in this world and since supranormal mental powers play a part in the story, I suppose Ms. MacAvoy's novels can be labeled "sword and sorcery." But unlike most specimens of this subgenre, her story focuses on language, not action. Nazhuret is more likely to talk his way out of trouble than to fight, although when pressed he and Arlin kill with efficiency if not relish.
Ms. MacAvoy and her characters take such pleasure in words that it is hard not to be swept along by their windy rhetoric, even when it borders on bombast. Taking the measure of an uncertain ally, Nazhuret muses: "He's a slave, but he's the emperor's slave, and his humility is another man's arrogance." To cow a band of cutthroat nomads, he extemporizes an autobiographical oration that begins, "I was born on the edge of a knife." And to defuse a grandiloquent challenge from his worst enemy -- "But I warn you, treacherous tool, I will make no peace with darkness!" -- Nazhuret replies, as "inoffensively" as he knows how: "Why not, Minsanaur of Rezhmia? Every day does."

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL; ALAN COWELL is chief of the Rome bureau of The New York Times.

 BODY:
FLYING from Rome to Paris the other day, I fell into conversation with a Japanese teacher on vacation in Europe and we got to chatting about the cost of visiting what, for many Americans, has become a very expensive continent.
My curiosity had been inspired by the travel documents she had been arranging in a wallet -- hotel voucher from the superexpensive Grand Hotel in Florence, voucher for the Meridien in Paris, round-trip business class ticket from Osaka to London. Without going into detail, she said her outlays had been, well, significant. 
 A few days earlier I had been in Florence myself -- no lines at the galleries in these chill days. But the city was not empty. Tour groups braved the elements and the shopping, many of them Japanese, like the teacher, browsing and buying their way through leatherware and luggage and shoe stores. The story was the same when I got to Paris, where one of the biggest-name stores on the Rue du Faubourg St.-Honore was doing what seemed a very brisk trade in bulk purchases of $200 silk scarves.
The point, however, was not the nationality of the shoppers or even the fawning rapaciousness of the clerks, but in the curious imbalances of how the tourist dollar, or yen, or mark, is spread around the cities we visit: the money, ultimately, ends up with the restaurants and the stores and the hotels, even though we have come to see the statues and the architecture and the paintings. How much of our spending goes to preserving the very spectacles that drew us in the first place, and how much to those who profit from our interest?
During my own trip to Florence, I had spoken with Annamaria Patrioli Tofani, the director of the Uffizi, who had explained how Italy answered that question. The entrance fee at the Uffizi is around $8. A maximum of 7,000 visitors are permitted entry on each day the gallery is open. That makes a high-season average take of $56,000 a day, more than $1.6 million a month. Yet, the director said, she was having trouble finding the money to place screens of expensive, nonreflective glass in front of the Uffizi's prized Botticellis to protect them. The reason was that the gallery's income fed a government budget in Rome, from which funds were reallocated to individual museums and galleries. The reallocation, the director suggested, was not as generous as the contribution.
Some Florentines find it preposterous that a gallery like the Uffizi should be barred from self-financing, but, in a way, its problem reflects the wider quandary. Each year, five million tourists visit the city, and even if each of them spent only a museum fee that would mean $40 million flowing into the city. Yet some of the world's most famous paintings cannot be protected by anything other than a cheaper kind of glass that inhibits the viewer's appreciation of the masterpieces. And this is in a very wealthy place: "They talk about recession," said a public relations consultant in the city. "I don't see it here." If a wealthy spot like Florence has problems, what then of poorer places whose antiquity is just as much a part of our heritage?
Over the last few years, as a foreign correspondent, I've lived in three of the cities on the east Mediterranean tourist trail -- Athens, Cairo and Rome. In all three, I heard the argument that their treasures -- the Acropolis, the Pyramids, the Roman Forum, to name but the most celebrated -- are part of humanity's gift to itself. Yet, in each place, I've watched as the treasures fall prey largely to human folly: the Parthenon and the Forum awash in pollution, the tomb of Tutankhamun in upper Egypt closed to visitors because the visitors' own perspiration gnaws the frescoes; priceless sculpture in Rome and Florence assailed by deranged attackers; the Sphinx of Giza eroded from within by rising ground-water.
It was easy, as a resident, to become blase. The Pyramids became a backdrop to the nine-hole golf course and swimming pool beneath them. The Acropolis was no more than a point of navigation through the ocean of ugly concrete apartment houses that washes around it. And many local people did not seem too bothered about the antiquities, either: if every young Greek or Italian on a motorcycle was indifferent to the damage of exhaust fumes to a priceless heritage, and if every Egyptian hawker -- and quite a few public officials -- saw the Pyramids as no more than a concentration of potentially easy pickings, why should an outsider bother? If the antipollution measures in Rome and Athens are rarely enforced with complete efficiency, why get too steamed up about the damage that's being done?
The answer, of course, is that if there's no conservation, then, one day, there'll be nothing left to conserve and future generations will be the worse off for the disrespect the 20th century has paid to the collective scientific, cultural and artistic underpinnings of our self-image as civilized people.
Our own era's contributions -- the silicon chip and the video camera, for example -- seem a poor substitute. A computer might be able to duplicate Botticelli's "Venus" through advanced graphics or explain the construction of the Pyramids as a mathematical formula; but I doubt if it could generate the glorious inspiration behind them. It might convert the scientific accomplishment of the Renaissance or the philosophy of ancient Greece into a database. But it could not originate genius -- not yet, at least.
If the corollary is that we all have some responsibility for preservation, the question arises: how do we go about it? The germ of an idea began to form in a conversation, again in Florence, with the deputy mayor, Gianni Conti, who is also the senior municipal officer responsible for the city's cultural heritage. He said that 40 of the city's best-known monuments had secured sponsorship from local banks and businesses to insure their preservation. Why not take the idea further? Why not create taxation systems that take at least a slice of our tourist dollars from the stores and hotels and restaurants and divert them effectively to a broader form of sponsorship by the traders who reap most benefit from them?
The drawback is that money is only a small part of the solution: there are plenty of drachmas in Greece, after all, but the city's urban sprawl, its reliance on winter heating oil and cars creates a toxic environment far too complex for simple solutions. And, in Egypt, it is the very press of visitors, along with the country's myriad other problems, that create some of the most severe challenges for conservationists.
So, in the end, as the flight approached Paris and my companion packed away the guidebooks on Italy and began to peruse the map of France, I figured that, maybe, hers was the only practical solution: bite the bullet, see it now -- and hope it lasts.

Rating New York City as a Place for Doing Business

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
NEW YORK'S recovery is not around any corner that American business leaders can see. A new survey shows that two and a half times as many executives rated business conditions in the area "poor" this year as did in 1989.
All told, 47 percent of the chief executive officers who say they are familiar with New York believe that general business conditions make it a poor place to locate a business today, according to this year's "Business America Real Estate Monitor," conducted by Louis Harris & Associates for the Cushman & Wakefield real estate concern. 
 And only 11 percent say they believe that business conditions in New York will be better in a year's time, contrasted to 30 percent who said conditions would be worse. That is the gloomiest assessment offered by the executives for any one of the 32 cities covered by the survey.
Notwithstanding the unfavorable perception, however, the New York area is the locale cited by 11 percent of the executives who say that they are actually planning to acquire office space in the next year.
In that regard, it is ahead of every area but Los Angeles and San Francisco.
How to reconcile these findings?
While New York scores poorly in almost every other criterion that corporate leaders use in locating a business, it is still well regarded for the "easy access" it provides to markets, customers and clients -- an attribute judged by the executives to be the single most important.
When it comes to access, 37 percent of the executives believe New York is an excellent office location. Chicago is the only city that gets a higher mark in this vital category.
"Some companies and industries have to have a presence in New York," said James S. Vanderslice, a managing director of Cushman & Wakefield. "There may be things they don't like about New York, but to operate, they have to be in New York."
"Obviously, for the city, this is a good news-bad news story," said Carl Weisbrod, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation. "The good news is that New York's fundamental assets of access, transportation and the like are very strong. Ultimately, the economic health of an area is determined by those fundamentals.
"Given the importance of access to markets as a factor in business decisions," Mr. Weisbrod continued, "and underscoring how well New York does in that area, it's really essential for us to preserve, enhance and improve that asset. One of the areas we're concentrating on now is the regional transportation of goods and services."
At the top of this list is the construction of a 1.8-mile rail connector at Oak Point in the Bronx, part of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's ambitious public-works program. This would allow freight cars to roll from the Bronx to Queens and Long Island. Second on the list is the improvement of air-cargo handling at Kennedy International Airport.
So much for the good news. Only 7 percent of the executives in the survey believe the New York area is excellent when it comes to the cost and availability of labor. Only 11 percent believe the area is excellent for the cost and efficiency of office space.
One percent believes that the quality of life for employees is excellent in the New York area. (Only Detroit fared worse: zero.)
Finally, in the matter of the "climate state and local government creates for business through tax policy and the extent of regulation," not one executive answered "excellent" when it came to New York.
"There's a message for us that we're well aware of," Mr. Weisbrod said. "From time immemorial, New York has been perceived by business as a tough place to do business. It is incumbent on government to improve that perception and make it an easier place to do business. Obviously, a large component of 'climate' is taxes, but it's only one. We're trying to make the city more receptive."
In assessing the climate created by government, 44 percent of the executives rated it "poor," up from 41 percent last year and 22 the year before that. This coincided with the departure of Mayor Edward I. Koch and arrival of Mayor David N. Dinkins, but executives at Cushman & Wakefield believe it is just that: a coincidence.
"DINKINS is dealing with a lot of issues that he inherited," Mr. Vanderslice said. "If Koch were in office, he'd be dealing with the same issues today. It happens to be the timing of administrations."
"The issues that are becoming far more pronounced are budget deficits and where tax increases are going to hit," said David Gialanella, managing director of Cushman & Wakefield. "I think corporate New York is viewing itself as the recipient of any move to increase revenues by increasing taxes."
Cost -- not civic deterioration -- may explain why New York's overall rating, which had been slipping in the late 80's, now seems to plummet from year to year.
"If you look at New York from purely a cost standpoint, it is significantly -- I underline significantly -- more expensive," Mr. Gialanella said. "You have a corporate base whose emphasis is on boosting earnings by reducing costs, so it doesn't surprise me that the problems they perceive in New York might be a little more prevalent now than they have been in the past."
"Are we worse in fact -- as a business center -- by the margin that the poll reflects?" asked Warren Wechsler, first senior vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York. "I don't see the evidence to explain any change in our standing other than perhaps a more deeply ingrained pessimism that's come about as a result of an economy that is stubbornly mired in the worst recession in recent memory.
"I think it is more a reflection of mood than it is a valid assessment of the city's assets as a business center," Mr. Wechsler said.
"HOW many of those executives live in New York? Are they speaking from firsthand knowledge or from what they hear and read in a press that's known to be robust, critical and searching and from a civic community that places a very high demand on those who govern?"
The answer to Mr. Wechsler's question is known only to Louis Harris & Associates, which will not reveal it even to Cushman & Wakefield, for whom the survey was conducted. "They keep to their vest anything that would be remotely construed as getting into the sample," Mr. Gialanella said.
Because of that, it is impossible to conduct follow-up interviews, as The New York Times does in reporting its own poll results.
All that Louis Harris will reveal about those who passed judgment on New York is that they amount to 55 percent of the 400 chief executive officers or their designees who were interviewed.
In the overall sample, 36 percent of those surveyed were from the East, 24 percent from the Midwest, 23 percent from the South and 17 percent from the West. Nearly half -- 46 percent -- represented companies with revenues of less than $500 million. On the other end, 18 percent represented companies with revenues of $1.5 billion or more.
Executives in finance, insurance and real estate accounted for 26 percent of the sample. Manufacturers accounted for 25 percent and wholesalers for 24 percent.
It is worth noting that even among those cities that rank ahead of New York, there has been slippage in recent years.
Atlanta now tops Cushman & Wakefield's list of "Best Places to Locate a Business Today," as it has for five of the last six years. But the number of executives giving it an excellent rating has dropped to 24 percent this year, from 39 percent in 1988.
"Excellent" ratings for Los Angeles have sunk to 4 percent from 19 percent over that same period. Boston has seen a drop to 4 percent from 21 percent. Philadelphia has gone to 3 percent, from 10 percent.

HEADLINE: In This Buyers' Market The Buyers Are Edgy

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
NEALE S. Godfrey fretted before she bought a six-room apartment on the Upper West Side last summer and she is fretting still. Yet she is a pro in weighing economic risks -- a former bank president, the author of a children's book on money management, the host of a radio talk show on personal finance. And the apartment was the third home she had bought.
Moreover, with the price at only $238,000 and the mortgage carrying a 7.5 percent adjustable interest rate, the real estate market hadn't looked so inviting to her since the late 70's. 
 Ms. Godfrey, however, is one of the many prospective and recent home buyers who are in a dither over whether the sour economy will erase the real gains offered by today's sweet real estate opportunities.
To be sure, many families are enthusiastically buying houses and apartments at what they believe are rock-bottom prices and interest rates. But economic uncertainty and a lack of consumer confidence are keeping others from entering the market and unnerving those who have.
Ms. Godfrey, for example, said she had qualms about the impact of the recession on the apartment's investment value and her fledgling consulting and marketing business. She also worried that banks might look askance at a self-employed single parent -- she has a 5-year-old son and a daughter, 8 -- who was already carrying a mortgage on another home.
In fact, her anxiety was even greater than when she bought a house in suburban New Jersey during the Middle East oil crisis in the early 70's or in an explosively inflating market in 1985. "It was much greater," Ms. Godfrey said, adding: "People are very apprehensive about buying. But it has more to do with their own economic circumstances than with real estate values."
Considering the current buyer's market in residences, it might seem that sellers, troubled by falling prices, job insecurities and a glut of homes for sale, would feel the most trepidation.
BUYER anxiety, though, appears to be just as commonplace. And it may even be more prevalent than in previous years when, because of rapidly rising prices and interest rates, buying a home was, for most people, a more daunting proposition.
Donna and Marc Centrelli are to close on a three-bedroom colonial in Ridgewood, N.J., on Jan. 15. Deciding whether to move has been "a much more anxious time" than when they they were looking for their first house, said Mrs. Centrelli.
The couple recently sold that first house -- a two-bedroom-plus-office home in Fair Lawn, N.J., bought as a handyman special for $162,500 two years ago and sold for $180,000. They made no major renovations.
"The main reason is the economy," Mrs. Centrelli said. "My husband is self-employed; he's a chiropractor. We're confident in his ability to increase his practice, but we are also anxious about how everyone is tightening their belts. The first time we bought, he hadn't even started his practice, but we were not as anxious as we are now."
No studies exist that measure buyer anxiety, but the phenomenon may be reflected in the drop in resales of one-family homes in the Northeast, from 703,000 in 1986 to 522,000 in 1990. The pattern also seems to be getting worse: The seasonally adjusted annual rate has fallen for each of the last four months, hitting 490,000 in October.
"There is a fear out there," said William F. Higgins, owner of the Higgins Agency, a 50-year-old real estate brokerage in Hillsdale, N.J. "The buyer today isn't asking about interest rates, but he is asking himself whether he is going to have a job and be able to make the payments. When you hear that I.B.M., Big Blue, is going to lay off 20,000 people, it kind of shakes your confidence."
Even more telling, perhaps, are the national monthly surveys of 5,000 households by the Conference Board of Manhattan, a nonprofit business research organization. They show that the number of American families planning to buy a new home within six months has, for the most part, been falling since January 1987, when it stood at 4.4 percent of the households.
The percentage has also declined for each of the last four months, hitting 2.7 in November. That was the lowest since last January, when it was 2.6 percent. The percentages are part of the Conference Board's overall Consumer Confidence Index, which in November fell to a level lower than the lowest reading registered in the recession of 1981-82.
"Consumer confidence in housing is down -- not to an 11-year low, but it is down," said Fabian Linden, executive director of the Conference Board's consumer research center.
Indeed, these are tense times for home buyers, brokers, builders and sellers. Sale prices in the Northeast, in defiance of the old "it-can-only-go-up" axiom, have been falling for two years, making many shoppers and new home owners wonder about the real worth of real estate.
National Association of Realtors figures show that the median price of a one-family home fell from $145,200 in 1989 to $141,200 last year. This year the price dropped from $143,500 in July to $136,700 in October.
J. I. Sopher, the owner of J.I. Sopher & Company, a realty management and consulting firm in Manhattan, estimated that half of the tenants of the Lucerne, a new Upper East Side apartment building, are renters who could and would like to buy a home.
"But they don't know what the bottom of the market is, whether they will be in business tomorrow or what their taxes or assessements will be," he said. "There is more anxiety in the real estate market today than there has been in the history of civilization."
Michael Kanbar, an importer-exporter who lives in the Lucerne, is an example of someone who is hesitant about buying an apartment or house. "I can't decide," he said. "There are some increasing real estate taxes now, and I believe they are are going to be increased again, and that worries me. The overhead is going to be restrictive."
"I also may not live here forever," he said. "You don't have to be based in New York anymore with communications what they are. So in the meantime I'm renting, because I don't know what's happening."
The recent drop in interest rates is generally seen as a strong enticement to buy. The national average for a 30-year adjustable-rate mortgage has fallen from a high of 12.05 percent in July 1984 to 6.44 percent in November, according to HSH Associates in Butler, N.J. The annual interest on a 30-year, fixed mortgage has dropped from 14.74 percent in July 1984 to 8.8 percent in November.
SOME analysts, though, such as Alan Yassky, president of Rockland Realty in Spring Valley, N.Y., and a past regional vice president of the National Realtors Association, have speculated that a declining rate, paradoxically, may dissuade, or at least delay, purchases.
"It is not anxiety as much as a lack of urgency," he said. "As long as interest rates keep coming down, there is that feeling that they may continue to go lower, and the buyer can wait. If the rates went up by 1.5 points then the real estate market would overheat. They would say, 'I had better get in because the rates have hit bottom and now they are moving back up.' "
Nevertheless, low interest rates and falling prices have made an American family's ability to buy a house rise to its highest level in almost 15 years, according to the National Association of Realtors. That group's housing affordability index stood at 118.8 in October, the most recent month for which statistics have been compiled. It was up 2.5 points from 116.3 in September and the highest since March 1977, when it hit 120.7.
An index of 118.8 means that a family earning the national median income of $36,473 had 118.8 percent of the income needed to qualify for a conventional 80 percent mortgage on a home priced at the national median: $99,200.
In the Northeast region, the October index rose 4.8 percentage points from the previous month, to 94.8. That means that a family earning $43,373 had 94.8 percent of the income needed to qualify to buy the median-priced home at $136,700. The index shows that the gap between incomes and the cost of housing is narrowing in the region but still cuts more families out of the home market than in the nation as a whole.
The rate of interest used to compute the index in October -- 9.02 percent, down from 9.17 a month before -- was derived from a report by the Federal Housing Finance Board of closing rates of fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages on existing homes.
"There is an anxiety level out there that is not in accord with the shape of the economy," said David Feldman, a sociologist who has studied the real estate market and also served as the dean of the business school at United States International University in San Diego. "The problem today is lack of faith."
Every buyer must make his own guess at how prices will move, and many are optimistic. One is Jeremy Barbera, the president of a direct-mail marketing company, who is to close Wednesday on a two-bedroom apartment in a brownstone at 70th Street and Central Park West. He paid $325,000. "I think the market has bottomed out, at least in this area" he said.
Fred H. Steckhahn, a vice president of marketing and sales for a health-care company who is looking for a two- or three-bedroom apartment in the Sutton Place or Beekman Place neighborhoods of Manhattan, is equally confident. "If you are going to stay for a while, I don't see how you can go wrong," he said.
He also said that he and his companion are being very patient in their search. "We're looking for a bargain," he said. "If there is anxiety for us, it is whether to buy a wreck and fix it up or go top of the line."
"There is a lot of tire-kicking going on," said Dick Herbert, a broker with William Raveis realty in Greenwich, Conn. "People are taking a lot of things into consideration beyond a look-see and talking to a broker."
Some real estate brokers dismissed buyer anxiety or downplayed it as ordinary caution. "I think there is less anxiety out there, certainly less than was there was two years ago," said Sue W. Kamm, a broker with the William Pitt realty company in Fairfield, Conn. "The corner has been turned."
"People who are buying now are pretty savvy financially -- they know the economic cycles," added Clark P. Halstead, managing partner of the Halstead Property Company in Manhattan. "As J.P. Morgan once said about economic conditions, 'One thing is for sure -- they will change.' "
FOR those still sitting on the fence, though, such sentiments sound like the relentless "now-is-a-good-time-to-buy" boosterism of professionals whose livelihood depends on selling homes. The elderly, in particular, according to studies conducted by Sanford R. Goodkin, a real-estate analyst with the Peat Marwick accounting firm, seem to be the most anxious group when it comes to buying a new home.
"The empty-nester and the retiree have bought homes to preserve the nest egg," Mr. Goodkin said, "but now they are thinking twice because it may turn out to the opposite or they are reading reports that it may be the opposite."
It is not just skepticism about the market or a collapse in confidence about the economy that is slowing sales, however. Many would-be buyers are simply intimidated by banks' stricter credit requirements.
"Why bother -- why go through the hassle?" said Ms. Godfrey, who is 40 years old and served as the president of First Women's Bank from 1985 to 1988. "It is very difficult to get scrutinized to that extent and be turned down, and people are scared to death of being turned down."
There are no statistics available that compare how many mortgage applications have been rejected each year by all lenders. Such data were compiled for the first time in 1990 as part of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act. They showed rejection rates of 16.6 percent for conventional loans, 16.9 percent for Federal Housing Administration loans, 15 percent for the Veterans Administration and 20 percent for the Farmers Home Administration. Though lenders are quick to note that the much-ballyhooed "credit crunch" is affecting mostly commercial development, they also concede that approval for a loan on an existing home is more difficult than in recent years.
"As a general rule, on residential loans it is a little tighter," said Robert M. O'Toole, senior staff vice president for residential finance at the Mortgage Bankers of America in Washington. "I certainly wouldn't call it a residential credit crunch, but I'd call it a bit of a belt tightening."
Beside fear of rejection, home buyers are often frozen out of the market because they are also sellers who need to unload their own home to complete a deal but won't set a realistic price. "It gets difficult for them to get out of their house," said Richard B. Peiser, dean of the Lusk Center for Real Estate Development at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. "They don't want to take a loss."
Then there is the so-called "domino effect." This angst-producing phenomenon occurs when buyer A needs to sell a home to buyer B to complete a deal but can't because buyer B backed out, sometimes because B was selling a home to buyer C, who backed out, and so on.
Mr. Higgins said that such a scenario, the last-minute nightmare of many home buyers, had occurred recently to a couple in Ho-Ho-Kus, N.J.
"It was a three-level collapse," he said. "They were upset, to say the least."

HEADLINE: Talking: Co-op Sales;
Avoiding Rejection Litigation

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
WHEN the New York City co-op market started to shake out in the late 1980's, admissions policies were expected to become more relaxed to accommodate struggling sellers.
Moreover, many legislative proposals introduced in the State Assembly to require boards to give reasons for the rejection of a buyer -- and thus make it harder to do so -- were expected to become law. 
 Neither has happened. State and local laws still let boards reject an applicant without giving a reason -- provided it is done in good faith and not because of legally prohibited discrimination based on race, creed, color, national origin, lawful occupation, citizenship status, age, sexual orientation or the presence of children.
Only if the seller or buyer sues the corporation or files a complaint of discrimination with the Human Rights Commission must reasons for the refusal be revealed, said Morton H. Rosen, a lawyer who has handled many such cases.
Brokers report that in some instances it has become even harder to get a prospective buyer approved. A major cause has been a rise in the number of shareholders not making timely maintenance payments.
Barbara Corcoran, president of the Corcoran Group, a Manhattan real estate agency, said more boards are scrutinizing the reliability, as well as size, of a family's income. "They're much more comfortable if someone has a salary from a large corporation than if they're getting most of their money from bonuses or commissions," she said.
Some assets, such as other real estate, don't carry as much weight as substantial liquid assets, she added.
Even so, boards must be aware that the rejection of a prospective buyer is increasingly likely to result in a suit, irrespective of the reason, because the desperate sellers are more likely to face substantial losses in contrast to the old days when they might have got even more from a subsequent buyer.
Moreover, boards have a fiduciary responsibility to the sellers as shareholders, which they do not have to buyers, said Mr. Rosen.
Consider Straus v. 345 East 73d Street Owners Corporation, currently before the Appellate Division. William A. Straus, the former owner of a one-bedoom apartment at the Upper East Side building is claiming he lost $82,000 because his original buyer was rejected without lawful cause and it took him eight months longer to sell. The co-op claims justification on the ground that the buyer had refused to abide by the co-op's limitations on the maximum number of permitted occupants. A lower court upheld Mr. Straus' argument, but the co-op has appealed.
Consider, also, the potential suit that arrived on the desk of Errol Brett, a Manhattan lawyer, recently and that is to be filed against an East Side co-op by a seller who says that three prospective buyers -- all of whom he insists were financially qualified -- were turned down when they tried to buy his $1.3 million apartment. As a result, the unit has been on the market more than a year and each time someone makes a bid the negotiated price falls a little more. The seller claims that all three applicants were rejected because they had children.
All of which leaves an admissions committee walking a thin line trying to protect its co-op at a time of economic stress while seeking to avoid potential suits by sellers.
Under such difficult circumstances lawyers suggest several strategies. Mr. Brett advises his co-op clients to give a reason each time they reject anyone so there is less room for misinterpreration or festering resentment. But he also warns them not to be paranoid over finances since lenders are getting more restrictive, too. If a lender has approved a loan, he said, it is unlikely the applicant is as marginal as the board might suspect.
FURTHER, he warned against acquiring a reputation among brokers as a "difficult" building since this could affect other shareholders trying to sell. And this could lead to even more trouble collecting maintenance in future if the sellers run into financial diffficulties or abandon their apartments.
When in doubt about the financial stability of a potential buyer, he said, a board might be consider seeking auxiliary assurances. These could include asking a buyer to put a year or two's maintenance in escrow or to have the contract or an agreement co-signed by a better-heeled parent or other relative.
Lawyers say admissions committees should still feel free to ask "life style" questions.
"You can still ask someone if they would be able to serve on a board," said Mr. Rosen, who represents 85 buildings. "Or if they will be using the apartment for parties on a regular basis?. Or even what kind of pet they have and whether they might need to sublet a lot."
A small brownstone co-op with a limited number of potential volunteers, he said, would have a perfect right to reject someone who clearly had no time to serve.
However, a co-op could run afoul of the state's 1983 roommate law, he warned, if someone was turned down because the applicant admitted that a "friend" might also be occupying the unit. Thus he advises checking with a lawyer before providing any reason for rejection.
Sellers, meanwhile, should not remain passive onlookers. They can also help the applicant by learning more about the attitude of their admissions committee and trying to help the seller deflect or overcome any difficulties in advance.
Nathan Fridman, president of Nu-Place Realty of Kew Gardens, Queens, finds that buyers who have never owned a co-op may object to some questions as too intrusive. "They need to be carefully prepared," he said, "or they could become curt or angry during the interview." This in itself could become a reason for rejection, he warned, noting that nobody likes to have someone around who is antisocial or a possible troublemaker.
Ms. Corcoran said it was common for sellers not to list all their assets when first requested to do so by the board -- and for boards to reach a conclusion based on the assumption that everything had been committed to paper. And once a decision is reached it is virtually impossible to have the matter reopened. Thus sellers might delicately make the point that withholding mention of certain assets might make a critical difference between acceptance and rejection -- especially when boards remain so concerned about solvency.

 BODY:

Transferring Rent Rights
 
Question: A new Chinese restaurant opened in an annex of my building. A large ventilation system has been installed on the roof directly in front of my kitchen windows. The noise and smells make me nauseous and give me headaches. The new landlord has offered to move me to another apartment in the building. Would I lose my status as a rent-controlled tenant if I moved? . . . Estelle Kochan, Manhattan 
 Answer: No. According to Joseph D'Agosta, an assistant commissioner with the state's Division of Housing and Community Renewal, the agency would recognize any voluntary agreement between you and your landlord maintaining your rent-control status.
"The tenant could continue as a rent-controlled tenant with the same rent and rights and protections," said Mr. D'Agosta.
If you decide to move, make sure there is a written agreement affirming the maintenance of your rent status beforehand. A copy of this agreement should be sent to the housing agency so that it can change its records and also to protect your situation in case of a dispute. It should be sent to Rohan James, Individual Owner Unit, Gertz Plaza, 92-31 Union Hall Street, Jamaica, N.Y. 11433.
 
Problem With Pigeons
 
Question: We are having a serious problem with pigeons that goes beyond the way our building looks. We believe it is a serious health threat. Is there a way to clean up the problem that is legal and inexpensive? . . . Robert McGill, Flushing, Queens
 
Answer: Yes, but extermination is not an option because it is against the law to kill pigeons. You can set traps so they can be moved to another location or you can discourage roosting and feeding by using a repellent or barrier.
"It is also important to find the cause of the problem," said Edward Boyce, director of Veterinary Public Health Services for the city's Health Department. "It might be that someone in the area is feeding the birds, which is against the law."
Pigeon removal services can be found in the Yellow Pages under bird repellents and controls. For more information call the Health Department's general information number: 212-285-9503.
 
Building Air Vents
 
Question: My 30-year-old high-rise building was built with vents instead of windows in the kitchens and bathrooms. These vents are connected by ducts to rooftop exhaust fans. Due to complaints about excessive wind noise -- especially on the high floors -- the exhaust fans are turned off between midnight and 5 A.M. Is this permissible under New York City law? . . . George Steinberg, Brooklyn
 
Answer: Only in part. According to Roz Post, a spokeswoman for the Department of Housing Preservation and Development, the city has rules specifying the times that vents can be turned off. The vents that operate in kitchens must be open 24 hours but the vents that circulate air in bathrooms may be shut down from midnight to 6 A.M.
 
Hallway Smoke Detectors
 
Question: Tenant shareholders in our co-op have written to the board because we want to install smoke detectors on each apartment floor. There has been no response after 18 months. Can we install them ourselves? . . . Nadine Keller, Flushing, Queens
 
Answer: No. You would need the permission of the board to make additions or changes in the building's common areas. According to John J. Hodgens, acting chief for fire prevention for the Fire Department, the law requires that there be a at least one smoke detector in each dwelling unit. Detectors are not mandated for the corridors of apartment buildings but Chief Hodgens said that they would provide an extra measure of safety against fires that originate in corridors and stairwells.

For Churches, the Bells Now Toll 'Build'

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
MENTION Connecticut and a town green comes to mind, complete with a pristine white clapboard church at one end, its spire rising above other buildings. Its simplicity bespeaks the old New England virtues of piety, modesty and thrift.
Most of these churches are Congregational and the parishes date to the 17th century, when church and state were intertwined. To form a town, settlers first had to form a church. Today there are 270 Congregational churches in 168 of Connecticut's 169 towns. (only Waterford is without one). 
 Along with other denominations, dozens of them are starting building programs to accommodate growth in income-producing outreach programs, increased Sunday school enrollments for baby-boomer children and historic preservation.
In typical New England fashion, they are seizing the opportunity to do so at a time when costs are down, and in the process they are providing architects and construction workers with much-needed income.
"Any buyer of such services is not going to find a better time to go forward than now," said Charles Grove, executive director of the Associated General Contractors of Connecticut in Wallingford. "Bids are coming in at 10 percent less than estimated costs."
Churches seem able to raise money in spite of the economic downturn, according to Frederick Biebesheimer, architect for a $200,000 addition to the Ledyard Congregational Church, built in 1740. "They obtain pledges from parishioners," he said. The pledges serve as collateral for bank loans and are due in three to five years. "Banks look favorably on church loans because they rarely default," he said.
"All the major buildings in Old Lyme were built during recessions," said Audrey Philcox, associate minister of the town's Congregational Church. Its 800 members will vote this month on plans for a $1.5 million addition and renovation. "We have outgrown our Sunday school space, and the auditorium only holds about 11 percent of the congregation," she said.
Founded in 1665, the church has been rebuilt four times as a result of fires or growth. The last reconstruction, in 1907, cost about $50,000, divided among 187 parishioners who paid $270 each. The cost per member for current renovations will be $1,870.
Current church school expansion follows a pattern of public school expansion over the last three years at the elementary level. "People are having children again," said the Rev. Fred Coulter of the Ledyard Congregational Church. "Our Sunday school has tripled in size."
While population shifts from southwestern Connecticut into the rest of the state account for increases in some congregations, church membership statewide is static, according to the Connecticut Council of Churches in Hartford, but outreach programs are growing.
"Churches are learning that a building used only a couple of days a week is not cost-effective," said Susan Chandler, historical architect of the Connecticut Historical Commission in Hartford. "They are opening up to Alcoholics Anonymous, community day care, soup kitchens, homeless accommodations, concerts, lectures and sharing space with minority congregations with no facilities."
The need for physical facilities has generated a marked increase in calls to Ms. Chandler and Judy Edwards, executive vice president of the Connecticut Society of Architects, from churches planning additions.
Richard Bergmann, a New Canaan architect, is designing a 10,000-square-foot-addition to St. Peter's Lutheran Church in Norwalk, doubling its space at an estimated cost of $1.5 million. He recently completed a renovation at the Noroton Presbyterian Church in Darien, where a chapel was provided for a Korean Presbyterian congregation that had no home of its own.
IN New Milford, the 158-year-old Congregational Church on the Green is seeking to raise $800,000 to rebuild the deteriorating steeple and to bring the building up to current codes for fire, safety and access for the disabled. At least $200,000 of that is to be raised among townspeople who are not members of the congregation, on the premise that the church is a historic landmark and an important community asset.
In Middletown, $675,000 was raised to restore the steeple of South Church, built in 1860. "If it isn't fixed, you will be looking at an uglier Main Street," was the admonition used last year to whip up community support by Ann Street, director of the Greater Middletown Preservation Trust. She organized a conference on stewardship of historic religious properties, which 140 people from around the state attended on Nov. 2.
To prepare for it, she visited several churches, which she described as "huge physical plants with gross underutilization of space, or if used, not paying their way." Churches, she said, "feel they must offer space free to anyone who wants to use it."
"Maybe they get a $35 fee," she said, "which doesn't begin to cover janitorial services, heat and electricity."
Putting a day-care center into a historical building, she continued, "requires more than buying a bunch of toys."
"There are codes and regulations regarding parking, egress, handicap access, fire safety," she said. "Ninety percent of the people who use churches for other than religious purposes don't pay anything toward support of the property."
The laws governing church and state probably need rethinking, Ms. Street concluded. "Churches may need to operate some facilities as profit centers," she said. "It may be a reasonable trade-off to having churches pay some taxes."
In Stamford, St. John's Episcopal Church receives a substantial six-figure income on the lease of its land to Canterbury Green, a residential and office complex built in the mid-1980's.
"The money helps us survive," said Craig Ferguson, former church treasurer. Its tax-exempt status is preserved by limiting use of the funds to maintenance of church property and social programs.
Doreen Fundiller-Zweig, a tax specialist at the Hartford law firm of Robinson & Cole, said that "many tax-exempt institutions such as hospitals and universities set up taxable affiliates engaged in activities that provide income for the institutions."
"The leasing of land by churches is looked upon by the Internal Revenue Service as a passive, tax-exempt investment," she said. "If churches engage in taxable, profit-making ventures they may be perceived by existing businesses as unfair competition because of their tax exemptions. Nevertheless, I think this is the trend."

HEADLINE: DINING OUT;
Savory French Fare Unseats Nouvelle

BYLINE: By PATRICIA BROOKS

 BODY:
IT has been four years since Bertrand first opened its doors in Greenwich. At the time the food was often ambrosial, and our major caveat was about service lapses that seemed surprising in a place otherwise so professional. Recently we decided to venture back to see how this excellent French restaurant, whose prices were in the expense account stratosphere, was faring in these difficult economic times.
Superficially, nothing has changed. The restaurant is as sparklingly well-kept as it was when opened. The restaurant, which is in a building dating from 1917, has an interior that blends brick columns and arches with vaulted ceilings of golden-toned Guastavino ceramic tiles as well as apricot-hued walls, brass sconces emitting soft lighting, polished brass railings leading to the most appealing second tier dining area and mirrors with ornate bronzed frames. Banks of fresh chrysanthemums separate two sections of the upper level, and fresh flowers are on each impeccably groomed table. An atrium on the lower dining level makes this a good lunchtime choice. 
 The French menu is as appetite sparking as ever, though the imaginative flourishes of its former nouvelle creativity seem to have given way to slightly more predictable classic fare. As for service, it was prompt and flawless except for the server who brought our entrees and had to ask who got each dish.
We were also surprised that the long list of special appetizers and entrees was recited, with detailed descriptions of each dish. Where is the printed list of daily specials so many other fine restaurants have adopted?
As for the food, there were almost no misses, from the mildly spiced sausage en croute served before dinner, to the bite-size petits fours served with coffee at meal's end. In between we savored a starter of cassolette of bay scallops with basil, tomatoes and garlic in a succulently herbed sauce. Another cassolette, of crabmeat and shrimp with saffron and coriander, was equally savory. As a cold hors d'oeuvre, nothing topped the terrine of superlative foie gras -- a rosy, exquisitely textured and flavored slice, with its own gelee, served with a slice of duck pate en croute and its natural gelee. A rousing $20, it justified the splurge.
Also worth attention was a terrine of herbed goat cheese, served with lightly mixed salads. Only the lasagna of tuna was questionable; one of the layers of fish, alternating with the al dente pasta, was suspiciously strong.
The entrees we tried were all first-rate -- as well they should be at Bertrand prices, which hover at or near the top of the dining scale (though portions seem larger than in the past).
Among the entrees, veal chop stuffed with wild mushrooms and spinach in a sauce of natural juices, accompanied by pureed sweet potatoes, was expertly prepared, as was roast saddle of rabbit sliced into attractive ovals, each piece adorned with fresh basil and chopped tomato, served with a cake of grilled noodles rife with wild mushrooms. Civet of venison was a classic, a ragout of venison chunks, tiny potato rounds and onions, plus several kinds of mushrooms, in a luscious red wine sauce. Confit of duck in a peppercorn sauce, served with wild rice, was as perfect as we remembered it.
Desserts are almost de rigueur at Bertrand. In addition to a memorable passion fruit souffle (one of six hot souffles that must be ordered at the same time as dinner) there was a splendid warm apple tart in a chocolate-flecked caramel sauce. Chocolate shortcake in a delectible pistachio sauce, profligate with chopped nuts and chocolate swirls, was also a triumph, but a plate of sorbets made on the premises more than held its own and made a refreshing finale to a substantial meal. The raspberry, passion fruit and cassis flavors were intense, enhanced by fresh raspberries, strawberries and slices of honeydew melon.
A three-course dinner for two came to $103.50 before tax, tip and drinks. The wine list, with selections from French and American vineyards, is well-chosen and fairly priced. Though Bertrand is expensive, it is as exemplary as when it opened in 1987. Bertrand has two four-course prix-fixe theme dinners, on Dec. 19 ($38) and Dec. 26 ($40); such prices are an attempt to cope, no doubt, with the current economy.

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY;
Rush Hour Fees Urged for Flights

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
There may be slightly fewer rush-hour flights and consequently fewer and shorter delays -- at some major airports following the Transportation Department's suggestion last month that congested airports impose surcharges on planes using the runways at the busiest times of day. The question for travelers is whether the new guidelines will also mean much higher ticket prices for those who take off or land at busy times of day.
The department's proposed "peak hour" surcharges would mainly affect flights in the early morning and early evening. The idea is that the high costs would encourage airlines to divert flights to other time slots, smoothing out the flow of traffic and cutting down on delays. Officials said that even shifting a handful of flights can make a substantial difference in delays. 
 The department is not requiring this change. It is merely outlining for airports what kinds of charges would not be viewed as discriminatory or as impeding interstate commerce and thus be acceptable to the Government. Some airports officials have said that only the assumption of Government opposition was preventing them from imposing rush-hour charges.
Because the fees would be divided among hundreds of passengers on large jets, according to Clifford Winston, an airline economist at the Brookings Institution who has advocated such charges, they might amount to only $10 a ticket, probably not enough to make those customers change their flying times. After all, as the airlines point out, ticket prices already tend to be discounted in nonpeak periods.
But when applied to small planes, such as those used by commuter airlines, the fees might prevent flying at rush hour, Mr. Winston said. For most private pilots and users of corporate jets, the extra fees would be prohibitive. With the smaller planes out of the way, he said, the flow of heavier jets should be much smoother.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Can a Rebound Turn Into a Rally?

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
In recent years, investors in the United States have increasingly been advised to diversify their portfolios by buying stocks overseas. But Americans who invested abroad at the beginning of 1991 probably are finding it would have been better to keep the money at home.
Most of the bad news for overseas investors occurred very late in the year, although some stock markets seemed to be bouncing off the bottom last week, in the wake of a rally on Wall Street. 
 In London, the Financial Times index of 100 leading stocks rose 71.4 points, or 3 percent, on Thursday and Friday. And in Tokyo, where the Nikkei index of 225 leading stocks closed just points above its 1991 low on Wednesday, the index climbed 1,042.33 points, or 4.8 percent, on Friday. Stock markets also rallied in Norway, where the market hit three-year lows at the beginning of the month, and even in Germany, which has been stubbornly sluggish most of the year.
Looking back, the undoing of the Soviet Union has sent ripples though stock markets all year. The Persian Gulf War turned out to be a help, pulling markets out of the slide that began with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
But the expectations for a moderate economic recovery in the United States turned out to be overly optimistic. The disappointing American growth, in turn, seemed to heighten the worry about the faster-than-expected slowdowns in economies abroad. And though stock markets generally do not slavishly follow Wall Street's lead, it seems they are waiting for a signal from that source now.

 According to the Financial Times world index, European markets as a whole are up just 4.1 percent in dollar terms since the beginning of the year. Japan is up only 5.9 percent, even with Friday's surge.
Investors who decided a year ago to keep their money at home seem smart now, with the American market up 17.5 percent in the world index.
The only markets really revving up have been outliers, like Mexico, which is up 109.5 percent; Hong Kong, up 40.4 percent; South Africa, up 36.0 percent; Singapore, up 29.4 percent, and Australia, up 25.6 percent. They have been propelled by factors distinct to their own economies, and some have been good choices for American investors because their currencies are tied directly to the dollar, so they were not hurt by fluctuations in that currency.
Investing overseas looked a lot easier earlier in the year, even though the dollar was stronger and world markets suffered a sharp downturn in January as the deadline for the Persian Gulf War approached. In the first 16 days of the year, European markets fell 6.7 percent, on top of a decline of more than 18 percent between Aug. 2, 1990, the day of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, and the end of last year, according to the Financial Times index.
But by early March, the euphoria over the success of the Allied effort in the Persian Gulf had helped to push the Financial Times index of European markets up 12.6 percent in dollar terms, the high for the year. In September, the European markets hit their 1991 high in local currencies: a gain of 20.6 percent through Sept. 2.
Japan's market reached its high point in dollar terms in February, up 17.8 percent, and in local terms, up 17.1 percent, in March.
As a whole, the Financial Times's index of world markets is up 10.4 percent in dollar terms so far this year. But that is just two thirds of what the gain was when the index reached its high for the year just over a month ago, right before the American market took its big tumble on Nov. 15.
The lost gains seem even more dramatic in terms of local stock market indexes, which are in the home currency and have a different blend of stocks than the Financial Times index. By this measure all the stock markets in the Group of Seven are below their highs by about 50 percent or more -- except in the United States.
In Germany, the Dax index of 30 leading shares is up 11.5 percent for the year, after rallying to a 23 percent gain at its high. In Canada, the Toronto index of 300 shares is up only 3.2 percent after an 11 percent high. In Japan, the market was up 14 percent at its peak but then was down 10 percent until the Friday rally, which leaves it down 4.6 percent for the year. The CAC index of 40 shares in France has fallen sharply recently and is now up 11.2 percent for the year after reaching a peak gain of 24 percent.
In Britain, the FT-SE 100 index reached an all-time high in September, putting it up 25 percent for the year. But that gain has now shrunk to 14.4 percent. In Italy, the 20 percent gain seen in June has evaporated. The Banca Commerciale Italiana index is now down 4.6 percent for the year.
For the American investing abroad, the dollar's performance has been important. Its rise against European currencies contributed to the lackluster performance there. But it fell against the yen, helping turn losses into gains. And if the dollar, which was up about 25 percent against the German mark this year, had not fallen sharply recently, the small gains would probably have been losses.
In Europe, the dollar is still up about 10 percent against the mark and that was enough to cut the stock gains, when they are translated back into dollars, to 4.1 percent in dollars from 10.6 percent in local terms by the end of last week.
Right now, the outlook for next year is not great. While the recent declines would suggest there are bargains available, the list of negatives is hard to ignore. Among the problems: high interest rates in Europe and no likelihood of an easing soon; worries about the recovery in Britain and the United States and the slowdowns elsewhere in Europe and in Japan; downgrades in estimates of corporate earnings almost everywhere because of the sour economies, and worries about the course of events in the former Soviet Union, which have a dramatic impact in Germany.
In addition, there is the dollar. If the American economy does begin to recover and confidence rebounds, the dollar is likely to begin to rise again. And that would cut into profits when investments overseas are turned back into dollars.
In its most recent world investment report, Goldman Sachs takes a view that blends advice to practice restraint with the need to sell stocks. The firm concludes:
"There are good reasons for believing that equities might underperform in the short term, including the possibility that markets are likely to remain nervous about the economy. However, investors might consider that equities do well in January, that it pays to buy undervalued markets in January and that by being out of the market now, investors could miss a significant up side."

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Inflation: Just What America Needs

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
In 1933, with the country in a deep depression, J. P. Morgan the younger, then unquestionably the most important banker in the country, was called to testify at a Congressional hearing that in some ways resembled an inquisition.
Reading the transcript of Mr. Morgan's testimony nearly six decades later provides proof that, if nothing else, this economic downturn is not going to be a rerun of that Depression. 
 The politicians then, as now, were concerned about the way bankers decided who should be able to borrow money. One answer from Mr. Morgan stands out. "Do you make any loans on real estate?" asked Senator Duncan U. Fletcher, a Florida Democrat. "We never have," replied the banker. "You do not make any?" inquired the amazed Senator. "No," said Mr. Morgan.
In those days, bankers believed that real estate was too illiquid, and its value too subject to possible declines, to be suitable collateral for loans from a top-flight bank. By the 1980's, such attitudes were incomprehensible to bankers. But, first in Texas and then in Boston and New York, bankers have learned just how soft a real estate appraisal can be. Now San Francisco's Wells Fargo is getting the message.
The fact that Wells Fargo had some bad news to disclose was not exactly a surprise. Weakness in the California economy has been well publicized, and California bank stocks have been slipping since Labor Day. So the first Wall Street reaction was a sigh of relief that the bad news was out, and a wave of bargain hunting. Wells Fargo stock went up $3.25 a share.
Having bought the stock, the clever traders sat down to actually look at the numbers, and on Friday the share price plunged $5.50, to $55, the lowest close since January. It did not help that Standard & Poor's, warning that "the impact of the recession on California is worse than previously forecast," cut the state's bond rating.
Wells Fargo's problems illustrate why the recession has lingered. The basic problem is not just that companies and workers are earning less. It is that assets are worth less than they were supposed to be. The solution, it would appear, is to get assets to be worth more. Unfortunately, neither a stimulative monetary policy, which has been tried for a year, nor a stimulative fiscal policy, which Washington seems to be about to try, directly addresses that problem. What is needed is a little well-placed inflation.
Stock traders are still willing to bet that something will work -- and soon -- to get the economy growing and end the wave of layoffs. Share prices recovered last week following the report that November retail sales were not so bad, and as word spread that the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index had stabilized. Perhaps Christmas will be a decent one after all, as millions of consumers decide that things aren't so bad that they can't buy gifts. Now if they would just start bidding up real estate prices.

COMPANIES
 
Wells Fargo Battens Down the Hatches for a Lingering Slump 

When times are tough, it is not return on capital that's important, its return of capital. That's the problem Wells Fargo & Company, the big California bank, is facing. Last week it set aside $700 million for loan losses from its large portfolio of real estate loans (they make up 28.1 percent of its outstanding loans, the largest percentage of any major bank). Carl Reichardt, the bank's chief executive, said in a statement that "in this environment it is only prudent to make a significant addition to our loan loss reserves." California's economy (its bonds were downgraded last week) is the reason for the losses. "It is a year behind New England," said Jeff Thredgold, chief economist at Keycorp Inc., a banking company in Albany. Though shallower than New England's slump, California's is likely to last longer -- especially in real estate. "Seven of the 10 largest development projects in the nation are in Los Angeles," Mr. Thredgold said.

 
Orion's Hits Aren't Enough
 
The Orion Pictures Corporation has had some winners this year -- "Dances With Wolves" and "Silence of the Lambs" -- but neither generated enough revenue to keep the company from filing for bankruptcy protection last week under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy code. The studio, which is controlled by the billionaire John Kluge, missed an interest payment of $17.4 million last summer on its subordinated notes and debentures and was unable to pay $50 million of principal due Aug. 31. Talks with creditors about restructuring about $700 million in debt fizzled. Orion has postponed the release of several films that had already been shot. "We have taken this step," said William Bernstein, Orion's president, "because our discussions with the bondholders have broken down." Orion will try once more to restructure itself.


Trying to Be More Like Pan Am
 
Capitalists, by nature, are an optimistic bunch. That's why one restaurant opens after another just closed at the same location. It's also why the bidding was so fierce last week for the Latin American routes of defunct Pan American World Airways. Though Pan Am, encumbered by debt, couldn't make a go of it, American, United and Delta Airlines were sure they could. What was supposed to be a one-day auction conducted by Judge Cornelius Blackshear of the United States Bankruptcy Court, lasted two days. In the end, United Airlines won Pan Am's routes. It will pay $160 million in cash and hire 1,000 former Pan Am employees. (American bid $155 million.) There is a gleam in United's eye because it is now America's only global carrier with routes to Asia, the Pacific, Latin America and Europe, a route structure not unlike Pan Am's -- in the old days.
 
 
Talk about optimists. Carl C. Icahn, who owns ailing Trans World Airlines, and Robert R. Ferguson 3d, president of bankrupt Continental Airlines, began talks last week about merging their carriers. Mr. Icahn initiated the talks, Continental said.

 
Back to Pizza Again
 
Last week, Thomas Monaghan re-emerged after what was called a "religious reawakening" to take control of the daily operations of Domino's Pizza Inc. Two years ago, Mr. Monaghan left Domino's to devote himself to religious studies and charity work. He put the company on the block -- he owns 99 percent of its stock -- for $1.2 billion, but found no buyers. While he was away, profits slipped. Domino's had sales of $2.65 billion at its franchise stores and company revenues of $1.2 billion, but it delivered profits of only $5.4 million last year. Those slim profits -- and Mr. Monaghan's faith -- brought him back to pizza making. Though he has vowed to improve the quality of Domino's pizza, at least twice a week, Mr. Monaghan eats nothing but bread and water. "God will help him find his way," said Mike Jenkins, Domino's public relations director.
 

TRW Tries to Shape Up
 
They called it a "service-sector recession." The Middle West, with its manufacturing and export-oriented industries, was about all that kept growth positive. But last week, TRW Inc., the big Cleveland-based industrial company that makes, among other things, air bags, truck axles, brakes and communications satellites, said it was restructuring. TRW will sell businesses worth $400 million to $500 million; cut capital spending by more than $100 million next year (about 16 percent) and lay off 2,500 employees. The company will take a $250 million after-tax charge in the current quarter. "It's grabbing the bull by the horns," said Howard A. Rubel, an analyst at C. J. Lawrence. TRW's stock gained $2.875 on the annoucement to reach $40, and closed the week at $38.25.


Xerox and the American Dream
 
The Xerox Corporation is America in microcosm. It created a new industry from scratch -- plain-paper copying -- got rich and, well, got a little lazy. Xerox lost market share to Japan. Xerox -- like America -- fought back. It grew leaner, improved its quality and buffed up its image. It even won back market share from Japan. But last week Xerox acknowledged it has been hurt by the recession and must trim down. So the company will cut its payroll by 2,500 and reduce its costs by $150 million next year and $200 million in 1993. It will take a $175 million pretax charge against earnings. "It's a first step in the right direction," said Curt Rohrman who follows Xerox for First Boston.
 
 
 
ECONOMY

 
Tax Credit With a Pedigree
 
The Administration has seized upon an economic idea with an interesting pedigree. Last week, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, told the Senate Finance Committee that to get the economy rolling, the Administration might favor a tax credit for businesses that invest in plants and machinery. "The history of investment tax credits is that they are somewhat effective and maybe for that reason we ought to do it at this time," Mr. Brady told the Senate Finance Committee. Such a credit existed until 1986, when the tax code was revised. But lately, the chief proponent of the credit is not a conservative Republican at all. New York Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, a Democrat, has been touting the investment tax credit in speeches since May.

 
Sad Showing at Retail
 
For the nation's retailers, the holidays are usually the best season. If only that were the case now. Cautious consumers are wandering the malls, but they are hardly spending. Retail sales rose just three-tenths of 1 percent in November, the Commerce Department said last week. Those gains come after a downward revision of retail spending for October. "The November retail sales figures confirm that the holiday shopping season was slow getting out of the blocks," said John M. Albertine, a Washington economics consultant. Not only that, but inventories grew last month by 1.5 percent, the Government said. That's not supposed to happen around the holidays.
 

Bright News on Inflation
 
A slow economy keeps prices stable. Only business naifs and the auto companies would dare raise prices when the goods don't move. So it was no surprise when the Labor Department reported last week that prices at the producer level rose a slim two-tenths of 1 percent in November.


Spikes in Consumer Prices
 
At first the figures looked worse than they were. The Consumer Price Index rose by 0.4 percent in November, the Labor Department said. But on closer examination, there were just three major culprits. The first was the whitefly infestation in California. Those tiny insects, munching on produce that's still in the fields, have damaged crops and driven food prices higher. Then there were rises in the prices of prescription drugs and of gasoline. Consumer prices have risen just 2.9 percent so far this year.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL

 
Detroit, Meet Tokyo
 
Next month, when President Bush visits Japan, he will have some unusual traveling companions: Lee Iacocca, chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, and Harold Poling, chairman of the Ford Motor Company. Robert Stempel, chairman of the General Motors Corporation, is still mulling over the invitation. Mr. Bush and the automakers will go to Japan, Mr. Iacocca said, to make Tokyo realize America is serious about trade. The United States and Japan have been talking seriously about trade since 1978. Last month, Japan's trade surplus nearly tripled, to $6.56 billion from $2.24 billion a year earlier. More than half of that surplus -- $3.59 billion -- resulted from trade with the United States.


Britain's Escape Plan
 
Unifying Europe has not been easy. It took 2,000 years of warfare to determine today's borders (more or less) and 30 years of talks to decide on how to dissolve them. Last week at Maastricht, the Netherlands, the Community's 12 heads of state outlined the next step in the unification process -- the creation of a single currency and a central bank to manage it by 1999. But the British have been extremely reluctant about giving up control of their currency. So Prime Minister John Major of Britain accepted the plan -- but with a caveat. Britain reserves the right to opt out of the single-currency scheme any time before January 1997. To appease British sensibilities, the communique that was issued omitted what was referred to as the F-word -- federalism. Britain, you see, is a nation, not simply one of a dozen states.
 
 
Copying the Community
 
While Western Europe was unifying, the Soviet Union was becoming unglued. Last week Russia's President, Boris N. Yeltsin, and the leaders of Ukraine and Byelorussia, replaced the union with a new commonwealth. The republics will use the ruble as their common currency, defend themselves jointly and harmonize their economies. Five Asian republics joined the commonwealth last week. That leaves the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, "a king without a country," said Vladimir Kvint, a lecturer at Babson College. In the new commonwealth, "the relationships between the republics will be like the relationship between countries in the European Community," he said. That is a remarkable transformation. All that's needed now is a workable economic plan. Some things remain the same.

Restoring Loyalty to the Workplace

BYLINE: By MICHAEL MASTANDUNO and RAYMOND VERNON; Michael Mastanduno is assistant professor of government at Dartmouth College. Raymond Vernon is emeritus professor of international affairs at Harvard University.

 BODY:
As United Nations inspectors scour Iraq in a desperate hunt for contraband and nuclear materials, Washington is abuzz with schemes to insure that future Saddam Husseins don't turn up on the world stage. The coming debate over the lapsed Export Administration Act will enable members of Congress and the Administration to offer their plans, and high on the list will be proposals for the United States to impose even tighter export controls.
Yet as we approach the first anniversary of the gulf war, one lesson that every policy maker should have absorbed is this: Export controls are no panacea. Such controls, especially unilateral ones, have proved inadequate against the determined efforts of governments to develop a capacity for the mass destruction of their neighbors. 
 During the 1980's, Saddam Hussein managed to obtain -- from many suppliers -- sensitive technologies and more than $40 billion in military equipment. During the Cold War, despite history's most prolonged and ambitious system of export controls, the Soviet Union designed and produced tens of thousands of nuclear warheads and created a formidable conventional capability.
If export controls are to be effective, they must be focused narrowly and have multilateral support. American controls against the Soviet Union, for instance, were most successful when coordinated with other countries and targeted at technologies with clear military significance. Compare this with Washington's first moves after the gulf war. To control the spread of biological and chemical warfare capabilities, it tried to ban anything -- even trucks and typewriters -- that seemed destined for use at such facilities. And, according to current plans, export licenses are required for anything an exporter "knows" will contribute to development of lethal weapons. The House's version of the legislation contains some control proposals that are similarly comprehensive -- and equally unlikely to win multilateral support.
Measures like these play well in Peoria. The Government gives the appearance of leaving no stone unturned as it tries to bottle up gruesome technologies and punish companies that trade with the enemy. And the Administration knows that nobody wants to be accused of promoting the spread of chemical and biological weapons -- least of all an American exporter who might one day need the support of regulators.
Yet such measures actually do great mischief. They undermine the chances of establishing a system of deterrents that may really count. And, with enterprises and technology moving easily across borders, they invite American producers to move their facilities elsewhere. They also weaken the United States economy and saddle exporters with the stigma of being unreliable.
For 40 years, the United States has led the world in the zealous use of export restrictions, with efforts that, at times, have seemed ludicrous. These efforts have included attempts in the 50's to control the export of machetes and mosquito netting to suppress agrarian rebels in Latin America, and efforts in the 70's and 80's to restrain the export of personal computers and oilfield equipment in the Soviet Union. At times, other nations have been greedy and irresponsible in resisting sensible American appeals for their cooperation. Just as often, their resistance has been based on the conviction that the American proposals were futile, misguided and counterproductive.
Export controls should be used more as a scalpel than as a wrecking ball. They cannot produce results when sources of supply are numerous and the products are common commodities.
The key ingredient for maintaining peace in the modern world is nurturing and strengthening a consensus worth maintaining. Such a consensus was an indispensable element in NATO's success in containing the Soviet Union and in the success of Desert Storm in containing Iraq. Any policy that weakens the chances of building and maintaining such a consensus -- such as the indiscriminate use of export restrictions -- must be curbed.

HEADLINE: The Executive Computer;
Hands Off the Keys, Noses Into Books

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
Not long ago, as part of a national survey, an advertising agency asked computer industry engineers and managers about their favorite leisure activities.
Among those who responded, reading (18 percent) was by far the most popular choice, with golf (5 percent) a distant second. Other pastimes included: being with the family, travel, music, computer hacking and fishing (all 4 percent); woodworking and gardening (3 percent each), and sex (1 percent). 
 So, without drawing any conclusions from the data, here are some suggestions for reading material and gifts.
"Cyberspace: First Steps" ($24.95, Massachusetts Institute of Technology Press, Boston) is an anthology of essays and musings on one of the most exciting, exotic and least understood frontiers of computing.
The term cyberspace, popularized in William Gibson's science fiction novel "Neuromancer," refers to the ephemeral otherworld that exists in the global electronic web of computer and communications networks. Although it has its genesis in science fiction, it is a mistake to conclude that it has no significance in the business world.
If information is indeed the oil of the 21st century, computers are the refineries and networks are the the pipelines. Many companies, especially banks and other financial institutions, exist in the electronic twilight of computer systems. What is the essence of a bank, after all, if not a flow of data?
Michael Benedikt, a professor of architecture at the University of Texas and editor of the book, refers to cyberspace as an "elusive and future thing," and it remains elusive at the conclusion of the book. Yet the descriptions offered in the book are compelling. The writers work at companies and institutions including the International Business Machines Corporation, Electronic Data Systems, Texas Instruments, Bull Worldwide Information Systems, Stanford and M.I.T.
"The advent of cyberspace will have profound effects on so-called post-industrial culture," Mr. Benedikt writes, "and the material and economic rewards for those who first and most properly conceive and implement cyberspace systems will be enormous."
Nearer on the horizon, and also promising rewards for business, are expert systems. "The Rise of the Expert Company" ($19.95, Times Books, New York City), by the artificial intelligence experts Edward Feigenbaum, Pamela McCorduck and H. Penny Nii, is subtitled "How Visionary Companies Are Using Artificial Intelligence to Achieve Higher Productivity and Profits."
Artificial intelligence is one of those unfortunate terms that promises more than it delivers. Computers are not yet "smart," but they can serve as repositories for the collected wisdom and experience of senior executives.
Others, then, can extract the intelligence and apply it to problems that range from product development and administration to manufacturing. A new breed of computer experts called knowledge engineers are creating a form of artificial intelligence known as expert systems.
Expert systems allow companies, not just individual executives, to work smarter, and among the companies profiled are Du Pont, Fujitsu, Navistar, Northrop, Canon, I.B.M. and American Express.
This book first appeared in 1988. But the vision it describes is perhaps more important today. Tom Peters, a management consultant and author, writes in the forward, "Any senior manager in any business of almost any size who isn't at least learning about artificial intelligence, and sticking a tentative toe or two into A.I.'s waters, is simply out of step, dangerously so."
And then there is a book for executives and dreamers who are ready to go beyond toe-dipping and take the plunge.
"High-Tech Ventures, The Guide for Entrepreneurial Success" ($29.95, Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Reading, Mass.), is by C. Gordon Bell, with John E. McNamara. Mr. Bell, a scientist and engineer, worked 23 years as a research and development director at the Digital Equipment Corporation before becoming a principal in more than 20 high-tech start-up companies. Some succeeded, some failed. The lessons from each are laid down here.
Anyone thinking of starting a high-tech company, or investing in one, will find this book valuable. Mr. Bell dissects start-ups including Ovation, Analytica, Cirrus Logic, Thinking Machines, Apollo and Sun, in each case offering behind-the-scenes insights into the heady world of high tech.
"High-Tech Ventures" includes an explanation of the Bell-Mason Diagnostic and Prescriptive Method, developed with Heidi Mason, a specialist in high-tech marketing and sales. The Bell-Mason method is a rule-based tool that systematically assesses the health and wisdom of a start-up at several well-defined stages.
There are charts and graphs aplenty, a natural given Mr. Bell's background as an engineer. These reveal the relative strengths and weaknesses of four key elements of any high-tech start-up -- technology/product, people, marketing/sales and finance/ control -- at each of four stages of growth.
Each area, in turn, is measured in three dimensions. For example, the people quadrant is broken down to the chief executive, the directors and the team. A company can be strong in one area and weak in another, but rarely does a fledgling company succeed with the wrong leadership.
"High-Tech Ventures" concludes with a look ahead, and its predictions are provocative: the United States will continue to lead the world in inventiveness; the Japanese will dominate every market through their strength in innovation.
One area where American innovation may save the day is in computer programming, especially in an emerging field known as object-oriented programming.
"Object Oriented Technology, a Manager's Guide" ($19.50, Addison-Wesley, paperback), by David A. Taylor, is one of the first accessible guides to the most important trend in software development.
Mr. Taylor, a management consultant, has a knack for explaining highly technical concepts in a way that executives, managers and other nonprogrammers can grasp. The simple diagrams and illustrations make it virtually painless.
Object-oriented programming (OOP) holds the promise of making it easier for executives to get the data they need, and it promises to allow businesses to construct software applications in a fraction of the time now needed. It does so by using software "packets" that contain data and the instructions necessary to act on the data.
Only a few personal computer software companies, notably Borland International Inc., are pursuing OOP relentlessly.
Philippe Kahn, the founder and chief executive of Borland, recently made a videotape explaining "The World of Objects" through the medium of Mr. Kahn's jazz band -- an analogy of individual components that know their own data and also how to act on it.

HEADLINE: Technology;
Trout From a Tank - Maybe Fertilizer Too

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

DATELINE: ITHACA, N.Y.

 BODY:
In a converted dairy barn, a stable and a boat storage shed outside this Finger Lakes city, a number of fledging entrepreneurs and Cornell University professors are trying to make aquaculture history.
For nearly a year, they have been raising trout indoors. More important, they have been doing so with a method so economical of space and energy that three tanks, a water recycling system and a starter crop of 2,500 fingerlings would cost under $10,000. The system would require little more than a gallon of water per fish and comfortably fit in 750 square feet -- a typical one-bedroom apartment. And if it works, it could make fish farming as viable in abandoned inner-city warehouses as it is in Idaho's open fields. 
 "We've figured out how to make water recycling cost-effective almost anywhere," said R. G. Douglas Ley, manager of the Northern Fresh Fish Cooperative, a consortium of eight would-be fish farmers who are serving as the new system's guinea pigs.
The "we" that Mr. Ley referred to comprises professors at Cornell University's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, who were looking for an industry that could enhance their Tompkins County economy. Already a billion-dollar business in the South and Midwest, trout farms seemed tantalizing, except for their intensive use of water.
Most trout farms are near flowing streams, which send millions of gallons of fresh water gushing through the man-made ponds on a one-time ride. Tompkins County, despite its lakes and its frequent snowfall, does not have water to spare.
But it does have an agricultural college with professors itching to solve seemingly insurmountable problems. Indeed, for five years, several of them have been tinkering with ways to raise trout in recycled water.
The system they came up with uses standard circular grain bins with polyvinyl chloride liners, each 12 feet in diameter and about 3 feet high and with a capacity of about 2,500 fish. A feeder above the tank sprinkles fish food every 15 minutes.
The fish feed constantly -- and therein lies a recycling problem: what to do with the inevitable aftermath of that feeding. Fish excreta are very high in ammonia, which can be toxic to the fish. In flowing streams, naturally occurring bacteria convert the ammonia to harmless nitrites and nitrates. In a closed system, the ammonia can build up so fast that even the hungriest of bacteria cannot keep up. Since bacteria multiply in direct proportion to the surface area available for them to grow on, the trick was to create a large surface area in a tiny space.
Cornell's answer, on which it has a patent pending, is its rotating biological contactor, a lattice-work wheel consisting of hundreds of honeycombed plastic cylinders that provide the bacteria with huge amounts of surface on which to grow. Water is continuously pumped from the fish tanks into a separate vat that holds the wheel, which is constantly rotating to keep the water aerated and to give the bacteria a chance to work.
"Without the contactor, none of us would have thought of going into a water-intensive business like fish farming," said Laurene M. Gilbert, a landscape-architect-cum-fish-farmer and the cooperative's chairwoman.
Theoretically, once the water is ammonia-free and nitrate-rich, it is safe to pump back into the fish tank. But in practice, it often contains solid waste residue, which although chemically harmless could lodge in a fish's gills and interfere with its breathing.
"No question, filtration of solids is the weakest link," said Richard J. Marisa, a member of the cooperative.
The novice fish farmers and the Cornell professors together are experimenting with processes to get rid of solids. One prototype system, which pumped water through a fine nylon mesh, required too much energy for the pump and too many unclogging sessions for the screen. The group is now trying a gravity-based system that has the water flowing through a black plastic material that looks like corrugated cardboard; the plastic retards the flow, thus letting the solids settle out by weight.
Mr. Marisa is about to try a third system, patterned loosely after the closed-cycle cloth-towel mechanisms common in public washrooms. A plastic cylinder hooked to the edge of the tank will rotate fine-meshed plastic screening through the water, where it will pick up solids. As the plastic emerges from the tank, a jet spray of water will blow the solids off the plastic into a nearby settling tank. The cleaned plastic can then rotate back into the tank. An added bonus: the nitrogen-rich solids can be collected for use as fertilizer.
Any one of these systems could clean and aerate water from tanks much larger than 12 feet across. But the professors are advising the cooperative to expand by adding many small tanks, to prevent diseases, contaminants or accidents from jeopardizing an entire crop of fish.
"One large tank may seem more efficient, but how much risk do you want to associate with one unit breaking down?" asked Michael B. Timmons, a Cornell associate professor and one of the researchers.
Another source of risk, of course, occurs on the business side of the venture: To wit, will restaurants and supermarkets buy the fish?
There is a lot to be said for farmed fish. Unlike meat, fish is not government graded. That means that fish caught in polluted waters can pass through the distribution process undetected. It also means that old fish, skillfully filleted, can be sold as fresh.
But traditional fish farms have their own problems. There is the danger of having something toxic get into the local water table. Moreover, the operators cannot guarantee absolute freshness to someone in a distant town any more than a purveyor of fish caught in the wild could.
The inexpensive Cornell system would make it practical for fish farmers to establish tank setups so that any customer could get fresh fish on command. The cooperative members are banking that local customers will pay extra for the privilege.
There is some indication that they will. Robert Dennerlein, purchasing director for the Statler Hotel -- the on-campus hotel operated by Cornell's School of Hotel Administration -- has negotiated to buy fish from the cooperative at $3.25 a pound, untrimmed, even though he could get fully trimmed trout from Idaho for well under $3. "Fish that has to be flown in can't be as fresh," he said.
John Parmalee, who owns the Old Port Harbor Restaurant in Ithaca, agrees and plans to sign up as a customer as soon as the fish are available. "The fact that this is locally produced and could be supplied 365 days a year would be worth $1 more a pound to me," he said.
And there is vast potential in economies of scale. This coming year, the experimental setups will probably produce just 30,000 one-pound fish, so when marketing, water testing, fish fingerlings, feed and other costs are factored in, these trout will cost about $3 a pound to bring to market. But Professor Timmons believes that once the cooperative is producing 250,000 pounds of fish a year -- doable, Mr. Ley expects, within two years -- it could get the cost as low as 90 cents, making it easily cost-competitive with outdoor-grown fish.
The indoor system may help the cooperative reach that volume. Trout grow fastest in oxygen-rich water that is kept at about 65 degrees Fahrenheit -- a good 15 degrees warmer than most mountain streams -- and constant light retards the fish's sexual maturation and shifts its energy from reproduction to growth.
That knowledge is useless for outdoor fish farms. Warm water does not hold gas well, and the inexpensive bubble machines that can easily oxygenate a 12-foot tank of water would be inadequate for aerating a deep outdoor pond. As for light, no one can legislate the setting sun.
Indoor fish farmers, however, can easily regulate electric light and heaters. And by doing so, they can compress a trout's hatched-egg-to-dinner-table cycle to 12 months. In the wild, it takes two years.

HEADLINE: All About/Debt Collection;
Persuading People to Pay Their Bills During Hard Times

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
Debt collectors, the enforcers of the credit world, have long been plagued by a reputation as unscrupulous thugs who work in fly-by-night operations and delight in pouncing on people when times are tough.
But the debt-collection industry says it has been misunderstood and unappreciated. Today's debt collector, industry executives assert, is a well-educated and courteous professional who is regulated by strict laws and uses the latest technology to perform a vital service in a credit-driven economy. 
 To be sure, the business has undergone fundamental changes in the last two decades that have improved its reputation, regulators say. Nationwide companies with hundreds of closely supervised collectors and computerized operations have arisen from an industry once comprised exclusively of small firms serving businesses in their neighborhoods.
The American Collectors Association, a 3,600-member trade group, has worked to pass laws regulating the business. It has also sponsored a campaign to educate collection agencies about proper conduct and the public about its rights -- all in the interests of making people more agreeable if collectors come calling.
These changes came just in time for agencies to benefit from the debt-clogged 1980's. The industry has expanded rapidly in recent years; collectors handled $66.5 billion in debts in 1990, up from $14.5 billion in 1980, the association said.
But even Linda Russell, the association's president, acknowledges that no matter how much the industry reforms, debt collectors will be unpopular and unwelcome to much of the public. That is particularly true in the current recession, when more and more people have fallen behind in their payments and debts are more difficult to collect.
"I think the debt-collecting industry is a lot more understood now than it used to be," said Mrs. Russell, chief executive of CollectionCenter Inc., a privately owned agency, which is based in Rawlins, Wyo., and employs 31 collectors in five offices.
"But I guarantee you that there are many, many people who will never understand what it is," she said. "People feel very distressed when someone reminds them of their debts. And I don't think there is a thing that we can do to change that."

 
 
Modern-Day Collectors
Politeness and Some Psychology
 The 6,000 or so collection agencies in the United States typically work on commission, earning about 25 percent to 35 percent of what they collect for businesses that give them "listings" of people behind in their payments. Collectors working for agencies are usually paid a salary and a commission, which varies from company to company.
Industry executives say their clients are divided into four major groups: health care, including hospitals and doctors' offices; retail businesses, including department stores and credit-card companies; utilities, and commercial accounts, for businesses owing money to businesses.
After receiving a listing, the collection agency writes to the debtor, explaining that it has been given the account and requesting the money owed. This step can be complicated, though, for it is often difficult to find the debtor's address.
In the past, collectors often visited debtors' homes. But to cut costs, most now use the phone. Some agencies have developed sophisticated strategies for talking to debtors; some have employed industrial psychologists to devise scripts. But in general, most agencies tell their collectors simply to be polite and sympathetic.
"You don't collect bills by screaming at someone," said James R. Bohmann, a senior vice president at Payco American, the largest agency in the country. "You collect bills by understanding people."
The debtor usually does not pay immediately, prompting the collector to try to fashion a payment plan. Eventually, many agencies will threaten to sue a debtor.
"There are two things collectors look for: ability and willingness," said George Goodyear 3d, the president of Goodyear & Associates, a privately owned agency in Charlotte, N.C., that employs 34 collectors.
"If the consumer-debtor has the ability to pay, then almost everyone would say that he or she should pay," he said. "If he or she does not have the ability, but does have the willingness, we will work out a solution."
Debt collectors are regulated by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act, which is administered by the Federal Trade Commission. Under the 1977 act, collectors cannot threaten debtors, lie to them or call them at inappropriate times, like the middle of the night. Conversations and correspondence with debtors are confidential. And debtors can tell collectors to stop contacting them.
Industry executives and regulators say the debt act has helped reduce the instances of some of the industry's more unsavory practices -- like threatening phone calls or harassment of debtors' employers or families.
David Medine, an acting associate director at the F.T.C., said the agency does not keep track of how many complaints it receives. But he said there had been a "significant downward trend" in the last decade.
"Some of the worst abuses that were widespread have been reduced," he said. "Across the board, I think that there probably has been improvement, though it certainly has not been uniform."

 
 
Computer Helpers
They Keep Records And Dial the Phone
 Twenty years ago, the office of a typical collection agency was awash in note cards recording each time a debtor was contacted or payment was made. That changed in the early 1980's, when agencies began using computers to maintain files on debtors, call them and search for their addresses.
These days, the offices of companies like Payco American seem like huge data processing centers. At Payco's headquarters in Brookfield, Wis., nearly 100 collectors work on computers linked to a mainframe system the company spent $20 million designing.
Payco, a publicly traded company with $106.3 million in revenues last year, had profits of $5.42 million, a 34 percent increase from the previous year. Payco uses the system to monitor accounts at its more than 40 offices and to set work standards for its 2,500 employees. When the company receives a list of debtors, the computer automatically sends the accounts to collectors who specialize in areas like transportation, health care, student loans or credit cards.
At Nationwide Credit, an Atlanta-based company with 11 offices and 900 collectors, automatic dialers call debtors until the phone is answered; at that point, the call is sent to a collector and the debtor's file appears on the collector's computer screen. The system frees collectors from wasting time with busy signals or calls to people who are not home.
To find addresses, agencies also use computers to access "skip tracers" -- national data bases with information gleaned from telephone directories, subscription houses and voter registration files.

 
 
A Time of Debt
During a Recession, It's Harder to Collect
 Though collection agencies profit from financial misfortune, most do not like recessions. The number of people owing money may increase -- drastically in some areas of the country; but at the same time, debtors' ability to make payments declines, forcing collectors to work much harder.
So while collection agencies may not be suffering as much as other businesses in the current recession, most are not reaping any windfalls. The number of people paying off debts to agencies fell from 21 percent of listings in 1988 to 18.3 percent last year, the American Collectors Association said.
"We're getting more of it, but it's less collectible," said Larry Sheridan, a vice president at Nationwide Credit, which is a subsidiary of First Financial Management Corporation, a publicly traded company. "People think that because there is more business coming to the agency, we should be doing better. But we're not doing any better than before."
Mr. Sheridan said Nationwide's revenues had declined in 1990 and 1991, but did not give the figures, which First Financial does not disclose separately.
Mrs. Russell said small agencies were running into trouble because struggling businesses have withheld listings rather than pay collectors' fees. But she said in the long run, the small agencies would not be harmed or swallowed up by the bigger ones.
"There is a market niche for each of us," she said. "The Paycos will get the large national firms. But there are a lot small businesses that are much more responsive to dealing with someone who is also a local business person. What we return to small businesses might make the difference in whether they survive or not."
Mrs. Russell -- who cheerfully acknowledges that she does not fit the stereotype of the debt collector as a "rough-talking large male who browbeats people" -- said she hoped the industry's ability to weather the recession would encourage more people to become collectors.
"Contrary to popular image, it's a fun job, because you deal with people," she said. "And the real fun is that you can tell when you are a success."

 
 
HOSPITALS MAKE GREAT CUSTOMERS

In the days when most doctors made house calls, hospitals and medical offices rarely hired debt collectors. But as health care costs have soared in recent years, more and more people are having trouble paying for medical care, forcing more billing departments to hire collection agencies.
The health care market for debt collectors has grown so much in the last decade that many agencies now consider it their No. 1 source of clients.
James R. Bohmann, a senior vice president at Payco American Inc., called the increase "dramatic." He said many hospitals, facing strong competition, found that in the past they were losing money because too many bills went unpaid.
"What is occurring is that there used to be inefficiencies in the cash-flow process in the health care system," Mr. Bohmann said. "They have to be better managers of their cash flow. They can't afford to make interest-free loans."
George Arges, a senior policy analyst at the American Hospital Association, said many hospitals have become bogged down in compiling and mailing bills as they try to meet the specific requirements of the more than 5,000 insurance companies in the United States.
"You're spending more resources trying to send out billing information," he said. "It's very time-consuming. Hospitals don't have the staff to follow up and collect the money as well."
The growth of this market has led agencies to train collectors who specialize in deciphering complicated medical bills so they can better serve clients and have more of a chance of persuading debtors to pay.

BYLINE: By John Durniak; John Durniak is a freelance writer, editor and consultant on photography.

 BODY:
Today is the 200th anniversary of the ratification of the Bill of Rights, the first 10 amendments to the Constitution. And when Bob Adelman, a freelance photographer in New York, found that the Government was not planning to celebrate this anniversary formally, he decided to do it himself with a book, which appeared last month: "Visions of Liberty, the Bill of Rights for All Americans" (Arcade/Little, Brown, $24.95).
Caught by the recession in publishing and advertising, many freelance photographers are poorer this year, and some have been forced out of business. But ideas, like the one for this book, have made this a good year for Mr. Adelman. Making his living by shooting photographs mostly for publications, Mr. Adelman expends the rest of his professional efforts on packaging original books. 
 Book-packaging involves finding a saleable idea; researching, obtaining, and editing pictures; hiring a writer and designer, and contracting with a publisher to distribute the finished work. Sometimes, a book starts with a grant, but usually the packager risks his own money.
Mr. Adelman said many lawyers who bought "Visions of Liberty" considered it to be a picture book because it includes about 100 photographs. But photographers consider it to be word book because there are more pages of writing by Ira Glasser, the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union, than there are pages of photographs.
Throughout his life, Mr. Adelman said, he has been driven by a strong sense of justice inspired by his parents and the Harvard Law School. He left Harvard before receiving a degree to pursue photography and to study for a master's degree in philosophy at Columbia.
In the 1960's, Mr. Adelman assigned himself -- out of conscience, he said -- to shoot pictures of the civil-rights movement when most professional photographers were saying there was no money in it. Then, they were right, but Mr. Adelman gained national recognition as a photojournalist for his efforts. In addition, he now gets a steady stream of revenue from this unpaid work, which is now being sold to publishers by the Magnum picture agency.
Mr. Adelman created images that have become famous: his picture of the water-hosing of black demonstrators in Birmingham, Ala., in 1963, a photograph that appears in the "Visions of Liberty," and a strong candid portrait of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., which has been used in publications hundreds of times.
In pursuing special projects, Mr. Adelman has kept his overhead to a minimum.
"I live modestly without a flashy car, no designer clothes and no posh apartment," he said. "When I need a studio, I rent it, and the client pays for it. When I need special equipment, I don't buy, but rent."
Mr. Adelman's apartment in Manhattan looks like a giant photo gadget bag with a built-in library. It is a hive of film, lighting equipment, layouts for proposed books, rechargers for batteries, contact sheets, lenses and a professional darkroom.
To save time and money, he has analyzed the basic lighting situations for most of his shooting and has chosen six films that work best in those environments: three color films (Kodachrome, Ektar and Ektapress) and three black-and-white emulsions (Ilford FP-4, Kodak Tri-X and T-Max 3200.)
Mr. Adelman also teaches a course with John Loengard, a former picture editor of Life magazine, at the International Center of Photography at Fifth Avenue and 94th Street in Manhattan.
He tells his students to seek out a broad market if they wish to be successful freelancers. "A professional today can no longer think of his market as New York or the United States only," Mr. Adelman said. "Now we have to consider the world market. Rome, London and Munich are important and contribute much to the photographic economy."
Although Magnum sells his civil-rights work, Mr. Adelman handles most domestic and overseas sales of his photographs himself, eliminating the middleman. "When two photo agencies, one here and one abroad, sell a picture story," he said, "the photographer gets the least amount of money out of the deal."
This year, Mr. Adelman put together a British edition of "Carver Country," his 1990 book about the short-story writer Raymond Carver. He has also begun work on a book about Grace Kelly, using more than three decades of photographs by Howell Conant, the star's personal photographer.
Mr. Adelman's advice to photographers is simple: expand your imaginations and not your studios.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Donald V. Fites, chairman of Caterpillar Inc. ("Trapped in the Impoverished Middle Class," Nov. 17), says: "There is a narrowing of the gap between the average American's income and that of the Mexicans. As a human being, I think that what is going on is positive. I don't think it is realistic for 250 million Americans to control so much of the world's G.N.P." 
 As a reflection of the plantation-owner mentality of the new class of the very wealthy in this country -- whose fortunes have soared while everyone else's have plummeted -- this statement by a prominent member would be hard to beat. It says everything that arrogance, scorn and condescension could suggest concerning his own employees, his fellow townspeople of Peoria and of working American families generally.
One wonders how willing Mr. Fites would be to tread water until his salary and bonuses are matched by his counterparts in the third world. According to a recent study, the salaries, bonuses and other emoluments earned by top executives in this country are not just outrageous but grotesque. Assuming Mr. Fites's compensation fits the pattern, here is a golden opportunity to set an example.

 BODY:
Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator, announced his candidacy for the Republican Presidential nomination last week, charging that the vision of a New World Order dancing in President Bush's head will make the United States keep playing the role of global sugarplum daddy.
"America First" is Mr. Buchanan's not-exactly-new theme, and Mr. Bush was quick to attack those very words and the isolationism they stood for before Pearl Harbor. But Mr. Buchanan argues that alliances created to face down the Soviet Union, under which the United States footed the defense bills for much of the world, need to be re-examined now that a uniting Europe and a Japan-led Asia are powerful competitors. Acknowledging that he is a long shot, he hopes that New Hampshire, bludgeoned by the recession, will prove a good field for his domestic theme: that Mr. Bush, not liberals, is to blame for huge deficits and for the switch from "read my lips" to mere lip service to the idea of lower taxes.

The Tax Recipes Vary, But Share a Sour Taste

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
For years, policymakers have held strong opinions about the best mix of taxes. Some criticized New York State for getting over half its revenue from income taxes, compared with about a third for other states. Too volatile a source, critics said. Legislators will be sorry when a recession hits.
Others blamed Connecticut for refusing to impose any income tax and relying so heavily on sales and business taxes. Its 8 percent sales tax and 12 percent corporate income tax rates were the highest in the nation. Too consumption-oriented, they said, and unfair to companies. And that could leave the state especially vulnerable in an economic downturn. 
 New Jersey, on the other hand, was criticized for the hefty property taxes its local governments imposed, leaving the state able to get away with relatively low sales and income taxes. Too much of a penalty to homeowners, some said. While all levels of New Jersey government got about 42 percent of their revenues from property taxes, the average in other states was about 30 percent.
New York City was considered at fault, meanwhile, for being more reliant on taxes generally, and for being particularly wedded to personal income taxes and sales and consumption taxes, all of which are deemed to be more sensitive to the ups and downs of the economy.
The Financial Control Board, a state agency set up in the fiscal crisis of the mid-70's to monitor the city's fiscal health, noted recently that the city depends on local taxes for about 58 percent of its operating budget, compared with about 40 percent for the average local government. And while municipalities typically derive about 75 percent of their tax revenue from property taxes, which are considered relatively stable, New York gets about 44 percent of its tax revenue from that source. The board concluded that its predictable spending needs coupled with its particular mix of taxes "is a major cause of New York City's fiscal problems."
 
Wrestling With Deficits
 Everybody has a pet peeve when it comes to tax policy, but what is striking when one looks at the tax receipts for the three states and New York City is how different they are in composition, yet how similar their problems quickly became when the bottom fell out of the economy. Though they each took very different paths to get there, New Jersey, Connecticut, New York State and New York City all ended up with serious budget deficit problems that they are still wrestling with.
As Cynthia B. Green, a senior research associate at the Citizens Budget Commission, put it, "When times are bad, times are bad."
The earliest sign of trouble was the decline in corporate income taxes. It hit New York State first, but by the 1990 fiscal year all three states were suffering an absolute decline in their takings from that category. Steven D. Gold, director of the Center for the Study of the States at the State University of New York in Albany, does not find that surprising.
 
Slow Reflexes
 When an economy goes into a recession, he said, companies' costs continue to rise even though their revenues are not going up as quickly. It is hard for them to react as quickly to revenue shortfalls as individuals can.
"Corporate profits are the most volatile part of the economy," Mr. Gold said. "Corporate tax revenue has been very weak throughout the country."
By fiscal year 1991, it was clear that the effects of the economic downturn were working their way into other tax categories. The fiscal year begins July 1 for all these jurisdictions except New York State, whose fiscal year begins April 1. Both New York and Connecticut suffered declines in income tax receipts, with Connecticut also enduring a drop in sales tax revenue. Both states found themselves having to make do with lower total revenues that year, which is one reason they enacted a variety of tax changes to increase their future receipts.
Of course, tax revenues would look even worse for the three states and New York City if legislators had not reacted to the recession and the threatening deficits by raising various tax rates. New York City's Finance Department has calculated that if the city had not raised its income tax rates, revenues in that category would have been $355 million less in fiscal year 1991 and $683 million less in 1992, resulting in two years of actual decline. The same is true for property taxes: without the various increases in rates on different classes of properties, New York City's property tax receipts would have been $319 million less in 1991 and $670 million less in 1992.
The assumption that revenues would rise in fiscal 1992 in the three states and New York City reflects similar kinds of emergency measures. New Jersey raised its income tax rate substantially, while Connecticut, after much hand-wringing, decided to impose an income tax for the first time in its history.
Of course, forces within those two states' legislatures have been threatening to undo those tax measures, but if they do they will simply have to come up with funds from elsewhere. And they may have to anyway, given that they both appear to be facing growing budget deficits.
In a severe economic recession virtually all taxes are likely to be hard hit. At that point a state's ability to weather the storm has more to do with how quickly it responds by raising rates and cutting costs. And with deficits looming in all three states and the city, two state legislatures already in revolt over tax packages passed earlier and a third trying to cobble together a multi-year package for this and the following fiscal year, the jury is decidedly out on which jurisdiction is performing best.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Seen Again at Maastricht: Adam Smith's Invisible Hand

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY

DATELINE: MAASTRICHT, The Netherlands

 BODY:
As they struggled to put at least some of the pieces of what used to be the Soviet Union back together again last week, Boris N. Yeltsin and the other leaders of his new Commonwealth of Independent States would have done well to keep one eye on the leaders of the European Community.
Europe is steadily pulling itself together, but for the last 46 years it has been a lot easier to do that economically than politically. Last week's European summit meeting at Maastricht was no exception. The 12 leaders who gathered here agreed relatively quickly on a single currency to go with the single, barrier-free market they will have by the end of next year, but they could not advance as far as some had hoped down the road to political union. 
 Still, when the talks were over it was a lot easier to see what the European Community would look like by the end of the century than it was to see what would become of the Soviet Union. By the year 2000, it is now clear, the European market will be far bigger than that of the United States or Japan, with close to 350 million people and a single currency, at least among the countries on the Continent with the strongest economies; this new currency should be a powerful stimulus to trade, commerce and investment.
 
An Expanding Club
 The new Europe will stretch from the Atlantic to at least the Russian border, if Finland, Sweden, Austria and perhaps Norway have joined by then, as expected. Austria and Sweden have already applied and could be accepted as early as 1995. Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary also want in, but for them, as well as for Ukraine if it decides to try, more time will be needed to build market economies.
Economic necessity gave birth to the European Economic Community in 1957. Even Britain, which at first was frozen out of the fledgling Common Market by France and later became fastidious about whether the club was really good enough for it to join, has no serious questions any more about the economic benefits of membership. Prime Minister John Major does not really have any about the benefits of a single currency, but to satisfy the doubters at home who have gathered under the banner of his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, he had to get his 11 partners to agree that Britain could remain outside the monetary union agreement until its Parliament made the final decision on whether to join.
There is no real doubt that Britain will finally do so, according to politicians of all the major parties there. And that time will come by 1997 if a majority of the European countries qualify as economically ready then or, at the latest, by 1999, under the treaty.
Britain's consistent skepticism about rushing into things is based on an acute awareness that when countries agree to a common currency, they in effect surrender some of their most basic sovereign rights, pooling their sovereignty in monetary affairs. The threat to the pound sterling has been vigorously debated in Britain for months and months. The threat to the mark seems to have caught the German public unaware, according to German diplomats and journalists here who said that only last week did it dawn on Germans that the mark would soon be replaced by something else -- the European Currency Unit, or more felicitously, ecu, the same name taken by a royal French coinage in the 17th and 18th centuries.
But in Europe, E pluribus is definitely not yet unum -- far from it, as shown by Britain's insistence on staying out of a European-wide program of improvements in working hours, minimum wages and conditions of employment. The leaders of the 11 other community countries argued about this with Mr. Major most of Tuesday before finally throwing up their hands and exempting Britain altogether while they pledged to go ahead on their own. O.K., Mr. Major and his officials joked, if the others want to encourage the Japanese and the Americans to build all their plants in Britain, that's all right with us. The 11 others hope for a British change of heart later on.
 
'Harmonization'
 Continentals often do think in more Cartesian ways than Anglo-Saxons, and the European Community's Executive Commission in Brussels has been pushing for "harmonization" of everything from working hours to value-added taxes on a Continent where no two countries have exactly the same electric plugs, telephone connections or even languages, let alone cultures or historical traditions.
Words mean different things, as well. To Germans, "federal" has come to connote a comfortable decentralization with local control; the structure of Germany's federal republic lets the states decide their own educational and cultural policies. To Britain, whose central Parliament can do or undo systems of local government all over the sceptered isles on the whim of whatever majority is in power in London, talk of a "federal" Europe connotes only an unwanted loss of sovereignty to Brussels.
Differences far smaller than these led to the American Civil War only 78 years after the more perfect union described in the preamble to the United States Constitution. In the preamble to the political union treaty signed in the wee hours Wednesday, Mr. Major made the others take out a reference to a federal vocation for the European Community and settle instead for an "ever closer union among the peoples of Europe," who all now also enjoy citizenship in what the treaty calls the European Union.
It is easy to wonder what exactly that is. Political union remains a vague goal, even though the leaders agreed last week to implement joint foreign policy decisions by majority vote in four areas -- arms control, disarmament, nuclear proliferation and economic aspects of security. They also decided to awaken the long-slumbering nine-nation Western European Union and direct it to strengthen Europe's contribution to NATO and build the framework for an independent European defense.
But first the Europeans have to show that they have joint policies, something they haven't demonstrated in relation to the Yugoslav civil war at their eastern doorstep, or even for what has been the Soviet Union. But for all the vagueness and talk about national sovereignty, the outlines of a new Europe are slowly becoming clear. It is something that will give not only Russians but Americans a lot to think about in the years to come.

HEADLINE: RISING HUMAN NEED OUTSTRIPS GIVING

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOUSTON, Dec. 13

 BODY:
In a converted warehouse that serves as an emergency shelter for homeless families here, the recession's pain is felt equally by those who give and those who receive.
As the economic downturn makes it more difficult to find willing contributors, the Star of Hope, the local charity that runs the shelter, struggles with staff cuts and budget deficits even as a growing number of people seek help after losing their jobs and then their homes. 
 Around the country this holiday season, charitable organizations large and small are finding themselves in the same bind: needs are increasing much faster than contributions.
 
Frayed Safety Net
 At a time when social welfare benefits have been trimmed and eligibility for them has been restricted, charity is the final safety net for those already poor and incapacitated, as well as for the economy's freshest victims, and now that net is becoming frayed and tenuous.
With traditional year-end charity drives in full swing, Americans are still contributing despite the hard times. The United Way of America, by far the largest program collecting money for charitable groups, is expecting to gather 2 to 3 percent more than it did last year, but that would be the smallest increase in more than 30 years.
"When Americans see their neighbors in trouble, they give more," said Col. Leon Ferraez, director of national communications for the Salvation Army, "so our income is up nationwide by as much as 16 percent, and that's not unusual in a recession. The downside is that demand for services has increased by more than 25 percent."
And increasingly the demand is coming from people who have never sought charity before.
"I used to see the homeless people on TV and think that could never happen to us because we've got jobs, but it happened to us," said Mamie Brown, a nursing assistant who is now living in the Star of Hope shelter, along with her husband, Walter, a construction worker, and their six children. "We lost our jobs and now we are here."
The Star of Hope operates five shelters in Houston that can house a total of 600 people. Kathy Tabor, director of development, said the group is now running a 15 percent deficit because people started filling the shelters to capacity in July, in the hot weather, and the number seeking help has not tapered off.
"It should have dropped off in the fall, but it didn't," Mrs. Tabor said. "Most of the time people say they've been evicted because they can't pay the rent."
Nine staff positions have already been cut so that programs can continue, and only a holiday surge in giving will stave off further staff reductions.
"We're seeing larger donations in the last two weeks than they have been all year, but we need about three Decembers," said Mrs. Tabor.
 
Similar Predicaments
 Interviews with officials of charitable groups around the country this week showed that hundreds of other charities are in similar predicaments.
In San Francisco, Project Open Hand distributes meals and groceries to 1,200 people with AIDS every evening.
"We have gone from beef three times a week to chicken three times a week, and instead of chicken, we sometimes serve a vegetarian dish, or macaroni and cheese," said Steve Burns, executive director.
Although he vowed there would be no interruption in service despite decreased donations, Mr. Burns said: "We're keeping our fingers crossed. November was not as good as we thought it might be, and we're holding our breath at this point."
 
Cut in New Orleans
 In New Orleans, the Salvation Army has cut its paid staff to 20 from 37 four years ago. Associated Catholic Charities has fewer bus tokens to give the unemployed searching for work, and last year one family counseling program was absorbed into another, producing ever longer waiting lists.
And at Hope House, a community agency at the edge of the St. Thomas Housing Project in New Orleans, Don Everard, the director said: "We're always in a shortfall because the needs are just out of control, but in the past three or four months, it's been more so than ever. At the point we are now, the issues keep coming back to, 'Can we keep it going, can we meet the salaries to keep it going?' "
In Chicago, Ronald Hitchcock, a 43-year-old unemployed laborer, rang a bell at a Salvation Army kettle on State Street outside a symbol of the recession, the empty storefront of a recently closed men's clothier.
Hundreds of office workers and shoppers passed by the busy downtown intersection, but few bothered to put money in Mr. Hitchcock's kettle. Most people did not look his way. And some even walked between Mr. Hitchcock and his bell stand.
"I guess some people don't give because they don't have it, and others because they don't want to," Mr. Hitchcock said.
 
'Every Little Bit Helps'
 Greg Jacobsen, a 22-year-old insurance company worker was one of the few who did, donating $1.50.
"I was standing at the corner waiting for the light and I heard the bell ring," he said, "so I dug in my pocket and gave what I have. I feel good. I mean, if I was in need of money and gifts for Christmas, I'd hope somebody would give to me. I donated just because people need help now and we're in an economic recession and every little bit helps."
Donations to the Salvation Army in Chicago are down 19 percent, and Robert Cotner, director of development, said several programs would probably be altered or scaled down even though Illinois officials warned that there would be increased requests for help next year because of cuts in assistance programs for low-income residents.
For some leaders of charitable organizations, the squeeze this holiday season is the culmination of events dating back a decade, and perhaps a turning point as well.
The Rev. Thomas J. Harvey, president of Catholic Charities USA, said, "During the Reagan Administration the responsibility for many social welfare programs was shifted from the Federal level to the states, and now with some 40 states facing budget deficits, the government role is really contracting."
Needs, however, did not shrink during the 1980's. While poverty figures fluctuated in the economic boom, the proportion of Americans living in poverty rose from 13 percent in 1980 to 13.5 percent in 1990, with a sharp upswing in the last year of that period. The Census Bureau reported that there were 33.6 million people living in poverty in 1990, an increase of 2.1 million from the previous year, when the poverty rate was 12.8 percent. The Government's poverty threshold is increased each year to reflect inflation and stood at $13,359 for a family of four in 1990.
Analysts at the Census Bureau expressed surprise at the sharp increase, since the recession did not begin until about halfway through 1990. "Our plate," Father Harvey said, "was full when this recession started."
An annual survey of the 163 Roman Catholic dioceses that support agencies affiliated with Catholic Charities found that in 1980 only 23 percent of the agencies' clients needed emergency services like food and shelter to make it through another day. By 1990 such services were sought by 62 percent of the agencies' eight million clients.
 
Competition Is Increasing
 Faced with increased competition from nonprofit organizations in fields like the environment, animal rights or the arts, social service agencies often found it more difficult to raise money.
"A majority of people in this country are far enough away from any direct experience of poverty that they do not identify with it even as a national problem," said Father Harvey. But he believes this changes with a recession.
"This kind of downturn," he said, "reminds people that there are capricious forces at work. It explodes the myths that the poor are poor out of choice because people see their neighbors going unemployed due to circumstances beyond their control."
An indication of that was reflected last year in The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund as it collected more than $4.4 million, a record amount. Nancy Nielsen, spokeswoman for The Times, said, "This year even though contributions are down a little right now, we hope to break another record because people do make an extra effort during hard times."
Other charities are also seeing this effect. Harvey Vieth, director of Camillus House, a social service agency in Miami, told of the effect of the increased visibility of poverty that he had seen: "At Thanksgiving we were expecting 100 turkeys and we received 400, and we received so many canned goods we could hardly store them. I think so many people are close to it now; they see friends without jobs. It's hitting closer to home.
"Over the last six weeks the face of the homeless has begun to change. More Hispanics and whites are now in the food lines; more people are closer to the work force; some are just out; some of them have jobs and/or homes, but no money for food."
These are what social service workers are calling "the new poor."
"They are people who are poor for the first time," said Ann Maguire, the executive director of the Boston's emergency shelter program. "They always had a job. They paid the rent every month. Now, they need to ask for help. There are a lot of these folks."
In Miami, Dr. Bernard Baumel, director of the Neurological Centers of South Florida, is one giver who has been moved by the recession's effect. "The economy has affected my income but I have not cut back my giving," Dr. Baumel said. "The need is so apparent. Homelessness is much more prevalent; you see it. It's been a bad year for everybody but the needy still need more. The appeals have been so much more emotional. I think it's my conscience. I look at it as an obligation, another bill to pay."

HEADLINE: New Teamster Chief's Motto: Honest Work for Honest Pay

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
In the truck yards and teamster union halls of America, the ghosts of Jimmy Hoffa, Jackie Presser and other godfathers of a more brazen era linger in the tales of gangland muscle and mysterious disappearances, of payoffs, sweetheart contracts, looted pension funds and rigged elections.
But there is a new legend in the making these days for the rank-and-file of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. Its unlikely hero is a 55-year-old former United Parcel Service driver who, after 23 years leading a local in Queens, has just been elected to a five-year term as president of the 1.5-million member international union. 
 His name is Ronald Carey, and they say he is an honest man.
 
'A Frank Capra Figure'
 "The fact that he's won is astounding," said Stanley Aronowitz, a labor expert and a professor at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York. "He's a real outsider. This is 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington.' He's a Frank Capra figure. He's the unexpected guy coming in from left field yelling about corruption and the need for militant unionism and getting elected."
Mr. Carey, a former marine and a father of five who buys his suits off the rack, eats tuna sandwiches for lunch, drives a 1989 car and has lived in the same Kew Gardens house for 35 years, is a man who shuns extravagance, stays at budget hotels, carries his own suitcases, accounts for every penny of his expenses and for years has gone daily to the yards to talk to members.
"What's important is getting the confidence and trust of the members," Mr. Carey said in an interview on Friday after the final tally confirming his election. "They haven't trusted their union for years. It's their union. They want it to work for them. It hasn't. We're only caretakers. It's turned into a dictatorship over these years. Now we've got to get democracy back."
Associates say Mr. Carey works 12 hours a day, six days a week, almost never takes a vacation and truly earns his $45,000-a-year salary as president of Teamsters Local 804 in Long Island City. Many of his 6,800 members earn more than he does and revere him for what they call an unswerving integrity typified by his first announcement as international president-elect -- that he would cut his salary from $225,000 to $175,000 and then "get the bums out."
To a nation long accustomed to a teamster clan run by cigar-chomping thugs who sold labor peace to the trucking industry and drew whopping salaries while defying investigators and keeping potential rivals under the thumb with threats and loaded bylaws, the election of an all-but-unknown dissident seems almost as improbable as the end of the cold war, the Soviet Union and apartheid.
To hundreds of thousands of teamsters, who in the union's 88 years had never cast secret ballots to choose their international leaders, the election was a triumph that could spell vast reforms. Mr. Carey has vowed to sweep out the old guard, cut bloated salaries and expense accounts, rewrite sellout labor contracts and return the union to its members.
And to Mr. Carey, the success of an uphill two-year campaign to wrest away the presidency of the nation's second-largest union has abruptly propelled him onto the national stage, with the potential to be a major player in decisions on economic policy and, by his union's endorsement, a factor in the 1992 Presidential race.
 
A Determined Revolution
 Within the union, the hard-won victory will pose great challenges for Mr. Carey. He faces struggles to root out nepotism and greed in many of the union's 615 locals and in an entrenched bureaucracy at the union headquarters in Washington. And he faces the huge task of rebuilding a union whose power has waned.
In mail balloting supervised by Federal courts under a settlement in an anti-racketeering suit brought by the Justice Department, Mr. Carey had 188,883 votes in a race against two old- line leaders, R. V. Durham, who had 129,538 votes, and Walter Shea, who had 71,227. Mr. Carey will succeed William J. McCarthy, who did not run for re-election, in about a month.
The story of Mr. Carey's rise to the helm of one of America's most corrupt unions on a reform ticket is the story of a revolution within the international, according to labor experts and others familiar with the fight.
"It's a triumph of union democracies over organized crime," said Herman Benson, the secretary-treasurer of the Association for Union Democracy, a civil liberties group. "Carey deserves credit for having the courage to run at the beginning. This is a union where people get murdered."
 
Product of a Union Family
 Ronald Robert Carey was born in Manhattan on March 22, 1936, the second of five sons of Joseph and Loretta Carey. His father, a frugal man who instilled the work ethic in his children and believed strongly in the union movement, was a United Parcel Service driver for 40 years. The couple, who died earlier this year, raised the family in Astoria and Long Island City.
Ron Carey, a strong, athletic youth who loved to swim, graduated from Long Island City High School in 1953 and enlisted in the Marines. In 1956 he joined United Parcel as a driver, a job he kept for 12 years, delivering packages mostly in Woodside and Maspeth, Queens. He and his father pooled their money and for $18,000 bought and began sharing a modest two-story home in Kew Gardens where he still lives.
In 1958, Mr. Carey, already an ardent unionist, became a shop steward for Local 804. Soon, he began taking labor-relations courses. He ran unsuccessfully for local trustee in 1962 and for recording secretary in 1965, but was not discouraged. In 1967, he ran a well-organized campaign for the local presidency and won. He took office in 1968 and gave up driving.
Mr. Carey proved to be a solid, intense negotiator at the bargaining table. He led the local in strikes ranging from 9 to 13 weeks in 1968, 1971 and 1974, and by 1977 had more than doubled his workers' hourly wages and had won major improvements in working conditions and benefits, including the right to retire after 25 years.
Throughout those years, associates say, Mr. Carey, who was eventually re-elected eight times to three-year terms by landslide margins, kept Local 804's affairs relatively independent of the international union, whose spreading stain of corruption was making it harder to organize new shops.
 
Distance Ffrom the International
 The teamsters represent more than truckers. On its rolls are factory workers, health-care workers, police officers, firefighters and other municipal workers, flight attendants, pilots and employees in other industries. About 10 percent of the members are U.P.S. delivery and warehouse workers.
While Mr. Carey tried to distance himself from the international, he was quick to support work stoppages by other New York locals, associates recalled. "Any time I had a strike or any of the locals had a strike, the U.P.S. drivers under his instructions refused to cross the picket lines," said William Nuchow, secretary-treasurer of Teamsters Local 840 in Manhattan.
Visiting yards and garages to talk to his members daily, working nights and weekends to address their grievances, cracking down on corruption in the local, even taking a cut in his own salary when the local treasury was low on funds, Mr. Carey, by all accounts, became increasingly popular with his members and acquired a reputation as an honest, straightforward leader.
He made it a policy of his local that no relatives of any officer could be hired for a union job, and he insisted that his fellow officers also visit the yards daily to talk to members.
"That's what this job is about," he said. "It's out there with the members. You'll never service the members sitting in an office. I see a union as a mechanism to help people."
He held members to his own standards, as well, said Kenneth Spillane, a vice president of Local 804. "He's been known to chew out workers trying to make frivolous complaints or trying to get out of work. He believes in a hard day's work for an honest dollar."
 
In Touch with Workers
 In the yard, Mr. Carey had a subdued way about him that the men liked. He had been a driver and spoke their language, understood their problems and took them seriously, members said, and he did not act like a big shot. "He's for the people; he's for us," said Robert LeDux, a driver for four years.
But at international headquarters where leaders enjoyed multiple salaries and perquisites from limousines and jets to lavish entertainment and travel accounts, associates said Mr. Carey was viewed first as eccentric, then as something of a troublemaker.
The disaffection was mutual. Mr. Carey tossed the international's fliers into the waste basket. But while he shunned the international, it was virtually impossible for his local to break away. Under the union constitution, only 7 of the local's 5,000 votes were needed to block independence.
After 1979, the local's longstanding right to negotiate its own contracts with U.P.S. was "stolen from us," Mr. Carey said, when the international forced it to accept nationally negotiated bargaining results. While Mr. Carey headed one of the largest U.P.S. locals and had a name as a top negotiator, he was not appointed to the teamsters national bargaining team.
And when the resulting settlements with U.P.S. in 1982, 1985 and 1987 won wage increases as small as 2 percent, Mr. Carey campaigned against ratification of what he called "sweetheart" deals. He lost those fights, mainly because union bylaws allowed rejection of a proposed contract only when two-thirds of the members voted against it, an all-but-impossible goal to meet.
Mr. Carey filed a lawsuit against the provision in 1987, and the union's executive board, apparently fearing an adverse ruling, changed it to permit a majority to reject a proposed contract. Mr. Carey also began to speak out more forcefully against the international leaders' lavish incomes.
Now perceived as a growing threat, Mr. Carey found his name expunged from international newsletters and house organs, and at a national convention the microphone was cut off once as he appealed for a cut in dues. Occasionally, his friends said, there were threatening calls in the night.
His increasing prominence and his willingness to take on the union bosses in Washington -- portrayed in news accounts as a David-versus-Goliath battle -- upset the international leaders. But his rebellion generally coincided with new setbacks that were preoccupying the union.
Since the 1950's, Federal investigators said, the international union had been mired in corruption. Three of the union's last five presidents -- James R. Hoffa, Dave Beck and Roy L. Williams -- went to jail on charges of bribery and tampering with pension funds. A fourth president, Jackie Presser, was indicted for embezzlement but died in 1988 without being tried.
 
New Rules From Government
 In 1988 the Government filed an anti-racketeering suit against the union and a panel was named to oversee its affairs. In 1989, to settle the suit, the union allowed the Government to expel 138 leaders and agreed to have leaders chosen by members' secret ballots rather than delegates in convention.
This radically changed the prospects for Mr. Carey and his insurgency. Backed by Teamsters for a Democratic Union, a small but growing movement to fight corrupt leaders from within, and encouraged by a real chance of election, Mr. Carey began a two-year campaign for the presidency.
Mr. Carey did not join the group, but its grass-roots network was vital to him, providing heavy support among truckers in the Midwest.
His campaign was financed mostly by small contributions of members, who put up $200,000. He criss-crossed the country in a beat-up station wagon, staying at members' homes and low-budget hotels, meeting teamsters in yards and halls, and talking about corruption, bad contracts and a membership that had declined from 2.2 million in 1979 to 1.5 million.
After the results were in, Professor Aronowitz, of the City University Graduate Center, attributed the victory to Mr. Carey's determined democratic stance and clean image and to a low turnout that enhanced the value of his enthusiastic supporters.
Mr. Carey celebrated yesterday with his wife, Barbara, a sales clerk at Macy's in Queens, and their five children: Ronald Jr., 35, Daniel, 33, Sandra Perrone, 32, Barbara Marchese, 30, and Pamela Casabara, 28.
"It's a new union for the members and their families," Mr. Carey said. "It's goodbye to all the things of the past. The Mafia. The mob. All those who don't want to work hard. Goodbye to those who put themselves first, who are not concerned with the members or their families."

HEADLINE: Bush Tells Mexico He Wants a Free-Trade Pact Soon

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
President Bush today told President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico that he wanted a free-trade agreement as soon as possible, even as support is waning in Congress for considering such a pact in an election year.
In talks at the President's Camp David retreat in Maryland, Mr. Bush also told Mr. Salinas that Mexican concessions would be needed to obtain a politically acceptable deal, according to an Administration official who insisted on anonymity. 
 The official said that the two presidents and their advisers had disagreed in particular on the extent to which Mexico would open its oil-services industry -- which many Mexicans consider to be part of the national patrimony -- to American competition.
 
'A Lot of Work' Ahead
 Mr. Bush called for a draft agreement, with differences between the two countries noted in brackets, to be ready by the end of next month, the official said. The President also noted that reaching a pact "would take a lot of work and include some give on the part of the Mexicans," the official added.
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said in a statement after the meeting, "Acknowledging the substantial progress that has been made to date, the two presidents reaffirmed their strong commitment to the achievement of a North American Free Trade Agreement."
The Administration official who requested anonymity said that while Mr. Bush had told Mr. Salinas and advisers that he "wants a good agreement as soon as possible," no specific month was set for concluding the talks and submitting a deal to Congress. Mr. Bush and Mr. Salinas also spoke for an hour without any advisers present and did not reveal the nature of their discussions, the official added.
 
A Divided Administration
 Administration officials had told industry lobbyists that a deal could be submitted to Congress next year and approved before the election. But controversy last spring over whether a complicated agreement could be negotiated that fast, and a lingering recession that has magnified concerns about possible job losses from a trade pact, have left the Administration divided on when and how to proceed.
The Commerce and State Departments have been more enthusiastic for prompt action in recent weeks than the Office of the United States Trade Representative.
Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said on Dec. 2 that he hoped to have a draft agreement ready for Congress by next March. But Carla A. Hills, the Trade Representative, has for the last eight months resisted providing any target dates for legislation. "We have no intention of substituting speed for substance," she said again at a White House news briefing on Friday.
When Administration officials were wooing industry lobbyists early last spring to join them in pushing for a deal, they spoke in terms of submitting a package to Congress in early 1992 for approval before the election. But the Administration retreated from this position in late spring when it was criticized for being too willing to rush an agreement.
If an agreement is not approved next year, it could become a political casualty of the recession. The agreement's fate in 1993 would depend on whether President Bush and members of Congress who support a deal are re-elected.
Democratic senators and representatives with strong free-trade beliefs joined Republicans last May to renew President Bush's legal authority to negotiate trade agreements and submit them for expedited consideration by Congress. The votes in both houses then were viewed as ballots on whether the United States should seek a free trade agreement with Mexico.
 
Warning From Democrats
 But in telephone interviews this week, some of the same Democrats were unenthusiastic about trying to pass an agreement next year. They warned that as long as the economy is weak and public opinion polls show wide concern about unemployment, a trade agreement that promises not only job gains but also highly visible job losses will be very hard to sell in Congress.
"It's not in the President's interest to bring this up," said Representative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat and strong free-trade supporter on the House Subcommittee on Trade. "He'll lose it on the floor of the House and Senate next year if he brings it up."
House and Senate leaders are more reserved while beginning to express similiar worries to Administration officials.
"I'll tell them what the problems are, and they'll face a tough political time in the Congress, but it's their decision," said Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who chairs the Senate Finance Committee.
Senator Max S. Baucus, the Montana Democrat who chairs the Senate Subcommittee on International Trade, said that "the mood of Congress has shifted somewhat" and made it tougher to pass any international trade pact.
Mr. Baucus, Mr. Bentsen and Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon led the successful "fast-track" renewal effort last May. Mr. Packwood, Republican, does not expect the Administration to submit the agreement to Congress next year because so many complicated issues remain to be negotiated, said a Republican Senate aide.
Support for the prompt passage of a free trade agreement has also been weakening in the House. The majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt, said that while he was still willing to vote for an agreement that protected the interests of American workers, he was increasingly skeptical that the Administration was able or willing to negotiate such a deal.
The Missouri Democrat's reluctant endorsement last May helped secure the renewal of the President's "fast-track" authority.
But Representative Don J. Pease, an Ohio Democrat who has opposed a free-trade agreement because of concerns that American workers cannot compete with low-wage Mexican workers, said that it was too soon to dismiss the possibility of Congress's approving an agreement.
"The situation is still pretty fluid," he said. "Members of Congress traditionally don't engage issues before they have to."
Opponents of a free-trade agreement seized last month on the election in Pennsylvania of Harris Wofford to the United States Senate on a campaign that included criticisms of a trade pact with Mexico as well as calls for change in the nation's health-care system. But Pennsylvania, with its long-struggling steel industry, has long ranked as among the most protectionist states in the nation, and few members of Congress see it as representative of national sentiments on trade.
"For 20 years, every senator, every representative they have had from that area has been very protectionist," said Representative Sam M. Gibbons, the Florida Democrat who chairs the House Subcommittee on Trade and was elected to the House in 1962.
The protectionist theme of conservative columnist Patrick J. Buchanan's campaign for the Republican Presidential nomination has made the prospects for a North American Free Trade Agreement even murkier. Under President Ronald Reagan, by contrast, the isolationist and protectionist currents in the Republican Party's conservative wing had been muted.
"If they become more nationalistic, there's not going to be many people in this country who are free traders other than a few intellectuals in New York, like the Council on Foreign Relations and a few others," Mr. Matsui said.

HEADLINE: With Little Meaning, Florida Offers First Democratic Contest

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAKE BUENA VISTA, Fla., Dec. 14

 BODY:
It was perhaps fitting that the first contest of the 1992 Presidential campaign is being staged in the shadow of Walt Disney's Magic Kingdom.
All the trappings of a legitimate political event were on display today at the Florida Democratic Party's convention: There were fiery speeches. There was a hall jammed with placard-waving delegates. There were balloons and bumper stickers. There were competing cocktail parties with the candidates. 
 But even the Democrats' leading cheerleader, Ronald H. Brown, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, showed up at the convention, on the eve of a straw poll of the delegates, to throw cold water on the whole affair.
"I don't like beauty contests, I don't like straw polls," he said. "There's been some experiences in the past that those who win straw polls don't win primaries."
 
'This Doesn't Mean Anything'
 Although party leaders dismissed the nonbinding poll as meaningless, four Democratic candidates sought today to win support. Not willing to forfeit an event that could carry symbolic significance, the candidates worked quietly but aggressively to court the more than 2,300 delegates who will vote on Sunday.
After a day of speeches where the candidates united in their bashing of President Bush for the sorry state of the economy, one delegate who was not fooled was Sam C. Loper 3d, a salesman from Seminole, Fla.
"In the end," Mr. Loper said, "this doesn't mean anything. Nine months from now, what happened here probably won't be what happened in the rest of the country."
The cynicism did not dampen the enthusiasm of Simon Ferro, the state Democratic chairman, who in a burst of overstatement proclaimed to the delegates: "The 1992 Presidential campaign starts here today, this weekend. We Florida Democrats are going to play a crucial and relevant role in choosing our party's nominee."
The frenetic campaigning of four candidates here -- Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and former Senator Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts -- belied their aides' efforts to play down the poll's symbolic significance. Mr. Clinton and Mr. Harkin were the most aggressive behind the scenes, with their campaigns sending letters and videotapes of the candidates' speeches to potential supporters.
 
Saving Barbs for Bush
 In speeches here today, each of the four contenders sought to convince state party officials that he should win the straw poll and that he would capture the nomination next year. The candidates took pains not to directly attack one another, saving their barbs for Mr. Bush, who they assailed as neglecting the nation's domestic needs.
Mr. Clinton, the first to speak, described himself as best positioned to defeat Mr. Bush. In a clear response to critics who say he is too moderate, he defended his Democratic credentials.
"I've heard all that rhetoric about who's a real Democrat," he said. "I've supported every Democratic nominee since I was old enough to vote. I remember two Democrats accused of not being liberal enough: John Kennedy and Jimmy Carter."
Accusing Mr. Bush of lacking a vision to deal with joblessness and education, Mr. Clinton said, "We do not need a president of either party who doesn't know what he wants to do for America."
Mr. Kerrey, vowing to "make George Bush a one-term President," called for "fundamental change" in how the Government is run. "We've been led on a course of economic decline," he said. "We have been led off course by a President who has invited a season of cynicism."
Mr. Harkin sounded his theme of a return to unabashed liberalism. "I'm going to make George Herbert Walker Bush apologize for what he has done to America," he said. "I want a president who feels at home in America. It's time for us to take our traditional Democratic values to the American people. And those traditional Democratic values can be summed up in two words: economic opportunity."
Mr. Tsongas derided Mr. Bush as a "foreign minister -- not a president." He said "George Bush has finally met an unemployed person in New Hampshire: His name is John Sununu." Saying that calls for a middle-class tax cut amounted to political rhetoric that would not truly help the middle class, he assailed them as "twinkie economics -- it tastes great but no nutritional value."
Mr. Tsongas also insisted that he was not in the race to lose. "Some have said losing is good for your character -- I have enough character."
 
Waiting for Cuomo
 Several delegates said after the speeches that no candidate emerged from the pack by virtue of his oratory. But even as they played down the importance of a horse race, many delegates seemed to agree that the contest for first place was between Mr. Harkin, who benefits because so many delegates are from organized labor, one of his bastions of support, and Mr. Clinton, who has the regional advantage of being from the South. Two candidates did not attend: Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California.
Several delegates said the relevance of the convention would be further called into question if Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York announced his candidacy. A handful of convention delegates were still holding out, wearing "Waiting for Mario" buttons on their lapels, and some Cuomo partisans were passing out business cards today promoting a write-in effort on Sunday.
Former Gov. Reubin Askew of Florida placed first in the straw poll in 1983, but fell short of a majority because of strong labor support for Walter F. Mondale, who ultimately won the nomination. Four years ago, the national party frowned upon the straw poll as needlessly exhausting the candidates' time and money and prevailed upon Florida Democrats not to hold the event.
But this year, state party officials, seeking to bolster Florida's profile in national politics, said that since the field was off to a relatively late start it was important for contenders to get an early opportunity to make a mark.
"It's not a sacrificial thing -- bite your tongue," insisted Mr. Ferro. The outcome, he said, will show Floridians who is best organized in advance of the state's primary on March 10 when 160 delegates, the seventh-largest delegation of any state, will be up for grabs.
Many party officials say the results of the poll will be further overshadowed by Sunday night's first national debate among Presidential candidates. But Warren T. Zeuch, a delegate and retired deputy sheriff, said the poll may not be for naught. "We may just be a straw ballot today," he said. "But it could be a strong indicator of how the country feels tomorrow."

HEADLINE: CHINA'S INDUSTRIES QUITTING THE HILLS

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GUIYANG, China

 BODY:
A postscript to the cold war is being written here: a missile factory has been converted to make refrigerators.
Just as important, the refrigerators are rolling off assembly lines not in the company's old location in the mountains of south-central China but in a new industrial zone here in the provincial capital. As the people here say, the tiger has come out of the mountains. 
 The tiger is China's so-called Third Line of industry, built mostly in the 1960's. Fearing attack by the United States or the Soviet Union, Mao Zedong ordered 2,000 companies representing a large share of China's industrial and military capacity removed from vulnerable coastal areas to remote hillside towns in the country's interior. Mao thought that the Communists could rely on that Third Line of industry even if an enemy attacked the coast.
It was an extraordinary scheme, the most daring and perhaps the most ill-considered industrial relocation plan that any country had ever attempted. From the mid-1960's to the mid-1970's, nearly half of China's budget went to Third Line construction, but the new factories tended to be inefficient because of poor infrastructure and supply lines.
 
Moving Back to Cities
 In this post-Mao, post-cold-war era, the Third Line companies are now moving back to the cities, and in many cases retooling to make consumer goods instead of weapons. Across the nation, enterprises that once produced tanks and missiles and other military products are now making 650 kinds of civilian goods. Here in Guiyang, the capital of Guizhou province, two new industrial zones are filling up with Third Line factories making everything from transistors to automobile headlights.
"Intellectuals are very happy with the move, after being in the mountains for two decades," said Wang Quan, director of the Guiyang office of the Zhenhua Electronics Industry Corporation, one such enterprise. "Life is better here, there is entertainment and culture, and there's better education for the kids."
Of the 700,000 industrial workers in Guizhou Province who work in Third Line enterprises, about a third have already moved to the cities or are in the process of doing so, according to Hu Lun, chief economist of the Guizhou Province Planning Commission.
 
Efficiency and Location
 "We plan to move all our workers to Guiyang," said Mr. Wang, of Zhenhua, which has 30,000 employees at 21 factories scattered across Guizhou. "But that will depend on economics and on how efficient the factories are here."
One of the factories that already has moved and started operations in Guiyang is the Jianxin Machine Factory, a unit of Zhenhua that makes stone cutters, drill presses and other industrial equipment. In the past it exported some goods to Eastern Europe and now the managers are hoping that the improved location will improve exports to the West.
"It's much more convenient here," said Feng Yisong, a senior engineer of the factory. "Transportation is much easier, and it's far simpler to make contacts and get a hold of people. So our efficiency is much better now."
The factory shop -- emblazoned with huge red characters across the wall declaring: "Socialism is Good. The Communist Party is Good" -- is spacious and is taking advantage of a tax break to install some brand-new equipment in addition to assembly lines brought in from its old location near the town of Duyun.
 
Creating a Society
 The director of the nearby New Cloud Equipment Factory, Long Hanmin, said that though there is a hefty cost to moving the plant and all of its employees to Guiyang, the move will soon pay for itself in improved efficiency and reduced transportation costs.
"We used to be a company town and had to create our own society," said Mr. Long. "We had to provide schools, restaurants, a movie theater and a hospital. In Guiyang, we don't have to do any of that."
Mr. Long's factory used to make electronic components for the army, but it shifted a half-dozen years ago to manufacturing similar civilian products, like transistors and capacitors. These days, the transition from military production to civilian production is well underway, not just in Guizhou but throughout China.
For Guizhou Province, one of the poorest in China, that switch -- coupled with the emergence from the mountains of the Third Line "tiger" -- also offers an important opportunity to lure foreign investment.

HEADLINE: The Kind of Ransoms We Paid for Hostages;
For Reform in Iran

 BODY:
To the Editor:
For the first time since the seizure of the United States Embassy in Teheran in November 1979, no American is being held as hostage in Iran or Lebanon. While there is every cause for joy and celebration to mark this event, it is nonetheless prudent to bear in mind, once the dust has settled from the mood of euphoria, that every person responsible for instigation of the policies that held the United States and its Western allies hostage to their every whim remains in high office within the so-called Islamic Republic of Iran. 
 All the underlying reasons for their resorting to hostage taking and international terrorism in the first instance, such as a strong sense of insecurity, have been exacerbated by widespread unpopularity, largely as a result of futile warmongering and the worst economic crisis in Iran's modern history, imposed by incompetence and mismanagement.
"Hostages and Haste" (editorial, Dec. 3) draws attention to some of Iran's other sinister activities, which have always been overshadowed by the plight of the hostages, and I strongly agree that the restoration of normal relations by the West should be made contingent on genuine internal political reforms in Iran.
I am deeply concerned that in the aftermath of Iran's apparent exoneration from the Pan Am 103 tragedy, that the release of nearly all Western hostages should not give the Islamic authorities carte blanche to deal as they see fit with the suffering people of Iran. I should like to remind the international community that no sooner had Terry Anderson reached the Syrian Foreign Ministry in Damascus than Iranian authorities announced the execution of several "antirevolutionaries and monarchists" out of 300 who were arrested on the day Joseph Cicippio was freed.
I am hopeful that the release of all hostages marks the end of Western governmental cynicism to the plight of the Iranian people, and I believe that the international community, in particular the United States, no longer has any reason to be reticent about voicing uncompromising support for political freedoms and human rights in Iran.

HEADLINE: SOVIET DISARRAY;
A Texas Maverick Is Bullish on the Russian Bear

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
President Bush named Robert S. Strauss as Ambassador to Moscow figuring his old friend was just the man to sell capitalism to the Communists and the Soviet Union to American capitalists.
But capitalism has fallen on hard times at home, Communists are an endangered species, the Soviet Union is vanishing and the crusty Texas millionaire with a reputation for being able to sell anything to anyone is finding this sale the toughest of his life. 
 During a weeklong visit to Washington, where he does as much of his real work as in Moscow, Mr. Strauss sounded like a latter-day Horace Greeley urging young Americans to go East, occasionally like a diplomat analyzing Soviet affairs, and mostly like the political strategist that he has been for decades.
"We've got a natural political problem here," he said, growling down the phone line from his spartan State Department office to Robert W. Galvin, the Motorola chairman, who is helping him rally business to the cause of investing in the Soviet Union. "People are going to say, 'Why the hell are we creating jobs over there when we should be creating jobs here?' "
 
A Familiar Argument
 Mr. Strauss nodded as Mr. Galvin made the argument that Mr. Strauss often makes: investing abroad creates jobs at home and a prosperous, democratic Soviet Union will make the world safer. "You put the case just like that and tell them I'm behind you and I've talked to Jim Baker about it," Mr. Strauss said.
This is just the sort of thing Mr. Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d had in mind when they hired Mr. Strauss in August to serve as Mr. Bush's conduit to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and to promote American investment in the Soviet Union.
Mr. Strauss talks of his friendships with Mr. Gorbachev, Boris N. Yeltsin, the K.G.B. chief, and other luminaries with his usual flair and abandon, and with the homespun humor and Texas epithets that make him a brass band in the chamber-music world of diplomats and Sovietologists.
No one who knows the 73-year-old lawyer doubts that he has established a rapport with the former Communists, just as the Democratic back-room strategist made friends in both parties over the years.
 
An Old Pitchman
 Mr. Strauss is an accomplished pitchman, putting enough humor and skepticism into his tone (reminding everyone, for example, that he has no intention of voting for Mr. Bush next year) to make it seem that if it is snake oil he is selling, it is still worth buying.
"If I was 40 years old and I had $100,000 and I wanted to run it into $10 million, I'd go to the Soviet Union and I would find a place and invest it there, because it is going to be a booming economy one of these days," he said, adding with a laugh: "If I was worth $10 million, I would take that $10 million and I'd invest $100,000 of it in the Soviet Union, and no more."
It is not easy to get businessmen to invest in a country that looks like it might explode into civil war at any second -- especially when Americans are increasingly concerned about their own problems and skeptical about helping a far-off country that used to be the enemy.
This week, on one of the trips home that Mr. Strauss said he intends to make every two months or so, he met with dozens of businessmen, persuaded seven investment banking houses to send representatives to the Soviet Union, testified before Congress and delivered two speeches.
 
Frustrated Enthusiasm
 He tried to sound enthusiastic, but at times was clearly frustrated.
"I spend an awful lot of time feeling like I'm not accomplishing anything or it's a waste of time or I wish I was home," Mr. Strauss said in an interview on Friday. "Then about every three or four days, something will come up and I'll have a feeling that, well, the President was right, I did something today that my background and my experiences made me well-suited for."
Mr. Strauss's ability to make friends may have been far less important than Mr. Bush had anticipated before the aborted Kremlin coup in August stood Soviet politics on its head. Mr. Strauss arrived in Moscow on the day the coup began collapsing.
"Everyone thinks highly of Strauss, but he was overtaken by events," an Administration official said. "He went with a mandate to develop a personal relationship with Gorbachev. He was going to be the symbol of the Western economic model for Gorbachev." The official said that "the ground rules changed" with the decline of the Soviet center and that Mr. Strauss's relationship with Mr. Gorbachev would now have no impact on events there.
 
Political Instincts
 But John Lewis Gaddis, a historian of Soviet-American diplomacy, said that Mr. Strauss has strong political instincts and an access to Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker denied many ambassadors.
"My sense is that Strauss is pushing an agenda at the moment that is a little different from what the White House is trying to do," Mr. Gaddis said. "Strauss is running around raising the alarm that we ought to be doing something, although it's not entirely clear what. The Administration seems to be holding back waiting for the dust to settle."
Mr. Strauss's approach to the Soviet Union as a larger version of his native Texas may seem simplistic. He is not the sort of ambassador to provide historical sweep, as George F. Kennan did in 1947 by articulating the policy of "containment" to stop Soviet expansion. He will never master the Russian language. And he has had to learn from scratch facts of Soviet life that are old news to a Kremlinologist.
 
Knowing One's Audience
 But Mr. Strauss countered that Sovietologists are not his audience -- the President and American businessmen are.
"I didn't go over there to learn the culture of the Soviet Union," he said. "I went over there to get my hands on their problems. Everyone knows I'm not a Sovietologist. I am familiar with dealing with political problems and political power and from time to time have had the experience of trying to influence the direction that power flows."
While Mr. Bush and Mr. Baker avoid analyzing the Soviet power balance, Mr. Strauss does not mind at all. Here is his assessment of Mr. Gorbachev, Mr. Yeltsin and President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine:
"Obviously President Yeltsin's standing in the polls is much higher than Gorbachev. He's a far more popular person, but as he and Chairman Kravchuk, for example, get together, each of them begin to find they're not quite as popular as they were before they got together, because Mr. Kravchuk ran on a campaign that did not indicate he was going to be in bed with President Yeltsin. And President Yeltsin, who in taking care of his business denounced Chairman Kravchuk with regularity, is in bed with him. And we might as well be in American politics."
 
Politics as Poker
 Mr. Strauss is frank about the risks of investing in the Soviet Union. "What we invest may go up in smoke," he said, and then added: "Certainly you can make an argument that they're heading for anarchy, that despair and hunger and homelessness will take over and out of these ashes will come another demagogue, another Stalin. That is a real possiblity and our money will have been lost."
Mr. Strauss says repeatedly that he would be cautious with American aid. "I'm a poker player, Mr. Chairman, a pretty good one," he told the House Armed Services Committee last week. "And they say I talk loose and play tight and I think I would probably talk loose about that aid and would play tight. I'd want to be damned sure we got our money's worth out of it."
But he is fervent in making the case for American investment in the Soviet Union.
"The next big ethnic fight we're going to have to deal with is, I think, that the Germans and the Japanese are going to meet somewhere in the Urals and we're going to see the damndest fight you ever saw, because they're each coming from different directions and we're going to be on the sidelines," he said.
"In my lifetime," he said, "we have won a major war and won this peace, and we now have won a second war, and we're at risk, great risk, of not winning the peace."

HEADLINE: A Holiday Season With Little Cheer

BYLINE: By MARIA NEWMAN

 BODY:
Christmas hangs in the air over New York City, like the aroma of chestnuts roasting in the pretzel vendors' carts. It sounds like Christmas, with the voices of Dean Martin, Vickie Carr and the Chipmunks wafting from different store windows and spilling onto the sidewalks.
In some parts of the city it even looks like Christmas, with the explosion of white lights on the Rockefeller Center angels, the 55-foot balsam fir at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx and the clever displays in the windows of Barney's that really have very little to do with Christmas. (There was, for example, Margaret Thatcher sporting black leather and chains and a belt buckle that said Tory Toy. A few windows down, a two-headed Norman Mailer stood beside two erupting volcanoes that said Ego and Erudition.) 
 Though there is nothing like Christmas in New York, this year the holiday cheer was as fragile as a glass ornament. Not only has the weather been mild, but the economy has been as bad as anyone remembers in recent times, and it shows.
At Macy's, where giant wreaths fill the air with the scent of pine, executives are worried about revenues and perennial rumors of the company's impending demise. The Pan Am building looming over a festooned midtown is a grim reminder of a recently shuttered airline that left 7,500 people unemployed. With the city's unemployment rate at 10.2 percent, the highest for a November since 1977, it's little wonder that holiday shoppers seem to be wary of sinking further into debt.
Ahmed Aliyu, a taxicab driver, has his own barometer for measuring the state of the economy.
"In other years around this time, you wouldn't be picking up anyone without shopping bags," Mr. Aliyu said. "On Wednesday, I don't remember picking up even one person who had a shopping bag."
 
Maybe It's the Weather
 New Yorkers are trying to get into the spirit of the season, but there is an undercurrent of worry, or at least a sense that this year things are not as merry as in Christmases past. And in some parts of the city, there are few signs of the holiday at all.
On Columbus Avenue near 77th Street, David Richardson, an architect and former New Yorker who now lives in Baltimore, said that he was surprised at the paucity of Christmas decorations in some parts of the city and that Baltimore seemed to be the same way this year.
"But it's better than this," said Mr. Richardson, who was in New York visiting friends. "I guess I figured it would be jumping more than this. It seems like New York is on its back."
Audrey Shepps, a video editor who was shopping near 76th Street, agreed. Maybe the weather had something to do with it, she wondered. "There's no Christmas spirit at all," she said. "It's like Miami here."
 
One Wish Come True: A Job
 While a crowd of children lined up to wait for a breakfast with Santa at Lord & Taylor, dozens of adults packed into its personnel office.
Charles Bullitt emerged smiling.
The 30-year-old Mr. Bullitt had been unemployed since January, when he was laid off from his job as sales manager of a shoe department in another store. Last month, his wife was laid off by American Express, so things have been touch-and-go for the Bullitts and their 2-year-old daughter.
Two days ago he was notified that he had been hired as a shoe salesman for Lord & Taylor. He was at the store yesterday filling out paperwork and said he had only one wish for this Christmas: "To be able to get a couple of gifts to give my wife and kid."
 
No 'Ho, Ho, Ho'
 At the Queens Mall, a throng of shoppers swarmed in and out of stores with children in tow.
Jerome McCray, who stood watching a huge teddy bear display with his wife and three children, said the weather was making all the difference this year. "There's some spirit but it's not like when I was growing up," he said. "Then, snow would be on the ground already."
Mary Moraglia of Howard Beach, who works in advertising, stood near a railing waiting for her husband.
"I feel like everything just changed," she said. "It doesn't feel like Christmas anymore. People don't have a 'Ho, ho, ho!' kind of feeling. There's too much stress."

HEADLINE: Old World With One Currency Is New to U.S.

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Though this week's decision by the European Community to adopt a single currency by the end of the decade could affect everything from the dollar's role in global markets to the price of French wine at the local store, the implications for the United States of the action are little known and less discussed.
The Treasury and State departments have barely begun to analyze the issue, and at banks and corporations the thinking on the subject is largely confined to economists and foreign exchange experts. 
 For Americans abroad, the significance of a single currency is clear. "The simple answer is that when traveling in Europe, he does not have to change his money every time he crosses a border," said Horst Schulmann, the managing director of the Institute of International Finance.
But for American consumers at home, the question is more complicated. It rests in part on whether the new currency would supplant the dollar among countries, said Eric A. Feldstein, the treasurer of General Motors' European operations. German cameras and Swiss watches could become expensive.
As for businesses, the answer varies. For David L. Fiedler, the director of foreign exchange planning at Eastman Kodak, which sells film all over the world, a single European currency could simplify his job of preventing the company's overseas profits from being wiped out by exchange rate changes.
For American corporations with large manufacturing operations in Europe, like General Motors, the issue is especially complicated. These companies now spread their parts and assembly plants across Europe, trying to produce goods in the country where they are sold because markets supplied with exports can be easily lost in sudden swings in exchange rates.
Multinational companies are already beginning to concentrate production in a few low-cost countries as they prepare for European customs barriers to fall next year. The decision on whether to consolidate factories further will depend in part on whether the advantages of dealing with fewer currencies offset the risk that inflation rates may vary widely among countries, said Eric A. Feldstein, the treasurer of General Motors' European operations.
For most bankers, corporate executives, economists and Federal officials, however, the opportunities -- or dangers -- are unclear.
Charles H. Dallara, until last summer the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for international affairs, said the Bush Administration had not reflected enough on the implications of a single European currency. "There is hardly time to think, much less reflect, because budget constraints have left the Treasury short on planning staff."
The exact effects of a single European currency would depend on the political independence and foreign currency reserves of a possible European central bank -- two key issues that have not yet been decided.
A weak central bank would allow a high-inflation currency that would tend to devalue slowly against other currencies, thereby reducing its acceptability outside Europe.
On the other hand, if the Europeans can come up with a persuasive means to limit its supply, the new currency might begin to supplant the dollar.
With that erosion could come a slow erosion of the dollar's exchange rate, experts said, and that would tend to make imported products ranging from German cameras to Chinese toys more expensive. But the world's central banks, which according to the International Monetary Fund held $472 billion in dollars and dollar-denominated securities at the end of April, have little incentive to sell large chunks of their reserves. Such selling would push down the dollar's value quickly and leave their remaining holdings worth less, several economists contended.
For American corporations, the immediate effect of a common European currency is likely to be administrative. "I think we could probably do with fewer foreign exchange traders," as well as fewer multiple currency bank accounts and other costs, Mr. Feldstein of General Motors said.

HEADLINE: The Fall Of Gorbachev/A special report.;
A Russian Is Swept Aside By the Forces He Released

BYLINE: By SERGE SCHMEMANN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Looking back now, the August coup was both Mikhail S. Gorbachev's finest moment, and the start of the final act in his tumultuous reign.
The collapse of the pathetic coup was his victory. It demonstrated that the freedoms he had loosed had taken root, and it brought out the qualities of courage and determination that brought about the end of the cold war. 
 But with the collapse of the coup, the last pillars of the old order also collapsed, setting the republics free to partition what remained of the empire and perhaps to seek their destiny in a new commonwealth, not Mr. Gorbachev's.
 
Seven-Year Journey Ends
 Now, the man who set out almost seven years earlier to reform the world's biggest empire finds himself on the verge of being swept aside by the very forces he set loose. And although his Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, was still calling on him today not to resign, it seems more and more certain that he will have to give up the role he has played in exchange for some unknown future.
In the four months since the coup, Mr. Gorbachev seemed to have relived his entire remarkable career. Back on that August night when he returned to Moscow in his tan windbreaker from 72 hours of captivity, the President had seemed aglow with moral triumph, with the conviction of a destiny affirmed.
It was a golden moment, and it seemed that he was aware of this. "They say I've returned to a different country," he said. "I could even say another country."
But once again events seemed to slip past his grasp. He could have gone straight to Boris N. Yeltsin's euphoric White House, home of the Russian republic's government, where the crowds that had faced down the tanks would have hoisted him on their shoulders. He could have embraced Mr. Yeltsin, and with him the new era that had opened.
But when Mr. Gorbachev did appear on the next day, it was at a news conference at which he once again invoked the forgotten Lenin and the tired "socialist choice." He talked of the coup as an attack against him personally -- "The President of the country was isolated from the country and the world. The objective was to crush the President morally, to crush his family, but they failed" -- but he failed to see that people had stood up not for him, but for the freedoms he had enabled them to taste.
By the time he appeared before the Russian Parliament, the sympathy was draining, and the moment was lost. His expressions of gratitude to Mr. Yeltsin sounded forced, as did his acceptance of a measure of responsibility.
From that moment, it seemed, his final course was set. Without the pillars of the old order on which to lean, there was only the strength of his character and the symbolism of his name left to resist the sacking of his "center."
Slowly, inexorably, he changed from a champion of a new order to an obstacle in its way. Instead of a new partnership, he entered on the final collision course with his nemesis and alter-ego, Mr. Yeltsin.
The moment of greatness followed by a maddening stubborness in these last four months seemed almost a replay of a career that both electrified and frustrated his nation and the world.
On coming to power in March 1985, Mr. Gorbachev began processes that nobody could have foreseen. The people of his country were given back the right to think and speak, taboos that had held one-sixth of the world's land mass in thrall were broken, and an East-West confrontation fueled by enough megatons of nuclear arms to pulverize the earth began to lift.
The "new thinking" wrought miracles abroad. Eastern Europe was set free. Soviet troops pulled out of Afghanistan. The cold war came to an end. Mr. Gorbachev was greeted around the world by admiring crowds chanting, "Gorby! Gorby!" He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
 
Fatal Flaw
World Hero Misreads Home
 But at home, from the outset, he seemed incapable of fully comprehending the forces he had released. He tried to impose change from above, the way Communists were taught. He tried to impose a homogeneity on a land when it was only beginning to recover in diversity.
Instead of riding with history, in the uncharitable words of Anatoly A. Sobchak, the St. Petersburg Mayor, "he tried to reform the unreformable." He sought to tailor the pace of reform in society to the evolution of the Communist Party, convinced that the party could be "renewed" and that socialism could be made to function.
Again and again, he accepted the inevitable only when it was too late. He resisted every vital change -- private property, radical economic reform, the ouster of the Communist party, power-sharing with the republics -- until the country came to the edge of chaos. He bullied and bloodied the Baltic states until they were left with no choice but to leave the union entirely. He resisted federation and power-sharing until the centrifugal forces became all but unmanageable.
Proud and stubborn, he drove his most devoted comrades away and surrounded himself with Communist toadies, and he refused to sack them even when men like Eduard A. Shevardnadze, his Foreign Minister, and Aleksandr N. Yakovlev, a well-trusted top aide, screamed that they were plotting against him.
That Mr. Gorbachev already has carved out a deep niche in history is self-evident. But whether historians prove to be as tolerant as his contemporaries have been depends to a great deal on the fate of the processes he set loose.
If they fail -- if the Soviet land disintegrates into chaos, famine, civil war, fascist dictatorship or some other horror -- he may go down in history as the man who missed the opportunities. If they succeed, chronicles may record him as a visionary who managed to ease out the world's most formidable totalitarian dictatorship.
Today, to those now watching spellbound as he ponders his exit, he appears a tragic hero, a giant whose decline and fall stem from the same qualities that raised him to greatness: self-confidence and stubborness bordering on arrogance; pride that defied humiliation but made him deaf to critics; a decency and morality that gained him trust, but made it hard for him to shed the illusory humanitarianism of the Marxist faith.
He is a child of the Soviet 60's, a generation that still believed that the romantic Leninist faith could be melded with the democracy and market forces of the West. It was a generation that refused to accept that the failures of the system were inherent in the ideology. In the words of Aleksandr Bovin, the new Soviet Ambassador to Israel and himself a product of the 60's, it was a generation that "wanted its sausage and its freedom, too."
 
Early Euphoria
Old Guard Out, Glasnost In
 Mr. Gorbachev came to power convinced that the sausage would come with the freedom. He was not alone in that belief. Many in the West also seemed convinced in those less complicated times that if only a breath of openness was allowed into what President Reagan called the "evil empire," people were certain to recognize the error of their ways and to choose happiness and prosperity.
The accession of Mr. Gorbachev, then 54 years old, was accompanied by enormous hoopla at home and abroad. The "old guard" had literally expired at the controls with the rapid-fire deaths of three Soviet leaders, Leonid I. Brezhnev, Yuri V. Andropov and Konstantin U. Chernenko.
Simply by being young and alive, Mr. Gorbachev represented a dramatic change. He did not disappoint. He plunged into the streets to preach a new gospel of "glasnost" -- openness. He ousted the corrupt old guard and brought in a team of decent, honest men, among them Mr. Yeltsin. He also declared war on vodka, which was highly symbolic in a land where drink had become a widely sought refuge. He promised far-reaching reform that would bring prosperity.
The euphoria was palpable as the dark truths of the Soviet past were brought to light. Soon other chains began to lift. The great dissident Andrei D. Sakharov returned to Moscow, Anatoly Shcharansky was released, hundreds of other dissidents were set free, the arts bloomed and religious faiths were set free. Intellectuals sang the praises of the new leader, while dissidents in China and Eastern Europe made his name a rallying cry.
The new era quickly spread beyond the Soviet borders. Eight months after coming to power, in November 1985, Mr. Gorbachev met in Geneva with President Reagan, signaling a new era in East-West relations.
With Mr. Shevardnadze at the Foreign Ministry, Soviet foreign policy entered an era of "new thinking." Nuclear arsenals were sharply reduced, the Afghan war was brought to an end, Germany was reunited, and the Iron Curtain became a curiosity for souvenir hunters.
At home, Soviet citizens voted for the first time in multi-party elections in 1989, granting seats in Parliament to Mr. Sakharov and other reformers, and the Communist Party formally surrendered its monopoly on power in February 1990.
 
The Decline
Economy Sinks And Yeltsin Rises
 But by this point the decline had also become clear. By his fifth anniversary in power in March 1990, Mr. Gorbachev was on the defensive. People now grumbled openly about the failed promises of economic reform. In response to Lithuania's declaration of independence, the President ordered an economic blockade, setting in motion a chain of events that would lead to bloodshed in January 1991.
His supporters argued ever louder that Mr. Gorbachev required a genuine popular mandate through national presidential elections to gather the strength needed for the radical reforms needed to save the economy. Instead, he sought and got a more powerful executive presidency for himself.
The first signs of disarray had already appeared long before. However great the changes in society, the economy continued to deteriorate, gripped by a jealous party bureaucracy that smothered efforts at reform. By his first anniversary in office Mr. Gorbachev was already railing at bureaucrats and red-tape.
Soon Mr. Yeltsin and other critics began to accuse Mr. Gorbachev of being too soft, too slow. Instead of heeding him, Mr. Gorbachev dismissed Mr. Yeltsin in November 1987. It would prove a fateful decision. Cut off from all traditional sources of power, spurning the party, Mr. Yeltsin would become the first major leader to rise via the newly opened route of democracy and politics in the republics.
The lifting of the lid off long-suppressed national ambitions also fired new independence movements in the Baltic republics, Georgia and Ukraine, and reopened ancient feuds between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
At the May Day parade in 1990, conservatives and liberals alike jeered Mr. Gorbachev. Soon after, Mr. Yeltsin won election to the Russian presidency, giving him a powerful new platform from which to combat Mr. Gorbachev and touching off a debilitating "war of presidents" that would end with troops in the streets of Moscow.
The end game probably dates from the summer of 1990, when Mr. Gorbachev rejected the "500-day program" of radical reform prepared by a group of liberal economists who wanted to speed the nation toward a free-market economy.
As Mr. Gorbachev's support among liberals waned, he turned increasingly to a clutch of uninspired party conservatives to run his Government. In December his closest comrade, Mr. Shevardnadze, quit with a dire warning of an impending coup. In January tanks took over the television tower in Lithuania, killing 14 people. In March when a pro-Yeltsin rally was scheduled, 50,000 troops converged on Moscow to prevent it.
Finally, in April, Mr. Gorbachev tried to turn back from the path he had taken away from his reform-minded advisers. Turning back to his old supporters, he gathered with leaders of nine republics to negotiate a new Union Treaty. But this one last attempt to change course abruptly proved too late.
On Aug. 19, the conservatives he had brought into the Kremlin put him under house arrest and declared martial law. It was a pathetic attempt, terribly planned by men oblivious to the degree to which fear had been lifted from society in the six years of glasnost.
Immediately after the coup, Mr. Gorbachev unleashed a quick torrent of measures that seemed to conjure up the Gorbachev of the summer past. In its wake, he suspended the party, dismised his Cabinet, purged the K.G.B., created a new power-sharing State Council and recognized the Baltic states. He seemed to be moving toward a new Union Treaty, with a new lease on life for himself, as disoriented republic presidents huddled around the Kremlin, alarmed at the prospect of chaotic disintegration. In this post-coup period, he even had a last hurrah on the international stage like the Gorbachev of old, when he matched President Bush's sweeping cuts of tactical weapons in early October.
But soon it became evident that suspiciousness of a new center across the nation outweighed all the arguments for it. When Ukraine finally declared that it would have no part of any new Moscow-based federation or agreement, and when its residents voted overwhelmingly for independence at the beginning of December, the union was finished.
It remained for Mr. Yeltsin to join with the leaders of Ukraine and Byelorussia last week to sign a death warrant for the old union and to proclaim a new commonwealth. Other republics, at first wary of the "Slavic union," soon flocked to the new banner. But this time, there was no room for Mr. Gorbachev.
 
Godunov's Fate
'Hunger, Plague, Fear and Ruin'
 In a nation that seeks precedent in literature, not in history, Mr. Gorbachev's fate oddly paralleled the lot of the 16th-century Czar whose portrait was drawn by the poet Pushkin in "Boris Godunov," and made by Moussorgsky into the most Russian of all operas.
Anguished by mounting troubles in his kingdom, the Czar broods over his fate in these lines:
I have attained the highest power,
 For the sixth year now do I rule in peace.
 Yet my tortured soul can find no happiness. . . .
 Here there is conspiracy, there sedition of the boyars,
 Lithuanian plots and secret machinations,
 Hunger and plague, fear and ruin. . . .
 Like wild beasts the people roam, stricken with disease!
 Russia groans in hunger and poverty!
The image of Boris Godunov anguishing over his fate as the end drew near seemed particularly tempting when Soviet television showed Mr. Gorbachev's three-hour session with Soviet reporters this week, a meeting many took as a farewell.
Ranging broadly over his record and the abrupt chain of events that had suddenly brought him to this turn, Mr. Gorbachev was at times angry, at times thoughtful, at times almost lighthearted -- and at times the familiar, wordy preacher.
Never a man given to self-pity or to displays of emotion, he was still in control, still coldly analytical, still proud of his achievements, and proudly firm that he and he alone would decide when it was time to exit from the stage.
He reiterated his conviction that the new Commonwealth marked a disastrous dissolution of the state he had tried so hard to preserve. But it was equally clear that he was steeling himself for the inevitable:
"I will resign. If the process ends this way I will resign. This is absolutely clear, no question. I am a moral man. Some of these new ones, I don't see morality."
There were also flashes of the Communist faith that Mr. Gorbachev could never fully shake.
He insisted that the party's rank and file could not be blamed for the sins of its leaders, and he argued that the original impetus for change came from the party, saying: "It was in the party that those very forces were born which had the boldness to launch these reforms. They did not have to. My generation, which came to power at its peak, could have assured itself of 10 peaceful years."
But as the conversation ranged back and forth, it seemed that both the President was groping for some deeper explanation, some clearer understanding of how things had come to this pass.
"I did all I could," Mr. Gorbachev said, almost with resignation. "You know, I think in my place others would have long quit this business."
He seemed conscious that he had fallen short somewhere, but if he was slow to order change, he argued, it was because he himself could change no faster. It would be easier for his daughter's generation, he said, adding: "We were already formed, and we began this process already when we were ripe. It is not so easy to break oneself. The most difficult thing is to break oneself."
In any case, he declared more than once, the main goal had been achieved: people had been irreversibly changed. "For all the mistakes, miscalculations, or on the contrary for all the great leaps, we accomplished the main preparatory political and human work," he said. "In this sense it will never be possible to turn society back. It cannot be penned in again by any force."
And yet as he spoke, it seemed that dark doubts stirred in the background. A man of strong principles and strong nerves, he seemed to be alarmed not by the specter of resignation but by the thought that his life's work might be in peril.
"Am I happy?" he mused. "A great task fell to my lot. I believe that I fulfilled it, that it came to be. The main achievement of my life has come to pass, and all the rest... Maybe others will come, maybe they will do more. But understand, I want this to succeed. This is my peculiarity: I do not want it to fail."

HEADLINE: A Day After the Jury's Vote, Miller Feels Fatalistic

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 14

 BODY:
Mel Miller, whose 21-year career in state politics was vaporized Friday night by the lightning strike of a jury's verdict, said today that he viewed his conviction with the same fatalism he feels when watching voters go to the polls.
"It's like losing an election," the former Assembly Speaker said in a telephone interview from his home in Brooklyn. "It's terrible. It's awful. But it's over. It happened. It's gone." 
 Mr. Miller and Jay Adolf, his former law partner and legislative aide, were convicted late Friday afternoon of 8 of the 19 Federal charges against them in a case in which the two were accused of cheating legal clients out of some of the profits from investments in cooperative apartments. Mr. Miller has yet to be sentenced and plans to appeal, but state law requires the immediate expulsion of legislators convicted of a felony.
An irrepressibly brash and flamboyant leader who was the consummate master of Albany's inside political game, Mr. Miller chose to view the verdict in electoral terms.
"We came in having to win all 19," Mr. Miller said, referring to the counts against him. "We won the majority but this was a case where the majority wasn't enough."
 
His Own Voice
 Even as his former Democratic colleagues were orchestrating the ascension of Assemblyman Saul Weprin of Queens as the new Speaker, Mr. Miller spent some time reflecting today on the legacy he left behind.
He said he was proudest of his ability to transform the Assembly, which now has a 94-to-55 Democratic majority, into a more substantive policy-making body, particularly on fiscal issues. He also said he was pleased to have given junior members of the Assembly majority a greater voice in the chamber's decision-making process and to have assembled a staff that is admired for its competence and professionalism.
Aided by his staff and his own encyclopedic mastery of the state budget, Mr. Miller made the Assembly an incubator for fiscal policies that often provided an alternative -- albeit a Democratic one -- to those of the Cuomo administration. He also relished his role as a guardian of New York City's interests and as a strong leader of his Democratic caucus who was not intimidated by Mr. Cuomo.
"He'll be remembered for nurturing a Legislature that became the equal of the executive in many ways," said Norman Adler, a political consultant who served as an assistant to Mr. Miller at the beginning of his tenure as Speaker.
 
Pushed Tax Cuts, Increases
 In 1987, Mr. Miller's first year as Speaker, he pushed for a multi-year cut in the personal income tax that Mr. Cuomo signed reluctantly after warning that it was too large. The tax cut is now widely considered to have contributed to the state's recurring budget gaps and the final phase has been postponed for two consecutive years.
When the state had to fill a huge budget gap last year, Mr. Miller proposed raising income taxes on the wealthy, another plan that was opposed vigorously by Mr. Cuomo. The two Democrats and the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, a Republican from Long Island, eventually agreed to a modest income tax increase to break a lengthy deadlock over the state budget.
In another battle with the Governor, Mr. Miller backed an ethics bill in 1987 that Mr. Cuomo did not find sufficiently stringent. The Governor vetoed the bill and initiated a public relations assault on the ethics standards of the Legislature, which left a mark on Mr. Miller.
The criminal charges against Mr. Miller had nothing to do with his duties as a legislator. But several legislators said Friday's verdict, which was the fourth felony conviction of a legislator in the last four years, would reinforce a loss of public trust in the state's elected officials.
 
Little Shift in Ideologya
 Legislators said they expected little shift in the Assembly's liberal ideology under Mr. Weprin, who like Mr. Miller is a supporter of abortion rights and an opponent of the death penalty. But they predicted a significant change in style.
Many Democratic legislators said they expected Mr. Weprin to be less dogmatic and more of a consensus-builder than Mr. Miller, who ruled by the combined force of his knowledge and his personality. Mr. Weprin is far more easygoing than his predecessor and more likely to delegate responsibility to his staff, they said.
"He's a mellow guy," said one New York City legislator, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "He doesn't like conflict. But he's very shrewd. He likes subtlety. I think he'll be softer, but I think he'll be a different person once in office in ways I can't predict now."
An upstate legislator summed up the differences between Mr. Miller and Mr. Weprin this way: "Mel couldn't stop talking and he couldn't listen. Saul listens great."
 
'A Very Technical Case'
 Even today, Mr. Miller did not stop talking. Although physically and emotionally drained, he seemed in good spirits after a day of fielding telephone calls from well-wishers. One anonymous caller, he conceded, told him, "You deserved what you got."
Mr. Miller said he took his traditional morning jog, went shopping and rearranged the books on a bookcase. The only departure from his usual Saturday morning routine was that he could not convince Mr. Adolf to keep their regular tennis date.
He continued to maintain his innocence. "From the day we were indicted, I think Jay and I both realized that the probability of winning was not heavy," he said. "It was a very technical case. But I don't think I committed a crime. I never had any intention of defrauding anybody."
Mr. Miller, who faces a maximum sentence of 40 years in prison and fines of up to $2 million, said he would hope for a favorable sentence, leave the details of his appeal to his lawyers, and begin thinking about the rest of his life. He will be disbarred if the conviction sticks, but he said he has no plans to continue practicing law in any event.
Even with the help of a legal defense fund mounted by his friends, the 52-year-old Mr. Miller predicted that he will still owe at least a half-million dollars in legal fees. Although he said he has no assets other than his house and retirement accounts, he said he was not worried about either money or future employment.
"I can drive a cab," he joked. "I'm crazy enough to drive in New York City. I'm eligible for a modest pension. My wife Liz is still working. I've got a daughter who is making a lot of money. She said she'd send me $10 a week allowance. I suppose somebody in the country will find that I have some value."
Mr. Miller said he would not spend time second-guessing his failures. "It's like trying to analyze why you lost a race," he said. "You sit and analyze it for two years but it doesn't change the result. The hardest thing for me to do is I can't figure out what I'm supposed to do Monday."

HEADLINE: SOVIET DISARRAY;
Yeltsin Sees Food Baskets 'Two-Thirds' Full in a Year

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 14

 BODY:
President Boris N. Yeltsin of the Russian republic, calling on the people of the crumbled Soviet Union to rally for a grim period of transition, promised in an interview published today to stabilize the economy in a year and have food baskets "two-thirds filled, not more."
"The main thing is trust," he said in the newspaper interview in which he set basic national goals to survive what he conceded would prove a very difficult year. 
 "No pessimism," said Mr. Yeltsin as he prepared to start his plans for reconstruction. "Don't lose hope. This is what is most important today."
In the interview, Mr. Yeltsin made his first broad pledges to the public since the republics put their future hopes in a commonwealth association. As the elected leader of Russia, the republic that is by far the largest part of the ocmmonwealth, and the chief political force behind the new union, he acknowledged that times would be hard and talked in the most simple food-basket terms as he sought to bolster public morale in the interview with the newspaper Trud.
 
'We Know Where to Head'
 "I promise the food basket of a Russian citizen in one year's period will be two-thirds filled, not more," he said. "But we will do our best that it won't be less than two-thirds, irrespective of price rises, and we won't allow any hunger."
Conceding that his popularity will dip in the coming harder days, Mr. Yeltsin vowed to have the reeling economy stablized within a year.
"Gradually in the five following years we'll start increasing living standards," he told a public desperately in need of fresh confidence.
"As President I see these goals," he said. "We know where to head and we are sure that we will achieve these goals."
 
Complaints of Gorbachev
 Severe tests are fast approaching for Mr. Yeltsin's free-market economic reforms and commonwealth plan, with consumer prices expected to be free to rise on Jan. 2 after seven decades of state subsidies. Those transformations will key market changes in other republics of the new Commonwealth of Independent States, which Mr. Yeltsin and the leaders of Ukraine and Byelorussia proclaimed a week ago and which has since been endorsed by most former Soviet republics.
Mr. Yeltsin's interview was published as Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d headed here today from Washington to survey the latest survival plan of the collapsed Soviet empire, already on notice that he must face the complaints of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev that the Bush Administration has proved disloyal to him as Soviet President.
In an interview released today, Mr. Gorbachev said: "Mr. Baker was overly hasty in saying 'The Soviet Union no longer exists.' While we're still trying to figure things out, the United States seems to know everything already."
"I don't think this is loyalty," he said in the interview with Time magazine. "Particularly for those who favor partnership and full-fledged cooperation. It is our common interest that this process should end successfully without any surprises."
 
Union Treaty Plan
 As politicians awaited Mr. Gorbvachev's resignation, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze, estimating that social tensions were increasing, said he had urged Mr. Gorbachev "not to rush into any resignation."
Endorsing the commonwealth, Mr. Shevardnadze said he believed President Gorbachev "can do many useful things for this process."
But Mr. Gorbachev, in an interview today in the paper Nezavisimaya Gazeta, once more raised the subject of somehow salvaging within the commonwealth some part of his proposed union-treaty agreement.
That treaty's chances were dashed by the republics' choice of a commonwealth approach that eliminates the central union state to which Mr. Gorbachev still clings. He talked of possibly blending the two in a "joint understanding," but the republics already have made clear that they want no part of reviving the union idea.
 
Call for U.S. Aid
 Mr. Gorbachev has continued to give no hint of when he might quit and he has maintained that his presidential role is still needed to insure an orderly, lawful transition in government.
"I want a stage-by-stage, step-by-step process that will not stimulate chaos," he told Time magazine.
In the interview, the Soviet leader, who is generally considered likely to resign soon as the commonwealth plan takes effect, issued his most urgent plea thus far for United States aid.
"We need your help now," he said. "Immediately. Stop hesitating or we will all have to pay a greater price in the end. If you have given aid to Poland and Hungary, Russia certainly deserves it."
On Thursday, Mr. Gorbachev was quoted as saying he would be obliged to resign if the republics did not revive the old union. But on Friday, politicans said he was likely to stay to meet Mr. Baker after he arrives Sunday.
 
Soviet Military Loyalty
 On the military front, the Soviet Defense Minister issued a statement calling for continued military allegiance to Moscow. In the face of continuing suggestions by Ukraine that the government in Kiev intends to take over army units on Ukrainian soil, Defense Minister Yevgeny Shaposhnikov issued a statement saying that all units of the Soviet military should stay loyal to him.
President Yeltsin conceded in his interview that, with free-market elements expected to aggravate the inflationary spiral further, the government is preparing to distribute free food to the large part of the nation trying to survive below the poverty line.
"I don't think there can be any talk of civil war or interference by the military," the Russian republic's leader said, tersely rejecting the warnings of President Gorbachev about the dangers of the new commonwealth.
In interviews all week, Mr. Gorbachev has portrayed himself as trying to prevent trouble for the republics' transition, not invite it by his opposition to the commonwealth.

HEADLINE: Jobs Make Ireland's Young People a Resource

BYLINE: By JAMES F. CLARITY

DATELINE: DUBLIN, Dec. 14

 BODY:
In 1729 Jonathan Swift satirically proposed dealing with this country's essential problem by eating Irish children -- "a reasonable dish, and seasoned with a little pepper or salt." Today the country's overbearing problem is still too many children.
Ireland has the youngest population in Europe, half of it under 30 years old; its women lead Europe in child-bearing ratios in a nation where abortion is illegal and the dominant Roman Catholic Church inveighs constantly against contraception. 
 But now the Government is meeting with some success in insuring enough jobs for its young work force. After centuries in which the only hope seemed to lie in emigration by the millions to Britain, the United States and Australia, it has been gradually creating more work at home by attracting foreign companies here.
They are being lured by tax breaks, low labor costs, few problems with unions and the prospect of a foothold in the single-market European Community. American companies provide the major share of the work, with 45,000 employees in 357 companies.
Corporate taxes for American companies here are no more than 10 percent on profits until the year 2010, and in many instances the Government, through the Industrial Development Authority, pays the first year of wages.
While the foreign presence alone will not vitalize the weak Irish economy, it is a bright spot for a work force of 1.2 million people saddled with an unemployment rate of 20 percent and the prospect of fewer jobs abroad as a result of the global recession.
Irish had been emigrating at an annual pace of 30,000 until last year; now net emigration is at zero, the amount of money being sent back home is decreasing, and tens of thousands of young people are leaving schools each year without much hope of finding jobs.
But Ireland, according to the Minister for Trade and Commerce, Desmond O'Malley, is trying to turn its youth into an asset.
"We have a guaranteed educated population into the next century, " he said in an interview. "We have the only indigenous population in Europe that is growing. Germany is running out of young Germans, for example."
Irish officials and foreign commercial and economic experts say that few countries in Europe, or anywhere, can offer such a combination of educated, English-speaking, ambitious workers at such a low cost.
The American industrial presence can be felt virtually everywhere.
In Dublin's Financial Services Center, there are units of Citibank Corp. and Black & Decker, General Electric Co., IBM and others. Operating through Irish subsidiaries, they are preparing to increase their share of business in the 12-nation European Community as it moves toward a single market of 340 million people.
In Cork and Kerry and Galway, the insurance companies Metropolitan Life, New York Life and Cigna and others employ several hundred people to process claims. The claims are flown to Ireland overnight, where workers here tap into computers in the States and calculate payments that are then made back at the home office. The companies avoid high American wages and get more use out of their New York computers in the off-hours.
In Cork, Apple Computer Inc. employs 950 people in its expanding production of laptop computers.
In Limerick, Dell Computer Co. opened in April and now employs 200 people. One of them is Linda Cowell, a secretary who was lured away from a competing firm by Dell's salary and working conditions.
"This is lively here," she said. "You work hard, but they're a good bunch to work for. The other place, things were getting stale." She said the pay at Dell was better than what most of the young people working there could find anywhere in the area.
The director of the bright, quiet computer assembly plant is Buddy Griffin, a 42-year-old native Irish engineer who was recruited personally by 26-year-old Michael Dell, who created the the Austin, Texas, company.
"We've a bunch of enthusiastic kids who want to work," Mr. Griffin said. He said that the starting salary for an assembly worker was about $12,000.

HEADLINE: New York Backs Columbus Center Plan in Court

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN

 BODY:
Lawyers for New York City -- which is counting on the millions that a huge development planned for Columbus Circle would generate for mass transit -- are arguing before a Federal appeals court that it makes no sense to block the project just because environmental inspectors found high levels of carbon monoxide on the other side of Central Park.
"It does not make sense to hold this project hostage for a problem it has nothing to do with," Linda Young, an assistant Corporation Counsel, argued in Federal court on Friday. The city is seeking to overturn an order issued last summer that effectively halted a project that is now also threatened by declining economic conditions. 
 In a July 10 ruling sought by opponents of the plan, Judge Shirley Wohl Kram of Federal District Court ruled that it could go forward. But she said it could be halted if the city failed to meet a Nov. 15, 1992, deadline to produce an air-quality plan that would comply with standards set in the Federal Clean Air Act.
Judge Kram also said she would fine the city at least $15 million if the deadline were not met. Her ruling was appealed by the city to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard opposing arguments on Friday.
The plan involves the demolition of the New York Coliseum and the sale of a surrounding 4.5-acre tract, owned by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, to a company headed by Mortimer B. Zuckerman, who would then build a 2.2-million-square-foot Columbus Center.
When first proposed in 1985, the center included twin 925-foot towers -- one commercial and one residential -- that critics said would cast long and forbidding shadows across the southwest corner of the park and sabotage the city's efforts to clean its air as ordered by the Federal Government.
The latest plan has scaled the towers down to 752 feet. But with the stubborn recession and the growing oversupply of Manhattan office space, developers question whether Mr. Zuckerman can attract enough large commercial tenants to make the project profitable.
 
Hot Spot Across the Park
 A spokesman for Mr. Zuckerman's real-estate company, Boston Properties, previously described Judge Kram's ruling as "a very serious blow to the viability and future of the project."
A crucial argument advanced by lawyers representing the Coalition Against Columbus Center and the Committee for Enviromentally Sound Development was that the project would worsen a so-called hot spot of vehicle-generated carbon monoxide air pollution centered on East 59th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues 3 1/2 blocks from the site.
 
Citywide Compliance Sought
 Moreover, they argued that major projects like the one at Columbus Circle should be halted until the entire city is in compliance with Federal air quality standards.
But Ms. Young argued that the project "had nothing to do with that problem on 59th Street." She also argued that Congress had extended the Federal deadline for compliance to 1995.
But in her ruling last summer, Judge Kram said the city had consistently missed previous Federal deadlines and appeared headed toward missing the one set for next year.

HEADLINE: BACKTALK;
New York Plays Timekeeper and Turns Back the Clock

BYLINE: By MALCOLM MORAN

 BODY:
The guests in tuxedos and elegant dresses were stacked from the floor of the Grand Ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria in balconies nearly all the way to the ceiling. From South Bend and Columbus, the people had come; from State College and Norman and Los Angeles and Tallahassee and Gainesville and Lincoln.
Many of the names, when introduced at the annual dinner for the National Football Foundation and College Hall of Fame, were instantly recognizable: Paterno, Bowden, Majors, Spurrier, Cozza, Curry. Gifford, Conerly, Rote, Cassady, Griese, all of them in New York, the center of the college football universe, if only for little more than a week. 
 That is about all that is left these days, a period that began with the dinner last Tuesday night and concludes with the Heisman dinner this Tuesday night. Once, the city was the glittering focus of college football on the field and off. New York was N.Y.U. and Fordham, or Gene Rossides to Bill Swiacki pushing Columbia past Army. In recent years, Heisman recipients could not make it to New York for the announcement, appearing only on television screens, via satellite, because of football business conducted elsewhere.
 
Fight Songs Made Fancy
 The room at the Waldorf was transported to that earlier time, with spotlights and tuxedos, candlelight and chandeliers. Fight songs, played by an orchestra, suddenly sounded almost elegant. Memories, some originally in black and white, were colorized.
These tuxedos and dresses had come from a time when it was easier to accept the notion that football was a gentlemen's game, demanding qualities that translated to success in business and politics and victory in war. Look at the organization's gold-medal winners: Eisenhower, MacArthur, Hoover, Kennedy, Nixon, Reagan, Ford, and this year, a baseball guy named Bush.
Any such notions might have seemed more acceptable because the times were as relatively simple as the day's short list of New Year's Day bowl games. It was not politically correct to examine the percentage of players with meaningful college degrees, or to question the techniques used to obtain these athletes, or to wonder about the glaring absence of black students on too many teams.
Super-slo-mo had not yet been developed to reveal the extent of the violence and the details of how the bodies are broken. And economics had not yet forced most private schools to re-evaluate their ambitions, or just get out of the game.
 
Banners on the Balconies
 The balconies at the Waldorf were covered with the multicolored banners from the days when big-time football was a different business: Manhattan, Marquette, Santa Clara, Holy Cross, Georgetown, Fordham, alongside the major-conference schools of then, and now.
Scoreless ties -- "Much ado about nothing to nothing" -- linked programs that have since headed in different philosophical and economic directions: Fordham and Pittsburgh, three times; Army and Notre Dame in the glare of No. 1 vs. No. 2 in a packed Yankee Stadium; and Columbia and Stanford at the Polo Grounds in 1937, the third Lion shutout over Stanford in a coast-to-coast three-game series.
For one night, the room belonged to a time when major league sports had advanced no farther west than St. Louis and no farther south than Washington, leaving cities as big as Atlanta, Minneapolis and Los Angeles as sporting outposts -- except in the fall. And when teams were ready to make a national impact, coaches would remind their stars, before or during the train ride east or north, that if they wanted to become all-Americans, New York was the place to start.
After New York writers created a campaign to have Columbia play in the 1934 Rose Bowl, KF-79 -- Al Barabas's naked reverse that shocked Stanford -- became a joyous secret code for Lions everywhere to celebrate their upset victory in Pasadena.
When Fordham beat Missouri in the Sugar Bowl, 2-0, in the rain 50 years ago this Jan. 1, Kate Smith rooted for the Rams, Joe E. Brown conducted the band, and William Frawley became a fan, long before television made him into Fred Mertz.
And when the Rams returned home and Toots Shor held a party, a backup center named Jerry O'Brien -- a backup center -- sat between two people and made the discovery of a lifetime. To his left sat Gary Cooper; to his right, Joe DiMaggio.
Half a century later, Joe Paterno, child of Brooklyn, stood in a spotlight and accepted the foundation's Distinguished American Award, a distinction that had once gone to Archibald MacLeish, Vince Lombardi, Bob Hope and Jimmy Stewart. "When you're from Brooklyn," Paterno said, "being called a distinguished American is really significant." And everyone laughed.
But he also said how much it meant "to come to New York, to this banquet, and realize that what is important to me is shared by all of you."
 
The Gun Sounds
 Soon there were cabs to catch, and tuxedos to return, and everyone went out into the New York night, into another world. The tuxedos will be gone soon, headed for business at places such as the Orange Bowl, where the Manhattan Jaspers remain an enduring trivia question.
Nearly 60 years ago, Manhattan College became an attraction in something called the Palm Festival, an opportunity for Miami to use a football game to attract curious snowbirds. The Jaspers were imported to face the University of Miami, an institution in its infancy, trying to fight its way out of bankruptcy.
Manhattan's guarantee of $3,000 was secured only after the promoter, Earnie Seiler, made the Miami chief of police the game's finance chairman, and a roundup of local bookmakers produced the money. The University of Miami outlasted bankruptcy and saw its football program advance all the way to the 1962 Gotham Bowl at Yankee Stadium. It was a frigid, barren occasion held after Fordham and N.Y.U. had gotten out of the business, and it is best remembered only as a tribute to its survivors.

HEADLINE: Sports of The Times;
Laughter Came First, Then Change

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY

 BODY:
THEY were proud and they were good and they won every championship there was. Now they are running out of money and they are running out of resolve, with a bitter winter facing them.
No, no, no, we are not talking about the Yankees, that tottering baseball team. We are talking about that other formerly arrogant giant, the sports machine of the Soviet Union, or whatever is left of it. 
 The news came out of Moscow a week ago Friday, that the central government could no longer subsidize sport. The Olympic committee apparently has funds to send a team to Albertville, France, in February, and probably to Barcelona, Spain, in late July. After that, who knows?
Tell me there is no more Pan American, the airline that sent clippers winging across the Atlantic. Tell me there is no more NBC Radio News, no more three chimes that sounded like the American version of Big Ben. Tell me that raiders killed department stores you thought would last forever. "Unbelievable," I will mutter, yet this is the way it goes in the shark pond of capitalism.
But Gossport? Gossport was the most powerful national sports agency in the world. It financed all those gold medals, all those trophies, the ones that substituted for meat and shoes.
The premise was always that "the people" would support all the swimmers and the skaters, but the premise was ultimately wrong, once "the people" began to have a voice in it. They stood up to tanks in Moscow last summer; somehow they also stood up to subsidizing athletes.
Laughter was the first sign that even sports could be affected by the changes. I remember the laughter from 1988, when Arvidas Sabonis, the basketball center, said he would speak only Lithuanian and English from now on. Russian was the language of the invaders, the oppressors, and he was not going to speak it anymore.
Sabonis came to New York for a news conference and he made jokes that 41 road games in the National Basketball Association could not be as grueling as 20 road games in the stark Soviet Union.
"We always told jokes," Sabonis said in halting English. "They just weren't as loud." Asked if he wasn't afraid of the heavy hitters in Gossport, Sabonis laughed, a deep, throaty laugh. They needed him because he is 7 feet 3 1/4 inches tall, so he laughed at them.
Lithuania did not have a team in 1988, not yet, so four Lithuanians helped the Soviet Union outplay and outthink an American college team en route to a gold medal. Next June, at a 16-team tournament in Spain, Lithuania and a team from the shell of the Soviet Union will battle for four places in the 1992 Summer Games. Nobody will be laughing if Lithuania should meet the mostly Russians. The revolution finally caught up with sports.
"For us, medals were ideological weapons," said Sergei Guskov, a marketing official from Moscow, and a former member of sports committees, who happens to be visiting the United States.
"In my country, sports are very conservative; there was no perestroika for a long time," Guskov added, using Mikhail Gorbachev's familiar Russian word for restructuring. "The trade unions paid for sport because gold medals were our face, but now the unions cannot pay anymore."
Guskov, who has a doctorate in sports economics, said even popular sports lose money. The budget in first-division soccer is approximately 20 million rubles, which is nearly impossible to compare with American dollars. But the gate from 4.3 million fans at 2.50 rubles per ticket is only 10.75 million rubles, barely half the budget, Guskov added.
Plus, Aeroflot or Lada cars are not exactly paying huge amounts of rubles for advertising, the way our Western "benefactors" do, so all of Soviet sport is scrambling to stay alive. Gossport used to demand all the dollars its athletes won out of the country, but feisty Natalya Zvereva and other tennis players rebelled.
We had an insight into Soviet sports realities a few years ago when Tamara Bykova, the worldly high jumper and a trained journalist, came to New York for a meet. My wife escorted Bykova to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where they visited the gallery of designer clothes.
"I have one like that," Bykova said, pointing to a lovely Italian gown. She had been to Italy 17 times. She dressed well. And before getting back on Aeroflot, Bykova and her teammates visited a Russian-speaking electronics store in Brooklyn, to spend every dollar while it still had value.
"It is funny you mention Bykova," Guskov said. "I did a survey of our top athletes a few years ago. In the U.S. you call them state amateurs, and that is a fair term. I asked how many of them considered themselves professionals, and 49 percent of them said they were. Bykova answered that she was an amateur because the level of support was amateur."
And that was when Gossport was solvent. Nowadays, to bring dollars into Russia, the authorities have opened the foreign-currency stores to elite athletes, selling Japanese electronics goods at favorable prices. But who will subsidize perks like state apartments and state cars and state pensions for sports heroes? And who will locate and train the next generation of athletes? The system is tapping out. Unbelievable.

HEADLINE: In the Nation;
Mr. Bush's Socks

BYLINE: By TOM WICKER

 BODY:
Anyone who expected a new chief of staff to produce a fast turnaround in White House attitudes toward the slumping national economy must have been disappointed last week by testimony from President Bush's principal economic advisers.
They told the Senate Finance Committee that the President might propose an investment tax credit for business -- but only for some investments. 
 The Secretary of the Treasury, the budget director and the chairman of Mr. Bush's Council of Economic Advisers called once more for a capital-gains tax reduction. They said they were considering but were not committed to a tax break for the middle class, and squarely opposed a tax increase on higher incomes.
If Mr. Bush decides on any kind of tax action, he'll let Congress and the nation know in next month's State of the Union and Budget Messages.
If that's urgency, what would apathy be like?
It's not that a tax credit for investment is a bad idea; the tax code included such a credit most of the time from 1961 to 1986. But if Mr. Bush won't even propose the idea -- even if he decides in favor of it -- until next month, many months more would pass before anyone could be assisted.
Congress would take time to act -- perhaps a lot of time because, under the present budget agreement, any revenues to be lost would have to be made up by tax increases somewhere else, or by spending cuts. Businesses would need further time to plan and make investments, particularly since the credit would be available only for those not already scheduled.
Still more time then would be required for such investments actually to put people to work. Besides, even a tax credit might not persuade business people to make costly new investments when consumers seem to have so little confidence in the economy.
That was evidenced once again in the Commerce Department's report that retail sales rose only three-tenths of a percent in November, as holiday shopping supposedly began -- a statistic that anyone can verify empirically by checking the uncrowded aisles of department and other stores. And retail sales account for a third of all economic activity.
As for the future, the 24-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development is reported to have again lowered its estimate of U.S. economic growth for 1992. Ten weeks ago, it forecast 3.1 percent growth; in two revisions, that figure has fallen to 2.2 percent.
Because of such gloomy economic news, Samuel Skinner, the new White House chief of staff, pointedly said he would focus on action to stimulate the national economy. He hardly has had time to have much impact on policy, but the Administration's testimony to the Finance Committee suggests that Mr. Skinner may need a good deal more than time to achieve his goal.
The economic advisers, while paying lip service to the need for helping middle- and working-class Americans, seemed more concerned about the rich. They not only touted again a capital-gains tax break and ruled out a new tax on million-dollar incomes; but Treasury Secretary Brady pointed out that wealthy people's share of the total tax burden already had gone up. So, of course, has their share of the total national income.
President Bush may have hit inadvertently upon a better idea than any of these advisers seem to have, though his Administration's policies do not reflect it. In the kind of symbolic action for which he is justly renowned -- proposing the flag-burning amendment at the Iwo Jima Monument, for instance -- Mr. Bush ventured out to J.C. Penney's and bought $28 worth of socks.
That sum will not put any of the more than eight million unemployed Americans back to work. But they and millions of others who used to be consumers either have no money to spend because they have no jobs, or are hoarding what money they do have because they fear they'll lose their jobs. So Mr. Bush's socks symbolize the need to stimulate consumer spending, hence the economy, by putting jobless people back to work.
That will cost money -- for public investment, for instance, in highways, bridges, sewage facilities, etc. Like a tax credit, public investment will take time to have effect. It may require breaking the budget agreement. But it will get help directly to those who most need it; and more people working will mean more people spending -- and not just for socks.

HEADLINE: Venezuela Is Expanding Its Role in Caribbean

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH

DATELINE: CARACAS, Venezuela

 BODY:
When Haiti's President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, was spirited to the airport after his overthrow by soldiers in September, the foreign jet awaiting to fly him into exile was not sent from Washington or Paris, traditionally the most influential of the Caribbean nation's foreign partners.
Instead, in a gesture that diplomats and political analysts say reflected his country's increased diplomatic presence in the region, it was Venezuela's President, Carlos Andres Perez, who sent his personal plane to carry Father Aristide to Caracas, where he has lived in exile since. 
 Experts on Caribbean affairs say Mr. Perez has deftly brought his country into the hemisphere's select circle of diplomatic powers by using its vast oil wealth and the yearning of many for a counterweight to the United States in a region composed of tiny islands.
Venezuela has more foreign embassies and cultural centers in the Caribbean than any other country. With few exceptions, each of the region's islands relies on arrangements, sponsored by Venezuela and Mexico, that help them finance vital oil imports.
The United States recently sent ripples through many of the Caribbean's thin economies by announcing its Enterprise for the Americas Initiative, an ambitious two-way free-trade program. Under the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which the new program will replace, the region's exporters had special access to the American market while giving up little in return.
Venezuela's response was to grant five years of duty-free entry for Caribbean products into its booming economy. The presumable payoff, many figured, would eventually be greatly increased access to the region for the country's rising industrial sector.
"The Caribbean risks becoming the most destabilizing factor in all of Latin America, because these countries can be subject to undesirable interests," Mr. Perez said in an interview at the presidential palace. "I am speaking about narco-traffickers, and all sorts of economic mafias that prey upon weak countries like these. Our policy is aimed at assuring the stability of the region, which will help assure its development."
Venezuelan commentators say healthy doses of self-interest as well as Mr. Perez's fondness for international diplomacy figure prominently in the country's aggressive foreign policy.
"Obviously commercial interests play a big part too," Andres Serbin, director of the Venezuelan Institute for Social and Political Studies, said of his country's growing interest in the Caribbean. "But there really is a great concern for the political stability of the region. Virtually all of our imports and oil exports pass through these waters."
In the case of Haiti, Mr. Perez invoked a historical debt, as well as what he said was a fear for democracy elsewhere in the hemisphere should a coup against an elected leader be allowed to stand.
"Simon Bolivar, our great liberator, received important aid from Haiti, and yet we in Latin America have done little to help this country, which is now the most backward in the hemisphere," Mr. Perez said, referring to two of the revolutionary's passages in exile through Haiti.
"After a history of abominable dictatorships, the first election that was authentically free gave us Jean-Bertrand Aristide," Mr. Perez said, speaking in Spanish. "If you were present, you saw the explosion of popular satisfaction when he took power, people running in the streets with joy. That was an experience that few of us can match."
"It is evident that President Aristide thought the use of the masses in the streets would enable him to reach his political objectives," he said, commenting on assertions that the Haitian had used crowds and the threat of violence to intimidate his opponents. "This was one of his errors. Direct democracy has not worked anywhere in the world."
"What is of crucial importance, though, is that we in Latin America cannot accept any more military coups," he added. "After all the dramas we have gone through, that would be fatal for our region."

HEADLINE: Mr. Quayle's Irregular Regulation

 BODY:
The Task Force on Regulatory Relief didn't amount to much when George Bush headed it as Vice President. But when Mr. Bush moved up, he renamed it and recharged its batteries. As the Council on Competitiveness, it has become a powerful force for watering down regulation -- and, not incidentally, for burnishing the image of its chairman, Vice President Quayle.
The council has drawn the justified fire of environmentalists, public-interest groups and Democrats in Congress for diluting proposed regulations. The council's defenders claim it has less power than the critics say, but there's no doubt Mr. Quayle has made it a friendly place for business to turn with complaints. 
 The council has been unnecessarily zealous in toning down the Environmental Protection Agency's plans for clean-air regulations. It wants to open up vital wetlands for development despite Mr. Bush's campaign pledge to protect them. Even its welcome move to speed Federal approval of new drugs has been challenged as too lenient.
The President has a legitimate interest in seeing that regulations don't exceed the law's authority, contradict his objectives and impose higher costs than they're worth. But the council's secrecy creates concern that businessmen are getting their way through the back door.
President Nixon began coordinated White House oversight in the 1970's, to get a handle on the flood of new regulation that flowed from the Johnson years. President Carter later institutionalized it in a Regulatory Analysis Review Group under the Council of Economic Advisers.
It remained a relatively benign procedure until President Reagan arrived and put the Office of Management and Budget in charge. He gave it the power to stall or block all regulations that didn't square with his anti-regulatory passion.
Frustrated Congressional Democrats, seeing their legislative intent subverted, have tried unsuccessfully to curb the O.M.B., or at least make its proceedings more public. Now they're targeting the competitiveness council too, mainly for secrecy and a pro-business slant. But they have also spotlighted the staff director's apparent conflict of interest as a stockholder in a utility holding company, and last week he agreed to put his holdings in a blind trust.
The council's structure belies its influence. Its members, six Cabinet officers, meet infrequently. Its staff numbers fewer than a dozen. But it can call on other Government agencies -- and outsiders -- for whatever help it needs.
The council is not shy about disclosing its achievements. However, its intrusions are not on the public record, where all concerned parties could keep track and chime in. The council claims executive privilege as an arm of the Presidency, but that's an all-too-common White House dodge for avoiding embarrassing disclosures.
When a President is formulating policy, he and his office have a right to confidentiality. But when they are rewriting regulations, the public has a right to know.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
A Grand Aid Gesture?

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Bush Administration officials say that the deteriorating situation in the former Soviet Union is filled with the most dangerous consequences. And yet, the help they offer to arrest those trends is most modest.
Bluntly, there is a galactic gap between the problems they say we face and what they are prepared to do about them. 
 Is this a lack of vision and political courage that will come back to haunt us? Or is it good sense?
Begin with one almost incomprehensible fact: The Russian empire, the Soviet Union, the center or whatever has vanished from the chessboard.
In its place is a commonwealth of independent republics. Its members, former Soviet republics, asserted control of military forces on their soil. But nobody knows if they have actual control. They say they have "united command" of some 27,000 nuclear weapons. But there is no central authority and therefore no common political control. They promise to build economic relations and use the ruble to settle accounts. But they have no mechanisms for doing so, and their economies are in a free fall.
Robert Gates, the Director of Central Intelligence, called this situation "the most significant civil disorder" since the 1917 Boslshevik revolution. He told Congress that "the situation is dangerously unstable." Secretary of State James Baker warned of resurgent Stalinism, fascism, extremist nationalism and militarism.
And how did Mr. Baker and President Bush propose to respond to such dire threats? First, they would spend the $400 million just voted by Congress -- with absolutely no help from the White House -- to begin dismantling nuclear weapons. Good. Second, they would spend $100 million just approved by Congress -- again with the White House standing by cravenly in silence -- to transport emergency humanitarian food and medical supplies. Good, again. Third, they would throw another $100 million into the pot to "catalyze private sector involvement," whatever that means. And fourth, they would convene an international conference next month to coordinate emergency relief aid this winter. Overdue, but in the right direction.
Is this a plausible recipe for heading off dictatorship and militarism in the former Soviet empire? Not likely, as Bush Administration officials privately admit.
But they say, and they are right, that the more relevant question is, would it work to do a lot more? Hardly anyone still advocates a massive Marshall Plan-style aid effort. Neither the Commonwealth nor the republics have the organization and stability to handle that. The money would simply disappear into bureaucratic pockets and foreign bank accounts. There is no "there" there to manage megabillion-dollar programs.
What about a smaller, multibillion-dollar effort to cushion against inflation and help pay for needed imports? Ambassador Robert Strauss publicly asked the White House to take that gamble last week. For fear of a few billion dollars going "up in smoke," he said, "we risk saying 10 years from now . . . $2 billion to $3 billion in this effort could . . . have prevented" fascism.
That's powerful rhetoric. But it is hard to see how a few billion, or even a few billion from many nations, would make a material difference in a sprawling trillion-dollar economy whose financial transactions currently rest on corruption and barter.
I once believed in a major aid effort based on Soviet performance to head off just the kind of chaos that impends. I could be persuaded to go somewhat in that direction again. But that depends on whether the Commonwealth and republics can get their acts together first. In any event, the topic should be on the agenda for the emergency conference next month.
None of these choices are happy ones. But for the time being and belatedly, Mr. Bush and company have zeroed in on the least wasteful, least impractical objectives: rounding up the nukes, staving off starvation in big cities and helping increase energy production.
Those goals are much smaller and less noble than preventing fascism and militarism. But they are also within our means and roughly attainable.
To attempt more would be to stage-manage an earthquake. It would be a grand gesture -- that would sap support for bold plans when the time might be right.

HEADLINE: About Cars;
Volvo Makes Its New 960 a Safe Bet

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:

DEAR SIR,
For a family vehicle, safety is paramount. Your review of the infant seats in the Chrysler vans did not mention whether the doors now have steel beams. If I were in the market for a family vehicle, the steel beams would be far more important than pull-down child seats. It's too bad the Government has not changed the safety standards to require those beams in the doors of minivans. -- NORMA M. BRAUDE, Fredonia, N.Y.
 
DEAR SIR,
I am a mom with four little kids, and I don't want to make ANY compromises on safety. I have been saving my money for four years now, planning to buy a minivan when they finally meet the safety standards for cars. But guess what -- my money is still sitting in the bank. 
 Built-in baby seats are great, but they don't address the fundamental problem that people have with minivans. You can always buy a great baby seat, but you can't go out and buy a crush-proof roof or interior-door supports for side collisions. -- ELLIE DUNHAM, West Chester, Pa.
AS those and other letters indicate, safety is on the minds of buyers and would-be buyers today. And Volvo, which was trying to push safety long before it was chic good business, now has at least a partial answer to side impacts with its all-new 960 model.
Granted, the 960 is not a minivan, but it is the flagship of the line and it can be had as a relatively large and boxy station wagon, as well as a sedan.
For 1992, the company's SIPS design takes direct aim at the concerns of those who would like a minivan but worry about accidents. The Swedish alphabet soup stands for "side impact protection system," and it is the feature of a current ad campaign whose target is the minivan.
According to the experts, side impacts are the second most common type of accidents, after frontal collisions. One of five accidents is said to involve a side impact, and while most of them occur at relatively low speeds, they produce more than their share of injuries.
Federal side-impact standards will go into effect in 1994, and while some vans -- notably Toyota's Previa -- already incorporate door beams, most do not. In defense, the other makers say that the different configuration of vans and the added height makes them inherently safer.
Part of the reason for the high injury rate in side impacts, of course, is that there is little distance between the passenger and the vehicle that is T-boning the car. Only the doors and the B-pillar (the post between the windows) stand between the impact and your frail self.
Volvo's spokesmen say that years of study went into designing the new system and that the engineers finally came up with a method that spreads the accident forces over a larger portion of the vehicle's structure as it reduces intrusion into the passenger compartment.
The design, used in the company's 7-series cars as well as in the new 960, is the result of mathematical models as well as other tests, and it strengthens the B-pillars and floor members while reinforcing the door sills and roof rails. The engineering allows crash forces to be dissipated throughout the body and redirected around the "safety cage" that houses occupants. Projections from test results indicate a 25 percent reduction in fatalities or serious injuries in SIPS vehicles.
None of the new toughness shows, of course, because this is Volvo we're talking about. In fact, you might be hard pressed to notice anything special at all about the 960. Volvo is like that.
But the car is a delight. In my case, it was a dark aqua (officially called blue-green in a winning case of corporate candor) four-door wagon that shared the somewhat fluid lines of last year's new 940. The wagon sticks to what it does best, though, and its 74.9 cubic feet of cargo capacity make it a natural for any family that wants a luxury hauler.
That luxury includes a leather interior, tan in the case of the tester but also available in black or gray, full power equipment, a sunroof that either slides fully open or serves as a vent with a flip-up panel, and such niceties as a three-position memory for the driver's seat. In fact, the only option is a compact-disk player at $795.
You can add that figure to a base of $34,655, plus about $500 for preparation, and that means that this car is no cheap thrill. But given the competition and unless your ego demands turned heads, it may well be worth the ticket.
The heated front buckets are well designed and add to the general comfort of the car, while the rear bench offers more legroom than you see in far larger vehicles. A fat four-spoked steering wheel, wrapped in black leather, holds an air bag in its center. Unlike many cars, though, that doesn't mean tiny and hard-to-find horn buttons; for safety, the entire hub serves as a horn.
There is a black dash, whose analog instruments are dominated by a tachometer and large 140-m.p.h. speedometer, and the controls are easy to use. Much of what you get in the new 960 goes beyond creature comforts, however. It is beneath the skin in the form of an all-new aluminum engine and a new four-speed electronically controlled automatic transmission.
The engine, an inline six that is just four inches longer than a Volvo four-banger, uses 24 valves and dispenses with the conventional distributor, replacing it with individual ignition coils that sit atop each of the spark plugs. The powerplant displaces only 2.9 liters, but it puts out 201 horses, healthy delivery in a vehicle whose weight is about 3,400.
The power is delivered to the rear wheels through the automatic, which has three selectable modes: economy, sport and winter. In the economy mode, upshifts are gentle and are executed at relatively low engine speeds. A push of the sport button allows higher revs before shifting, and the winter setting locks out first and second gear to prevent wheel spin on slippery roads.
Another feature is the "down-slope mode," in which the transmission senses when the vehicle is descending a hill and automatically engages a lower gear to provide engine braking. Actual stopping power is provided by the standard antilock brakes.
On the road, the car is a joy: steady, stable and solid. And, again, while it is no minivan, Volvo's new wagon just might be the answer to a family's prayer.

HEADLINE: New G.M. Leadership Flails for Ways to Halt the Car Maker's Slide

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

DATELINE: DETROIT

 BODY:
Robert C. Stempel became the General Motors Corporation's 11th chairman in August 1990, amid widespread hope that "Team Stempel" could turn the nation's largest company around. As an engineer, in contrast with the series of accountants who preceded him, Mr. Stempel seemed well positioned to overhaul G.M.'s car and truck models to compete against the Japanese. And his collegial and attentive style was expected to inspire initiative and free expression among the troops, loosening up the authoritarian culture that had prevailed when Roger B. Smith was chairman.
But 15 months later, there is little evidence that his leadership has unraveled G.M.'s most confounding predicaments. The company's customer base in North America has failed to grow from depressed levels despite huge investments in new models, losses have mounted, and credit analysts have threatened to downgrade its debt rating -- a prospect that could severely undermine its ability to finance purchases by buyers and dealers. 
 Now, under escalating financial pressure, Mr. Stempel has fallen back on the same strategy for coping with problems as the one preferred by his much-criticized predecessor. Last week, Mr. Stempel announced deep cutbacks that will probably include plant closings, layoffs and the second charge against earnings in 18 months. Although some details of the plan will be announced Wednesday, and others later, the moves are designed to close the widening gap between G.M.'s production capacity and its sales.
But unlike past revampings, this round may reshuffle G.M.'s top brass -- Mr. Stempel and the five G.M. executives who also serve as directors. According to two associates of G.M. board members, the company's nonemployee directors have asked Mr. Stempel to evaluate his top-management team with an eye toward change -- a powerful departure from custom.
Like many old-line industrial concerns, G.M. has a deep-seated cultural aversion for holding managers and executives accountable when they perform poorly. Mr. Smith, for instance, was retained as chairman for years after people both inside and outside of G.M. had concluded that he was ineffective. Analysts agree that a reshuffling would be a heartening signal to workers that top management was finally taking responsible for G.M.'s poor performance.
"This is the third restructuring charge in three years -- a lot of changes and G.M. is still losing money," said Jack V. Kirnan, automotive analyst for Kidder, Peabody in New York. "Changing top G.M. executives will instill in the younger G.M. executives the idea that you are rewarded for excellence, not mediocrity."
Analysts believe any reshuffling of top management is likely to affect Lloyd E. Reuss, G.M.'s 55-year-old president. Mr. Reuss is directly responsible for North American operations, the source of most of G.M.'s problems, and had been in charge of all or most of North America for four years before becoming president. This year, analysts say, Mr. Reuss's operations will lose up to $8 billion, an increase over last year's $4.5 billion loss.
Mr. Reuss was not the board's first choice as president. When Mr. Stempel first took office, nonemployee directors had preferred John F. Smith Jr., 53, the respected head of G.M.'s international operations who became popular with Wall Street after a successful tour of duty in Europe. When Mr. Stempel insisted on Mr. Reuss, the board acquiesced, but declined to give Mr. Reuss the additional title of chief operating officer, which would have formalized his status as Mr. Stempel's No. 2 man.
A G.M. spokesman, responding to widespread speculation on Wall Street and within the company that Mr. Reuss might be replaced as president, said no management changes will be announced until Wednesday.

FOR Mr. Stempel, the cutbacks are a bruising reminder of his promise when he took over to have G.M. operating at full capacity by next year. As recently as this summer, he had been predicting that the crop of 1992 models would be the crowning glory of a long-awaited turnaround in G.M.'s share of the North American market.
While executives admit that the company neglected new-model development and quality in the early 1980's in favor of building new factories, G.M. has made up for it since then. In the last five years, it has invested roughly $7 billion annually, mostly to revamp car and truck models. The culmination of that program came this fall, when G.M. divisions introduced nine new car and six new truck models -- the most ever by an auto maker during one 12-month period.
From the compact Saturn to the glitzy Cadillac Seville, the new offerings are higher in quality and in technology and more aggressively priced than previous new models, earning high marks and even some raves from reviewers.
But their retail sales haven't been high enough to cover the enormous cost of operating 32 North American assembly lines and associated parts plants. The North American operation has been losing an estimated $500 million a month, according to some analysts.
Some of the blame can be tagged on the recession. The entire market for new vehicles in this country shrank to a four-year low of about 12.7 million in 1991, down from 16 million in the mid-1980's. Consumer confidence is low, consumer debt is high and the Big Three have been far less aggressive in subsidizing fleet sales to daily rental companies than they have in the past.
"If the economy had been recovering, Stempel might have been able to follow his original plan and make piecemeal improvements without any big write-offs," said a financial analyst who insisted on anonymity because of Securities and Exchange Commission restrictions in connection with his brokerage's underwriting of G.M.'s $1.5 billion preference stock offering. The offering, set to close this week, is designed to fortify G.M.'s diminished equity base.
But G.M.'s problems also stem from the new models' failure to win back many buyers who defected to competing brands. Through November, G.M.'s share of the North American market was 35.1 percent, down from 35.7 percent last year and 40 percent in the early 80's.
Leon Mandel, publisher of Auto Week, says it's too early to make final judgments about the new models. "No one is making money, not even the Japanese," he said. "So it's not surprising that the biggest auto maker is losing the most money."
Yet G.M.'s Chevrolet division has had almost 400,000 fewer sales this year than last. The full-sized Caprice sedan, which was new in 1990, took a steep dive after its first year. The Buick Park Avenue near-luxury sedan, quite popular when it was introduced last year, has also begun to lose sales, in part because Buick is offering financing discounts to introduce its slightly smaller but similarly powered Buick LeSabre. Considering the value of 2.9 percent financing, the LeSabre sells for roughly $10,000 less than the $25,285 Park Avenue, yet looks virtually the same.
Could it be that today's car buyers haven't recognized the change in G.M.? "Perceptions lag reality," said James Fitzpatrick, G.M.'s vice president of marketing and public affairs. Mr. Fitzpatrick said top G.M. executives are convinced their vehicles are precisely what the public needs and wants. Advertising has stressed improvements in quality, safety and other equipment features, as opposed to "image" advertising showing portraits of happy customers exclaiming over their vehicles.
Many marketing experts believe G.M. confuses customers with too many brands and too many models in overlapping market segments. Stylists have differentiated models from various G.M. divisions so they don't look as much alike as they once did. The Chevy Lumina, for example, doesn't look as similar to the Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme as it did six years ago.
But now there is a new problem: quite a few models sold by the same division are the same size and appeal to roughly the same group of buyers. That's the problem with the Buick LeSabre and the Park Avenue.

JUDGING from readers' letters to automotive magazines, many former G.M. owners still hold grudges about bad experiences they had with G.M. cars they once owned. Many switched to competing brands and aren't interested in switching back. It is a problem, in fact, for all domestic makers, who have lost a whole generation of buyers to Japanese vehicles.
Until some of these buyers return, even an economic recovery might not be enough to bring G.M.'s huge fixed costs in line with revenues, making plant closings inevitable. Excess capacity has grown since 1986, reaching 50 percent of production this year. G.M. has tried to increase capacity use and reduce fixed costs without shutting entire plants by cutting assembly lines and making the ones left more flexible and efficient.
Plant closings almost certainly would stir rancor from G.M.'s 300,000 hourly workers. The current labor contract precludes closings, but G.M. has used contract loopholes before to shut plants. The union understands that the auto maker can't build cars for which there are no customers.
Yet the union has resented having to bear so much of the burden for G.M.'s poor performance, as it did in the 80's, while executives sacrificed little. G.M. has tried to mend relations with workers to improve quality on the line, arguing that higher productivity is the only true form of job security. Overall quality at G.M., as measured by independent testers like J. D. Power & Associates, has improved, but it still lags behind the Japanese.
The Big Three virtually guaranteed up to 85 percent of wages for all United States auto workers, regardless of whether they are working. G.M. alone committed up to $3.35 billion to cover jobless benefits and has spent $1.2 billion of that amount. Referring to hourly jobless benefits, John Maciarz, a G.M. spokesman on labor issues, said "we don't have an endless supply of income."
Mr. Stempel may ask the union to reopen the labor agreement and discuss trimming those benefits. But, union officials say, without a signal that top management also is willing to take responsibility for G.M.'s ailments, Mr. Stempel is likely to get a chilly reception.

 
 
THE RAVAGING POTENTIAL OF A DOWNGRADE
 In announcing cutbacks last week, the General Motors Corporation's most immediate concern was to reassure credit analysts that it was serious about shoring up its weakening balance sheet. In early November, agencies that evaluate G.M. bonds and commercial paper warned of a possible downgrading of the company's debt ratings.
Such a downgrading could be devastating to G.M. Its General Motors Acceptance Corporation finance arm is the second-largest user of the commercial credit market after G.E. Credit. It has used its highest credit rating to raise money cheaply to lend it to finance consumer purchases of cars and trucks, fleet sales and dealer inventories at a healthy profit. Over the last seven years, G.M.A.C. has netted $1 billion or more.
A downgrading could squeeze G.M. out of the top-rated commercial paper market, forcing the auto maker to use more expensive borrowing for consumer financing. Earlier this year, Chrysler was forced out of that market because of its poor debt ratings. Where Chrysler will find money for financing next year is a large question.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: The Spitzer Outlook;
On Alert for Sites As the Cycles Turn

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
THE developer-owner who finds himself without a site that he is currently developing might well bristle at the idea that he is inactive. He is out there looking. He is also tending to the property he already owns.
So it is with Bernard Spitzer, a 67-year-old builder and investment-owner, a civil engineer with a taste for esthetics and design, a reputation as an insightful taskmaster and a preference for residential buildings in prime Manhattan locations. If there is an unusual construction challenge, so much the better. 
 In almost 40 years of building in New York City he calculates that he has been without a site under development only 15 percent of the time. This is such a time, although he is actively considering buying any of three.
The direction of his current activities illuminate the near-term course of most Manhattan investment-builders. They are unlikely to start major new residential projects soon and they are tending to improvements on their own property at a time when competition for tenants is strong.
But, as Dennis Brady, vice president of Jack Resnick & Sons, put it, "Our interest never wavers. We are always out there looking."
What they are finding, in many cases, are uncompleted construction projects that can be purchased at favorable prices and completed. With an excessive supply of new housing built at development costs that are no longer justified by market prices, New York City is in a period of workouts that may shut the door on new unassisted development until the mid-90's, many builders say.
"One doesn't think of new sites these days," said Henry Elghanayan, a principal in Rockrose Development Corporation. "The thought is that there are problem projects out there that can be bought at reduced prices and turned around."
On the commercial side, Mr. Spitzer is involved with just such a property. With two partners, Marvin Winter and Jerome L. Greene, he bought the Crown Building, at 730 Fifth Avenue and 57th Street, at a foreclosure auction last February for $93.6 million. The 300,000-square-foot building was 50 percent vacant. The lobby and other public spaces have been improved and about 10 percent of the vacant space has been leased.
But in most of his career Mr. Spitzer has concentrated on residential buildings, often with garage and commercial space as well. He has built about 2,000 apartments as rentals, co-ops and condominiums, and he still retains what he describes as a "substantial" number of them.
A vacancy typically means an improvement costing $25,000 to $150,000, depending on how long the apartment was occupied. At 200 Central Park South he has spent $100,000 this fall to improve an apartment that had been occupied for 20 years. It is on the market for $6,000 a month.
In the same building he has already rented out for $6,250 a month a 1,600-square-foot apartment that was rebuilt at a cost of $200,000. It has three exposures from the 27th floor.
It makes no difference from the owner-developer's standpoint whether the apartment is within a co-op, condominium or rental structure. The vacancy, in these prime locations, leads to a major improvement to justify the maximum rent the market will accept. Public spaces in the rental buildings also are redone.
MR. SPITZER'S construction career began in 1952 when he was 28 years old. He was a field supervisor for the late Sam Minskoff, founder of the Minskoff Brothers building firm, when he decided that the future lay in building for his own account.
So he bought land in Riverdale and produced the 88-unit building at 3640 Johnson Avenue. Then came the 21-story 112-unit apartment house at 3131 Grand Concourse, completed in 1958. Both were subsequently sold to raise money for further activities.
In Manhattan since then he has built three times on Fifth Avenue (No. 1050, an 88-unit co-op at 86th Street; No. 985, a 48-unit rental between 79th and 80th Streets, and No. 800, a 208-unit rental at 61st Street); twice on Central Park South (No. 200, a 312-unit rental, and No. 210, a 90-unit rental, both subsequently converted to co-ops) and once each on Park Avenue (No. 1020, at 85th Street, since converted to a co-op), and East 72d Street (No. 220, near Third Avenue).
The residential portion of the 72d Street building, with 147 rental apartments, is above six floors occupied by Marymount Manhattan College. In some of these projects, Mr. Winter and Mr. Greene were partners.
Mr. Spitzer also built the Corinthian, his most recent project, and one of exceptional scale for a Manhattan residential building. It has 865 apartments on 54 residential floors, plus about 90,000 square feet of offices and a 150-car garage. It is on the site of the former East Side Airlines Terminal on First Avenue between 37th and 38th Streets.
Mr. Spitzer has a particular taste for complicated construction challenges, but they are overcome in his view only if they achieve an economically sound project as well.
The Corinthian was a notable challenge. He bought the 81,000-square-foot site at a Metropolitan Transportation Authority auction in 1985 for $90.6 million. "The building could have been overpowering and perhaps monstrous esthetically," he says.
Instead he settled on a tower that has a long curving central corridor from which 17 lines of apartments jut out, ending in living rooms with long circular windows and extensive views. The architect for this and other projects was the firm of Michael Schimenti of Valley Stream, L.I., now run by the late Mr. Schimenti's son, John. The design architect of record on the project, Der Scutt said of Mr. Spitzer: "He was the most organized and demanding developer I ever worked for. He holds the line on budget and schedule and at the same time demands good design."
THE builder himself, who made numerous design changes personally, says he fell "madly in love" with the Corinthian and hoped at first to keep it as a rental. But the condominium market was peppy at the time, and a rental would have been a heavier risk for the builder and his partners and probably more difficult to finance. As a condominium, about 75 percent of the apartments were sold at an average price of about $350 a square foot over a year and half, Mr. Spitzer said. The remaining apartments are still owned by the partnership or its individual members, with some being rented.
Another design challenge involved the site on the west side of Seventh Avenue at Central Park South, which became 200 Central Park South. Mr. Spitzer admired the location from a taxicab window in the early 60's, and set out to find how it could be assembled. The key property was a 12-story building on 28,000 square feet owned by the Shubert Organization. It and neighboring properties were duly purchased.
The distinctive curving shape facing northeast at the intersection was sketched out on a three-by-five card at a kitchen table by the builder.
According to Mr. Spitzer, about one development plan out of 50 ever reaches fruition. One notable recent failure explains why he is without a buildable site at present.
He bought three small properties on the south side of 57th Street near Lexington Avenue, occupying 7,500 square feet of land, in the mid-80's in hope of purchasing the neighboring 8,000-square-foot site where the Transit Authority operates a substation.
The idea was to interest the authority in improving its operation largely at developer expense, in exchange for providing development rights for a new 175,000-square-foot building above. The substation's generators would be temporarily relocated during construction and ultimately replaced by new equipment.
The Transit Authority was agreeable, but when it auctioned the site with the conditions that the winning bidder had to meet, Mr. Spitzer was outbid by the property owner to the east, Dr. Axel Stawski. The winning bid was $6.125 million.
So Mr. Spitzer will forgo the responsibility of sinking columns for a new skyscraper through an operating substation without decommissioning the East Side subway system. That challenge is Dr. Stawski's. Mr. Spitzer is ready for another.

HEADLINE: Economic Pulse: New England/A special report.;
New England's Siren Call of 80's Becomes Echo of the Depression

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NASHUA, N.H., Dec. 12

 BODY:
It seemed like the American dream to Barbara Cleland when she moved here from Massachusetts eight years ago to open a private educational testing and tutorial service. Nashua was the fastest growing town in the fastest growing state east of the Mississippi River, after Florida, and soon, with a bank loan against her house, the former teacher had two busy offices with 25 employees.
 But now, with New Hampshire's economy in a shambles, Miss Cleland's students have defaulted on their tuition. She herself had to declare bankruptcy and has lost her business, her house, her savings and her car. 
Miss Cleland, a 45-year-old divorced mother, may even have to skip Christmas. "My daughter and I decided we would only buy each other a book, but we can't afford it," she said.
 
Worst Since 1930's
 Miss Cleland's plight is only one example of the hardships forced on the six New England states over the past two years, as the region's economic slump has turned into by far the worst for this area since the Great Depression in the 1930's. According to economists, it may prove to be the worst recession since the 1930's for any region in the country by the time it ends.
 Already New Hampshire has lost 10.7 percent of its jobs since 1989, said Andrew Sum, the director of the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University in Boston. He said Massachusetts has lost even more, 11.1 percent of its jobs in that time.
 The only state to suffer heavier job losses since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began to collect data in 1939 was Michigan during a somewhat longer period, from 1979 to 1982, Mr. Sum said. Michigan lost 12.2 percent of its jobs in those three years.
 But what makes the situation seem even worse in New England is, unlike Michigan where four out of five jobs lost were in manufacturing, here they have been shed across the board, in every sector but health care, said Sara Johnson, a regional economist with DRI/McGraw Hill, an economic consulting company. Construction, computers, banking, retail trade and local government all have lost workers, many of them well paid white-collar employees largely untouched by the nation's last recession in 1981-82.
 
Spotlight on Region
 The severity of New England's suffering will be in the national spotlight soon, with candidates and journalists trudging through the snow for New Hampshire's Presidential primary in February. A recent Boston Globe poll of 880 voters in that conservative state found that 74 percent disapproved of President Bush's handling of the economy. In a hypothetical election between Mr. Bush and his unknown Democratic opponent, the President barely prevailed, 35 percent to 31 percent. The poll's margin of sampling error was plus or minus five percentage points.
 People in New Hampshire are so angry and frustrated that the state has experienced its first large exodus since just after the Civil War. According to the New Hampshire Office of State Planning, 5,000 people left between mid-1989 and April 1990.
 And the economic projections say things will get bleaker in New England before they get better. "Our forecast for New England is that employment will decline for the first three months of 1992, and then begin a slow recovery by spring," Ms. Johnson said.
 Even this recovery depends on a national recovery first, the specialists say, a shaky proposition at present. "Without the engine of the national recovery, there is not going to be any train," said Frederick Breimyer, the president of the New England Economic Project, a forecasting group.
 In fact, the long run prognosis for the six states of New England -- including Maine, Vermont, Rhode Island and Connecticut besides New Hampshire and Massachusetts -- is that they will not recover their peak level of employment until the year 2000, Mr. Breimyer said.
 
Problems of 80's Remain
 The reason for this pessimism is that the problems that ended New England's boom of the 1980's, when it enjoyed the greatest improvement in living standards of any region of the country, have not been overcome.
 These include some of the nation's highest wages and housing prices, which, although they have declined somewhat with the recession, remain generally high and make New England unattractive to business investment. They also involve trouble in the region's primary industries, with cutbacks in military spending and a shift in the computer business away from minicomputers, which had been the mainstay of high-tech industry in Massachusetts and New Hampshire. Minicomputers, middle range machines that displaced mainframes in the late 60's and 70's, have since been overcome by smaller desktop and personal computers.
 The effects of the recession have been compounded by crises in each of the state's budgets, as governors and legislators have wrangled over increases in taxes and cuts in services. The proposed solutions have varied from state to state, but all six have endured some paralysis in state government and widesrepad public anger.
 For New Englanders, the recession's effects have been magnified because, having led the rest of the nation into the recession, they have been mired in it much longer. More and more of the unemployed here are becoming long-term unemployed, with all the stress that brings, said Mr. Sum of Northeastern.
 At present, 42 percent of all the unemployed in New England have been out of work for more than 15 weeks, Mr. Sum said. And 25 percent of the unemployed in the region have not had jobs for 26 weeks, meaning that they have exhausted their unemployment benefits, at least until a new law passed by Congress last month extending these benefits kicks in.
 "The problem is, a lot of these individuals are exhausted, they've used everything up," he said.
 One indication of this has been a calamitous surge in the number of bankruptcies, like that filed by Miss Cleland in Nashua. New Hampshire led the country with the largest increase in personal and business bankruptcy filings between 1989 and 1990, jumping 94 percent, to 2,568 from 1,324, according to court records. Indeed, the six New England states were the six highest in the nation in that category.
 Similar financial pressures have triggered a stunning increase in the number of welfare caseloads in the six New England states, led by a whopping 160 percent rise in cases in New Hampshire of Aid to Families With Dependent Children between October 1988 and October 1991, according to state figures.
 Paradoxically, Miss Cleland found that she is ineligible for welfare because her daughter just turned 18, and ineligible for unemployment compensation because she had been self-employed -- even though she had regularly paid taxes for all employees, including herself, into the state's unemployment fund. She has appealed the latter decision.
 In the meantime, Miss Cleland has taken a job teaching in a private day-care center. She is making $6 an hour, or $12,000 a year, with no benefits. When she graduated from college 20 years ago, her starting salary as a grade school teacher was $14,000.
 
Declining Services

 Schools Struggle In Massachusetts
The pain and ravages caused by the recession can be found everywhere in these small old states.
 At the Peck Middle School in Holyoke, an aged industrial city in western Massachusetts, the number of teachers was cut in half this fall. There is no more physical education, no shop, no home economics, no foreign languages and no guidance counselors. The computer room, with 50 new machines, is simply locked up.
 The Holyoke School Department, ordered by a deficit-plagued city to cut its budget, also reduced the number of school buses for the Peck School in half, so more students must walk to class. Attendance is down, grades are slipping and the number of disciplinary suspensions is up.
 "I think there is a promise that has been broken, to do for kids today what our parents provided for us," said George Counter, Holyoke's school superintendent. Overall, Mr. Counter had to lay off 220 teachers this fall, or 36 percent of his entire teaching staff in this city of 44,000 people.
 Efrain Santos has 40 students in his fourth-grade bilingual class at the Lawrence Elementary School. Last year he had 22. By state law bilingual classes may not exceed a maximum of 18 pupils; a group of Hispanic parents is suing the city on that point. Meanwhile, 7 of the 24 classrooms in the school are empty for lack of teachers.
 Mr. Santos, a native of Puerto Rico, like most of his students, has six levels of reading groups in his jammed class, but he cannot get to each everyday. "Some of the kids are not learning as fast as they did before," he observed. "I often blame myself."
 One of his fellow teachers, Noreen Kane, who was born and raised in Holyoke and has taught in the city's public schools for 19 years, decided to put her own two sons in private school this fall. "I am embarrassed for my city, but I had to do it for their sake," she said.
 Holyoke's school crisis has been brought about by a combination of cuts in Massachusetts state aid for local education, the city's shifting of the schools' utility and maintenance bills onto the School Department and voters' repeated rejection of tax increases for education.
 In November Holyoke's voters approved higher taxes to maintain city trash collection but again turned down more money for the schools. Opposition to school spending is widespread in Massachusetts, part of general outrage against higher taxes, but it has been worsened in Holyoke by the large proportion of elderly voters there and a backlash against Puerto Ricans whose children make up two-thirds of the public-school students.
 At the Peck Middle School, Kate Sandoval, a seventh grader with braces, misses gym, music, art and cooking classes. "It seems like we're just staying in one classroom all day now," she said.
 She blames "the older people in Holyoke who got their education when they were young."
 "It's unfair," said the 12 year-old. "How will we get jobs?"
 With unemployment in Holyoke running at 13 percent, voters last spring also rejected a proposal to continue financing the city's public library. So to try to keep the library open at least a few hours a week, the institution's board of directors last month auctioned of most of its collection of paintings that had been donated in flusher times by wealthy mill owners. That brought in more than $600,000.
 But to Roland Pineault, a local art dealer, the auction was an insult. "It was just another nail in the coffin of the deterioration of the city," he said. "They are giving away our heritage."
 
Shrinking Economies

 In 4 States, Less To Go Around
 New Hampshire and Massachusetts have had the sharpest downturn, but the region's other four states have all suffered. Even largely rural Vermont has experienced a 42.5 rise in welfare cases since 1988. Vermont's construction industry has collapsed, as the market for vacation homes has vanished, and many workers have been laid off in the high-tech companies around Burlington.
 Some Vermonters blame the economic hard times for a jump in the state's murder rate, which has reached 22 this year, tying the record for homicides, set in 1978.
 "I'm sure that people are under more stress because of the recession," said Tom Slayton, the editor of Vermont Life, a magazine that trumpets the virtues of the Green Mountain state. "Basically a lot of people buy the pastoral myth of Vermont, that Vermont is somehow apart from the rest of urban America," Mr. Slayton said.
 "It's a good myth, it's a myth that true," he said.
 "This is a state where people literally don't lock their doors," Mr. Slayton added. "But this concentration of murders has brought people up short. More people are locking their doors than they did before."
 In Maine and Connecticut the contracting economy has meant sharply lower tax revenues and has produced angry clashes over the states' budgets.
 Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut announced recently that less than three months after the largest tax increase in state history and the introduction of an income tax, Connecticut's budget was already headed for another deficit. Despite this, the Legislature convened a special session and, on Friday, voted to repeal the new tax law. Governor Weicker, an independent, promptly vetoed that repeal and the House failed to override his veto.
 The lengthy dispute over tax increases has made business leaders even more uncertain and has aggravated the recession, said Nicholas Perna, the chief economist for the Shawmut National Corporation, the large bank, in Hartford. "For all intents and purposes, Connecticut doesn't have a budget," he said. "Forget about what you think of the income tax. The issue is, businesses can't plan."
 In Maine, Gov. John R. McKernan, a Republican, invoked his emergency powers last month to cut state spending by $22.5 million through December, with the biggest reduction coming in state aid to schools. In July, Mr. McKernan shut down the state government for a week when he could not reach agreement with the Legislature on a budget.
 In Rhode Island, the effects of the recession have been worsened by a banking crisis touched off when Gov. Bruce Sundlun, a Democrat, shut down 45 banks and credit unions in January after the failure of the state's private insurance fund, the Rhode Island Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation. The fund crumbled after bailing out the Heritage Loan and Investment Company.
 Governor Sundlun has since reopened 32 of the 45 institutions. But out of the original $1.7 billion in frozen assets, more than $1 billion remains in limbo and may take years for depositors to recover, if at all.
 For Connie and Daniel Thornton, of Warwick, who had deposited more than $100,000 from the sale of their house in the Rhode Island Central Credit Union, the crisis has meant having to postpone retirement and cut back on virtually all expenses. "At this point in our lives, we were looking forward to enjoying a little more," said Mrs. Thornton, a controller in a law firm.
 "It's like they stole a year of our life from us," Mrs. Thornton said. "We eat at home. We don't go out that often. We can't travel."
 The Thorntons had bought a new home for retirement, but without access to their money they are having trouble meeting the mortgage payments. "I don't know how long we can afford to stay here," said Mrs. Thornton, who joins other pickets every day at lunchtime in front of the closed credit union.
 "It is our money, we shouldn't have to beg for it," she said. "I'm never going to trust another politician again."
 
Disappearing Jobs

 Growth Industries Decline From 80's
 In Nashua, a city of 79,000 on the Massachusetts border, the high-tech and military industry companies that fueled its growth in the 1980's have been laying off workers by the thousands. Robert Tamposi, the director of the city's understaffed welfare office, said applications for emergency relief had jumped 72 percent between 1989 and 1990, to 6,000 families.
 Many of them were well-educated, affluent people like engineers, marketing representatives or managers who have never been laid off before, he said. Some are assigned by the local general relief office to menial tasks like sweeping leaves in exchange for help.
 At the Nashua Soup Kitchen and Shelter, Lisa Christie, the director, said she had given out 1,679 food baskets so far this year, each with a three-day supply of groceries. That is up 200 percent from last year, she said.
 "Middle-class people are coming in who would never have dreamed they would come to a soup kitchen," she said. "They still own a home, but can't afford food."
 Carl Swenson, the director of the Nashua Pastoral Care Center, said people were stunned by the speed with which their lives are unraveling. "It's incredible how fast you can do down," he said. "Up here there's no public transportation, so when the bank comes in and repos the car, you can't get to work anymore."
 "We estimate that, in a middle-class family with both partners working, after the first job goes, within 90 days, the family is losing their house and vehicle and looking for food," Mr. Swenson said.
Greg Staradub, a 50-year-old systems engineer, was laid off after 26 years at Lockheed Sanders, a major military electronics manufacturer. Mr. Staradub, a graduate of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, looks with sadness on the strip of fake colonial shopping malls and car dealerships that sprung up during the boom of the 1980's around Nashua, replacing the pastoral country roads that originally attracted him here.
 "The trees and the woods are gone, and now those buildings are empty," he said. "In a sense, they chopped it all down for nothing."

HEADLINE: Helping Employees At Small Businesses

BYLINE: By PENNY SINGER

 BODY:
WITH the recession still going strong and companies putting renewed emphasis on increasing efficiency, executives are looking for ways to help their employees address personal problems that produce stress, which can reduce their performance.
Many large corporations have expanded employee assistance programs, confidential intervention and consultation systems for workers and their families. A good program provides assessments, brief counseling and referrals for problems of substance abuse, work stress, family relationships and personal problems. 
 Because the small companies that employ a majority of American workers can seldom afford their own in-house programs, they depend on help from outside concerns like Longview Associates, a nonprofit firm in White Plains.
"Employee assistance programs provide access to professional counselors who meet with employees on the outside," said T. J. Elliott, a vice president of Longview. "We also help write company policy manuals, set up procedures and train managers and supervisors to become sensitive to employees' problems and tactful when dealing with them."
 
Finding Outside Help
 The assistance can produce results for small employers. "In a company as small as mine, you don't have a human resource director, you don't even have a personnel office; you try to deal with employees and their problems all by yourself," said Joan Corwin, president of Chappaqua Transportation Company, a school bus company that employs 110 people.
In 1989, Ms. Corwin said, "when the law decreed that we had to have a drug-testing program because we were in the transportation business, I didn't even know what an employee assistance program was, and I was not anxious to spend money for one. But because I needed help with setting up a drug-testing program in the company, I was put in touch with Longview Associates."
"Not only did they write a policy and help us implement it," she said, "but they helped me deal with our drivers, who were sort of apprehensive about the whole thing."
 
'An Additional Benefit'
 Mr. Elliott, Ms. Corwin said, "came up here and gave talks to the drivers in our office, explaining the process, and walked the shop steward and myself through the whole procedure."
The drivers now like the program, Mrs. Corwin added. "They see it as an additional benefit and one that can help them with personal problems on the home front," she said. "With the recession, there's an awful lot of stress around. Even in a business like mine, which is pretty stable -- kids go to school in good times and bad -- a lot of our employees have difficult personal problems."
When employees with problems are referred to Longview, Mr. Elliott said, "the first thing the counselor will do is give them a chance to ventilate, to air their grievances."
"We'll go back and get a more accurate picture of the problem. Troubled employees meet with a counselor for three sessions. But when more help is needed, as is sometimes the case with drug or alcohol abuse, referral to a long-term treatment center is arranged by us."
During the current recession, the number of calls for help for stress-related problems has risen sharply, he said. "Although drug and gambling addiction problems have flattened out, there are more people with serious financial worries brought on by salary cuts or such things as the loss of a spouse's income," Mr. Elliott said. "And we find more people are abusing alcohol, the legal drug, and each other. For instance, cases of domestic violence against women, who are being abused physically and verbally, have soared during the past two years."
 
Low Fees for Many
 Longview Associates was originally organized as a department of the National Council of Alcoholism and Drug Abuse in White Plains. The department split off and became a freestanding designer of employee assistance programs in 1975.
"As a not-for-profit organization, we continue to serve over 50 percent of our clients at cost," Mr. Elliott said, "and that includes about two-thirds of all schools in Westchester, hospitals and colleges."
Mr. Elliott, who is an accredited certified counselor in New York State, formerly ran the employee assistance program for 50,000 employees of American Airlines on the East Coast. He said that while large companies have the resources for in-house employee assistance programs that are staffed by full-time counselors, the majority of Americans, who work for small companies, don't have access to such services even though they may often have the most need for them.
"We have designed and implemented affordable programs for small companies that cost anywhere from $20 to $24 per employee a year," Mr. Elliott said. "Good employee assistance programs make a big difference to a company. For example, a single case of an employee suffering from a nervous breakdown can wreak havoc with a small company's medical coverage. A good employee assistance program should be able to find the best treatment for the employee without raising the company's medical coverage costs."
 
Potential Savings
 On July 26, 1992, Mr. Elliott said, the Americans With Disabilities Act becomes law. "It will change American business because employers will have to be concerned with whether they are reasonably accommodating workers with alcohol, drug or addictive problems," he said. "Now, recovering alcoholics are often turned down for a job because of their past history."
In the short term, he said, the new law may be viewed as a real squeeze, during a recession, on businesses that have to pay for a safeguard to deal with troubled employees. "But I would hope companies would consider installing employee assistance programs to help them deal with the new law," Mr. Elliott said, "because in the long term they will more than pay for themselves in increased productivity and a smoother work-place operation."
At Curtis Instruments in Mount Kisco, Ann Papaelias, vice president of human resources, said more Curtis employees were taking advantage of the company's employee assistance program.
"I think the value of the program is that it catches problems before they really get bad," Ms. Papaelias said. "Our employees are either referred to Longview counselors by their supervisors or they go for help on their own. But every case is treated in strictest confidence. Other employees are not aware when an employee goes to seek help because appointments with counselors are held off-site."
 
More Clients This Year
 And even though business is stable at Curtis, a manufacturer of instruments and controls for electric vehicles like fork- lift trucks and golf carts, Ms. Papaelias said employees are exhibiting signs of stress, which leads to serious problems.
"Financial pressure is the most obvious sign of stress," she said. "Both blue-collar and pink-collar workers are under a lot of financial pressure today because living in a high-cost area such as Westchester often takes two incomes, and if one income stops, the problems begin."
More Curtis employees have used the program this year than last, she said. "I think it's a sign of the times. They sought help in categories headed by financial-legal and marital, followed by alcohol and drug abuse."
Fred Collett, vice president for human resources of Hudson Valley National Bank in Yonkers, said Hudson Valley has had an employee assistance program for five years. "There was no mandate for an employee assistance program in our industry, but it was the result of a volunteer decision made by top management," Mr. Collett said. "They realized that employees' personal problems can adversely affect job performance, their attitude and their attendance. It's proven to be a cost-effective and timely benefit."

HEADLINE: Charities Say Tough Times Soften Hearts Of Donors

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
LIEUT. RONALD B. COX was on duty at the Salvation Army in Stamford earlier this month, when a man came in and said he had just stood behind a woman in a supermarket checkout line who had to return her Christmas turkey to the freezer, because she did not have the money to pay for all her groceries.
"This was a man who had never contributed to the Salvation Army in his life," Lieutenant Cox said. "He wrote me a check for $1,000." 
 That act of generosity was not an isolated incident. Despite an economy more sour than Scrooge before visitations from spirits, several charitable groups in the state report encouraging responses to holiday season appeals.
"This year we expected a serious lag in fund raising at Thanksgiving," said the Rev. William O. Johnson, director of A.B.C.D. Inc., the antipoverty agency in Bridgeport. "But we were able to raise $15,000, up slightly from last year, and we were able to help about 8,000 people." Mr. Johnson said he was heartened by the contributions. He cited the case of a woman who operates a soup kitchen in Bridgeport. When robbers took $1,000 worth of supplies from her, she received contributions worth $10,000 within a few days, he said. In Norwalk the assistant director of Family and Children's Aid, Patricia P. Benzien, said this year's donations to the organization's Holiday Gift Share program are triple those of 1990.
"When it comes to Christmas presents, people have just opened their hearts," Ms. Benzien said. "Giving has not reflected the economy."
The Rev. Kenneth L. Davis, of the Horace Bushnell Congregational Church in Hartford, said that 750 turkeys were donated within a few days after a newspaper reported that he needed 500 more to fill the needs of 1,600 needy families that had signed up for the church's Thanksgiving giveaway. The extra turkeys will be distributed at Christmas, he said.
 
'Stocked to the Ceiling'
 "I came in the first morning after the article appeared, and the phones were ringing off the hook -- people who wanted to donate money, people who wanted to buy us a turkey, people who got a turkey at work and wanted us to have it," Mr. Davis said. "A lot of people have realized that even if they're not in as good a shape as they were last year, there are a lot of people who are worse off."
Sister Joan D'Amato of the New Covenant House of Hospitality, which operates a food bank and soup kitchen for southwestern Connecticut, said: "I just came in and found 37 bags of food on the doorstep. The pantry is stocked to the ceiling."
Sister Joan said the donations of time, money and provisions are even more encouraging because people are being squeezed.
"Those who have been blessed, they call in and say God has been good to them, and they wish to do something for others," she said. "If you ever wanted to donate, the time is now."
Sister Joan noted that, unlike in the past, the nation's economic problems have become personal for many people in Fairfield County. "Everyone knows someone who has fallen on hard times," she said.
Ms. Benzien agreed that people who have enough to get by this year are much more aware of those who do not. While giving to the gift sharing program has tripled, she said, so have requests for children's gifts.
"Organizations like the Salvation Army do a little better when the economy is bad," Lieutenant Cox said. "When the economy is bad, the middle class person is hurting a little more, and they can relate more to people in need."
Noting that "we're a country of people who rise up to any crisis," Lieutenant Cox said that last year at this time his office had requests for almost 1,000 Christmas food baskets. This year more than 1,300 requests have come in. Last year at this time his office was handling about 300 social service cases a month; last month the number was 998.
"With Thanksgiving coming a week later than last year, it's created a bit of a problem -- how do you raise more money in less time?" Lt. Cox said. "It's still going to be a very, very tough Christmas."
And while people are giving food and other gifts, like clothing, the charities said they were short of cash.
"Raising food has never been a big problem," said the Rev. Kenneth P. Bonadies, director of the Christian Union Soup Kitchen in Hamden. "Where we have a problem is meeting our bills. Everyone is tight with money, but they have a can of food in the cupboard or a turkey in the freezer, and they're more likely to give it to us."
While special appeals have outpaced expectations, organizations that rely on financial pledges to be paid throughout the year have felt the downturn in the economy.
Susan Dunn, a spokeswoman for the United Way of the Capitol Area, said a campaign just ended raised $26.5 million, $500,000 more than last year, but only because of a $1.4 million emergency supplement initiative organized by the campaign chairman, George David, an executive vice president at United Technologies Corporation.
"We realized that three or four weeks from the end of our campaign we were way behind," Ms. Dunn said. "Our agencies are seeing a real explosion of need at a time when their funding from state sources is being cut. And we couldn't let that happen."
 
Poor Timing This Year
 The $1.4 million was raised in one-time special gifts, including a $100,000 challenge grant from an anonymous donor who matched any new giving of $500 or more, Ms. Dunn said.
She said the campaign starts every year on Oct. 1, which was poor timing this year. "That's right when state income tax withholding started," Ms. Dunn said. "So people were seeing a new deduction from their check. And here comes the United Way asking for more."
Ms. Dunn said layoffs by insurance companies and other employers eliminated about 15,000 jobs in the Hartford area since the 1990 campaign, so even though participation was good, the organization had to scramble, because it was working with a much smaller base.
In addition, the capitol area appeal relies heavily on state employees Ms. Dunn said. This year those employees were so worried about their own jobs, because of state cutbacks, they were reluctant to pledge heavily, she said.
"There were no hard feelings," Ms. Dunn said. "It's just that people said, 'These are tough times, and I have to think about my own family first.' ".
The acting president of the Combined Health Appeal of South Central Connecticut, Malcolm J. Doyle, said that the group was trying to equal last year's donations of $225,000, but that the total could fall about 10 percent short of that.
"The state income tax has really hurt charitable giving" at a time when many nonprofit groups are seeing their government funds cut back. Mr. Doyle said. "People just don't have the discretionary income they used to have."
 
Worries About the Winter
 Even charities that have benefited from the holiday largesse said they were worried about what would happen after Jan. 1. Without the holiday spirit, they said, donations could drop off.
"What's depressing is that even with all these donations that are coming in right now, we're still not going to be able to cover the need if we have a bad winter," said Mr. Johnson in Bridgeport.
Mr. Davis said: "People are very reluctant to commit to something they might not be able to follow through on. What's happening is good and bad. It's good in that we get an overwhelming response during the holidays. It's bad because this is the only time of the year a lot of people think about the needy.
"My job is really easy this time of year. I get one article in the newspaper or a notice on the radio, and the stuff comes rolling in. I can't do that in the summer. But hunger doesn't take a vacation. It's a year-round problem."

HEADLINE: Determining What Shapes a Successful School

BYLINE: By MERRI ROSENBERG

 BODY:
BY conventional wisdom, the American educational system is no match for its global counterpart. Politicians and pundits alike criticize the failures of the nation's schools, citing high drop-out rates, violence and teen-age pregnancy, illiteracy and deficient technological skills.
But there are some notable exceptions that defy the prevailing gloomy outlook. 
 Two Westchester high schools, in Bronxville and Pleasantville, were singled out earlier this fall as schools of excellence by President George Bush. The program, begun by President Reagan in 1982, recognizes successful schools and holds them up as models for other institutions.
 
No One Formula for Success
 To gain the honor, which was awarded to 222 other middle and high schools nationwide this year, a school must be nominated by state education officials. Applications include a description of the community's demographics and student population, as well as course offerings, extracurricular opportunities, disciplinary methods, student and faculty leadership procedures and any other distinctive programs.
If a school is selected for possible designation as a school of excellence, Federal Department of Education inspectors then visit to assess the school's operation. They try to determine how well these schools meet national goals in areas like literacy, multicultural diversity and fostering technological skills among students.
There is no single formula for scholastic success. But the Bronxville and Pleasantville schools offer telling insights into what ingredients can help shape successful schools.
"Both were very impressive," said Dr. Regina E. Hansen, a Department of Education inspector who is project director of the De La Salle Model, a program that helps at-risk high school students. "Their curriculum matched their clientele very well, and they developed a lot of creative and energizing programs. There was tremendous vitality at both schools."
The high schools in Bronxville and Pleasantville have relatively small student bodies. There are about 270 students in Bronxville, while Pleasantville has about 350. Both schools have attractive sites; the Bronxville school resembles an English Tudor-style building that could easily fit in on an Ivy League campus, while Pleasantville offers its students a tranquil, secluded suburban campus that features brightly lighted halls and abundant space.
And in both schools, the overwhelming majority of students are college bound, with 96 percent of Pleasantville's students going on for higher education, and nearly 100 percent of Bronxville alumni enrolled in college.
But those factors alone do not explain why these schools were singled out for recognition. What seems to make the difference are factors like a well-defined mission that the principal communicates to faculty and students; opportunities for staff and students to participate in decision making at the school; varied teaching techniques that address students' different abilities; strong parental and community involvement and support, and an ability to adapt to changing educational and social needs.
 
The Need for a Vision
 At these schools, apparently, leaders and teachers do more than pay lip service to the idea of individual needs. "It's important for a school to have a vision," said Dr. Donald A. Antonecchia, principal of Pleasantville High School for eight years. "We want our children to be ready for the challenges of the 21st century, and we want them to be drug free, literate and computer literate."
Toward that end, Pleasantville has developed an innovative program to stimulate student interest in writing. The school provides a wall in the main corridor that features the work of a different student writer and artist each month. These works are just as likely to come from learning disabled or average students as from advanced placement or honors students.
"We want to celebrate writing and make it as popular as football," Dr. Antonecchia said. And as part of the effort to develop literacy, Pleasantville students share creative writing workshops with students in Greenburgh's Woodlands High School.
To offer a more extensive curriculum than would be economically feasible in a district its size, Pleasantville is involved in long-distance learning programs to accommodate students whose academic interests would otherwise not be met by the school. Similarly, Pleasantville also includes an alternative education program to address the needs of students considered potential dropouts.
"You have to ask yourself whether you're meeting the needs of bright students, kids at risk for dropping out and the learning disabled," said Theresa Bronkowski, a guidance counselor at Pleasantville.
 
Going Beyond Standards
 One of the hallmarks of a school of excellence, according to Federal standards, is that students consistently exceed the minimum competency requirements set by the state. At Pleasantville, for example, 87 percent of the students take more than the required two years of mathematics. They also participate in community-service activities, including working in the elementary school, as part of their education.
Strong extracurricular and arts programs are also part of the recipe that makes for a successful school. Federal inspectors were impressed, for example, that Pleasantville's dramatic productions bring out parental and community involvement and support. Similar efforts were also cited at Bronxville.
Bronxville's innovations include a student-faculty legislature that lets students, teachers, parents and staff set the school's policies. "Students are empowered; everyone is empowered," said Michael Saltman, assistant principal at Bronxville High School.
The school also offers a seminar program that gives students the chance to tackle issues like self-esteem, leadership, group decision making and community service. Finally, Project Adventure, part of the physical-education curriculum, offers an Outward Bound-type of experience for ninth and tenth graders.
 
Range of Opportunities
 Despite its small size, Bronxville is able to offer an advanced-placement French class for seven students, or advanced-placement Spanish for four students. Yet students take classes in heterogeneous groups, and, Mr. Saltman said, "It's a tribute to our teachers that they can make the work challenging to everybody without being discouraging or simple."
While these schools are flattered by the attention that the designation as a "school of excellence" has bestowed upon them, neither is content to rest on laurels.
"It's very gratifying to be recognized, to have somebody else affirm what we know," Mr. Saltman said. "What we are trying to do is produce thinking students who are well grounded in the fundamentals and who are creative and thoughtful. But if you look at the best students in other countries, that consistently says to a school like Bronxville 'good as you may be, you have to be better.' "
Dr. Antonecchia added: "You're not in competition with other schools, but against yourself. You have to keep improving."

HEADLINE: Down and Out: When There's Nowhere Else to Go

BYLINE: By ELSA BRENNER

 BODY:
MARY PETERSON lives in an abandoned lot by the waterfront in Yonkers, with a grand view of the Palisades. By her standards, she says, she has exactly what she wants: the closeness of her family and the freedom to do as she pleases.
"There's no one making noise upstairs, nobody below and nobody complaining about my dogs," the 38-year-old woman said. "I don't take welfare, and I don't owe anyone anything. Just let me be free. I like it this way." 
 Ms. Peterson, her 51-year-old cousin, Peter Consadori, and her mother, who is blind from cataracts, live in two small trailers propped up on concrete blocks. Scrap wood in a makeshift fireplace outside burns night and day now that the weather has turned cold. Inside, a small propane stove warms the interior.
Ms. Peterson earns her living collecting scrap metal and crocheting hats and scarves. She lived in one place for most of her life and held various jobs in supermarkets and offices, she said, but when her father died seven years ago and her mother's sight began to fail, she moved her family from the Bronx to Westchester. She worked as a building superintendent for a time, sold castoffs at tag sales to earn money, but finally decided, "It wasn't worth the hassles."
 
A Different Story
 The three moved to their current home on public land several months ago, after being forced from another Yonkers site by the property owner. They are among the county's estimated 4,278 homeless people.
Michael Gallagher is 19, and he, too, does not have a place to live. But his story is quite different.
Mr. Gallagher stepped out of a van late one night last weekend and walked up the broad steps of the county's new emergency drop-in shelter for the homeless, the large bath house at Tibbetts Brook Park in Yonkers.
"I went to the streets a year ago," Mr. Gallagher said. "I've been in and out of shelters and the County Jail. I've been all over -- Los Angeles, Cincinnati. And here I am now."
He said he recently quit a job in Manhattan, at Macy's department store, and did what has been his habit since he can remember. "As usual," he said, "I burned all my bridges." He said he had had difficulties in school, had run away from home and later dropped out of a drug-rehabilitation program. "I know I have problems," he said. "But I'm trying to get myself together now."
Mr. Gallagher is one of a growing segment of the homeless population, young people in their late teens and early 20's, said Catherine J. Marsh, director of the Westchester division of the Volunteers of America, a nonprofit organization that is the state's largest provider of shelter services for single adults.
 
Second Only to New York City
 "The 18- to 20-year-olds, they are one of our biggest problems," Ms. Marsh said. "It's heartbreaking. For a lot of them, the future is not good."
"In a different economy or a different environment, they might have survived marginally," Ms. Marsh added. "But in Westchester we don't have flophouses or rooming homes. There's no place for them to go but to the streets."
As of October, the County Department of Social Services reports, there were 1,342 homeless single people and childless couples in Westchester along with 938 families, a category that included 1,074 adults and 1,862 children.
After New York City, Westchester has the largest number of homeless residents in the state. In two studies prepared by the State Department of Social Services last May, Westchester had 4,364 homeless residents. The next highest concentration of homeless was 914 in Suffolk County.
"We've been working nonstop on the issue of homelessness since 1983, when the problem grew bigger than our efforts to stem the tide," said Mary E. Glass, Acting Commissioner of the Department of Social Services.
The number of homeless rose sharply in the county during the late 1980's, to 4,455 in 1989 from 1,173 in January 1985. The numbers since then have stabilized, with 4,472 reported last year and 4,553 counted in January this year.
 
Motels Average $3,000 a Month
 The county's 1991 budget for sheltering the homeless and providing services to them is $72.6 million, with the cost of housing a homeless family in a motel averaging about $3,000 a month, Ms. Glass said. At the Westchester County Airport Shelter, the cost of providing housing, food and services for a single person runs $2,997 monthly.
But the costs are not the major problem, Ms. Glass said. The county, in fact, is coming in $17 million under budget this year.
"The biggest frustration," she said, "is the absence of affordable housing in Westchester. This is a difficult real estate market. By the year 2000, it will be more difficult yet. Government employees, social workers and even teachers cannot afford to live in Westchester, much less the homeless."
Local opposition to county-run housing for the homeless has also made it difficult for the Department of Social Services to move families out of motels and into permanent scatter-site shelters, Ms. Glass said. The county's 46 municipalities each have independent local zoning ordinances.
 
Transitional Housing Set Up
 The county has succeeded in establishing some transitional housing, including a 108-unit building next to Westchester Community College in Valhalla, a 106-unit family center in Elmsford and a 34-unit building in Mount Vernon. Because Westchester interprets the State Constitution as prohibiting a county from building housing, it contracts with nonprofit organizations to build and manage the housing.
Among organizations contracting with the county is Westhab, a nonprofit housing, development and social service agency, which administers 200 apartment units in 60 buildings for the homeless.
At the County Airport, the Volunteers of America runs a shelter for 58 singles; it also manages an annex for 19 in Ossining. The airport shelter also serves as an intake and assessment center, where the homeless receive physical examinations, psychiatric evaluations and addiction counseling. From there they are referred to residences and job-placement programs, Ms. Walsh said.
The Volunteers of America also runs the new emergency drop-in shelter in Tibbetts Brook Park, which was opened just before Thanksgiving.
 
Largest Concentration in Yonkers
 "A drop-in center keeps them out of the cold and alive," Ms. Walsh said, "but it doesn't help the homeless get back on their feet. That's where the assessment center comes in. We develop a plan."
The largest concentration of the county's homeless lives in Yonkers, where a total of 404 families with 831 children and 44 adults and 579 singles was counted in October. The Sharing Community operates two shelter programs in Yonkers. One provides accommodations for up to 55 homeless people, the other for 19.
The organization is a nonprofit one, founded in 1983 by members of the clergy and people from the community. "What we originally intended, nine years ago, to be just a temporary program is still here, because the problem keeps growing," said the Rev. George Anthony Hoeltzel, an Episcopal and the executive director of the Sharing Community.
Father Hoeltzel, a critic of what he calls the county's bureaucratic red tape in processing the homeless, said the Department of Social Services' intake procedures at the airport "scare away" many of the homeless.
 
Alternative Procedure Suggested
 "They are already frightened by the system," said Father Hoeltzel. "They look at an assessment procedure far from their neighborhood, and they tend to bolt and go back to fending for themselves."
Father Hoeltzel said the homeless should be admitted into the system by a county team that travels to neighborhood shelters where the homeless feel safe.
Anthony Wynne, who until last week was the executive director of the Coalition for the Homeless of Westchester, a Yonkers-based advocacy group, accused the county of using the three-day assessment as a "cover to throw people off the system, because if you don't show up, you don't get assistance."
"They're throwing a lot of red tape at people who can't handle it," he said.
 
Approach Called Humane
 Ms. Glass disagreed. "If a three-day assessment is too complicated, then that's their decision," she said. "The homeless are transported in vans to the airport, and they're not up to their armpits in forms."
"We ask them, 'How's your health?' and 'When did you last eat?' There are nurses and doctors and a humane approach. We try to identify the problems and make referrals. It's a very sensible system."
By law, a homeless person cannot spend more than one night in a county-financed shelter unless he is assessed by the Department of Social Services at the airport shelter.
In White Plains, the Rev. Peter Larom, another critic of some of the county's policies, oversees a 40-bed shelter at Grace Episcopal Church and the 19-bed Open Arms Shelter nearby.
 
'County Is Dragging Its Feet'
 "The county," he said, "is making the motel owners rich. What we need is more permanent low-income housing. I'm furious because the county is just dragging its feet on this issue."
Among Westchester's 1,295 homeless single people and childless couples in October, 370 were in shelters, 284 were in motels, 55 were in emergency-housing apartments and 586 were in a category called "made own arrangements," which means they were, like Ms. Peterson, homeless but not seeking housing placements from the Social Services Department.
Of the 938 homeless families in October, 273 had been placed by the county in motels, 205 were in emergency housing, 306 were in special family shelters and 154 had made their own arrangements.
Despite the criticism, Ms. Glass said she felt the county had made progress. "I think we're finally turning a corner and hitting a plateau in terms of numbers," she said. "To the extent that we can set aside our criticisms of each other and devote ourselves in a cooperative effort to solve this problem, we can lick it"

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
The Office Party Gets A Dose of Downsizing

BYLINE: By Nancy Marx Better

 BODY:
How many office parties will you attend this holiday season? If the answer is a scaled-back one -- or none -- you're not alone.
According to Battalia Winston International, a New York executive search firm that asked 500 of the country's largest companies about their holiday plans, it's beginning to look a lot less like Christmas across corporate America. While 66 percent of respondents were invited to company-wide galas and 16 percent were invited to departmental celebrations, 18 percent reported that no parties were planned at all in their offices. 
 "The results were pretty depressing," said Dale Winston, president of Battalia Winston. "When companies are going through a period of downsizing and eliminating jobs, nobody's in the mood for parties. It's not just an issue of saving money. It has to do with peoples' state of mind."
Cost-cutting measures range from shortening parties to holding them at lunchtime instead of at night. Some companies are asking employees to chip in a share of the expenses, or to buy drinks at a cash bar. "This isn't a time for excessive spending," Ms. Winston said. "It's embarassing for companies to act like we're still in the 80's."
Executives responsible for planning events are well aware of this. At Ogilvy & Mather Direct, a division of the New York advertising agency, past holiday parties were held at grand venues, including the New York Public Library and the Museum of Natural History. Last year's bash was a somewhat more subdued affair at the Tribeca Grill, a trendy Manhattan restaurant owned by Robert DeNiro. This year, employees toasted each other at the office last Thursday.
"Given the economy, we figured we should scale back," said Ray Rowell, an Ogilvy & Mather Direct spokesman. "But we wanted to do something to thank our people for all their hard work."
The theme of the event: "A Snowball in Hell" (the company is located in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood on the West Side of Manhattan). The invitation featured a styro foam snowball, there were decorations in the cafeteria and, instead of live entertainment, the 350 guests were treated to a rented Karaoke machine, the Japanese gadget that lets people sing along to recorded music.
With more and more companies entertaining on their own premises, restaurant owners are adapting. Some are trying for a profit by hosting a larger number of smaller parties.
Chris Carey, general manager of the Hudson River Club, a Wall Street area restaurant, said his business is up about 20 percent from last season. "Bookings from the Wall Street firms are solid, but not lavish," he said. "People are looking for more practical ways to do parties. They might go for a two-hour cocktail party, instead of four. They don't want to do a party that's too elaborate or ostentatious."
Amid all the penny pinching, experts advise executives to make the most of holiday parties. Ann Humphries, president of Eticon, a Columbia, S.C.-based etiquette consulting firm, lectures clients -- including Arthur Andersen, Hoechst-Roussel Pharmaceuticals and BellSouth Mobility -- about proper reception manners. "I tell people to eat before they go to parties, so they can concentrate on working the crowd," she said. "They should be out meeting people, not stuffing themselves with hors d'oeuvres."
In addition to suggesting conversation topics and instructing executives about how to make introductions, Ms. Humphries addresses strategic issues. "Everyone wants to know how to wedge into a cluster of people surrounding the C.E.O.," she said. "I tell them not to bother. Try to make eye contact with him, and give a nod. Then write a thank-you note the next day."
Most important, Ms. Humpries said, "Keep in mind that a holiday party is a business function, and that people are still judging you in a business capacity. You can't afford to let your guard down by drinking too much or acting unprofessional in any way."
Some executives will be relieved to be excused from parties entirely. Fundamental Brokers, a New York-based firm that sells Government securities, departed from its habit of chartering yachts and renting hotel ballrooms and is contributing upward of $30,000 to a charity group. "Hopefully, this will have a better impact on the community than taking our clients out for an endless evening of drinking," said Julie Epstein, a partner in the firm.
Other companies are incorporating charitable activities with holiday festivities. Recognizing the especially harsh impact of recession on New England, Reebok, the athletic footwear maker, is hosting a party for handicapped children in South Boston. But that's not all; the company is also holding a bash for 900 employees and their families, complete with clowns, games, prizes and a Santa Claus. "We like to bring everybody together during the holidays," said Bernadette Mansur, Reebok's vice president of communications. "It's become a tradition."
At McMillen Inc., the New York-based interior design firm whose clients include Rupert Murdoch and Carter Burden, employees have celebrated in the same fashion for 75 years. "We decorate our offices, and we drink egg nog from the recipe of Eleanor Brown, a founder of our company," said Betty Sherrill, McMillen's president.
But even tradition can take on an unconventional spin. In late 1988, after the financier Sandy Weill acquired Primerica, his staff sang Christmas carols around a fire in the office library. Flush with merriment, a couple of staffers penned new words to an old patriotic standard. Result: "God Bless Primerica." "Now it's become a tradition," said Mary McDermott, a company spokeswoman. A new stanza appears each year.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
At Princeton University on Thursday, Secretary of State James Baker announced a new strategy to deal with the grave risks arising from the social and economic disintegration of the former Soviet Union. His speech recalled Secretary of State George Marshall's historic address at Harvard in 1947, launching the reconstruction of a devastated Western Europe.
But time is crucial, as it was in 1947. While an airlift of some essentials begins this week, the main planning -- the "coordination conference" -- is not to convene until mid-January. This delay is highly risky, given how close the former Soviet Union is to chaos. What Marshall said of Europe 44 years ago applies to the Soviet economy today: "The patient is sinking while the doctors deliberate." 
 Twentieth-century history is littered with "what ifs" -- catastrophes and evils that might have been avoided by prudent action. We may look back and realize that this was one of those junctures when a great opportunity slipped away. The West may demand reforms before aid, but the reformers may not survive long enough to get around to the reforms.
We must get food shipments moving on a sufficient scale, and take the program out of election-year politics. The Soviets need a "Strategic Food Initiative." This would work in the same way that the U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve does: it insures that supplies are plentiful enough to counteract hoarding and panic buying. Once the hoarders learned of Western intentions to supply the Soviet Union with food, they would have no reason to hold on to supplies.
Food shipments by the West will further help defuse the crisis as Russia and other republics prepare to free prices and move to a market system. The main targets should include big cities, the Urals industrial region and hard-pressed Armenia. It is critical to feed the cities: That is where food is in shortest supply and where revolutions or counterrevolutions are most likely to begin. The likelihood of panics and upheavals increases day by day. The West can make a crucial difference, and we need the resulting influence to support the move to democracy and markets and help stabilize the Soviet nuclear arsenal.
The initiative should be coordinated by the Group of Seven, to avoid duplication and conflicts. The Japanese need to move beyond pledges of funds to actual expenditure. Results would be almost immediate if the European Community financed the shipment of Polish and Hungarian food surpluses to the Soviet Union.
The Bush Administration should appoint an administrator for the Strategic Food Initiative with the skill and stature to cut through the many Gordian knots. At the same time, leading U.S. agricultural cities, like Des Moines and Omaha, should establish partner relationships with Soviet cities, engaging farm and business groups and spearheading deliveries. This would strengthen the people-to-people character of the Strategic Food Initiative and make it less political. The U.S. mayors could visit their Soviet counterparts as soon as possible.
The difficulty would come once the food was in the Soviet Union, where the distribution system has broken down. One channel for the initiative could be through local city leaders, who in turn could arrange use of empty stores. The proceeds from the sale of the food would be put in accounts to finance the privatization of state enterprises (on which the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development would help). There could also be direct delivery to the most vulnerable groups, old people and children. Inevitably, some food would be wasted or end up on the black market, but most supplies would get through.
To work, the Strategic Food Initiative needs leadership. The Administration and Congress must together respond and develop a consensus that swift, comprehensive action is in the crucial interest of the U.S. in these first unsteady days after the death of the Soviet Union.

VICTORIAN AMERICA
Transformations in Everyday Life,
1876-1915.
By Thomas J. Schlereth.
Illustrated. 363 pp. New York:
HarperCollins Publishers.
$27.50. 
 IN the epigraph to "Victorian America," his new book about everyday life in America in the 40 years preceding World War I, Thomas J. Schlereth cites the historian Siegfried Giedion's claim that "for the historian there are no banal things." Consider the safety razor and disposable blades patented by King Gillette in 1895. Until their invention, men had three choices: to grow beards, to make regular trips to the barber, or to court certain discomfort and probable injury by shaving at home with caked soap and straight razors. The safety razor, Mr. Schlereth observes, "not only contributed to the full beard's decline and spared men frequent trips to the barber shop," but as Gillette's advertisements proclaimed, it provided " 'the modern man' with an opportunity each day to be the 'master' of his own time and appearance." Ironically, as Mr. Schlereth comments, "its successful promotion established greater male uniformity in personal grooming. . . . Soldiers in World War I were provided with 3.5 million Gillette razors and 32 million blades to keep the armed forces looking clean shaven, trim, athletic, energetic, and youthful.' "
Thomas Schlereth's book is full of capsule histories like this, packaged into chapters about moving, working, housing, consuming, communicating, playing, striving, and living and dying. Framing the chapters are a prologue, "interlogue" and epilogue on the world's fairs of 1876, 1893 and 1915, where scores of new products -- from ready-made shoes in 1876 to dollar watches in 1915 -- were introduced to the American public. The book is illustrated with black-and-white reproductions of photographs, posters, cartoons and advertisements of the period.
Others have described this era in United States history by focusing on the rise of the corporation, or the city, or the professional middle classes. Mr. Schlereth does not. His book is, in fact, without any real thesis or connecting threads to bind his disparate mini-essays conceptually. Still, in his relentless piling on of information and his encyclopedic grasp of the era's material culture, he succeeds in accomplishing what he sets out to do. Mr. Schlereth, a professor of American studies at the University of Notre Dame, tells the story of everyday life in America by examining the objects that Americans lived with and for.
At times the cataloguing of case histories is a bit confusing, as when Mr. Schlereth, in the chapter on working, follows a discussion of the daily lives of agrarian workers with a brief history of meat packing, tobacco processing and cigarette manufacturing. And yet, even when the arrangement is confusing, the individual studies are fascinating. In the section called "Packing and Canning," for example, we learn how industrial workers and capitalists like Gail Borden, H. J. Heinz and James Buchanan (Buck) Duke transformed the nation's cooking, eating and smoking habits by preserving milk in cans, meat in tins, pickles in jars and leaf tobacco in cigarettes -- all of which could be shipped across the country in railroad cars and stored on shelves until taken home by shoppers.
"Why did American consumer habits gain such momentum from 1876 to 1915?" Mr. Schlereth asks. Because, he explains, "more people . . . had more money and more time to purchase more goods, mass-produced more cheaply and advertised more widely."
The coming of what Lewis Mumford called "the goods life" transformed every aspect of daily existence in America, including the domestic arrangements we tend to think of as timeless. In the early 19th century, householders began to separate their "sleeping quarters from social ones, using their parlor as a ceremonial and social space." In the early 20th century, nurtured by "etiquette manuals, domestic advisers, and furniture manufacturers," and fed by an avalanche of mass-produced, marketed and advertised commodities, the parlor became a national institution, transcending "social class, economic status, or geographic location."
Women in suburban bungalows, city tenements and rural farmhouses, Mr. Schlereth notes, assembled overstuffed "gender distinctive" furniture (thronelike chairs for the men, armless chairs for the women), brightly colored lithograph prints and mass-produced bric-a-brac in formal parlors where "marriages, wakes, clergymen's calls, holy day and holiday celebrations" were staged and the family's "treasured possessions" and history ("framed photographs, marriage certificates, and the like") were put on exhibit. The modern bathroom was also invented in this period, as householders with indoor plumbing brought together in one room the toilet from the outhouse or closet, the washbowl from the bedchamber and the tub from the kitchen.
Not all Americans were able to decorate parlors or afford elaborate bathrooms. Nor were they all comfortable with the encroachments of progress as defined by a newly ascendant "Victorian middle-class coalition." Mr. Schlereth narrates the outsiders' story as well, though perhaps not in as much detail as he might. He tells us not only about the scientific managers who tried to raise efficiency by regimenting factory labor, but also about the workers who struck rather than accept the discipline of the stopwatch; not only about merchandisers like Sears, Roebuck and Montgomery Ward who sold everything from the "Instant Home" to embalming fluid through the mails, but also about country storekeepers and small-town merchants who fought back by lobbying against rural free delivery and parcel post and urging townspeople and farmers to turn in their catalogs to fuel a "Home Town Industry Jubilee and Bonfire" in the public square.
MR. SCHLERETH'S range is extraordinary. On almost every page we encounter a new item with its own particular history. Root beer, we learn, was created as "the National Temperance Drink" by Charles E. Hires, a Philadelphia pharmacist. The lawnmower, "put into large-scale production by several American firms by the 1870s, contributed to the trend to make the lawn a necessary element of the suburban house." Until this date, homeowners had cut their grass but once or twice a season, and "only country estates and city mansions had large, manicured lawns."
In the end, accumulating detail on top of detail, Thomas Schlereth succeeds in demonstrating the truth of Siegfried Giedion's statement, reproduced in his epigraph: "The humble objects of which we speak have shaken our modes of living to its very roots. Modest things of daily life, they accumulate into forces acting upon whoever moves within the objects of our civilization."

HEADLINE: Democrats Debate Over Taxes and '92 Funds

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
In the first nationally televised debate of the 1992 campaign, the six major candidates for the Democratic Presidential nomination squabbled fiercely among themselves tonight over tax policy and the role of special interest money in the Democratic Party.
The debate, held on NBC nine weeks before New Hampshire's primary on Feb. 18, found the Democrats united in attacking President Bush's foreign policy and economic stewardship. They asserted that Mr. Bush had presided over economic decline at home and an uncertain, anachronistic foreign policy that had failed to adjust to the end of the cold war. 
 But the Democratic attack on the opposition often gave way to even angrier exchanges among themselves. Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California, considered one of the longer shots in the race, often drove the debate with his repeated assertions that special interests were "buying politicians" and the American people "had lost control" of their political system to career politicians.
At one point, Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska turned to Mr. Brown and noted, with a very tight jaw, that Mr. Kerrey had run for office for the first time in 1982, when Mr. Brown was already a "a full-time politician." Mr. Kerrey added: "I resent all this PAC and special interest stuff. Are you saying I'm bought and paid for? I resent that."
In between the fighting, the candidates each tried to present both a little personal history, a lot of message and some careful positioning. Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who seemed to be trying to present a cool, understatedimage for the television audience, used the opportunity to talk about his concern for the middle class. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia delivered an impassioned defense of affirmative action policies, while assailing the Republicans for permitting a deterioration of race relations.
Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts talked of his economic expertise, and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa stuck with his pledge for a huge public works program to put people back to work. Mr. Kerrey talked about the need for fundamental rethinking of domestic and foreign policy in the aftermath of the cold war.
The debate, moderated by Tom Brokaw, was the first of seven nationally televised debates to be held among the major candidates for the Democratic nomination, a critical chance at prime-time exposure for a field still struggling for money and recognition.
National polls show that most of the candidates in this late-starting race have barely penetrated the public's consciousness. And the potential candidate who has probably made the strongest impression among Democrats, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, has muddied the field with two months of indecision. That may reach a resolution by Friday, the filing deadline for the New Hampshire primary.
 
Specialized Audience
 Beyond the voters at large, the candidates tonight were wooing another, more specialized audience: the political professionals and financial contributors who need to be persuaded of a candidate's viability.
The candidates disagreed sharply over tax cuts for the middle class, an idea that got vocal backing from Mr. Kerrey, Mr. Wilder and Mr. Clinton. Mr. Tsongas, a critic of what he describes as traditional Democratic economics, asserted that cutting taxes for the middle class was an idea straight out of public opinion polls. Mr. Harkin scornfully brandished a dollar bill to demonstrate his assertion that this was all the middle class family would get each day from his opponents' tax cut.
"What the middle class needs is jobs," Mr. Harkin said.
One of the clearest image-building efforts under way tonight was Mr. Kerrey's attempt to tell his personal story to a national audience. Mr. Kerrey, a Navy commando who lost his leg and won the Medal of Honor for heroism in Vietnam, repeatedly referred to his past as he talked of his views on both foreign and domestic policy.
He said he would "take nothing away" from what American forces had accomplished in the war in the Persian Gulf, but he rebuked Mr. Clinton for suggesting that all Democrats should concede that Mr. Bush had acted wisely. Mr. Kerrey voted against the use of force in the Persian Gulf and tonight criticized Mr. Bush for never clearly explaining his actions, noting that Saddam Hussein was "still alive and still running and still terrorizing the people of Iraq itself."
 
Position of Grim Prophet
 At one point, Mr. Kerrey referred to remarks by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d that the action related to American jobs. "He said this is about 'jobs, jobs, jobs,' and where are the jobs?" Mr. Kerrey asked.
The other clear attempt at image-building was Mr. Brown's repeated effort to position himself as the grim prophet of political corruption. He rode over Mr. Brokaw's injunction to avoid fund-raising appeals and twice gave his 800 number.
He jabbed at most of his fellow candidates and seemed to keep them off stride. Sometimes they seemed amused, more often they did not.
One effect of this, perhaps, was Mr. Clinton's surprisingly muted performance tonight, after a series of speeches in which he got good reviews from party audiences.
Another was that the debate turned into a free-wheeling, angry clash on the nature of the political system instead of the smooth and unified attack that party leaders had hoped to launch against a President sagging in the public opinion polls.
 
Reasons for Running
 Mr. Brokaw asked each man why he sought the nomination. Senator Harkin, who has urged a return to old-time Democratic values, said he was driven by his sense that President Bush was out of touch with the suffering of the American people.
Mr. Tsongas, who campaigns as a pro-business liberal, said he decided to run after concluding that the "old-style Democratic message" offered no hope of economic growth.
Senator Kerrey said President Bush was too closely tied to the past and the cold war.
Mr. Brown said Americans had lost control of their political system, losing their voice, he said, as monied interests captured the electoral process.
Governor Clinton said he had the most comprehensive strategy for a struggling middle class.
Governor Wilder cited his record in balancing the budget in Virginia without a tax increase and said he could do the same for the nation.
While many of the candidates tried to distance themselves from Democratic orthodoxy, they also suggested that Democrats should not be ashamed to embrace some of the party's traditional causes.
Governor Clinton, for example, said he welcomed the opportunity to talk about welfare. He said he agreed with Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, that the nation should provide more education and training, health insurance and adequate child care, so welfare recipients could obtain jobs.
Asked about the merits of affirmative-action progams for women and minorities, Governor Wilder said there should be a clear distinction between quotas and other forms of affirmative action that he finds essential."I wouldn't hire anyone based on a quota," Mr. Wilder said. "The playing field has not been level," Mr. Wilder said, referring to the United States' history of job discrimination against blacks and women. "There has to be some affirmative response to the years" of systematic denial of job opportunities for such people, he said.
On military spending, Governor Clinton said, "the defense budget was based on the existence of the Soviet Union," adding, "We spent billions of dollars to win the cold war." He said the United States "should help them get through the winter," but said that it also should spend money to dismantle Soviet nuclear weapons.
Governor Wilder and Senator Harkin both said food aid to the former Soviet republics should be conditioned on further reductions in their military, especially reductions in nuclear weapons.
Senator Harkin said that as the Soviet Union disintegrated, President Bush had missed an opportunity to negotiate cuts in tactical nuclear weapons. Reminded by Mr. Brokaw that Mr. Bush and the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, both recently endorsed such reductions, he called these agreements "sort of fluff and everything," and said that Soviet weapons should be put under control of inspectors for the International Atomic Energy Agency.
 
Warning of Takeover
 But Mr. Tsongas said that unless the United States sent aid quickly, a right wing or military takeover might occur. He called for sending about $1 billion or $2 billion now in the military budget to aid the collapsed Soviet empire.
The Democrats all criticized Mr. Bush on foreign policy, arguing that he had failed to react properly and promptly to the rapid developments in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
Mr. Brown suggested that the United States "work with the Europeans" to end the conflict in Yugoslavia. He did not directly answer the question of whether this meant sending American troops or just aid.
Senator Kerrey said Mr. Bush was "getting cold feet at the wrong time," by failing to come up with an economic plan of aid and cooperation with the emerging commonwealth in the Soviet Union. He also called for a coordinated response by the United States and the other industrialized nations to shore up the economy of the commonwealth by stabilizing the ruble.
"The President is not moving boldly enough," Mr. Kerrey said.
The candidates also found fault with Mr. Bush's handling of Japan.
Mr. Tsongas said that when the President traveled to Japan next month he should tell the Japanese that the cold war was over and that "the time for fair trade is here." Mr. Tsongas said Mr. Bush should tell the Japanese, "It's time to open up your trade doors to our products."
Governor Clinton said Japan was now at least as rich as the United States and should bear a bigger share of responsibility for its own defense.
"We're going to insist on fair trade," Mr. Clinton vowed. But the Arkansas Governor said also that "we ought to learn something from the Japanese," and said the United States had stubbornly refused to develop the social policies and human resources needed to compete effectively with Japan.
 
Aiming at Trade Deficit
 Senator Harkin noted that although the United States was a creditor nation when President Ronald Reagan was inaugurated the country now had a trade deficit. "I would tell the Japanese that in my term as President we are going to reduce that trade deficit to zero," he said.
Asked about a proposed free-trade agreement with Mexico, Governor Wilder said he would strive to protect American jobs. Businesses "have moved out of Virginia to Mexico, where labor is cheap," he said.
Senator Harkin asserted that the Bush Administration was "taking jobs from this country, lowering our living standards and the living standards of people in Latin America." He urged that the United States insist that Mexican workers have health care, social security and other benefits enjoyed by American workers.
Mr. Clinton took issue with the President's decision to provide most-favored-nation trading status to China.
"He let his friendships in China obscure what those kids did in Tiananmen Square," the Governor said.
Mr. Brown accused the Republicans of repeatedly lying both about Administration policies in the Middle East and arms shipments to Iran.
"We're not getting the truth," he said. Asked to elaborate, he said, "I'm accusing them of not really talking straight to the American people."
Driven by Mr. Brown, much of the debate centered around the system of financing political campaigns. Mr. Tsongas challenged the other candidates to make an immediate vow: "Everybody pledge tonight, no more PAC money after tonight."
Mr. Harkin replied: "That is about the phoniest argument I ever heard. You received over $7,000 from eight executives" of an electronics company.
On the issue of abortion, the arguments were mainly about whether the candidates would insist that judicial candidates embrace Roe v. Wade, the 1973 court decision that made abortion a constitutional right.
Senator Harkin said he "would not appoint any Supreme Court nominee that wanted to overturn Roe v. Wade, period." Governor Clinton said that the Roe precedent was right and that if it was overturned there should be Federal legislation to insure that women could choose to have an abortion. Senator Kerrey, saying he expected the Court to overturn Roe v. Wade, promised to introduce legislation that would preserve the legality of abortion.

HEADLINE: SOVIET DISARRAY;
RUSSIA ASKS BAKER FOR A RECOGNITION OF INDEPENDENCE

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 15

 BODY:
The Russian republic asked the United States today to recognize its independence and that of Byelorussia and Ukraine, a move that could force Washington to choose between President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and the new commonwealth led by Boris N. Yeltsin.
The Russian Foreign Minister, Andrei Kozyrev, made the request to the visiting Secretary of State, James A. Baker 3d, saying recognition would help crystallize authority in the new commonwealth and prevent a slide toward further political disintegration. Mr. Baker said the United States would consider the request. 
 American recognition of Russia's independence would end any hopes Mr. Gorbachev might still have of holding together some remnant of the old union, with himself at the center.
 
Signals to Gorbachev
 With that prospect, some American officials today for the first time clearly signaled by words and deeds that they hoped that Mr. Gorbachev would either leave the stage or make an accommodation with the new commonwealth before they have no choice but to come out against him.
That was apparent in the fact that Mr. Baker, along with Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney, pointedly took issue today with remarks made by Mr. Gorbachev in an interview with Time magazine. Mr. Gorbachev had criticized a Baker assessment last week that the Soviet Union "as we know it" is finished.
While Mr. Baker was more reserved in his public remarks, Mr. Cheney declared in a television interview that Mr. Gorbachev was not recognizing reality. He added that if he did not do so soon, the United States should abandon its neutrality in the internal power struggle and come down on the side of the new commonwealth.
 
'Have to be Hard-Nosed'
 "We have to be very hard-nosed about our approach, and we have to recognize reality," Mr. Cheney said on the NBC News program "Meet the Press," adding:
"And reality is that that there has been a new commonwealth formed, that in forming that commonwealth, the republics, in effect, said 'The center is dead, the old Soviet Union is dead, and now we've got to get on with a new organization,' and we've got to deal with that new mechanism. Reality is now being shaped primarily by Boris Yeltsin and other leaders."
Mr. Kozyrev, the Russian Foreign Minister, said after meeting with Mr. Baker that he understood that the United States was in a delicate position and did not want to appear to be interfering in internal affairs.
Nevertheless, in a news conference with Mr. Baker after their two hours of talks in the Russian Foreign Ministry, Mr. Kozyrev said: "Basically we do ask now for full diplomatic recognition of independent states, those which created this new commonwealth. This will help crystallize authority, which stems from the people's vote in Ukraine, Russia and Byelorussia, and stop the further disintegration."
In the rush to sovereignty after the collapse of the Kremlin coup in August, Russia did not join most republics in formally declaring independence, but it did so in effect a week ago in declaring the formation of the commonwealth with Ukraine and Byelorussia. Since then, they have been joined by five Central Asian republics.
Mr. Baker, while reiterating his standard line about not wanting to interfere in the internal affairs of the former Soviet Union, said, "We will obviously be looking at the suggestion that has been made here, just as we are now looking at a similar request from the Ukraine."
The United States has already welcomed Ukraine's independence and said it will extend de jure recognition and open an embassy in Kiev after it is satisfied that the Ukraine government has met certain basic American principles. These include either destroying its nuclear weapons or putting them under a single central control, agreeing to respect minorities' rights, taking some responsibility for Soviet debt and agreeing that any border changes can come about only by negotiation.
Mr. Baker told the Russians that their adherence to those principles would also determine how the United States responds to their request.
 
Commonwealth in Progress
 American officials added that while their discussions today made clear that the tide here is overwhelmingly in favor of the new commonwealth, and not Mr. Gorbachev's union proposals, the whole commonwealth plan is still very much a work in progress, and that some of the most basic questions about how the member republics will relate to one another politically, economically and militarily still have not been worked out. This has been an important factor in American reluctance to openly embrace the idea up until now.
The Russian request for recognition came just a few hours after Mr. Baker landed in Moscow, carrying aboard his Air Force 707 medical supplies for hospitals in Minsk, the Byelorussian capital; Yerevan, the Armenian capital, and Moscow. Two other cargo jets, one American and the other Soviet, left Andrews Air Force Base in Washington shortly after he did with more medical supplies and food destined for other hard-hit Soviet cities and children's hospitals.
On the flight from Washington, the Secretary of State responded to Mr. Gorbachev criticism of Mr. Baker's declaration a week ago that "the Soviet Union as we know it" no longer exists.
In the Time interview, Mr. Gorbachev said: "Mr. Baker was overly hasty in saying, 'The Soviet Union no longer exists.' Things are in flux here. While we're still trying to figure things out, the U.S. seems to know everything already. I don't think that's loyalty, particularly toward those of us who favor partnership."
 
Long Support Cited
 Mr. Baker, briefing reporters at the start of his five-day trip, responded: "If it's true, that it was a criticism, then I would regret it, because I don't think anyone has been more supportive of President Gorbachev and indeed his administration and what they have done, than I have -- both privately and publicly -- in the counsels of the United States Government and otherwise. I have been outspoken in praising him and saying none of this would have happened but for one man, Mikhail Gorbachev. I greatly admire and respect him."
Although much of Mr. Baker's briefing was given on condition it not be attributed to him, he pointedly allowed those remarks to be attributed.
His disagreement with the Soviet President seemed to reflect not only irritation with Mr. Gorbachev's criticism of the Bush Administration -- which stuck with him long after many experts advised it otherwise -- but also a mounting awareness among American officials that Mr. Gorbachev's insistence on clinging to power may be now impeding the seemingly inevitable transition here from the old Soviet Union to a commonwealth.
It was noteworthy that Mr. Baker met first with Russia's Foreign Minister, and only then did he dine privately with the Soviet Government's Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, an old friend.
 
Meeting Yeltsin First
 Mr. Baker's first meeting Monday will be with Mr. Yeltsin in St. Catherine's Hall in the Kremlin -- the room where he always met in the past with Mr. Gorbachev. He meets with Mr. Gorbachev later, in a different room.
In Washington, in the last week President Bush has spoken to Mr. Yeltsin twice on the telephone, in what White House officials described as "substantive" policy conversations. In that time, Mr. Bush has spoken only once to Mr. Gorbachev to get his "assessment" of the situation.
Mr. Kozyrev hinted that Mr. Yeltsin's military aides for the Baker meeting would be a surprise. The Russian Foreign Minister seemed to be suggesting that the lineup would make it clear that the key elements of the Soviet Army and Strategic Rocket Forces, which oversee intercontinental ballistic missiles, were now firmly with Mr. Yeltsin.
Asked if he could offer fresh assurances that nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union are under tight control, Mr. Kozyrev said: "Follow very closely tomorrow's composition of the Russian side of the negotiating table. This will be very interesting -- like the old days with the Politburo on Lenin's masoleum. Please take notice of this thing."
Mr. Yeltsin's aides are now confident that the Russian President has won the allegiance of Defense Minister Yegeny I. Shaposhnikov, commander of the union forces. 

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Mitterand Criticizes U.S.
 PARIS, Dec. 15 (Special to The New York Times) -- President Francois Mitterrand today criticized the Bush Administration's proposal to hold an international conference in Washington next month to coordinate humanitarian aid to the fragmenting Soviet Union.
In a television interview, Mr. Mitterrand said that the meeting, proposed last week by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, would be superfluous and that Western Europe was already providing large amounts of emergency food and other aid to the Soviet republics.
"European nations now give a lot more aid than the United States does," he said. "So President Bush's request all of a sudden to meet in Washington to coordinate these efforts seems to be rather superfluous."
He also criticized Mr. Bush for not responding to his proposal that the United States, France, Britain and the Soviet Union meet to discuss ways to insure nuclear security. 

 	 	 		--------------------	 	
 
Report on Gorbachev
 MOSCOW, Dec. 15 (AP) -- In another sign of the dramatic ebb in Mr. Gorbachev's influence, Soviet and Russian television reported that Mr. Yeltsin had met with the General Shaposhnikov to discuss matters indlucing the selection of a new commander in chief - a job that is now held by Mr. Gorbachev.
 The meeting took place late Saturday but was reported only today. The two discussed most unresolved questions about the military's future in the commonwealth, including the nuclear arsenal, the Soviet and Russian television reports said.
 It said the leaders also discussed possible candidates of the commonwealth, but gave no names.

HEADLINE: Two Hospitals, Two Missions -- A Special Report.;
A Health Care Quandary Over Training of Doctors

BYLINE: By LISA BELKIN

 BODY:
To administrators at the Long Island Jewish Medical Center, Dr. Salvatore J. Corso is a student and his patients are his textbooks.
"I need multiple injuries, high-speed injuries, car accidents, gunshot wounds," says Dr. Corso, who is near the end of a five-year residency in orthopedic surgery. His education will not be complete, he adds, if he only sees "bread and butter" cases like "an 8-year-old with a thigh fracture." 
 To administrators at Queens Hospital Center, however, Dr. Corso is, above all, an employee. They are sympathetic to his training needs, but there are patients to be seen. Thousands of patients. And many are 8-year-olds with broken legs.
 
Troubled Marriage
 This dual view of Dr. Corso is the reason Long Island Jewish, a private hospital determined to be a major academic institution, announced this month that it would end its 26-year-old agreement to provide doctors to Queens Hospital Center, a public hospital struggling to meet its patients' basic needs.
In many ways, the troubled marriage and messy divorce of Long Island Jewish and Queens Hospital is a very specific tale. Of the 11 contracts between New York City's public hospitals and the private institutions paid to staff them, the one severed two weeks ago has long been the most troubled.
But the story of these two Queens hospitals is in many ways the story of the health care system in New York, where lack of money creates new problems and makes old ones bigger. Hospitals reflect the worst of a city, and as New York has changed over the decades so have its hospitals. The crises that Long Island Jewish find impassable are found throughout New York: AIDS, homelessness, poverty, drugs, violence and budgets grossly inadequate to the task.
And so the questions Queens Hospital and Long Island Jewish are asking each other are being asked all over New York: How can doctors be found to work in the dismay and violence of many city hospitals? What responsibility does the medical profession have for providing care despite those conditions? How can hospitals reconcile the often clashing missions of training doctors and caring for patients?
"We train doctors who go on to take care of patients and to train other doctors," said Dr. Robert K. Match, president of Long Island Jewish. "We can't continue to do that there."
Arnoline Jones, executive director of Queens Hospital, said: "Number one, I have to worry about delivering patient care. Number two, I worry about training doctors. I can't always get to number two."
The affiliation contracts, which have been under renegotiation in recent months, began in the mid 1960's. Curiously, they resulted from an economic climate that is being likened to this one. Hard times had crippled the city's health-care budget and hospitals could not find good doctors, or, often, any doctors, to staff them. The result was a relationship between New York City's public and private hospitals that is unlike any other in the country: Private institutions -- medical schools, medical corporations and, in the case of Long Island Jewish, other medical centers -- are paid to staff public hospitals.
Long Island Jewish received $40 million last year to do that from the Health and Hospitals Corporation, which runs the city's public hospitals. The money is to hire medical residents, who provide almost all the day-to-day medical care, and the senior doctors, who supervise them. The corporation pays more than $400 million a year for its staffing contracts.
In theory, each side gains. The doctors working in the public hospitals are technically private employees, and the prestige and security of those jobs means they can be filled by better doctors than the public hospitals might be able to recruit on their own. In turn, the medical residents being trained at the private institutions receive broader experience than they might otherwise have.
One medical school administrator summed up the contracts this way: "They need our doctors. We need their patients."
But in recent years that equation has become unbalanced, and nowhere are the strains more evident than at Queens Hospital and Long Island Jewish.
 
Depression Buildings Look It
 Queens Hospital has needed repair for decades but, Long Island Jewish officials say, the crumbling has accelerated in the last five years. Most of the 14 buildings on the 20-acre Jamaica campus were built during the Depression. They are drab, cramped, tired places, where every floor feels somewhat like a basement.
The 240,000 patients seen in the hospital's 80 clinics every year are more than the hospital can handle, Dr. Match said. The wait for a clinic appointment, four to six weeks a year ago, is now two to three months.
Construction of a $493 million, 589-bed building is scheduled to begin next fall and be completed in 1994. Until then, short-term renovation is under way. More than $25 million has been spent on improvements over the last five years, Mrs. Jones said, ranging from $48,000 for a walk-in refrigerator for medication to $7 million for a new surgical operating room.
Queens Hospital officials concede that the money has merely dented the problem. On one medical ward, for instance, beds are placed along an open corridor with no walls or doors for privacy. Recently, $100,000 was spent to replace the floors and put curtains between the patients.
"It's not great but at least it's not a nightmare," said Richard Langfelder, deputy executive director of operations at Queens Hospital.
A few floors away, in a unit that felt like a sauna because the thermostats were on the blink, Robert Rossdale, senior associate director of support services, pointed with some pride to the new television sets that had finally been bought to break the monotony for recuperating surgical patients. "We do what we can," he said. "It's an old hospital."
 
The Doctors
Trying to Stem White-Coat Flight
 It is also, said Dr. Match and others at Long Island Jewish, an inadequately staffed hospital. Last year for the fifth year in a row, Dr. Match said, the effective budget for staff salaries was reduced, by 3.85 percent. Last year alone, he said, 46 staff positions were eliminated. Of those, 25 were doctors and the rest were support staff like technicians, respiratory therapists and records clerks.
As a result, he said, doctors and residents are spending time on tasks that should be done by someone else, like digging through charts for X-rays and moving patients from one room to another. Earlier this year, he said, the pediatric residents at Queens Hospital complained they were being used improperly.
Mrs. Jones and others who speak for Queens Hospital argue that it is precisely because things are so bad that Long Island Jewish has an obligation to extend its contract.
"If everything was perfect we wouldn't need them the way we do," Mr. Langfelder said. Passing a group of children playing on the floor of a waiting area he shook his head and said, "What is L.I.J. thinking?"
Mrs. Jones added: "I thought they took an oath. I thought that oath went beyond any contract."
Mrs. Jones said Queens Hospital was doing its best to make things easier for the doctors. A computer system was recently installed that allows any patient's laboratory results to be found almost instantly. An "IV team" of nurses and technicians was established to insert intravenous lines so doctors do not have to.
But Dr. Match says the improvements are not enough. The poor conditions at Queens Hospital make it difficult to find doctors to work there, he said in his office five miles away at Long Island Jewish, which was built between 1954 and 1988.
 
Doctors Avoid New York City
 The goal of Long Island Jewish, he said, "is not to be a community hospital."
"Our goal is to be the best," he said. "The best occurs in an environment where teaching and learning and research can take place."
To be the "best," he said, requires the best educated residents and the best senior doctors to teach them.
Doctors, he said, do not want to work at Queens Hospital. In fact, doctors do not want to work at most New York City hospitals. A study published by The Journal of the American Medical Association last month found that while the number of residency slots in New York increased by 4 percent, the number of young doctors choosing to train in New York decreased by 28 percent, a drop the study attributed mostly to the omnipresence of AIDS but also variously to budget cuts, nursing shortages, sicker patients, addicts, "family considerations" and "life style factors."
This white-coat flight from the city is a problem for all the public hospitals. But it has several added wrinkles for Long Island Jewish.
One is that residents who choose city hospitals seem to be drawn to the prestige and academic challenge of the medical schools affiliated with them. But Long Island Jewish is the only affiliated hospital without a medical school.
Long Island Jewish straddles the border with Nassau County, hence its name. If the center's residents were not required to spend much of their time at Queens Hospital, then Long Island Jewish, with its courtyards and brand-new birthing rooms, would provide what today's doctors say they are looking for.
For the last five years, Dr. Match said, Long Island Jewish has had trouble filling its internal medicine residency, one of the most critical of the 24 residencies at Queens Hospital.
 
'Queens Track' Fills Gap
 Long Island Jewish sent questionnaires to medical students who took jobs elsewhere. Those questionnaires show, Dr. Match said, that the requirement that 40 percent of a resident's first year be spent at Queens Hospital was a major reason why the young doctors rejected the program.
In response, Long Island Jewish created what it calls the Queens track for its internal medicine residents three years ago. The regular Long Island Jewish residents in internal medicine now spend much less time at Queens. During the first year of residency, , the rotation at Queens Hospital has been reduced to two months from five months.
To fill the gaps left by this reduction, Long Island Jewish hired 30 residents in internal medicine who work only at Queens Hospital. Most, Dr. Match said, are graduates of foreign medical schools, "some of whom are very good, some of whom are not."
Mrs. Jones said Queens Hospital was willing to accept the "Queens track." Although these doctors require closer supervision, she said, at least they are available. One reason Long Island Jewish ended its contract with Queens, however, was a concern that the dual system might be rejected by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, which accredits residency programs. The council is scheduled to review the program early next year.
Without the dual program, Dr. Match said, Long Island Jewish would be unable to offer an internal medicine residency at either hospital.
 
The Choices
Losing a Partner Or Accreditation
 He says he is equally concerned that the Long Island Jewish orthopedic residency will lose its accreditation. Queens Hospital has applied for and been denied designation as a Level One trauma center. Such trauma centers receive the most serious injury cases, exactly the type Dr. Corso and his colleagues need to see to be certified as orthopedic surgeons.
"These are the kind of patients you want to get comfortable with because if you can handle that you can handle anything," said Dr. Corso, who is 32 years old and in the last year of his five-year residency.
Throughout Dr. Corso's residency, ambulances carrying severe trauma cases have bypassed Queens Hospital for Jamaica or Elmhurst hospitals, both of which are designated as Level One trauma centers. "In my entire time at Queens I never saw a multiple injury patient," he said.
In September, Dr. Richard Lasking, then chairman of the Long Island Jewish orthopedics department, wrote to Dr. Match predicting that the orthopedics program would be "in jeopardy" when it is reviewed next year. A short time later, Dr. Match said, he learned to his relief that Jamaica Hospital, which is private, was planning to begin an orthopedics residency program.
A result was a plan by Long Island Jewish to transfer all orthopedics patients from Queens Hospital to Elmhurst, a public hospital with extra beds. Long Island Jewish residents would then go to Jamaica Hospital, which has a trauma center. Queens Hospital would lose its orthopedics residents, but the Long Island Jewish program would be stronger.
When the Health and Hospitals Corporation was informed, they filed suit in State Supreme Court in Queens to halt the departure of the orthopedics residents from Queens Hospital.
The court ruled that Long Island Jewish's contract with the corporation forbid the orthopedics residents to leave Queens Hospital. After many meetings between the two hospitals, a compromise was reached. Long Island Jewish residents now rotate through Long Island Jewish, Queens Hospital and Jamaica Hospital.
 
Hospital's Survival Pledged
 In the month he has spent at Jamaica, Dr. Corso said he has "finally seen quite a few" multiple injury patients.
The corporation has said it will help Queens Hospital reapply for designation as a trauma center. The H.H.C. has not decided exactly how it will give Queens Hospital the doctors it needs, but it will not allow the hospital to close, said Steven J. Matthews, a spokesman for the corporation. Among the options, he said, are to eliminate the residency program and hire only senior doctors, or to create a private corporation to run the residency program at Queens.
Despite this angry prologue, the decision by Long Island Jewish not to renew its contract shocked officials at Queens Hospital and the corporation. Dr. Dumpson called it "self-serving" and "an abandonment of its commitment to the poor."
Dr. Match responded: "We're not abandoning anybody. What we're saying is we can no longer meet our responsibilities under the contract."

HEADLINE: 471 Feared Dead as Red Sea Ferry Sinks

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CAIRO, Dec. 15

 BODY:
A ferry carrying 649 people sank in the Red Sea after it was swept up by 10-foot waves and thrown against a reef, the police said today. As many as 471 people, many returning from a religious pilgrimage, were believed to have drowned.
Egypt's director of port security, Hassan al-Aghouri, said 178 people, some of whom spent nearly 12 hours in shark-infested waters, had been rescued by nightfall from off the port of Safaga. Two United States helicopters that were in the region as part of a force maintaining an economic embargo against Iraq joined in the rescue effort. 
 The deputy director of port security, Brig. Abdel-Karim el-Gazzar, said that all but 10 of the passengers were Egyptians, and that most had been returning from visits to Muslim holy places in Saudi Arabia when the ferry sank about midnight Saturday six miles off Safaga, which is 293 miles southeast of Cairo.
He said the foreign passengers were six Filipinos, two Malaysians, one Zairian and one Sudanese. Another Sudanese was in the 71-member crew, he said.
 
Owned by Egyptian Company
 Mr. Aghouri identified the ferry as the Egyptian-registered Salem Express, owned by the Egyptian Samatour Shipping Company, based in Alexandria.
The 1,105-ton ship was sailing from Jidda, Saudi Arabia, to Safaga when it was tossed about by 10-foot waves whipped by 40-mile-an-hour winds. The vessel rammed coral reefs near the Egyptian harbor and went down immediately, Mr. Aghouri said.
He said rescue teams had been unable to reach the area until dawn today because of heavy storms and high seas.
Relief crews set up tents in Safaga as reception centers for survivors, most of whom were brought in by military helicopter. Brigadier Gazzar said 118 of the survivors were hospitalized.
The American and Australian navies sent helicopters to help Egyptian sailors in the search-and-rescue operation.
 
No Distress Signal Heard
 Lieut. Rob Raine, a Navy spokesman, said American warships had not picked up a distress signal from the Salem Express, which indicated that the crew had not used the correct emergency channel or that the ferry had been out of the ships' radio range.
Some survivors said crewmembers had abandoned ship without doing enough to help. One passenger, Abdel-Aati Hassan, said crewmembers had told people to move to one side of the listing ferry to keep it afloat, then abandoned ship.
"They wore life preservers and left us and even pushed us aside to escape," Mr. Hassan said from his bed at Safaga Central Hospital. "They left us with women and kids, who died."
Brigadier Gazzar said 292 of the ferry's passengers were Egyptians returning home from performing umrah, a pilgrimage for Muslims visiting the holy city of Mecca outside the regular pilgrimage season.
The other Egyptian passengers were workers in Saudi Arabia, coming home either for a holiday because their contracts had ended or because they were being deported by the Saudis, he said.
The trip between Jidda and Safaga takes about 36 hours.
The sinking was the second major boat accident on Egypt's Red Sea coast this year. In April, 24 people died when an overloaded motor launch sank at Hurghada, north of Safaga.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
A Forum That All but Invites the Usual Responses

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
After years of critics' laments about the sound bites that dominate a political campaign, last night's gathering of six Democrats who want to be President turned out to be more of the same.
The format compelled it. Ninety minutes for six men to talk about all manner of problems, one minute at a time, is not an invitation to reflection. What it does invite are phrases that seem to have worked before. 
 Tom Brokaw, presiding for NBC, attempted to press a point now and then only to find that the rules made evasion easy. He told Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa that NBC had added up the cost of social programs he was proposing and found that it came to several times more than the savings he was recommending. Figures were bandied about but Mr. Brokaw had to turn to another candidate and another subject. What was a viewer to make of it?
Seated at an oval table like blue-suited preppies at a seminar, the candidates offered a chorus of concern for the middle-class. There were differences -- one or two favored a tax cut, one or two did not -- but the main effort of each of these non-household names was to establish a television persona.
So viewers heard more than once from Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska that he had been wounded in Vietnam. Gov. Douglas L. Wilder called their attention to the fact that he is black. Senator Harkin let it be known that his mother was an immigrant. He also produced a $1 bill from an inside pocket to make a point about the inadequacy of a tax cut. Somebody must have told him that would fly on television.
Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas seemed to be positioning himself a bit to the right of the group, but it was Paul E. Tsongas, a former senator from Massachusetts, who seemed to have his mind most focused on the issues. The camera played favorites, however, and Mr. Tsongas was not a natural.
In any gathering there has to be one group jester. Last night brought Edmund G. Brown Jr., a former governor of California. He attacked the "context of illusions," and charged that that his fellow Democrats were all in thrall to wealthy contributors. "Are you saying I'm bought and paid for?" Senator Kerrey demanded in the most dramatic encounter of the evening, which is a comment on the general quality of the debate. Mr. Brown politely avoided saying yes. And despite the injunction of Mr. Brokaw he twice announced the 800 number to which viewers could call in their modest contributions.
With six more debates to come, there is hope for something more solid, but that would mean more time on an issue. For example, Senator Kerrey alluded repeatedly to his health plan. That is surely worth a third of a 90-minute program. And so were most of the other issues raced through, from economic growth to relations with the Soviet Union to affirmative action and even Mr. Brown's favorite subject of campaign contributions.
Among the questions that can be skipped areones like why are you running and who will your vice president be? And not allowing a final word would save time and spare the viewer. Gov. Clinton said he wanted to be "an agent of change." Senator Kerrey said "as one who fought in the war in Vietnam . . ." Gov. Wilder told of being "huddled with my buddies in Korea."
The debates have begun. Maybe now they can get serious.

HEADLINE: Dual Role Is Planned for Bush's New Chief of Staff

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
White House workers anxious about the arrival of a new chief of staff on Monday received a discomfiting holiday greeting last week: a memorandum from the Office of Personnel Management outlining the proper procedure for resigning one's job.
In fact, Samuel K. Skinner, who succeeds the departing John H. Sununu, has taken pains to allay fears that he plans any White House bloodletting, and personnel officials hastily insisted that the memorandum had been sent in error. 
 As Mr. Sununu's tenure nears its end, Mr. Skinner seems unlikely to salvage much more of its legacy than the employees and the furniture -- most of it, that is, because Mr. Sununu is taking his Cabinet chair with him.
Instead, he seems likely to set about remaking his predecessor's hobbled domestic-policy operations and meshing them with the President's re-election effort. Mr. Sununu aspired to that dual role, but it was denied him by the President's political aides and by public opinion.
In interviews over the last week, White House officials and others who are following the transition offered more specific ideas of what Mr. Skinner is likely to do over the next few months. They said that his most urgent priority was to work out a clear picture of White House plans for the economy. In that regard, President Bush's own statements have been contradictory and he has been attacked on the subject by Democratic Presidential aspirants as well as by business interests.
The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Skinner planned to use his command of Mr. Bush's office and travel schedules to expose him to experts who are neither politicians nor Washington consultants.
Mr. Skinner also will draw upon a close relationship with officials in the President's campaign organization to coordinate White House policy decisions with campaign strategy.
Mr. Skinner's status as a coordinator of domestic and political strategy raises new questions about the future duties of other top White House advisers, especially two senior aides: Richard G. Darman, the budget director, and Roger Porter, chief of the domestic-policy staff.
Officials said Mr. Darman's influence on domestic policy had expanded in recent months as Mr. Sununu's difficulties mounted. While Mr. Darman is widely regarded as a fiscal mastermind, he has few political credentials to guarantee him similar influence over domestic policy in the campaign.
Mr. Porter's office, which is central to the domestic policy-making process, is regarded by some officials as a natural target for a shakeup once Mr. Skinner is settled into his job.
But Mr. Skinner, who has not spoken on the subject, appears unlikely to make sweeping changes in Mr. Sununu's staff if only because an infusion of new and unschooled aides could hamper the ability to make quick and adept decisions in the heat of a campaign.
 
Thawing Out Relationships
 "The staff was not a problem," one official said. "The action-forcing event that got Sununu out was the campaign, which had been frozen for months" because of the corrosive relationship between Mr. Bush's political strategists and Mr. Sununu.
Since being named on Dec. 3 to succeed Mr. Sununu, Mr. Skinner has remained largely in the background and has said little in public about his plans. He has frequently talked in private with Mr. Bush's two chief re-election officials, Frederic V. Malek and Robert M. Teeter, while having informal chats with White House staff members about office operations.
Mr. Skinner is a longtime friend of Mr. Teeter, a Detroit poll taker and political strategist who was an architect of the electoral triumphs of Mr. Bush and his predecessor, Ronald Reagan. Mr. Skinner helped run Mr. Bush's primary campaign in Illinois in 1980 and managed his primary and general election campaigns there in 1988. Re-election strategists say they expect to make most significant decisions in concert with him, officials said.
Mr. Skinner's role is further elevated, one official said, because Mr. Bush's re-election staff is not run by a single person who makes most campaign decisions, as James A. Baker 3d did in Mr. Bush's 1988 race.
"For an incumbent President, the chief of staff's role is always going to be important in a campaign," the official said. "You can have someone in charge of fund raising and logistics and the rest, but for the campaign, two things are really important: Where does Bush go, and what does he say? And the chief of staff almost invariably controls those two questions."
Inside the White House, Mr. Skinner so far has kept a low profile out of deference to Mr. Sununu and also because he hopes to avoid the disruptions that major personnel shifts might cause, officials said.
In an interview last week, Mr. Skinner said he planned to adjust the White House staff and not to rebuild it from scratch. "Obviously, I'll bring in some" new staff members, he said, but "a lot of good work has been done in the White House. This is an opportunity to tune the organization and hunker down for what's going to be a very tough campaign."
 
Getting Another Opinion
 Mr. Skinner nevertheless plans an unusual review of White House operations and staffing by an outsider that could lead to far-reaching changes. It will be conducted by a New York businessman and old friend, Eugene R. Croisant, who has helped Mr. Skinner to hire staff members and to organize offices in Illinois state government and at the Transportation Department.
Mr. Croisant, an executive vice president at RJR Nabisco Holdings Corporation, will take a two-month leave from his job on Monday. Officials said he carried a mandate to make recommendations about White House operations, including paper flow, the lines of decision-making authority and the abilities and effectiveness of the people who make decisions.
An Administration official said Mr. Croisant (usually pronounced KROY-sant) would look into management issues like "spans of control, the information flow between units in the White House, bottlenecks and voids -- what's dropping through the cracks." It is not clear how deeply involved he will become in hiring and firing at the White House, where all jobs are political and where friendships and loyalty are, if anything, more of an ingredient for success than in private business.
"The goal here is not to replace people, but to get the place functioning efficiently," one official said. "When you replace people, you lose continuity; you lose time because people have to come back up the learning curve."
Nevertheless, that official said, "Sam is the kind of guy who, if he senses a weakness in any of the staff areas, will move on it. So there might be some changes."

HEADLINE: Varied Issues Delay U.S. Nominees' Confirmation

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
When the Senate adjourned last month until January, more than 150 of President Bush's nominees to various executive and judiciary positions were still awaiting confirmation, and an impatient White House complained about the slow pace of the confirmation process.
Some of the delays are merely logistical: it can take up to six weeks just to conduct the required background checks for a nominee. But some nominations, especially to judicial, foreign and economic positions, become entangled in ideological feuds or policy debates that can drag on for months. 
 Among the appointments causing the most difficulty are those to the judiciary. Distracted by the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court this fall, the Senate Judiciary Committee had 54 nominations to consider in the fall session, only 17 of which it voted on.
 
Bush Urged Speedup
 About 50 of the 150 nominees pending have been approved by the Senate Judiciary and other committees and are awaiting a vote by the full Senate.
After the Thomas hearings, Mr. Bush urged a speedup in the confirmation process, complaining that the Senate was crippling his Administration by holding up the confirmation of several important nominees. A White House spokeswoman, Judy Smith, declined to comment on any specific vacancies.
In a speech to Federal employees in October, Mr. Bush recommended that the time between a nomination and confirmation be shortened to six weeks, from a current average of 12 weeks.
But a Senate Foreign Relations Committee aide said the average time between a nomination to the committee and a Senate vote was 60 days, 30 of which were taken up by investigations and getting the nominee to fill out the necessary papers.
 
'Usually a Reason' for Delay
 Senator Claiborne Pell, the Rhode Island Democrat who heads the Foreign Relations Committee, said that on average it took much longer than 30 days for a nomination to be processed through the executive branch.
"The Committee generally acts quickly to approve nominations, and when it does not there is usually a reason," he said. "Sometimes documents are slow in arriving from the executive branch, and when they get here are incomplete. Sometimes senators want assurances on a policy point in dispute."
Political concerns delayed several nominations to prominent posts that were vacant for months. The Administration, for instance, submitted the nomination of William C. Harrop as Ambassador to Israel to the Foreign Relations Committee on July 31, and he was not confirmed by the full Senate until Nov. 20.
In this case, however, it was the Administration that sought the delay. Committee staff members said Mr. Harrop's confirmation was held up because the State Department feared that the hearings, which coincided with the Senate's debate in September on the issue of housing loan guarantees for Israel, would become a forum for debating Israel's refusal to curtail settlements in territories it has occupied since the 1967 Mideast war.
 
White House Blamed for Delays
 Some members of Congress complain that the Administration itself has delayed sending nominations to Capitol Hill, largely for bureaucratic reasons. They point to the case of Susan M. Phillips, a governor of the Federal Reserve Board, whose name the White House sent to the Senate on Sept. 27, nine months after the departure of the governor she replaced.
Because of the Senate's procedures, a single Senator can stall a nomination. In September, Senator Alan Cranston, Democrat of California, put the brakes on two top State Department nominations until the department agreed to make public classified diplomatic cables on April Glaspie, the former United States Ambassador to Iraq.
The two nominees, Edward P. Djerejian as Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, and Thomas M. T. Niles as Assistant Secretary of State for European and Canadian Affairs, were confirmed only after a compromise had been reached for Ms. Glaspie to testify before the committee in mid-November, Mr. Djerejian on Sept. 25 and Mr. Niles on Oct. 1.
While the White House has complained that large numbers of judicial vacancies were slowing down the courts, some Senators countered that the Administration had not nominated judges expeditiously. A Senate Judiciary staff member said the Administration had submitted only 36 nominees by August, one of whom was Justice Thomas, for more than 100 positions that had been vacant since last year.
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Delaware Democrat who heads the Judiciary Committee, complained at a Nov. 21 hearing: "We are at a point where every Federal judge, every law person in this country is talking about the need to expedite the administration of justice. The administration of justice is bogging down because of the White House."
One of the areas most affected is the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York, which serves Manhattan, the Bronx and Westchester County. Seven of the 27 judgeships in this district are vacant. Three of the seven vacancies have not been filled for more than 18 months and for two of these there are no nominees.
 
Tremendous Burden
 "This has been tremendously burdensome," said Charles L. Brieant, the Chief Judge of the Southern District.
In the aftermath of the hearings on Justice Thomas, Mr. Bush met with Senate leaders of both parties to talk about speeding up the process, and a Senate task force was formed to study improvements.
Senator Wendell H. Ford, the Kentucky Democrat who is chairman of the Rules Committee and who will head the task force, said most of the problems with the process result from the failure of Mr. Bush and the Senate to cooperate on nominees. "Hopefully, we will return to a process that focuses on filling positions with competent individuals of unquestioned fitness to serve," Mr. Ford said.

News or Post: Which Will Fail First?

BYLINE: By ALEX S. JONES

 BODY:
Can The Daily News emerge from bankruptcy and survive? And if The News does survive, can The New York Post continue to publish?
Experts in the newspaper industry seem all but unanimous: the answer to each question is probably no. 
 Bear in mind that the experts have been predicting the death of The Daily News for a decade, and that The Post has topped the most-likely-newspaper-to-die list since the 1930's. The will to live at both papers is stunning.
But also remember that in the last year the second-ranked newspapers in Dallas; San Diego; Little Rock, Ark.; Knoxville, Tenn.; Charleston, S.C., and Richmond, Roanoke and Newport News Va., announced that they would cease publication.
 
Waiting on The News
 Clearly, it can happen, despite the defiant faith among News and Post employees that they, surely, could not have come so far and endured so much only to falter now.
Everything seems to depend upon The Daily News, which sought bankruptcy protection from its creditors 10 days ago as the Maxwell empire went into free fall. If The News ceases publication, The Post would probably thrive, at least for a time.
But The Post's owner, Peter S. Kalikow, filed for personal bankruptcy in August. While he says he will start a Sunday paper if The Daily News closes, anything he does will be subject to review by his bankers.
Should The Daily News find a savior who would invest in new presses, a lot of The Post's advertising could gravitate to The News, and The Post could slip into unprofitability, which would mean its death.
A third possibility is that both The Daily News and The Post could continue to plod precariously along on the edge of insolvency. So far, their existence has kept New York Newsday from making a profit, although Newsday, the Long Island parent newspaper, is profitable.
Maintaining the current status quo, however, seems unlikely. The Daily News is without question on the critical list.
"The News is probably a dead duck," said John Morton, a newspaper analyst at the brokerage firm of Lynch, Jones & Ryan in Washington. He views New York City as an aberration in that it has four daily papers, including The New York Times. No other American city has more than two dailies, and most have one.
Still, The Daily News has some reason for hope.
Since Robert Maxwell bought the paper in March, ending a long strike, The Daily News has demonstrated that it commands a loyalty among its readers, who have returned to the paper by the hundreds of thousands.
Advertisers want The Daily News to carry on because tabloid competition keeps ad rates low. New York Newsday has already declared it will immediately raise its ad rates if The News goes under. So advertisers have an incentive to help keep The News alive.
The Daily News seems to be within striking range of bringing its day-to-day revenues and expenses into balance, a move that will buy some time to make the big cost cuts needed if the paper is to become significantly profitable, and hence able to attract an investor who will buy new presses and give the paper a secure future.
James M. Lewis, an expert in bankruptcy law at McGuire, Woods, Battle & Boothe in Washington, said large businesses like The Daily News had a better chance of emerging from Chapter 11 bankruptcy than smaller companies. And bankruptcy gives The News advantages, including the ability to walk away from real estate and equipment lease, thus cutting costs significantly.
The Daily News is also a commodity that immediately makes its owner famous and powerful; that the owner is already rich goes without saying. Few acquisitions offer so much in prestige and instant celebrity, which could tip the balance in a buyer's mind, providing the paper's business prospects are at least mediocre.
Finally, and probably most importantly, it is life or death for The Daily News. The interests of both management and labor lie in doing whatever is necessary to keep it alive.
But there is also a negative side to the argument.
The Daily News is trying to rescue itself in the middle of a recession and a terrible environment for newspaper advertising in New York. In addition, January and February are usually poor months for newspaper advertising and promise to be worse than usual this year.
Even if The Daily News's advertisers remain loyal and buy ads, the paper may have trouble getting paid because it is in bankruptcy.
This means that the paper's revenues may dip well below what is projected, creating even more pressure to cut costs.
While The Daily News's union leaders have said that they will do whatever is necessary to save the paper, they have also said they think unions have sacrificed enough already.
Kevin Maxwell, the paper's publisher, has said The Daily News would have to earn about $40 million in annual profit to justify the $150 million for capital improvements he says are needed to save it. Assuming the paper is losing money at an annual rate of $25 million, which is probably conservative, this means $65 million in cost reductions.
Would the paper's unions make the radical concessions that such cuts would require, even in exchange for an equity stake in the paper?
While logic might say that saving some jobs, perhaps at reduced pay, is better than having no jobs at no pay, it is not that simple.
When the unions agreed in March to reduce the paper's work force by 800 jobs so that Robert Maxwell would buy The Daily News, there was $30 million available for buyouts. The News has no such pot of cash now, and it is difficult to imagine unions agreeing to waive severance.
In addition, a new owner of The Daily News could easily want changes in work rules that would be so contrary to the world the unions have known that they might rather see the paper die.
And finally, the sinking Maxwell empire in Britain may suck The Daily News under, no matter what efforts are made to save it.

HEADLINE: Consumer Optimism Improves a Bit

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Consumer spirits, which tumbled to recession levels in November, did not slip further in December and may even have improved marginally, according to the University of Michigan Survey of Consumer Sentiment.
"The consumer is pretty depressed but not yet catatonic," Robert A. Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities, said Friday after the survey was released. 
 Taken together with other data released Friday on retail sales and jobless claims, the report, which is preliminary and was released only to subscribers, portrayed the economy as stalled but not falling off a cliff.
"The November collapse in confidence was exaggerated," said Roger Brinner, chief economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill.
 
Return to the February Level
 The University of Michigan's index edged up to 70.4 this month, from its November level of 69.1, subscribers to the survey said.
The December level, based on responses collected in the first half of the month, is the same as February's, when confidence had started to move up from its low after the August 1990 invasion of Kuwait. In October of last year, two months after the invasion, the index stood at 63.9.
The monthly University of Michigan survey, widely watched, is included in the Commerce Department's monthly index of leading indicators.
In the most recent polling, consumers were marginally less pessimistic about the current and future conditions of their personal finances, as well as about the economy. But they were also slightly less inclined than in November to think that now was a good time to splurge on expensive items like appliances or cars; this subindex on buying conditions edged down to 118, from 119 in November.
Economists and investors track the confidence measure closely for clues to consumer spending. Adrian Throop, an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco who has studied how well the University of Michigan tracks actual buying, says the survey is a fairly good guide to current spending on big-ticket items like appliances, as well as to future home buying.
Consumer sentiment has swung wildly in the last year, turning euphoric immediately after the American victory in the Persian Gulf, bobbling in a narrow range from April to September and plunging in October and November.
Consumers remain gloomy about job prospects. Nearly half expect unemployment to head higher in the next 12 months, and almost as many expect it to stay the same.
"People are seeing jobs eliminated that they don't think will come back," Mr. Brusca said. "They feel more risk, so they are saving more and spending less."
On the other hand, the survey shows that consumers are attuned to good news on interest rates and inflation.
For the fifth consecutive month, the majority of consumers said interest rates would fall further. And they expected prices to rise just 4 percent in the next year, not the 4.6 percent they had predicted a month earlier.
While economists and investors could draw comfort, if slight, from the survey, the same cannot be said for the White House or Congress. Only a handful of consumers, 4 percent of those surveyed, approved of the way Washington was handling economic matters -- the worst showing since the depths of the 1981-82 recession.

HEADLINE: SOVIET DISARRAY;
U.S. Fears Spread of Soviet Nuclear Weapons

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
With the leadership of the Soviet military in doubt, American planning is increasingly focused on preventing the spread of Soviet nuclear weapons or expertise to the Middle East, North Korea or other developing nations that want atomic weapons, Administration officials said today.
"We've watched the situation very carefully and very closely, and up till now we've been convinced that the Soviets have been able to retain control over their systems," Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said in an interview on the NBC News program "Meet the Press." 
 But both Mr. Cheney and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger said the breakdown of the Soviet Union raises genuine concern that countries like North Korea or Iraq might be able to acquire Soviet nuclear weapons or that scientists with expertise in assembling such weapons might sell their services to other countries. It is not clear how many such experts there are.
"Given the breakup of the Soviet Union, given the disintegration of their society, given the sad state of their economy, the only realistic thing for me to do as Secretary of Defense is to anticipate that one of the byproducts of the breakup of the Soviet Union will be a proliferation of nuclear capability," Mr. Cheney said.
 
Little Margin for Error
 He added, "If the Soviets do an excellent job at retaining control over their stockpile of nuclear weapons -- let's assume they've got 25,000 to 30,000; that's a ballpark figure -- and they are 99 percent successful, that would mean you could still have as many as 250 that they were not able to control."
Administration officials have been saying for some time that the question of who controls the formidable nuclear arsenal once commanded by the Kremlin is a central force behind American policy toward the disintegration of the Soviet Union. Today's comments by Mr. Cheney and Mr. Eagleburger, who appeared on the ABC News program "This Week," provided new details about the Administration's specific concerns and goals.
Mr. Eagleburger said that apart from trying to insure that nuclear weapons remain under a central, unified command and are not seized by individual republics, the United States wants to take advantage of the uncertainty in the Soviet military to get rid of as many of its nuclear weapons as possible.
Congress has authorized the Bush Administration to take $400 million out of the Pentagon budget to help the Soviet Union destroy short-range nuclear weapons.
"We have to move as fast as we can to help them destroy as much of their nuclear stockpile as we can, and we need to do what we can to make sure what is left is not sold on the open market and make sure their technical expertise doesn't migrate," Mr. Eagleburger said.

HEADLINE: OLD ANGOLAN FOES STRUGGLE TO UNITE

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LUBANGO, Angola

 BODY:
After battling for half his life against guerrilla rebels in Angola's civil war, Alindo Ferreira has joined forces with his longtime enemies to help restore peace to this southwest African nation.
"We are all Angolans, and now have to learn to work together," said the 33-year-old Government army major based in Lubango, capital of a southern province, Huila. 
 Alongside fighters from Jonas Savimbi's insurgent movement, the National Movement for the Total Independence of Angola, known by the Portuguese acronym Unita, Major Ferreira is now preparing for a new fight: to unify the warring factions into a national army.
 
'Two Very Different Groups'
 "The process sounds simple, but it is very complex," said Col. John Longman of Britain, one of a team of British, Portuguese and French advisers assisting the Angolan Government with the formation of the new army. "We are talking about two very different groups, a guerrilla army and a conventional one and the integration of the two."
Under the cease-fire signed on May 31 by President Jose Eduardo dos Santos and Mr. Savimbi, both sides and their weapons must be secured in 45 assembly points scattered throughout the country before the actual unification process can begin.
But the assembly process has dragged behind the schedule drafted in the peace agreement, which also calls for internationally monitored elections to be held next September. The peace accord, ending the 16-year civil war that broke out soon after Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975, called for the demobilization of troops, verified by United Nations observers, by Aug. 1. But so far, only about 65 percent of the estimated forces have been counted in the assembly areas.
 
Food Shortages Cited
 While many people acknowledge the probable inflation of projected figures, they hold acute food shortages at the assembly points largely responsible for the low turnout.
"Now thousands of idle young men without food remain near arms in the assembly points," said Ramiro da Silva, the director of the World Food Program. "Without guaranteed food, they will form banditry groups," he added. Citing "critical" food shortages as threatening the peace process, the United Nations began a $27.3 million emergency appeal in October for the demobilizing troops.
The United States has committed about one-third of this target figure, and has begun to deliver emergency relief supplies in an effort to safeguard the peace. "We want the peace process to succeed with free and multiparty elections held in the country," said Philip Davis, an Air Force captain who is one of six American military officers serving as monitors of the peace agreement. He is administering the delivery of relief supplies.
In a change from the years when Washington supplied covert and open assistance for Mr. Savimbi's South African-aided Unita forces in their fight against Cuban- and Soviet-backed Government troops, the current aid is going to both camps. But in a continued show of support for Unita, Congress has earmarked $30 million to aid its transformation from a military movement into a political party.
But even when supplies are available, they do not always reach the assembly points, many of which are inaccessible by road.
"Our biggest problem is transportation," said Daniel Machado, a United Nations observer stationed in Lubango.
A shortage of vehicles, a ravaged road system, land mines and rain have meant a logistical nightmare.
While delays have set the unification timetable back, many people agree that the peace process does not face a serious risk of collapsing. And Angolans on both sides voice a desire not to return to the fighting, which claimed about half a million lives.
"Our points of view were very different; now they have converged around peace," said Padrino Pilartes, a guerrilla colonel. "No one here is interested in war anymore."

HEADLINE: The Old Increasingly Being Bilked By the People They Must Rely On

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER

 BODY:
Investigators, prosecutors and social service agency officials say there are signs that money and property are being stolen, by trickery and coercion, from America's elderly at a disturbing rate and that a large portion of the crimes are committed not by professional criminals but by neighbors, health aides, household workers and family members.
Financial exploitation of the elderly, they say, is likely to continue growing as the number of older Americans who are most vulnerable to it, the lonely and those in poor health, rises. The recession and drug abuse are cited by law enforcement officials as the major motivation behind the rise in such crimes. 
 "There has been an alarming increase and I am afraid it is fast becoming the crime of the 1990's," said Joanne B. Marlatt, program administrator of adult protection services for Colorado.
 
Parallels to Child Abuse
 Like child abuse, many crimes against the elderly are not reported because the victims are physically or mentally unable to summon help, according to interviews with dozens of police and agency officials in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Florida, Arizona, Colorado, California, Minnesota and Wisconsin.
In addition, the experts say, many cases go unreported because of a reticence on the part of the victims to publicly accuse close relatives, much like the silence that often cloaks child abuse, leaving the elderly people ashamed as well as emotionally traumatized.
And even when the abuser is not a family member, investigators say, victims may remain silent, terrified that others will suspect they are unable to care for themselves and conclude they belong in a nursing home.
There are few statistics on the subject, said Dr. Karl Pillemer, assistant professor of human development and family studies at Cornell University and an authority on abuse of the elderly. And what information exists is widely distrusted by officials, who say they believe that more than 80 percent of such cases never come to light.
"However, we do have compelling evidence there is a dramatic increase in the number of cases being reported and that conditions for the material exploitation of older Americans are expected to keep growing," said Dr. Pillemer, who is the author of "Helping Elderly Victims: The Relativity of Elder Abuse" (Columbia University Press, 1989).
The majority of the nation's 31 million men and women who are 65 or older lead active and independent lives. But it stands to reason that when crimes against the infirm or ill among the elderly are committed by people they trust, it tends to make all in the age group feel less secure.
In one such case, in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a live-in housekeeper "controlled" an 85-year-old man and his blind, bed-ridden wife, 83, and took $500,000 of their cash and property before their children, who lived in another state, became suspicious and went to the police.
In Manchester Township, N.J., a middle-aged nurse's aide confessed that personal money problems had driven her to steal nearly $14,000 over six months from the checking account of an elderly widow. "I can't say why I did this other than to say I was under a great deal of stress," the woman told the police.
There are even cases of the old stealing from the older. In Longmont, Colo., this year, the police charged a 68-year-old man with illegally taking $67,000 from his 85-year-old mother's bank account while she was in the hospital with pneumonia.
Adult children with alcohol or drug problems are among the most likely to be abusers. So are those who were neglected, or who perceive themselves as having been neglected, as children and who feel justified in settling old scores.
"The crimes against some old people by their children and even grandchildren amount to nothing more than a mugging," said Frank Reilly, a retired New York City police officer who now works in Florida as an investigator of abuse of the elderly.
Law enforcement and social agency investigators also say that some debt-ridden family members steal from their aging relatives what they rationalize "is rightfully theirs," fearing that their inheritence might be eaten up by medical or nursing bills.
 
Abuse Out Family
 Another major source of abuse is people who are hired to provide care in the home. By using threats that they will leave, forcing the elderly person into a nursing home, or by driving a wedge between the elderly person and family members, the workers can quickly exert great influence in a household, drain assets and then disappear.
It is common for helpers to be hired at low hourly pay, without background checks for criminal activity, and to be given access to an elderly person's checkbook to pay for household expenses, officials say. In-home care for the elderly by nonprofessionals is a rapidly growing industry almost free of regulation in most states, and laws are difficult to enforce even when they do exist.
In a confidential survey in 1989 of older Canadians, 2.5 percent of those questioned said they had been financially abused by someone they knew, Dr. Pillemer said. That proportion, if applied to the United States, would translate into some 750,000 victims.
But he noted that crime rates typically run much higher in the United States, so the figure should be seen as an estimate of the lowest possible number of cases in this country. He also said it was significant that only one of 25 people in the survey said they had reported the abuse to the police.
As the ranks of the enfeebled old swell, aided by medical advances that extend life, the problem of financial abuse is likely to grow.
 
Large Nest Eggs
 In the last few decades, having the financial means to live independently has become a hallmark of older Americans, millions of whom have uprooted themselves from families and familiar communities since the 1950's to move to retirement havens in Florida, Arizona and elsewhere.
Increasing numbers of these elderly people have substantial bank and investment accounts, supplemented by benefits from Social Security and private pension plans. Many have reaped large profits, in some cases in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, from homes sold during the real estate boom of the last two decades. Those who slip into mental impairment leave such nest eggs easy prey to financial abuse.
Even less secure are people of meager means who live alone behind bolted doors in big cities.
Every metropolitan area has many cases like that of a 79-year-old widow in New York City who was made a virtual prisoner inside her home by a grandson and his girlfriend, both crack addicts, who took her Social Security checks as soon as they arrived.
Rose Herschberg, acting director of the elderly crime victims resource center of the New York City Department of Aging, said the best defense against abuse of the elderly is to educate potential victims and people who are likely to be in a position to help them, including the police, hospital workers and banks, on how to identify and address the threat.
Often, the victims are women living alone, a consequence of the longer lives among American women compared to men. Married women of middle age, on average, will become widowed before turning 70 and will die 15 years later; fewer than 1 of 10 will remarry. The United States Census Bureau has estimated that by 1995, 60 percent of women 75 and older will be living alone.
Loneliness among the elderly population and the fear of becoming a burden on families are thoughts never far from the minds of those who live alone. "Even if they know a care-provider, like a housekeeper or an adult child, is stealing their money, they won't report it because they are completely dependent, psychologically and physically, on that individual," said Fran Shaw, a paralegal investigator for the Broward County state attorney's office in Florida.
Near Asbury Park, N.J., the authorities recently were told that a man was stealing money from his mother, a woman in her 70's who lived alone and who was in the early stages of Alzheimer's disease.
"We investigated and found he had taken more than $60,000 from her," said Steven Cerretani, director of protective services for the elderly in Monmouth County. "But she wouldn't press charges because her son was her only contact with the outside world. She told us she was so lonely she'd pay the devil to visit her."
 
Who Reports Abuse
 When a case of financial abuse is reported, the source of the information is likely to be someone other than the victim: a police officer or ambulance attendant who responds to a call from the victim's residence, a bank teller who notices unusual cash withdrawals from a victim's account, a neighbor who observes strangers at a victim's home, or family members who discover that someone has been looting an elderly person's assets.
A sampling of recent police cases shows the variety of crimes against the elderly.
Near Sacramento, Calif., a 79-year-old widow described by an investigator as "sweet and charming, with some dementia and memory loss" was befriended by a younger man, who ran errands for her. Soon, he had become her "financial adviser" and talked her into giving him power of attorney over her bank accounts and stock. By the time a relative became suspicious, the man had looted the accounts of more than $150,000 and fled with jewelry and other property valued at $80,000.
A 56-year-old Pompano Beach, Fla., man who was the legal guardian for his infirm mother, was accused of pocketing $161,000 he withdrew from her bank account. Kent Neal, who heads the economic crimes unit of the Broward County prosecutor's office, said the man had used the money for a variety of expenses, including rust-proofing his car and paying traffic fines. "But at the same time he wouldn't allow doctors to replace his mother's heart pacemaker," he said.
 
Many Are Hurt
 The mentally incapacitated are not the only ones who get hurt.
In Sun City, Ariz., Ellen Lewis's eyesight was failing. Otherwise the 74-year-old widow was alert and energetic. Her one weakness, she recalled ruefully, was trust.
After her husband's death, Mrs. Lewis needed someone to drive her on errands and to do yard work. Through friends she hired "a bright clean-cut young man" and trusted him to such a degree that after a while she began routinely signing blank checks to be used by him for her household bills.
Instead, the 23-year-old man wrote four-figure sums payable to himself in a deception that was not caught for months. He confessed to the police that he had stolen thousands of dollars and he agreed to make restitution, but the episode undermined Mrs. Lewis's confidence about living alone.
In Swampscott, Mass., north of Boston, Emma Marquis also trusted "a nice young man," and it cost her $180,000, her life savings.
Mrs. Marquis, a widow, was shopping for a safe investment in 1983 when she was introduced to a Salem business leader and financial consultant. "If I had had a son, I would want one like him," Mrs. Marquis, now 79, said in a telephone interview. "He was so handsome and had a silver-tongue personality. Everything he said, you trusted."
Through the consultant, an annuity account was opened in her name with a $60,000 check she wrote. Without her knowledge, however, the man closed the account within days by forging Mrs. Marquis's name and he cashed the reimbursement check issued by the insurance company. A few years later, Mrs. Marquis gave him another $120,000 to deposit in the account.
When the consultant died last year at age 47, there were immediate rumors he had bilked dozens of clients. Mrs. Marquis learned that there was no annuity fund in her name.
Her life savings wiped out, Mrs. Marquis said she faces the future with dread. Her children send her monthly checks, "but I don't like taking things from them," she said. "I don't want to be a burden."

He stole thousands of dollars from her before being caught. (Penny Ann Dolin for The New York Times) (pg. B9)

Cuomo's Task: Painting a Rose-Colored New York

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
NEW York State has 13 times more cows than imprisoned criminals.
In Florida, California, Michigan and 12 other states, a larger proportion of the population is in state prison. Five states, California included, have a higher percentage of welfare recipients. New York is less urbanized than Connecticut, California or Maryland. And more American Indians live in New York than in Wyoming, Colorado and Indiana combined. 
 Mention New York to most people, though, and cows are unlikely to come to mind first. In fact, some people believe that if New York has more cows than imprisoned criminals it is only because so many criminals who ought to be in prison are roaming the streets instead.
Preconceptions and the welter of comparative statistics on spending, taxes, the economy and crime that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo marshals in rebuttal may be overshadowed by other variables, ranging from the state's fragile credit rating -- the third lowest -- to Mr. Cuomo's appealing television presence. But which stereotypes the state evokes instead may be pivotal to the Governor's appeal in a Presidential campaign.
Nobody, not even Mr. Cuomo, refers to goings-on in his home state as the New York "miracle." But do out-of-staters generally view New York as a nightmare, as Vice President Quayle suggests? Or, as Mr. Cuomo maintains, as a microcosm of America, warts and all?
If the nightmare perception prevails, Mr. Cuomo may be placed on the defensive and dismissed as part of a problem that is largely unique to the State of New York and to the city of the same name that has typically defined the state's reputation.
"Nobody wants their state to be like New York," said Roger Ailes, a Republican media consultant.
If the Governor persuasively argues that New York's social and economic problems are shared by most Americans and that New York has done more than most states to resolve them, then he stands a better chance of shifting attention, and blame, to Washington's domestic agenda.
"It would be an excellent defense and a great offense," the Governor said of the strategy he has already begun testing against the Republican White House. "There is no way they can attack New York without admitting their own abject failure."
The Cuomo administration flaunts the fact that only 10 inmates escaped from New York prisons last year -- far below the national average -- and that New York has the highest ratio of correction officers to inmates of any state with more than 40,000 inmates. Some analysts cite that very same ratio, though, as evidence that the state payroll is bloated.
Pointing out, as the Governor does, that New York has grown safer compared to the rest of the nation is also a reminder that the rest of the nation is becoming as unsafe as New York (although the facts may get in the way of Republican efforts to transform Arthur Shawcross, who murdered 10 women upstate following his parole in 1987, into Mr. Cuomo's Willie Horton.)
The economic record, according to Mr. Cuomo: New York's income-tax rate has declined from the nation's highest to 12th highest during his tenure. The average growth rate of taxpayer-supported spending has been lower than the national average; more than two-thirds of general fund spending is for local assistance. Spending on state operations grew slower than the inflation rate. The number of employees paid from tax collections has declined; state debt, swollen by the cost of road and prison construction, is still less per person than in eight other states. Federal debt, meanwhile, increased by virtually every measure -- rising, unlike New York's tax-supported debt, as a percentage of personal income, too.
The annotated record, largely according to Cynthia Green of the Citizens Budget Commission: Yes, New York's income-tax rate and state tax burden have declined, but what about the rise in local taxes caused in part by state welfare, Medicaid and other mandates? The effective income-tax rate -- income-tax revenue divided by total income -- is second only to Oregon's, which has no sales tax. Yes, state revenue increases were half the national average, but they might have been higher without budget gimmicks.
Whose record is it anyway? Republican legislative leaders share responsibility, Ms. Green said, because their priorities varied but their proclivity to spend has not.
Historically, New York has been emblematic of things that some other Americans love to hate. Mr. Cuomo, himself, would set a political precedent as an Italian-American candidate. (His middle name was anglicized to Matthew; his first and last names are often mispronounced. It is KWO-mo, not like the lake or the crooner, and MAH-ree-oh, as in Mark, not Mary). While many urban problems have become more ubiquitous, the state still ranks first in the proportion of violent crime, abortions, Jewish residents, lawyers and other categories that have tended to distinguish it from the rest of the country, the South in particular.
"I would never be running for the Senate from Mississippi," said Geraldine A. Ferraro, who hopes, instead, to run for the Senate from New York next year and who was the last New Yorker on a national ticket, for Vice President in 1984.
None has been nominated for President since 1948. None has captured the Presidency since 1932. Not since then, when America was less urbanized but just as concerned about the economy, has domestic policy been so high on the nation's agenda.

HEADLINE: Making Sense Of Labeling On Products

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SPECTER

 BODY:
Stunned by the growth of products making bold claims for environmental purity -- from "nuclear free" light bulbs and "environmentally safe" socks to botanically correct shampoos -- consumer advocates have begun to insist that trendy words like "recycled" and "biodegradable" have meanings that normal people can understand.
"The marketplace has become as polluted as the landfills," said Emma N. Byrne, director of the New Jersey Office of Consumer Protection, which today will send letters to dozens of companies asking them to prove the claims they make for their products. "How can anyone really be confident that they are getting what they are paying for?"
 
Processors Want Rules, Too
 Consumers throughout the nation have demonstrated their eagerness, even in a recession, to pay more for merchandise that promises to respect the environment, and American companies have flooded store shelves with "green" products in response. Yet, like food labels that once used the words "light," "organic" and "natural" in almost any way a manufacturer wished, few products advertising their commitment to the earth are required to prove what they mean, and few do. 
 "Recycled" paper, for example, rarely means paper from products that have already been used. Most of the time the paper is simply made from industrial scraps. And "recyclable" often means nothing at all, because with enough effort and money, every product can be broken into its component parts, and theoretically, recycled.
Neither the Federal Government nor many states have taken strong action to dissipate the emerging babel in the marketplace. Even the few states -- California, New York, Rhode Island and Indiana -- that have attempted to define consumer labels and enforce their laws have done it so differently that what is biodegradable or recycled in one state may not be so in another. And consumers are not the only group that has been overwhelmed by the conflicting claims.
"What we don't want are 50 different standards our members have to interpret and conform to," said Kathleen Grant, the environmental issues consultant to the National Food Processors Association, which would prefer a set of uniform regulations. "In a national market you can't put different labels on each product in every state. It would cost a fortune and it certainly wouldn't help shoppers much either."
Most people could hardly receive less assistance than they do now, however. For those struggling to choose ecologically sensitive products, a trip to the grocery store might as well be a forced march through the looking glass. According to the Environmental Defense Fund, which has followed the trend closely, more than 10 percent of new packaged goods in the nation carried some environmental claim last year, more than double the figure in 1989.
Are Cedar Fresh Moth Balls -- advertised on the package as "the world's first nontoxic moth ball" -- really safer and better than the others? The product carries a little "Eco-Safe" emblem, along with the words "environment friendly." But are they?
"Maybe they are and maybe not," said Mark Green, Commissioner of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, who has aggressively pursued what he calls "green-collar fraud" on the part of manufacturers who mislead customers with false environmental claims. "It's been left to local officials to define these terms. The Environmental Protection Agency should do it but they don't, and the Federal Trade Commission should enforce the rules. But there are none."
 
Seeking a Common Language
 E.P.A. officials say they are aware of the growing confusion and are eager to reduce it. Although it has no authority to require label changes, the agency and the Federal Trade Commission have held hearings on the issue, and each promises that within a year environmental terms will have more universal meanings. But, in the absence of Federal action, several states, including New York, have moved ahead with their own laws and definitions. Congress and many other states now appear ready to follow.
"We need a common language pretty badly," said Allen Herskowitz of the Natural Resources Defense Council. "But the terms are not exactly like health claims where fat is fat and a calorie is a calorie. Some of these terms have to vary because if a plastic cup is recyclable in California -- and often it is -- but not in Maine, we want consumers to know that. Before you have a single language you have to have a single approach to recycling. And we are very far from that day."
Acknowledging the difficulty of its task, the E.P.A. has proposed fairly broad standard definitions for the words recycled and recyclable -- the two most frequently used and (some would argue) misused environmental terms. It has suggested that the word recycled apply only to products that clearly state the percentage by weight of recycled materials they contain.
 
Educating Consumers
 That would help consumers understand the true significance of any such claim. In most cases, now, if any part of a product is recycled, its manufacturer has every right to slap the label "recycled" on the package. If, for example, a company claims that its paper towels are recycled, that can mean that a small percentage of every roll contains scraps that would in the past have been left on the factory floor. Or it could mean that the product is actually made from paper that has already been used.
"When people see the magic word recycled on their product they think they are buying something that has made from a package they threw out," said Richard Dennison, a senior scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund and a leading critic of the current system. "But usually they aren't. And if you see the word 'recyclable' at the bottom of a coffee cup you have to ask 'where can it be recycled?' It won't do you much good if the answer is half way across the country."
Often it is. Proposed E.P.A. definitions would attempt to make it clear to shoppers that their 'recyclable' merchandise cannot be recycled everywhere. Labels would also include information that would disclose how much of the product is being recycled nationwide.
In New Jersey, Ms. Byrne, the consumer affairs director, recently gave two members of her staff each $100 and sent them to local stores. Her orders were to come back with products that made claims that they were environmentally safe.
"Half of it is noise," she said in a recent interview, shaking her head at a box of "reusable lawn bags," and an "earth friendly" children's school kit. "It doesn't mean a thing. It's not fair to consumers and it's not fair to the many companies that really have tried to do something for the environment."
Today she will send a series of detailed letters to many companies selling products in New Jersey that make ecological claims. If a manufacturer calls its product biodegradable, for example, it will be asked to provide evidence.
 
'Who Sets the Rules?'
 "What will typically happen to this package or product once it is discarded by a consumer?" one letter asks a company that sells "biodegradable" bags. "How long will it take for the package to decompose? Please supply any available test data demonstrating that the package or product has the capability to decompose rapidly (within one year) through natural biological processes."
Each letter ends with a warning that failure to respond within 10 business days could result in legal action.
But many companies fear that they will be forced to comply everywhere with the strictest guidelines passed by any single state -- and that they will end up being forced to drop reasonable claims from labels that could have helped educate consumers.
"We want to be as diligent as we possible can," said Bob Murray, a spokesman for Colgate Palmolive, one of the world's largest consumer products companies. "We take the environmental aspect of our labels very seriously. But the issue of standards is not quite as simple as it seems. Whose approach should we use? Who sets the rules?
"We want it to make sense and we agree conformity is important," Mr. Murray said. "But there are so many possible approaches in so many states, cities, countries even. This is not an issue that will be easy to legislate."

HEADLINE: Industries Hoping for Relief With Tax Breaks

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
From Wall Street to Main Street, business executives are looking for changes in the tax system that will provide relief from the sluggish economy.
Many hope their businesses may be revived by restoration of some tax breaks lost in the 1986 tax reform bill, especially investment tax credits and a reduced capital gains tax. 
 President Bush's top economic advisers told Congress last week that the Administration might favor a tax credit on business investments, although they said no final decisions had been made. The Administration has long favored a lower capital gains tax.
Realtors, insurers, bankers, brokers, manufacturers, airline executives and oil producers are among those seeking changes.
 
Fear of Politics
 A notable exception is the powerful small-business lobby, the National Association of Wholesaler Distributors, which is more or less satisfied with the status quo. The group fears that tax changes would be political and lead to the unraveling of the 1986 tax reform act.
"Our people are feeling the same pain that an awful lot of other people are feeling," said Dirk Van Dongen, the group's president. "But taxes have such a propensity to be politicized that you wind up with a package that caters to constituencies and does nothing for the economy."
He added, "Our wish list is a very simple and direct one: do nothing to harm the underlying foundation of the 1986 Tax Reform Act."
On Wall Street, people believe certain tax breaks are needed to spur the economy, said Edward I. O'Brien, president of the Securities Industry Association, which represents the brokerage houses.
"Wall Street cares about the deficit," Mr. O'Brien said. "However, if you agree that there is a serious problem in moving our economy forward, the expansion of the deficit under certain circumstances is not necessarily the worst thing."
At the top of his wish list, Mr. O'Brien placed expansion of the deductibility of Individual Retirement Accounts, which he said would increase savings and make more money available for investment.
Under the 1986 tax law, millions of middle and upper income workers covered by employer pension plans -- couples with incomes above $50,000 and single individuals with incomes above $35,000 -- were no longer allowed to claim such deductions.
The group also seeks a reduction in the capital gains tax "to help get companies off the ground" and investment tax credits "to generate some jobs and verve in the American economic system." Democrats have opposed a reduction in the tax on the gains from the sale of assets, claiming that it would mainly benefit middle- and upper-income taxpayers.
 
Opinions on Investment Credit
 Investment tax credits, first enacted under President John F. Kennedy in 1961, permit businesses to subtract directly from their tax bills a percentage of the money they invest in plants and machinery. Supporters maintain that credits encourage businesses to expand and generate new jobs; opponents say they reward businesses for investments they would make anyway, help capital-intensive industries more than those that depend largely on labor, and established companies more than start-up companies.
Realtors are encouraged by the prospect of tax relief, despite the testimony Thursday of Mr. Bush's economic advisers that the Administration would oppose a reintroduction of real estate tax breaks. "I'm very optimistic," said Stephen D. Riesler, senior vice president of government affairs of the National Association of Realtors. "All the talk in Washington is that something needs to be done to stimulate the economy."
The realtors have four major proposals, each with significant Congressional support. First, they would like a modification of the passive loss restrictions in the 1986 tax bill, which prevent anyone who owns rental real estate from deducting losses against other types of income. The measure was enacted to prevent tax shelter abuses, but the realtors would like an exception made for those who participate in managing rental properties. Their proposal has 320 sponsors in the House and 50 in the Senate.
The realtors also seek the restoration of a capital gains differential for the sale of existing buildings, allowing first-time buyers of homes to make penalty-free withdrawals from I.R.A.'s or 401k savings plans, and permanent enactment of several provisions that are expiring, including tax credits for low-income people and a 25 percent deduction for self-employed people who pay their own medical insurance.
The insurance brokers, also politically influential, want to be able to amortize the acquisition of intangible assets, like the expirations of insurance policies. Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, has introduced legislation to that effect.
"We support the bill, but we want a retroactive clarification that would confirm that intangible assets have value and can be amortized," said Barbara S. Haugen, director of Federal affairs of the National Association of Insurance Brokers. "His bill is from the date of introduction. If you can show by some reasonable method that a customer-based asset has depreciating value, it should be amortized."
The nation's manufacturers seek long-term changes. Paul R. Huard, the National Association of Manufacturers' vice president for taxation and fiscal policy, said, "If they're going to do taxes at all, in terms of short-term stimulus, they ought to stay away from things that are short-term-conception oriented. Throwing money at the middle class based on the number of kids they have may be fine re-election policy, but I doubt that it's going to do much for the economy, short or long term."
The group's top priority is some kind of targeted investment tax credit to stimulate more business investment in machinery and equipment.
The manufacturers also seek a change in the alternative minimum tax, designed to insure that even those taxpayers with high tax deductions pay some tax. The group seeks either a reduction in the alternative rate, now 21 percent for corporations, or a change in the way it is calculated.
"Our big beef is primarily related to depreciation," Mr. Huard said. "Longer depreciation means higher tax liability, particularly when profits are low or non-existent."
 
Changing the Calculation
 The oil producers want a change in the calculation of the alternative minimum tax. Specifically, they do not want the minimum tax to be based on intangible drilling costs and percentage depletion. The oil producers contend that intangible drilling costs are the costs of finding oil and getting wells to the point where they become productive, while percentage depletion is similar to depreciation in other industries.
Tara Lewis, chief tax specialist of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, said, "There's no rationale for having these ordinary and necessary business expenses subject to a penalty under the alternative minimum tax."
And bankers want incentives for savings. "A broad-based incentive would be very useful -- the kind of thing bankers would be able to advertise," said Henry Ruempler, director of tax and accounting for the American Bankers Association, who added that the association had not advocated any particular incentive.
The bankers also support proposals that would improve the value of real estate, like a reduced capital gains tax and a change in the passive loss rules.
The airlines seek an investment tax credit for airline assets "to lower the cost of purchases to an industry already suffering acute capital shortages," the Air Transport Association of America said in a statement.
The airlines also seek a modification of the alternative minimum tax to eliminate air transportation assets, reductions in the 10 percent ticket tax and the 6.25 percent cargo tax, full deductibility of per diem paid to flight crews while away from home overnight, and inclusion of airline gates, routes and slots as existing intangible assets.

HEADLINE: Terrorism Strains Peru's Reforms

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HUACHO, Peru

 BODY:
A fortress of a factory stands anonymously on the Pan American Highway here. Sawhorses have been erected to block car bombers from parking areas. Guards wearing bulletproof vests and toting shotguns search visitors. A concrete watchtower, dominating a perimeter wall, is equipped with gun slits, a steel trapdoor and a battery-powered radio system.
Inside this top-security installation, lines of nimble-fingered women peel, wash and can asparagus and baby ears of corn. 
 A year ago, terrorists blew up the cannery. That was after 40 of them invaded the owner's home. "My crime," said Julio Favre Carranza, the cannery's owner, "is that I give employment to 1,000 people."
At a time when Peru's President, Alberto K. Fujimori, seeks a sweeping free-market revolution, his main obstacle is terrorism by the radical leftist Shining Path movement. Preferring Mao Zedong to Margaret Thatcher, the terrorists believe the road to revolution is through the destruction of Peru's economy.
American companies, accounting for half of the $1.2 billion in foreign investment in Peru and planning to invest more, have been the targets of several terrorist attacks. After guerrillas killed three people at an oil-drilling site, the Mobil Oil Corporation responded by housing and feeding its own detachment of the Peruvian Army.
A decade of growing terrorism by the Sendero Luminoso, or Shining Path, has led many Peruvian and foreign business executives to list security as their primary problem. In an annual survey, the percentage of Peruvian business leaders identifying terrorism as the nation's top challenge jumped to 45 percent this year from 10 percent in 1990.
In Lima, the nation's capital 80 miles south of here, factories in the industrial zone look like maximum-security prisons -- protected by concertina wire, watchtowers and dog runs. Instead of signs with company logos, there are signs ordering visitors to "Identify Yourself!"
While Peru's economy contracted sharply in the 1980's, the number of security companies registered in Lima surged -- from 64 in 1980 to 323 today.
In world rankings, Peru has had the highest number of "politically inspired" terrorist incidents, according to Pinkerton's Inc., the security and investigation organization based in Van Nuys, Calif.
"Peru has hovered around first or second place for the last few years," Gene Mastrangelo, manager of the risk assessment information service at Pinkerton's, said in a telephone interview. "The reason Peru will remain at No. 1 this year is because Shining Path operates at will virtually all over the country."
 
Freer Business Climate
 The terrorism comes just when an avalanche of decrees is giving business executives the most economic freedom in Peru's 459-year history. Seeking to end monopolies, many of which persist from the Spanish colonial era that ended in the early 19th century, the Government has allowed private-sector competition in the mail and telephone services, the railroads, road and sewer construction, electricity generation, oil and gas production and distribution, education, airport management and the production of fish meal used in animal feed and fertilizer.
Copying programs that proved successful in Chile, Peru's southern neighbor, Peru now allows its citizens to choose between state and private pension funds and between state and private health programs.
In the reversal of a socialist legacy that dates to the 1960's, employers have won greater power to hire and fire workers, landlords have won an end to rent controls, and private companies have won the right to buy, sell and mortgage farmland.
Other Government decrees have deregulated airlines, trucking and long-distance bus routes, simplified registration of small businesses and placed foreign banks on an equal footing with local banks.
 
U.S. Embassy's View
 "The Government of President Alberto Fujimori has adopted orthodox, market-oriented economic policies to an extent previously unknown in Peru," reads a new report by the United States Embassy here.
In Peru's lucrative mining and drilling sectors, decrees have allowed foreign investors to make full and free remittance of profits abroad and have encouraged Peru's three main state mining companies to establish joint ventures with private companies, local or foreign. Bidding openly for Hong Kong flight capital, Peru grants any foreigner a Peruvian passport in return for a five-year, $35,000 deposit in the state-run Banco de la Nacion.
While many Peruvians and foreigners are still trying to digest these radical changes, some pioneers have started exploring investment possibilities. Some flight capital is making the return trip home.
"One billion dollars in Peruvian capital has come back this year; if security was such a problem, it would not have come," the Minister of Labor and Social Promotion, Alfonso de los Heros, said in an interview in Lima.
While he was speaking, the lights went out -- either as the result of a terrorist attack or because of the power rationing that has resulted from past damage to transmission lines.
 
Money From Chile and the U.S.
 Investment in Lima's stock market and in southern agricultural land is reportedly coming from Chile, a country where business executives have learned over the last two decades to live with low levels of terrorism.
Peru's largest trading partner, the United States, had about 100 companies participating in a trade fair in Lima in November, the largest participation in memory.
"Assets are cheap, and inflation is headed down," said an American economist here. Inflation in October and November was 4 percent monthly -- the lowest rate in five years.
In the largest American investment seen here in more than a decade, the Southern Peru Copper Corporation, which is 52 percent owned by Asarco Inc. of New York, has announced that it will invest $300 million in new mining technology at two of its copper mines.
 
Big Investment by Occidental
 In another big new American investment, the Occidental Petroleum Corporation recently signed a contract to invest $60 million over the next four years. Occidental, which produces half of Peru's oil, plans to drill 32 new wells by 1995, double the rate of the last five years.
Mobil is drilling its first exploratory well in the Upper Huallaga Valley, the start of a six-year commitment to invest at least $107 million in exploration. Mobil's activities could grow much larger. "If production equals Mobil's expectations, total investment in the project could reach $1 billion," according to the American Embassy report.
One year ago, the Shining Path attacked Mobil's drilling site, killing three people and damaging about $1 million worth of equipment. This year, Mobil is back, protected by its Peruvian Army detachment.
 
Security First
 Indeed, all discussions of investment projects here inevitably return to hard-eyed assessments of security. In this year's survey by the Confederation of Peruvian Industrialists, half of the 400 respondents said they suspected that terrorist sympathizers had infiltrated their labor force; 47 percent said they had received telephone threats; 19 percent said their companies had endured terrorist attacks, and 4 percent said their companies had been victimized by kidnappers. One percent admitted to paying "revolutionary taxes" -- or extortion -- to guerrilla groups.
"We think it is going to be difficult for the nation to recover, if order is not restored," said Mr. Favre, the cannery owner who organized the confederation's annual conference in September under the slogan "Development and Security."
Dressed in a navy blue blazer and a designer tie on a recent morning, Mr. Favre looked like a typical Latin American company president, except for the loaded 9-millimeter Beretta pistol on his office desk.
The Beretta is the last line of defense in a private security system that eats up 9 percent of his company's operating costs and fills a vacuum left by Peru's crumbling state. At a monthly cost of $50,000, Mr. Favre protects the 11 factories of his Atahuampa Group with 80 armed guards and a 150-man Peruvian Army unit that he feeds and houses. In May, a terrorist attack on an army truck killed four of the soldiers.
"Until 1983, we had one watchman for this complex," Victor Lau Chang, Atahuampa's security director, said of a feed-grain mill where the army detachment is bivouacked. Atahuampa is Peru's third-largest canner of asparagus and the third-largest poultry hatchery.
In a region where most farmers have abandoned their land to avoid paying "revolutionary taxes," Ata huampa's security measures are warranted.
 
A Bulletproof Pickup Truck
 In 1989, a squad of guerrillas invaded Mr. Favre's hilltop residential compound here. Finding the owner absent, they killed a guard dog. Since then, he visits his factories only sporadically, driving in a bulletproof pickup truck equipped with four-wheel drive and wide tires in case a trip across the desert becomes necessary to elude kidnappers.
Last year, the Shining Path guerrillas returned. They stopped a company bus, donned the workers' uniforms and drove into the cannery. Once inside, the guerrillas gave a political harangue and then set off enough dynamite to do $1.5 million in damage.
Mr. Favre swore to rebuild his factory in a month. "The next day, I visited the factory with television stations from Lima and challenged Sendero to build its own factory in one month," Mr. Favre said.
"We worked day and night, and in 33 days, the factory was ready. I went on television again. This time, I asked the nation, 'Where is Sendero's factory?' "

HEADLINE: Market Place;
United Airlines: A Global Power

BYLINE: By Agis Salpukas

 BODY:
BY winning the bidding on Pan American's Latin American routes last week, United Airlines positioned itself as the world's leading international carrier, particularly strong in markets that are expected to grow faster than its domestic routes. There is limited entry for competitors on the routes to Brazil and Argentina because bilateral treaties restrict the market. And with the heavy business travel between those countries and the United States, those routes were money makers even for Pan Am.
"Their economies are well developed, and they have generated a lot of travel over the years," said Dan Kasper, a consultant and expert on international aviation at Harbridge House, a consulting group. "Entry and capacity have also been restricted." 
 While Brazil has taken some steps to increase competition by allowing new carriers to begin service, the two American carriers -- United and American -- will have limited competition from South American carriers for the next two years.
Although Pan Am's other markets, including the North Atlantic, lost heavily and helped drive the airline into bankruptcy, the Latin American division produced revenue of $735.1 million and a profit of $55.9 million in 1989, and revenues of $821.1 million and income of $54.2 million in 1990.
"Given the size of the revenue stream and its past earnings history, United will have very respectable and profitable operations by the end of 1992," predicted Julius Maldutis, the airline analyst for Salomon Brothers.
Kevin Murphy, the airline analyst for Morgan Stanley, said every important international route transfer had worked out well for the winning carriers. And once the recession wanes, United's stock should benefit, he said, adding: "United is now the world's best international airline franchise. No other airline in the world has United's global reach."
American Airlines, eager to expand its service to Latin America on the routes obtained from Eastern Airlines, was willing to bid $130 million just to get more frequent flights to Argentina and Brazil. American was aware that it would have had to dispose of the bulk of what it purchased because of antitrust considerations. American says its flights to Brazil and Argentina are booked solid through March.
In a fierce bidding war, United won the Pan Am routes for $135 million, seemingly a bargain since American paid $342 million for the Eastern routes. United had also offered to buy the routes from Pan Am late in August for $215 million.
"The price was quite cheap," Mr. Maldutis said.
And Mr. Kapser commented: "They wanted to fill out their portfolio. What they have done is re-create the old Pan Am -- which was the largest international carrier -- with United, which before deregulation was the largest domestic carrier.
"United has service to every major continent now," he added. The carrier bought Pan Am's Pacific routes in the mid-80's, an operation that became highly profitable after United stumbled when it first took over the service.
Because Pan Am ceased operations last week, United will in effect begin a new airline when it begins serving the routes on Jan. 15. That day, United plans to begin daily service from Kennedy International Airport in New York to Rio de Janerio, continuing to Buenos Aires, with a Boeing 747; there will also be daily service from Miami to Rio de Janeiro and Sao Paulo with a Boeing 747.
On the same day, United will also begin service from Kennedy to Caracas with a Boeing 757.
United will take delivery next year of 66 new airplanes, including 10 767's, wide-body aircraft that can be used on the routes.
Stephen M. Wolf, the chairman and president of United, said the airline would eventually offer more frequent flights than Pan Am did. "It will obviously take us some period to get up and running, and an additional period to utilize fully the frequencies which we have obtained," he said.
As part of its bid , United said it would offer employment to 1,000 of the 10,000 Pan Am employees who lost their jobs. The "cultural sensitivities and understanding that these individuals possess are of special importance to United," he said.
The problem is that United's unions will have to agree to integrate the new workers. The United Master Executive Council of the pilots union is expected to let in only a small number of the 880 pilots who lost their jobs at Pan Am.

HEADLINE: The Talk of Hollywood;
Critics' Warm Words Dispel Predictions Of Doom for 'Bugsy'

BYLINE: By BERNARD WEINRAUB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HOLLYWOOD, Dec. 15

 BODY:
It is the best of times and the not so best of times for Sony Pictures Entertainment.
On Saturday, the Barry Levinson film "Bugsy" won the Los Angeles Film Critics award as the best movie of the year, a triumph not only for the director but also for the star, Warren Beatty, who plays the gangster Bugsy Siegel. Only weeks ago, the film was brushed aside by many in the film industry who hadn't even seen it. 
 "Here was a picture coming out of nowhere," said one film executive, who spoke only on condition of anonymity. "The exhibitors were especially worried about it. Another gangster movie after some others had failed, with Warren Beatty, whose drawing power is questionable."
For Mr. Beatty and Mr. Levinson, the director of "Rain Man" and "Avalon," the positive critical response to the film, which opened on Friday, coupled with the Los Angeles award, is an especially sweet triumph. The two had complained privately and not so privately that Sony's Tri-Star Pictures, which made the movie, had accorded indifferent promotion treatment to "Bugsy" in favor of the megabucks Steven Spielberg extravaganza, "Hook," about a grown-up Peter Pan who is a workaholic Southern California executive.
Film executives said the studio was obsessed with "Hook" because of its $60 million to $70 million cost, because its stars and director will get a sizable share of the profits, because of a yearning to keep Mr. Spielberg happy and because the director is especially popular among the Japanese. The Sony Corporation, which owns Tri-Star and Columbia Pictures, has taken special pride in "Hook."
The Spielberg adventure, starring Robin Williams, Dustin Hoffman and Julia Roberts, gathered mixed reviews when it opened on Wednesday. In its first weekend, "Hook" proved a bit disappointing to the studio at the box office, although Tri-Star executives insisted that with Christmas approaching the film would build into a major success. It is estimated that "Hook" will bring in $13.5 million to $14 million this weekend, raising the film's gross to a total of $17 million. (In contrast, "The Addams Family" brought in $24 million in its first weekend when it opened on Nov. 22.)
Mike Medavoy, the chairman of Tri-Star, said that the word-of-mouth reaction over the weekend to "Hook" had been very strong and that he was not disappointed. "There's been such an incredible microscope on this movie, in part because of the perceived cost and the deal," he said. "I don't know if people were reviewing the movie or other aspects of it."
Asked about the award from the Los Angeles film critics, Mr. Medavoy responded, "Isn't it great?" The critics voted other awards to "Bugsy," selecting Mr. Levinson as best director and James Toback as best screenwriter. Mercedes Ruehl was named best actress for her role in "The Fisher King" (another Tri-Star movie) and Nick Nolte best actor, for "The Prince of Tides."
Mr. Medavoy said it was unfair to say the studio ignored "Bugsy" because of "Hook." "The press was completely fixated on 'Hook,' " he said. "It's not something I was maneuvering or not maneuvering. The truth is, in some instances I gave 'Bugsy,' more because it required more time and more effort.
"Let's face it: it started out as another gangster movie in a line of gangster movies that hadn't worked. It's become the darling of the critics. I'm a happy camper."
 
Hard Times, Small Movies
 Although the bleak national economic mood has slowly begun to seize Hollywood, with some movie stars cutting back salary demands and talent agencies, including Creative Artists Agency, International Creative Management and William Morris, scaling back their Christmas parties, the town is hardly in the midst of a recession. But the economic troubles facing the nation along with the cost of moviegoing has plainly led to a sharp downturn in movie attendance, making smaller films more vulnerable and competitive.
As a result, movie companies are taking a major risk: releasing relatively low-budget films this month in New York, Los Angeles and other major cities, without the the hype of "Hook," "Bugsy," "J.F.K.," "For the Boys" or "Beauty and the Beast." The strategy, almost Darwinian in nature, is relatively simple: release the smaller films before the end of the year, yearn for positive critical reviews and strong word-of-mouth reaction and hope for an Academy Award nomination or two that will enable the strongest films to survive. And possibly even beat the big guys.
The smaller films this year include "Fried Green Tomatoes," a comedy-drama about a group of rural Alabama women starring Kathy Bates and Jessica Tandy; "Hear My Song," a comic fantasy about an Irish tenor, starring Ned Beatty; "The Inner Circle," a drama starring Tom Hulce, about Stalin's film projectionist, and "Rush," with Jennifer Jason Leigh, about an undercover narcotics officer who becomes an addict herself. Other small films are "Life Is Sweet," a comic film about families and ordinary people by the English film maker Mike Leigh; "Meeting Venus," a comedy-drama starring Glenn Close set against the backdrop of a production of Wagner's "Tannhauser," and "Kafka," the Steven Soderbergh film starring Jeremy Irons in a surreal account of the writer's life in Prague.
"These movies will have to compete by word of mouth," said Tom Pollock, the executive vice president and chairman of the motion picture group at MCA, which is producing "Fried Green Tomatoes." The film cost $10 million to $12 million compared with the $60 million to $70 million spent on "Hook."
"It would be suicide to go head to head with the star power and money power of the big movies," he added. "The upside is that these smaller movies are harder to make and when they work, they're always the best. The audiences say: 'This is new. This is different. This is fresh, and I like it.' The downside is they'll get lost in the bigger-budgeted, bigger-marketed, easily sold movies."
Jon Avnet, producer, director and co-writer of "Fried Green Tomatoes," said: "It's so crowded at Christmas. How do you compete with Barbra Streisand and Kevin Costner and 'Hook.' So much is going on. You hope that your film is good and that people will find it by mid-January when these big films have faded. You hope that people will find it so that idiots like me can do movies like this."
In recent years, smaller movies, like "Driving Miss Daisy," "Chariots of Fire" and "My Left Foot," have unexpectedly emerged from the pack as award winners and moneymakers.
"What gets people into the theater is not the budget of the movie, far from it," said Harvey Weinstein, the president of Miramax Films, which is producing "Kafka," and "Hear My Song." " 'My Left Foot' cost $2.3 million. People don't go to the movies and say, 'I'm going to see this $50 million movie.' It's emotion. It's writing and talent and what a movie has to say. That's what it's about. That's what it's really about."
 
New Year, Small Screen
 Like film producers, television executives are especially nervous this time of year. Networks make decisions on midseason replacements, new series that will appear in February or March. And Harvey Shephard, the president of Warner Brothers Television, an executive who has one of the better track records in the business, awaits the new year with uncertainty, given the nation's sour economic mood, the high costs of television and the enormous risks and potential payoffs of new television shows.
Mr. Shephard, a low-key 54-year-old former economics major at City College of New York, has played an essential role in the development and production of such shows as "Murphy Brown," "China Beach" and "Life Goes On." As a CBS senior vice president in the 1980's, Mr. Shephard helped to develop "Cagney and Lacey," "Murder, She Wrote," and "Kate and Allie."
He acknowledges that the series he plans over the next few months define, in some ways, his perception of what viewers want at this moment, the economic realities of the television business and the mood of the nation.
One new hourlong show, "The Human Target," based on the DC Comics series, is intended not only for large domestic audiences but also for the lucrative foreign market, which can financially make or break a show. This sci-fi series on ABC stars Rick Springfield as an adventurer for hire who disguises himself as the people who need his help.
"Hopefully, it's a formula for all tastes that could have a strong foreign market," Mr. Shephard said. "At this point, the foreign market is the difference between whether you make an hourlong show or not. The only real source of revenue for an expensive hourlong show is foreign TV."
Other new half-hour shows seek to tap into the mood of the audience. One of them, "Room for Two," a comedy on ABC about a mother and daughter, stars Linda Lavin as a widow who moves to New York and starts working on her daughter's morning talk show. "We have two very strong-willed women, and we wanted to explore this relationship, which really hasn't been done on television," said Mr. Shephard, who observed that women outnumber men as television viewers. Shows that successfully appeal to women, like "Murphy Brown," are extraordinarily profitable.
Another new show, "Willy," also for ABC, deals with a young boy whose parents are divorced and who escapes the pressures of his life by creating his own fantasies and movies. The show intends, in part, he said, to tap into the emotional hardships endured by children in split families.
Mr. Shephard, who acknowledged that he had endured his commercial failures too, said what makes a television show successful are what he calls the interpersonal relations of the main characters.
"Standing up for certain principles, how you deal with other people:that's what makes shows like 'Murphy Brown' or 'Life Goes On' all within the best writing, acting and production values," he said.

They Like Their Sound Intense and a Mite Loud

BYLINE: By PETER WATROUS

 BODY:
When the Family Stand's "Moon in Scorpio" (East West) arrived several months ago, it came swollen with audacity. The New York-based band had released an earlier album, working within the smooth and limited confines of black pop, and it had produced portions of Paula Abdul's recent "Spellbound," making dance music with no ramifications beyond having a good time.
But "Moon in Scorpio," for all its hippieisms (one song is called "Chakra Love") and retrograde identifications with the 1960's, sounds new, as if it were the product of an imagination that hadn't been hindered by the racial politics of genre. Mixing rock and soul, the record, one of the better albums of the year, didn't stand a chance of airplay; the band even included a song called "Plantation Radio," which insinuated that race, from radio's perspective, dictated what a musician should play. The song dared radio to ignore the album, which it has. 
 Following in the path of black rock groups from George Clinton's aggregations on down through Living Color, the band contrasted heavy metal guitar riffs and acoustic guitar lines (virtually unknown in black pop) with the lead singer Sandra St. Victor's gospel-influenced lead singing. When combined, the sources shimmered with cultural meaning, and by placing different forms of musical expression together, the forms were revitalized. It was as if the band had completely absorbed its sources and decided that it liked using them unadulterated rather than blended.
And intense. At Wetlands on Friday night, the band, working with three guitars, two keyboards, bass and drums, didn't bother trying to keep within the confines of its recorded songs and played a magnificent set that backed up its growing reputation as a live band. Playing material from "Moon in Scorpio," the band made everything sound as if it had been turned up too loud. With several singers singing at the same time and a mass of guitars tangling up at once, it seemed as if too much boiling water had been poured into too small a cup.
Even though the group moved from the low-volume ballads like "Quiet Desperation" to shouting sessions like "Shades of Blue," the songs trembled under the weight of the onslaught, with Ms. St. Victor improvising snakelike vocal lines while charismatically tossing her braids around. The band's intensity, dirty but lithe, has made it one of the better live bands working, which may explain why, deep in a recession that's crushing club attendance, it has been able to attract packed houses for its regular shows around the city.

HEADLINE: Review/Music;
Debussy, Bach, Part And Strauss In Brooklyn

BYLINE: By EDWARD ROTHSTEIN

 BODY:
The Brooklyn Philharmonic Orchestra, like many other musical institutions in the city, is in transition. Like the New York Philharmonic and the American Symphony Orchestra, it has a new musical director: Dennis Russell Davies, who offered his second concert program as principal conductor on Friday night. And like Lincoln Center and the 92d Street Y, it is also attempting to redefine itself in changing economic and cultural times: Mr. Davies, aside from his conductorial position, has become musical director of the Brooklyn Academy itself.
Precisely what is coming to an end and what is beginning in these changes will only become clear during the next few years. But the appointment of Mr. Davies was a dramatic one. He is also principal conductor of the American Composers Orchestra and of the Cabrillo Music Festival in Aptos, Calif., and even directs the musical life of the city of Bonn. He has demonstrated a devotion to new composition, to various strands of the avant-garde, and has displayed broader tastes and talents as well. He has pledged to expand the loyal subscription audiences to the Brooklyn Philharmonic, to expand the stylistic range of the orchestra, and to create a distinctive voice in a city already crowded with competing cries of originality. His efforts will be crucial for the academy too, as its acclaimed Next Wave programming begins to seem a bit like visions of the last wave. 
 The program on Friday night, though, did not offer too much indication of where Mr. Davies is planning to take the orchestra. There was the United States premiere of one piece by Arvo Part, the Estonian composer who has an almost cultish following for his mystical, contemplative vision and whose music might be expected to draw new listeners. But it was a relatively unimposing seven-minute composition. The rest of the program was familiar enough: Bach's "Brandenburg" Concerto No. 5, Debussy's "Iberia" and Strauss's "Four Last Songs."
But for all its brevity, Mr. Part's "Festina Lente," though, was an attractive adagio from a composer more used to epic expanse. Written for string orchestra (with two harps included in this performance), the work, whose title means "Make Haste Slowly," is constructed out of canonical imitations of a single rocking, wavelike theme; one imitation is played at double tempo, the other at half. The theme is heard seven times.
The piece wore its mysticism lightly, creating an almost gracious ebbing and flowing of melodic motifs. Instead of the highly articulated, muscular transparency we associate with Bach's canons and fugues, Mr. Part's legato strings created a misty accumulation of echoes and repetitions, with no edges to disrupt the swirl of sound. Mr. Davies conducted with conviction and concentration, repeating the work much to the audience's pleasure.
Elsewhere the results were more qualified. Strauss's "Four Last Songs," for example, lacked the differentiation of timbre and volume they should have had. The soprano Roberta Alexander, like the orchestra, seemed to sacrifice articulation and variation for the sake of a seamless legato. This was as true of the words -- the German text was often lost in sounds that resembled mere vocalization -- as of musical nuances. Yet the performance, oddly monochromatic, was also effectively melancholic, with Ms. Alexander producing rhapsodically controlled lines.
The Bach and Debussy performances had less to recommend them. In Bach's "Brandenburg" Concerto No. 5, with Mr. Davies conducting nine players from the harpsichord, the playing was overly inelastic and emphatic. Mr. Davies's tapping feet during the cadenza was just one sign of attention to downbeat rather than to tensile development. In "Iberia," the second of Debussy's "Images for Orchestra," the Brooklyn players required greater variation in tone color and intensity and Mr. Davies required a slightly more supple sense of dance rhythms.
But as with other institutions, results are now dependent on long-term developments rather than immediate successes. So it will be intriguing to see where Mr. Davies leads the orchestra in coming years, what repertory he chooses, how the orchestra comes to define itself, and where, finally, he begins to lead us, in a changing musical city.

HEADLINE: GOLF;
Hard Times Land On Wealthy Greens

BYLINE: By JAIME DIAZ

 BODY:
The economic downturn is encroaching on the privileged world of the nation's private country clubs, traditionally one of the last places to feel the effects of hard times.
"Normally, country clubs are hardly touched by a recession," said Lewis Goodkin, president of Goodkin Research Corporation, a Fort Lauderdale, Fla., company that analyzes the market trends of private golf developments. "But the white-collar sector hasn't been hit this hard since the Depression. The country club has definitely felt this recession more than any in the past." 
 Patterns vary nationwide. In most states, private clubs are reporting that despite tight times, they are remaining by and large solid, self-sustaining enterprises.
But in other regions, particularly those where golf memberships are tied to real-estate developments, the playgrounds of the well-to-do are experiencing the pinch. To wit:
*In Florida, analysts say that at least a fourth of the state's more than 360 private golf clubs are operating well below capacity because too many high-priced homes that come with membership in the clubs are going unsold.
*In Texas, where the oil crisis and savings and loan crisis hit particularly hard, 50 of the state's 327 private clubs, which were tied to real estate developments and had incurred lavish debts in the prosperous 1980's, were forced into receivership when their lenders collapsed.
*In California, the falling Japanese economy has reduced the price of 1,500 planned memberships for Pebble Beach golf courses from $750,000 apiece to about $150,000. The Japanese businessman who paid more than $800 million for the prestigious Pebble Beach company in 1990 thought that wealthy, golf-starved Japanese would readily ante up exorbitant fees for the privilege of playing there. But then the recession went global. The move to install private memberships at Pebble Beach, which is currently a public facility, is on hold pending approval by the California Coastal Commission.
*In the Northeast, the average waiting time fell from 48 months in 1988 to 28 months in 1990 for New York area clubs, 52 to 31 months in Washington, and 32 to 17 months in Boston, according to a survey in the January issue of Golf Shop Operations.
 
Total Rounds Rising
 Meanwhile, total rounds of golf nationwide continue to go up, as the frequency of public golf in particular is unaffected by the recession. And so far, the country's most exclusive clubs are reporting business as usual, particularly in the New York area, where the high concentration of well-salaried executives, the relative lack of good public golf courses, and some of the finest private golf courses in the world create a demand that remains virtually recession-proof.
But less prestigious private clubs, whose memberships are made up mainly of small businessmen, mid level corporate executives and retirees, are more vulnerable. Most of these clubs are taking in less money than in previous years because fewer members are entertaining and dining out, more are taking leaves of absence or resigning, and fewer are on the waiting list to replace them.
These trends are expected to continue as more corporate executives lose jobs, more companies eliminate country club memberships for their executives, more small businesses fail, and as the cost of living continues to overtake those on fixed incomes.
"It's not just average Joes who can't afford their clubs anymore," said Goodkin, whose company has eliminated jobs that came with country club memberships. "There are plenty of guys who went from making hundreds of thousands of dollars a year to going without. And with so many consolidations going on, a lot of those jobs are never going to be replaced."
 
Shorter Waiting Lists
 Although no comprehensive statistics are available, the most telling indicator is the reduction of waiting lists, which country clubs often use as a barometer of financial health. In a survey completed in September by the Metropolitan Golf Association, which represents about 225 private clubs in the greater New York City area, less than half of the clubs reported having waiting lists. Two years ago, the association found that almost 70 percent of the clubs had waiting lists.
"We've definitely seen waiting lists shrink, except at the very best clubs," said Jay Mottola, executive director of the M.G.A. "Even clubs without the best facilities or courses used to have the luxury of waiting lists. Now that has clearly changed."
Club spokesmen agree that the waiting lists have eroded faster because of the recession.
"People are definitely spending less, and as things get worse, they are resigning," said Robert Dedman, president of Club Corporation of America, which owns or manages some 60 private golf clubs nationwide. "Right now there is not as big a reservoir of people to take their place."
"We've lost some people who own small businesses, people in real estate, people in construction, executives who lost their jobs, or retired people," said John O'Brien, general manager of the Patterson Club in Fairfield, Conn., which has seen its waiting list reduced from eight years in the late 1980's to about three years today.
 
The Country-Club Golfer
 The cost of belonging to a private club has always been prohibitive for all but people of considerable means. Costs in the greater New York area may be somewhat higher than the national average, but a look at M.G.A. members provides an indicative financial profile of country-club golfers. According to Mottola:
*The median household income of country club members in the metropolitan area is $123,700 a year, with more than 81 percent making more than $75,000 a year.
*The average initiation fees for a sample of 90 clubs in the Westchester, Long Island, New Jersey and Connecticut metropolitan area in 1991 was about $17,000, with fees ranging as high as $60,000 at some Long Island clubs.
*Yearly dues at these clubs averaged just over $4,000 a year, with a high of about $12,000.
Under such financial demands, club resignations in the area have increased. At Rolling Hills Country Club in Wilton, Conn., for example, 41 of approximately 220 members resigned last year. The club's president, Harold Silver, said most of those were older members who decided to make Florida or other southern locations their full-time residence, and that only two of the resignations were directly related to failed business income from the recession. Silver said the club has been able to replace nearly all the openings, without any lowering of the initiation fees or dues.
 
Revamping Initiation Fees
 But when member rolls showed similar depletion last year at the Golf Club of Avon, situated near Hartford, the club lowered an initiation fee from $10,500 to $3,500.
"We had more people leave for economic reasons than they did prior to the recession," said William Hackett, president of the club. "The key factor was they weren't being replaced because a lot of people couldn't afford the upfront money."
Hackett said the drive built membership to a desired level of 850, and the club is solvent. Other clubs have taken similar measures, including allowing initiation fees to be paid in installments, but in the time-honored club tradition of privacy, have kept it more to themselves.
"Those kinds of things are usually done quietly and subtly," said one manager, who asked to remain anonymous. "It's all done by word of mouth in a certain closed circle of people. They don't want to advertise, because even though they may need the money, they still want a certain type of person."
 
Substantial Investment
 Indeed, even when finances are strapped, giving up a club membership is a drastic step. It means losing the equity from a usually substantial initiation fee, the regular contact of friends, and the privilege of leisurely, hassle-free golf. Instead, it means joining the teeming hordes who gather for five hour-plus rounds at crowded public courses.
"You have to understand the mentality of someone who has been raised in a club," said Jerry Yacavone, general manager of Brooklawn in Fairfield, Conn. "This is a very important part of their life. I've heard some of our members say they pay their club bill before they pay their their mortgage."
For that reason, most experts believe it unlikely that the economy will force a large exodus from private clubs.
"Certainly disposable income has been affected, but I think memberships are being minimally affected," said James Singerling, executive vice president of the Club Managers Association of America. "Because of the equity they have in the club, people are holding on. They are saying, "I will give up this year's trip to Disneyland or maybe a week in Caymans, but I'm not going to give up the club that I use all year round.' "
 
Members Spending Less
 But active members are spending less money at their clubs. Although tight times often produce increased use at clubs by members who forgo travel and vacations, some 80 percent of the clubs surveyed by the M.G.A. said that the recession has reduced business.
"The majority of clubs have seen some diminution in activity," said Gerard F. Hurley, executive vice president of the National Club Association. "Instead of seeing a member twice a week, clubs maybe are only seeing him twice a month. Or if they see him the same amount, he is spending less. It's led to a dropoff of 15 to 20 percent in gross revenue."
Of course, among the well-heeled in the New York area, there will always be clubs that are exceptions proving the rule. The Atlantic Club, the prestigious new golf club that will open in Bridgehampton, L.I., in May, already has 150 members who have paid $100,000 to $125,000 in initiation fees, and will cut off membership at 160.
"To create a facility like Atlantic Golf Club demands an unusual equity investment," said Lowell Schulman, the developer of the project. "The state of the economy, one would think, would have great impact on that. I'm surprised that it's not the case, but it's just not been the case."
But less wealthy clubs, although by their nature traditionally resilient to economic trends, can no longer say the same.
"Private clubs are lucky to have people that are better off," said Ted Price, president of the Ridgewood Country Club in Paramus, N.J. "And business will hold together as long as they feel better off. But these days, it's getting harder to feel that way."

HEADLINE: Puerto Ricans Tilt to Statehood

 BODY:
Both sides in Puerto Rico have cried foul, and voters there may well have been confused by the complex referendum questions put to them recently. But in a 53-to-45 percent vote, Puerto Ricans rejected what looked like an attempt to load the deck against future statehood. The results were a rebuke to Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon, whose party wants to expand and make permanent the island's present commonwealth status.
The Governor overreached by asking Puerto Ricans to claim constitutional guarantees for their distinct cultural identity, even if their island should become a state. The guarantees would have included the right to field their own international sports teams. But these are rights that only the U.S. Congress and international sports groups can bestow. 
 The election was marred by exaggeration and innuendo. Statehood supporters mounted a scare campaign suggesting that approval could mean the loss of U.S. citizenship and welfare benefits. And commonwealth proponents exploited anger at an aloof and imperious U.S. Congress that failed to deliver on promises to hold a status plebiscite this year. It added to the sting when some stateside senators suggested that Spanish-speakers were somehow unfit for statehood.
For Puerto Ricans, statehood offers the chance for real clout in Washington with two U.S. senators and a flock of representatives. But it leaves linguistic rights unsettled and would also end exemptions from Federal taxes that have fueled economic growth. Those exemptions, and the right of home rule, are the outstanding benefits of the commonwealth status that has been peculiar to Puerto Rico since 1952.
Seen from the mainland, the debate has a reassuring dimension. In a world of rampant ethnic separatism, the choice in Puerto Rico is principally between two forms of association with the United States. Independence has little support, and the referendum now suggests a tilt to statehood. The burden is once again on Congress to assure a meaningful choice for a people seized as war booty in 1898 and treated ever since as a stepchild by Washington.

HEADLINE: Abroad at Home;
Still Little England?

BYLINE: By ANTHONY LEWIS

DATELINE: WILLIAMSBURG, Va.

 BODY:
Suppose that 1 of the 13 original American states had at first stayed out of the constitutional union, then reluctantly joined but repeatedly dragged its feet on great national enterprises. Suppose that state had demanded, and won for itself, exemption from parts of the constitutional system.
That analogy, inexact though it is, gives an idea of Britain's attitude toward the European Community. Standing aloof at first, Britain finally joined -- but continues to act as if membership were a burden, or even a menace, instead of an opportunity to share in one of the most promising ventures in contemporary history. 
 This is a time of hope for the Community. Meeting last week in the Dutch town of Maastricht, the heads of the 12 member governments committed themselves to establishing a common currency and European central bank by no later than seven years from now. They pledged to work for a common foreign policy and perhaps, in time, "a common defense."
In these and other ways the Maastricht meeting took dramatic steps toward what it called "ever closer union." American history demonstrates how making the critical monetary and economic decisions at the center may draw political power there, too -- may make citizens look to federal rather than local institutions for leadership.
And where was Britain as the Community thus made concrete its vision of a united Europe? Prime Minister John Major was in Maastricht -- resisting all the way.
Mr. Major rejected a move to adopt European-wide labor and employment laws. The other 11 members thought that step was a necessary accompaniment to the single European market that becomes a reality next year. When Mr. Major, obdurate, blocked a treaty amendment, the 11 adopted the proposal as a separate agreement among themselves.
And Mr. Major said he would veto the proposal for a common currency and central bank unless Britain were allowed to stay out when the moment of creation comes. The others agreed on an opt-out clause for Britain.
To stay out of the European monetary union would be quite unrealistic for Britain, indeed suicidal. The financial institutions of the City of London, which are so important now in the world of finance, would be relegated to the sidelines.
Germany's Bundesbank is today the dominant influence on monetary policy in all the European countries. Under the proposed monetary union, the Bundesbank's role would be taken over by a central bank in which all member countries would have a part. Britain would have more influence than it does now.
The still larger point is political. The newly reunited Germany is the big player in Europe, and its powerful economy is going to make it ever bigger. At a time when angry nationalism is flaring up in so many places, it is in everyone's urgent interest to knit Germany into a larger Europe. That is the reason that Chancellor Helmut Kohl has been so strong an advocate of strengthening the Community and its political character.
For all those reasons no sensible British Government is going to stand apart in the end. The Community is solidifying, Britain will in time join in that process, and Mr. Major knows it.
Yet at Maastricht Mr. Major played dog in the manger. He forced a solution that creates something like a two-tier Europe, with Britain alone in the second tier. When it was over, he told reporters happily that it had been "game, set and match for Britain." Some game, some match.
Why would Mr. Major crow over isolating his country? Domestic politics is the answer. A handful of irreconcilables in the Conservative Party, led by Margaret Thatcher, are paranoid about Europe. Mr. Major thinks he needs to placate them so he can go into an election with a united party.
But that only points to a profound and long-term failure in British politics. Ian Davidson of the Financial Times, London, wrote after Maastricht that the failure was "the direct consequence of the defensive and adversarial vocabulary adopted consistently for the past 40 years by almost the entire political class in Britain towards the European Community."
Or to put it another way, too many politicians have fostered the delusion that Britain can Go It Alone. That is Little Englandism, the state of mind that produced the headline:

HEADLINE: Slovaks Are Closer to Hungary Than to Czechs;
Fate of the Language

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"As Slovak Separatism Gains, Havel Faces the Unthinkable" (front page, Nov. 20) states, "Until 1918, there were no schools that taught in Slovak." This is not accurate. 
 Although earlier Slovak literary languages existed, the codification by Ludovit Stur was the one accepted by the Slovaks. This Slovak literary language was introduced into some judicial proceedings and schools in the 1850's and 60's. It was used in political writings because it had become the symbol of Slovak nationalism.
By the 60's the center of Slovak political and cultural activity had moved to the central Slovak town of Turciansky Svaty Martin. The Institute of Slovak Culture was founded there in 1863 to preserve and propagate Slovak cultural and scholarly activity, and to improve the material welfare of the Slovak people.
However, Slovak nationalism suffered a devastating setback as a result of the 1867 agreement between Austria and Hungary that elevated the status of Hungary in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, enabling the Magyars to enforce a policy of denationalization against the Slovaks.
Instruction in the Slovak language was severely restricted. The three Slovak gymnasiums, or high schools, were closed in 1874, which put an end to higher education in the Slovak language. Elementary and secondary schools were mandated to teach Magyar, and eventually many of them ceased to teach in Slovak.
The Institute of Slovak culture was abolished in 1875 and its assets were confiscated by the Hungarian state. As before, the Slovak language was not used in state administration.
Few Slovaks qualified to vote, since voting required the fulfillment of certain conditions of birth, property and the paying of taxes. Most were able to obtain no employment other than as farm or industrial laborers. These harsh economic and social conditions caused about three-quarters of a million Slovaks to emigrate from Slovakia during the period from 1867 to 1914. Most of them went to the United States.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Cut in Funds Rate to 4 1/4% Is Expected

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The power of monetary policy to influence the economy has been tested in the last 16 months and appears to have been found wanting. The series of short-term interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve Board has had only a neglible effect in reversing the downturn.
Some analysts contend that the Fed, which has cut short-term rates by 2.25 percentage points since August 1990, when the recession began, has been too conservative. In their view, much deeper cuts in the overnight Federal funds rate are needed to stimulate the economy. 
 The Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet in Washington tomorrow, and is widely expected to cut the discount rate a half-point, to 4 percent, and the overnight Federal funds rate another quarter-point, to 4.25 percent.
 
A High Real Rate
 At those levels, short-term rates would be at their lowest since the early 1970's. But some analysts say such nominal measurements miss the point. On an inflation-adjusted basis, they argue, the real Fed funds rate remains quite high, particularly at this stage in the economic cycle.
"In past recessions, the Fed has had to push the funds rate substantially below the inflation rate to get the economy going," said Steven Slifer, executive vice president and financial market economist at Lehman Brothers.
In five of the last six recessions, the funds rate fell below the inflation rate.
Before the current downturn, the one exception to the rule had been the recession of 1982-83. But the damage done by the high funds rate during that period of contraction was more than offset, Mr. Slifer and others argue, by the widly stimulative tax package Congress enacted.
 
Stimulus Likely>
 Some sort of fiscal stimulus seems highly likely next year, and some analysts say the Fed will probably cease easing credit once it sees the shape and scope of the package.
But the fact that fiscal policy has been restrained thus far has meant that the careful cuts in the funds rate have not helped the economy as much as they might have had fiscal policy been stimulative, these analysts said.
"Given the hurdles we have out there to a full-fledged recovery, my guess is that it becomes more important to get the funds rate down close to the level of inflation, which is around 3 percent," said Gary Schlossberg, vice president and senior economist at the Wells Fargo Bank.
To be sure, not everyone uses the real Fed funds rate as a measure of the Fed's approach to policy.
"Monetary policy is very easy right now," said Leonard J. Santow, a managing director at Griggs & Santow Inc., a financial consulting firm in New York.
"You have a situation where the Fed has put a lot of reserves into the system and has the funds rate and the discount rate down. But banks have not been willing to pass those cuts through" to borrowers in the form of much lower mortgage and credit card rates, Mr. Santow added.
At this juncture, "the Fed is truly pushing on a string," he said.
Even though it is a market rate controlled by the Fed, the funds rate "is still highly relevant to the whole structure of interest rates," said Dana Johnson, chief money market economist at the First National Bank of Chicago, another analyst who says real short-term interest rates are still too high.
"There are lots and lots of individual decisions that are tied to short-term interest rates," he said. "If the Fed can make it easier by bringing these rates down, then that will be to the economy's benefit."
Given the slack in the manufacturing sector and the restructuring in the services industries, the dangers of reigniting inflation by aggressively pushing the funds rate down toward 3 percent are limited, these analysts said.
"Inflation will stay low in the United States for the next couple of years," said George Magnus, an economist and international bond strategist at S. G. Warburg Securities in London. Indeed, "a disinflationary environment will exist around the world for the first half of the decade."
 
Lower Inflation Predicted
 Analysts at the Morgan Guaranty Trust Company, who currently project that output will fall at an annual rate of 1.5 percent during the first half of 1992, noted in their latest weekly letter to clients that inflation readings of under 3 percent were entirely possible by late next year.
"The economy has not revived by means of passive quarter-point easings in the Federal funds rate engineered whenever an especially weak set of figures is reported," Walter M. Cadette, a Morgan economist wrote. "The distinct possibility is that the funds rate (and along with it the discount rate) will be pulled down decisively."
Watching and waiting for the Fed to make its widely anticipated move will probably dominate trading activity during the early part of the week.
Once that event is passed, the quiet holiday tone so often associated with Christmas and the end of the year is likely to settle over the fixed-income markets.

HEADLINE: EXECUTIVES EXPECT MANY '91 LAYOFFS TO BE PERMANENT

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The thousands of jobs being trimmed from the nation's work force by I.B.M., General Motors, Xerox, TRW and other major corporations are never coming back, executives say. That is the single biggest difference between the current economic slump and previous recessions.
"The recession was a lot worse than we thought, and it triggered this round of cutbacks," said George Davis, director of corporate human resource strategy at the Eastman Kodak Company in Rochester. "But if it were just the recession," he said, "we would be hiring these people back again. And we aren't going to do that." 
 Like past recessions, blue-collar workers have been hit harder than white-collar workers. Blue-collar unemployment stood at 10 percent at the end of October, white-collar unemployment at 4.2 percent.
 
Watching Lean Foreign Rivals
 Yet professionals, administrators and other desk-holders have lost jobs in record numbers, and economists believe the white-collar occupations and service industries will come under further pressure in the years ahead, just as manufacturing did in the 1980's.
The recession has forced many companies to face the fact that during the expansive 1980's they became bloated, especially in the white-collar ranks. To compete with lean foreign rivals, cuts must be made, the executives say, and the recession is mainly accelerating the process.
Kodak is in the midst of a program that pays workers to retire early, and up to 6,000 of its 80,000 domestic employees are expected to accept the company's offer.
When the Xerox Corporation announced last week that it was trimming 2,500, or 20 percent, of its white-collar jobs, the company said the uncertain economy was only forcing it to speed up cost-cutting plans already in place. "We would have done this over the next two years anyway," said Paul Allaire, Xerox's chairman.
At the International Business Machines Corporation, which last month said it would pare another 20,000 workers from its 350,000-job payroll by next year -- on top of the 65,000 jobs it has eliminated since 1986 -- a key goal is to reduce the administrative staff in an effort to make the big computer company faster on its feet.
"Companies don't see improvement on the horizon, so they are moving now," said Garrett Dietz, a specialist in cost cutting at Towers Perrin, a management consultant. "Cutbacks show immediate change, and they make the corporate boards and Wall Street happy."
And John Stewart, a director of McKinsey & Company, a consulting firm, said, "These jobs are not going to come back after the recession, because a lot of companies are making fundamental changes in their structure and how they do business."
The most recent cutbacks were prompted by slumping sales and profits. After corporate profits fell 28 percent in the third quarter, pressure was turned up in executive suites to take quick action to control costs.
The pace of announced cutbacks has accelerated sharply since October to 2,600 each working day. "It's a panic reaction after the hoped-for recovery failed to materialize," said Dan Lacey, editor of Workplace Trends, a newsletter.
 
Shakeout in Services Seen
 Some economists say they are concerned that the layoffs and the drought of consumer confidence combine in a vicious circle. Workers fearful of losing their jobs will not spend, they say, while companies seem prepared to keep trimming until consumer spending rebounds.
"Consumers and corporations are locked into a cycle of fear, with neither side moving until the other does," said Edward McKelvey, a senior economist at Goldman Sachs & Company.
While manufacturing jobs were being squeezed by foreign competition, the service industries -- banking, retailing, advertising and others -- added 17.9 million jobs in the 1980's. By the end of the decade, private-sector service jobs totaled 65.8 million. But productivity growth in services was sluggish, improving only seven-tenths of a percent a year, compared with manufacturing productivity increases of 2.7 percent annually in the 1980's. Thus, economists say that the American service sector is ripe for a shakeout.
"The critical issue for the 1990's is going to be job security, as more and more people are squeezed by the restructuring in services," said Stephen Roach, an economist at Morgan Stanley & Company. "And this is going to continue long after this recession is over."
For corporate managements, the catchy concept of the moment is winnowing the company down to its "core," both in terms of its work force and its product lines. One way to do that is to farm out more work to subcontractors or contract workers, who can be quickly hired or dismissed as demand rises or falls.
The CDI Corporation of Philadelphia, for example, has grown rapidly in recent years as it became a leading supplier of temporary engineers and other skilled workers to major companies, including General Motors. But this "outsourcing" business has not been recession-proof either, as CDI found when G.M. slashed its product development plans.
"We got hit this year as G.M. cut back," said Walter Garrison, CDI's president.
Many companies have found they can trim costs by 10 percent or 15 percent a year through a series of small steps, from reducing the frequency of internal reports and meetings to eliminating the corporate dining room.
Sometimes, companies reduce employment by streamlining and by automating activities previously done by hand. Sears, Roebuck & Company, for example, is trimming its retailing work force by 33,000, or roughly 10 percent, over the next two years.
Most of the trims at Sears will be in so-called nonsales positions, and the job cuts will result from steps like simplifying and eliminating stockroom tasks, and having customers consult telephone kiosks in stores for information instead of talking to a clerk. Sears, whose merchandising group generates $32 billion a year in revenue, estimates that its savings from the cutbacks will be $1.3 billion over the next two years.
 
Cutting Morale and Trust, Too
 Corporate executives and management consultants warn that there are risks for companies slashing their work force. "The real problem with layoffs is not the people that leave the company, but the people that stay," said Carlene Ellis, vice president of human resources for the Intel Corporation, a Silicon Valley producer of semiconductors. "We've decided that it's very costly in terms or morale and trust that is lost."
During the mid-1980's slump in the semiconductor industry, Intel, based in Santa Clara, Calif., had layoffs but vowed to try to avoid more. So for the last two years, the company has used a redeployment program in which about 600 workers a year have been retrained and assigned new jobs instead of being laid off. Workers in a plant that was shut, for example, have been retrained to work elsewhere, moved into desk jobs or, in a few cases, become product designers.
"It's time consuming and costly," Ms. Ellis said, "but we think we're better off in the long run."

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 16 about cutbacks at major American corporations misstated the timing of a 33,000-job reduction by Sears, Roebuck & Company. The jobs are all being eliminated this year, not over the next two years.

HEADLINE: SOVIET DISARRAY;
Soviet Military Attends Yeltsin's Talks With Baker

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 16

 BODY:
In the clearest signal to date that the military is supporting the new commonwealth of former Soviet republics rather than the disintegrating Soviet Union, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia brought the Soviet Defense and Interior Ministers to a Kremlin meeting today with Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d.
At a session in the same room where Soviet leaders in the past met with foreign dignitaries, Mr. Yeltsin told Mr. Baker that the new commonwealth would be functioning by mid-January, probably with at least 10 of the former republics as members. He added that the commonwealth's leadership would have full control over all nuclear weapons. 
 Eventually, Mr. Yeltsin predicted, all the former republics except Russia will become nuclear-free.
To help promote the shift in power from the old Union to the new commonwealth, Mr. Yeltsin appealed to Mr. Baker to recognize the independence of Russia and to support a handover of the Soviet seat on the United Nations Security Council to the Russian republic.
The Russian President used a variety of gestures today to underscore that power was now in his hands and no longer in President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's. Showing off his new prominence, Mr. Yeltsin met Mr. Baker in the morning in the same room in the ornate Catherine's Hall of the Kremlin, and in the same chair, where Mr. Gorbachev had received state visitors since 1985. Mr. Gorbachev met Mr. Baker in the same room later in the day.
More revealing was the fact that Mr. Yeltsin brought the Defense Minister of the crumbling Soviet Union, Marshal Yevgeny I. Shaposhnikov, and the Interior Minister, Victor Barannikov, to sit alongside him for his talks with Mr. Baker. That reinforced the message that the military and internal security forces were backing the new commonwealth, not Mr. Gorbachev.
When Mr. Baker met with Mr. Gorbachev in the afternoon, he found him accompanied only by two longtime confidants, Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze and Aleksandr Yakovlev, the Soviet President's close political adviser. Both had quit in frustration with Mr. Gorbachev a year ago and came back only after the failed coup in August.
 
Dizzying Day for Baker
 It was something of an emotionally dizzying day for Mr. Baker. He met with an optimistic and ebullient Mr. Yeltsin in the morning, and then with a sullen Mr. Gorbachev in the early afternoon, and finally, after a brief session alone with General Shaposhnikov, he had a nostalgic get-together with his longtime friend Mr. Shevardnadze.
While Mr. Gorbachev, in his brief remarks before his talk with Mr. Baker, stoically maintained his position that the union was not dead, the same was not true of Mr. Shevardnadze. His news conference with Mr. Baker turned into a sentimental farewell by two men who had cooperated on resolving most key international issues in the last three years.
The whole thrust of Mr. Shevardnadze's remarks were to the effect that the union was now over, that the future would be determined by the presidents of the republics and that the important thing was that there be a smooth transition to a new political entity, which he hoped would maintain some sort of "well-coordinated foreign policy."
In his four-hour session with Mr. Baker, Mr. Yeltsin assured the Secretary of State that the new commonwealth would have firm control over the 27,000 nuclear weapons on the territory of the former Soviet Union. This would be achieved by appointing a supreme military commander, who could push the nuclear button only with the agreement of the leaders of the four former Soviet republics that have long-range nuclear missiles on their territories: Russia, Byelorussia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan. Kazakhstan today became the last of the group to formally declare its independence and its support for the commonwealth.
Mr. Baker said he felt "very reassured" by his meetings today that Soviet nuclear weapons were under tight control. The Tass press agency quoted General Shaposhnikov as telling Mr. Baker that short-range nuclear weapons from around the former union were already being gathered up and put into "centralized storage" for "elimination," in accordance with the cuts that the United States and Soviet Union agreed to last September.
 
'Full Consideration' Promised
 As for the future political shape of this country, Mr. Baker studiously maintained his neutrality in the continuing power struggle between the Russian President and the Soviet President, who is still trying to hold together a variation of the old Union. All Mr. Baker would tell Mr. Yeltsin publicly was that Washington would "give full consideration" to the Russian requests.
During the talks and joint news conference of Mr. Baker and Mr. Yeltsin, the Russian President clearly tried to demonstrate to Mr. Baker that the balance of power inside the former Soviet Union was now firmly on his side and that the new commonwealth would be able to satisfy all of the nuclear, human rights and economic concerns that the United States had about it.
The Russian President told reporters after his meeting with Mr. Baker that Kazakhstan and four other Central Asian republics would formally sign the commonwealth agreement on Saturday and that he hoped by the end of the month that Armenia and Moldavia would also come on board, leaving only Georgia, Azerbaijan and the three Baltic nations out of the new political entity.
Mr. Yeltsin said that he expected the process of forming the new commonwealth, and its major political and military functions, to take "from mid-December to mid-January of next year."
Despite Mr. Baker's refusal to say anything in public to suggest that he was taking sides between Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Gorbachev, there nevertheless seemed to be a passing of the torch in the way today's meetings were organized. As Mr. Baker drove through the red-brick gates of the Kremlin this morning, he found its gardens and buildings covered in a blanket of snow, with the red Soviet hammer and sickle flag still fluttering from a tower.
 
A New Salutation
 The Yeltsin-Baker meeting began in the gilded Catherine Hall of the Kremlin. By protocol, the Soviet side always enters from one end of the long hall and the American side from the other. The leaders then meet in the center of the room for a handshake. For the last three years that is how Mr. Baker and Mr. Gorbachev have done it.
Today, though, when the double doors swung open, Mr. Baker found Mr. Yeltsin striding across the hall, and when they met in the middle Mr. Baker was greeted with a salutation he had also never heard before. "Welcome to Russian soil, and this Russian building," Mr. Yeltsin said. "That is important."
Later today, the independent news agency Interfax reported that the Russian Parliament had approved a resolution placing all Soviet parliamentary property -- buildings and bank accounts -- under Russian jurisdiction.
Mr. Yeltsin began his meeting with Mr. Baker by introducing his delegation to the Secretary of State. He introduced General Shaposhnikov as the Defense Minister and Mr. Barannakov as the Interior Minister of "the former Union."
At his joint news conference with Mr. Baker after their meeting, Mr. Yeltsin outlined some of the main principles that have already been agreed upon. Mr. Yeltsin said that once all of the member republics had joined the commonwealth, they would sign a defense union treaty that would provide "for a single authority that would exercise power" over all armed forces, including the air force, naval forces, air defense forces, nuclear weapons, both strategic and tactical, as well as intelligence-gathering operations.
Mr. Yeltsin did not explain how this proposal would square with the announcement by Ukraine's President, Leonid A. Kravchuk, that he intends to be commander in chief of all troops on Ukraine soil. General Shaposhnikov told Mr. Baker there was "a certain concern" about the stand of the Ukraine leadership.
 
Military Man in Command
 Mr. Yeltsin said this defense authority would be headed by a supreme military commander, who would obey the orders of the council of heads of state of the commonwealth's members.
"Concerning the post of supreme commander," Mr. Yeltsin said, "I would like to dismiss all the reports that appeared in the press last night concerning the alleged proposals of our side to have Gorbachev the commander in chief of these forces. The idea is to have a military man in this post, who would be directly responsible to the executive council of the commonwealth."
Mr. Yeltsin said that he respected Mr. Gorbachev, but that as to his future "it is for him personally to determine."
On the issue of who will have the authority to launch any of the 27,000 Soviet nuclear weapons, Mr. Yeltsin said Ukraine and Beyelorussia. which along with Kazakhstan and Russia are the only republics where long-range nuclear missiles are based, have already declared their intention to become nuclear free.
The nuclear missiles on the soil of Ukraine and Beyelorussia will not be transferred to Russia, Mr. Yeltsin said, but will be "eliminated within the framework of" the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty and other agreements between the Soviet Union and the United States. The future of Kazakhstan's nuclear missiles, Mr. Yeltsin said, has not been determined yet. As for Russia, he said it would retain nuclear weapons "for the time being."
In the meantime, the Russian President said, any decision to use Soviet nuclear weapons in an emergency will be made by "the leaders of the four nuclear republics," together with supreme commander of the commonwealth forces. These figures will constitute the single, unified command for Soviet nuclear weapons and "the order to push the button and launch nuclear missiles can only come from the single center," he said.
Mr. Yeltsin's military adviser, Gen. Konstantin I. Kobez, said in an interview with Le Monde published today that until this new defense council can be established, control of Soviet nuclear weapons is in the hands of President Gorbachev, President Yeltsin and Defense Minister Shaposhnikov. The approval of all three would be required for a missile launch.
Mr. Baker chose not to hold a joint news conference with Mr. Gorbachev, as he had with Mr. Yeltsin, but used the photo session before their meeting to praise the Soviet leader in what seemed like a valedictory.
Partly out of a desire not to be accused of intervening in the internal affairs of the former Soviet Union, and even more out of a sense of loyalty to Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Shevardnadze, with whom he and President Bush cooperated on so many diplomatic endeavors, Mr. Baker refrained from saying anything that would look as though he was turning his back on Mr. Gorbachev.
He told Mr. Gorbachev that many of the positive changes the Soviet Union and the world had seen in the last three years would not have happened "but for your efforts."
 
'A Very Difficult Period'
 As for Mr. Baker and Mr. Shevardnadze, they held a joint news conference in the Osabnyak Guest House, where they had held so many meetings in the last three years to cooperate on the reunification of Europe, the Persian Gulf war, Arab-Israeli peace talks and the strategic and conventional arms treaties.
A sullen and weary looking Mr. Shevardnadze began the session by saying of Mr. Baker: "We go into a very difficult period. It gives me particular pleasure to note that this time I had another opportunity to talk to a person whom I hold in a very high respect. I cherish the relationship that developed between us and also take pride in the fact that the two of us have made a certain contribution to developing a new relationship between our two countries."
Mr. Baker, who constantly referred to Mr. Shevardnadze as his "colleague and friend," responded in a melancholy tenor: "I look around this room and the room that we just concluded our meeting in and I am reminded of the many meetings we have had here over the course of the past three years and I am reminded as well of some of the accomplishments that flowed from those meetings, and tonight we are discussing somewhat different topics and facing up to and confronting somewhat different problems than we have discussed in prior meetings in this room."

HEADLINE: Hard Line in Beijing Fails to Kill Boom

SERIES: China's Fortunes: Progress Amid Stagnation -- First of two articles.

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GUIYANG, China

 BODY:
Jiang Lianxiang has a modest living room, with a sofa, a television, a refrigerator that doesn't fit in her dollhouse-sized kitchen, and an abiding faith that her son will be richer than his parents. Here, it almost seems as if the 1989 Tiananmen crackdown on dissent had never happened.
"Our incomes are still going up," said Ms. Jiang, a relaxed and smiling woman of 41, as she sipped tea in her living room and watched her son practice his calligraphy in a corner. "We have most things we could want. Of course, the boy wanted an electric fan for the summer, but if you open the window it's really not so hot. And we talked about getting a video player, but then we were afraid that might disturb the boy from doing his homework each evening. So we pretty much have what we need." 
 This economic complacency is not what was expected after the army throttled the democracy movement 1,080 miles away in Beijing. Many Chinese and foreigners alike believed that with tanks crushing student tents at Tiananmen Square, the economy risked collapse as well, through a decline in foreign investment, a rollback of economic reforms and an increasingly disgruntled and uncooperative work force.
But none of that has happened, at least not so far. It is one of the paradoxes of the 1990's: China, with a hard-line Communist leadership, is booming along at a 6 percent growth rate, with low inflation, foreign investment up, and exports and foreign exchange reserves at record highs.
In contrast, democratic India, Asia's other third-world giant, is struggling along with a 4 percent growth rate, a trade deficit, and double-digit inflation. As for the Soviet Union, the other country with which China is most often compared, its economy has sunk further into chaos as the country fragments in the aftermath of the hard-liners' failed coup in August.
Of course, there are clear differences among the three countries, and no one seems to think that repression makes good economic sense. But so far, against most expectations, China has not paid any overwhelming economic price for pursuing a hard-line ideology.
"The doomsaying that went on a couple of years ago, on so many fronts, has not come about," said Nicholas Lardy, a specialist on the Chinese economy at the University of Washington. "In fact, I can't think of any negative forecasts that have come to pass."
To be sure, there is still deep bitterness toward the Government in many circles, and there is a common belief that the hard-liners are doomed. And for the economy the last few years have not been clear sailing by any means.
Beginning in late 1989, China endured its worst slump in more than a decade. The recovery is now well under way, but many Chinese economists worry that inflation will soon come roaring back. And the state-owned sector of the economy is still a disaster area: unreformed, inefficient and perhaps hopeless.
Yet over all, despite immense troubles in the state sector, the Chinese economy is enjoying far more vigorous growth than the economies of the United States, Japan, India or most other countries, rich or poor. This kind of steady economic growth is the crucial feature of Deng Xiaoping's strategy to preserve Communist Party rule in China. Mr. Deng, the ailing 87-year-old architect of present-day China, argues that if the party can raise living standards substantially, ordinary people will support Communist rule and overlook such matters as the army assault on pro-democracy demonstrators in 1989.
"In the end, convincing those who do not believe in socialism will depend on our nation's development," the official Economic Daily recently quoted Mr. Deng as saying. "If we can reach a comfortable standard of living by the end of this century, then that will wake them up a bit. And in the next century, when we as a socialist country join the middle ranks of the developed nations, that will help to convince them. Most of these people will genuinely see that they were mistaken."
 
Expectations Rise Faster Than Income
 Mr. Deng seems to be right that many ordinary Chinese are far more concerned with whether they can "fa cai" -- get rich -- than with repression of dissidents. But it is not at all clear that growing prosperity will make them more supportive of the Communist Party, for two reasons.
The first reason is that while incomes are rising, expectations are rising even more quickly. Consequently, many people seem dissatisfied with their stunning economic progress and some even insist -- absurdly -- that they are worse off financially than they were a few years ago.
The second reason is that many Chinese believe that they owe their fatter wallets not to Communism but to capitalism. And many economists here say they are right.
After a dozen years of economic restructuring, China sometimes seems more capitalist than Communist, and that is one reason why the country is doing so well. Most of the growth now is coming from private and collective enterprises, not from the state-owned behemoths. China's politics and oratory may be hard-line Communist, but brush aside the slogans and what emerges is that the economy's saving grace is that it is deeply pluralistic.
The state sector accounts for only about one-third of China's gross national product and 18 percent of the labor force. The goods and services purchased by the Government total only 6 percent of G.N.P., just one-half the level in India. China's 800 million peasants live in their own homes, work for themselves on individual plots of land that are more or less their own, and increasingly engage in small-scale capitalist ventures that make everything from tofu to ball bearings.
"Our policy is to talk all the time about socialism, while moving more and more toward the private sector," quipped a Chinese official who returned recently from a visit to the Soviet Union. "The Soviets are just the opposite. They're talking all the time about reform, but they still haven't changed anything. There, the state still owns everything."
Thus China sometimes seems to be repeating the slogan "Socialism Forever!" as it heads directly toward a market economy.
Important reforms are again on the Chinese agenda these days, although the leadership still balks at any rapid restructuring of the state sector. Despite protests from some of the nation's octogenarian leaders, like Vice President Wang Zhen, China is moving ahead on stock issues in the cities of Shanghai and Shenzhen. Canton may get a stock market by the end of next year, and foreigners will be permitted to buy special "B Shares" beginning early next year.
"Li Peng personally favors central planning," said an economist who has discussed economics with the Prime Minister. "But he knows that he has no choice. He's got to move toward the market, and that's what's happening in China now."
 
Shift to Market Continues Apace
 Aside from the nurturing of stock markets, there are several other reforms now gaining momentum:
*The Government this year began to raise money by issuing bonds underwritten in part by securities firms, in place of the old system of issuing bonds that people were simply forced to buy. Chinese workers used to dread the automatic deductions from their paychecks to pay for bonds, but now the securities pay reasonable interest and can be sold before they mature.
*China, beginning this year and next, is inaugurating large-scale "housing reform," by raising rents from their present unrealistic levels (a few dollars per month or less) and by encouraging families to buy the homes in which they live.
*The Government this year raised prices of grain, cooking oil, bus fares, rail transportation and other goods and services to levels that more closely reflect their value. Already, most goods in Chinese shops are sold at market-determined prices, rather than at state-fixed prices.
*China is moving toward making the yuan a convertible currency. A 31 percent devaluation over the last two years has left the official exchange rate little different from the black market rate, and many companies and some individuals can now trade their foreign exchange at near-market prices at specially created currency markets in major cities.
While foreign economists applaud these moves to rationalize the Chinese economy, ironically many ordinary Chinese are far less enthusiastic. In particular, workers are alarmed by the freeing of prices and rents, because the upshot is that they will have to pay more for their apartments and more for food and other necessities.
Thus some Chinese economists say, with barely disguised glee, it will be the hard-liners who will be blamed for the costs of market liberalization.
Already in China, it is sometimes startling how enthusiastic many people are about anything that smacks of capitalism.
When a liberal American man married a Chinese woman who had graduated with a degree in economics, he was surprised to find her a disciple of Milton Friedman and an absolute believer in markets. In their dinner table discussions, it was left to him, the nominal capitalist, to defend the proposition that the Government sometimes has a role to play in the economy.
"You just look at our economy and it's pretty obvious," said an economics professor, looking over his shoulder to make sure no one will overhear his heresy. "What's the most vibrant sector? Private business! What's next? The collectives. And which is least efficient and always manages to lose money? The state sector!"
Yet most fundamentally, what is changing is not so much the policies as the attitudes toward markets and competition. These attitudes have yet to infiltrate state-owned companies in any concerted way, which is partly why the state conglomerates are in such trouble, but they have spread throughout society itself.
 
Business Careers Gain in Status
 Until a few years ago, for example, many intellectuals held the traditional Confucian view that business was a low-status occupation and beneath their efforts. Consequently, many of China's entrepreneurs were ex-convicts who could get no other jobs and were forced to sell clothing or videos in small stalls.
In the last few years, however, more and more university graduates have also gone into business, largely because they can earn incomes many times greater than those if they work as Government officials. Most people expect that the boom in the private sector will continue, with at least the tacit approval of the Government, and entrepreneurs are enjoying rising status.
"It used to be a girl wanted to marry a guy who had a nice job as an official," said a 20-year-old woman in the town of Bijie in Guizhou Province. "But now a lot of girls say to heck with that. They'd rather marry a guy who's into business, and who can spend some money on them."
Joint ventures with foreign companies are particularly prized employers, and the most brilliant graduates of Beijing universities now often aim for jobs at such concerns in the way that students a few years ago used to seek jobs with the Communist Party Central Committee. Now there are more such companies than ever, and foreign investment has picked up particularly quickly in the last few months.
Even after the 1989 crackdown, foreign investment rose somewhat, against most predictions. Taiwan companies poured in cash to make up for the slowdown in investment by American and European companies.
And in any case, China gets far more hard currency from exports than from investments or tourism, and exports to the United States and other countries have been booming for the last two years. This export boom might collapse, however, if the United States revokes -- as Congress threatens to -- the trade benefits known as most favored nation status.
 
The New Breed Of Businessman
 Zhong Hongru, a 47-year-old man with piercing eyes and thick hair brushed neatly back over a high forehead, is an example of the new breed of businessman in China. Until 1987, he was a doctor here in Guiyang, earning $40 a month. Then he left the hospital and started his own trading company, initially bringing sweaters from Shanghai to sell in local shops.
Last year, Mr. Zhang's company earned nearly $1 million in profit. He has diversified into everything from chopsticks to Maotai wine, and his apartment boasts a Japanese-made television and an enormous stereo system. As he relaxed on his couch on a recent afternoon, Mr. Zhang seemed confident that the Government would continue to tolerate private enterprises like his own -- if for no other reason than that they are too important to squelch. He notes that he pays $100,000 a year in taxes and employs 500 people.
"Look, I'm contributing to the state," Mr. Zhang said, with a twinkle in his eye. "So whatever the problems with this or that policy, I think the direction of reform will continue."

HEADLINE: Pessimism at the Fed;
For First Time, Greenspan Is Suggesting Rate Cuts Alone May Not Revive Economy

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
A new pessimism, evident in Alan Greenspan's latest speeches and in other recent comments, suggests that the chairman of the Federal Reserve now believes that new efforts by the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates will not necessarily revive the economy, as lower rates have in the past. So additional measures might have to be tried, among them Federal spending or tax cuts.
For months, the Federal Reserve confidently said that an economic upturn was just around the corner. Now, for the first time, Mr. Greenspan is suggesting that he has no clear idea when the economy's current stagnation might end: by spring, by Election Day, by early 1993 or perhaps not until later in the decade. 
 Until now, Mr. Greenspan has been adamantly opposed to tax cuts or public spending, on the ground that such fiscal measures would run up the deficit, which he still does not want to do. But his concern that the economy is dead in the water appears to be overcoming some of his aversion to Federal pump priming. Above all, he is concerned that what he has called the "utterly unprecedented" debt burden of consumers and businesses will not be resolved in some standard, easily measurable way.
 "Usually the Fed guys are optimistic as a matter of professional responsibility," said Robert Johnson, a managing director at Bankers Trust and a former Federal Reserve economist. "Mr. Greenspan's pessimism is quite candid, and it tells you how scary this recession is."
The Federal Reserve chairman is scheduled to testify tomorrow before the House Ways and Means Committee, which is seeking solutions to a recession that showed itself again yesterday with the announcement that industrial production fell four-tenths of 1 percent in November. He almost certainly will be asked about spending or tax programs that Congress and the Administration could undertake to stimulate the economy.
In none of his remarks has Mr. Greenspan given any details of the proposals he seems to be considering. He does suggest that a responsible fiscal package -- one that would not raise either the deficit or the inflation rate -- is conceivable. But the small sums involved might not be enough to help the economy.
Mr. Greenspan's views appeared to be in part an answer to critics, both in the Bush Administration and in the economics profession, who say that the economy would bounce back if the Federal Reserve would cut short-term interest rates more than the 3.75 percentage points that it has already cut since the recession started 18 months ago. The chairman, who until recently had thought that lower rates would do the job, is now in effect asking for help, and in doing so, he is putting pressure on the White House and Congress to play a role in ending the recession, said David Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston, a Wall Street investment house.
 
 
'A Major Conversion'
 "Mr. Greenspan appears to have undergone a major conversion," Mr. Jones said. "What he has been saying recently is that the economy is in more difficulty than he thought it was a few months ago, and recovery requires more than just cutting interest rates. He is groping for other solutions, and one is fiscal help to jump-start the economy."
The essence of Mr. Greenspan's alarm about the economy -- the reason he seems willing to debate fiscal policy -- lies in what he calls "a heavy overhang of debt" and "the unusual degree of caution" that it has engendered among businesses, consumers and lenders. Both the debt load and the public determination to pay it down are without precedent since 1941, in the Greenspan view. As a result, Mr. Greenspan seems to imply that no method exists to measure accurately when Americans might feel sufficiently solvent to spend and invest again, thus making the economy grow and recover.
The problem, in sum, is more a psychological one than a process that can be measured with statistics, Mr. Greenspan suggests. Economists must rely more on anecdotal evidence than on such things as income-to-debt ratios or the level of mortgage rates to gauge progress toward a healthy economy. That is an unusual acknowledgement for Mr. Greenspan, whose forte is statistics. It means that the economics profession lacks the tools to forecast just when this recession might end.
Americans, in fact, might be so shaken by their experiences of the last two years -- stagnant wages, insecure jobs, falling real estate prices, the reluctance of banks to renew loans, incomes inadequate to make debt payments -- that they might not regain their confidence until they work down debt to 1950's or 1960's levels, Mr. Greenspan suggests. Car loans in the 1950's, for example, normally ran two years; today the norm is four to five years.
 
 
Recent Speeches Cited
 Mr. Greenspan had the debt burden in mind on Oct. 29 when, in a speech to business executives in Providence, R.I., he said that the economy was trying to move forward against a "50-mile-an-hour headwind." Another speech, on Dec. 6 at the annual convention of the Securities Industry Association, was devoted to the debt problem and its impact on the economy.
Mr. Greenspan's pessimism contrasts sharply with his euphoria of last summer, when he told Congress, "There are compelling signs that the recession is behind us." As recently as late September, he said that a consumption level higher than production was pushing up factory output. In past recessions, this has led to more employment, growing income, more consumption and, in sum, an expanding economy. But the incipient improvement halted in October.
Now Mr. Greenspan appears to be parting company with the prevailing White House view that consumer and business debt will be sufficiently worked down by next June to permit new activity and a recovery. David W. Mullins Jr., the vice chairman of the Federal Reserve and recently its chief public spokesman, also offers this view.
Mr. Greenspan does not reject the idea. Quite the contrary, he considers an upturn by next summer a distinct possibility. But equally possible, in the Greenspan analysis, is the possibility that the stagnant, debt-burdened economy could tip into a fresh downturn. That possibility has not been publicly expressed by the Federal Reserve and is just now being nudged forward by its chairman.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Traders Await Sign From the Fed

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities and interest rates were little changed yesterday, as dealers waited to see if the Federal Reserve Board would push short-term interest rates down again.
The Fed's Open Market Committee is scheduled to meet today in Washington amid speculation that it will lower its target for the overnight Federal funds rate by a quarter of a percentage point and drop its discount rate by half a point. 
 Traders said it was unlikely that the central bank would announce any changes until tomorrow, however.
 
Supported by Numbers
 The case for another round of rate cuts to stimulate the economy was bolstered yesterday when the Fed reported that manufacturing output fell by four-tenths of 1 percent in November, a larger decline than expected. Nevertheless, the report had almost no impact on prices in the credit markets.
Some officials from the Bush Administration and the Fed, meanwhile, made optimistic statements about the economy yesterday.
John P. LaWare, a Fed governor, said in a speech in Baltimore that a recent acceleration in money-supply growth was likely to stimulate the sluggish economy. Separately, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said that the credit shortage had eased in recent weeks.
 
 
Fed Action Urged
 Those comments came even as recent speeches and remarks by the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, suggested some pessimism about the direction of the economy -- a view many analysts have asserted for some time.
Some analysts say now that the Fed needs to be more aggressive.
"The Fed has spent an awful long time doing as little as possible," said Robert A. Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities. "And based on what they have done in past recessions, they have more work to do."
Mr. Brusca said the Fed would likely need to push the Federal funds rate -- the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, currently at 4 1/4 percent -- down to 3 3/4 percent or lower to get the economy moving.
Edward Yardeni, chief economist at C. J. Lawrence, said, "I'm still shocked the Fed didn't lower the discount rate by a full point after the November employment report was released on Dec. 6." The discount rate is what the Government charges banks for loans.
"You are beginning to see that people are really getting scared, and I share the average consumers' concerns about the outlook," Mr. Yardeni said. "But I wonder if the Fed recognizes the magnitude of the problem."
 
Limits on New Bonds
 Bond prices did respond yesterday to remarks by Deputy Treasury Secretary John E. Robson. Speaking at the same Baltimore conference that Mr. LaWare had addressed, Mr. Robson reiterated that the Treasury was considering limiting the sale of new bonds.
Bond prices moved higher after the news, but some dealers said the idea was potentially dangerous.
"If you are going to change the rules, there is naturally going to be more uncertainty," one government bond trader said.
In the secondary market for Treasury securities, the 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 102 7/8, up 6/32, to yield 7.75 percent, compared with 7.76 percent late on Friday.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered at 102 1/4 in late trading, up 1/8 point, to yield 7.17 percent. And the 5.50 percent two-year notes were unchanged at an offered price of 100 27/ 32, to yield 5.04 percent.
 
Bills Rates Fall at Auction
 Short-term Treasury bill rates continued to fall at the weekly auction of three- and six-month securities.
Three-month bills were sold at an average discount rate of 4.14 percent, down from an average rate of 4.21 percent at last week's sale. The three-month bill rate was the lowest since the auction of Aug. 21, 1972, when the rate was 4.058 percent.
Bids on the new six-month bills generated an average discount rate of 4.19 percent, little changed from the 4.20 percent average rate at the sale a week ago. Nevertheless, it is the lowest rate on a six-month bill since June 12, 1972, when the rate was 4.187 percent.
 
Corporate Debt
 In the investment-grade corporate bond market, Heller Financial offered $200 million of seven-year notes through an underwriting group led by Goldman, Sachs & Company.
The 8 percent notes, which mature Dec. 15, 1998, were priced at $99.647 to yield 8.066 percent, 1.32 percentage points more than the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 7 1/8 percent seven-year notes at the time of pricing.
The securities were rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and A by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
 
Municipal Bonds
 Trading was slow in the tax-exempt municipal bond market, as dealers prepared bids on some $1 billion of New York City securities that are expected to be priced today.
The bulk of the securities -- about $800 million, according to some estimates -- will either carry insurance or will be backed by letters of credit.
Preliminary discussions about prices in advance of the negotiated sale placed the maximum yield on uninsured securities at around 7.75 percent. The maximum yield on the insured bonds is expected to be around 6.80 percent, dealers said.
Following are the results of yesterday's auction of three-month and six-month Treasury bills:

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
A Maxwell Flagship in Bankruptcy

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
The Maxwell Communication Corporation, the publicly held corporate flagship of Robert Maxwell, tonight became the latest domino to fall in his crumbling publishing empire when it announced that it had filed for bankruptcy protection from creditors in New York.
In a statement issued late tonight, the company, which owns several American businesses -- including Macmillan Inc., the big publishing house -- said an important reason its board had decided to seek protection in the United States was because "the bulk of its revenue and operating profit is generated by businesses located in the United States." 
 Those businesses, which account for about 80 percent of the company's assets, also include Official Airline Guides, P. F. Collier encyclopedias and half of the Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing Company. Maxwell Communication said the holding company was the only concern in bankruptcy under the filing, not the operating companies.
 
$1.25 Billion in U.S. Revenues
 The American businesses have revenues of $1.25 billion and operating profits of about $225 million, the company said.
By filing for protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, which gives the company time to work out a plan to pay its debt, the company is trying to put itself into a stronger position to bargain with its 40 or so lending banks, which were scheduled to meet on Wednesday.
The bankers had already been talking about breaking up the company and selling off parts of it to pay off the company's debt, which totals 1.3 billion ($2.37 billion), the company said.
 The only question in many of the bankers' minds was whether to push for the company to be liquidated immediately or to wait for an economic recovery in the United States so that the businesses might fetch a higher price. While the larger lenders seemed to prefer selling the company off piecemeal over the next two to three years, some smaller ones apparently did not want to be stuck that long.
 
 
Meeting With Banks
 The decision to seek bankruptcy protection in the United States came after a meeting this afternoon with a steering committee of the banks, where a special investigation of the company's financial health that has been conducted by Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm, was presumably discussed.
In an interview tonight, John Coyle, a Maxwell Communication spokesman, contended that there had been "no threats" from the banks at the meeting. But he said he did not know whether the banks had been informed of the Chapter 11 filing or whether they had agreed to it before the company had acted.
The Daily News in New York, which is owned by a private company that belonged to the Maxwell family, sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Dec. 5, also in New York. It did so immediately after the two private holding companies at the heart of the Maxwell empire, one of which is the paper's parent, filed for the British equivalent of bankruptcy protection.
Some analysts say they believe that one reason The Daily News filed was to insulate itself from the bankruptcy administrators appointed by an English court, who conceivably might have been less willing to keep it going. There are also suspicions that Kevin Maxwell, the son of Robert Maxwell who has been active in trying to draw up a reorganization plan for The Daily News, is hoping that he will be able to use American law to hold on to that piece of the Maxwell empire.
Even before the empire's collapse, Maxwell Communication's financial health had been fragile. It had been struggling under the burden of its debt, which it had mainly accumulated when Robert Maxwell paid $2.6 billion for Macmillan and $750 million for Official Airline Guides in 1988.
In the last couple of years, the company sold off a slew of businesses to pare its debt. In early November, the company's leaders had even thought that it would be able to meet its next big debt payment -- $750 million due next October -- without having to sell its core businesses.
But then the private Maxwell companies, which own most of the family's 68 percent stake in Maxwell Communication, collapsed under a mountain of debt and filed for the British equivalent of bankruptcy protection early this month.
 
Effect of Pension Revelation
 But it was not their bankruptcy action that forced Maxwell Communication to follow suit today. The reason was undoubtedly the revelation that Robert Maxwell had siphoned off more than $1.4 billion from employee pension funds and his two mainstay public companies: Maxwell Communication and Mirror Group Newspapers.
Maxwell Communication confirmed tonight that Mr. Maxwell and possibly others had taken about 244 million ($444.1 million) from the company, plus almost all of its 56 percent stake in Berlitz International, the language-instruction firm. The latter appears to have been pledged as collateral for loans to the private Maxwell companies.
"Over 90 percent of the Berlitz shares have been pledged wrongly," Mr. Coyle said. In addition, he said, about 60 million ($109.2 million) was missing from Maxwell Communication's pension fund.
The discovery that the Berlitz shares had been pledged as security for a loan has delayed -- and could scuttle -- a deal that Maxwell Communication struck last month to sell the Berlitz stake to Fukutake Publishing of Japan for $265 million.
 
'No More Skeletons' Seen
 Asked tonight whether the Price Waterhouse examination had found signs that even more could be missing, Mr. Coyle said, "There's no more skeletons as far as we can see."
Even so, analysts say that at best, the value of the company's assets is probably equal to that of its debts and, depending on how much of the stolen assets can be recovered, may be worth less than the debts.
Mr. Laister, the Maxwell Communication chairman, stressed that the "problems relate principally to the burden of debt in Maxwell Communication Corporation itself and do not diminish the underlying strengths of our world-class businesses." Another big question, of course, is how the banks will now fare. The banks had been estimating that they might have to write off 30 percent to 50 percent of their loans. Banks believed to have made loans to Maxwell Communication include: in France, Credit Lyonnais and Credit Agricole; in Britain, Lloyds, Barclays and Midland; Swiss Bank; Swiss Volksbank; Bank of Nova Scotia, and some Japanese banks.

HEADLINE: G.M. Woes Add to Pressure on Saturn

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN

 BODY:
Detroit's pronouncements ricochet around Spring Hill, Tenn., like bullets off a tin fence. On the other side of a knoll in the tiny town south of Nashville, the nation's No. 1 auto maker is feeling its way into the future of car manufacturing and trying -- sometimes fitfully, sometimes earnestly -- to shake off the sins of the past.
So it is not surprising that an ominous announcement from General Motors' headquarters last Wednesday raised tensions at G.M.'s Saturn factory. As the corporation braces for a major round of plant closings and layoffs at its 32 North American assembly plants, the pressure builds for Saturn to deliver on its promise to efficiently build high-quality cars and to teach G.M. the ways of the future. 
 "When I hear about G.M. layoffs it makes me that much more determined to make Saturn a great product," said Randy Sneed, a Saturn technician who teaches workers how to be more efficient and who had suffered through layoffs at other G.M. plants.
"Maybe for people who don't understand the situation, it will open their eyes," Mr. Sneed continued. "This really is our last chance. Some people who came down here haven't been laid off before. I'm not sure they were taking competition seriously."
For G.M., the competition is serious and so are the problems of the company, which has suffered from the recession and from a shrinking market share. Its plants, which can build 6.5 million to 7 million cars and light trucks a year, need to turn out only about 5 million vehicles for today's weak market -- a far cry from the corporate goal of achieving 100 percent capacity by 1993.
All that has G.M. hurtling toward a loss this year in the United States and Canada of up to $8 billion, its biggest ever.
As a consequence, a lot of people are watching the $3.5 billion Saturn experiment. When it was conceived in the early 1980's, G.M. vowed to do whatever it took to come up with the very best way to build cars.
Now, billions of dollars later and 13 months into production, Saturn is turning out nifty small coupes and sedans that draw praise from buyers, many of whom say they would otherwise have bought Japanese cars.
But the cars are not coming out of the factory as fast as G.M. had hoped. There are production problems, like the balky window cranks one day recently that trimmed output by 750 cars. There have been recalls for broken seat latches and for bad engine coolant.
All of that reflects the difficulties of a start-up manufacturing organization in which the work force and the product are new and the manufacturing rules are stricter than at other G.M. plants. In October, labor strife, which G.M. and the union had hoped to avoid in Spring Hill, flared briefly when workers realized that the number of defects in cars was ballooning. Thousands of workers, worried that quality was being sacrificed for greater output, donned armbands in a silent expression of their frustration when G.M.'s chairman, Robert C. Stempel, visited the plant.
Saturn executives do not appear panicked by the slow start-up or by any labor tension, and the fledgling division, seen as more laboratory than factory, will likely be spared in this latest G.M. retrenchment.
The bosses in Detroit have promised not to push Saturn for results too quickly. Saturn executives predict that output will improve steadily as factory-floor glitches are ironed out. With better output, the dealer network can be expanded, more cars can be sold and G.M. can inch closer to a payoff for this tremendously expensive project.
"We're always criticized for short-term thinking," said Don Hudler, Saturn's vice president of sales and dealer relations. "Profitability will come, but it's not most important right now."
 What G.M. thinks is important now is to sharpen its manufacturing skills. For years, experts said that American auto makers were neglecting manufacturing at their peril. Detroit took longer than the Japanese to build cars -- at one point 40 percent longer -- and the vehicles still turned out poorly. The American companies tried to automate parts of the assembly line with robots -- sometimes with disastrous results -- but the Japanese improved even more.
With Saturn, G.M. took a clean sheet of paper and attempted to redefine how American workers could make high-quality cars at low cost.
G.M. decided in 1985 to sink a fortune into a "different kind of car company," as Saturn advertises itself, and build a plant and a corporate culture in Tennessee.
 
'Lean' Production
 In the mid-1980's, researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology studied the Toyota Motor Corporation's production system, a profound departure from the mass-production technique of Henry Ford. Their findings, in a book entitled "The Machine That Changed the World," became gospel for Saturn engineers.
In essence, auto makers were taught to cut waste and inventory to a minimum, and to use workers' brains as well as their brawn. M.I.T. called it "lean" manufacturing. Other auto makers are superimposing "lean" principles on their current systems, while Saturn is an attempt to build an entire system around the concept.
According to the shop-floor gospel at Saturn, what is important is the nitty-gritty of machines. By training workers and honing basic skills, Toyota learned to make extremely precise parts with very little scrap, M.I.T. researchers discovered. In turn, reliability was increased and consumers were pleased.
In the case of balky car-door windows, for example, Saturn engineers could not immediately determine whether the window glass was the wrong size, the frame was built imprecisely or the handle mechanism was faulty.
 
 
Confronting Problems Quickly
 At traditional G.M. plants, workers might have concentrated on repairing individual windows, rather than on rooting out the cause of defects. An inventory of windows would be accumulated. In a "lean" system like Saturn's, every glitch is confronted instantly; until each problem is resolved, nothing further is manufactured. "When you bank parts, little problems tend to get ignored," said Robert Boruff, Saturn's vice president of manufacturing. "This way, we have no choice but to fix them." In the short run, of course, fewer cars are produced.
Longer-term, sharper skills result in swift, dependable production. Ideally, the "lean" factory comes to resemble an industrial ballet, where parts are built just as they are needed and quality is so high that inspection is virtually redundant.
To clear the way for an entirely new factory culture, G.M. thought it needed a new relationship with its hourly workers. Saturn's labor agreement with the United Automobile Workers union differs from the G.M. pacts at its other plants. At Saturn, workers receive constant training and are expected to participate in business decisions. One example: line workers who install taillights saved the company $650,000 by determining that the more costly deluxe lights were identical to the regular lights and could be dispensed with at great savings.
Saturn workers can still strike, and executives can still lay off workers, though both steps are regarded as remote possibilities.
And workers on the line tend to bridle any time they think engineers and managers are not attacking quality concerns aggressively enough. "They are very hard on their leaders," said Mike Bennett, president of the union. "They always want to know why things aren't fixed yet."
 
 
Defects Began to Rise
 Last summer, as negotiators began to bargain for the first-ever revisions to the Saturn labor contract, the number of defects per car started climbing. Workers were alarmed, Mr. Duncan said. Moreover, workers complained of increasing delays by engineers who fixed machines.
"Everyone was pushing themselves to insure quality," said Bill Betts, a Saturn spokesman. "The process wasn't working. People have to be able to assure quality, day-in and day-out, without tension and strain."
Union workers worried that bargaining over pay and benefits might have led to distractions and defects on the assembly line. "People had been excited about finally getting the chance to produce quality," said Mr. Sneed, the Saturn technician. "As time goes on, you can forget what the mission is."
Earl Ice, a Saturn assembly supervisor, who has observed Toyota's factory in Georgetown, Ky., said Saturn engineers should spend more time near the assembly line and be more available to production workers. About 500 Saturn engineers are stationed in Troy, Mich., a one-hour flight from Nashville. A spokesman said many engineers must use G.M.'s technical center and proving grounds near Detroit.
 
 
Faster Assembly Coming
 Experts point out that the faster the assembly line is moving, the harder it is to maintain quality. James Harbour, a manufacturing consultant, said, "Saturn's manufacturing processes should have been proven before the plant went into production."
Nevertheless, Mr. Ice said the current line speed of 50 cars an hour was scheduled to be increased to 68 cars an hour after the New Year. "The windows are running real slick now," he said, a week after engineers spotted and fixed several machines producing parts that differed slightly from specifications.
The final judgment on Saturn, which is probably years off, will be whether it can build cars of high quality and build them profitably. That should be decided when production finally hits its peak, and if the buyers are still attracted to the car. At that stage, G.M. may have the privilege and the headache of deciding whether to revamp all of its plants in Saturn's image.

HEADLINE: Washington Talk;
Happy End to Tale of Mass Transit Aid

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
On the same day in November that Congress promised to almost double spending on mass transportation, the Office of Management and Budget produced a memorandum proposing that it be cut nearly in half instead.
Poorly coordinated White House staff work? A devious maneuver intended to thwart the intent of Congress? 
 The answer hardly matters, promoters of mass transportation say. They expect Samuel K. Skinner, who became White House chief of staff today, to squash the suggestion quickly because he considers it both bad management and bad politics.
In his three years as Transportation Secretary, Mr. Skinner often felt the sharp knives of the budget director, Richard G. Darman, who routinely pared the Transportation Department's requests for mass transportation in the spending requests the White House sent to Congress each winter. The lawmakers routinely restored much of the money, but mass transportation hardly thrived. After accounting for inflation, Federal aid to the states for mass transportation was cut in half in the 1980's.
In the next six fiscal years, all that is supposed to change. Not only did the transportation bill, approved by Congress before Thanksgiving, set aside $32 billion for mass transportation through the 1998 fiscal year, it gave the states the power to shift some of their highway aid to bus and subway projects if they chose.
The White House was not happy with all the bill's provisions, especially its subsidies for mass transportation systems whose fares cannot cover daily operating expenses. But the Administration has embraced the bill as a powerful economic stimulus, and President Bush is set to sign it on Wednesday.
Local transportation agencies were just uncorking the champagne to celebrate the expected signing of the bill when they learned that the White House budget office was still playing Scrooge. The office wanted the Transportation Department to scale back its mass transportation request for the 1993 fiscal year, which begins next Oct. 1, to around $2 billion. This year's budget was $3.8 billion.
Jack R. Gilstrap, executive vice president of the American Public Transit Association, complained to the President last week, "I would be extremely disappointed to think that your Administration was preparing a budget that cuts funding for the Federal transit program at the same time that you are about to sign into law an act that emphasizes the importance of transit."
Brian Clymer, the administrator of the Urban Mass Transit Administration, set out to soothe those worried about the budget office memorandum.
"I think it is very much up in the air," Mr. Clymer said in an interview. "The executive review process is a lengthy one. We begin our budget in March, and it doesn't culminate for a couple of weeks yet."
The budget office's recommendation is "only one step," he continued. "I don't think that is by any stretch of the imagination the end game."
Such talk shows how confident Mr. Clymer must be that Mr. Skinner, who is now Mr. Darman's boss, will back him in the negotiations with Mr. Darman. After all, both Mr. Skinner and Mr. Clymer once headed major transportation agencies, in Chicago and Philadelphia, respectively.
The resolution of the immediate dispute notwithstanding, it appears that mass transportation spending will not be going up quite as fast as some had hoped in any case, at least not right away.
That is because the transportation measure that passed Congress last month was an authorization bill that sets policy and establishes broad spending outlines, and it must be followed by an appropriations bill that actually allows checks to be sent to the states.
And it is the appropriations that end up figuring in the Federal deficit and must comply with Governmentwide budget agreements.
"If I were a betting man, I would say you will probably not see a jump from $3.8 billion up to $5.2 billion or $5.3 billion," Mr. Clymer said. Instead, he suggested, spending might increase by about $400 million or $500 million next year.
"Am I optimistic it is going to go up?" he asked. "The answer is, yes."
But he noted, "I can't take authorizations to the bank."

HEADLINE: 6 in Search Of an Image;
Democrats Strain To Be Presidential

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
Republicans were chortling today over Sunday night's debate, asserting that the six major Democratic Presidential contenders, as a class, seemed unpresidential. When reporters asked President Bush who won the debate, he pointed to himself.
Republican smugness aside, the first major debate of the 1992 campaign showed that the Democrats are still learning how to use a critical shot at prime time. The group portrait was contentious at best, the individual performances varied widely, and no one seemed to make a significant break from the pack, in the view of many political professionals. 
 "When they write the 'Making of the President, 1992,' this debate won't get mentioned much," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic poll taker.
 
A Plus for Kerrey
 Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, widely seen in Democratic circles as an underachiever since he entered the race, was cited by many political professionals today as the candidate who most helped himself. Former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California was probably most successful in getting his message across, but some analysts suggested that the abrasive style of the messenger may negate the message.
In general, each of the candidates had to struggle against the limitations of the genre. "Multi-candidate debates are not a pretty sight," said Michael McCurry, an adviser to Senator Kerrey. "When you're up there with six people, trying to be distinctive and Presidential is not easy."
Kathleen Hall Jamieson, an expert on political communication at the University of Pennyslvania, said it was impossible to look Presidential on a stage with five other men, a 60-second cap on speech and a newscaster looming above the candidate. Lorraine Voles, press secretary to Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, said it "looked like a setup for the 'Newlywed Game.' "
Given that, each candidate entered the debate with his own strategic imperatives ---- some of which they achieved, some of which they did not.
Gov Bill Clinton of Arkansas was coming off a month of good reviews for speeches to Democratic audiences around the country. On Sunday, a few hours before the debate, Mr. Clinton had won a big victory in a straw poll at the Florida Democratic convention -- an event of symbolic importance only, but the kind that matters to political insiders and financial contributors.
 
Clinton Viewed as Low Key
 But the Governor's performance at the debate Sunday night was subdued, low key. His allies called it statesmanlike; his critics suggested he was trying too hard to seem Presidential.
"Somebody must have told him that he had to act Presidential and avoid the fray," said Bob Squier, a Democratic consultant. "if that's Presidential, he should go back to gubernatorial."
Still, Samuel Popkin, a political scientist at the University of California at San Diego, contended that Mr. Clinton and Mr. Harkin were much further along than their rivals in telling the public, in understandable ways, what they would do as President.
Sunday night's debate, which was sponsored by NBC News, was the first of seven nationally televised debates to be held among the major candidates for the Democratic candidates.
Mr. Kerrey has been widely viewed by political professionals as a charismatic candidate who has yet to deliver the goods in his Presidential campaign. In Sunday's debate he tried to introduce himself, and his life story, to the American public. Repeatedly, he cited his experiences as a Navy commando in Vietnam, where he lost his leg and won the Medal of Honor for heroism.
 
Sharp Exchange With Brown
 The Senator also engaged in perhaps the sharpest exchange of the night when he angrily challenged Mr. Brown on his repeated charges that America's politicains were in thrall to special interest money. "Are you saying I'm bought and paid for?" Mr. Kerrey demanded, while Mr. Brown blanched.
Like other analysts, Mr. Popkin gave Mr. Kerrey the edge in that exchange, contending that Mr. Brown "came across as a person who is lucky not to get punched out by some of the others."
Mr. Brown certainly succeeded in grabbing the mantle of the anti-establishment candidate out to rock the system, but some analysts suggested he did it a considerable cost. "He was far too intensne throughout this debate for television," Ms. Jamieson said.
Long plagued by a reputation that depicts him as "Governor Moonbeam," Mr. Brown may have only fed the image of eccentrity in Sunday night's debate, some analysts said.
Senator Harkin entered the debate with a reputation as a fire and brimstone orator with a firm control on traditional Democratic economics. Political professionals said he effectively stuck to his themes, which was not a small accomplishment in the free-wheeling atmosphere of Sunday night's debate. Former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts came across as thoughtful to many political professionals, but also non-telegenic.
Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia seemed to be making a concerted appeal for black votes, delivering an unstinting defense of civil rights generally and affirmative action in particular, and assailing the White House for fostering a poor racial climate.
Ronald H. Brown, the Democratic national chairman, described the debate as "a pretty good introduction to our candidates." By Friday, which isthe filing deadline for the New Hampshire primary, Democrats should know whether the next debate will include Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York.
With or without him, Democrats are moving into prime time. And with just nine weeks before New Hampshire, they have little time to adjust.

HEADLINE: Citing Bill of Rights, Bush Praises Limits On the Government

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ORANGE, Va., Dec. 16

 BODY:
In a speech commemorating the 200th anniversary of the Bill of Rights, amid references to high principle and power, President Bush today threaded his own election-year argument: that the principles of limited Government adopted by the Founding Fathers were reflected in the policies of the Bush Administration.
Speaking at Montpelier, the majestic hunt-country estate of President James Madison, the foremost drafter of the Bill of Rights, Mr. Bush made no explicit pitch for votes or blunt attacks on his Democratic challengers. His major point was that the Bill of Rights, the first 10 amendments to the Constitution, was not so much a declaration of freedoms as "a set of legally enforceable constraints" that set out "stark" limits on government power. 
 But along the way, Mr. Bush repeatedly suggested that Madison and other founders would frown on what he described as the liberal fiscal and legislative habits of today's Government.
He never explicitly mentioned the debate over a national health-care system or complaints about excessive Federal spending and Congressional perquisites, all of which have resonated with voters in elections and political speeches this fall. But at times his remarks appeared to be a veiled response to Democratic critics who had contended that the White House was not marshaling the vast powers of Government to help citizens in distress.
 
Arguing for Limits
 "The genius of the Bill of Rights is that it limits its attention to truly important things -- and to things over which a just and limited Government can exercise some actual control," Mr. Bush said. "Today one often hears the concept of rights attached to specific social services or material standards of living. The framers, however, did not elevate acquisition of even the most vital goods and services to the status of rights."
Rather, he said, Madison and others believed that the grant of freedom empowered people to take care of themselves, and that Government "pateralism is just a sugar-coated tyranny."
Mr. Bush also enlisted a foundation of Madison's philosophy -- the idea that political factions posed the greatest threat to stability in the infant Republic -- to argue that Congress's committee system is dominated by special-interest factions and should be dismantled.
As the President spoke to an audience of about 450 at Montpelier, his new chief of staff, Samuel K. Skinner, began his first day on the job with an upbeat speech to his staff in the White House. Mr. Skinner was said by White House officials to have told the staff that they would be working "day and night" to design a new economic-recovery program.
He also said that he expected to make few changes in a staff inherited from his predecessor, John H. Sununu.
"A great burden has been lifted," one official, who refused to be identified, said of Mr. Skinner's arrival. "It's a breath of fresh air."

HEADLINE: Nassau Board Votes Budget Of Austerity

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., Dec. 16

 BODY:
The Nassau County Board of Supervisors, in a sweeping repudiation of both higher taxes and the incumbent County Executive, adopted a budget today that sharply curtailed spending and called for thousands of layoffs.
The $1.9 billion budget eliminated $122 million, three-quarters of a tax increase proposed by the County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, last month, but at the expense of programs and amenities that residents of this affluent suburb have come to take for granted. 
 Recreation programs, including the county's free concerts and its puppetmobile, are likely to be eliminated, money for senior centers has been cut, health clinic hours will be reduced and officials at the county's medical center warned that it would have to shut down wards and clinics.
 
'Deepening Economic Depression'
 Joseph N. Mondello, the board's Republican majority leader, said that the cuts were the all but inevitable product of a "deepening economic depression" that left many suburban families unable to pay ever-rising taxes and "in severe economic peril, unable to put food on the table."
"From every town and every community of this great county, a clear and unequivocal message is resonating: the people of this county must have tax relief," he said. "Many county services will undoubtedly cease to exist, and others will be scaled back significantly."
As he spoke, the County Executive looked on glumly. Both he and Mr. Mondello wore blue ribbons in their lapels, a symbol of a growing tax revolt movement in the county.
Mr. Gulotta did not speak during the meeting and did not meet with reporters afterward. He issued a two-paragraph statement saying that the budget was "in many respects better than the one that was originally proposed."
But he warned that it could produce a deficit and damage the county's credit rating, and he pledged to "implement additional and more dramatic cuts" throughout the year.
One aide to Mr. Gulotta said that this could eventually result in the layoff of as many as 4,000 of the county's 17,000 employees. In a gibe that is a staple of politics here, he added: "It is a Brooklyn budget. It will result in a quality of service comparable to that in New York City."
The new budget was put together by Mr. Mondello, who is also the Republican county leader, and other Republican members on the board over the last few weeks after Mr. Gulotta, also a Republican, proposed a budget that raised property taxes 25 percent and imposed a new sales tax on home heating oil.
The two increases proposed by Mr. Gulotta would have raised taxes on an average homeowner by about $400 a year, on top of an earlier steep increase in school taxes. The proposals caused a revolt both by Democrats, who have long complained of "bloated" spending by Republicans who have controlled the Legislature for 75 years, and by Republicans, who found themselves on the defensive.
As the board convened today before hundreds of people packed in the Board of Supervisors' room here, while county fire marshals kept others out, the Democrats presented a plan that would roll back only a third of the proposed county tax increases -- then quickly tabled their motion when they learned that the Republicans were proposing much deeper cuts in spending.
"They did a good job in cutting, but unfortunately it did not go far enough," said Gregory P. Peterson, a Republican supervisor from the Town of Hempstead.
 
Abstaining on Their Own Plan
 The two Democrats on the board, Benjamin L. Zwirn, the supervisor of the Town of North Hempstead, and Bruce Nyman, the Democratic Mayor of Long Beach, abstained on their own budget proposal, saying they needed more time to perfect it.
Instead the board adopted the Republican plan along party lines. It eliminated the tax on home heating oil and reduced the property tax increase to 9 percent, or $76 for a typical family.
To accomplish this, it cut spending by $122 million, or 6 percent. But with most of the budget going to essential services or those mandated by law, like welfare, police and corrections, the cuts fell far deeper in other areas.
But in making their reductions, the Republicans on the board deeply undermined the authority of the Republican County Executive and reduced the expensive services that have provided patronage jobs and won the loyalty of Nassau County voters.
Peter King, the Republican Nassau County Comptroller, said that personnel costs in most agencies would be cut by 22 percent under the budget. Spending on county purchases, printing, postage, consulting fees and library subsidies would be trimmed.
 
Culture and Development
 Grants to cultural groups and spending on economic development, county museums and recreation programs would be cut in half, along with county spending on senior centers and community services.
The board, using legislative prerogative, simply wrote in $65 million in personnel cuts and left it for the County Executive to fill in the details. Among the choices, the board said that the layoff of 800 part-time workers, 377 temporary full-time workers and 350 seasonal workers, along with 1,000 regular county employees, would save the $65 million.
Dr. Tracy E. Strevey Jr., executive director of Nassau County Medical Center, said the new budget would eliminate all county subsidies for the hospital, including the $15 million it provided last year to pay for the care for the poor.
"I know of no other public hospital cast loose by its government," he said. He said that it could lead to the closing of 30 to 150 patient beds.

HEADLINE: Supreme Court Roundup;
Court Rules Reservists in Training Have Unlimited Job Leave

BYLINE: By LINDA GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
The Supreme Court ruled today that military reservists and National Guard members who entered full-time military training programs were legally entitled to unlimited leaves of absence from their civilian jobs.
Voting 8 to 0, the Court overturned a ruling by a Federal appeals court that Congress had implicitly required such leaves to be of "reasonable" duration. That decision, issued in 1990 by the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit in Atlanta, held that a Birmingham, Ala., hospital could reject as "unreasonable" a Guarsdman's request for a three-year leave of absence to serve in a full-time position as Alabama's top enlisted Guardsman. 
 In an opinion today by Justice David H. Souter, the Supreme Court said the Federal law that protected the civilian jobs of those in military service was "utterly silent abut any durational limit on the protection it provides."
The law at issue, the Veterans' Re-employment Rights Act, requires employers to grant reservists and National Guard members leaves of absence "for the period required to perform active duty for training or inactive duty training in the armed forces of the United States."
The decision today does not apply to reservists who are called to active duty by Presidential order, like those men and women who were sent to the Persian Gulf. They are protected by another section of the law guaranteeing a four-year leave.
The case today applies to those who serve in special training programs that require full-time duty of six months to three years. Some 45,000 reservists and National Guard members are currently on such tours of "active duty for training."
Federal courts were split over the re-employment rights of those seeking extended leaves under these programs. Three Federal appellate circuits had concluded that the statute implicitly incorporated a "reasonableness" requirement, while another ruled last year that it did not.
The Federal Government, arguing that it was essential to enable people to serve in the special training programs "free from economic insecurity," represented the Alabama guardsman whose leave was at issue. William (Sky) King, a hospital administrator, was a 35-year veteran of the Alabama Guard when he sought appointment as command sergeant major, the top enlisted position in the state Guard.
This position requires a three-year tour of full-time duty. Mr. King's employer, St. Vincent's, went to Federal court for a ruling on whether it was obliged under law to honor his request.
Justice Clarence Thomas did not participate in the case, King v. St. Vincent's Hospital, No. 90-889, which was argued in October, before he joined the Court.
Other decisions at the Court today included these:
 
Restrictions on Aliens
 The Court unanimously upheld an Immigration and Naturalization Service regulation, adopted in 1983, that bars aliens who are facing deportation proceedings from obtaining "unauthorized employment."
As interpreted by the Court today in an opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens, the regulation means that aliens who are arrested and threatened with deportation may not hold jobs during a temporary period of release from custody if they do not have green cards or other authorization to work.
The decision, I.N.S. v. National Center for Immigrants' Rights, No. 90-1090, overturned a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in California. That court interpreted the regulation more broadly as applying even to aliens who had work authorization, and invalidated the regulation as unauthorized by law.
 
Safety Regulation
 Accepting an appeal by the State of Illinois, the Court agreed to decide whether states have the discretion, without prior Federal approval, to issue regulations that protect both public health and worker safety at hazardous waste sites.
The safety of workers at such locations is regulated by a Federal agency, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Under principles of Federal pre-emption, a state may issue more stringent job safety regulations only after first submitting its plan for the Federal agency's review.
In this case, Gade v. National Solid Wastes Management Assoc., No. 90-1676, Illinois sought to protect not only worker safety but public health in the vicinity of hazardous waste sites, a goal that is not part of the Federal agency's mandate. The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago, ruled that "dual purpose" state regulations of this type were also pre-empted.
 
Drug Testing
 Without comment, the Court refused to hear a constitutional challenge to the Justice Department's drug-testing policy, under which lawyers tentatively accepted for employment with the department must submit to a urinalysis.
The challenge was brought by a lawyer, Carl Willner, who had tentatively been offered a job in the department's antitrust division. After the department refused to waive the rule, Mr. Willner sued on the ground that the test, in the absence of any suspicion of drug use, was an unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth Amendment.
Judge Gerhard A. Gesell of Federal District Court here agreed, declaring the test unconstitutional. But the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit overturned that ruling in a 2-to-1 decision, with Judge A. Raymond Randolph stating in the majority opinion, "If individuals view drug testing as an indignity to be avoided, they need only refrain from applying" for a job at the Justice Department.
Mr. Willner's appeal was Willner v. Barr, No. 91-448.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers' Constituents Complain About Economy, and Congress Itself

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
When Representative Rick Santorum went back to his constituents in a Pittsburgh suburb last week, he heard an angry message that politicians were indifferent to American workers and not tough enough on foreign competition.
In western Massachusetts, Representative Richard E. Neal was told that scared bankers and timid regulators were blocking the commercial loans that might give the economy a lift. 
 Representative Tim Roemer went home to northern Indiana and heard complaints that deficit spending seemed to accomplish little beyond increasing the national debt and the interest payments on it.
The greetings that members of Congress usually get these days when they go home to meet the voters are gripes about the economy. Local circumstances and political styles change the emphasis, but as they return to their districts, lawmakers are confronted with an underlying message of economic concern at least as likely to affect legislation here next year as anything said in hearings in the Senate Finance Committee or the House Ways and Means Committee.
 
Pressure for Action
 Sometimes the voters, or the lawmakers, offer specific solutions to the problems raised, like tariffs on Japanese cars, or a "Marshall Plan" to revitalize the American economy. But there is also occasional pressure for action of almost any kind from the President and Congress.
"Just doing something will give people more confidence," Greg Chase, president of a concrete company, told Mr. Neal, a Democrat, in Mr. Chases's office in East Brookfield on Thursday.
Complaints about Congress itself are frequent fare, and the complaints come from both sides. Mr. Roemer, a Democrat, insists that Congress needs change and scorns pork-barrel spending. Mr. Santorum, a Republican, attacks his colleagues, saying that "most Congressmen don't want their people to know what they're doing," especially how they vote.
Here is what these three junior members of the House have been hearing in their districts.
 
Richland Township, Pa.
Sense of Losing The Trade War
 The economic issue that angered Representative Santorum's constituents on Wednesday was trade, most of all trade with Japan and the American jobs lost in the process.
Town meetings, with residents invited by official mail, are a typical way members of Congress meet constitutents, and the freshman Republican held his 46th of the year in the municipal building here. The audience was dotted with men in windbreakers identifying the shrinking industrial giants they now or once worked for: U.S. Steel, Westinghouse, and PPG.
"Congress can't enact any legislation to balance the trade deficit with Japan," complained J. Alder Erikson, who was wearing a PPG jacket.
 
'We're in a Trade War'
 Another who attended the meeting, John Antantis, voiced this complaint: "There's no more $14- or $15-an-hour jobs for American workers."
Howard Fahnestock came with complaints and proposals. He said politicians were "cavalier about the plight of the working man" and insisted: "We're in a trade war. We've been in one for 20 years, and we're losing it."
When he demanded "immediately impose tariffs on Japanese automobiles," someone shouted "don't forget the Germans."
The only aspect of the trade issue that drew a detailed response from Mr. Santorum was criticism of his vote for expedited trade negotiations with Mexico. George Skillness asserted, "You're going to take jobs away from American workers." Mr. Santorum insisted he would vote against the free-trade treaty if the Bush Administration came back to Congress with a bad one, but said, "I don't think we can put walls around the United States and say we won't deal with Mexico."
He told them he favored an economic growth package, one that used capital gains tax cuts to expand the economy. He scorned Democrats for complaining that the benefits of such a cut went to the wealthy, saying, "This wasn't supposed to be and isn't supposed to be a fair tax program; what it's supposed to be is something to get the economy and more jobs created."
 
Blaming Bush and Congress
 Mr. Santorum is a follower of Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia, the House Republican whip who pressed the tax issue just before Congress adjourned, regardless of the White House's lack of enthusiasm.
Mr. Santorum criticized President Bush over that diffidence. He said: "I blame the President as much as I blame the Congress. The President was as indecisive as the leaders of the Congress."
But he offered the 50 constituents at the meeting little hope for wise Congressional action. He scoffed at Congress for efforts to "embarrass the President" and an "unwillingness to face the issues that people really were talking about in America, such as the economy, such as health care, such as the budget deficit."
 
Springfield, Mass.
Where Bank Failed, Tight Money Hurts
 In western Massachusetts, the economic enemy whom Representative Neal's constitutents worry about is not overseas but down at the corner: their local banker.
Tom Schmitt, an electrical contractor, told Mr. Neal today that "nobody can get any money" for construction. John Bolduc, head of the local real estate brokers group, said, "Builders today can't go out and buy land and borrow to build a subdivision."
In East Brookfield, Mr. Chase, president of Chase Precut Concrete, told the second-term Democrat, "We seem to be spending 30 to 40 percent of our management time trying to do something that will be acceptable to the bankers." And Richard Chabot, who runs an auto body shop, said, "A lot of banks are in such serious trouble they don't want to hear anything commercial whatever."
The problem is that banks here are short of money and are refusing to renew commercial loans, even to customers who have always paid on time.And as real estate values have fallen, so did the value of the collateral that borrowers once posted to back loans, and immediate payment is now being demanded of some of those loans.
Mr. Neal has argued here and in the House Banking Committee that Federal regulators have overreacted to the failure of the Bank of New England and are now too severe in their standards for classifying loans. He contends that the economy is being hurt when customers who make their payments on time are still having loans canceled.
A lot of people are out of work in Mr. Neal's district. An old friend, John Collins, business manager of Local 7 of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, told him that about 200 of the local's 650 members were jobless.
In past recessions, he said, they could always find work out of state, but construction is slow "and there's no work in the whole United States," he said. The union has been collecting surplus food, but many members are too proud to take the handouts.
Wherever he went, Mr. Neal was told that besides encouraging loans from the bankers the Government had to take action to stimulate the economy.
There was no consensus on what should be done. Mr. Collins wanted a tax cut to help the middle class. Mr. Bolduc said almost any decisive action would spur confidence. So did Mr. Chase. And Mr. Neal observed, "The idea of a tax cut seems irresistible at this point."
But the attitude of banks was seen as the biggest problem. "If a viable business in the Springfield area wants to expand, they won't, because they can't get the money," said Mr. Bolduc.
And at the Quaboag Corporation, a shoe company in East Brookfield, Herbert Varnum, the chairman, said bankers' demands were forcing him to change the way he wanted to run the company. He said he was being required to keep a smaller inventory than he thought sound. " 'Friendly banker' is an oxymoron these days," he said.
 
Middlebury, Ind.
Calls for Changes In U.S. Spending
 Representative Roemer, the Democrat who won back this northern Indiana district in 1990 after it spent a decade in Republican hands, hears very little about tax cuts. But deficit spending bothers his voters.
"The budget just goes up and up," James Ebersol complained Friday at a town meeting here. "And every day that our Congress is in business the deficit goes up one billion dollars."
Mr. Roemer sympathized, said he favored a constitutional amendment to require a balanced budget and added that he had voted against popular spending measures.
At an earlier town meeting in nearby Bristol, Gunnar Erikson asked: "When you talk with your colleagues, don't they get the same story: that people want to know what they're going to do about the deficit? The 15 percent we're paying for interest would pay for so many things" if it did not have to go to service the debt.
 
Fears on Assembly Line
 But ending the budget deficit was not the only message about government spending. On the noisy assembly line at EWI Inc., an automobile stamping plant in South Bend, workers asked if he might be able to steer any Government contracts their way.
EWI is a 300-worker success story. The plant was about to be closed last spring when Mr. Roemer and state and city officials arranged its sale to an out-of-state investor and members of the United Automobile Workers took a pay cut to get a new start for the factory, whose huge stamping presses date from 1944 when Studebaker was building an amphibious vehicle called the Weasel.
The plant's immediate success is shadowed by fears for the future, and that typifies much of the economy of this district. There are victories, like a new headquarters for National Steel, and setbacks, like the closing of a Uni
royal tire plant and fears for the health insurance of retirees.
Mr. Roemer told several audiences today that the solution to long-term economic ills, not just for this district but the nation, was a domestic Marshall Plan to revive the economy. An eager supporter of the rather general proposal of Representative Ray Thornton, Democrat of Arkansas, Mr. Roemer said such a long-range development plan was vastly preferable to a "quick fix" tax cut.
Recalling the rebuilding of post-war Europe that was proposed by Secretary of State George C. Marshall in 1949, Mr. Roemer said such a plan would have three elements. One would be "education, so that we get the best trained work force."
A second element would be "transportation, rebuilding highways and bridges so we can transport our commerce and our goods and our people."
Third, the plan would help "our businesses get access to capital to modernize and retool and keep pace in an international environment" to compete with the Japanese and the Germans.
Asked later how he could both balance the budget and finance such a domestic plan, he said the balanced budget might have to wait.

HEADLINE: Damascus Journal;
Fist May Be of Iron, but Is Assad's Hand Weak?

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DAMASCUS, Syria

 BODY:
At nightfall a huge lighted sign, perched on Kassioun Mountain overlooking Damascus, blinks on with the message, "Congratulations to the People."
The newest addition to the capital's landscape celebrates the results of a recent referendum that gave President Hafez al-Assad 99.9 percent of the vote, extending his 21-year rule by seven more years. 
 Syria has been convulsed by campaign frenzy and victory celebrations for the last few weeks, although there is no legal opposition and voters were able to check only "yes" or "no" to the President's continued rule on ballots marked under the watchful eye of Government officials.
Schoolchildren have been let out of class and Government employees from offices to march through the streets. Banners and strings of carnival lights hang from the shops, and pictures of the President are plastered throughout the city.
"The whole effort is aimed at sanctifying the system and the President," said Jamal Atassi, a former Cabinet minister and one of the few critics of the Government who is willing to be quoted by name. "Those who rule this totalitarian state see the people as objects to be manipulated, and they use these spectacles to justify their hold on power."
 
Assad's Reign in Trouble
 But underneath the carefully staged euphoria the reign of President Assad is in trouble. Stripped of his old patron the Soviet Union, mired in a centralized economy that is grinding to a halt, dependent on a security apparatus that is widely hated and unable to check rampant corruption, the Government has adopted the tactics of its discredited Soviet-bloc mentors to justify its legitimacy, rather than the democratic reforms demanded by its Western critics.
The Syrians hope to mend their relations with the United States and get their name off the State Department's list of countries that sponsor terrorism, a move that would qualify them for American aid for the first time since the list was created in 1979.
The Government played a supporting role in the release of Western hostages in Lebanon, sent troops to the Persian Gulf in the war against Iraq, has taken part in the Middle East peace talks and expelled some notorious terrorists, including the man known as Carlos, who diplomats believe may have taken refuge in Baghdad. The Government does still harbor the Nazi war criminal Alois Brunner.
The country's abysmal human rights record, which includes total control of the press and the refusal to permit internal opposition, as well as continuing support for a wide variety of militant groups, including radical Palestinian factions, makes any reconciliation soon unlikely. The State Department's report on human rights says, "Syria is ruled by an authoritarian regime which does not hesitate to use force against its citizens when it feels it is threatened."
 
Constant Political Propaganda
 The Government uses everything from the army to schools to pound home its political propaganda.
The Ibn Khaldoon Boys High School is a cavernous building with 1,285 students. The students, dressed in olive green army fatigues, sit in classrooms adorned with pictures of the President and posters with his sayings.
For one hour a day they are given "political" lectures on the triumphs of the ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party and its leader, President Assad. The state-mandated curriculum includes books that teach children as young as 12 how to dismantle automatic weapons and highlights what are described as great moments in Middle East history, including the 1983 suicide bombing by pro-Iranian Shiite Muslims in Beirut that killed 241 American servicemen.
"The boys put these pictures up because of their love for the President," Mohammed Tishir Refi, the 60-year-old principal, said as he stood in a junior-year physics class adorned with over a dozen pictures of President Assad.
But his comment brought visible smirks and a few low chuckles.
"Most of us want to get out of the country," a student said. "We dream about going abroad."
The Baath Party is dominated by Mr. Assad's tiny Alawite sect, which embraces 11 percent of the population and is an offshoot of Shiite Islam. Family members, including Mr. Assad's son Basil, who has been designated the heir apparent, and other members of the sect control the military, internal security, the party and many of the trading monopolies.
 
'Free Hand' for Corruption
 Party bureaucrats travel about the capital in gleaming new Mercedes and BMW cars. They have private planes and expansive villas.
"The public has no say and no real knowledge of the inner workings of the regime," said the 69-year-old French-educated Mr. Atassi, a psychiatrist whose car was bombed and passport revoked and who lost his university post after he broke with the party in 1973. "This gives the bureaucrats a free hand to engage in corruption."
About 60 percent of the country's 12.5 million people are under 20, and few have many prospects for jobs. The Government already employs 40 percent of the workforce.
The growing number of alienated youths are often faced with only two possibilities, emigration or allegiance to the Muslim fundamentalists, who mounted an armed rebellion in Hama in 1982 that saw Syrian forces kill some 10,000 people.
"The mosques," a professor said, "are keeping their doors open for these people to file in."
 
Battle Cries Grow Wearisome
 For now the Government is tightly held in place by an extensive secret-police network that includes perhaps a dozen different intelligence agencies. The Government still spends 60 percent of the national budget on the military and state security, although it has abandoned its goal of achieving military parity with Israel.
The struggle against Israel remains the official raison d'etre for the iron-fisted control, used to explain the continued detention of some 7,000 political prisoners and even the shortages of basic goods.
But although most Syrians have little love for the Israelis, they have grown tired of the constant battle cries.
"We want to stop hearing every day about Israeli aggression," a 30-year-old professional woman said, "and start hearing about Syria."

HEADLINE: Tumult Tearing Yugoslavia Is Echoed In Serbs and Croats of Chicago Area

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Dec. 12

 BODY:
When the Rev. Mark Kozina arrived in the United States 40 years ago, he entered a Franciscan seminary "to forgive and forget" the miseries he experienced in wartime Yugoslavia, above all the execution by Serbian forces of his father, a Croatian soldier accused of complicity in atrocities committed by the Nazi collaborators who ruled Croatia in Hitler's stead.
Now, at 58 years of age, Father Kozina struggles with a bad heart and with a Roman Catholic parish in a South Chicago neighborhood where Mexican, Polish and Italian immigrants outnumber the shrinking Croatian community that settled there in the 1890's. In addition, the priest has contended for years with the social and economic fallout from the rusting steel mills, mostly silent now, that dominate the industrial wasteland running down Interstate 90 as it curls around Lake Michigan toward the Illinois-Indiana state line. 
 But for Father Kozina and others in Slag Valley, the nickname this community took in the heyday of Big Steel, the heaviest anxieties these days are rooted far away, in the renewed eruption of ethnic hatreds in Yugoslavia. By some estimates there are more than two million Americans with origins in the warring Yugoslav republics of Croatia and Serbia. One of the largest communities, perhaps as many as 300,000 people divided about equally between the two groups, lives in and around Chicago.
 
Some Mixed Reactions
 For some Americans with links to Yugoslavia, the resonance of the killing and destruction in cities and towns like Dubrovnik and Vukovar has been muted, summoning up a dimly remembered history of ethnic and religious bloodshed. For others, particularly those who still have relatives in the areas under fire, the death and destruction have brought an outpouring of recrimination.
For Father Kozina, whose widowed mother and three sisters remain in Croatia, this has meant reconciling Christian teachings on forgiveness with his, and his parishioners', more personal feelings.
"God, do you listen? Are you there?" the priest recalled asking in a sermon this month at the Sacred Heart Croatian Church, set amid the modest frame and brick homes clustered along the bleak streets of Slag Valley. "How long will it take for you to wake up and see the suffering of the Croatian people?"
The steel centers of Pittsburgh and Cleveland and Chicago drew the main wave of Croatian and Serbian immigrants before and after World War I, creating mixed communities like the one in Slag Valley, where families with roots on both sides of the current conflict live side by side and use some of the same schools and stores. Increasingly in recent years, Serbs and Croatians have intermarried.
 
A Renewal of Bitterness
 But here and elsewhere, much of the harmony has fractured. Serbian-owned stores and restaurants that relied on business from Croatians have been shunned, and vice versa. In many cases, bitterness has welled up in people who thought themselves too American to be stirred by passions that dominated earlier generations.
"I used to think my parents were a little too excited by the whole thing," said Anka Popovich, a 41-year-old American-born speech pathologist who is a spokesman for the St. Sava Cultural Club, an organization supported by many Serbians in Chicago. "When I was a kid, I used to look at my parents and think, 'What are they shouting about?' Now I'm just as excited as they ever were."
Across the Chicago area, Serbians and Croatians have established round-the-clock communications networks. They stay up late into the night monitoring shortwave radio broadcasts from Yugoslavia, and some even use backyard satellite dishes to tune in television transmissions from Zagreb, the Croatian capital, and from Belgrade, the headquarters of Yugoslav and Serb forces. Bulletins on the fighting are circulated by fax machines and debated feverishly at meetings in church halls and cultural centers.
Convinced that the United States can decisively affect the outcome, both sides have produced a blizzard of glossy pamphlets and impassioned statements aimed at persuading Washington to tilt one way or the other in the dispute. Congressmen and editorial writers have been invited to delve deep into Balkan history, a maze that runs from the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires through Tito and the anti-communist Chetniks in Yugoslavia during World War II.
 
Debate Over Independence
 But the object of much of the argument has been Croatia's declaration of independence, which precipitated some of the harshest fighting after it was announced in June.
For now, the Bush Administration has refused to recognize the Croatian breakaway, signaling a preference for Yugoslavia's survival. Croatian Americans accuse Washington of a double standard for its readiness to recognize Ukraine and other breakaway Soviet republics, but not Croatia. Serbian Americans are heartened by the Administration's policy, and insist that Croatia must surrender large tracts of territory that are home to the 600,000 Serbians who live in Croatia.
"If Croatia has the democratic right to secede from Yugoslavia, surely our people have the same right to secede from Croatia," said Jelena Raskovitch, a 24-year-old economics graduate of Northwestern University who has written letters to President Bush and other political leaders urging them not to be influenced by what she regards as a pro-Croatian bias in the news media.
Militants have gone beyond the battle for American minds, injecting ugly undertones into the struggle. Earlier this month vandals daubed Croatian nationalist symbols and Nazi slogans on the walls of the Holy Resurrection Serbian Orthodox Cathedral on Chicago's North Side, the third time in months that a Serbian church in the Chicago area had been attacked. People active on both sides have reported menacing telephone calls, smashed windows and sudden, angry outbursts from strangers in subway trains, buses and banks.
Some have sought more direct involvement in the war. In August, four Croatian men from the Chicago area were arrested in Miami in what the authorities said was a conspiracy to buy $12 million of American arms, including Stinger antiaircraft missiles. Federal agents suggested that the conspiracy was part of a broader effort at illicit gun-running, but Croatians insist that picnics, banquets and church bingo games held across the country in recent months have been dedicated solely to financing shipments of humanitarian aid.
Among Serbians, the Miami arrests are cited as evidence of an endemic violence among Croatians. "Everybody knows about Auschwitz and Buchenwald," said George Bogdanich, 43, a Chicago public relations consultant, "but not about Jasenovac," a World War II death camp run by Croatia's Nazi rulers.
Croatians contend that smuggled weapons are essential in the fight against the Serbian-controlled Yugoslav Army. "Everybody is trying to get arms in there; the Serbs are trying it and so are we," said a Chicagoan with Croatian nationalist links. "You can't fight a modern army with sticks and rosary beads."
In Slag Valley the militancy is muted, perhaps because the majority of Croatian and Serbian residents are second- and third- generation Americans. But strains are evident. The principal Serbian church in the district, St. Archangel Michael's of the Eastern Orthodox rite, lies only five blocks from Father Kozina's church. But the Croatian priest has yet to meet the new pastor of the Serbian church, the Rev. Milos Vesin, who arrived from Switzerland 18 months ago. Father Vesin said he had tried several times to set up a meeting.
In some Slag Valley families such estrangements are dismissed as petty. Jack and Nadine Golich are one of the area's "mixed couples" -- he is a 38-year-old Croatian American who operates a garbage truck, she is a 30-year-old Serbian American who designs floral arrangements. Their son, Jake, 7, jokes over whether he is more Croatian or Serbian.
Over coffee in the couple's living room, Mrs. Golich shook her head at the feuding between the two communities. "We never grew up that way -- you hate the Croatians, you hate the Serbians," she said. "We consider ourselves Americans."

HEADLINE: Bit by Bit, More Gifts To Neediest

BYLINE: By J. PEDER ZANE

 BODY:
The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund recorded more than $100,000 in contributions yesterday, the first time it has reached that level since the 80th annual appeal began on Thanksgiving Day.
The $100,850 in new donations pushed the total amount of contributions to just under $1.6 million. After a slow start, collections for this year's appeal is just $59,000 behind the pace of last year, when a record $4.4 million was raised. 
 Although charitable organizations and public corporations have provided many donations, most of the money has come from private individuals, many of whom have increased their contributions despite the decline in the economy.
"I have donated far more to charities this year than ever before, despite the fact that my own income is not what it was five years ago," Shelia Maris Reilly of Middletown, R.I., wrote in a note with her $25 donation. "There are so many needy people today, and far less in the way of government-supplied resources, that it is entirely necessary and appropriate for every working person with a little to spare to contribute."
 
'I See a Greater Need'
 Lawrence B. Morris Jr. of Darien, Conn., said his $250 donation represented a 25 percent increase over last year's. In making his 45th annual contribution to the fund, David Judson of Manhattan increased his gift 50 percent over last year's, to $300, because, he said: "I see a greater need for help at a time when a lot of people who might contribute are having to cut back. I don't have to. Hope this idea can be extended to others."
Since it was founded in 1912 by Adolph S. Ochs, who was publisher of The Times, the Neediest Cases Fund has raised money for New York's sick, poor and disabled. What began as the Hundred Neediest Cases has expanded to meet the needs of thousands of people.
As in the past, The Times is covering all of the campaign's overhead so that every dollar collected can be passed directly to seven charities. The money provides many forms of relief, including food for the hungry, homes for the homeless and clothing for those without. The seven charities also use the money to provide job training for the disabled, counseling for drug and alcohol abusers and child abusers and services that address the problems confronted by the victims of AIDS.
As George Ginsberg of Springfield, N.J., noted in a letter with his check, the money for these services comes a dollar at a time. "Last year I contributed the small sum of $3," he wrote. "While this year gave me no windfall, I notice our economy is no better. In fact, I dare say it is worse. So it is only natural that the needy will suffer more. Therefore I felt the least I could was double my contribution. So here is $6."
He continued: "If what I have done could be duplicated by the small contributors like myself, that would help. Let us small givers take care of the small donations and the biggies will take care of themselves."
