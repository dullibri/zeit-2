HEADLINE: I.M.F. and World Bank Blueprint

 BODY:
More than half a century after their creation, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank could use some fresh thinking about their operations. Thanks to a Congressional commission that unveiled its recommendations about the institutions yesterday, there are some bold new ideas to consider. Some of the suggestions are ill conceived, but others deserve serious consideration by the United States and other nations that belong to the two organizations.
One of the biggest and best ideas in the report is a call to cancel the crushing debt of the world's poorest countries. If the commission does nothing else but spur the United States and its allies to get behind this plan, it will have accomplished a lot. 
 The 11-member, bipartisan commission voted unanimously to strip the I.M.F. of all but one task: extending emergency loans to countries whose currencies come under attack. The job of fighting poverty would be turned over to the World Bank. This is a sound idea that would produce a clearer division of responsibilities.
The commission would end the current practice of making I.M.F. bailouts contingent on the acceptance of strict and sometimes harmful economic policies dictated by the fund after a country falls into financial crisis. Instead the fund would require countries to qualify for future loans by opening up their banking systems and taking other steps that could help prevent a crisis. This would have the added advantage of allowing the fund to react more quickly when trouble develops.
These recommendations are constructive, but go too far. Countries that do not pre-qualify for assistance would be unable to get loans in a crisis. A less drastic reform would allow the fund to extend loans to wayward countries, but at a higher interest rate. The report also errs in limiting emergency loans to eight months. Neither of these defects would be hard to fix.
As for the World Bank, the commission would justifiably eliminate lending to countries whose credit ratings permit them to tap private capital markets. It would concentrate the bank's money on fighting poverty in the world's 80 or so poorest countries. The commission also recommends that the bank use grants rather than loans to pay for its programs. To vaccinate children, for example, the bank would solicit bids and pay for the vaccines itself as they are actually delivered. The idea is to reduce corruption and waste. Switching to grants would require more money from the donor countries -- which the report strongly advocates. This may be possible, but is far from assured.
Congress is not expected to act on the report soon. But some politicians are already denouncing the commission, wrongly, for dismantling the I.M.F. and the World Bank. The danger is that political squabbling will squander an opportunity for Democrats and Republicans to reach an important agreement. The I.M.F. and World Bank need to sharpen their focus and improve their programs. The first step toward these goals is to lift the debts that keep desperately poor countries trapped in poverty.

HEADLINE: Greenspan's Choice

 BODY:

To the Editor:
A March 6 editorial attempts to justify the determination of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, to raise interest rates to slow the economy to prevent inflation. Monetary policy is, however, the wrong way to go about it.
The time lag before interest rate adjustments take effect raises the possibility that the economy will slow down more than is necessary. Higher interest rates raise costs and contribute to inflation and also have a dampening effect on the investments that permit the growth of the economy and its productivity. 
 A better alternative would be to increase the progressivity of the income tax to siphon off the excess income that Mr. Greenspan is concerned about. This would accomplish his goal without jeopardizing employment and causing pain to the most vulnerable members of the labor force. The progressive income tax, recognized by economists as a built-in stabilizer, also would slow the growth in income disparity.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: Market Place;
All Tech All the Time Tells Only One Side of the Story

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
Is it still a bull market if it is running on only one leg?
That is the question investors are asking today as they ponder a badly bifurcated stock market, where a handful of strong stocks are surrounded by a mass of the weak. 
 While most bull markets are built on strong performance from a wide swath of industries, gains in the current market are being made in technology stocks alone. Procter & Gamble's profit warning on Tuesday only served to cement the view among investors that anything nontech is a nonstarter.
Although it is not immediately evident from the behavior of the broad market indexes, most shares are currently trading at bear market levels. While the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is down about 7 percent for the year, more than three-quarters of the stocks in the index are down 20 percent or more from their recent highs, according to Salomon Smith Barney.
Even more surprising is data compiled by James Paulsen, chief investment officer at Wells Capital Management in Minneapolis. Mr. Paulsen found that if he excises the 66 technology and telecommunications stocks from the S.& P. index, the 434 companies that remain are currently trading at the same low levels seen during the Russian debt crisis of 1998. With technology and telecommunications back in the index, it is up approximately 40 percent since then.
In addition, Mr. Paulsen removed technology stocks from the S.& P. index and found that the price-to-earnings ratio on the median stock in the index currently stood at around 12. That is the same depressed level reached on the entire index during the recession of 1990. With technology stocks included, the index's price-earnings ratio is 43.
"The story here is not just how well tech is doing," Mr. Paulsen said. "The story is equally that most everything else is doing so poorly. I think it would surprise people that outside of technology, the United States' blue chip stock market may break down below the lowest point of the Asian crisis."
This lopsided action in stocks is both unusual and confusing. For example, stocks in many sectors -- banks, consumer durables and basic materials -- are trading at depressed levels that historically have foretold a recession. But the economy is so hot, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, is threatening to raise interest rates again later this month.
Technology stocks, meanwhile, behave as though they are completely immune to the ill effects of rising interest rates, hardly a realistic assessment.
Because the strength in technology shares masks the weakness in everything else, the divided stock market also poses problems for Mr. Greenspan. In recent speeches and testimony, the Fed chairman has singled out the wealth effect created by rising portfolio values as an engine driving the currently hot economy. And he has threatened to raise rates as far as he must to cool the economy and the stock market. But so far, his rate increases have only damaged stocks that were already down, not the highfliers he may have hoped to rein in. And that only pushes more investors into the already hot stocks, driving their prices ever higher.
"Greenspan is mistaken about the wealth effect," said Stefan D. Abrams, chief investment officer for asset allocation at Trust Company of the West. "He's missing the bifurcation. While 50 stocks are racing, the other 450 S.& P. stocks are losers. Every time he plays the Cassandra, he has the effect of accelerating the boom in the hot stocks."
In recent weeks, investors have characterized this tale of two stock markets as a divide between the Old Economy stocks, which are hit hard by rising interest rates, and the new, super-charged technology stocks, which are not. But many economists say this view will be proved wrong.
"The problem I see with the tech sector is it ultimately has cyclicality to it," said William Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs. "People may be a little bit too optimistic thinking that tech is insulated from what happens elsewhere in the economy."
Mr. Paulsen agrees. He says that the Fed will succeed in slowing the economy down and that this will bring the bull market in young technology companies to a screeching halt. "A slower economy would raise the risks inherent in venture capital financing," he said. "It would dry up equity capital flows and kill off these companies' method of financing their operations. I think that is likely over the course of this year."
Today's all-tech all-the-time stock market looks a lot like the 1970's when commodity stocks were the only gainers. What began in the 1960's as an all-inclusive stock market was transformed in the 1970's by inflation. Only those companies, like steel makers and oil producers, that could pass along higher prices to customers, were hot. Everything else faded and ultimately, the entire market did as well.
The current situation, while similar in its narrow focus, is driven by disinflation. While the early years of the current bull market rewarded the majority of companies, now only those companies, like technology concerns that are able to produce goods at ever-cheaper prices, are faring well.
Now, however, Mr. Paulsen is worried that many companies have reached the zenith of productivity and will no longer be able to reduce prices. This would threaten their power status in the market. "What I see now are a lot of companies saying we might be reaching the limit of being able to produce more with less," he said. "Price competition is becoming too extreme in many parts of the economy, and more companies are reporting margin problems."
Procter & Gamble is the most recent victim of this, but the market darlings Dell Computer, Wal-Mart Stores and Compaq Computer have also warned about margin pressures recently.
Some strategists think the extreme stock market disparities of today will soon ease and that beaten-down stocks will recover. "My own personal opinion is the disparity between these two areas has gotten awfully wide," Mr. Dudley said. A result: investors will find some stocks too cheap to pass up. Companies with depressed stock prices may also take themselves private.
What about technology stocks? "Whenever you have momentum investing it's hard to say when it's going to peter out," Mr. Dudley said. "I don't see anything near term that will puncture that bubble." Longer term, however, he doubts that earnings among technology companies can continue to grow at 25 percent or more while the economy is growing at a much slower pace.
Mr. Paulsen thinks that if the economy slows, the broader market will rebound. "Technology would no longer be the big deal," he said. "The inflation scares go away and interest-rate sensitive parts of the stock market will pick up. So will big consumer companies with good unit growth."

HEADLINE: Panel Urges More College Assistance for Poor

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON

 BODY:
New York State should sharply expand its financial aid to college students and continue to concentrate on low-income families rather than the middle class, a panel of prominent educators and former government officials appointed by the State Senate to study financial aid said yesterday.
The commission, headed by Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and Clifton R. Wharton Jr., former chancellor of the State University of New York, said the state should pay 100 percent of the tuition for the neediest students at its two public universities -- SUNY and the City University -- rather than the 90 percent it now pays. 
 Regarding private colleges, the panel called on the state to raise the maximum annual grant in its primary financial aid program -- the Tuition Assistance Program, or TAP -- by more than 20 percent, to $5,000 from $4,125 for undergraduates and to $1,500 from $550 for graduate students.
In many of its recommendations, the panel seemed to be flouting the wishes of the state senators who had commissioned them. Last month, Senator Kenneth LaValle, chairman of the higher education committee, and the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, called for more help for the middle class -- including making college tuition tax deductible and allowing families earning up to $80,000 to qualify for TAP grants.
"I was struck by the unanimity of the commission that the TAP program was worth keeping and strengthening and that the emphasis really ought to be on the underprivileged," Mr. Volcker said yesterday.
The panel leaders expressed hope that their report might have impact because it came as both the Senate and the Assembly were discussing ways to expand financial aid to college students.
"Now that they've come up with their own initiatives, I have more hope that they are going to take some action," Mr. Volcker said.
He and Dr. Wharton met with Senator LaValle, the primary architect behind the commission, and other senators on Tuesday.
In responding to the panel's recommendations, Senate leaders emphasized the overlap with their own proposals. Both the panel's recommendations and those of the senators call for raising the maximum grant for students at private colleges to $5,000 and creating an agency to set higher education policy.
"The bottom line is that we want to make college more affordable for more families," said John McArdle, a spokesman for the Senate.
The 11-member panel, known as the Commission on New York State Student Financial Aid, also said state cutbacks in higher education and TAP grants "threaten New York State's ability to provide sufficient and outstanding higher education opportunities to its citizens."
The panel said that New York's "economy and society have benefited hugely" from TAP. A study for the panel found that more than 78 percent of TAP recipients in 1989 were still living in New York seven years later, investing whatever talents they had in the state.
The commission said that while New York spent $700 million -- more than any other state -- on scholarships, the grants had not kept pace with inflation. Students from families with taxable income of $50,000 or less are eligible for TAP.
Among its other recommendations, the commission called for the state to eliminate the policy that reduces TAP awards to students in their last two years of college and to raise support to private colleges to at least $75 million, an increase of $27 million.

HEADLINE: As Investors Balk, YankeeNets Reduces Loan and Raises Rate

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Resistance from investors forced the company that owns the New York Yankees baseball team and the New Jersey Nets basketball team to cut back on the amount of money it wanted to borrow and to increase the interest rate it will pay.
The company, YankeeNets L.L.C., said yesterday that it would issue $200 million in seven-year bonds paying interest of 12.75 percent. It originally wanted to borrow $250 million at 11.75 percent, though the rate discussed with investors had risen to 12.25 percent by last week. 
 "Based on the interest rate and the need of YankeeNets, we have limited the offering to $200 million at an interest rate of 12.75 percent," Howard Rubenstein, a spokesman for YankeeNets and a director, said yesterday. He said the company was "pleased with the outcome."
Mr. Rubenstein had no comment on how the cut in the amount being borrowed would affect the uses of the proceeds from the borrowing. The preliminary offering document had said that only $15 million would go to operations of the two teams, with $80 million set aside to pay interest for the first three years and most of the rest being distributed to the owners of YankeeNets.
George Steinbrenner, the managing general partner of the Yankees, had been scheduled to get about $40 million from the proceeds of the offering and a related sale of a stake in the company to unidentified investors. The cut in the size of the bond offering appears likely to reduce his take by about $8 million or more. Former owners of the Nets, who had to borrow large amounts of money to complete the merger of the two teams and who planned to use the distribution to repay those loans, will also receive less than expected.
First Union Securities was the lead underwriter for the offering, with Merrill Lynch as co-manager.

Shares Rebound as Oil Prices and Fears on Inflation Ease

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
Stocks staged a modest rebound yesterday, overcoming early jitters to close broadly higher as oil prices eased and a Federal Reserve survey found inflation still limited despite intensified pressure on wages.
Bargain seekers scooped up shares of drug and other depressed issues, including such industrial stalwarts as Alcoa and International Paper, after two days of battering that had knocked 571 points off the Dow Jones industrial average. 
 The Dow closed 60.50 points, or 0.62 percent, higher at 9,856.53, but was still nearly 16 percent below the record it set in mid-January.
Technology stocks also turned in a solid performance, with the Nasdaq composite index gaining 49.42, or 1.02 percent, to 4,897.26, just short of its peak last Friday.
"People are getting a little more rational and rotating into companies that have been annihilated" in the correction of so-called old economy stocks, said Donna Van Vlack, chief trader at Brandywine Asset Management. "A lot of babies have been thrown out with a lot of bath water."
Drug stocks, suffering from regulatory fears and in some cases from patent expirations, surged with the aid of recommendations from at least three Wall Street houses. Bristol-Myers Squibb gained 4 3/4, to 47 3/4; Schering-Plough rose 3 1/4, to 33 13/16 ; and Pfizer added 2 1/16 , to 32 7/16 . Others followed, including Warner-Lambert, up 5 13/16 , to 85 13/16 ; American Home Products, up 3 7/8, to 45 3/8; and Merck, up 3 1/16 , to 56 13/16 .
Airlines benefited from a sharp decline in the price of oil after Saudi Arabia and Iran sent a strong signal of significant production increases. Continental; Delta Air Lines; AMR, parent of American; and US Airways all gained three points or more.
Except for ARCO, which gained 5 3/8, to 81, on seemingly improved prospects for its acquisition by BP Amoco, most major oil companies gave up fractions of a point after big run-ups, but those engaged mainly in exploration fell sharply. Schlumberger and B.J. Services lost more than 5 points each, while Halliburton lost more than 4.
Investors continued to favor initial public offerings. Yesterday's star was Crayfish, a Japanese company that provides e-mail host services for businesses. Its 4.35 million American depository receipts, priced at 24 1/2, began trading at 96 and soared as high as 166 before closing at 126 on volume of 7.7 million shares.
Despite a rebound in industrial shares, like Alcoa's 2 7/16 gain, to 67 3/8, and International Paper's 2 41//64 gain, to 36 1/64 , "we continue to think the tech stocks will lead" the market, said Todd Salamone, research director at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati.
He predicted that Procter & Gamble, which plunged nearly 31 percent on Tuesday after warning of lower profits, would skid further, along with other consumer stocks that remain fairly expensive by traditional standards. P.& G. fell 2 11/16 yesterday, to 57 11/16 , less than half the 118 3/8 at which it traded at its peak on Jan. 12. More than 37 million shares changed hands compared with 68 million on Tuesday.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 11.08, or 0.82 percent, to 1,366.70, with 268 issues up, 218 down and 14 unchanged. Oracle was one of the biggest contributors, jumping 8 3/16 , to 83 1/8, but other technology stocks were also strong. JDS Uniphase, however, fell 11 3/4, to 275 5/8, after a disclosure that Goldman, Sachs sold 816,819 shares last month.
On the New York Stock Exchange, declining issues outnumbered advancing ones, 1,537 to 1,445, on heavy volume of 1.2 billion shares, just below Tuesday's, the second-busiest on record. New 52-week lows swamped new highs, 253 to 50.

 	 	 		--------------------	 	Treasuries Are Off
By Bloomberg News
Treasury bond prices fell yesterday on expectations that the Federal Reserve would keep raising interest rates until the economy slowed and as high oil prices increased concern about inflation.
"Yields are fair or, in our view, a little too low" to warrant buying, said Mike Martino, who helps manage $70 billion at Putnam Investments in Boston.
The Fed will vote for at least two quarter-point increases in coming months, and as many as four this year, he said. Mr. Martino is sticking to a strategy of gradually selling five-year Treasuries and using cash to buy nongovernment debt for its higher yield.
The price of the 30-year bond fell 6/32 , to 101 9/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.16 percent from 6.14 on Tuesday.

Indian officials reacted today with understated disgruntlement to President Clinton's decision to call briefly on their adversary, Pakistan, after a five-day tour of India this month. Pakistani officials were happy and relieved.
In a telephone conversation, India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, warned Mr. Clinton on Tuesday night that Pakistan's military rulers would use his decision to claim legitimacy for their coup on Oct. 12 -- and that is what happened today. Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the army chief who has ruled Pakistan since the coup, told a Reuters reporter in Islamabad that Mr. Clinton's decision "vindicates the legitimacy of my government's stand and gives credence to our aim to put things right in our country." 
 President Clinton's decision came after weeks of infighting in his administration. White House officials said the purpose of the trip was not to sanction the coup, but to deliver a message to the military rulers that they should restore democracy, ratchet down the tensions with India and ban an Islamic fundamentalist group that the United States has accused of terrorism.
While Prime Minister Vajpayee was not surprised by the decision, which had been expected, and though he is aware that India will still be the main event on Mr. Clinton's South Asia trip, he was nonetheless displeased.
The Indians have campaigned to isolate Pakistan since an Indian Airlines commercial flight was hijacked Dec. 24 with what India maintained was Pakistani military sponsorship. Indian diplomats have been pressing the United States to declare Pakistan a sponsor of terrorism and lobbying Mr. Clinton to bypass Pakistan on his trip.
When the president finally made his decision on Tuesday, he called Mr. Vajpayee to break the news before announcing it publicly. H. K. Dua, spokesman for the prime minister, said Mr. Vajpayee told the president that his visit to Pakistan "would give the military regime a signal of support." Still, Mr. Vajpayee assured Mr. Clinton that he would be warmly welcomed here.
Officials in Pakistan, which is smaller and economically weaker than India, sought to put a bright face on the president's decision to stop for a few hours in Islamabad. They said they believed that Mr. Clinton would use his influence to help them resolve their half-century-old dispute with India over the territory of Kashmir.
"I have a good feeling that President Clinton will urge India to also take the path of negotiations and a peaceful resolution to the Kashmir dispute," Tariq Altaf, a spokesman for the Pakistani Foreign Office, said today.
Though Mr. Clinton has repeatedly stated that the United States will not mediate the Kashmir conflict until India welcomes its intervention -- something India has adamantly refused to do -- he has also repeatedly said that South Asia is one of the most dangerous places on earth because of India and Pakistan's festering, violent clash over Kashmir.
Javed Jabbar, an adviser to General Musharraf, told reporters in Multan, a city in the Punjab, that the talks between Mr. Clinton and Pakistani officials would focus on Kashmir and other basic issues. He called the president's decision to visit "important for peace and progress in South Asia and it justifies our stand."
He also said it was a blow to India's prime minister, who "has been continuously trying to malign Pakistan and encourage the U.S. to declare it a terrorist state."

HEADLINE: Clinton's Words on China: Trade Is the Smart Thing

BYLINE: By The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Clinton's speech today at the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies of the Johns Hopkins University, as recorded by the Federal News Service, a transcription company:
Most of the critics of the China W.T.O. agreement do not seriously question its economic benefits. They're more likely to say things like this: China is a growing threat to Taiwan and its neighbors -- we shouldn't strengthen it. Or China violates labor rights and human rights -- we shouldn't reward it. Or China is a dangerous proliferator -- we shouldn't empower it. These concerns are valid. But the conclusion of those who raise them as an argument against China-W.T.O. isn't. . . . The question is not whether we approve or disapprove of China's practices. The question is what's the smartest thing to do. to improve these practices. . . . 
 The change this agreement can bring from outside is quite extraordinary. But I think you could make an argument that it will be nothing compared to the changes that this agreement will spark from the inside out in China. By joining the W.T.O., China is not simply agreeing to import more of our products. It is agreeing to import one of democracy's most cherished values, economic freedom. The more China liberalizes its economy, the more fully it will liberate the potential of its people -- their initiative, their imagination, their remarkable spirit of enterprise. And when individuals have the power, not just to dream, but to realize their dreams, they will demand a greater say.
Already, more and more of China's best and brightest are starting their own companies or seeking jobs with foreign-owned companies, where generally they get higher pay, more respect and a better working environment. In fits and starts, for the first time, China may become a society where people get ahead based on what they know rather than who they know.
Chinese firms more and more are realizing that unless they treat employees with respect, they will lose out in the competition for top talent. The process will only accelerate as China joins the W.T.O., and we should encourage it, because it will lift standards for Chinese workers and their expectations.
There's something even more revolutionary at work here. By lowering the barriers that protect state-owned industries, China is speeding a process that is removing government from vast areas of people's lives. In the past, virtually every Chinese citizen woke up in an apartment or a house owned by the government, went to work in a factory or a farm run by the government and read newspapers published by the government. State-run workplaces also operated the schools where they sent their children, the clinics where they received health care, the stores where they bought food. That system was a big source of the Communist Party's power. Now people are leaving those firms, and when China joins the W.T.O., they will leave them faster. The Chinese government no longer will be everyone's employer, landlord, shopkeeper and nanny all rolled into one. It will have fewer instruments, therefore, with which to control people's lives. And that may lead to very profound change. The genie of freedom will not go back into the bottle. As Justice Earl Warren once said, liberty is the most contagious force in the world. In the new century, liberty will spread by cell phone and cable modem. In the past year, the number of Internet addresses in China has more than quadrupled, from two million to nine million. This year, the number is expected to grow to over 20 million.
When China joins the W.T.O., by 2005 it will eliminate tariffs on information technology products, making the tools of communication even cheaper, better and more widely available. We know how much the Internet has changed America, and we are already an open society. Imagine how much it could change China. Now there's no question China has been trying to crack down on the Internet. Good luck! That's sort of like trying to nail Jell-O to the wall. But I would argue to you that their effort to do that just proves how real these changes are and how much they threaten the status quo. It's not an argument for slowing down the effort to bring China into the world. It's an argument for accelerating that effort. . . .
Bringing China into the W.T.O. doesn't guarantee that it will choose political reform. But . . . the process of economic change will . . . make the imperative for the right choice stronger. And again I ask if China is willing to take this risk -- and these leaders are very intelligent people; they know exactly what they're doing -- . . . how can we turn our backs on the chance to take them up on it?

U.S., Strapped for Labor, Lets Illegal Workers Stay
In a booming economy running short of labor, hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants are increasingly tolerated in the nation's workplaces. The Immigration and Naturalization Service has made crossing the border harder than ever, but once inside the country, illegal immigrants are now largely left alone.
The new lenience helps explain why overall wage increases have been less than many economists and policy makers had expected, given an unemployment rate of only 4 percent and a strong demand for people to fill jobs that pay $8 an hour or less. Page A1.
 
China Trade Bill Sent to Congress
President Clinton sent Congress his bill to usher China into the World Trade Organization. He then opened a new front in the debate, arguing that opening up China's markets will undermine Communist Party control. A1. 

Money Manager Buys 6% of Aetna
Betting that the stock market has drastically misjudged Aetna, Southeastern Asset Management, a money management company in Memphis, announced in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had acquired 6 percent of Aetna for $444 million. Shares of Aetna rose $2.9375, to $54.125. The stock, which slid to a 12-month low of $38.50 three weeks ago, rose sharply after Aetna, the nation's biggest health insurer, confirmed last week that it was considering a buyout feeler from Wellpoint Health Plans of California and the ING Group, a Dutch financial services and insurance company. C2.
 
Stocks Recover as Oil Prices Dip
Stocks staged a modest rebound as oil prices eased and a Federal Reserve survey found inflation limited. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 60.50 points, or 0.62 percent, to 9,856.53. The Nasdaq composite index gained 49.42 points, or 1.02 percent, to 4,897.26. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index advanced 11.08 points, or 0.82 percent, to 1,366.70. C14.
 
YankeeNets Reduces Bond Offering
Resistance from investors forced YankeeNets, which owns the New York Yankees baseball team and the New Jersey Nets basketball team, to cut back on the amount of money it wanted to borrow and to increase the interest rate it will pay. The cut in the size of the bond offering appears likely to reduce George Steinbrenner's take. C26.
 
Qwest Seeks to Resurrect Talks
After negotiations by Qwest Communications International for acquisition by Deutsche Telekom essentially collapsed, Qwest's chairman, Joseph P. Nacchio, spent much of the day putting together a proposal meant to bring the German company back to the bargaining table, executives close to the talks said. C9.
 
Investing in the 'Post-PC World'
A group of former executives from Microsoft are expected to announce the creation of a holding company to invest in and nurture start-ups focused on what has been called the "post-PC world," a time when the personal computer and Microsoft no longer dominate the technology markets. The chairman and chief executive of the new venture, Ignition, is Brad Silverberg, 45, who guided Microsoft's catch-up strategy to embrace the Internet. C6.
 
Tax Expert Urges Tougher Penalties
The tough penalties Congress enacted to discourage abusive corporate tax shelters are so riddled with loopholes that they fail to deter tax cheating by large companies, Congress's top tax expert told a Senate committee. She called for tightening the penalties. C6.

HEADLINE: President Says Measure Raises the Minimum Wage Too Slowly

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
With a checkout clerk at his side, President Clinton said today that a minimum wage increase set for a House vote on Thursday would cut business taxes too much and raise the pay of low-wage workers too little.
Calling on the Congress to "stop nickel and diming the American people," the president urged lawmakers to increase the minimum wage of $5.15 an hour to $6.15 over two years instead of three, and to drop the proposed tax reductions of $122 billion over 10 years. 
 To put the heat on the Republicans and highlight what is sure to become an election issue this fall, Mr. Clinton held a rally on the South Lawn of the White House with Democratic leaders of Congress and Cheryl Costas, a clerk from Pennsylvania who is the sole wage earner for her disabled husband and four children.
"What else can you ask this woman to do?" the president said of Mrs. Costas, who studies full time at a local university and works at Colton Alba Grocery and Gas in Colton Alba, Pa. "She's kept her family together. Her husband has a disability. She's supporting her four kids. She's going to school full time. Now, how can Congress justify saying no to her?"
House Republicans, many of whom oppose any minimum wage increase, are scheduled to take up a bill on Thursday that would raise the minimum hourly wage to $5.48 this year, $5.81 next April and $6.15 in April 2002. Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, has called the legislation sponsored by Representatives John Shimkus of Illinois and Rick A. Lazio of Suffolk, both Republicans, "the least worst way to do the wrong thing."
Most Democrats want to speed the increase over two years -- 50 cents this year and 50 cents in 2001 -- and drastically scale back the tax reductions. The Republican plan would make sharp cuts in the estate tax, accelerate a plan to make health insurance tax deductible for the self-employed and reduce other taxes for small businesses.
The House measure is similar to a Senate bill passed in February. A $1 increase in the minimum wage over three years was included in bankruptcy reform legislation that passed, 83 to 14, along with $76 billion in tax breaks over 10 years.
In a letter to Republican Congressional leaders on Tuesday, Mr. Clinton threatened to block any bill that provides for large tax cuts or that spreads the raise over three years.
Republicans say they have written a compromise bill that helps minimum wage earners but also provides benefits to the businesses that must bear the increased payroll costs.
Today, Mr. Clinton released a study by the National Economic Council saying that 10 million workers earn less than $6.15 an hour and therefore would benefit from the $1 increase. About 69 percent of them are over 20 years of age, about 45 percent work full time and about 60 percent are women, the study said.
Republican opponents say an increased minimum wage would mainly go to young people, and point to studies saying that two-thirds of the minimum-wage workers are part-time employees, more than half are under 25 and only 8 percent are women who are heads of households.
Mrs. Costas, whose pay was raised recently to $5.50 an hour from $5.15, said her boss was not thrilled by her decision to go to Washington to make the case for more pay. The owner of the store told her, she said, that he would probably have to raise prices if the minimum wage increase passed. She said she told him that the economy was such that he could probably afford the higher costs.

HEADLINE: Clinton Sends to a Wary Congress A Long-Delayed China Trade Bill

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
President Clinton today sent Congress his bill to usher China into the World Trade Organization. He then opened a new front in the debate on the subject in his own party, arguing that opening China's markets will undermine Communist Party control.
In a speech at the Johns Hopkins University's foreign affairs graduate school here, Mr. Clinton tried to float above the bitter economic debate in his party about the wisdom of the legislation, and he said little about Taiwan, whose tense relations with China have been worsening. 
 But he made an argument that opening up China's economy amounted to a poison pill for China's Communist leaders.
"In the new century, liberty will spread by cell phone and cable modem," Mr. Clinton told a crowd that included students, lobbyists and many cabinet members, who are now making daily calls to Congress about the issue.
When it joins the Geneva-based trade organization, the president said, China will be obliged to make "the tools of communication even cheaper, better and more widely available."
"We know how much the Internet has changed America, and we are already an open society," he said. "Imagine how much it could change China." Excerpts, Page A10.
Mr. Clinton acknowledged that since the deal was signed four months ago, China's leaders have tried to control the kind of sites Chinese can reach via the Internet and to prevent foreign ownership of Internet-related companies. But to the Chinese leaders trying to control the Internet in a country as vast and hard to police as China, he said he had only two words: "Good luck!"
The long-delayed transmission of the bill to Congress -- it appeared timed to arrive after Vice President Gore had the Democratic presidential nomination firmly in grasp -- set off a battle within the Democratic Party that intertwines the politics of trade, the presidential election and Mr. Clinton's final effort to recast relations with Beijing.
The legislation's prospects are unclear. Only 50 to 60 Democratic members of the House appear ready to support the bill, which would grant permanent "normal" trade status to China. That is the one legal prerequisite that would let American companies benefit from market openings China promised in 13 years of negotiations that ended in November.
That means that Mr. Clinton is dependent on support from House and Senate Republicans to pass what may be the last major foreign policy legislation of his presidency. Senate passage is thought likely. But the vote in the House is expected to be very close. By most estimates, President Clinton would have to win over at least 20 more Democrats in the House to secure passage.
He is getting little help from Vice President Gore, who, to appease labor unions that vociferously oppose the deal, said three weeks ago that he would negotiate something better if elected to office. Mr. Gore later reiterated his support for the deal the administration struck, but his aides did not return calls on the subject today.
Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the presumed Republican nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, said Mr. Bush remains a "vocal supporter" of China's entry into the trade organization, because "it is in our interest, and it is in the interest of the Chinese to grow an entrepreneurial middle class."
But he said the governor did not yet have a position on tying passage of the bill to providing new arms for Taiwan, a movement that several Republicans are considering as the price for their support.
Mr. Clinton was introduced today by Paul Wolfowitz, dean of the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies. But Mr. Wolfowitz, who is one of Governor Bush's leading foreign policy advisers, did not mention that Mr. Bush has been more vocal in his support of the bill than Mr. Clinton's own vice president.
Mr. Clinton's argument today that entry to the regulatory body would loosen the hold of China's Communist leaders is bound to set off considerable debate, because it is far from clear that China's economic openings have been matched by a political relaxation.
Mr. Clinton made essentially the same argument in 1994 when he reversed himself, and said that despite his campaign promises he would no longer link the annual renewal of Chinese trade benefits to its human rights record. Over time, he said, trade would contribute to a lifting of political repression.
But in the six years since then, according to the annual reports published by the State Department, China's rights record has worsened.
"It's a risky argument because it leaves him vulnerable to the charge that he's overplaying what this agreement will do in China," said Nicholas Lardy, a China expert at the Brookings Institution. "It was a good speech, but there may have been too much emphasis on what this will do to change China rather than why it's in the national interests of the United States."
Even as Mr. Clinton spoke, his advisers foresaw a fierce battle in Congress, where they are trying to win passage by mid-May, before the congressional elections heat up.
And today Mr. Clinton lost a major ally: Representative John P. Murtha, a Pennsylvania Democrat who is influential with his colleagues on military issues.
In a letter to his colleagues, Mr. Murtha, who has consistently voted to renew China's trading rights with the United States, said he now believes it would be a mistake to lose the leverage of an annual vote.
He said his mind was made up when China threatened "drastic measures" and "the use of force" against Taiwan if it was found to be indefinitely delaying unification talks.
"It is not in our national security interest," he concluded, "to condone and reward grossly irresponsible conduct."
While Mr. Clinton has been meeting with members of Congress for several weeks to press his case, Democratic and Republican leaders on Capitol Hill have complained that the White House was running out of time -- and needed to send up a bill. Senator Daniel P. Moynihan, Democrat of New York and a supporter of permanent normal trade relations, a status that most nations enjoy, complained two weeks ago that the White House needed to act soon.
Clearly part of that hesitation was the pressure on Vice President Gore. But now some White House officials say they hope he will strengthen his support, even if it means angering unions. "Where is the A.F.L.-C.I.O. going to run?" one cabinet member said today. "To George Bush?"
But the big issue is the Democratic members of Congress, who are caught between labor, which vows to defeat anyone supporting the bill, and business interests, which are organizing an advertising campaign for it. That effort is led by agricultural and technology concerns.
Meanwhile, China is nervous that the bill will fail, and Chinese officials have begun an unusual lobbying campaign. One senior administration official said this week that he feared that "China's own efforts could backfire on us big time."
But Mr. Clinton noted today that even if Congress votes against normal trade relations, China will still get into the world body.
A vote against the bill, Mr. Clinton said, "will cost America jobs as our competitors in Europe, Asia and elsewhere capture Chinese markets that we otherwise would have served."

HEADLINE: I.N.S. Is Looking the Other Way As Illegal Immigrants Fill Jobs

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

DATELINE: CHICAGO

 BODY:
Salvador Silva often used to worry that immigration agents would raid the commercial laundry where he works. If they did, he had a plan. He would jump onto a table, hoist himself into an air-conditioning duct, and hide there until the agents left. He practiced this more than once.
"We lived with the uncertainty of raids," said Mr. Silva, who is 26 and has worked illegally in this country for 10 years, ever since he walked across a bridge from Juarez in Mexico to El Paso and flew to Chicago to join a brother. Only now is he beginning to relax. "For the first time," he said, "I don't fear the raids." 
 Such raids have all but stopped around the country over the last year. In a booming economy running short of labor, hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants are increasingly tolerated in the nation's workplaces. The Immigration and Naturalization Service has made crossing the border harder than ever, stepping up patrols and prosecuting companies that smuggle in aliens or blatantly recruit them. But once inside the country, illegal immigrants are now largely left alone. Even when these people are discovered, arrests for the purpose of deportation are much less frequent; such arrests dropped to about 8,600 last year from 22,000 just two years earlier, the I.N.S. reports.
The agency now concentrates on picking up aliens who have committed a crime. The rest are in effect allowed to help American employers fill jobs. "It is just the market at work, drawing people to jobs, and the I.N.S. has chosen to concentrate its actions on aliens who are a danger to the community," said Robert L. Bach, the agency's associate commissioner for policy and planning.
The new lenience helps explain why overall wage increases have been less than many economists and policy makers had expected, given an unemployment rate of only 4 percent and a strong demand for people to fill jobs that pay $8 an hour or less, which is 25 percent of all jobs. Immigrants -- legal and illegal -- have fed the pool of people available to take these lower-paying jobs. But Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, told Congress last month that as job growth expands, the pool keeps shrinking. That is one reason the Fed is raising interest rates to slow the economy before wage pressures become inflationary.
Mr. Greenspan and many other economists, though, are looking only at people living in this country, including an estimated six million illegal immigrants, as potential candidates to feed that pool. But the more tolerant I.N.S. policy may be inducing more workers to immigrate, particularly from Mexico, because -- once they manage to get here -- they face less risk in taking a job. That would dilute the labor shortage -- and the wage pressure that worries Mr. Greenspan. In fact, it may already be doing so.
"None of us really knows how big the pool of available workers is," said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute, "but the more lenient stance can only increase the number of people available abroad for jobs in the United States."
The commercial laundry industry in Chicago, where Mr. Silva works, clearly benefits from the Immigration Service's live-and-let-work approach. Thirty companies wash and iron the city's hospital and restaurant linens, hotel sheets and towels, and factory uniforms. Half of their 2,800 employees are illegal immigrants, mainly Hispanics, according to Unite, the union that has organized most of them in recent months.
Last fall, Unite negotiated contracts that recognized the illegal status of some workers, and shielded them. One clause requires an employer to bar an I.N.S. raid unless the agents have a search warrant. And a company must notify the union if it gets wind of a coming raid.
"Sometimes I did not want to go to work," Mr. Silva said. "I saw reports on TV of immigration raids and people being led away and I worried that would happen to me. Now the union contract is reassuring, and I no longer see raids on television."
A third clause states that when former employees are rehired with new papers -- even new names -- after their original documents are found to be false, they retain their seniority and resume their old pay level. Union scale goes as high as $8.75 an hour.
"The Immigration Service has never had the resources to arrest every illegal alien, and now there is a large number and a demand from many companies to employ them," said Brian R. Perryman, the agency's director in Chicago. "Once they come into the Chicago metropolitan area, with its 6.5 million people, it is hard to stop the process."
A downturn in the booming economy and any resulting uptick in unemployment could lead the I.N.S. to revive its pursuit of illegal immigrants at work. Even now, some Republican members of Congress are pushing for legislation that would step up efforts to prevent illegal immigrants from working in the United States. Certainly, the more open policy today stands in sharp contrast to the 1980's and even the mid-1990's, when unemployment was higher.
The new attitude here is the opposite of the approach in most European countries, where unemployment rates are higher than in the United States and governments have tightened immigration laws.
But right now the route to work in the United States is fairly smooth. One reason is that employment laws are easy for illegal immigrants to evade. Workers are required to offer proof of eligibility -- a Social Security card and a picture ID. But counterfeits are easily purchased for $60 to $80 in this city's immigrant neighborhoods, a favorite being a rose-colored resident-alien card, which two immigrants showed to this reporter.
The laminated cards displayed photographs that were accurate but fingerprints the workers said were not theirs. "The birth date isn't mine either, or the signature, although the name is right," said Angel Hernandez Lopez, a 25-year-old Mexican. "For $80, they do everything," he said of the counterfeiters.
Employers can be fined for knowingly hiring illegal workers, but they also risk being sued for discrimination if they challenge documents that on the surface seem authentic. What's more, the Social Security Administration checks only once a year for numbers that fail to match legitimate pension accounts, and when it finds a discrepancy, it never assumes it is immigrant fraud as opposed to a mismatch resulting from a divorce, a job switch or a name changed through marriage.
"We know that illegal immigrants are a factor," said Norman Goldstein, a senior financial executive at Social Security, "but I cannot quantify for you how that factor compares with other factors."
When a letter calling attention to a discrepancy does finally go out, it goes to the employer or the employee, or both, but not the Immigration Service, which cannot by law be privy to tax matters. Even when the I.N.S. does get involved, the employee is now usually given time to correct the problem. For illegal workers that means time to change names, get new papers or change jobs.
An illegal immigrant is at little risk these days, Mr. Bach said, "unless the employer turns a worker in, and employers usually do that only to break a union or prevent a strike or that kind of stuff."
Curtailing undocumented workers, then, rests as much with employers as with the I.N.S., and in an economy short of workers, employers are not rushing into action. On the contrary, they want the I.N.S. to go easier as well on highly skilled, college-educated immigrants -- the engineers, chemists, computer experts and college professors who now enter the country on special H-1B visas. A coalition of business groups is lobbying Congress to raise the ceiling on these visas to 195,000 a year from 115,000.
"In a perfect world, immigration at all levels would be entirely market-driven, with appropriate protections of course for native workers," said Sandra J. Boyd, of the National Association of Manufacturers, who leads the coalition.
Short of this goal, the temporary- help agencies that have sprung up in storefronts in Chicago's Hispanic neighborhoods are benefiting from the new leniency. The $5.15-an-hour minimum-wage jobs these agencies offer are usually the first that arriving immigrants manage to land. They have settled by the thousands in old blue-collar neighborhoods like Pilsen, southwest of the Loop. Their growing presence in this city has given Illinois the nation's fifth-largest immigrant population, behind California, New York, Florida and Texas.
Six temp agencies near West 18th Street and Blue Island Avenue, in the heart of Pilsen, become predawn gathering places for immigrants seeking work. More than 30 waited expectantly one day in late February at Ron's Temporary Help Services, some perched in what was once the window display of this former store. An old iron radiator heated the room.
The immigrants, mostly from Mexico, hoped that Gloria de la Torre, the 36-year-old manager -- herself an illegal immigrant until three years ago, she says -- will favor them with one of the jobs that go out by the thousands each day from 100 agencies like Ron's in Hispanic neighborhoods. That is up from 50 in 1985, according to Nik Theodore, research director at the Center for Urban Economic Development at the University of Illinois in Chicago.
During the peak demand for these workers, from April through September, more than 30,000 a day are placed by the temp agencies, Mr. Theodore says, basing his estimate on his field research. The Ron's office that Ms. de la Torre manages sends out 1,000 workers over three shifts in those months, she says. But in late February, the flow is down to 100 a day, and two vans are double- parked outside waiting to take some immigrants to jobs in the suburbs.
The temp agencies deal in a variety of work -- assembling coolers, eyeglass cases and other products; making sandwiches for airline meals; stuffing envelopes; construction; packaging perfumes; painting machinery; staffing warehouses that ship merchandise ordered over the Internet.
Motorola is a regular customer, using workers from the temp agencies to pack computer monitors in shipping cartons, among other tasks. The agencies, not Motorola, have the responsibility for making certain that the people sent to Motorola are legally authorized to work, a Motorola press officer said.
The people Ms. de la Torre sends out all present her with the necessary documents, which she accepts at face value. Paychecks come with stubs that detail deductions for taxes, Social Security and, for those who travel in vans to their jobs, $3.50 a day for transportation.
"I have never been visited by Immigration," Ms. de la Torre said.
But the precarious status of an illegal immigrant makes them easy victims for exploitation, the A.F.L.-C.I.O. says. They are filling the low-wage jobs readily enough, but they lack the bargaining power to get higher on the pay scale, or upgrade their working conditions, the labor organization says. That is a big reason they are in demand, it adds.
Unite's contracts covering laundry workers are an attempt to counter this situation. The A.F.L.-C.I.O. also called for the legalization of those already in the country so they can be more easily represented.
Mr. Bach, the immigration official, said, "Workers are supposed to make gains in tight labor markets, but what you are seeing is employers using illegal immigrants to undercut the expectations of labor."

HEADLINE: GORE AND BUSH SET FOR A FIERY RACE THAT STARTS NOW

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE

 BODY:
Strategists for Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush said yesterday that there would be no letup from the primary season as they move quickly to define each other on the stump and on the air in an unusually frenetic five-month run up to their parties' nominating conventions.
Both campaigns recalled how Bob Dole in 1996 and Michael S. Dukakis in 1988 lay dormant in the summer before the general election, allowing their rivals to gain the upper hand through television or oratorical barrages. This time, officials on both sides said, that will not happen. 
 The sheer competitiveness of the race -- early polls show Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush running neck and neck -- also seems to be driving each candidate to be engaged earlier and more forcefully than in past campaigns. Even if the candidates wanted to lie low, strategists on both sides said, they could not because of the proliferation of coverage on the Internet and on cable television.
"There will be a continued focus on message each and every day," said Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief strategist. "Virtually every day, Bush will be somewhere in a position to comment on something of significance."
Christopher Lehane, a spokesman for Mr. Gore, put it this way: "Strap on your seat belt. The roller coaster ride has just begun. If people think the pace has been intense up to this point, they haven't seen anything yet."
The Bush and Gore strategists said they could enjoy the luxury of looking ahead because of their candidates' coast-to-coast triumphs in a string of contests on Tuesday, the biggest primary day of the year. Bill Bradley, after failing to win a single contest, plans to quit the Democratic race today while Senator John McCain, trailing badly in the Republican contest, may follow suit.
But Mr. Gore showed no sign of slowing down yesterday as he traveled to Michigan and Minnesota, where Democratic delegates are being selected in coming days. Mr. Bush basked in his victory by staying home in Austin, Tex., as he prepared for stops today in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming, where there will be contests on Friday.
Each side is aggressively seeking the loyalties of the independents and Democrats who flocked to Mr. McCain, and they are also battling over a small group of swing voters, mostly in the Midwest, who are usually pivotal to the outcome. Strategists in both camps said they were scheduling trips to the battleground states of Florida. Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey, Ohio and Pennsylvania.
The candidates are also taking special steps to address their own vulnerabilities. Mr. Bush, for example, is planning international trips -- one possibility is traveling to European capitals -- to demonstrate his grasp of international affairs and military matters.
Mr. Rove also said that as is customary for the nominee, the Bush campaign is considering making changes at the Republican National Committee. Asked if Mr. Bush would seek to replace the chairman, Jim Nicholson, he said, "I doubt that." But he said he would probably want to move Bush loyalists into the committee.
And Mr. Gore is trying to win over Mr. McCain's supporters with an extensive series of town meetings with independent and undecided voters.
"This is a year when not advertising but contact with the people has actually mattered a lot," said Robert Shrum, one of Mr. Gore's chief strategists. "You will see Al Gore doing a lot of it."
Even so, advertising is at the heart of both campaigns' blueprints in the coming months. Mr. Bush is counting on a financial advantage because he did not accept federal subsidies in the primaries and therefore, unlike Mr. Gore, is not subject to spending caps. But both the Republican and Democratic Parties are collecting so-called unregulated soft money which officials in the two campaigns said each party would channel into issue advertising intended to help its candidate or hurt his rival.
Campaign officials do not like talking publicly about the plans for television blitzes. Asked what his campaign had in store, Mr. Rove said: "We have flexibility. We have footage collected. And we have thoughts developed."
Mr. Shrum, even less direct, said, "I don't want to talk about that." Pressed further, he added, "The Gore campaign will be ready to do what it has to do."
The airwaves in coming months may be cluttered not only by party-sponsored commercials but also by advertisements produced by outside issue groups that favor one candidate or another.
There may be, of course, some bluffing in the Bush and Gore organizations. It is hard to picture the candidates maintaining nonstop schedules until the conventions in late summer. Even so, the candidates are clearly determined not to repeat the mistakes of losers in the past.
A telling sign of how quickly the campaigns have shifted to general election strategies -- even before either candidate has officially accumulated enough delegates to win the nomination -- was in the victory speeches by Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore on Tuesday night. It is customary in such addresses for candidates to refer only briefly to the race ahead. But Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore spelled out what their advisers said yesterday would be basic themes for the entire general election campaign.
Both candidates are racing to the center by highlighting their more moderate stands. Mr. Bush is seeking to paint Mr. Gore as a creature of Washington who, despite his deep involvement as vice president, could not make sufficient progress on issues ranging from education to health case. They will also remind voters of his ties to President Clinton and of his own role in the 1996 campaign finance excesses.
In a theme that Bush officials said they hoped would reverberate month after month, Mr. Bush declared on Tuesday: "America must not give Clinton-Gore four more years."
Beyond attacking Mr. Gore, the Bush campaign is seeking to generate appeal, especially among women, by stressing the "compassionate conservative" message upon which he based the early days of his candidacy. In particular, Mr. Bush's aides said they expected him to speak frequently about education.
Mr. Gore, by contrast, will emphasize his own credentials on the education issue and seek credit for his role in presiding over the hardiest economy in decades. On a host of issues, Mr. Gore will portray Mr. Bush as intolerant and as a vessel for the religious right and extremists. His aides said he would accuse Mr. Bush of being against gun control, a woman's right to have an abortion, a patient's bill of rights and against environment regulations. And, as Mr. Gore asserted on Tuesday, he would ridicule the governor's economic proposals as part of a "risky tax scheme."
Several strategists in both parties said the candidates acted so aggressively to put forth their themes because their greatest fear is that they will be defined by their opponents and forfeit the opportunity to alter their images.
"The first guy to let down his guard loses in these races," said Alex Castellanos, a Republican media consultant. "So I don't see any fallow period any more in elections. The lesson Bill Clinton taught everyone is you don't lay low. And Republicans have learned that too."
For all their planned hectic campaign schedules, aides to Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore offered some caveats. Their candidates, they said, could conceivably take some time off. But they were careful to avoid the word "vacation," and to note that any respite would be only brief.
More than one aide recalled how after Mr. Dukakis captured the Democratic nomination in 1988, he returned to his home state of Massachusetts -- where he was still governor -- and virtually vanished from the national scene. For weeks, he tended mostly to state business and rarely ventured beyond the western border of the state.
Some strategists said they were not eager for the intense period of stumping, but saw no other option.
"I don't believe the voters want to be inundated with political campaigning every day for the next 35 weeks," said Haley Barbour, an adviser to Mr. Bush and former chairman of the Republican Party. "However, with 24-hour news television and the Internet and the vastly increased news outlets, I feel the press won't let it rest. Every news organization is going to demand a Bush story and a Gore story every day."
But Joe Andrew, the national chairman of the Democratic Party, seemed eager for the action. Already, he said, the party had begun making decisions on advertising "based literally on hourly reads on where the candidates are and where they're going -- we're looking forward to continual engagement. It will be fluid and dynamic."
The danger, of course, is the voters will tire of the candidates. But that does not seem to weigh heavily on the campaigns.
"The fear is, if you're not keeping your periscope up, that you might be forgotten," said Ronald Kaufman, a Republican national committeeman from Massachusetts. "Overexposure is the last thing to worry about. Not the first."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE QUEST;
His Early Promise Vanished, Bradley Plans to Quit Today

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO and NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
Magic was in the air as Bill Bradley returned to his hometown last September. Pundits and pollsters swooned, Vice President Al Gore's campaign was in disarray, and Mr. Bradley began his own presidential race with a speech as lofty as his plays as a high school basketball star in that very same gymnasium.
And then, of course, Mr. Bradley crashed back to earth. As one looks back to understand the collapse of his presidential bid, perhaps the most telling moment came not during Mr. Bradley's thoughtful speech that day in Crystal City, Mo., but rather in his encounter with Rita Thuesen. 
 Mrs. Thuesen, a slim, brown-haired woman who was Mr. Bradley's second-grade music teacher, went before the television cameras to describe the seed of a president in her old runny-nosed pupil. Then, as the crowd brimmed with emotion, she walked over to where Mr. Bradley and his wife, Ernestine, were sitting. If ever in the history of politics there was a hugging time, this was it.
"I stopped in front of them and told Ernestine that I hoped she would be dancing with Bill in the White House," Mrs. Thuesen recalled. "And Bill just sat and looked at us."
Eventually, Mr. Bradley's wife prodded him and he gave his teacher an awkward hug. But that emotional reserve, that profound detachment -- even shyness -- never left him, and his campaign faltered in part because he often failed to establish an emotional bond with voters.
Mr. Bradley will appear with his wife today in West Orange, N.J., to announce the inevitable -- that he is giving up a campaign that began with such promise, only to end without achieving a single primary victory.
The tale of how Mr. Bradley's campaign collapsed underscores a few lessons about American politics today.
First, as Gov. George W. Bush of Texas must be noticing, a sitting vice president with strong party backing is a formidable competitor and enjoys a huge advantage when the American economy is purring along in its longest expansion in history.
Second, voters may be angered by negative campaigning, but it works. In the fall, analysts bet that voters would be turned off by smarmy politicians fighting like wolverines, but in the end the public also seemed to want a candidate who could demonstrate that he was tough enough to defend himself.
Mr. Bradley's attempt to run a high-brow, high-minded campaign sometimes conveyed wimpiness, and one lesson may be that positive campaigners get torn apart by those wolverines.
Third, in the Democratic primaries, traditional constituencies like labor unions and members of minority groups still matter enormously.
In retrospect, one of the death blows to Mr. Bradley's campaign came just as it seemed to be taking off. The first primary, in a sense, came back in October when the A.F.L.-C.I.O. endorsed Mr. Gore.
At the time, though, Mr. Bradley was still rising in the polls, staying even with Mr. Gore in raising money and attracting admiring publicity from the news media. Mr. Bradley inspired some people with the impression that he was above politics, running less as a 21st-century politician than as an Old Testament prophet, and he deliberately packaged himself as the package-less candidate, wearing scruffy suits and disdaining the hurly-burly of political attacks and counterattacks.
Mr. Bradley set the tone at the first of his debates with Mr. Gore, in Bedford, N.H., in October. A woman asked Mr. Bradley to comment "on the behavior of the '96 Clinton-Gore campaign as it relates to fund-raising." An easier question could not have been lobbed at the candidate, but Mr. Bradley refused to swing.
"I think there were obviously some irregularities that have been addressed," Mr. Bradley said mildly, and he then noted that both candidates agree on some ideas to improve the campaign finance system.
Why the reluctance of Mr. Bradley to employ his best weapon, indignation at Mr. Gore's aggressive fund-raising?
"There was an ongoing discussion in the campaign in early October about the level of response and how much the candidate should be involved in the negativity," recalled one of Mr. Bradley's top advisers. The conclusion was that Mr. Bradley should stay above the fray, apparently for two reasons. The first was tactical, that Mr. Bradley would sully his appeal if he engaged in typical political brawls, and that commentators and journalists would keep the issue alive instead. The second was an apparently genuine distaste on Mr. Bradley's part for attack politics and a feeling that it was beneath him.
The high-mindedness appealed to many Democrats who were sick of conventional politics. But it also left a huge opening for Mr. Gore, who throughout his career has been gentlemanly when possible and a street fighter when necessary.
Delicately at first, Mr. Gore began taking jabs at Mr. Bradley. The vice president warned that Mr. Bradley's health care plan -- an ambitious proposal that was intended to help the poor and members of minority groups -- was too ambitious and would cost too much. Mr. Bradley did not hit back.
In mid-November, Mr. Gore raised the stakes. It was a sunny day in Pasadena, Calif., and Mr. Gore was fiery as he stood in his shirt sleeves and offered a different critique of his rival's health plan. The vice president told a gathering sponsored by an African-American group that Mr. Bradley was trying to "dismantle Medicaid" in ways that would hurt blacks, Latinos and the poor.
"Any plan that tears down Medicaid leaves African-Americans and Latinos out in the cold," Mr. Gore declared. He added: "I would call on Senator Bradley to reconsider a program that has such a harsh impact on low-income and working families in this country."
Mr. Bradley and his aides were stunned.
"I'm waiting for them to say Bill Bradley will push disabled people out of their wheelchairs," fumed Anita Dunn, Mr. Bradley's communications director. (Sure enough, Mr. Gore did eventually assert that the Bradley plan would hurt the disabled.)
Privately, Mr. Bradley was steaming. But the campaign simply released a measured statement accusing Mr. Gore of "scare tactics and divisiveness."
The lesson, for the Gore campaign, was that Mr. Bradley would not hit back. And so in the coming weeks, Mr. Gore began battering Mr. Bradley from every direction.
An underlying problem was that Mr. Bradley was not terribly good at taking advice. In contrast to President Ronald Reagan, who recruited first-rate campaign advisers and happily stood on the spot they marked for him to get the best television angle, Mr. Bradley attracted advisers who were as scornful of political games as he was. And while he listened to suggestions, Mr. Bradley acted in effect as his own campaign manager.
"His advisers reinforced Bill's worst tendencies," grumbled one aide, who asked not to be named but who, like others, now believes that bad campaign strategy helped sink their candidate.
Another senior aide said of the inner circle: "These people were always concerned about what their relationship with Bill would be, as opposed to just doing what it takes to win. It should have been, 'I don't care what you think of me, I want to win.' "
As the 2000 campaign unfolded, there came to be growing doubts among Democrats that Mr. Bradley had what it took to win -- especially the ruthlessness and the furious, uncompromising, tenacious lust for power.
With Mr. Gore slamming blow after blow at Mr. Bradley, and often distorting his positions, many of Mr. Bradley's field organizers were eager to fight back. But the candidate and his closest advisers -- all of whom believed that they needed to take the high road -- kept reining them in.
In New Hampshire, Mr. Bradley's state director, Mark Longabaugh, was seething with frustration as he watched Mr. Gore attack Mr. Bradley's health care plan as both too costly and inadequate. One day, when Mr. Gore visited a series of New Hampshire pharmacies to attack Mr. Bradley's health plan, Mr. Longabaugh had had enough.
Using his desktop computer, Mr. Longabaugh created a satire of a prescription form that caustically mocked the vice president. The form prescribed medicine for "Gore-itis," whose symptoms include "uncontrollable lying."
"Take a healthy dose daily, especially when talking about the Bill Bradley health plan," the sheet said. "Failure to do so may result in uncontrollable negative campaigning."
In sharp contrast to Mr. Bradley's muted response to attacks, the vice president personally complained about the flier. He accused the Bradley forces of campaigning by "personal invective."
Senior Bradley aides were appalled by the flier and feared that it would conflict with his positive message. So they ordered Mr. Longabaugh to apologize, and Mr. Bradley's campaign chairman, Douglas C. Berman, issued an apology of his own.
"This flier is not characteristic of Bill Bradley nor the style in which he has run this campaign," Mr. Berman said in a statement.
The retraction was barely noticed at the time. But within both campaigns it became a symbol of how easy it was for the Gore campaign to shove Mr. Bradley without getting pushed back.
One of Mr. Bradley's mistakes, apparently unchallenged by his close aides, was the decision to devote huge resources to the Iowa caucuses. The caucuses have always treated insurgents poorly, and Mr. Gore had a huge advantage because of his A.F.L.-C.I.O. endorsement and the resulting wave of labor organizers working for him.
Yet Mr. Bradley devoted much of January to campaigning in Iowa, and he spent more than $1.3 million on commercials there, believing that a strong showing would give him momentum going into the New Hampshire primary one week later. It became evident very quickly that the strategy was not working, but Mr. Bradley's campaign then underscored another of its fundamental weaknesses: it was not flexible.
Instead of changing plans and skipping Iowa, as John McCain did on the Republican side, Mr. Bradley slogged on. It was an approach that friends say had carried him through life. Each time he got in trouble, he buckled down and worked harder. That technique rescued him when he first arrived at Princeton University and found himself at sea academically, and it worked again when he first joined the New York Knicks and initially played poorly.
"He had his own view of how things were going to go, and I'd never seen him so confident as at the start," recalled an old friend. "He was so high on his expectations, and then he didn't act well when a couple of things went wrong. As a young man, he had a tendency to get moody when his performance wasn't perfect. In his early career in the pro's, he was like that."
Moodiness plays even worse in politics than in basketball, however. And his old techniques of improving himself no longer worked. After losing a game, Mr. Bradley would go out the next morning and drill with a ferocious discipline, sinking 25 baskets in a row first from one place on the court, then another and so on.
In Iowa, however, practice did not make perfect. And meanwhile, Mr. Gore was proving far more flexible a campaigner than anyone had imagined. Terrified by Mr. Bradley's successes, Mr. Gore revamped his campaign, honed his message and became a far more dynamic campaigner.
The two armies had a decisive clash in Iowa at a debate Jan. 9, where Mr. Gore used a remarkably effective technique: he called on a farmer in the audience, Chris Peterson, asked him to stand up, and then asked Mr. Bradley, "Why did you vote against the disaster relief for Chris Peterson when he and thousands of other farmers here in Iowa needed it after those '93 floods?"
The attack was deeply unfair, because Mr. Bradley had in fact voted in favor of the flood assistance. He had voted against an amendment for additional aid, but the Clinton administration had also opposed that amendment until the last minute. Instead of pointing this out, Mr. Bradley tried to change the subject.
There were times, however, when Mr. Bradley more than held his own in debates. On the NBC News program "Meet the Press" in December, Mr. Bradley showed uncharacteristic steeliness when he brushed aside Mr. Gore's handshake offer to stop using radio and television commercials.
And in a New Hampshire debate in early January, Mr. Bradley offered the more nuanced answer about gays in the military, saying he would not make the issue a "litmus test" in nominating members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Mr. Gore said that he would, a position he hastily backed away from amid criticism from military leaders.
Increasingly, Mr. Bradley -- after rapturous initial coverage in the news media -- began to be portrayed in print and on the airwaves as remote, out of touch and even arrogant and gruff. While other candidates went out of their way to win the hearts and minds of journalists, complimenting them on their questions with such conviction that one might almost think they were sincere, Mr. Bradley often greeted tough questions with scorn. And he seemed to think he could manage the news, even though it regularly upended him.
Mr. Bradley had never disclosed that he for the last few years he had suffered an irregular heart beat, a common condition known as atrial fibrillation. Aides said he had planned to release full medical information in January. But his heart interfered with that timing: he had to check into a hospital in December when his heart began thumping out of beat, and so the news poured out in a deluge that made him seem both feeble and secretive.
The Bradley campaign also held back potentially valuable cards even when it was in trouble. Michael Jordan, the basketball superstar, cut a commercial for Mr. Bradley in late December, but the campaign did not run it until February, when Mr. Bradley was already in a tailspin.
In the end, Mr. Gore won the Iowa caucuses on Jan. 24 by 63 percent to 35 percent. It was not particularly discreditable in a state like Iowa, but it came across as a major defeat.
In New Hampshire, Mr. Bradley found himself with another problem: the far more glamorous candidacy of John McCain. In what is now seen by his aides as a major error, Mr. Bradley had met with Mr. McCain in a joint appearance to demand campaign finance reform, giving Mr. McCain credibility at a time few were paying any attention to him.
Mr. McCain and Mr. Bradley were both running as insurgents against the political system, and both were running in part on biography. Mr. Bradley's Hall-of-Fame background had seemed about as amazing a past as a politician could have, but Mr. McCain was the one candidate who could trump him in that category.
In New Hampshire, with its open primary, voters became excited by Mr. McCain in a way that they did not with Mr. Bradley. Not only did Mr. McCain siphon off votes of independents from Mr. Bradley, he also siphoned away media attention. There might have been room for one rebel with a great biography in the campaign, but there was not room for two -- especially when the second sometimes had trouble working a crowd.
On the evening of the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Bradley addressed a raucous crowd of several hundred volunteers in a college gymnasium. The supporters repeatedly interrupted Mr. Bradley to cheer and chant their support, but each time he sternly waved his hands to hush them.
Finally Sheila Wellstone, wife of Senator Paul Wellstone of Minnesota, tried to sustain that enthusiasm by doing an end run around Mr. Bradley. Each time Mr. Bradley motioned for the crowd to be quiet, she would raise her hands to urge fans to keep the applause coming.
In the end, Mr. Bradley lost the New Hampshire primary by four percentage points. Labor unions -- which had vigorously campaigned for Mr. Gore -- helped provide the vice president with the margin of victory.
"Bradley had floated above politics, and he thought he could float above the campaign," said Fred Siegel, a professor of history at the Cooper Union for Arts and Sciences. "Suppose he had run campaign ads with shots of the Buddhist temple" -- a reminder of the illegal campaign contributions raised when Mr. Gore visited with Chinese Buddhists in California. "He could have won New Hampshire."
Mr. Bradley's performance was still impressive for an outsider, better than Eugene McCarthy's in 1968 that forced President Lyndon B. Johnson to quit the race. But whereas Bill Clinton managed to lose New Hampshire in 1992 and "spin" it as a victory, proclaiming himself "the come-back kid," Mr. Bradley was simply cast as the loser.
Just as important, the news the next day -- and in the next few weeks -- was not about Mr. Bradley but about Mr. McCain's amazing 19-point victory in New Hampshire and his challenge to Mr. Bush. The Democratic race had a five-week lull after New Hampshire, and so all attention turned to the vicious battle on the Republican side. Mr. Bradley vanished from the airwaves.
As the campaign wore on, Mr. Bradley abandoned his focus on the positive and began blasting Mr. Gore for distorting Mr. Bradley's record as well as his own. But while Mr. Gore could knife an opponent with warmth, grace and apparent reluctance, the newly negative Mr. Bradley came across as petulant and strident, and his shift from one extreme to the other seemed to be desperation.
"When he felt things slipping away slightly, he did things like going negative," recalls an old friend. "But when he heard the words he was saying and saw himself on TV doing this, I think he got depressed. He hated himself."
The few photographers left covering Mr. Bradley became frustrated that their standard photos -- Mr. Bradley waving exultantly to a crowd, or shaking hands with a beaming supporter -- never saw light of print. One photographer said that he found that the best way to get newspapers to use his pictures was to transmit shots showing Mr. Bradley looking alone or dejected.
"They didn't want the rah-rah shots any more," the photographer said. "I realized I had to start sending shots that reflected the tone of the stories, which was negative."
Indeed, perhaps the most memorable photo of the Bradley campaign -- taken by a different photographer -- was a haunting shot of the candidate on a ferry in Washington State recently, surrounded by commuters but standing alone in his own world, gripping a cup of coffee.
In some respects, the collapse of Mr. Bradley's campaign obscures its accomplishments. Mr. Bradley contributed mightily to setting the Democratic agenda by pressing Mr. Gore to talk more than he had planned about health care, poverty, race relations, gay rights and gun control.
Mr. Bradley also mounted an unusually potent challenge against a sitting vice president in a time of economic plenty, briefly shaking the foundations of the Democratic establishment.
In the end, however, Mr. Bradley never managed to attract core constituencies. Labor remained behind Mr. Gore, and so did most black voters, in both cases repaying a sense of loyalty to the Clinton administration. And unlike Mr. Gore, who over the course of the campaign turned from wooden to flesh as surely as Pinocchio in the movie, Mr. Bradley never lost his reserve and rarely linked at an emotional level with voters.
In Tacoma, Wash., a few weeks ago, Mr. Bradley spoke to a group of children and began interviewing them, eliciting vivid tales of seeing people shot with guns. It was wrenching to listen to, but when they finished Mr. Bradley simply nodded, turned away and returned to his dry speech.
Mr. Bradley's oldest friends in Crystal City are saddened by this inability to connect with voters, but not particularly surprised. They describe him as a mix of his parents: Susan, vivacious and fun, is reflected in the humor and warmth that he shows among small groups of people, and Warren, the reserved, Victorian gentleman, emerges in more formal settings like with a larger audience or in a television appearance.
"This is how he was raised," said Carol Cunningham, Mr. Bradley's next-door neighbor in childhood. "Years of conditioning would make it very hard for him to change.
"Hugging your second-grade teacher? You've got to understand how we were raised. She's a person of respect. You wouldn't hug her. She's still Mrs. Thuesen."

HEADLINE: Greenspan In Warning About Loans

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, sounded his second warning note about the economy this week, cautioning bankers today to avoid making loans on the expectation that the record-breaking expansion would continue unabated.
The remarks to a bankers' group in San Antonio appeared to be the latest efforts by federal regulators to forestall a repeat of the savings and loan crisis of the late 1980's and early 1990's. In that debacle, lax lending, aggressive expansion into new lines of business and fraud at some savings and loans eventually cost the government hundreds of billions of dollars. 
 Mr. Greenspan said there was a "troubling trend" for many banks to take the strong economy for granted.
"Lending granted on that basis could have grave consequences for the industry's ability to weather weaker economic conditions," he said in a text of his speech to the Independent Community Bankers of America.
Mr. Greenspan's remarks came two days after he publicly expressed concern that the nation's record-breaking economic expansion could be ended by a resurgence of inflation unless growth slowed to a more sustainable level.
Private economists viewed Mr. Greenspan's comments on Monday, which were made in a speech at Boston College, as a clear signal that the central bank, which already increased interest rates four times since June, would do so again.
The Fed has pushed the federal funds rate, the interest that banks charge each other on overnight loans, up a full percentage point, to 5.75 percent, over the last eight months. That in turn has lifted commercial banks' prime lending rate, the benchmark for millions of business and consumer loans, a full percentage point, to 8.75 percent, its highest level in nearly five years.
Mr. Greenspan noted today that even with the strong economy, the federal deposit insurance funds had recently had some big losses caused by lenient lending standards and fraud at banks.
Eight United States banks failed last year.

HEADLINE: Germans Try A Second Run At I.M.F. Post

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
Defying warnings that history might repeat itself, Germany began a diplomatic offensive to install one of its nationals as head of the International Monetary Fund and received a generally lukewarm reception today in both Europe and the United States.
Chancellor Gerhard Schroder began lobbying European neighbors and the United States to support Horst Kohler, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to head the I.M.F. But Mr. Schroder misjudged, if he expected that his nation's allies would quickly rally around the new German candidate after the first one he promoted was forced to give up a four-month quest to lead the monetary fund. 
 President Clinton pointedly declined to endorse Mr. Kohler in a telephone conversation with the German chancellor Tuesday. White House officials said the president had a friendly conversation with Mr. Schroder in which he took a neutral position on Mr. Kohler's qualifications for the job.
European officials also have not rushed to Germany's side. Italy's foreign minister, Lamberto Dini, delivered a frank public assessment in which he said that Mr. Kohler was "less than had been hoped for." A spokesman for Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain said Europe had not rallied behind Mr. Kohler, who once served as a close aide to Helmut Kohl, Mr. Schroder's longtime rival and predecessor as chancellor.
French and Portuguese officials made much more positive comments. But it seemed unlikely that Germany could forge an immediate Europewide consensus that Mr. Kohler ought to be the region's unified choice to lead the I.M.F.
It is possible that Germany's decision to throw its considerable political heft behind a new candidate and campaign publicly for him will work this time.
Some German allies, including the United States, are eager to avoid the impression that they are picking fights with Germany, and Mr. Kohler is widely considered a better choice than the previous candidate, Caio Koch-Weser, Germany's deputy finance minister.
But it also seemed possible that Germany, by choosing a person who does not top the lists of Europe's most qualified and politically prominent financial officials, had set itself up for another stinging defeat. That is especially true because both European and American officials have put a high priority on finding someone who can quickly command support and end the prolonged and divisive search for an I.M.F. managing director.
Late last week, the 182 member nations of the I.M.F. rebuffed Germany when they denied Mr. Koch-Weser, a close ally of Mr. Schroder, a majority of their votes in an informal poll. Mr. Koch-Weser had the backing of the 15-nation European Union, which has named every I.M.F. managing director since the financial institution was created just after World War II. But Europe's support was tepid, and Mr. Clinton went public with his vow to stop the German's candidacy after months of quiet diplomacy failed to dissuade Germany from promoting him.
The United States and other critics had argued that Mr. Koch-Weser, a 25-year veteran of the World Bank and a specialist in poverty relief, did not have the political stature or the financial expertise to head the I.M.F., which has been likened to a world central bank.
Mr. Koch-Weser's lack of experience in finance or monetary policy was considered glaring because the I.M.F. has been under pressure -- from Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, among others -- to focus primarily on its role as a crisis-manager for nations hit by temporary financial panic. Critics have urged that it get out of the business of providing long-term loans, development assistance and poverty relief, the sorts of programs that are the specialty of the World Bank.
Mr. Kohler has considerably more financial expertise than Mr. Koch-Weser and is better known around Europe. But like Mr. Koch-Weser he has also spent much of his career overseeing development and aid programs, suggesting that he does not have the ideal background to counter some of the criticisms aimed at his fellow German.
Mr. Kohler, 57, was long allied with the Christian Democratic Union, the party that Mr. Schroder defeated when he took power last year. He served as an economic assistant to Mr. Kohl.
In the early 1990's, Mr. Kohler served in the No. 2 position at Germany's finance ministry, the position Mr. Koch-Weser holds today. In that job, Mr. Kohler helped manage Germany's financial relations with Europe at a time when the region was working out the details of monetary union. But he was better known for helping to arrange the terms of unification with the formerly Communist East Germany, and then overseeing a huge injection of public funds aimed at rebuilding the region. He also had a stint in the private sector, managing Germany's federation of savings banks.
Mr. Kohler now heads the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, a mini-World Bank that backs development projects and businesses in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. He took the post just after the quasi-public bank wrote off tens of millions of dollars worth of loans when Russia, its leading client, defaulted on its debt in the summer of 1998.
Clinton administration officials have declined to comment on Mr. Kohler's candidacy. Moreover, they seem determined to avoid a repeat of their role in defeating Mr. Koch-Weser, when Mr. Clinton publicly played the heavy while some European countries hid their true feelings behind the veil of European solidarity.
But administration officials were also hoping that Europe would select a candidate who would obviate the need for extended debate. Among the several senior politicians in Europe talked about as potential candidates are the current and former British chancellors of the exchequer and the Italian finance minister.
"We support a European candidate, a candidate of maximum stature, who can generate a consensus in Europe and support from developing countries," the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said today when asked about Germany's push for Mr. Kohler.

HEADLINE: Biden Joins G.O.P. in Call for Delay in Missile-Defense Plan

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 8

 BODY:
Adding weight to a growing bipartisan movement, a senior Democratic senator has warned President Clinton that he should leave the decision on deploying a national missile-defense system to the next administration.
Senator Joseph R. Biden Jr., the Democrat from Delaware who is the ranking minority member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told an audience of scientists on Friday at Stanford University that he did not believe that the North Korean missile threat was sufficient to warrant a vastly expensive system that was not technically proven. 
 Further, Mr. Biden said deploying the system could not only severely upset relations with Russia, but also encourage China to increase sharply its warheads, prompting an arms race in Asia.
Mr. Clinton is scheduled to make a decision on a national missile-defense system in the summer. His top arms negotiators have been talking to the Russians over six months about deploying the system in a way that Moscow might find acceptable.
Mr. Biden stated his opposition after Chuck Hagel, a Republican from Nebraska on the Foreign Relations Committee, called for a delay until a new president took office.
Henry A. Kissinger recently wrote that an election year was not the time to proceed on national missile defense.
Mr. Biden, who amplified his comments on Monday in an interview, also cited election year politics as a reason for postponing a decision. Mr. Biden said that
 he disagreed with White House advisers who say Vice President Al Gore and the Democrats need to proceed with the system to inoculate themselves against Republican criticism of being weak on national defense and that the Democrats would be most successful by campaigning on the strength of the economy, and not allowing the Republicans to turn the focus to foreign policy.
"This is going to cost $30 billion, and there has been no national debate," Mr. Biden added. "This doesn't make sense absent public debate."
In explaining his opposition to Mr. Clinton's making a far-reaching foreign-policy decision under such time pressure, Mr. Biden said he was particularly uneasy with the missile-defense system because he thought that it would essentially mean withdrawal from the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1972.
That treaty, which its advocates regard as the cornerstone of arms control, forbids a missile-defense system that protects an entire nation. The administration has been trying to persuade acting President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia to amend the ABM treaty so that Mr. Clinton could decide on a system without scrapping the pact. Russia has shown few signs of agreeing.
In his interview, Mr. Biden said he had an alternative idea to answer the threat from North Korea's Taepo Dong missiles, which are believed to be able to deliver strategic warheads to the United States.
Mr. Biden said an Aegis sea-based system with missiles based off the North Korean coast would let the United States intercept the missiles in their ascents. Such a system would not endanger the whole fabric of arms control or threaten nonproliferation safeguards in the way that a national missile defense would, Mr. Biden said.
When Mr. Biden spoke at Stanford, former Defense Secretary William S. Perry was in the audience. Mr. Perry has also expressed reservations about the system's being the best way to counter the threat of long-range missiles from North Korea and in Congressional testimony favored the sea-based system off North Korea.

HEADLINE: Mayor Says School Board's Base Is for Sale, Study or No

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced yesterday that the city was aggressively seeking a buyer for 110 Livingston Street, the Board of Education's decrepit and maligned headquarters in downtown Brooklyn, and that he was not going to wait for the board's study exploring the possibility of a sale.
"Study!" Mr. Giuliani said derisively at a news briefing. "That's what the city used to be doing. It used to study itself to death." He added that although the board must approve the sale of the city-owned building, "we're going to push this process to the limit" and that the city "can put together a whole deal" for the board. Asked if he could go forward at this point without board approval, Mr. Giuliani said, "Damn right we can." 
 Board officials responded that the mayor was trying to pick a fight and get attention. One board member said that Mr. Giuliani was resentful that control of the city's education agenda had shifted to Harold O. Levy, the interim chancellor whose appointment the mayor opposed.
"We set up a process to take a look at the sale of the buildings, and we're going to stay with that process," said William C. Thompson Jr., the board president.
Mr. Levy, who telephoned the mayor shortly after his appointment in January but has yet to have his call returned, had little comment yesterday in the latest chapter of the continuous conflict between Mr. Giuliani and a board that the mayor regularly says should be abolished.
"I have been directed by the Board of Education to conduct a strategic review of both the board's facilities and its staffing, with a deadline of June 2000," Mr. Levy said in a two-sentence statement issued by his office. "Until that review is completed, it would be premature to comment on any efforts to sell the current board headquarters building."
Privately, board members said they were not going to let the situation escalate by biting at what they described as Mr. Giuliani's bait.
The mayor made his announcement at an elaborate City Hall news conference, complete with pictures and charts showing the three buildings that make up the board's headquarters in downtown Brooklyn: 110 Livingston Street, 131 Livingston Street and 65 Court Street. The three buildings are close to each other but not contiguous, and Mr. Giuliani gave no figures as to their worth.
The best known of the buildings is 110 Livingston Street, where Mr. Levy and the board members have offices. It is a former Elks lodge designed in the late 1920's by the legendary firm of McKim, Mead & White -- after the three famous architects who gave the firm its name were dead. The American Institute of Architects Guide to New York City describes the building as "pallid and boring."
Mr. Giuliani took on the tone of a real estate agent with an excellent deal to offer yesterday. "This is an area of the city that has gone through an amazing transformation over the last four or five years," the mayor said enthusiastically of downtown Brooklyn, adding that the city would extend tax breaks to buyers.
"So these are pieces of real estate that should have a great deal of interest," the mayor concluded.
Officially, the action of the mayor was an announcement that the city has issued a Request for Expressions of Interest, the first step in attracting bids from developers for the buildings. Michael G. Carey, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said he hoped to have the buildings sold by the end of the year.
After the news conference, Mr. Carey said that it was possible that a buyer would acquire the property while Board of Education employees were still working in the buildings and that it would be up to the new landlord to decide how to proceed.
Mr. Giuliani first announced that he wanted to sell 110 Livingston Street during his State of the City speech in January, which people took as a joke. Yesterday Mr. Giuliani's critics said that the sale was a gimmick and not a solution. "The change of address is not enough," said Peter F. Vallone, the speaker of the City Council.
Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mr. Giuliani's opponent for United States Senate, responded with a three-page news release outlining what she described as the mayor's failures on education.

HEADLINE: Perils of an Asian War

 BODY:

To the Editor:
David Shambaugh, in "China Is All Bluster on Taiwan (for Now)" (Op-Ed, March 6), presents cogent arguments for why China is not well prepared to attack Taiwan. But he disregards the economic reality that the world has become highly dependent on electronic products produced in Taiwan and China, often by Chinese affiliates of Taiwanese companies.
China, Taiwan and the United States would suffer serious economic damage from a war. So would the rest of the world, with its ever-increasing use of electronic and computer technology. 
 It is to be hoped that cooler diplomatic heads will continue to prevail. A full-scale war in Asia would most certainly have heavy casualties.
It could also bring about a collapse of the computer industry, a return to the multi-thousand-dollar computer prices of 10 years ago and the possiblity of a worldwide economic depression.

HEADLINE: Foreign Affairs;
The Water's Edge

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
So I was starting to envy the political reporters, because there seemed to be no foreign policy in this year's presidential primary campaign. But then I realized that there was no policy in this campaign, let alone foreign policy, so there was really nothing to envy. So far, this has been a campaign about campaigning -- who has the best ad strategy for distorting the other guy's position and re-inventing his own in order to mislead voters. We had a primary in New York in which people actually discussed whether John McCain was for or against breast cancer, and George W. Bush, who presides over one of the most polluted states in the nation, ran as the candidate from Greenpeace.
I realize that distortion is part of campaigning, but when did it become campaigning? I guess the true measure of how little foreign policy figured in the primaries was the fact that none of the candidates felt impelled to even distort the other's foreign-policy positions. 
 The absence of foreign policy is due in part to the relative peace and prosperity America now enjoys, but there are other factors at play. To begin with, the substantive differences between the center of the Democratic and Republican parties on many key foreign-policy questions has narrowed. Face it, President Clinton has done to the Republicans on foreign policy exactly what he did to them on domestic policy: He took all their favorite issues and left them with the garbage. The Republicans wanted NATO expansion, so Mr. Clinton expanded NATO. The Republicans initiated Nafta, and Mr. Clinton got it ratified. The Republicans were in favor of ballistic-missile defense, so Mr. Clinton made it part of the Democratic plank too. There aren't a lot of global wedge issues left.
The differences have also narrowed because some of the key issues have become too complicated to distort. They are so complex they don't fit on a bumper sticker at all. You'd need the whole bumper to describe them.
America's obvious national interest today is sustainable globalization. Just that term is a mouthful. But the fact is, it's America's products, technologies, ideas, values, culture and style of capitalism that are being most globalized today. So surely our overriding interest is to keep that going -- by both stabilizing the world system militarily and democratizing it economically and politically, so that more people in more places benefit from this globalization.
That's the theory. The practice is even more complicated, particularly in an age when Americans are held responsible for everything in the world but don't want to die for anything. As such, the practice of sustainable globalization is a quirky combination of cruise missiles and Web servers. It means deploying classic deterrence against Iraq; pursuing arms control, I.M.F. aid and containment vis-a-vis Russia; combining gunboats, trade and Internet investment to move China along; and deterrence and potatoes to induce North Korea not to go nuclear. It is not heroic stuff, but so far it's kept the peace and globalization alive.
Finally, the differences have narrowed because for a lot of citizens the biggest foreign-policy issue is now the biggest domestic issue: education. Just as the Soviet launch of Sputnik elevated the importance of science education in the early cold war, the onset of globalization and intensified economic competition is elevating the importance of technology education today. In the cold war we thought we had to get smarter to survive in a world of walls, and in this era of globalization we think we need to get smarter to survive in a world without walls.
If you look at the center of both parties, argues Robert Pastor, an Emory University political scientist, what's left that really differentiates them is attitude -- "how they define American leadership" -- with the Democrats tending to believe that the best way to pursue our interests is by working with coalitions of allies, the U.N. and through international treaties, and the Republicans at least talking about more unilateral approaches and rejecting treaties, such as the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. But how much even those differences are real and how much they grow out of who's in office and who's not is unclear.
Bottom line: Both George W. Bush and Al Gore would drive with roughly the same foreign-policy map. It's really a question of who you'd trust with the car keys.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Hard to believe, but the direct marketer Draft Worldwide will acquire the iconoclastic AG.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
IN an odd coupling that makes Felix and Oscar seem almost like clones, Draft Worldwide, a giant direct marketing agency owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies, is joining forces with AG Worldwide, the brand strategy and advertising agency owned by the iconoclastic creative executive Peter Arnell.
Draft, based in Chicago, is expected to announce formally today that it is acquiring a majority stake in AG, based in New York, for undisclosed terms. AG is known for developing and strengthening brand identities for advertisers like Banana Republic, Hanes hosiery, Tommy Hilfiger, Donna Karan, Ray-Ban and Samsung. Draft handles direct and promotional marketing accounts with estimated billings of $2.7 billion for clients like American Express, Compaq, General Motors, Stamps.com and the United States Postal Service. 
 The primary goal of the deal, which calls for AG to operate as an autonomous unit of Draft, is to improve client service offerings of both agencies. Draft, known for hard-working direct sales pitches, is hoping to benefit from AG's penchant for producing brand images perceived as chic and trendy.
"Over the last five years, direct and promotional marketers have been forced to become builders of brands," said Howard Draft, chairman and chief executive at Draft. "You've got to sell the product and build the brand at the same time.
"Where our clients are pushing us is more to Peter's model," he added, "powerful creative that drives results immediately."
Draft, which has made a skein of acquisitions since being bought by Interpublic in 1996, also seeks to capitalize on the Internet marketing experience of an AG subsidiary, Surge Interactive. Draft, which now handles interactive marketing in-house, is also acquiring a majority stake in Surge, where Chad Stoller, 28, will continue as president.
"We both recognize the shift to a digital economy," said Jordan H. Rednor, president and worldwide chief operating officer at Draft. "Direct marketing is where the Web is today, a one-to-one dialogue with consumers, and Surge will serve as a bridge between our cultures."
AG, for its part, is hoping to benefit from the Draft abilities to develop so-called direct response campaigns as well as access to the Draft worldwide network, composed of 3,200 employees in 25 countries.
"We have a lot of multinational clients," said Mr. Arnell, chairman and executive creative director at AG, which also has offices in London and Tokyo, "but there has been strong resistance to allowing us to manage brands globally.
"We really felt we had to get into the larger world," he added, which can now be accomplished by opening AG outposts in Draft offices overseas. Current AG clients, in addition to Samsung, include Consolidated Edison, Indulge.com, Playboy Enterprises, Polaroid, the Rockport division of Reebok International and the Universal Music Group unit of the Seagram Company.
As disparate as the new partners are, Messrs. Arnell, Draft and Rednor offered several explanations for their unexpected cohabitation.
"Howard understands who we are and wants us to be more of who we are," said Mr. Arnell, 40, who joins the Draft executive committee.
Mr. Arnell is known for his photography and design projects as well as iconic ad ideas. He listed among his and his agency's signature work the poster for Samsung showing "a beautiful boy holding a microwave oven"; a commercial for Chanel No. 5 "bringing Marilyn Monroe back from the dead" by inserting footage of her into contemporary settings; and print ads for fashion brands like DKNY photographed in black and white rather than color.
Mr. Arnell is also known as an independent-minded executive who is never shy about trying to get his way. His voluble disagreements with clients and employees are a staple of Madison Avenue gossip.
"I'm a brash, entrepreneurial spirit," Mr. Arnell said. So can he work for someone else, particularly someone owned by Interpublic, the behemoth agency company headed by the gruff, no-nonsense Philip H. Geier Jr.? "It's probably one of the most unusual marriages you've ever heard," Mr. Arnell said. "That's what's so hot about it."
Besides, he added, if the partnership fails, "in the next couple years you'll have a good story to write."
Mr. Draft, 46, laughed as he suggested a headline for this column: " 'Hard to believe,' " then added, "We at Draft are pretty independent guys, too. The last thing I'd want is not to have Peter come into the office every morning and feel he's in charge," Mr. Draft said, adding that Mr. Geier endorsed the deal by declaring " 'Go for it.' "
Mr. Rednor, 45, said he found more similarities between Draft and AG than might be evident at first glance.
Both agencies are about the same age, he said, Draft dating to 1978 and AG to 1979. And both have gone by many monikers. Previous Draft names include Kobs & Brady and Draft Direct. Previous AG names include Arnell Group Brand Consulting and Arnell/Bickford.
Mr. Arnell said he became acquainted with Draft through Mr. Rednor, a friend for 15 years.
In a previous career, Mr. Rednor was "in charge of the advertising group at Chemical Bank," Mr. Arnell recalled, "and when we didn't have a line of credit -- or a MasterCard or Visa -- we had Jordan."

HEADLINE: A Good Trade Deal With China

 BODY:
Congress should quickly approve legislation needed to smooth China's admission to the World Trade Organization. By helping China into the W.T.O., lawmakers would not be endorsing Beijing's policies in other areas, like human rights and Taiwan. They would be speeding the opening and reform of China's economy and subordinating Beijing's arbitrary authority in trade matters to the rule of international law.
What President Clinton seeks from Congress is a change in China's trade status under American law. Currently, China's access to normal trading privileges in the American market is subject to annual Congressional review. Under the bill submitted this week, China, as a prospective member of the W.T.O., would be granted normal trading status on a permanent basis. 
 In years past, some members of Congress used the annual debates over China's trade privileges to challenge Beijing's human rights record and other offensive behavior. But linking these issues to trade made no obvious sense and produced scant results. More recently, the Clinton administration has wisely separated its efforts to open Chinese markets from other aspects of Washington's relations with Beijing. That has allowed the administration to support trade policies that serve American interests, while opposing Chinese actions that conflict with American values or threaten regional peace.
Last November the White House negotiated a highly favorable deal with China on W.T.O. admission terms. Beijing committed itself to end export subsidies and open its markets more fully to American farmers, telecommunications companies and financial institutions. By joining the trade organization, China will invite international scrutiny of its performance in keeping those pledges.
Senate approval of the needed changes in trade law seems likely. But the outlook in the House is less promising. At this point, only 50 to 60 House Democrats are willing to break ranks with organized labor, which strongly opposes the legislation because it wants continued annual review of China's harsh labor practices and denial of political freedoms. These are legitimate concerns, but best addressed outside the trade status legislation. At least 20 more Democratic votes are needed, since many Republicans who might otherwise have voted yes have been alienated by Beijing's recent noisy threats against Taiwan.
Unless Congress approves the China trade legislation by the end of this spring, the issue is likely to get caught up in campaign politics and delayed until next year. By then, China might back off from some of the market-opening concessions it is now offering. Neither the Taiwan issue nor labor's misplaced opposition should hold up an early, positive vote. The China trade bill serves broad American interests and deserves strong bipartisan support.

Nasdaq Market at 5,000: Volatility as Way of Life

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
Seldom has an index risen as rapidly as the Nasdaq composite has done in leaping above the 5,000 mark, a hurdle it surmounted yesterday little more than four months after it first pushed past 3,000. Virtually never has an index done so with such huge volatility.
The Nasdaq composite index gained 149.60 points, or 3.1 percent, to 5,046.86 yesterday after having first traded over the mark on Tuesday, only to fall below 4,750 during trading Wednesday before it again began climbing. 
 That move has been largely concentrated in only a handful of sectors within the market -- biotechnology, computer technology and telecommunications. Other sectors have generally lost value during the period, as the decision of the Federal Reserve Board to push up interest rates has taken a toll.
Indexes of stocks that are not so concentrated in technology have done much worse. While the Nasdaq composite is up 67 percent since Nov. 3, 1999, the day it first closed over 3,000, the Dow Jones industrial average is down 6 percent over the same period, and the Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks has risen just 3 percent.
While most stocks were falling, the enthusiasm for the "new economy," dominated by the Internet, has only increased among investors in recent months. And the performance of those stocks has not matched that of biotechnology issues, which have nothing to do with the Internet but which have suddenly come alive in their strongest performance since 1992, when biotechnology stocks dominated market speculation.
Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has made it clear that he expects to keep raising interest rates until the economy slows, and he has forecast that the stock market's surge will slow or reverse, thus dampening the wealth effect that has spurred consumer spending.
In a speech in Boston on Monday, Mr. Greenspan said the market was "groping for the appropriate valuation of these companies" and noted that "many analysts are now projecting that the rate of increase in stock market wealth may soon begin to slow." In fact, that has happened for most stocks, but the speculative fervor in favored stocks has continued unabated, and margin debt -- the money borrowed to buy stocks -- has begun to rise sharply.
As the number of shares that are rising has narrowed, pressure has grown on money managers to buy the stocks that are working and to shun the stocks that are not. That pressure has been intensified by mutual fund investors, who have pulled money out of many funds that have been poor performers while pouring cash into funds that have been rising.
"Right now, valuation measures are being thrown out the window," said Phillip Coburn, a strategist at Warburg Dillon Read. He said that the average price of technology stocks, using a measure that compares price-earnings multiples with earnings growth rates, is now twice what investors deemed reasonable only a couple of years ago.
Nonetheless, he said, money managers are only being prudent when they load up on technology stocks. "Given the fact that I don't see the end in sight, I don't think they are being foolish," he said. "They are being practical, and they are making money for their clients."
As the market has narrowed, even some of the large technology stocks that had been market leaders have begun to falter. Qualcomm, Dell Computer and Microsoft, all stars last year, are down in 2000.
Those losses have been made up for by many other stocks, however. "We've had this change to lower-quality growth," said Robert Farrell, a senior investment adviser at Merrill Lynch. "We do have a hierarchy of big tech stocks, but big tech is giving way to smaller tech, to anything that has a good story."
Among the winners, the Nasdaq computer index is up 26 percent and the Nasdaq telecommunications index has risen 19 percent since the end of 1999.
But those gains have paled next to those of the Nasdaq biotech index, which has risen 63 percent this year and has leaped 144 percent since last Nov. 3, the day the Nasdaq composite first topped 3,000. That is more than double the impressive move of the overall Nasdaq index.
But this week the Nasdaq biotech index has fallen 10 percent, without much in the way of news to explain the action. But then there was not that much news to explain the increase, other than growing investor enthusiasm for the potential profits from new drugs.
That volatility has beset the overall Nasdaq market as well. One way to measure such volatility is to look at the number of days when the Nasdaq index has closed with a gain or loss of at least 3 percent from the prior day, as it did yesterday. So far this year there have been 12 such days -- six up and six down, an average of more than one a week.
By contrast, during the eight years from 1988 through 1995, there were 10 such days, an average of slightly over one a year. Even last year, when Nasdaq's volatility was greater than at any time in the past, there were just 20 such days, an average of less than two a month.
That volatility has reflected the different forces competing for investor attention. Some days the hopes for exciting new technologies drive prices up. But on other days most Nasdaq stocks succumb to the same concerns, often about higher interest rates, that have bedeviled many other stocks.
The real losers have been stocks that are vulnerable to higher interest rates but have no competing technological allure. So far this year, the Nasdaq bank index is down 19 percent and the Nasdaq insurance index has lost 14 percent.
Data from AMG Data Services, which tracks mutual fund cash flows, shows that through March 8 funds specializing in the hot areas -- aggressive growth, technology, small cap and biotech -- had garnered 76 percent of the $93 billion investors have put into stock funds. At that rate, said Robert Adler, the president of AMG, the annual record for stock fund inflows will be broken by the end of this month. In 1999, those hot sectors took in 41 percent of the money invested in stock funds, up from 10 percent in 1998, he said.
"The massive inflows into the mutual funds are going into a narrow group of funds," said L. Keith Mullins, who specializes in small stocks as an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. "Clearly, money is chasing performance."

HEADLINE: Las Vegas Glitz Is Set to Go West;
Tribes in California Scramble to Expand Casinos After Vote

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: COACHELLA, Calif., March 9

 BODY:
The modest Indian gambling hall near a truck stop here in the California desert has little of the flamboyance of Donald J. Trump's Taj Mahal in Atlantic City or of numerous Las Vegas resorts. About the only glitz is provided by illuminated star-shaped wall plaques autographed by Tom Jones, Crystal Gale, Shirley Bassey and other entertainers who have performed at the casino's combination theater-bingo hall.
"The Taj has incredible crystal chandeliers that will absolutely knock your eyes out," said Charles J. Irwin, general manager of the casino, the Spotlight 29, and a former vice chairman of the New Jersey Casino Control Commission. "The Vegas places have water effects and pirate ships and that kind of thing. This is just a small Indian casino." 
 But maybe not for long. On Wednesday, Trump Hotels and Casino Resorts announced that it had signed a letter of intent with the Twenty-Nine Palms Band of Mission Indians to take over the Spotlight's management. The tribe and Trump Hotels will raise up to $60 million to turn the betting parlor into more of a resort, which is expected to take on the Trump brand name and a dash of Mr. Trump's trademark extravagance.
The announcement came a day after California voters approved a measure to legalize Las Vegas-style casinos on Indian lands throughout the state, setting off a scramble by tribes to expand existing casinos or open new ones.
Casino companies from Nevada, New Jersey and elsewhere are angling to get in on what could become a huge gambling market. Three Las Vegas companies, Harrah's Entertainment, Anchor Gaming and Station Casinos, have already announced deals to build and manage tribal casinos, each costing roughly $100 million. Lakes Gaming, a Minnesota company that specializes in managing Indian casinos, says it has signed up two tribes. Other deals are expected soon.
Tribal gambling, of course, is already widespread. But the expansion of tribal casinos in California is noteworthy because the large population could allow the state to grow quickly into one of the largest gambling markets, perhaps rivaling New Jersey. Bear, Stearns has estimated that casino revenue in California will grow to $4.7 billion in 2004 from about $1 billion a year now. But Robertson Stephens estimates the California market will reach only $2.6 billion by then. By contrast, Nevada has about $9 billion in casino revenue and New Jersey $4 billion.
It is also noteworthy because California, next door to Nevada, supplies about a third of the visitors to Las Vegas and an even higher percentage to Laughlin, Reno and Lake Tahoe. California could thus pose a bigger threat than other states to Nevada's gambling-based economy.
"It's not a positive for Las Vegas, I can tell you that," said Mr. Trump, whose company runs three casinos in Atlantic City and one in Indiana but none in Las Vegas. One of the most attractive markets, he and others said, is this area around Palm Springs, already a sizable tourist spot. People from Los Angeles can drive here in about two hours, less than half the time needed to get to Las Vegas.
Nevada casinos spent more than $20 million to try to defeat a ballot measure in 1998 to legalize California tribal gambling. The bill was approved overwhelmingly, though it was later overturned in court. So this year the casinos did not oppose the measure, which got 65 percent of the vote, and instead are trying for a slice of the tribal revenues.
Even the master casino builder Stephen A. Wynn has been scouting, although the planned acquisition of his company Mirage Resorts by MGM Grand will take any decision out of his hands. The Cabazon Band of Mission Indians, which runs a casino a few minutes' drive from the Spotlight, has held talks with Mirage and other casino companies, said Brenda Soulliere, first vice chairman, who said no decision had been made yet.
There are already about 40 tribal casinos in California with about 19,000 slot machines. But the state constitution bans Nevada-style gambling, so officials had threatened to shut the casinos down.
Now, casinos will be able to put in full-fledged slot machines, not the so-called video lottery terminals they have now, which do not have arms to pull and print out winnings on a piece of paper. The tribes will also be able to have card games like blackjack in which players play against the house. (Now players pay 50 cents or a dollar a hand into a pool that is used to pay winners.) But craps and roulette will not be allowed.
All this could make gambling more attractive in California. And with the threat of shutdown eliminated, the tribes will find it easier to get financing to expand.
"I'm just so relieved," said Richard M. Milanovich, chairman of the Tribal Council of the Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians, which spent millions of dollars to win approval of Indian-run gambling. The tribe's five-year-old Spa Casino is housed mainly in a huge canvas tent that stands somewhat incongruously in the middle of upscale Palm Springs.
Now the tribe is wasting little time. On Monday, the tribe is expected to announce plans to invest more than $100 million to build a permanent casino with an entertainment center and restaurants, and to replace the adjacent Spa hotel with a larger one. The tribe, one of California's wealthiest, is also expected to announce an investment of $80 million or more to build a second casino. The total number of slot machines is expected to grow to 2,000 from 1,150.
Some tribal officials dispute predictions of an explosion of gambling in California or a huge influx of Nevada companies. Some deals now being announced or proposed will not get financing or prove economically feasible. Some still require tribes to obtain land and could face local opposition. Many reservations in remote locations could not support a casino of any size.
"You're not going to have a lot of significant operations," said Howard L. Dickstein, a Sacramento lawyer who represents several tribes. He said more than half the existing casinos had fewer than 350 slot machines each.
For casino companies as well, the opportunity is somewhat limited. Under federal law, outside companies cannot own tribal casinos and management contracts last no more than seven years, and usually five.
"In a perfect world I would rather own 100 percent," said Glenn C. Christenson, chief financial officer of Station Casinos. Still, he said, such deals can be profitable. Station will get 22.5 percent of the net revenue of the casino it will build with the United Auburn Indian Community near Sacramento, a few miles from the highway that links San Francisco and Reno.
Still, some casino executives say it makes little sense to set up a competitor only to be kicked out after five or seven years. Some tribes, having already run their own casinos, do not need outside help and do not want to split the profits. Some tribes also have lingering resentment against the casinos that tried to defeat the 1998 ballot measure.
For slot machine makers the opportunity is less ambiguous. "It's probably one of the biggest markets that ever opened up all at one time," said Ed Rogich, vice president for marketing at International Game Technology, the largest manufacturer of slot machines.
Under an agreement between tribes and the state, the number of slot machines could more than double, to about 45,000 -- more than New Jersey's 36,000 but far behind Nevada's 200,000. And some analysts say the agreement could be interpreted to allow even more.
Each tribe will be allowed up to 2,000 machines; most big Las Vegas resorts, Mr. Rogich said, have 2,000 to 3,000.
Because of the shaky legal ground of the California casinos, the leading slot machine makers would not sell to them before for fear of losing their own licenses. The machines in use at the tribal casinos here, with names like Native American Gold or Native Nickels, are crude compared with the machines now available elsewhere, which have themes like Wheel of Fortune or Monopoly, and bonus rounds. And without clanging coins, these are no doubt some of the quietest casinos around.
Las Vegas itself is not expected to suffer much because its billion-dollar resorts offer entertainment beyond gambling. The city has continued to grow despite the advent of gambling in numerous other states. Indeed, there is some evidence that gambling elsewhere only whets people's appetite for Las Vegas.
"It's not like Las Vegas is going to be reproduced in Palm Springs," said Ellis Landau, chief financial officer of Boyd Gaming, which runs four hotels in Las Vegas. While there are five casinos in the Palm Springs area, they are spread apart.
But Reno and Laughlin, which have fewer nongambling amenities and are more dependent than Las Vegas on people driving from California, could be hit harder. Harry C. Curtis, an analyst at Robertson Stephens, estimates that casino earnings in those cities could drop 15 to 20 percent in 2001, but recover later.
Harry York, chief executive of the Reno-Sparks Chamber of Commerce, said the expanded California gambling was "definitely something we have to reckon with and deal with, but it's not going to kill us."
He said the city was renovating its downtown and advertising itself as a place for more than just gambling. And while 30 percent of the economy is directly dependent on gambling, that number has dropped as the city has diversified. For example, it has attracted a big Amazon.com distribution center.
But some people gambling here say they already visit Nevada less. "It's better than having to drive to Vegas," said Rita Recio, from near Los Angeles, who was playing a slot machine in the Palm Springs casino. The lack of clanging coins and the makeshift environment did not bother her. "I didn't even notice it was a tent," she said.
Many people interviewed said they supported the casinos, which they said had helped the economy and provided entertainment for the many retirees here. But there was some concern about casinos growing too rapidly or the area becoming too much like Las Vegas.
"I'd hate to see the smallness of it change," said Marjorie Young, who has lived in Palm Springs for 24 years and gambles at the Spa Casino twice a week.
The Palms Springs casino has drawn some local opposition, especially because of its garish electric sign, which some see as clashing with the city's more subdued ambience. But Mr. Milanovich, the tribal chairman, said the new casino would blend in.
As for Mr. Trump, some gamblers were puzzled about what a big developer could want with a little casino like this. "Compared to Mirage and MGM Grand it seems a rather small type of thing," said Joe Preece, a businessman.
Still, some said the money could help. Elaine Pandl, visiting from Wisconsin, said she found the casino a bit "tacky," but when she heard of Mr. Trump's involvement added, "Maybe he'll put in a new carpet."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Deutsche Bank Announces Merger Plans With Rival

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, Mar. 9

 BODY:
Declaring the era of "Germany Inc." had ended, the chief executive of Deutsche Bank A.G. outlined a radical plan today to merge with the bank's main rival and spin off their retail businesses serving 10 million customers.
Though its main elements were already known, Deutsche Bank's planned combination with Dresdner Bank is one of the most far-reaching overhauls for Germany's huge banks since the end of World War II. 
 It would also unravel the labyrinthine cross-holdings that have bound together German banks and insurance companies, a move that could accelerate the pace of corporate change in Europe's biggest economy.
"The headline for this is disentanglement and thus another facet in the farewell from Germany Inc.," said Rolf-Ernst Breuer, Deutsche Bank's chief executive.
The merger could have an impact on Germany's other big private banks -- Commerzbank A.G. in Frankfurt and Hypovereinsbank A.G. in Munich. Both would be far overshadowed by the Deutsche-Dresdner colossus, and German newspapers were already carrying unconfirmed reports that Commerzbank had become a takeover target.
As expected, Deutsche will essentially acquire Dresdner in a stock exchange worth about $30 billion. With $1.2 trillion in assets and operations around the globe, the new Deutsche Bank would be second only to the forthcoming union between three of Japan's biggest banks.
Under a complex deal with the German insurance conglomerate Allianz A.G., which holds stakes in both banks, Deutsche will spin off both banks' retail branch networks in a new entity that will be called Bank 24. Allianz will then reduce its stake in the two banks but acquire 49 percent of Bank 24. Allianz will also acquire Deutsche's big mutual fund business, called DWS, as well as Deutsche's own insurance subsidiary, Deutsche Herold.
All told, Mr. Breuer told reporters and analysts today, the bank merger would make it possible to eliminate 16,000 jobs around the world. About 5,900 jobs would be cut by reducing the number of local branch offices in Germany, while most of the rest would come from combining investment banking businesses.
Industry analysts said the bank merger would have little impact on American banks, in part because Dresdner has little presence in the United States. But the merger goes a long way toward solving Deutsche's biggest problem, which is its huge and costly network of retail branch offices across Germany.
That network barely makes a profit, and analysts believe that Dresdner's local branch operations are running substantial losses. Both banks are suffering the same problem: a huge oversupply of branches and cut-throat price competition from Germany's savings banks.
The biggest surprise is Deutsche Bank's decision to jettison the entire retail business, only keeping enough control to be able to still sell its own financial products through them.
Industry executives have speculated at length on this kind of outcome, and Mr. Breuer himself has hinted strongly in recent weeks that the rise of electronic banking over the Internet makes it far less important now to serve customers through physical branch offices. Nevertheless, many analysts have been skeptical that Deutsche would give up such a big stake, because it means losing control over a distribution channel to millions of customers.
Today's merger is the latest in a wave of bank consolidations across Europe, from the merger of Banque National de Paris and Paribas in France to deals in Spain, Belgium, Italy and Scandinavia. Until today, Germany had been behind most other countries even though the banking market here is extremely overcrowded. Though experts and industry executives have agreed that mergers were the only possible source of relief, the four big private banks have spent years wrestling over who would cede control.
Officially, the deal is a merger of equals, but Deutsche Bank is clearly in charge. Though the exact ratio was not set, Deutsche shareholders will own 60 to 64 percent of the company and Dresdner shareholders will own the rest. The new bank will be called Deutsche Bank but will use Dresdner's green logo. Dresdner's chief executive, Bernhard Walter, will share the top post with Mr. Breuer.
Shares of both banks soared after news of the merger came out on Tuesday. But Dresdner shares fell 11 percent today and Deutsche shares fell almost 13 percent as investors assessed the cost-cutting plans.
Mr. Breuer predicted that the combined bank would be able to save about $2.9 billion a year, though that figure is considerably more optimistic than some investment analysts have calculated.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Led by Technology Issues, Main Gauges Rally Sharply

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
Technology issues paced a strong stock market rally yesterday as the Nasdaq composite index soared through the 5,000 mark for the first time while the broadest market gauge of all, the Wilshire total market index, surged above 14,000, also a record.
After some early losses, prices climbed steadily without benefit of any obvious trigger as investors piling again into computer-related and other technology stocks were joined by those seeking bargains elsewhere. 
 "Tech had a great day and drugs had a great day," said Matthew W. Johnson, chief Nasdaq trader at Lehman Brothers. "There's money that wants to buy."
The Nasdaq market gained 149.60 points, or 3.05 percent, to finish at 5,046.86, surpassing the previous high, set last Friday, of 4,914.79, and solidly above the 5,000 benchmark it had briefly reached on Tuesday.
Other major gauges also surged, with the Dow Jones industrial average pulling out of an early 118-point hole to end with a gain of 154.20, or 1.56 percent, to finish back above the 10,000 mark. At 10,010.73, the blue chip average is now less than twice the Nasdaq composite compared with five times as much in early 1997.
The Standard & Poor's 500 advanced 34.99 points, or 2.56 percent, to end at 1,401.69. Of its components, 340 posted gains while 141 declined and 19 were unchanged. Cisco gained 615/16 , to 1395/16 ; Microsoft 47/16 , to 100; and America Online 6 3/8, to 61 1/4, to lead the way.
"It's the winners chasing the winners," said Ned Riley Jr., chief investment strategist at State Street Global Advisors in Boston. He predicted that investors would continue to favor high-flying technology issues for another three or four months until it became clear that the Federal Reserve was succeeding, as he said it inevitably would, in slowing down a white-hot economy.
Long-term investors, however, might want to start looking elsewhere for bargains, Mr. Riley said.
For a second day, it was the beaten-down drug sector that captured much of this attention. Bristol-Myers Squibb jumped 6, to 53 3/4, and Warner-Lambert 59/16 , to 91 3/8, with Lilly, Merck and American HomeProducts advancing more than four points each. Some analysts said the threat of government intervention to restrict price increases seems to have receded with the winnowing of the presidential field while others said that drug stocks had simply become too cheap to ignore.
"There's a perfect example of a group that was oversold," Mr. Johnson said of drug stocks, several of which have double-digit percentage losses this year. "People began to realize these things are valuable."
Aetna, whose stock reached 99 7/8 last spring and which an institutional holder wants to see auctioned off piecemeal, advanced 2 7/8, to 57.
On the other hand, Lehman Brothers recommended several producers of depressed specialty chemicals, but those stocks showed little response.
And PaineWebber found little enthusiasm despite a spurt in quarterly profits for H. J. Heinz, which traded as high as 54 last May but closed yesterday at 34 1/2, up 1/4. The brokerage firm cut its target price to 36 from 44.
Procter & Gamble, clobbered earlier in the week, was little changed.
The Wilshire 5000 index, which covers nearly every American stock, climbed into positive territory for the year, advancing 338.45 points, or 2.48 percent, to 14,006.37
On the New York Stock Exchange, 1,682 issues gained while 1,299 lost ground, but 52-week lows still far surpassed new highs, this time by 175 to 65. Volume edged down to 1.12 billion shares.
Overseas, major indexes rose about 2 percent in Sao Paulo and London but fell about one-half of 1 percent in Tokyo and Frankfurt. Hong Kong stocks fell 1.75 percent.

Treasury Prices Rise
Bloomberg News
Treasury bond prices increased slightly yesterday as the Treasury Department repurchased $1 billion of debt in the government's first buyback in seven decades.
The Treasury, which plans to buy back as much as $30 billion of debt this year, received $8.6 billion face value in offers of outstanding 30-year bonds.
"With inflation under control, combined with continued Treasury buybacks, you have a recipe" for bonds to outperform shorter-term securities, said Gary Pzegeo, an investment manager for Evergreen Asset Management in Boston.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 3/32 , to 10111/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.15 percent from 6.16 percent on Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Mexico's Chief Justice Strives to Oil a Creaking System

BYLINE: By SAM DILLON

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, March 9

 BODY:
Seated at his desk, Chief Justice Genaro Gongora Pimentel was partly hidden behind an 18-inch stack of judicial papers. With assembly line rhythm, a clerk was pulling writs and rulings from atop the pile, sliding scores of them, one after the other, under the chief justice's hand for his signature.
This clerical drudgery took much of an hour. And it is not uncharacteristic of routines at the Mexican Supreme Court, where the caseload is overwhelming. Last year Justice Gongora and his 10 colleagues issued 6,573 rulings. The United States Supreme Court issued 75. 
 The workload is one sign of the archaic state of the Mexican judiciary, the weak sister in the country's out-of-kilter system of checks and balances. The opposition-led Congress, though still dominated by an overwhelmingly powerful executive branch, is flexing new muscles. But the court system remains feeble.
That is what the chief justice says he is determined to change.
"I want to modernize our federal judiciary," he said during a recent 90-minute interview in his office. He believes that institutions must change for Mexico to compete economically.
Since he began a four-year term as chief justice last year, Justice Gongora has lobbied publicly for measures to reduce the court's workload and to strengthen its role as a referee between the executive and legislative powers. And he has endorsed Mexico's evolution toward democracy more forcefully than any previous chief justice.
"There's no reason to be upset," he told reporters as he left a tumultuous session of Congress last fall in which President Ernesto Zedillo had been heckled and raucous booing had drowned out the speech of an opposition member. "This was a display of pluralism. We Mexicans need to get used to new times."
His public candor has won him many admirers.
"The court was silent before," said Hector Fix Zamudio, a prominent Mexican constitutional scholar. "Justice Gongora has given it an active voice."
Some of his initiatives have drawn criticism, too. The court's appointment of about 50 new federal judges last fall under an expedited process that sidestepped requirements for a competitive examination aroused a furor in legal circles here. Many of the new judges have close professional ties to Supreme Court justices.
"He wants to confront the judiciary's problems, which is praiseworthy," said Jose Ramon Cossio Diaz, the law dean at Mexico City's Autonomous Technological Institute, whom Justice Gongora invited to serve on a judicial reform commission. "But the way he's gone about trying to strengthen the court is dangerous and could bring the judiciary into general discredit."
The Mexican judiciary has never enjoyed the prestige of the executive branch. A prominent lawyer returned from studies at Harvard University in 1972 convinced of the need to strengthen the Supreme Court, and urged a leader of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party to seek appointment as its chief justice.
"I wanted him to be Mexico's John Marshall," the lawyer said, referring to 19th-century America's pioneering chief justice. The party leader just laughed. "He said I didn't know how things worked, that to be on the Supreme Court was just to be in limbo," the lawyer recalled.
Three presidents in this century have simply dismissed Mexico's entire Supreme Court. One was Mr. Zedillo, who in his first month in office removed all 26 justices, installing a new 11-member court.
Justice Gongora, who is 62, was one of Mr. Zedillo's new appointments. He previously served as a judge, appellate magistrate and law professor. His colleagues voted him chief justice in January 1999.
Six weeks later, Justice Gongora urged constitutional amendments to increase the Supreme Court's power. Approved last June, they relieved the court of the obligation to rule on hundreds of arcane jurisdictional disputes that had clogged its agenda.
But its caseload remains extraordinary, and in response Justice Gongora has invited judges, lawyers and law professors to draft a simpler law governing the fundamental procedure by which Mexicans appeal sentences, file habeas corpus petitions, seek injunctions and contest the constitutionality of laws.
A curious feature of the system is that Supreme Court rulings declaring laws unconstitutional apply only to the victorious plaintiff. All other Mexicans must continue to obey the flawed law or file their own challenges. That can force the court to review the same law over and over.
Mexico's Supreme Court has issued several recent rulings that scholars say have moved it somewhat from the president's shadow.
But legal scholars could recall no ruling that had circumscribed presidential power significantly. "They wouldn't dare," said Elisur Arteaga Nava, the author of a standard text on Mexican constitutional law. "Our presidents are still far too powerful."

HEADLINE: Residential Real Estate;
Luxury Housing by the Boardwalk

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE

 BODY:
A condominium community that will eventually have 850 apartments in 16 midrise buildings is beginning to take root on 15 acres at the edge of the Atlantic Ocean in Brighton Beach.
The first two structures at the $325 million gated community, called Oceana, are under construction, and 81 of their 104 two- to four-bedroom apartments have been sold since October. This week the sales campaign expanded to 100 more units in two more buildings rising directly alongside the Boardwalk at the Brooklyn site. Once home to the Brighton Beach Baths, the site is bounded by Brighton Beach Avenue and the Boardwalk and Coney Island Avenue and Seacoast Terrace. 
 The units in the initial buildings range in size from 871 to 1,973 square feet and sold for $267,990 to $750,000, though a few units are still available in the $250,000 range. Prices for the oceanside apartments, which will be similar in size, will be 10 to 50 percent higher, with the penthouses costing more than $1.2 million, said Diana W. Jabber. She is a senior vice president at the Muss Development Company of Forest Hills, Queens, which is developing the project with the Carlyle Group of Washington, D.C.
Two acres at the core of the site are to be reserved for recreational use, including a one-acre park, a health club and indoor and outdoor pools. A 1,200-car parking garage also is planned.
Oceana is among the largest luxury housing projects to be developed in Brooklyn in decades. It will replace the collection of pools and lounges that made up the old bath complex, which, hurt by declining membership, closed in 1997 after more than 90 years.
"We're adding a community that is an alternative to the suburbs and that until now has been unavailable," said Joshua L. Muss, president of Muss Development. He acquired the site last year from his cousin, Stephen Muss, who tried unsuccessfully from 1986 through the early 1990's to develop 1,500 condos in four towers as high as 32 stories. Then the recession hit and the project never proceeded.
Joshua Muss said he and his partner modified the project to have fewer but larger units, because "it would be difficult to finance buildings as large as the ones proposed, and the market today is for spacious apartments." The buildings were restricted to heights of 5 to 12 stories to meet waterfront zoning regulations put in place in 1993. Mr. Muss said that while he is committed to building condominiums for the first four buildings, he has the flexibility to include housing for the elderly or rentals in the later phases.
Real estate brokers said the pace of sales at Oceana reflected the continuing strength of New York City's residential market, where demand still outstrips supply. "We are at a point of having buyers, but no inventory to sell," said Jeffrey J. Ferretti, who is the president of National Brokerage in Mill Basin, as well as of the Brooklyn Board of Realtors.
In neighborhoods in the central and south shore areas of Brooklyn, which includes Brighton Beach, prices over the last year for all housing types increased 10 to 20 percent on average, Mr. Ferretti said. His office put the average sales price for condominiums in and around Brighton Beach at about $250,000.
Buyers, he continued, include second-generation members of immigrant families, primarily from Russia, who want to invest in real estate, as well as empty nesters who want to sell their large houses and "reinvest in a home in the area with less upkeep." But, he said, the production of new luxury units in the area is limited.
Christopher D. Thomas, a senior vice president at the Brooklyn office of William B. May, a Manhattan-based brokerage, added that new developments that offer "services and a waterfront location can command a premium above the market." They can also attract buyers from outside the area, from Manhattan, for example, who are willing "to compromise a longer commute for amenities," he said. He added that "the farther out the development is the developer has to offer a better value."
Those are the buyers Muss Development has drawn or expects to draw. "We have the advantage of offering people the opportunity to stay in or move back to the area," Mr. Muss said. "With the housing market hot there is always a spillover from Manhattan."
Ms. Jabber added that the apartments, with nine-foot-high ceilings, cost "30 to 40 percent less than comparable size units on Manhattan's East Side."
Alex and Diana Klurfeld, who have two daughters, are trading their two-bedroom rental in a nearby Brooklyn neighborhood for a three-bedroom, fifth-floor unit with an ocean view they are buying for $426,000 at Oceana.
"We wanted to stay close to our parents yet be even closer to the ocean," said Mr. Klurfeld, a physical therapist in Williamsburg. "We think we are getting good value for the money and living there will be something like being on vacation all year round."
In addition to the planned recreational complex, other amenities at Oceana, designed in a classic style with gabled roofs and balconies, include 24-hour security and high-speed Internet connections. Monthly maintenance charges will range from $211 to $968 for the apartments and higher for the penthouses.
The development has also received a 15-year tax abatement, with taxes fully abated for the first 10 years and rising 20 percent a year for the next five years. With the abatement, monthly taxes on the apartments will range from $9 to $41; without the abatement they would be $207 to $946.
Occupancy of the initial four buildings is slated for this fall and winter. Mr. Muss said the entire project, depending on the pace of sales, could take three years to complete.

HEADLINE: House Panel Approves Aid to Bolster a Faltering Colombia

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH BECKER

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
By a wide margin, the House Appropriations Committee approved an emergency aid package tonight of $1.7 billion to shore up Colombia's tottering democracy and enable its military to step up its war against narcotics traffickers.
The vote was 33 to 13, with opponents noting the abysmal human rights record of the Colombian Army, which will receive much of the money and equipment. 
 The House package, which was crafted by the Republican leadership and was an increase over the original request from President Clinton, included more money to help with human rights and judicial reform in Colombia and to help neighboring countries fight the narcotics trade.
"If we move the druggies out of Colombia we don't want them to land in another country in the region," said Representative C. W. Bill Young, Republican of Florida, chairman of the committee.
The president had asked for $1.2 billion for his two-year plan to support Colombia's tottering democracy and bolster its military efforts to fight the drug trade by reducing the booming production of cocaine and heroin in Colombia. The House panel today added $500 million to the program's budget.
Colombia is the source of 90 percent of the cocaine consumed in the United States.
But the country is embroiled in a three-sided civil war including rebels and paramilitary groups that are lavishly supported by the drug trade.
Democrats objected to what they said was the hastiness of today's action, arguing that the administration may believe it is only fighting a war against drugs in Colombia but could find itself unwittingly pulled into the civil war.
Calling on lessons learned from Vietnam, Representative David R. Obey, Democrat of Wisconsin, said that while he didn't think the administration had any plans to send American troops to fight in Colombia, he worried that there "could be a confluence of events that could lead to that."
Mr. Obey failed to persuade the committee to withhold temporarily the $500 million of military aid earmarked for training and equipping two army counternarcotics battalions. He said Congress needed to know more about their mission to gain control over two cocaine-producing provinces in southern Colombia before approving the money.
The House package also includes money for 30 Blackhawk and 30 Huey helicopters for the Colombian Army and police forces and $115.5 million for the national police.
The entire $9 billion emergency spending bill -- which also includes aid for the Kosovo and East Timor peacekeeping missions, natural disaster assistance, and money to pay the Pentagon's rising fuel bill -- will go to the floor of the House within two weeks, according to committee aides.
Central to today's debate was the sense that Colombia's president, Andres Pastrana, may be running out of time to implement his "Plan Colombia" to strengthen democracy, a program that is also seeking money from Europe and international financial institutions.
Both Republicans and Democrats praised Mr. Pastrana today for placing human rights as a priority and for trying to negotiate peace with the guerrillas, even though he has failed to reach a cease-fire.
"He is in the middle, he is trying to lead Colombia into the modern world," said Representative James P. Moran, Republican of Virginia. "If we don't help him now it may be too late later."
But several Democratic opponents of the bills argued that it would be better to provide economic and humanitarian aid, and the Senate is likely to raise even greater concerns about human rights in Colombia when it considers the bill.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Drew Donations From 49 States Last Year

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's Senate campaign received contributions last year from donors in every state except North Dakota, attracting an even broader geographic spectrum of financial support than his rival, Hillary Rodham Clinton, according to a report yesterday by a nonpartisan research group.
But the report, by the Center for Responsive Politics, criticized the Giuliani campaign sharply for failing to provide full disclosure of its largest donors, saying that 21 percent of those contributing $200 or more had not specified their occupations or employers in filings with the Federal Election Commission. 
 "Without that data, it is impossible to identify the donors' economic interests," said the report, which followed a separate report in late February by the same group on Mrs. Clinton's contributors. It found that the Clinton campaign had identified the occupations and employers of more than 90 percent of its donors who gave $200 or more.
The criticism provoked a sharp exchange between campaign advisers, with Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, Howard Wolfson, charging in a news release that the Giuliani camp was "evading campaign laws by refusing to tell the people of New York what his donors do for a living."
Although federal election guidelines require candidates to seek and disclose information on their donors' employment, there is a gray area in that donors are under no obligation to disclose what they do or where they work.
"Mrs. Clinton's press secretary either doesn't know what he is talking about or doesn't care," said John H. Gross, the Giuliani campaign treasurer. He said the mayor's campaign staff had "fully complied" with federal rules by asking for employment information in its direct mailings to potential donors and in follow-up letters to people who sent contributions.
The report found that Mayor Giuliani's campaign raised $11.8 million last year from donors in 49 states, compared with Mrs. Clinton's campaign contributions of $8.1 million from donors in 46 states.
It said that the largest source of financial support for the mayor came from people in the financial industry, based in Manhattan.
The earlier report on the Clinton campaign found its biggest source of support was among lawyers and people in the entertainment industry.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
Life at the Corner of Journalism and Activism

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN

 BODY:
THERE was a time, back in the fiscally straitened 1970's, that the city was so desperate it turned to known members of the media for help. Thus did Osborn Elliott, departing editor of Newsweek, become a deputy mayor, largely on the strength of his side job as chairman of the Citizens Committee for New York City, which had recruited several thousand volunteers to fill city jobs left vacant by layoffs.
Mr. Elliott's tenure as deputy mayor for economic development lasted 14 months -- "I was among the rascals thrown out by the rascals who came in with Ed Koch" -- even though he only charged $1 a year for his services and the city stopped hemorrhaging jobs on his watch. 
 But the Citizens Committee has flourished, through Mr. Elliott's sometimes stormy eight-year tenure as dean of Columbia University's journalism school, through his hatching and leading a nationwide march on Washington in 1992 to demand more federal money for cities and various other episodes in a career spent exploring the boundary of journalism and activism.
The Citizens Committee, which has morphed into a teach-a-man-to-fish organization that has trained tens of thousands of people to be neighborhood activists and gives hundreds of grants a year to neighborhood groups, turned 25 a few weeks ago, not long after Mr. Elliott himself turned 75.
It was in the committee's offices in a former fur-industry stronghold on Seventh Avenue that Chairman Elliott was spotted this week, polka dot bowtie in place, old-money-New-York voice huskier and quieter after a successful battle with cancer of the larynx -- "They removed half of my voice box and there are those who say that was a 50 percent improvement right there" -- still arguing the merits of a more civic-minded press, government and citizenry.
Not only does the now-largely-solvent city need its volunteers more than ever, Mr. Elliott said -- to ease the transition from welfare to work, to help new immigrants navigate the winding corridors of city bureaucracy -- but much of the recent turnaround can be traced to them.
This is why a career big-picture guy, a big shot long past the traditional retirement age, continues to spend four days a week guiding an organization that counts among its proudest accomplishments of 1999 a $1,000 grant to the Garden of Happiness City Farms project in the Bronx, an $800 gift to a job-mentoring program in Queens and a $2,000 check to GLOBE -- Gays and Lesbians of Bushwick Empowered.
"When we started," he said, "there were about 3,000 block and neighborhood associations in the city. Now there are 12,000 groups, they're all on our mailing list, and we figure they enlist an army of about a million volunteers who are working in their neighborhoods, cleaning up the parks, indulging in community policing, running after-school programs for kids, taking care of the homeless and the homebound. It's almost like an underground movement that people don't really see."
Mr. Elliott, who with his high forehead and straight-line mouth closely resembles the portrait of Osborn-Elliott-as-George-Washington that hangs on his wall (not far from a subpoena he received in a libel suit from the vice president for the Newsweek article "The Scandals of '73: Enter Agnew"), does not seem the most natural of advocates for the newly arrived and the downtrodden.
A descendant of Steven Coerte van Voorhees, who came to New Amsterdam from Holland in the early 17th century, he grew up in the East 60's, the son of a Wall Street father and a mother who got her real estate license after Daddy lost a bundle in the Depression and became a powerhouse of the brownstone world. After the Navy and Harvard, he went to work at The Journal of Commerce, where he was, among other things, the nonferrous-metals reporter.
Mr. Elliott's resume as a neighborhood activist is, in fact, a bit spotty. "I don't think there even is a block association at 72nd and Madison," he said. After maintaining at least a pied-a-terre on the East Side for his entire life, Mr. Elliott, along with his wife, Inger McCabe Elliott, is preparing to move to Central Park West, or, as he refers to it, "Pittsburgh," but don't expect him to plant any trees.
"I think there are plenty of trees in Central Park," he said.
BUT at Newsweek, which he ran from 1961 to 1976, he kept a focus on the nation's underside, and he counts as the most interesting week of his life a 1970 field trip with other white journalists into the heart of America's black ghettos. "It was a tremendous eye opener," he said. "I got to know some people pretty well even though we were only spending a night or two in each place. It kind of changed my life in a way."
Nothing in Mr. Elliott's post-Newsweek life has matched the thrill of journalism, he said, but years of struggling to awaken the news media to the magic wrought by volunteers have soured him somewhat on his former colleagues.
"I've come to view journalism with a little bit less adoration than I used to have," he said. "I think it should be much more engaged, engage its readers more, engage them more in their community life." In big cities like New York, he said, newspapers, particularly this one, have an attitude that says: "We're journalists. We don't get involved."
All right, Mr. Elliott, if you were editor of this newspaper, what kinds of stories would you do?
"I'd say we want a real puff job on Elliott tomorrow."

HEADLINE: Mayor Says School Board's Base Is for Sale, Study or No

BYLINE: By ELISABETH BUMILLER

 BODY:
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced yesterday that the city was aggressively seeking a buyer for 110 Livingston Street, the Board of Education's decrepit and maligned headquarters in downtown Brooklyn, and that he was not going to wait for the board's study exploring the possibility of a sale.
"Study!" Mr. Giuliani said derisively at a news briefing. "That's what the city used to be doing. It used to study itself to death." He added that although the board must approve the sale of the city-owned building, "we're going to push this process to the limit" and that the city "can put together a whole deal" for the board. Asked if he could go forward at this point without board approval, Mr. Giuliani said, "Damn right we can." 
 Board officials responded that the mayor was trying to pick a fight and get attention. One board member said that Mr. Giuliani was resentful that control of the city's education agenda had shifted to Harold O. Levy, the interim chancellor whose appointment the mayor opposed.
"We set up a process to take a look at the sale of the buildings, and we're going to stay with that process," said William C. Thompson Jr., the board president.
Mr. Levy, who telephoned the mayor shortly after his appointment in January but has yet to have his call returned, had little comment yesterday in the latest chapter of the continuous conflict between Mr. Giuliani and a board that the mayor regularly says should be abolished.
"I have been directed by the Board of Education to conduct a strategic review of both the board's facilities and its staffing, with a deadline of June 2000," Mr. Levy said in a two-sentence statement issued by his office. "Until that review is completed, it would be premature to comment on any efforts to sell the current board headquarters building."
Privately, board members said they were not going to let the situation escalate by biting at what they described as Mr. Giuliani's bait.
The mayor made his announcement at an elaborate City Hall news conference, complete with pictures and charts showing the three buildings that make up the board's headquarters in downtown Brooklyn: 110 Livingston Street, 131 Livingston Street and 65 Court Street. The three buildings are close to each other but not contiguous, and Mr. Giuliani gave no figures as to their worth.
The best known of the buildings is 110 Livingston Street, where Mr. Levy and the board members have offices. It is a former Elks lodge designed in the late 1920's by the legendary firm of McKim, Mead & White -- after the three famous architects who gave the firm its name were dead. The American Institute of Architects Guide to New York City describes the building as "pallid and boring."
Mr. Giuliani took on the tone of a real estate agent with an excellent deal to offer yesterday. "This is an area of the city that has gone through an amazing transformation over the last four or five years," the mayor said enthusiastically of downtown Brooklyn, adding that the city would extend tax breaks to buyers.
"So these are pieces of real estate that should have a great deal of interest," the mayor concluded.
Officially, the action of the mayor was an announcement that the city has issued a Request for Expressions of Interest, the first step in attracting bids from developers for the buildings. Michael G. Carey, president of the city's Economic Development Corporation, said he hoped to have the buildings sold by the end of the year.
After the news conference, Mr. Carey said that it was possible that a buyer would acquire the property while Board of Education employees were still working in the buildings and that it would be up to the new landlord to decide how to proceed.
Mr. Giuliani first announced that he wanted to sell 110 Livingston Street during his State of the City speech in January, which people took as a joke. Yesterday Mr. Giuliani's critics said that the sale was a gimmick and not a solution. "The change of address is not enough," said Peter F. Vallone, the speaker of the City Council.
Hillary Rodham Clinton, Mr. Giuliani's opponent for United States Senate, responded with a three-page news release outlining what she described as the mayor's failures on education.

HEADLINE: Boat People Losing (Uneasy) Haven

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: HONG KONG, March 6

 BODY:
Ask Nguyen Kim Lien about life inside the barbed-wire fence of the Pillar Point Vietnamese Refugee Camp here and she is remarkably stoic. Her family lives in squalor -- a couple of rooms in a dilapidated housing block, where rats prowl brazenly outside the door. Her husband, who is out of work and addicted to heroin, spends his days wandering the camp in a haze.
Yet Mrs. Lien, 36, has found dignity amid the debris. She runs a shop that sells Vietnamese noodles to the camp's 1,070 refugees. Her two children, who were born in Hong Kong and have never lived outside the camp, go to a nearby school, where they are learning to read and write Chinese. 
 If Mrs. Lien has a reason to despair, it is because in two months she and her family must leave Pillar Point and find a way to support themselves elsewhere in Hong Kong. Last month, this former British colony announced it was shutting down its only remaining refugee camp, ending a drama that began in May 1975, a month after the fall of Saigon, when the first boat laden with refugees came ashore here.
"I'm scared," said Mrs. Lien, who fled Vietnam in 1988 and has been in Pillar Point since 1991. "Inside the camp, I can support myself. But outside, I don't know. I'm scared that I won't get used to it."
People like Nguyen Kim Lien are the ebb tide of a vast diaspora. Of the more than 800,000 Vietnamese who passed through camps in Southeast Asian countries between 1975 and the late-1980's, about 224,000 came to Hong Kong. Most of these went on to settle in the United States, Canada and other countries. At its peak in 1979, there were 68,695 refugees crowded into camps throughout the colony.
Hong Kong says it treated the boat people better than other Asian countries, welcoming them sooner and taking care of them longer. But it granted residency to only a few ethnic Chinese refugees and by the mid-1990's it had put 94,700 people on planes back to Vietnam -- often dragging them up the ramp.
The 1,400 boat people left in Hong Kong have fallen through all the cracks. After more than a decade of filing applications, they cannot gain asylum anywhere else. And they either cannot or will not return to Vietnam.
At a time when Hong Kong has closed its doors to immigrants from mainland China, it is no longer willing to take care of these holdouts. In February, it agreed to consider them for legal status here, but also imposed a deadline: move into society by May 31. They can choose to remain refugees, but Hong Kong will no longer try to find them homes overseas. It will also stop paying for their housing.
"It's time for us to close this chapter of history," said Regina Ip, Hong Kong's secretary of security, who handles immigration policy. "It's been a problem for Hong Kong for a quarter of a century."
Although Hong Kong's ultimatum sounds abrupt, few people fault the government for imposing it. Even critics say the continued existence of Pillar Point has become an intractable hurdle to the efforts of the Vietnamese to get on with their lives. A grim, isolated compound in Hong Kong's New Territories, it is a breeding ground for drug abuse, petty crime and sporadic violence.
Unlike in the 1980's, when the camps were virtual prisons, Pillar Point is open, and residents are encouraged to find jobs outside. But the housing blocks were meant to be temporary structures, and they now look like abandoned army barracks. Even after more than a decade, life for the refugees still feels tenuous.
Last June, the police broke up a riot between Vietnamese and ethnic Chinese refugees, also from Vietnam, who live uneasily next to each other. Sixteen people were injured in the melee. A chain-link fence topped with barbed wire now slices through the camp to separate the two groups.
"The condition of the camp is appalling," said Pam Baker, a British lawyer who has represented boat people in cases against the government. "It really is a purpose-built den of iniquity."
Although the government has prodded the refugees to move into their own apartments, it refused until last month to grant them legal status, and the accompanying identification cards. That made it hard for them to find decent work. With rents in Hong Kong among the highest in Asia, the lure of free housing pulled many back into the camp. Along with residency, the refugees would get ID cards.
"This is a logical conclusion, but it's not a complete conclusion," Ms. Baker said. "What's going to happen to those people who are not accepted for residency? What's going to happen to those who are not allowed to apply?"
More than 130 people would seem to fall into one of those categories. Most have been classified as illegal immigrants or economic migrants rather than refugees. The Vietnamese government has refused to take many back because they have criminal records or health problems. Hong Kong insists it will continue trying to repatriate them, though it is vague about what it will do if that fails.
For those who gain residency, the biggest challenge may be shedding the attitudes developed in years of camp life. Diep Long Anh, 42, an ethnic Chinese who fled Ho Chi Minh City in 1990, said she thought about moving out several times. But the free housing allows her to stay home with her son while her husband works on a construction site. "It's not that we don't want to work," Mrs. Anh said. "We're not lazy. It's just that we worry about getting jobs. It's so expensive to live outside."
Other refugees still dream of moving to California or Canada. This despite the fact that Hong Kong resettled only 71 people in 1999 and a single person so far this year. The office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which had helped process applications, is so beset with refugee problems in Africa and the Balkans that it no longer finances its program here.
Despite Hong Kong's financial outlays, the sense of futility among many refugees has mutated into bitterness toward their adopted home. Some blame their predicament on Hong Kong's return to China in 1997.
"We came here because we wanted freedom, but now Hong Kong is a Communist country," said Nguyen Van Thang, a wiry man with hollow eyes who looks older than his 28 years. Mr. Thang said he still hoped to move to Britain.
Not all the refugees regard their future with dread. Pham Thi Binh, 38, who arrived in Hong Kong in 1988, has bounced in and out of Pillar Point a few times as she and her husband have tried to make it outside. They both work on a construction site.
Mrs. Binh is determined to succeed. "After all these years in Hong Kong, we know we just have to work hard," she said. "If I save enough, I'll go back and invest in Vietnam," she added, with a smile so broad that it briefly lifted the camp's gloom.

HEADLINE: A Leap in the Dropout Rate Confounds School Officials

BYLINE: By ANEMONA HARTOCOLLIS

 BODY:
New York City school officials were struggling yesterday to explain a mysterious and worrisome 2-percentage-point increase in the high school dropout rate, after seven years of declines.
Some principals said students might be dropping out because they were intimidated by the approach of tough new state standards. Some guidance counselors at special schools for failing students said conventional high schools were encouraging their weakest students to leave so that the schools would not appear to be doing a bad job preparing students for the tougher state tests. 
 And some school officials, noting that a large proportion of the dropouts are foreign-born, speculated that an increasing number of immigrants were coming from countries with shabby educational systems and then dropping out.
But in its own report, released on Tuesday along with the annual school report cards, the Board of Education hinted at the most intriguing explanation of all: a crackdown on the longstanding practice of allowing phantom students to appear on high school attendance registers.
Two high-level Board of Education administrators, who spoke on the condition that they not be named, said they believed the dropout rate had been underreported for years, because many schools, hoping to increase state aid, continued to carry students on their rosters long after they had left school with no intention of returning.
The school board refused to comment on the results.
The dropout rate rose to 17.5 percent for the class of 1999 -- the class that was scheduled to graduate last June. That compares with 15.6 percent for the class of 1998. The disparity means about 1,200 more students from the class of 1999 dropped out than from the class of 1998.
The latest figures show the first rise in the dropout rate since 1991, when the rate stood at 20.5 percent.
But there was a paradox to the figures for the class of 1999, one giving credence to the notion that many students were never really there. While more students were dropping out, more were also graduating. The four-year graduation rate for the class of 1999 went up, to 50.1 percent, from 49.7 percent, the first time since 1994 that it had been above 50 percent. At the same time, fewer students stayed in school beyond four years, for as many as seven years. The number of students who attended a fifth year declined by 2.3 points, to 32.4 percent of the class of 1999, compared with 34.7 percent of the class of 1998.
Whatever the reason for the sudden reversal of dropouts, education advocates said yesterday that it was a wake-up call to a system that for many years has been too quick to interpret marginal gains as signs of progress.
"It's a pretty negative report," said Raymond J. Domanico, education adviser for the Metro Industrial Areas Foundation, a coalition of civic and church groups. "We have been told the last few years that things are improving. This is another piece of evidence that says that was not true. With the system under pressure by the standards to improve, there seems to be some indication that the improvement efforts are not taking root."
Much of the speculation yesterday focused on attendance. In part, the two high-level administrators said, the attendance records were sometimes inadvertently inflated, resulting from a lackadaisical approach to tracking truant and missing students. But sometimes the figures were deliberately overstated, they said, to increase state aid, which is partly based on attendance.
In January 1999, Gov. George E. Pataki formed a Moreland Act commission to investigate reports of phantom students at Brandeis and Martin Luther King Jr. High Schools in Manhattan, among other places. The commission's report, released in December, alleged "widespread, systemic abuse" in attendance-keeping but was attacked as flimsy by school officials because it did not specify any schools where such abuse had occurred.
Michael Marr, a spokesman for the commission, said the new dropout numbers confirmed the commission's findings. "Based on what we found here at the Moreland commission with regard to dropout numbers, the prior year's numbers are quite suspect," Mr. Marr said yesterday. "Sunshine is the best disinfectant, and we can only hope that the Board of Education has started to clean up its act."
The two officials said yesterday that the school system itself began cracking down on overstated attendance in the fall of 1997, long before Governor Pataki's commission was formed. That is why, one official said, Brandeis and Martin Luther King dropout rates remained stable from 1998 to 1999, because they were among the first schools that the Board of Education cracked down on.
Tony Hoffmann, assistant principal at Middle College High School in Queens, where the dropout rate declined, said he believed that the specter of tough new Regents graduation tests had scared many students and schools. Some students, he suggested, might have mistakenly believed that the new standards applied to them, and dropped out. In fact, the new tests took effect for the class of 2000 and were not required of the class of 1999.
Asked whether a hot economy might have prompted students to drop out to enter the work force, school officials were doubtful. Bridget N. O'Connor, associate professor of business education at New York University, said only the worst paying and lowest status jobs -- like working in a fast-food restaurant -- were available to students without high school diplomas.
"I sure wouldn't leave for one of those kinds of jobs," she said.
The overall 2-point increase disguised much more striking jumps in dropout rates at some schools. They included several small alternative Manhattan schools: the Coalition School for Social Change, to 17 percent from 2 percent, and Landmark High School, to 7.3 percent from 1.7 percent. In the Bronx, big jumps came at Sarah J. Hale, to 24.5 percent from 12.7 percent; Adlai Stevenson, to 31.8 percent from 26.6 percent; and Evander Childs, to 23.4 percent from 17.9 percent. In Brooklyn, the worst were Bushwick, to 30.1 percent from 19.6 percent, and John Dewey, to 14.5 percent from 9.6 percent. In Manhattan, Art and Design rose to 5.1 percent from 0.7 percent, and in Queens, Hillcrest rose to 16.1 percent from 9.6 percent.

HEADLINE: Vibrant Area of Newark Suffers With Success

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS

DATELINE: NEWARK, March 9

 BODY:
Soaring home prices. Sclerotic traffic. The maddening roar of new construction. Too many people, not enough room.
Ah, the woes of a booming economy. 
 But in an unlikely tale for flush times, the locale in question is not Manhattan or Westchester County, but a corner of Newark, a city left for dead after the 1967 riots, where almost a third of the residents still live in poverty. The Ironbound section, long a bastion of Portuguese immigrants and more recently a magnet for Brazilians and other Latin Americans, has become one of the hottest swaths of real estate in the region.
More than 900 homes have been built here in the last three years, real estate values have risen 30 to 40 percent and most houses are snapped up after just days on the market. "It's been out of this world," said Jack DaSilva, a local developer who recently sold 150 homes in the Ironbound before even a single foundation had been poured.
Now, many residents complain, this bustling neighborhood of about 45,000 people has become too popular for its own good. The cost of housing is forcing families to double and triple up, the rising population has made parking nightmarish and local schools are overwhelmed by the influx of students, many of them Latin American immigrants who speak little English.
"Our quality of life has gone down the tubes," said Mary Correia, 39, the daughter of Portuguese parents who works in the neighborhood but recently moved to the suburbs. "This is no place to raise a family."
Overdevelopment is also feeding tensions between the Portuguese, whom many credit with saving the neighborhood during Newark's darkest days, and the newly arrived Brazilians, who often get blamed for the crowded streets and steep housing prices.
The Rev. Moacir Weirich, a Lutheran minister who runs a storefront church here, said the problems associated with explosive growth had revived long-buried animosities between the faded imperial power and its former colony. "People are angry and they're just looking for someone to blame," said Mr. Weirich, who is Brazilian. "They make easy targets for each another."
A hodgepodge of vinyl-sided homes and 19th-century factories, the Ironbound has always been a gritty, working-class place, named for the railroad tracks that once surrounded it. Even after the riots, when Newark suffered decades of depopulation and disinvestment and a crippling loss of faith, the Ironbound, bolstered by Portuguese immigration, remained a pocket of stability.
Outsiders might find it hard to appreciate the lure of the Ironbound, a densely packed neighborhood where new $300,000 homes -- most without yards -- are raked by the whoosh of planes landing at nearby Newark International Airport.
There are few parks or playgrounds here, and highways, railroad tracks and derelict warehouses are among the area's more prominent features. A layer of concrete separates many of the new homes from toxic soil, a legacy of the area's industrial past.
Augusto Amador, the Ironbound's representative on the Newark City Council, said people were drawn here by easy access to jobs, proximity to the state's main roads and good public transportation. It also helps that immigrants can navigate daily life without worrying about their limited English, he said.
"If you're a hard-working immigrant and you want to settle down in a safe, secure neighborhood, there's no better place to be," said Mr. Amador, who came here from Portugal as a 17-year-old in 1966. "You don't find this kind of stability elsewhere in Newark."
That stability has been fostered by the neighborhood's physical separation from the rest of the city and by the Portuguese, who began arriving in the late 1960's, replacing the Italians, Poles and Irish who came before them.
Although downtown Newark has benefited from a new performing arts center, a minor league baseball stadium and the promise of a professional sports complex, New Jersey's largest city remains mired in poverty.
With its modest two- and three-family houses, many of them built on the sites of former factories, the Ironbound is house-proud but not fussy. Charles Cummings, Newark's official historian, calls it "our Greenwich Village, without the bohemians."
Its vibrant street life is striking as one passes beneath the elevated tracks separating the neighborhood from the downtown and its fenced-in parking lots, vacant office buildings and empty sidewalks. By contrast, the Ironbound's main commercial artery, Ferry Street, is lined with restaurants and bakeries, its sidewalks thick with pedestrians. "I defy you to find an empty storefront on Ferry Street," Mr. Cummings said.
On weekends, thousands of Brazilians, Portuguese and other visitors from the metropolitan area flock to Ferry Street, snarling traffic and double parking on side streets. On most afternoons, the desperate honking of blocked-in drivers fills the air.
For business owners like Jose Moreira, the throngs are good news. "On weekends you can't even walk around in here," Mr. Moreira said on a recent Sunday as he held court at his restaurant, Casa Nova. Brazilian families gathered at tables loaded with barbecued meats, known as churrasco, and men sat along the counter trading gossip and sipping coffee or Brazilian beer.
Mr. Moreira, 33, who arrived here in 1988 and spent years as a landscaper, has done well in the Ironbound. Last year he opened his third restaurant in the neighborhood and he is planning a fourth. "As long as the Brazilians keep coming, I'm going to do good," he said.
Back in his home state of Minas Gerais, Newark is something of a household name, known as a place that promises steady employment to those unintimidated by hard work. The men find jobs as construction workers, landscapers or bakers; the women are usually hired as baby sitters or housekeepers.
They come already knowing the name of Mr. Moreira. Almost daily, newly arrived Brazilians, dragging their luggage behind them, walk into Casa Nova seeking advice, apartments and the comfort of compatriots. Last week it was Elio Lana, 34, a truck driver from Ipatinga who came directly from Newark airport with questions about work. Asked why he came to Newark and not New York City, the celebrated landing pad for immigrants, he smiled. "Everyone knows Newark is much easier than New York," he said.
There are no figures on how many Brazilians live in the Ironbound, but real estate agents estimate that 60 percent of the homes on the market are bought by Brazilians; the remaining buyers are Portuguese, Ecuadorans, Peruvians and Mexicans.
Like many entrepreneurs, Kenneth Rocco has met the influx by hiring more Brazilians at his travel agency, Monica Travel, which also wires money and offers long-distance telephone services. Five of his six employees, he said, are from Brazil. "Brazilians are our future," he said.
Not that the Portuguese are becoming extinct. They remain the neighborhood's most prominent business leaders and are behind nearly all of the new construction. Jacinto Rodrigues, for example, one of the city's largest builders, is also an owner of Crown Bank, a local lending institution that provides many Ironbound homebuyers with mortgages. Some of the biggest employers in Newark are the Ironbound's Portuguese bakeries and restaurants.
But one thing is indisputable: as Brazilians continue to flow into the area, immigration from Portugal has all but dried up. At the same time, many Portuguese families are moving to the suburbs and a growing number of the elderly are retiring to homes they built in Portugal.
The shifting demographics have fostered discord between the two groups, although most everyone agrees that the conflict finds its worst expression in off-color jokes. "We basically make the same silly cracks about each other," said Alessandra Braganca, 27, a travel agent who moved to Newark from Rio de Janeiro six years ago. "They think we're stupid, we think they're snobs."
Some real estate brokers worry that many of those buying new homes are in over their heads. Much of the buying frenzy, they said, has been fueled by subsidized loan programs or mortgages that allow buyers to put down as little as 3 percent.
And because many of them work in construction, an industry notoriously susceptible to economic vagaries, a recession could hit the Ironbound especially hard. "If there's a downturn, there are going to be a lot of people defaulting on their mortgages," said Carlos Couto, the owner of Re/Max United, a real estate brokerage on Ferry Street.
The Ironbound's popularity is also evident in neighborhood schools, which have become the most crowded in the state, with many classes exceeding 40 students. Last month, hundreds of angry parents packed a series of town meetings and demanded that the city provide relief.
Officials said they would try to install trailers in the months ahead and build three schools within the decade, but some parents said they could not wait. "You can't have a community without good schools," said Nancy Zak, a longtime resident and a leader of the Ironbound Community Corporation, a nonprofit group. "We're turning into a transient place."
Even Mayor Sharpe James acknowledges that the pace of development has been a bit too heady. "The success of the Ironbound could be its downfall as well," he said. Some are calling for a moratorium on new housing, although that is unlikely.
In the meantime, many homeowners are bracing for a revaluation of property, the first reassessment since 1961. City officials say that some tax bills could double or triple, something that lifelong residents like Linda Rodrigues fear could bring disaster.
Ms. Rodrigues, 49, chairwoman of the foreign languages department at the New School University in Manhattan, said she and many other property owners might be driven out by rising taxes.
"I've stayed here through some of Newark's darkest moments," said Ms. Rodrigues, who serves on the boards of the Newark Museum, the performing arts center and the public library. "But between overdevelopment and the reassessment, I don't know if I can survive much longer."

HEADLINE: Poll of Working Women Finds Them Stressed

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
A survey released yesterday found that one-fourth of working women hold a job that requires them to work at night or on weekends, while nearly half of working women work shifts different from those of their spouses or partners.
The survey, sponsored by the A.F.L.-C.I.O., found that many working women felt stressed and overstretched, with many complaining that their employers did not offer flexible hours, paid sick leave or child-care benefits. 
 The survey of 765 working women over 18 years of age found that 60 percent of working women toiled 40 or more hours a week and that women with minor children were more likely than other women to work different shifts from their husbands. Fifty-one percent of women with children under 18 work different hours from their spouses or partners, while 46 percent of all working women do.
The survey was conducted to articulate what issues are important to women with an eye to pressuring politicians to heed their concerns. Many priorities expressed by the women surveyed dovetailed with the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s legislative program, which calls for making quality health care more affordable and strengthening laws to provide benefits and better pay for part-time and temporary workers.
The survey, conducted by Lake Snell Perry & Associates, found that the No. 1 legislative priority for women was stronger equal pay laws, because many women were unhappy that women earn on average 73 cents for every dollar men earn. Eighty-seven percent of women surveyed said such laws were a priority, while 84 percent said quality, affordable health care was a priority and 83 percent stressed expanding the Family and Medical Leave Act to provide paid leave.
The survey also found that 34 percent of women said their employers did not provide them with flexible hours and 74 percent do not provide child-care benefits. The survey, conducted from Jan. 6 to 11, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
"One of the reasons for work-family pressures is that working women are having to work full and crazy schedules just to keep up with today's instant economy, " said Karen Nussbaum, director of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s Working Women's Department.
A.F.L.-C.I.O. officials said they would seek to mobilize working women this November to vote for candidates who address women's concerns. Last October, the labor federation, which represents 13 million unionized workers, endorsed Vice President Al Gore's bid for the presidency.
Frank Coleman, communications director of the United States Chamber of Commerce, criticized the women's survey, saying it was a pretext to advance labor's political agenda.
Mr. Coleman said it was ironic that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. was calling for more flexibility in the workplace when labor unions have repeatedly blocked business-backed legislation that would make it easier for corporations to offer more flexible hours.
Labor leaders say those laws are a subterfuge designed to deprive workers of overtime pay.

HEADLINE: MINIMUM WAGE RISE OF $1 IS APPROVED

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
The House agreed today to increase the federal minimum wage by $1 to $6.15 an hour but coupled the measure to a $123 billion tax-cut package sponsored by the Republicans and subject of a threatened veto by President Clinton, imperiling the raise.
Republicans staged separate votes on the two measures, seeking to defuse a politically potent Democratic issue in the November election by promoting one of their own, tax cuts, and then merged the two measures into one bill. 
 The political effect, however, is that the measures negate each other.
"I will veto the bill Republicans in the House passed tonight if it comes to my desk," Mr. Clinton said in a statement tonight.
The final vote on the wage increase was 282 to 143. But the crucial vote, taken earlier on a Democratic amendment to spread the raise over two years instead of three, passed by a narrower margin, 246 to 179.
On that measure, which gives more money sooner to more than 10 million Americans toiling at the bottom of the economic ladder, 42 Republicans joined 203 Democrats and 1 independent in favor, while 173 Republicans, 5 Democrats and 1 independent opposed. When it became clear this would be the bill's final version, 36 Republicans switched their votes on final passage.
Proponents of the tax cuts said they would ease the impact of the wage increase on employers, pensioners and poor rural and urban communities. But Democrats denounced the cuts as largely benefiting the rich.
Two-thirds of the tax bill's 10-year cost comes from a gradual reduction in the estate tax, $78.6 billion over the decade, with Democrats calling the measure a giveaway to people with annual incomes over $319,000.
That tax measure passed, 257 to 169, with 41 Democrats joining 215 Republicans and 1 independent in favor, and 167 Democrats, 1 Republican and 1 independent voting against.
Last month, the Senate approved an overhaul of bankruptcy laws that included a $1 increase in the minimum wage over three years and $76 billion in tax breaks over 10 years. House and Senate negotiators must now reconcile the competing versions.
Looming over those talks was Mr. Clinton's threat to veto the overall bill because it repeals key overtime protections and provides tax breaks that gobble up too much of the projected budget surplus that could be used to shore up Medicare and Social Security.
"Congress should send me a bill I can sign: a clean straightforward bill that raises the minimum wage by a dollar over two years," Mr. Clinton said in the statement. Combined with the House's passage last month of a bill to cut taxes for married couples by $182 billion over the next decade, Republicans have now approved two pillars of their $792 billion, 10-year tax plan that Mr. Clinton vetoed last year.
This year, Republicans have adopted the strategy of breaking out important parts of that bill and ramming them through the House, knowing that the measure's prospects in the Senate are uncertain and that it is doomed at the White House.
But in an election year, House Republicans are willing to pocket the floor votes as legislative triumphs and portray the White House as out of step with public opinion.
"Once again, Democrats are fighting tax relief, all tax relief," said Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who heads the House Ways and Means Committee.
The tax package would gradually increase the 401(k) contribution limit and make other pension changes. It would make health insurance premiums fully tax deductible for self-employed people sooner than under current law. As well, it would increase the amount of business meals that could be deducted and repeal accounting rules that require small business owners to pay capital gains immediately on the sale of their businesses, even if paid by the buyer in installments.
Republicans staged the dual votes tonight on the minimum wage and tax breaks to prevent Democrats from pushing through their own pay raise, which has support from moderate Republicans from the Northeast.
But instead of waging a contentious battle as they did in 1996, the last time Congress increased the minimum wage, Republican leaders acknowledged that a pay raise was an election-year inevitability. The only questions centered on when the increases would take effect and how large the tax cuts would be.
About 10 million full-time workers paid the minimum wage now earn about $10,700 a year. Raising their wages to $6.15 an hour would increase their annual earnings by $2,000, enough, supporters say, for a low-income family of four to buy groceries for seven months or pay rent for five months. Spreading the increase over three years would have cost workers $900.
Nearly 70 percent of workers earning the minimum wage are adults, and about 60 percent of them are women, according to a report by the White House's National Economic Council.
"In this era of prosperity, we should ensure that no workers are left behind," said Representative Sherwood L. Boehlert, a New York Republican who supported the increase over two years.
Critics of the wage increase said that the raise would kill jobs, particularly for younger workers. "We're cutting off the bottom rung," said Representative Roscoe G. Bartlett, a Maryland Republican.
Today's floor debate came after two days of negotiations between House Republicans leaders and a group of conservative Republicans, led by Representative Jim DeMint of South Carolina, who threatened to delay the overall bill unless it included their provision to allow states to choose whether to carry out the wage increases.
But the conservatives backed down after Speaker J. Dennis Hastert urged them to stick with their Republican colleagues and not hand Democrats a political coup by blocking the popular wage increase.

HEADLINE: Teaching Johnny Values Where Money Is King

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

DATELINE: PALO ALTO, Calif., March 9

 BODY:
Every day after school, 13-year-old Jeffrey Mendelman has a peanut butter and jelly sandwich with milk, finishes his homework -- and checks his stocks.
"My dad's stock was going up," Jeffrey says of his decision to plunge into the market, and he now follows stocks the way he collects autographs and baseball cards. "Most kids here are interested in the market. Because a lot of their dads have become pretty rich and that's why they get to live in a gigantic house." 
 A new sort of American childhood is being forged in the land where each day brings the dawn of an estimated 60 new millionaires. It is one in which C.E.O.'s are the super heroes, family banter is often likely to include talk of multiples and I.P.O.'s, and where a recent collision between two students in a high school parking lot involved a Toyota S.U.V. Forerunner and a Mercedes 500 SL.
But along with a new openness about money, and the good things it can bring, have come concerns about the effect of Silicon Valley's bountiful wealth on children, issues that are likely to escalate as the post-adolescent entrepreneurs, barely old enough themselves to have graduated from Ramen noodles on a hot plate, come of age.
The peculiar challenges of wealth, or what is now being referred to in the Valley as "the sudden wealth syndrome," have themselves spawned a variety of enterprises dedicated to helping the rich be rich, or what Judy G. Barber, a marriage and family counselor, calls "the unique issues that children of affluence face." Ms. Barber, with offices in Napa, San Francisco and Palo Alto, also publishes the newsletter, "Family Money: Commentary on the Unspoken Issues Related to Wealth."
Three years ago, Dr. Stephen Goldbart, a psychologist, co-founded the Money, Meaning and Choices Institute, a private practice in San Francisco, to "explore the psychological opportunities and emotional challenges of having and inheriting money." Dr. Goldbart calls the Bay Area "ground zero for the expanded upper class," foreshadowing the "largest intergenerational transfer of wealth in history."
Financial institutions are also responding. Merrill Lynch, for one, recently instituted a "financial parenting" program geared toward children to "heighten awareness of wealth's responsibilities," said Scott Cooper, a senior client relationship manager. It includes investment lessons for children as well as guidance on the so-called "affluenza syndrome," helping clients answer such questions as, "Daddy, why are we flying a private plane?"
Answer: "We've had a little luck but we've worked hard for it."
On El Camino Real, the Champs-Elysees of the new economy, Liz Gannes, a senior at Palo Alto Senior High, reflected on the unusual environment of her youth, of going to organized "schmooze fests" for techies and weddings where people "eat, talk and make deals."
"It's hard to ground ourselves sometimes," Ms. Gannes observed, echoing the feelings of many of her peers. "The things we hear on the news are happening all around us. We're living on top of this bubble and we're not able to see below us."
On jogging trails and bridle paths here, money and how it affects children -- a subject once more taboo than sex and death -- has become a major topic of parenting. One high-net-worth mother in Portola Valley, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: "My kids have absolutely no idea we have more money than other kids, but at ages 5 and 8 that's easy to enforce. Soon, all they'll have to do to find out their fathers' net worth is look on the Internet or read the paper. It's embarrassing. I'm nervous for my children."
The landscape of 17-year-old Alexa T.'s childhood in Atherton is one of swimming pools, guest houses and gardener-maintained property where full-grown trees are helicoptered in, and it brings this view: "In school you're learning as fast as you can so you can apply it as fast as you can so that you can become rich and successful by age 24, because that's what happens here."
Her mother, Elizabeth, complains: "It's the money that comes first. They're not talking about the Ph.D. They're talking about the $20 million and the house in Atherton."
The rapid pace of technological change, the long hours required of start-ups, the making of vast fortunes at an early age, have brought with them new challenges for families, said Paul Schervish, a professor of sociology at Boston College who is studying the effects nationally of the recent surge in family wealth.
"The material life of this period has accelerated way beyond our spiritual understanding of it," Professor Schervish said. "For the first time we can no longer use 'we can't afford it' as a cultural limit.
"Parents themselves are living a more intense life, working faster and harder. Part of the new economy is this notion that you either move forward or you'll fall back, and those pressures and values are getting passed on to children. Parents feel more of a connection between what their kids are doing now and their fortunes in the future."
To Kris Goodrich, a co-founder of the Child and Family Institute, a nonprofit center in Menlo Park, the fear "that you're the only one that can't keep up" has become pervasive. Her center offers stress classes for preteen children and family discussion programs about values. Ms. Goodrich said: "Children look at the middle class as poverty and going to Hawaii only once a year is considered the bottom rung.
"The loud voice, the Silicon voice, says, 'If you're not constantly updating and going the next jump every day you're replaceable. That puts a tremendous strain on parents. They look at the children and think, 'I've got to give them everything.' They overprovide, because they want them to keep up."
An 11-year-old boy she knows made a fervent wish last year: to simplify his overbooked life. "It's not so much the money as the life style they perceive they have to have," Ms. Goodrich said.
Dr. Gerald D. Bell, a consultant and professor at the graduate school of business at the University of North Carolina, spoke of a father here who recently took his three daughters for a ski vacation in Gstaad, Switzerland. The father told each daughter they could bring a friend. "They spent two weeks in luxury, with unlimited room service," Dr. Bell said. "When they came back to school, the friends were telling friends, and the girls suddenly started getting a lot of social invitations. Even the coaches on teams were being deferential.
"Other kids see the preferential treatment and get mad. So these kids get a double-whammy, asking themselves, 'Do they like me or do they just want to get invited to Gstaad?' "
The flip side of parents staking their claim to Silicon Valley gold can be desolate. Laura M., 17, spoke softly in recalling her mother's plunge into a start-up: "My mom said, 'I'm going to spend a lot of time at work. Is that O.K. with you?' I would have felt bad saying no. The big problem was I was used to having her around to say, 'Don't talk on the phone' and 'Don't watch TV.' "
Laura's grades plummeted, prompting her parents to pull back on their hours somewhat. "The thing I really hate is coming home to the dark," Laura said. "It's a big house."
An undercurrent of parental regret runs through the conversations of some teenagers whose parents feel they have somehow missed the boom. "My parents are doctors," Lisa M., 17, said. "But when they see tons of money, I think they feel sort of left out. Compared to the C.E.O. of Cisco Systems, my dad feels totally insignificant."
At Palo Alto Senior High, a school with robotics classes and electronic lockers, Esther Wojcicki, a revered teacher, has noticed a change in role models among her students. Rather than Michael Jordan and Michelle Kwan, Ms. Wojcicki said: "Their heros are the 20-year-olds with start-up companies who've made $20 million. It's made more intense, because they know them."
In a milieu that respects divergent thinking, even students themselves are becoming legends for their exploits. Among them is Hans Pang, 17, the son of a bank teller and an acupuncturist. Three years ago, a friend's father, Dominic Orr, the chief executive of Alteon Web Systems, in San Jose, offered Mr. Pang a summer job after hearing about his computer wizardry. Mr. Pang's performance during the summers was such that last year, the company, which was going public, offered him employee stock options in lieu of salary in recognition of his work.
"I said yes, since I'd heard about I.P.O.'s skyrocketing and had a good feeling about the company," Mr. Pang said. His shares are currently worth about $75,000, on paper.
"I was earning $10 an hour, which wasn't bad," said Mr. Pang, who has a buzz cut and doles out business cards. "I was happy. But obviously this has made me more happy."
Eric Bloom, an economics teacher at Paly, as the high school is known, realized the culture had shifted when he began noticing that some students were becoming bored when simulated stocks were introduced in class. "It turned out they already had their own real ones," Mr. Bloom said.
A positive side of all this, some of the parents and children say, is a feeling among young people that success is just a step away, rather than a climb up the ladder.
Yet as the dot-com millionaires come of age, parents, educators and mental health professionals worry that the sense of entitlement that has long characterized the proverbial indolent trust-funder will flourish. "It used to be, 'My daddy can beat up your daddy,' " said Mark Walsh, founder of VerticalNet Inc., a Web site company in suburban Philadelphia. "Now it's, 'My daddy can buy your daddy.' "
Joan Lonergan, head of the Castilleja School, a private school for girls here where community service is required for graduation, said wealth is one of the biggest issue facing parents. "People here aren't brain-dead," Ms. Lonergan said. "They're looking hard at values, because everything in the community is focused on money."
Some parents are using their wealth to reconfigure values. Richard Lowenthal, 47, for instance, retired three years ago after his telecommunications company, Stratacom, was bought by Cisco Systems. The father of two daughters, ages 15 and 11, he now spends half his time in community service and is mayor-elect of the Valley town of Cupertino.
Mr. Lowenthal, noting that there are no 12-step programs for workaholics, said: "I've been through that intensity. People whose own self-worth is measured by how much money they have are far more common here than people who can give it a rest. We need more people to set an example for being more whole."
Debra Engel, 47, a single mother of two, retired recently from the 3Com Corporation, which she joined as a start-up. Ms. Engel said she had set "a number I aspired to" that she felt would financially allow her to be at home full time with her children, now 10 and 13. "I'm a great believer that making your own way in the world is important to who you are and who you become," she said. "Many of us have come by this wealth serendipitously. How do my children develop a sense that that's unusual?"
One of Ms. Engel's strategies has been to involve her children in philanthropy, including helping make decisions on where the money goes and visiting inner-city nonprofit organizations she has helped finance through the Community Foundation of Silicon Valley, a private nonprofit group in San Jose.
Of having money, she observed: "It can make you think, 'How should I live?' You not only get tested in life when bad things happen, but when good things happen, too."
Young people like Minal Hasan, 17, daughter of an entrepreneur mother and a venture-capitalist father, seem acutely aware of the unusualness of their lives, of intense family discussions about first- and second-round financing, school lunch chatter about Bloomberg, of endlessly winding driveways with underground garages. "Some day," she observed, "this whole time period will be in the textbooks, like the Vietnam War."

HEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE SAYS VOTES ARE LACKING ON CHINESE TRADE

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 9

 BODY:
The Clinton administration conceded today that it does not yet have the votes to approve a decisive China trade accord, as a lobbying battle was shaping up for the 130 or so uncommitted House members who will decide the fate of the president's most important remaining foreign policy goal.
The fight over whether to grant permanent normal trading privileges to China reveals fault lines in the nation's political and business communities that will surely grow by June, when the House will probably vote. Odd coalitions have sprung up in opposition, from liberal Democrats who abhor China's labor and environmental standards to conservative Republicans who criticize Beijing's human rights record and threats against Taiwan. 
 A day after Mr. Clinton formally called on lawmakers to approve the accord, the administration's point man on the measure, Commerce Secretary William M. Daley, acknowledged that the outcome, particularly in the House, was too close to call.
"We probably don't have the votes right now," Mr. Daley told reporters today after briefing executives on the accord. "Members are still trying to grapple with this. They're still wondering whether it's going to happen. It's very fluid."
Organized labor, especially the Teamsters and United Auto Workers, has made defeating the agreement its top legislative priority this year, both to preserve jobs at home and to put pressure on China to raise its labor standards. Business groups, on the other hand, kicked off a $1.5 million advertising campaign last weekend to expound on the benefits of expanded trade with China.
"No one's pulled a gun on me yet, but the lobbying is significant," said Representative Bart Gordon of Tennessee, an uncommitted Democrat whose late switch in 1993 to support the North American Free Trade Agreement gave Mr. Clinton a crucial vote to pass that accord.
In another complication for Mr. Clinton, some conservatives are considering amending the bill to increase military ties between Taiwan and the United States, a move that China and the White House strongly oppose. Moreover, Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, urged Mr. Clinton last week to act positively on Taiwan's request for advanced weaponry, including four warships equipped with sophisticated radar and antimissile systems, which are built in Pascagoula, Miss., and Bath, Me.
Last fall, the administration promised Beijing it would work to grant China permanent trade status as part of a larger package to bring China into the World Trade Organization. In the bilateral deal, China agreed to open a wide range of its markets, from agriculture to telecommunications, a potential boon to American farmers and companies.
"Bringing China into the rules-based trading system is a win-win-win for American workers, American businesses and American values," said Representative David Dreier, a California Republican.
To close the deal, Congress is being asked to give up its annual review of China's trade status and grant it the permanent trading privileges that the United States gives most other countries. Congress has always approved this status.
What would happen if Congress votes down normal trade relations is debated. China would probably still join the World Trade Organization. But the administration says that American companies would not enjoy the benefits of the agreement -- lower tariffs on their goods and greater access to China's markets -- while Europe and Japan would.
China, however, may decide it is economically unwise to anger the United States, and so might accept a continuation of the status quo for a time, keeping the trade status up for renewal but withholding the marketing-opening measures.
The timing of the votes on Capitol Hill is crucial. The administration is pushing for votes by the Memorial Day recess to avoid bumping up against the political parties' conventions this summer, and to reduce the chances that new provocations by China would undercut support for the legislation. But Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the majority leader, has said the House would more likely take the bill up in June.
Mr. Clinton and his cabinet are meeting with lawmakers regularly to win support. Mr. Daley and Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman plan to take groups of wavering legislators to China next month.
Vice President Al Gore has sent mixed signals on the measure, telling labor leaders three weeks ago that he would negotiate something better if elected president, and later reiterating support for the deal. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumed Republican nominee, supports permanent normal trading status as a condition of bringing China into the World Trade Organization.
"It's clear the president believes that if he rushes this through before members can fully understand what's in the agreement, he can win," said Representative Peter A. DeFazio, an Oregon Democrat who opposes permanent trade status. "The longer this sits, the more probability we have of beating it."
Prospects for the bill's passage seem good in the Senate, which is typically more supportive of trade agreements than the House. In a test vote last July, the Senate rejected, 87 to 12, a nonbinding measure to end normal trading relations with China. No one expects the Senate to duplicate that margin for permanent trade status, but supporters now count at least 60 votes, the magic number needed to end a filibuster.
For that reason, the administration will probably try to get the Senate to vote first, with a vote in the pro-trade Finance Committee by late April, reversing the usual order of trade bills starting in the House.
"This will be well received in the Senate," said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a New York Democrat who strongly supports permanent trade relations with China and who complained two weeks ago that the White House needed to act soon.
Both Senator Lott and Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, predicted this week that the Senate would approve the measure after a spirited debate.
Senate opponents concede they face an uphill struggle, but said momentum has shifted in the past three months. "I don't say we have the votes to defeat this, but it's going to be a more intense fight than people thought," said Senator Paul Wellstone, a Minnesota Democrat. Senator Wellstone is among those who oppose the bill because, he says, allowing China into the trade organization would cause the United States' trade deficit with China to balloon.
Handicapping the House right now is like herding cats. But according to vote-counters on both sides, the math looks like this:
For several years, about 150 Republicans and 110 Democrats have voted to grant China normal trading status as part of the annual review. A bill needs 218 votes to pass the House if all members vote.
Republican vote-counters say they can probably produce at least 140 votes for granting permanent normal trade status, barring any new provocations by China, although they are short of that now. Democratic supporters say they can count on about 50 to 60 firm "yes" votes now, but insist that aggressive lobbying by business groups, Mr. Clinton and his top aides will harvest dozens of uncommitted Democrats.
By the count of some pro-trade lobbyists, at least 60 House Democrats are uncommitted. Some House critics say that number is closer to 20 or 30, and that the rest are leaning toward "no." Republicans say perhaps 70 of their rank and file are also uncommitted. Mr. Daley said today that the administration is focusing its efforts on about 50 of those 130 uncommitted members.
Legislators in farm states and in high-tech districts in California are under particular pressure from local interests to approve the bill.
Republican leaders, who fought Mr. Clinton over impeachment last year, are well aware that they would be delivering the majority of votes needed to cement a foreign policy triumph for the president. So they are trying pressure the Democrats to share the burden, aides say. That way if the measure fails, Republicans can blame the White House for not turning out its party.
"If the president gets us 100 Democrats, we'll be fine," said Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip, who supports the trade bill. Other supporters say that figure is unrealistic.
Last week, Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the second-ranking Democrat, said that 128 of 211 House Democrats were opposing the measure. He added that 30 of those opponents had supported China in annual reviews.
"We're in an early stage, but the momentum is with us," Mr. Bonior said today. "People are moving toward our position."
This may be true in some cases. Representative John Conyers Jr. of Michigan, a senior liberal Democrat who has voted for giving China normal trade status on a yearly basis, said he would oppose permanent status because it would be a mistake to surrender the leverage of an annual vote. Representative Brad Sherman, a California Democrat who has favored the trade status for China year by year, said the same.
But in interviews with about one-third of the 30 representatives who Mr. Bonior said had switched to opposing permanent status, some said they had not made up their minds. "I'm undecided," said Representative Martin T. Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat. "I'm willing to look at the administration's arguments."
Representative Ed Pastor, an Arizona Democrat, said he had heard from labor advocates who oppose the bill, as well as from orange growers, cotton farmers and executives from technology companies like Motorola and Honeywell in his district who support permanent trade status.
"I'm on the fence," he said.

HEADLINE: DESIGN REVIEW;
Ideazapoppin': Images Fly at Cooper-Hewitt

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

 BODY:
IS it too much to expect the National Design Museum to show a little design now and then? Finally Cooper-Hewitt has taken the plunge. With the first edition of its National Design Triennial the museum brings us real, living design. Not the history of design; not the sociology, anthropology, psychology, theory, politics or economics of design. Not Good Design, Green Design or Universal Design. Just Design, the whole field of American Design and nothing but Design.
The first in a series of survey exhibitions to be held every three years, it offers a bracing dunk in the present. Encompassing graphics, fashion, industrial products, architecture, interiors, furniture, toys, stage and movie sets, and computer animation, the show is not a Best of the Best contest. Projects by 83 designers and firms, all produced in the last three years, are not grouped by disciplines. Viewers may pick their own winners and losers. We expect survey shows to be irritating, and this one does not disappoint. Too often the ideas lose focus. There are vexing omissions and far-fetched connections. Still, this show makes design look like the most protean, fertile field this side of the Tigris and Euphrates. 
 It has been organized by Donald Albrecht and Ellen Lupton, two curators on Cooper-Hewitt's staff, along with Steven Skov Holt, a seasoned Silicon Valley denizen. Their synergy is infectious. They have taken what might be called the Josephine Baker approach to the bountiful subject. In concert performances Baker would toss peaches, apples, papayas and other fruits into the audience. At Cooper-Hewitt the curators pelt us with ideas. Color, light, form, image, movement, materials and technologies land in seemingly random arrangements of contemporary American style.
The Triennial is organized around eight themes, from Fluid to Unbelievable, with stops at Physical, Minimal, Reclaimed, Local, Branded and Narrative along the way. The logic behind these motifs is more intuitive than analytic. This is not to say that the curators lack discrimination. Their approach reflects the mercurial state of design today.
Fluid, the introductory theme, states the show's overarching message: dead or alive, natural or cultural, all things must morph. The section also documents a particular current circulating through architecture and design today. Greg Lynn's "Hydrogen House," created in 1996 for the Austrian Mineral Oil Company, exemplifies the movement toward "blob" architecture created with animation software. Frank O. Gehry's unbuilt project for 1 Times Square deploys folding fabric as an innovative building skin. The impact of both projects is rooted in the shifting, mutable nature of contemporary visual culture.
A second-floor gallery devoted to Branded design embraces without condescension Martha Stewart's antiseptically earthy gardening products. Seed packets and a remarkable poison-free bug killer are used to symbolize the power exercised by labels, logos and slogans in the world of mass consumption. But why include Ms. Stewart and not Ralph Lauren? Why ask why? We love Martha and we don't like Ralph. Go figure. Just do it. Whoosh.
The eight themes are themselves brands, meta-labels for objects whose existence hangs on their reception in the consumer marketplace. Although handbags by Kate Spade and a dress by Geoffrey Beene are displayed in a Minimal gallery, Spade and Beene are also outstanding brand names. So are Apple and, at this point, even Frank O. Gehry. Less established designers, like Stefan Sagmeister, shown in a photograph with his name carved into his naked torso, are labels in the making. Doesn't everyone want to be a trademark? Isn't that what's driving the explosion of all those FillInYourName.coms?
Many visitors will be impressed by the commercial aspect of this show. Some of the objects can actually be purchased at the Cooper-Hewitt gift shop. Others are available at fine stores everywhere, or online. Many of the objects have graced the covers and articles of that excellent trade magazine ID. An architect whose work is represented in the show told me that his first response on seeing it was to look around for a shopping cart. In short, it offers a field day for those who can't wait for another chance to whine about the breakdown of the cordon sanitaire between museum and marketplace.
In the case of museum design departments, however, such a boundary never existed. Since the 1930's the explicit purpose of design departments like that at the Museum of Modern Art was to encourage a rapprochement between art and industry. This had been the Bauhaus ideal. The Modern extended the ideal from production to consumption. The museum didn't design products. Instead it rewarded manufacturers for producing objects that Philip Johnson and subsequent curators found aesthetically pleasing. They Branded stuff with the Good Design label.
In the Good Design period, Branded and Minimal shared a similar, machine-based aesthetic. Today the two are complementary opposites. The Brand catapults more stuff into the world. Minimal design creates the illusion that stuff can be kept at bay. Michael Gambelli, who designed the Triennial, is an excellent illusionist. Using a Minimal palette of gray homisote panels, clear plexiglass containers, white fabric and empty space, he has kept the show from turning into Times Square. Mr. Gambelli has also achieved the remarkable feat of keeping the ornate interiors of Andrew Carnegie's mansion from undermining the entire idea of design.
Reclaimed, another Triennial theme, is the offspring of Branded and Minimal. Since stuff never really goes away, it might as well be made use of. Reclaimed is design's trash compactor. It shows what to do when Branded objects lose their value or aura. Don't throw away those webbed plastic straps that came wrapped around that shipment of clingy Diane von Furstenberg traveling pants suits. Make your own version of Constantin and Lorene Leon Boym's version of Breuer's Wassily chair! Breuer's aesthetic was based on industrial production. The Boym sensibility derives from the landfill end of the consumer system.
Images and ideas can be reclaimed along with physical castoffs. Peter Girardi, a retired graffiti writer based in Manhattan, collects old typefaces, printer's marks, candy wrappers and other signifiers cut loose from their signifieds. Then he posts them on a Web site: www.funnygarbage.com, a semiotic town dump. In contrast to the crisp, clean look of most computer graphics, Mr. Girardi and his associate, Chris Capuozzo, want Web pages to look like old newspapers blowing around the alley. Funny Garbage is working on "Pink Donkey and the Fly," a cartoon show on cable television.
Julie Bargmann's "Testing the Waters" is the most ambitious project in the Reclaimed section, and one of the best in the Triennial. A 45-acre park now under construction in Vintondale, Pa., it is reclaiming land polluted by the drainage from a former coal mine. To produce the design Ms. Bargmann, a landscape architect, recruited a historian, a hydrogeologist and a visual artist. They have produced what the curators call "a giant ecological washing machine" that invites visitors to witness basins, spillways and other stages in the water-cleansing process.
The themes slither through one another like a series of spinoffs and mergers. "Testing the Waters" would fit just as well or better in the section called Local, dedicated to our archaic attachment to place. The Local highlight is a remarkable house designed by Marwan Al-Sayed for a couple in Phoenix. Formerly employed by the New York architects Tod Williams and Billie Tsien (who are handsomely represented in the Physical part of the show), Mr. Al-Sayed uses thick masonry walls, metal trusses, tent fabric and the desert surroundings in a design that recalls Frank Lloyd Wright's Taliesin West.
Architecture in general is sketchily handled. The selections are choice but misleadingly labeled. Given the earnestness with which Steven Holl pursues architecture's metaphysical dimension, it is painfully obtuse to classify his M.I.T. dormitory under Physical. Nor is Neil Denari's work all that Fluid. Scary is more like it. With a vocabulary derived from space age technology, his designs tend toward the hard-edged. Beautifully conceived, Mr. Denari's projects are beginning to look like cold war antiques.
Richard Gluckman and Robert Wilson's project for the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust is filed under Minimal but is also a good example of Reclaimed, or even Branded. The design drapes backlighted, translucent theatrical scrims over the side walls of old industrial buildings that are being recycled into Pittsburgh's new arts district. A form of subliminal advertising, devoid of words or images, the design is a refreshing antidote to the cloying, scenographic buildings of Michael Graves and Charles Moore.
If Walter Pater were alive today, he might well conclude that all art aspires to the condition of movie titles. Examples of the genre, created by the Hollywood company Imaginary Forces, are found in the Physical galleries, and it is true that these haunting, hilarious and brilliant montages provoke a visceral response. Created for "Seven," "Mimic" and "Dead Man on Campus," these short films should come with a warning attached: please don't reveal the beginning.
The show's final two segments are utterly misnamed. Most of the work displayed under the Narrative rubric is actually illustrational. Projects by David Rockwell, Julie Taymor, Gary Lloyd and David Gallo are fine examples of scenographic art, but there is nothing narrative about them. Narration, in architecture and design, refers to a spatial or visual sequence that duplicates the formal structure of storytelling. That structure, analyzed by Russian linguists in the early 20th century, proceeds from an initial state of equilibrium through a series of unbalancing episodes to a final, heightened state of equipoise. (Think of rising, by stages, to the top of the Eiffel Tower.)
Lebbeus Woods's project is the only one in the section that follows a true narrative structure. Titled "Civilization," it is part of an exhibition that is to open in Berlin in May. Intentionally or not, the design recreates in architectural form the world according to Richard Rorty, author of the influential 1989 book "Contingency, Irony and Solidarity." Mr. Rorty, our most enlightened contemporary philosopher, has reflected on ways of adapting to rapid cultural change. Mr. Woods, whose previous work includes visionary studies of war-torn Sarajevo, has created a dystopic environment of sharp, fragmented shapes that will serve as an installation for a show on fantasies of 21st-century life.
Unbelievable, the show's final section, would be more accurately titled Next. Given the objects already seen, it is all too easy to believe that the projects gathered here, or variants of them, will soon be on the market. David Small's "Talmud Project" is a work of genius. A prototype for an interactive book, produced at the M.I.T. Media Lab, the project may be the Triennial's most powerful piece of architecture. Combining passages from the Torah and the Talmud, in English and French translations, the software enables viewers to manipulate blocks of text into the walls, streets and windows in an imaginary city of words.
The only thing that is truly Unbelievable at Cooper-Hewitt (apart from Martha Stewart's poison-free bug killer) is the entire exhibition. In recent years New Yorkers have come to depend on Moss, the SoHo store, for close-up inspections of new design. This routine reversed the standard protocol in Good Design days, when a museum display of well-designed objects preceded by some years the establishment of retail outlets where consumers could buy them. It is refreshing to see commercial and curatorial intelligence brought into closer alignment.
The Triennial was conceived a few years ago by Dianne H. Pilgrim, who stepped down as the director of Cooper-Hewitt in January. What a great parting gift.

HEADLINE: Geoffrey H. Moore, 86, Dies; An Analyst of Business Cycles

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr. 

 BODY:
Geoffrey H. Moore, who wanted to run a chicken farm but instead became a world-renowned analyst of business cycles, died Thursday at his home in Bloomfield, Conn. He was 86 years old.
Dr. Moore rose to prominence during a 30-year career at the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private body in Cambridge, Mass., that, among other things, is the quasi-official arbiter of when recessions begin and end. He also became a prominent figure in academe and in Washington, where he served as commissioner of labor statistics during the Nixon administration. 
 One of his Statistics I students at New York University in 1946 was Alan Greenspan, now chairman of the Federal Reserve, who yesterday called his former teacher "a major force in economic statistics and business-cycle research for more than a half-century." Mr. Greenspan told Congress in 1994 that he closely followed all of Dr. Moore's work, which focused mainly on economic fluctuations and ways of measuring them.
Dr. Moore continued this work until his death, having founded at age 82 in New York the Economic Cycle Research Institute, whose innovative gauge for predicting inflation has climbed in recent months.
Dr. Moore, a protege of Wesley Clair Mitchell and Arthur F. Burns, the founders of formal business cycle analysis, added much pioneering work of his own. For example, after the profession had responded to a Depression-era request by the Roosevelt administration to generate statistics that could point to revival, Dr. Moore enlarged on this work in 1950 to include economic downturns as well as recoveries.
"In a sense, he was the father of the leading indicators as we know them today," said Anirvan Banerji, co-director of research with Dr. Moore at the Economic Cycle Research Institute.
Later he refined so-called diffusion indexes so that each of their disparate forecasting components could be seen in their own cyclical contexts, preventing distortions that would otherwise arise from comparing unlike factors.
Ultimately, the Commerce Department adopted as its own the series of leading, coincident and lagging economic indicators that Dr. Moore developed with Julius Shiskin, his predecessor as head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. These indicators tend to warn of turning points in the economy by moving ahead of it or to confirm turns by moving at the same time or even lagging behind economic developments.
Although this series, now privatized, became less reliable in the 1990's, Dr. Moore was one of the few to correctly predict the brief 1990-1991 recession, which he said was only set off, not caused, by the Persian Gulf war.
For the last 20 years or more, Dr. Moore insisted on distinguishing between inflation cycles and economic cycles, implying that weak growth did not rule out rapid inflation, as occurred in the 1970's, and that inflation could decline in the face of strong growth, as occurred, to the surprise of many, in the 1990's.
Dr. Moore, whose father was in the real estate business, grew up in rural Pequannock, N.J., went to high school in Montclair, N.J., and graduated from the College of Agriculture at Rutgers University intent on a career in poultry after having worked after school and summers for a chicken farmer.
A professor induced him to return to graduate school, however, and he wound up studying under Dr. Burns, who in 1939 engaged the young agricultural economist as a research associate at the National Bureau.
Dr. Moore taught at N.Y.U. as well as Rutgers, Columbia University and the Colorado School of Mines and was a senior research fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford. He held a Ph.D. in economics from Harvard.
In the early 1970's he left Washington after accusations that he was part of the Nixon administration's efforts to politicize the Bureau of Labor Statistics, accusations that a House committee found largely unfounded. In 1979, at Rutgers, Dr. Moore set up the Center for International Business Cycle Research, which was moved to Columbia in 1983 for greater computer capacity.
A financial dispute with Columbia after Dr. Moore agreed to turn over rights to his work led him and his associates to leave in 1996 to found the Economic Cycle Research Institute on Lexington Avenue. This week, by apparent coincidence, Columbia told him that he could expect to have the rights returned to him.
In his later years, Dr. Moore spent much of his time developing a forecasting index for inflation and extending his work on business cycles and forecasting indexes to dozens of other countries.
He is survived by his wife, the former Melita Riley; two sons, Stephen, of Tolland, Conn., and Peter, of Fort Thomas, Ky.; two daughters, Kathleen Holness, of Somerset, N.J., and Pamela Pelligrino, of Center Harbor, N.H.; and a stepson, Bryant Riley of Mount Sterling, Ohio. Dr. Moore's first wife and the mother of his children, Ella C. Goldschmid, died in 1975.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS;
Nasdaq Is Barely Higher; Other Indexes Close Down

BYLINE: By Reuters 

 BODY:
The Nasdaq composite index edged higher yesterday, its second consecutive record close above the 5,000 level, despite losses in blue-chip stocks, after another consumer products company, the Dial Corporation, warned of disappointing earnings.
The Nasdaq, which on Thursday finished above 5,000 for the first time, ended with a gain of 1.76 points, at 5,048.62. 
 The index had been as high as 5,132.52, but a bout of late selling short-circuited its gains, sending it briefly into negative territory before it inched higher at the close.
"It was a combination of a tough week and it was Friday," said Ned Collins, head of trading at Daiwa Securities America. "People were anxious to get flat for the weekend in the last few hours; some of the leaders were giving up a little; and the bidders just pulled out."
Other major gauges fell. The Dow Jones industrial average declined 81.91 points, or 0.82 percent, to 9,928.82. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dropped 6.62 points, or 0.47 percent, to 1,395.07. Declining stocks on the Big Board exceeded those advancing, 1,701 to 1,266.
"The disappointment from Dial reinforces the feeling that tech is the only game in town," said Guy Truicko, portfolio manager at Unity Management in Garden City, N.Y.
Dial -- the maker of soap, Purex laundry detergent and other consumer products -- warned of a 10-to-12-percent drop in its first-half profit two days after Procter & Gamble dealt the Dow index a blow, saying its earnings would be disappointing.
Dial fell 3 1/4 yesterday, to 11, in New York Stock Exchange trading, and during the session, touched a low not seen since late 1994. Procter & Gamble declined a further 4 1/2, to 53, its lowest close since November 1996.
Financial services stocks were volatile amid speculation of merger deals in the wake of Thursday's announcement in Germany that Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank would merge, jettisoning retail branches to focus on the lucrative investment banking business.
"People are thinking they may be getting into the U.S. market and are looking for an acquisition," said Amy Butte, an analyst with Bear, Stearns.
Shares of the Goldman Sachs Group, which surged as high as 119, closed with a gain of 5 1/16 at 112 1/4, and Morgan Stanley Dean Witter rose 4 1/8, to 86 5/8. Both touched intraday highs during the session.
Chase Manhattan fell 2 7/16 , to 78 11/16 , with traders speculating that the bank was seeking acquisitions. Chase said it would not comment as a matter of policy on the unusual trading in its stock after an explanation was requested by the New York Stock Exchange. The discount broker Charles Schwab jumped 5 1/16 , to 52. Schwab also refused to comment about a Big Board request for information on trading activity.
Transportation stocks, laggards this year, rose yesterday. The Dow Jones transportation average gained more than 1 percent after crude oil prices slipped. An OPEC official said the United States was asking producers for an additional 2.5 million barrels a day of crude oil.
Some semiconductor stocks surged, led by Rambus, up 41 35/64 , to 421, after the company announced a four-for-one stock split, and Motorola, up 10, to 172 1/2, after it said its business prospects for 2000 are strong in all regions of the world. Some computer disk-drive stocks added to recent gains.
Biotechnology issues, which have been giving back some of their gains lately, were lower for a fourth day.
For the week, the Nasdaq rose 133.83 points, or 2.72 percent, but the Dow industrials fell 438.38 points, or 4.23 percent.
Next week, economists and Wall Street analysts will get reports on wholesale and retail prices, which could give hints of any inflation.
In the fixed-income market yesterday, the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 1 1/32 , to 101 1/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 6.17 percent from 6.15 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Britain Agrees to Support Germany's I.M.F. Candidate

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, March 10

 BODY:
Breaking days of conspicuous silence, Britain today endorsed Germany's substitute candidate to run the International Monetary Fund, significantly broadening his support within the European Union.
But with finance ministers from the 15-nation union meeting on Monday to decide officially on a candidate, it remained uncertain whether they would all unify behind the German, Horst Kohler. 
 "We cannot say today that there is a consensus," said a spokesman for Portugal, which currently holds the European Union's rotating presidency.
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain added his voice to those supporting Mr. Kohler only after days of saying nothing, reportedly cloaking a rift between him and Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the exchequer, who remained uncertain of Mr. Kohler's credentials.
Mr. Kohler, a German economist and former high official in the German Finance Ministry, is currently head of the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which invests in countries of the former Soviet bloc. He is the second candidate put forward by Chancellor Gerhard Schroder. The first, Caio Koch-Weser, who secured only ambiguous support in Europe, was vetoed by President Clinton because of what the American administration called Mr. Koch-Weser's lack of stature.
Despite that rebuff, the German leader is pressing a campaign to have a compatriot take over as managing director of the I.M.F., which has traditionally been run by a European since its creation after World War II. For much of that time, it has been run by senior French officials, like Michel Camdessus, the previous managing director.
Reflecting a new assertiveness, Germany's government now believes it is Germany's turn to run one of the world's most influential financial institutions. After Britain announced its support, a German spokesman said, "We are well on the way to agreeing on a common European candidate."
A European consensus is vital before Mr. Kohler's candidacy is put before the I.M.F. directors in Washington. Mr. Kohler has said publicly he wants assurances of broad support for his candidacy from the I.M.F. shareholders. But, while Mr. Schroder has enlisted Dutch, French, Portuguese and British backing, Italy and Spain have remained silent and the United States has been noncommittal.
Washington reiterated its position today. A White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said, "We're looking for a European candidate who has consensus support in Europe, who has support in the developing world, a gentleman or a woman who's got maximum stature."
Earlier today in Brussels, the Secretary of State, Madeleine K. Albright, said that while Washington supported the idea of a European candidate, "the important thing is to find one that has the right qualifications and the consensus." She did not, however, mention Mr. Kohler specifically.
The United States has made clear it wants a political heavyweight to take the job, while Italy is believed by many Europeans to be harboring ambitions for a candidate of its own, Giuliano Amato, the treasury secretary.
German officials regarded Britain's support as an important part of the effort to build a unanimous European stance. Mr. Schroder, the chancellor, also says he has support from South Korea and from Eastern European leaders who have come to know Mr. Kohler through his work at the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
Established in 1991, the bank invests in mainly business-sector projects in Eastern and Central Europe and Russia as part of a mandate to foster economic and political change.
A British government spokesman declined to say whether Mr. Blair had consulted with President Clinton before making known his support for the German candidate. "We have made clear now who we think should do the job, but will leave the Americans to decide whom they want to support," the spokesman said.

HEADLINE: NATO Chief in Kosovo Fears a Cross-Border Insurgency

BYLINE: By CARLOTTA GALL 

DATELINE: PRISTINA, Kosovo, March 10

 BODY:
The commander of peacekeeping troops in Kosovo, with the former political leader of the disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army beside him, vowed today to stop any insurgency mounted from Kosovo into Serbia.
The warning came at a joint news conference when the commander, Gen. Klaus Reinhardt, was joined by Hashim Thaci, the Albanian leader. The appearance, which Mr. Thaci was urged to make by Gen. Wesley K. Clark, NATO's supreme commander, was an effort to send a political message to the population of Kosovo and beyond into Serbia. 
 Albanian leaders here are warning that tension in the Presevo Valley between the ethnic Albanian population and Serbian police forces is only going to worsen. And while the civilian population is overwhelmingly against more conflict, refugees from the Presevo area are arriving almost daily in Kosovo, spreading a deep sense of foreboding that the crisis is already unstoppable.
General Reinhardt warned of the dangers today. "This situation along the Kosovo and Presevo Valley border region constitutes a threat to peace and security for Kosovo, and could develop into a regional security issue," he said at Camp Monteith, the American base in eastern Kosovo. "Any insurgent activity based in Kosovo and the conduct of cross border operations cannot and will not be condoned or tolerated."
Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, the leader of American forces in Kosovo, who was also present, issued a written statement that his force had "significantly increased its security posture" on the border and was prepared to "take all necessary actions to ensure that Kosovo is not used as a staging base for exporting violence into the Presevo Valley," and would oppose "any attempts to extend violence back into Kosovo."
The statements were intended as a political message, said Capt. Russell Berg, an American military public affairs officer. American troops have already built new watchtowers on the border and stepped up surveillance. "The message is, we are absolutely not going to be drawn into anything," he said.
James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, who helped negotiate the disarmament of the Kosovo Liberation Army after the war, intends to press Mr. Thaci and other Albanian leaders to stem the violence when he visits Kosovo this weekend, officials said.
Mr. Thaci and leaders of the Kosovo Protection Corps, the civilian structure that has replaced the liberation army, are apparently already listening and are moving to take the appropriate public stands. In an interview this week, just after a meeting in Kosovo with General Clark, Mr. Thaci clearly stated that the Presevo Valley, long a majority Albanian area and once part of Kosovo, was not his concern.
"I respect the right of the Albanians in Presevo. They should have the rights of democratic citizens. But in Kosovo we have different circumstances and we now have a different approach to the region," he said. "Now as the president of a political party in Kosovo, my concerns only cover the territory of Kosovo."
He stressed that Albanians did not want violence. "More than anyone else in the region, Albanians know what violence means," he said.
But Ramush Haradinaj, a powerful commander of the former Kosovo Liberation Army and now the deputy commander of the civilian force, showed a more independent mind.
While Mr. Haradinaj, one of the most renowned fighters of the war, said the armed insurgency in Presevo will only worsen the situation, he refused to condemn the men who are now trying to fight the Serbian police in southern Serbia. "I am against Milosevic," he said, referring to President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia. "I think they should protect themselves. It initiates more problems but I respect their decision. If I were in charge of the region, I would do the same."
He denied that he and his supporters are part of a new fighting force, the Liberation Army of Presevo, Medvedja and Bujanovac. The army is a nascent guerrilla force that recently made a public stand to defend the Albanian population in southern Serbia. It is reportedly organized by former members of the liberation army and is thought to have strong backing from some of that group's senior leaders.
But Mr. Haradinaj admitted that former fighters, who are unemployed and disillusioned with the new corps, and also men from the Presevo area who fought in Kosovo, are likely to join the new force.
Foreign officials in Kosovo say that the K.L.A. no longer exists as a viable organization and that many of the leading characters have gone their different ways. Mr. Thaci has founded his own political party but cannot count on the support of all the major commanders of the liberation army. Mr. Haradinaj, for example, is expected to announce the forming of his own party soon.
Yet much of the old network clearly remains. Men who are fighting over the border are moving freely in and out of Kosovo and are visibly maintaining links with old comrades now in Kosovo's civilian force.
Many Albanians are comparing the nascent Presevo insurgency to that of the K.L.A., which, despite little military capability, was strong enough to provoke a violent reaction from Mr. Milosevic's forces.
Emrush Xhemajli, leader of the National Movement of Kosovo, which supported the K.L.A. organizationally and financially, is one of the few political figures to voice unabashed support for the new liberation group.
"To date, we have announced that we support them politically and morally," he said of the guerrilla force, leaving open whether he would finance it. "It would be totally inhuman to forget them."

J. Crew vs. Banana Republic

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH 

 BODY:
I knew the presidential race had lapsed into a coma when I found myself gravitating toward Katie Couric's televised colonoscopy on the "Today" show instead of the usual chattering political heads on cable. Ms. Couric's selfless efforts on behalf of cancer prevention were not only more inspiring than the focus-group-tested nostrums prescribed by the surviving candidates, Al (Fighting for Us) Gore and George W. (Uniter Not a Divider) Bush, but also more entertaining.
Whatever happened to Americans' supposed hunger for authenticity and straight talk as an antidote to Bill Clinton? Wasn't that supposed to carry us through the whole election year? Well, as Gilda Radner's Emily Litella used to say, Never mind. 
 Eight months to go -- but hey, who's counting? -- and we're stranded with two establishment, tightly scripted, often robotic candidates who are about as different from one another as J. Crew and Banana Republic. Both are wealthy, Ivy-League-educated boomers who took safe paths through the Vietnam War, whose career advancement was greased by their dads, who advertise their intimacy with Jesus, who reek of smarmy soft money and who will do anything to win, whether it be Mr. Gore's lying about his own Congressional voting record in a debate or Mr. Bush's heartless exploitation of women's fears of breast cancer in a scurrilous attack ad.
In the true Clinton manner, both are also chameleons, ready to don new guises in a flash -- from Mr. Gore's down-home wardrobe to Mr. Bush's last-minute emergence as a champion of campaign finance reform, patients' rights and clean air. The substantive disputes between the men are, in truth, minimal in a prosperous post-cold-war era when both parties aspire to Rockefeller Republicanism (literally so in that each standard-bearer is the prince of a brand-name American dynasty). If this is going to be a campaign about issues, it may all come down to the environment, gun control, Roe v. Wade and, most of all, who's least likely to screw up the economy, stupid. Bill Clinton's low personal-approval but high job-approval ratings (still in the Reaganesque 60's) don't suggest Clinton fatigue so much as a convincing mandate for Clintonism without Clinton.
But even as we now end up where we began in yet another of our stalled political culture's recent variations on "Groundhog Day," the primary race was far from a waste of time. The John McCain crusade revealed yet again -- as the Bradley campaign might have, had there been one -- that a fast-growing minority hungers for an independent-minded political movement that shucks musty ideological litmus tests and playbooks. These voters (or if they're young, would-be voters) don't have an obvious home in either party (let alone the Reform zoo), and it's possible that many of them will sit out the election come fall. You can't blame them. In a country changing at the speed of a digital clock far faster than the analog gait of political reform, they may actually have better things to do in their own communities and lives.
This primary season also dealt another blow to the myth of media political clout. For all the swooning over Mr. McCain, he even lost New York, where his wide journalistic support included The Post, which was so distracted by his cause that for a couple of weeks it forgot to bash Hillary Clinton. People do hate the press, and in retrospect, there might have been more votes in going after TV's reporters than its evangelists. If only he had done it earlier in the campaign, Mr. McCain's on-camera tongue-lashing of the celebrity news hound Maria Shriver -- "as recognizable a personality as NBC News has," in the lukewarm description of her colleague Brian Williams -- could have won over the considerable constituency that sides with the mad-as-hell Peter Finch railing against the TV news gods in "Network."
The campaign further reaffirmed that race is still the last subject in America likely to generate straight talk, even when politicians are vying against the backdrop of Diallo and Louima verdicts, the Selma anniversary, the imminent multiracial majority in California, bitter divisions over affirmative action in Florida and new inquiries into possible racial inequities in the administration of capital punishment. Bill Bradley's earnest approach to the subject foundered on platitudes, then descended to a patronizing commercial in which Michael Jordan might as well have been shilling for cut-rate long-distance on MCI.
No Republican could find the courage, some 135 years after Appomattox, to take a stand against the Confederate flag. Mr. Bush pandered to Bob Jones University while pretending to be unaware of its racist policies; Mr. Gore pandered to Al Sharpton while pretending to be visiting his daughter. Perhaps the campaign's most shameless race demagogue was Alan Keyes, who cried racism every time he could, even saying he was a victim of a "media blackout" while hogging air time on a CNN debate. Political correctness dictated that no candidate or debate moderator could tell this egomaniacal blowhard where to get off.
Then again, the volatile Mr. Keyes had the virtue of being unpredictable. Surveying the Bush-Gore field, CBS's straight-talking Bob Schieffer spoke for the desperation of many when he remarked in language as plaintive as Samuel Beckett's: "We have got four months now until the convention. What are both these people going to do? What are we going to do as journalists?"
Larry King seemed on the verge of nodding off during an exchange between Bob Woodward and George Mitchell on Super Tuesday; a night later he was revisiting "Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?" The Drudge Report is now reduced to trafficking in speculation about Matt Drudge's own sex life, and National Journal, a normally sober Capitol Hill wonk weekly, gossips online that ABC's capsizing "This Week" may bring in Maury Povich and Connie Chung as new hosts. NBC, apparently abandoning hope for ratings gold from the real Washington, has hired Sally Quinn to write a fictional series called "Georgetown." In a pinch, though, JonBenet Ramsey will once more ride to the news biz's rescue: in only days, her bereaved parents will begin hawking their new book via Barbara Walters, Larry King, Newsweek and a full week's worth of segments on "Today."
But I for one refuse to give up on what Fox calls "You Decide 2000" just yet. True, there won't be much drama from Al Gore. He has both a united party and an effective persona: he may be the first public figure in history who has gone overnight from having the personality of a tree to that of a chainsaw mowing down anything in its path. No, the great hope for surprises in the eight months ahead is Mr. Bush, who, unlike Mr. Gore, is nowhere near the desired political center and so still must improvise to prove that he is not, as Mr. McCain branded him, a Bob Jones or Pat Robertson Republican after all.
This will be hard because Mr. Robertson is an irrepressible TV showboat; in Tuesday's election coverage he advertised his hammerlock on Mr. Bush before any camera he could find. Nor will Mr. Bush easily shake that gripping shot of his stride across the vast totalitarian carpet at Bob Jones U., now as much a visual staple of the All News repertoire as Monica Lewinsky on the rope line. Under these circumstances, it certainly won't be enough for Mr. Bush to apply the usual antidote for Republicans handcuffed to the far right -- making an "appeal to women" by pretending to be captivated by the vice-presidential aspirations of Elizabeth Dole.
And so, in his scramble to get back to "compassionate conservatism," he donned a yarmulke at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles this week (a date hastily firmed up after the Bob Jones visit, according to the center's Rabbi Marvin Hier). In San Francisco, of all cleverly chosen venues, Mr. Bush indicated that it might not be a "nightmare" to meet with uncloseted gay Republicans after all (though Richard Tafel, the American Baptist minister who heads Log Cabin, says there's still been no call). The helpful Bush cheerleaders at The Wall Street Journal are proposing further remedies, including the vain pursuit of Colin Powell as a running mate. Peggy Noonan even mused that Mr. Bush should show his affinity for Latinos by forsaking Hiltons and Four Seasons when in California to stay instead in "little hotels in the barrio."
Imagine: George W. Bush livin' la vida loca! Authenticity was never this much fun.

HEADLINE: Europe Plays Internet Catch-Up;
A Bewildering Choice of Portals, Most of Them Pricey

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL 

DATELINE: LONDON, March 10

 BODY:
After a day at work advising bank clients on their investments, Karsten Finger, a 30-year-old Berliner, likes to spend an hour or two on the Internet, looking for bargain-priced rental cars, vacations, books and CD's. But one thing that baffles him, he said, is the price of going online because Germany has such bewildering choices of rival providers. "It's impossible to see which is the best offer," said Mr. Finger, who pays about $125 a month.
Over in Paris, by contrast, Jean-Vincent Fournier, a 39-year-old Canadian script writer, logs on for maybe 40 hours a month. That used to cost him up to $200 until he switched to a cable provider that offered him unlimited access for around $65. 
 The competition to provide Internet access, he said, is "fierce."
What both of them have in common with Web users across Europe is that, not too long ago, their net-surfing was hostage to the former state monopolies like France Telecom, Deutsche Telekom and British Telecommunications, which still control most of the "local loop" -- the last stretch of phone line reaching into homes and small businesses -- despite the deregulation that opened Europe's telecommunications market to competition.
These days, as start-up service providers, cable companies and American interlopers jostle to ride the coming wave of Europe online, the behemoths of telecommunications find they must compete or lose business on the local phone charges that once provided their most profitable mainstay.
"This is the land grab that's going on for the European Internet," said Peter Bradshaw, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. "And clearly everyone is seeking to get the most consumers on their own portal. This is a war that will be decided very quickly."
What the telephone companies and other Internet service providers want, Mr. Bradshaw said, is to "grab customers now, and once they have the customers there'll be ways of taking money off those customers" through advertising, e-commerce and other businesses.
At the same time, though, European consumers -- in Britain in particular -- sense a rare victory. On Wednesday, for instance, British Telecom joined a furious price war over Internet access charges in this country. Reversing its previous hostility to anything but minute-by-minute charges for Internet use, British Telecom said it would introduce a $50-a-month flat-rate charge for unlimited telephone access to the Internet.
That came just one day after NTL, Britain's biggest cable company, said that starting April 17 it would offer free unlimited access to its customers, with a small charge for British Telecom's subscribers to take advantage of the same offer. And, one day before that, AltaVista, a unit of CMGI, said it would provide Internet access for a one-time subscription of $48 to $80 and an annual charge of $16 to $32.
One side effect was a display of the fickleness -- or at least the pace -- of the entire business. A mere 19 months ago, Freeserve seized the British market by offering what it termed free Internet access -- meaning metered telephone charges but no online charges -- and garnered 1.7 million customers to become the biggest service provider. Freeserve's shares plummeted this week as new challengers entered the fray.
But a further consequence is the proliferation of offerings. NTL, for instance, said it would provide Internet access through a portal called ntlworld to join an array of existing Web access routes ranging from AOL to Freeserve. And some analysts say the battle among service providers will not simply be fought on cost, but also on what the portals offer the subscriber by way of e-mail, e-commerce and online services.
"This is basically lowering the cost of access," said Morton Andersen, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney here. "More consumers will go online and will spend more time online. That's not just a function of cost, but also of content."
Britain is not alone either in the battle for Internet subscribers or in Europe's reluctance to simply emulate United States low-cost local phone charges. In Germany, surfers confront a bewildering choice of at least 36 price packages, ranging from $10 to $100 a month. But some are so complex -- and so misleading because of the fine print in the sign-up contracts -- that people like Mr. Finger in Berlin suspect "the companies want it that way so that you can't see what you'll be paying." Yet, Deutsche Telekom has said it will soon offer a flat-rate monthly charge for heavy Internet users for less than $50 a month.
In France, Nathan Perry, a 25-year-old American Web designer from Spokane, Wash., said the new competition had enabled him to lower the costs of his Internet use -- between two and five hours a day online for everything from checking his bank balance to videoconferencing with his family. By switching from a normal phone line to a faster line from France Telecom, he lowered his Internet connection bill to around one-third of the $250 he used to pay. Even so, he said, the system forces him to use a France Telecom portal to access AOL, which costs a further $19 a month.
Even with the new competition on price, most of Europe's telephone and online charges remain much higher than those in the United States -- a factor that Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain called a major hindrance to wider Internet use. "Our goal must be to see prices comparable with anywhere in the world, including the U.S.A.," he said Tuesday as he began a campaign to become the standard-bearer of e-commerce in Europe in advance of a European Union summit meeting in Lisbon later this month.
A study of European Internet use and access costs by the Booz Allen & Hamilton consultancy shows how expensive it is for users to go online. The average cost of 40 hours a month using the predominant Internet service in the user's country exceeds $85 in Spain, $76 in Germany, $62 in France and $49 in Britain, compared with about $37 in the United States.
Mr. Blair is not the only European politician promoting the Internet. Seeking to avert a "digital divide" between affluent people online and the offline poor, Mr. Blair said he wanted universal Internet access for Britons by 2005.
But in Germany, where the wealthiest 15 percent of the population accounts for a quarter of all Internet use, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder wants all of the nation's 40,000 schools online by next year, compared with 13,000 at present. Not surprisingly, Deutsche Telekom has offered to spend $60 million a year providing free high-speed Internet connections and the free use of its T-Online portal in those classrooms where the scholars of today will yield the customers of tomorrow.
At present, Europe's share of e-business remains minuscule. According to the Booz Allen study, all of Europe has only a 14 percent share of the world's e-commerce, compared with 70 percent in the United States. Of that, British e-commerce was valued at $1.89 billion, giving it the lead position among Europeans. German e-commerce was valued at $1.65 billion while France lagged with $1.2 billion.
European Internet use in general lags use in the United States, according to the study. While 60 percent of Americans regularly go online, and 40 percent of Scandinavians -- Europe's most-wired people -- do, most European countries belong to a "second tier" with 15 percent to 25 percent of the population regularly using the Internet.
But, as with just about any Internet business, it is the promise of the future that lures investors, start-ups, service providers and communications companies. Indeed, Mr. Bradshaw at Merrill Lynch said, the calculation among many of those offering what seem like relative bargains for Internet access is "you have to take some short-term pain" before profits kick in. "These are companies doing what they do for what they see as sound economic reasons," he said.
In Britain alone, four million new users join the Internet population every year, according to Booz Allen. But getting access to the Internet from personal computers is only part of what some of Europe's biggest businesses see as the future.
"We are behind the U.S. in terms of one-dimensional personal computer access" to the Internet, Mr. Bradshaw said. "But we are light years ahead through mobile phones." Indeed, he said, in use of wireless technology, where European countries share a common transmission standard and are developing wireless systems geared to the Internet, "Europe is obviously exploding at a much higher rate of growth than we are seeing in the U.S. at the moment."
With a potential market of 350 million in the European Union alone, that has already persuaded major players to clamber into a growing market. Vodafone AirTouch of Britain, the world's biggest wireless company, for instance, announced an alliance with Vivendi of France last January to create an Internet portal, or entrance, to the World Wide Web accessible via computers, mobile phones and cable or satellite television. Just this Thursday, British Telecom announced it would establish a separate mobile Internet business. British Sky Broadcasting, the biggest portion of which is owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, is offering interactive digital television by satellite, and cable operators are scrambling to compete.
"The idea of the Internet accessed purely through the personal computer is going to change dramatically over the next few years," Mr. Andersen at Salomon Smith Barney said.

HEADLINE: U.N. SEES VIOLATION OF A DIAMOND BAN BY ANGOLA REBELS

BYLINE: By BLAINE HARDEN 

 BODY:
An embargo ordered by the United Nations two years ago to stop Angolan rebels from using diamonds to pay for their war has been undermined by several African nations and the "extremely lax controls" of the central diamond clearing house in Antwerp, according to a report prepared for the Security Council.
The report said widespread sanctions-busting -- by, among others, three African heads of state -- has allowed diamonds to continue playing "a uniquely important role" for the Angolan rebels, whose group is known as Unita, allowing them to purchase weapons from Bulgaria while buying favors from governments in Africa. 
 The 50-page report was prepared under the direction of Robert R. Fowler, the Canadian representative to the United Nations and chairman of the Security Council committee investigating violations of sanctions on Angola. Through a spokesman, Mr. Fowler declined to comment yesterday. The report was to be presented to the Security Council next week, but when copies began to circulate, it was released to members of the council last night.
Based on a six-month investigation by a panel of nine experts, the report is especially critical of the diamond bourse in Antwerp, Belgium, which does $23 billion of business a year and processes 90 percent of the world's rough diamonds.
"The unwillingness or inability of the diamond industry, particularly in Antwerp, to police its own ranks is a matter of special concern to the panel," said the report, excerpts of which were obtained by The New York Times.
The report said Antwerp's willingness to traffic in Unita diamonds "results from the often expressed fear that stricter regulation would simply cause traders to take their business elsewhere." It also said the Belgian authorities had failed to establish a credible system for identifying rough diamonds peddled by Unita, while making "no serious effort" to keep track of diamond traders known to deal with the rebels. A prominent Antwerp diamond trader trained the diamond experts who work for Unita, the report said.
The United Nations imposed sanctions on the sale of Unita diamonds in 1998 after the rebels seized control of major diamond mines in Angola in the mid-1990's and earned billions of dollars from them. Angola's mines produce some of the finest gem-quality alluvial diamonds in the world.
During the cold war, when it was fighting against the Soviet-backed Angolan government, Unita received up to $60 million a year from the Central Intelligence Agency.
But it fell out of favor with the United States, along with the United Nations, when its leader, Jonas Savimbi, lost an internationally supervised election in Angola in 1992 and refused to accept the vote. Instead, Mr. Savimbi returned to the bush and resumed a war against the Angolan government that began before the country's independence in 1975.
Diamond money transformed Unita into a far more ferocious military organization than it had been while receiving support from either the C.I.A. or the South African government, which supported it until the end of white-minority apartheid rule.
The diamond-financed escalation of war in Angola in the last decade has cost the lives of about 500,000 people while displacing about four million others, according to human rights groups and the United Nations.
Besides buying a war machine, Mr. Savimbi used diamond money to persuade African heads of state to do him favors, according to the report.
Mr. Savimbi gave a "passport-sized" packet of diamonds to the president of the small West African country of Togo, Gnassingbe Eyadema, after the president agreed to allow Mr. Savimbi's children to live there and go to school, the report said, citing testimony from Unita's former representative in Togo.
The report also said Togo was suspected of easing the way for six shipments of arms from Bulgaria to the rebels since 1997.
The report, which relies heavily on testimony from Unita defectors, said Mr. Savimbi's closest friend among African leaders was the president of Burkina Faso, Blaise Compaore. Last year, Mr. Compaore sent Mr. Savimbi three planeloads of diesel fuel, the report said.
In return, Mr. Savimbi made "substantial contributions" to Mr. Compaore's political campaigns, the report said, adding that on at least two occasions he gave money to help the government pay its debts.
In cataloging the help that African nations have given Unita, often in exchange for diamonds, the report said that large amounts of fuel were obtained from Gabon, an oil-producing state in West Africa where Mr. Savimbi "maintained a very cordial relationship" with President Omar Bongo.
The government of Rwanda often provided Unita diamond traders with a safe haven for meeting with diamond buyers from Antwerp, as well as a refueling stop for aircraft flying weapons from Eastern Europe to rebel headquarters in the Angolan city of Andulo. Those flights ended last October when Angolan government forces took Andulo.
Bulgaria is singled out in the report as the primary supplier of Unita's weapons and spare parts. But the report played down earlier reports that Unita had purchased large numbers of tanks and heavy artillery pieces.
It said that most of the rebels' inventory of large weapons had been captured from the Angolan government and that most of its purchases in Bulgaria were of spare parts to keep the captured weapons operating.
De Beers, the South African conglomerate that controls about two-thirds of the world diamond market, escaped serious criticism in the report.
The conglomerate announced last month that it would issue written guarantees that its diamonds do not originate with African rebels. It announced last year that it would stop buying all Angolan diamonds, except those it was contractually obligated to buy from the Angolan government.
De Beers was stung in 1998 by accusations from a London-based human rights group, Global Witness, that it was helping violate United Nations sanctions by trading for Unita diamonds through its huge network of buying offices in Africa. The company's cartel-like Central Selling Organization, which in effective sets world diamond prices, is based in London, but many of its diamond traders work in Antwerp.
The company, which is owned by the Anglo-American Corporation in London, has responded to the criticism by taking steps that human rights groups have said the entire diamond industry should follow.
About a third of diamonds traded in Antwerp are purchased from traders who are not employed by De Beers and are not bound by its new rules.
The report on sanctions-busting recommends that diamond traders who violated the embargo should be barred "from any involvement in the diamond industry worldwide." It also asks that countries, including Belgium, criminally prosecute traders for violating international law.
As for African nations that have been profiting from Unita's diamond trade, the report recommends that they be subject to a three-year embargo on all arms sales. And it suggests that Bulgaria's involvement in sanctions-busting should be an obstacle to its joining NATO.
The report also called for the Security Council to create a "substantial bounty" to be paid to any institution, government or individual that tracts down Unita's assets.
Members of the panel included a diamond expert from Namibia, a small-arms expert from South Africa and an oil expert from Britain.

HEADLINE: Mrs. Clinton Tries to Link Giuliani's Policies to Bush's

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 10

 BODY:
Just three days after the Super Tuesday presidential primary, Hillary Rodham Clinton sought today to link Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, her opponent in the race for United States Senate, with the Republican Party's all-but-nominated presidential candidate, Gov. George W. Bush.
It is part of a strategy, Mrs. Clinton's aides say, to capitalize on both the strength that Vice President Al Gore, the presumed Democratic candidate, has shown in polls among New York voters and what the Clinton campaign sees as the unpopularity in New York of some of Governor Bush's positions. 
 Mrs. Clinton spent the day campaigning from central New York to the state capital, where she and the vice president shared a stage at a convention of the state's Hispanic legislators.
At two points during the day, Mrs. Clinton took pains to cast herself and Mr. Gore as offering profoundly different positions and leadership styles than Mr. Bush and Mr. Giuliani, saying the names of the two Republicans in virtually the same breath.
"If you compare the positions of the vice president and myself with Governor Bush and Mayor Giuliani, you could not have a starker comparison," Mrs. Clinton told reporters after speaking at a youth center in Cortland, N.Y., which is near Ithaca.
"Vice President Gore and I are for continuing fiscal responsibility," Mrs. Clinton continued. "Both Governor Bush and Mayor Giuliani would do a U-turn and take us back to the days of exploding deficits. Bush and Giuliani are for education vouchers, which would take money out of the public schools. Vice President Gore and I would like to support the public schools."
Mrs. Clinton was responding to questions about the results of Tuesday's New York primary, in which Mr. Bush won the Republican contest and Mr. Gore was the victor in the Democratic race.
"I'm pleased that I'm going to be in a campaign in the next eight months with a candidate who I think is going to be a great president and who has a very different view with what we need to do with America," Ms. Clinton said. "And I support that view and will be campaigning very hard for his election."
This evening, at the conference of the New York State Puerto Rican-Hispanic Task Force, Mrs. Clinton shared the stage briefly with the vice president. The two were greeted enthusiastically by the crowd of more than 500 people.
"The vice president and I stand for continuing the economic policies that have worked for America," Mrs. Clinton said.
"And George Bush and Rudy Giuliani want to do a U-turn back to the days when it didn't work for any of us, and instead go back to exploding deficits, the end of surpluses, a lack of investment in education and health care."
In Cortland, an area where Republicans often do well at the polls, Mrs. Clinton spoke at a center that sponsors programs intended to curb teenage pregnancy. After that, she traveled to Ithaca, where she greeted residents at a center for the elderly.
Later in the day, Mrs. Clinton spoke before one of the largest crowds she has faced since her campaign for the Senate began. Addressing a crowd of 5,000, Mrs. Clinton was the keynote speaker at Cornell University, for the college's Women and the New Millennium program.
But Mrs. Clinton's campaign staff was also peppered with questions about an article in The Los Angeles Times, which reported today that federal prosecutors, in internal memorandums on the campaign finance investigations stemming from the Clinton-Gore 1996 re-election campaign, criticized Mrs. Clinton for not notifying Democratic National Committee members of donations that had been illegally collected from foreign donors.
Mrs. Clinton and others had learned of the problems with funds collected by a well-known Clinton friend, Yah Lin Trie, and she and others decided to return the money that he had raised for the Clintons' legal defense fund. These accusations were made during the Senate campaign finance hearings led by Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee.
Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's spokesman, said that "this matter has been investigated with many others at great expense to taxpayers over the last several years." Mr. Wolfson added that "New Yorkers have made their judgment and know that there is nothing there."

A Walk Toward Oregon
 A Memoir.
 By Alvin M. Josephy Jr.
 Illustrated. 333 pp. New York:
 Alfred A. Knopf. $27.50. 
 On a business trip to the Midwest as a young man, Alvin M. Josephy Jr. happened to arrive at a time of dangerous flooding. In his engaging memoir, "A Walk Toward Oregon," he states matter-of-factly that he volunteered to help pile sandbags against the rising waters. He takes this diversion for granted. Josephy is an activist. More to the point, he is a liberal activist. Helping others comes naturally to him. At a very early age, he discovered who he was and what he would remain: "a reformist liberal of the optimistic F.D.R. variety" who felt "that my father's generation had bequeathed to mine a fundamentally unjust and unsound society, with whose disastrous results President Roosevelt was trying to cope, and that my generation would have to help him reform it if the America of our founding fathers was to survive."
To this end, the 84-year-old Josephy has been many things in his extraordinarily rich life: writer, advocate, soldier, politician, conservationist and civil servant. In all these roles, he has acquitted himself with honor and courage. Josephy is part of that generation, as is this reviewer, whose lives have been formed by two world wars, the Great Depression, the New Deal, the fight against fascism and the continuing struggle against racism. Whether it was the "greatest generation" is moot. It was a hard-knocks generation, and a tough one.
We believed in politics and, strange as it now seems, in government. We felt it could operate as a bulwark against poverty or oppression. Looking back, the belief seems quaint and rather touching. We took it seriously. We needed to take it seriously. All around us was suffering and despair, the sense of a system gone murderously wrong, the desperate need to find an answer, any answer, that promised relief. The government supplied that answer. It performed the necessary role of an elected government: to help the people who elected it. It is instructive to remember that the heroes of Steinbeck's "Grapes of Wrath" are not only the plucky Joad family but also the government agencies that shelter and protect them.
Josephy is best known for his work with and for American Indians (he does not call them Native Americans). He had always been interested in the West, had longed to go there since he was a child growing up comfortably in New York as a member of the Knopf publishing family on his mother's side. His heart was set on Oregon, trail's end. After dropping out of Harvard, he found a writing job at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in Hollywood in 1934. That got him to the Pacific Ocean, but not the real West.
Only after the war, on a trip for Time magazine, did Josephy begin to find what he was looking for. He had stopped at a Nez Perce reservation in Idaho, where he was told of the tribe's current problems of neglect and unemployment, the broken government promises. He was also given a lesson about the tribe's history, the proud fact that it had "once fought a war against the United States and beat four American armies." The injustice and the bravery moved him to action; he had come upon his life's work.
Since then, Josephy has written widely about Indian history and resistance, and he has lobbied and demonstrated for their cause. He was one of the few non-Indian supporters of the National Congress of American Indians, a lobbying group. He seems to have been accepted by Indians of different tribes. Undoubtedly that has been because of his advocacy, but it may also have been because of his humanistic appreciation of their inner life. He had, he explains, "learned to appreciate the depth of the full-time spirituality that permeated every aspect of their lives, made them group-oriented and cooperative, believing firmly that the well-being of the group came ahead of that of any individual." He discovered "much of comfort in them for myself."
Josephy is secure in his liberalism and not sentimental about it. Maybe the Depression cured him of sentimentality, or maybe it was his war experience. He served, he tells us, in the Pacific as a Marine combat correspondent. The difference between a Marine correspondent and an Army correspondent (which this reviewer was for Yank, the Army weekly) was that in the Army you could see action with an outfit and then leave to write about it. In the Marines, you stayed and continued to fight. It made all the difference. Josephy describes fighting through the bloody battles of Guam, Saipan and Iwo Jima, going into action with rifle and tape recorder. He received the Bronze Star.
When he finally did get to Oregon, in the mid-1950's, he found the land as receptive as he had dreamed. He bought a ranch there and pursued his writing. Along with his Indian books, he has written books about being in combat and about the Civil War in the West. He served briefly as an assistant to Stewart Udall, secretary of the interior in the Kennedy administration. In between, Josephy became an editor of American Heritage magazine and developed an interest in conservation. He was a premature environmentalist, he says, attacking the "forces of greedy growth and development for their past or present sins of spoliation, pollution and destruction."
When Vietnam came, Josephy, ever the liberal dissenter, worried that he was not doing enough against the war. By then he had moved to Greenwich, Conn., returning to his beloved Oregon only for summer vacations. But one day in Greenwich, a delegation of Indians arrived unannounced at his door. They were Lakota Sioux who had driven from South Dakota to march with the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. in a New York peace parade. The group included several medicine men, and that night they conducted a spiritual ceremony in the Josephy living room. The sound of their singing and the beating of their drums was not something ordinarily heard in Greenwich, and alarmed neighbors hurried over to make sure all was well. But the Indians had come to see their friend, and in the parade they marched in a place of honor and Josephy marched with them.
This book is about a member of a scarred generation living through a barbarous century. It is written modestly and without adornment. Occasionally, it could stand a little more adornment, a little more drama where there is now simple description. But there is drama enough in the events. Josephy has seen his time clearly; he has acted on his idealism; he has written a valuable book about a valuable life.

How We Got Here
 The 70's: The Decade That Brought You Modern Life (For Better or Worse).
 By David Frum.
 Illustrated. 418 pp. New York:
 Basic Books. $25. 
 How does one explain the growing nostalgia for mood rings, pet rocks, platform shoes, fern bars, "discomania" and other artifacts from the 1970's? Do Americans hold no grudges? Are their memories that short? From the killings at Kent State and Jackson State in 1970 through the Iranian hostage crisis and aborted rescue attempt in 1979, this decade produced one disaster after another. The oil embargo, the Watergate scandal, the resignations of Vice President Spiro Agnew and President Richard Nixon, the fall of South Vietnam, the near meltdown at Three Mile Island -- all contributed to a national mood of pessimism and unease. Divorce rates and violent crime shot upward in the 1970's, while student test scores tumbled. For the first time since the Great Depression of the 1930's, most Americans ended a decade poorer than they began it.
Leadership was in scarce supply. The images of Gerald Ford sporting his Whip Inflation Now button and Jimmy Carter battling the energy crisis in his cardigan sweater did not quite match the vision of the polio survivor Franklin D. Roosevelt assuring a hungry, frightened people in 1933 that the "only thing we have to fear is fear itself." Where Roosevelt offered hope and vision, Ford provided comic relief, most of it unintended: banging his head on a car door, tumbling down the steps of an airplane, whacking spectators on the golf course with his tee shots and insisting, among other things, that there was "no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe."
Carter, on the other hand, made a gloomy decade seem positively morose. His motto could have read: "The fun stops here." In perhaps the defining moment of the 1970's, he went on national television to complain about a crisis of the spirit, a national malaise, that had led Americans to forsake God and family for the worship of "self-indulgence and consumption." With the economy then in shambles and inflation at a record high, people were in no mood to be lectured about their moral failings. "If the Carter administration were a television show," the columnist Russell Baker observed, "it would have been canceled months ago."
David Frum agrees. As a contributing editor of The Weekly Standard and a political conservative, the author of "Dead Right," he fully appreciates the role that Carter's presidential incompetence played in Ronald Reagan's rise to national power. Yet his critique of the 1970's is oddly similar to Carter's fatuous malaise speech in that both describe a nation in turmoil, struggling with the values of its cherished past. Though Frum provides a different explanation for America's endless troubles in the 1970's, his opinions are every bit as self-righteous as Carter's -- if a lot more entertaining.
Frum is a terrific writer who deals breezily with a wide range of contemporary issues. Until the 1960's, he contends, Americans were united by a common set of beliefs. It didn't matter if someone came from the Nebraska heartland, the Kentucky coal fields or the immigrant sidewalks of New York. He or she knew that life meant struggle, sacrifice and obligation, with the rewards falling to one's children, not to oneself. This noble yet somber philosophy propelled America through the Great Depression, World War II and the 1950's -- a decade in which the nation's enormous wealth had yet to be channeled into utopian government programs to help solve all our social ills.
That came in the 1960's, Frum says, with a new generation of political leaders who "would no longer abide the restraints that had bound the sad-eyed old men who had preceded them." Young, arrogant and deeply committed to expanding the liberal vision of social justice, these leaders "believed in the limitless potential of their societies, their governments and themselves." As Frum sees it, this vision produced impossible hopes and shattering disappointments. The failure to end poverty and discrimination angered many blacks, while the increase in crime and welfare rolls disillusioned many whites. At the same time, the expanding war in Vietnam served to glamorize protesters who often broke the law. A downward spiral began, marked by racial violence, uncivil behavior and destructive radical movements. Frum has no trouble assigning the blame. "The old men of the 1950's earned trust; the young men of the 60's squandered it."
There is little evidence in this book to support such grand generalizations. Frum simply spins his web with a confidence that ignores contradiction and rival opinion. Who, for example, are the "young men of the 1960's" who "squandered" America's trust? Frum doesn't say, but the true villains in his saga come mostly from the "sad-eyed" older generation: President Lyndon Johnson, who force-fed America the failed Great Society; Chief Justice Earl Warren, who struck down public school segregation, Frum says, with dangerous logic and "very flimsy legal justification"; and Associate Justice William Brennan, a "kindly, unscrupulous man" who supposedly turned the court system into a playground for every loser with a grievance against society.
Never one for understatement, Frum insists that the bewildering pace of social and cultural change in the 1960's created a revolution in beliefs and habits that turned a conformist, obedient, puritanical, self-confident people into a permissive, emotional, hedonistic, guilt-ridden mob. He can even date this transformation to "sometime after 1969." It is true, of course, that America paid a price for the excesses of the 60's, and that much of the bill came due in a hurry. While Frum is far too glib in analyzing those excesses, he is a master at describing their effects on the 1970's -the decade," he says, "that brought you modern life." And what comes through powerfully is the obsession with personal freedom that replaced the more collective ethos of the past.
Americans now reveled in self-improvement, self-expression, self-indulgence and self-gratification. A new work ethic emerged, preaching "identity" and "fulfillment." Well-paid employees, mostly young, chafed at the rigor and monotony of their jobs.
Self-help books explained things like "your erroneous zones" and "how to be your own best friend." Jogging and exercise became essential parts of middle-class life. Good mental health now required excruciating public confessions. Betty Ford admitted to drug and alcohol addiction, while Phil Donahue insisted that all neuroses receive an hour of national attention. A whole language of psychobabble was created, urging people to "find your own space" and "do your own thing." By the 1970's, Frum notes, "every Buick owner in the country understood how very dangerous it was to keep his feelings bottled up."
Long-term commitments went out of style. Marriage rates dropped. Fewer babies were born; having children in the 1970's seemed more like a burden than a blessing. It took a hundred episodes before Mike and Gloria became parents in "All in the Family." Other successful sitcoms -- The Mary Tyler Moore Show," "The Jeffersons," "Rhoda," "Three's Company," "The Bob Newhart Show" -- featured no children at all. Never before, Frum says, were Americans so keenly focused on their own happiness, their own desires. What they overlooked was "the self-discipline needed to make that freedom a blessing rather than a curse."
Frum sees the 1970's as bringing "the most total social transformation" to America "since the coming of industrialism." While few historians would endorse such puffery, there is much about this decade that changed American life. For a conservative like Frum, the positive legacy of the 1970's can be seen in the decline of labor unions, the deregulation of industry and the recent emphasis on family values. He believes that the 70's made America more competitive, expressive and dynamic on the one hand; less literate, deferential and united on the other. "How We Got Here" may not map out the cultural path to the year 2000 in perfect sequence but, frankly, who cares? It's a quirky, irreverent book, and great fun to read.

FRANCIE
 By Karen English.
 Farrar, Straus & Giroux, $16.
(Ages 10 and up) 
 Set sometime during the Truman administration, this portrait of a 12-year-old black girl in Alabama is a model of economy. Karen English compresses worlds of feeling and experience into every sequence of her first novel, offering readers not just a good diversion but an opportunity to try on someone else's skin.
"I did something to that cat, I admit it," are Francie's opening words. "But that cat did something to me first." The cat has tried to draw blood from Francie, and he's not the only one. In short order, readers learn that Francie and her terse, stern mother do the laundry every weekend at Miss Beach's Boarding House for Colored, and that Miss Beach, the cat's owner, predicts that Francie's father, who has been working up north for more than a year, will never get around to sending for his family. In town, white children successfully blame Francie for their own shoplifting, even though her defense is ironclad. Small injustices lay the foundation for a tense plot line, involving a fugitive teenage boy unjustly accused of attempted murder. Francie wants to help him, but the risks are high. "Why not give them men an invitation to get mad at all the coloreds and burn us out just to make their point? Why not just put up a sign?" snaps her aunt when she learns that Francie has left the boy homemade canned goods, labeled with her mother's name.
However suspenseful the plot, the scene-setting rivals it for impact. On her first school-day trip to town, Francie matter-of-factly comments, "I had to step off the curb for children who barely noticed me," then describes a store display. Every nuance, from a neighbor's sniping about a newborn's hair ("It's gonna be kinky") to Francie's offhand remark -- and she's an honor student -- that she's never "really" been in a library, implies vast hurdles as well as the determination to topple them. Where many current children's books about the pre-civil-rights South wax nostalgic about the warmth of black communities or dramatize the inequities, this novel seems, simply, to tell the truth.

HEADLINE: Conversations With Sondheim

BYLINE: By Frank Rich; Frank Rich was the chief drama critic of The Times from 1980 to1993. He is now an Op-Ed columnist and senior writer for the magazine.

 BODY:
In the old rehearsal snapshots from 1957, three of the four men who created "West Side Story" look as cool as the Jets and Sharks. The choreographer Jerome Robbins, the playwright Arthur Laurents and the composer Leonard Bernstein are all dressed in 50's hip. Only the true kid of the group, the 27-year-old lyricist making his Broadway debut, seems out of place. Stephen Sondheim is in a tie and a loud, boxy sports jacket, his hair slicked back, his grin forced -- a geek trying to cut it with the popular crowd.
Yet the appearance is deceiving. Perhaps even more than his collaborators, he was a rebel advancing a cause: a new, jarring, adult kind of Broadway musical. Like most Sondheim efforts to come -- among them the landmark shows "Company," "Follies," "Sweeney Todd" and "Sunday in the Park With George" -- West Side Story" wasn't the smash commercial hit of its season. It lost the Tony Award to "The Music Man." But it also upended the genteel conventions of an American art form then exemplified by "My Fair Lady." The future's possibilities seemed boundless, for both the musical theater and the four young artists retooling it. 
 Now that future has come -- and gone. Bernstein and Robbins are dead, having deserted Broadway long before their passing. Laurents is still a busy playwright at 82, but musicals aren't high on his agenda. That leaves Sondheim, who turns 70 on March 22. So obscure in 1957 that he wasn't even mentioned in The Times review of "West Side Story," he is now the greatest and perhaps best-known artist in the American musical theater. But that is a somewhat empty distinction. Sondheim may be the last major creator of Broadway musicals, period, still actively devoted to the trade. He may have even outlived the genre itself, which was long ago exiled by rock music from center stage to niche status in American culture and is now barely a going concern.
Sondheim doesn't dispute that he is a dinosaur. "It's discouraging," he says, as he lists his vanished contemporaries and concludes that "only John and Freddie" -- Kander and Ebb, the songwriters of "Cabaret" and "Chicago" -- remain as active in musical theater as he is. Nor is the Broadway of 2000 the one of his youthful dreams. For nearly two decades, the Winter Garden, where "West Side Story" jump-started his career, has been monopolized by "Cats."
"You have two kinds of shows on Broadway -- revivals and the same kind of musicals over and over again, all spectacles," says Sondheim. "You get your tickets for 'The Lion King' a year in advance, and essentially a family comes as if to a picnic, and they pass on to their children the idea that that's what the theater is -- a spectacular musical you see once a year, a stage version of a movie. It has nothing to do with theater at all. It has to do with seeing what is familiar. We live in a recycled culture."
Using his imminent birthday as an excuse, Sondheim and I are meeting for a series of conversations to take stock of his life, his career, the theater. He suggests we convene in the Turtle Bay town house he has lived in since 1960 but which he spent two years rebuilding after a devastating 1995 fire. Sondheim's arm was in a sling after a fall in London, and as he puts it: "I'm not particularly upbeat these days. The last year has not been good." A revue of his songs, "Putting It Together," was closing after only three months on Broadway. The recent Off Broadway workshop of his new musical, "Wise Guys," a project that he feels has consumed too much of the past decade, went awry and was, he says, "a waste of time."
I first met Sondheim just as his reputation was starting to skyrocket -- when he was 41 and I was 21 -- after he wrote me a letter about my college newspaper review of the Boston tryout of "Follies." He was the first professional writer to give me the courage to believe I might be one too. Long before that, he played a role in shaping my lifelong passion for theater, for "Gypsy" and "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" were formative events in my theatergoing childhood. "If Mama Was Married," a song from "Gypsy," was the first song I'd ever heard about being a child of divorce, which I had recently become, and it pointed me toward Sondheim before I knew his name.
Our initial real-life encounter led to a spotty acquaintanceship that was over well before my 14 seasons of reviewing theater for The Times, during which I had no contact with him at all. In those years, ending in 1993, my adoration of "Sunday in the Park" was offset by my unenthusiastic reviews of Sondheim's saddest Broadway failure, "Merrily We Roll Along," and one of his rare crowd-pleasers, "Into the Woods." When a book of my criticism was published after we had re-established contact, he told me, "I'd forgotten how rough you'd been about my shows." But he didn't seem cross about it; by this point, we shared too much else, including our alarm that Broadway was turning into a theme park. Sondheim thinks I was right to end my full-time engagement with the theater just before the Disney deluge, yet he hasn't moved on and never would. The man who wrote "I'm Still Here" may despair over Broadway, but it would never occur to him to leave it.
These days, the expansive, very "done" downstairs of Sondheim's house glitters more opulently than it did when I first saw it in the 70's, though the principal decoration is still antique games, now displayed in glass cases. The place feels so hermetically sealed that you would never know you were in midtown Manhattan. In another New York, the legendary editor Maxwell Perkins lived here. Until infirmity sent her to Connecticut, Katharine Hepburn was the next-door neighbor.
A cook bustles in the kitchen, popping in frequently to refill our glasses. Sondheim says he has always had "a large capacity for alcohol," and I don't dispute it. Our two major conversations run some five unflagging hours each, one over dinner, another sprawling through a lazy late-winter Saturday afternoon. Through it all, he seems as robust as ever, as boyish as when I first met him and not nearly as testy. But that could be a trick of time. I'm now almost a decade older than Sondheim was when we first met.
Now, as then, he is always careful to cloak emotions, as opposed to strong opinions, in the unsparing intelligence that might have led him to his second choice of career, research mathematics. ("I would have loved to work on Fermat's theorem.") He tries to be clinically objective about every subject. Sometimes he even seems to be standing outside looking at himself as an equation to be cracked.
His merciless powers of dissection extend to his own work. Quoting a lyric from "Tonight" -- The world was just an address" -- he cheerfully adds, "That's fine, if you like purple writing." He still cherishes the memory of a man walking out of "West Side Story" on its second night. "He wanted a musical -- meaning a place to relax before he has to go home and face his terrible dysfunctional family. Instead of which he got a lot of ballet dancers in color-coordinated sneakers snapping their fingers and pretending to be tough." Sondheim sympathizes with the guy rejecting his work: "His expectations had been defeated!"
Though he has outlived not only the traditional Broadway of his childhood but also the new, more urbane Broadway he ushered in for my generation, his tone is more regretful than angry. Even when at his most down or acerbic, his voice can abruptly jump a decibel level to express childlike enthusiasm for a movie ("Henry Fool") or a fellow composer ("Steve Reich is a personal hero to me") or a play (Charles Busch's "Tale of the Allergist's Wife" may be "the funniest evening I've ever had in the theater").
The only time he cut me off was when I began a question with the phrase, "When you grew up. . . ."
"I never grew up," he interjected, with a finality that foreclosed any follow-up.
This may explain how Sondheim has remained an artist and why, for all his sophistication, he can seem guileless, even nave. Over tea, dinner, nightcaps, he answered any question, whether speaking unsentimentally of the "very unpleasant, paranoid, suspicious" Robbins ("I can't even say that I miss Jerry -- I miss Jerry's impact on shows") or of other Broadway songwriters or his often-solitary personal life. He rarely went off the record.
At the time of our meetings, he was also, despite his recent setbacks, surprisingly sunny (for him) about the future. He was eager to revamp "Wise Guys" promptly for Broadway (its title, too, will change) with his collaborator, the playwright John Weidman. Hal Prince, Sondheim's key creative partner until they split after the 1981 debacle of "Merrily," is taking over the show's direction from the departed Sam Mendes. And though Sondheim doesn't think 70 is a big deal -- I don't want to spend the next six months being iconized" -- some special events this spring tickle him. In May, the New York Philharmonic will stage a three-nights-only concert performance of "Sweeney Todd" starring Bryn Terfel and Patti LuPone; he is pleased that Terfel is a "Sweeney" acolyte, though with typical sorry-grateful ambivalence he is also relieved that LuPone will stand up for its Broadway pedigree. The Museum of Television and Radio is saluting Sondheim for three months on both coasts, even unearthing kinescopes of TV scripts he wrote in the 50's. In Washington, a Library of Congress concert will include his 1974 adaptation of Aristophanes' "Frogs" as well as non-Sondheim material -- songs culled from a cheeky, revelatory list Sondheim drew up with the title "Songs I Wish I'd Written (At Least in Part)." (See above.)
Sondheim has also taken heart from the New York premiere, at Off Broadway's Second Stage, of his novice professional effort, "Saturday Night," written before "West Side Story" and abandoned when its producer died. The show had been consigned to a trunk for nearly half a century, though the experience of writing it, and of its young author's first efforts to break into the theater, were at the core of "Merrily."
"I don't have any emotional reaction to 'Saturday Night' at all -- except fondness," Sondheim says. "It's not bad stuff for a 23-year-old. There are some things that embarrass me so much in the lyrics -- the missed accents, the obvious jokes. But I decided, Leave it. It's my baby pictures. You don't touch up a baby picture -- you're a baby!"
the first glimpse of Sondheim as a Broadway baby predates even "Saturday Night." It's the famous photo of him as a teenager folded uneasily into the Oscar Hammerstein II family. Hammerstein was an acquaintance of Sondheim's divorced fashion-industry parents, and he treated their stage-struck boy as a surrogate son, becoming his mentor. Though Sondheim famously despised his mother, Janet Fox (Foxy) Sondheim, whose funeral in 1992 he didn't bother to attend, his affection and reverence for Hammerstein, who died in 1960, are never far from the surface. The man who wrote "Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin"' and "My Favorite Things" bequeathed a lifelong calling and ethos to the protege who would seem to affront Hammerstein's cockeyed optimism with the gimlet-eyed pessimism of songs like "The Ladies Who Lunch" and "Losing My Mind."
Sondheim lights up when I ask him if he remembers the first opening night he ever attended, because it is a show Hammerstein wrote with Richard Rodgers: "New Haven! 'Carousel'! It was a seminal experience of my life. I was completely overwhelmed." Sondheim and Hammerstein's son Jamie, both turning 15, were taken as a double-birthday treat to the pre-Broadway premiere. The first song from the show that Sondheim mentions is not "If I Loved You" or "June Is Bustin' Out All Over," but the sorrowful "What's the Use of Wond'rin'," in which the heroine rendingly predicts that the ending of her love affair "will be sad." And the first character he recalls is not among its leads, but the hoodlum villain, a misfit and outcast named Jigger. "I remember how everyone goes off to the clambake at the end of Act One and Jigger just follows, and he was the only one walking on stage as the curtain came down. I was sobbing." The teenage Steve hugged Hammerstein's wife, Dorothy. "She had a specific fur stole that she wore to every opening of Oscar's for good luck, and I cried so heavily I stained it."
But when I try to coax Sondheim into parsing his strong reaction to "Carousel," he gives a characteristic hide-and-seek answer in which any emotional bloodletting is instantly stanched by an intellectual rationale. "Musically, it's my favorite score second to 'Porgy and Bess.' Maybe it's because it's about a loner who's misunderstood -- that's psychobabble. I don't know. Also it's about the restlessness of the father and what we inherit from our parents -- but again, that's psychobabble. What is that quality? It's yearning. Its music is so rich. Those songs are so full of feeling. It's Rodgers absolutely at his flowering best."
And Hammerstein? Though Sondheim has only praise for "Carousel," his overall appraisal of his father figure is more nuanced: "Oscar's lyrics are often flat-out sentimental, lacking in irony, which is the favorite mode of expression of the latter part of the 20th century. And I happen to love irony. He had a limited range of imagery -- too many birds in his lyrics -- stuff that is metaphorically what we all feel, but because they've been overused so much, and often by him, they lack force.
"What few people understand is that Oscar's big contribution to the theater was as a theoretician, as a Peter Brook, as an innovator. People don't understand how experimental 'Show Boat' and 'Oklahoma!' felt at the time they were done. Oscar is not about the 'lark that is learning to pray' -- that's easy to make fun of. He's about 'Allegro."'
When Sondheim was 17, he was hired as a gofer on "Allegro," the R&H musical between "Carousel" and "South Pacific." It was an experimental show, now rarely remembered or revived, about an idealistic doctor who gets distracted by success. "It's really about Oscar," Sondheim says, "who as a result of 'Oklahoma!' and 'Carousel' became very much in demand as a flag bearer for good causes." But what Sondheim most cherishes are the show's "Our Town"-style theatrical innovations, its Greek chorus and cinematic scene transitions.
Though the devices of "Allegro" were novel for big Broadway musicals then, they are puny next to Sondheim's subsequent breakthroughs. His own shows have told stories in reverse chronology, with flash-forwards and flashbacks, through dreams and nightmares, even in the stylized ritual (and drag) of classic Japanese theater. While Hammerstein introduced issues like miscegenation to the musical theater, Sondheim has annexed more complex subjects and dramatized them less preachily: political assassination, cultural imperialism, mass murder, the creation of art, the fear of intimacy and the terror of death. Along the way he has produced an incomparably diverse song catalog that embraces uncomplicated show-biz pizzazz ("Comedy Tonight"), the quintessential nocturnal cabaret turn ("Send In the Clowns") and a poetic meditation on history ("Someone in a Tree") -- songs that have attracted interpreters from Sinatra to Madonna.
For Sondheim, the daring of his career all goes back to that summer of '47. "Allegro' had a very, very big effect on me," he says. When the show was briefly unearthed in concert form by the City Center Encores series in 1994, he appeared on stage to introduce it. "And I thought, Oh, God, it's so navely written. What Hammerstein reveals in 'Allegro' is huge vision and a limited amount of technical ability to carry it out." His voice suddenly revs up: "Except that the total vision is huge and imaginative and exploratory and opens new paths for everybody!"
When Sondheim was working on "Allegro," he was mainly interested in "boasting to friends I was Oscar's gofer" and spreading backstage gossip. ("Hello, Mary, you can't believe what happened today: Agnes de Mille screamed at --") But he was struck as well by the disappointed reaction to the show on Broadway, where it lasted only a season. "It was baffling to most people and pretentious," Sondheim says. "These are all adjectives that came to haunt me in my own, as we say, career: pretentious and incoherent and unfeeling and whatever."
He adds: "Somebody said to me once, 'Your whole life has been fixing "Allegro."' That's what I've been doing. I've been trying to fix 'Allegro' all my life."
It was around the time of "South Pacific," two years later, that Sondheim met Hal Prince, who, in 1957, would be a producer of "West Side Story."
"Often I'd say with Hal, we got in just under the wire," Sondheim says. "We were able to enjoy the so-called fruits of our labors in a field that we genuinely loved. We'd go down the street and see somebody else's show and know that we were all talking the same language." Rock 'n' roll was exploding then, but Sondheim says: "Rock didn't affect me because the overlap was when shows were still popular so I could afford to ignore it. It was not part of my generation; it was the generation 10 years under me. To be 24 in 1954 as opposed to being in your teens is all the difference. I knew where I was and what I wanted to do. And through the 50's and 60's, the kind of shows I liked were still viable: those that developed stories through song in which the songs had individual voices. There was enough success going around, and so you were encouraged to do more."
It was in the 80's that Sondheim could no longer ignore the reality that rock, rising costs and what he sees as "dumbing down" were endangering his Broadway. "The source of what was popular in music had shifted from movies and shows to records," and even the number of musicians in Broadway pit bands had been downsized by half. "What's happened to the theater," he says, "is one thing that does depress me a lot because it is such a large part of my life. You'd go and see other shows that would stimulate you, that would make you want to write. Now it makes you not want to write because you think the audience isn't there anymore. The audience that is there is not an audience who would either like or respond to the kind of stuff I write except with, if anything, kind of detached bemusement instead of getting involved."
The Broadway community has fled, too. "There's none whatsoever. The writers write one show every two or three years. Who congregates at Sardi's? What is there to congregate about? Shows just sit in theaters and last."
We commiserated about the latest Broadway calamity -- the eviction of the nonmusical play. The theater district used to be ablaze with musicals, dramas, star vehicles and fluffy comedies all side by side. At one point this season, there wasn't a single recently written comedy or drama running on Broadway -- a grim historic first. "When was the last time you saw a straight play when you couldn't wait to get on the phone and tell your friends?" Sondheim asks rhetorically -- then gives an excited answer to his own question, sounding like a boy still infatuated with the theater after all: "How I Learned to Drive.' I saw it with Arthur Laurents. I loved it! We danced out of there. I got on the phone -- we couldn't wait to see something else on the stage -- anything!"
But "How I Learned to Drive" was produced off Broadway, not on, and three years ago.
Not that Sondheim is romantic about Broadway's past. He sees it too lucidly. I invite him to play critic and offer his candid views of a list of icons who came before him.
Jerome Kern: "It's been received wisdom for so many years that Kern is a songwriter's songwriter. But the Princess Theater musicals! Ninety percent of it is pitti, pitti, pitti -- vamps -- and those very wordy Wodehouse lyrics. A lot of that stuff is no good at all. On the other hand, you listen to 'They Didn't Believe Me' and you never want to write a song again."
Irving Berlin: "Berlin never got to me because he's like a very good character actor. He sinks into a style that's just kind of a general kind of American style. I wouldn't know an Irving Berlin song from other popular songs of the 20's and 30's written by Harry Warren. What distinguishes Berlin is the brilliance of his lyrics. 'You Can't Get a Man With a Gun' -- that's as good a comic song as has ever been written by anybody. You look at the jokes and how quickly they're told, and it still has a plot to it. It's sophisticated and very underrated. When Hammerstein slops over, as in that 'lark that is learning to pray,' you giggle. Berlin never goes that far. On the other hand, I don't think Berlin has ever touched me the way 'What's the Use of Wond'rin" has touched me. I will admire Berlin more than love him."
Richard Rodgers's pre-Hammerstein collaboration with Lorenz Hart: "I find that they write the same song over and over again in different categories. There's the ironic love song, and then there's -- the ironic love song. My objection to Hart is entirely on the matter of his technique, which is sloppy. The way the words are mis-accented: 'I know a movie executive who's twice as bright.' It was Oscar who used to defend Larry Hart. He'd say you don't understand what he did for lyric writers in America. He freed us up with his use of vernacular -- the way people converse in real life as opposed to Otto Harbach and the formalized lyric, the syntax that's reversed. What Oscar was telling me was, Don't just look at the details that can be faulted -- look at what he's saying rather than how he's saying it. I'm someone who's always been seduced by style over substance. That's a little unfair to myself; I'm also seduced by substance. But style is very important to me, and therefore technique is. So when I see a guy with lazy technique who is capable of better, I get angry. Because I see other people like Frank Loesser and Dorothy Fields who are dealing with the same vernacular and their technique is virtually perfect. They work harder."
Harold Arlen: "There are ineffable qualities like the kind of yearning, and sort of sadness, even in the joyful songs. I respond emotionally as well as intellectually. I knew him slightly. I was invited to a supper party in the days of 'Saturday Night.' I'd come prepared with three songs in case anybody asked me to sit down at the piano. And so finally somebody said that we have a promising young composer here, and I got up and blushed prettily and went over to the piano and sang the title number and then 'This Is Nice Isn't It?' and 'One Wonderful Day,' which is a 2-4 with a rousing climax. So I got terrific response, right? I sat down next to Harold Arlen, blushing with pride, and he turned to me and not in any way bitchily or meanly said, 'You mustn't be afraid not to write a blockbuster,' because what I had done was wham, wham, wham. And then you think of Arlen songs like 'Sleepin' Bee' that just are beautiful and charming and are not meant to bring the house down. Of course, when you're 24 years old you want to bring the house down. But it was a lesson I learned, not to always try to write a blockbuster. It's a story I told Michael Bennett when we were doing 'Follies,' because you know his tendency was to want every single number to stop the show. I said, Give them a break every now and then."
Ira Gershwin: "He is less lazy technically than Larry Hart but much more self-conscious. It's rare in an Ira Gershwin lyric where you don't feel the sweat because he's shoving so many rhymes in. The fact is that all the really great lyrics in 'Porgy and Bess' are written by DuBose Heyward."
Would Sondheim critique Sondheim? "Verbosity is the thing I have to fight most in the lyric department. One reason I admire Oscar is that he's the least verbose, if sometimes plain to the point of being uninteresting. 'Less is more' is a lesson learned with difficulty. As you get older, you pay more attention to it -- that's why composers end up writing string quartets. Once a line becomes poetry, it's not a lyric. Reduction releases power. E.B. White may be my favorite American writer because of that." As for his own music, Sondheim says: "I'm accused so often of not having melodic gifts, but I like the music I write. Harmony gives music its life, its emotional color, more than rhythm."
Among the composers Sondheim most admires is, fittingly, George Gershwin, who also spanned the gamut from Tin Pan Alley to "serious" musical theater. Sondheim describes a pilgrimage to look at the original manuscript of "Porgy and Bess" at the Library of Congress, his voice rising as he speaks. "I was trembling. You can see how Gershwin wrote the trio by looking at the music paper. He starts off, and it's fully harmonized and he's got the melody -- Bess, where's my Bess?' Then an idea takes control of him, and he can't prevent himself from going ahead with the melody and he leaves the harmony blank, and every now and then he'll put in a chord just to remind himself that at this point I'll get to the C minor chord, and then he goes on and you see a song take him over. It's thrilling!"
Sondheim is too young to have met Gershwin, but vividly remembers meeting Cole Porter in the late 50's, near the bitter end for Porter, whose leg had recently been amputated. "Gypsy" was in preparation, and Ethel Merman corralled Sondheim and Jule Styne to pay a cheer-up visit to Porter's apartment at the Waldorf Towers and play some songs. "Cole was very depressed," Sondheim says. "He was carried in like a sack of potatoes by a burly manservant. But he couldn't have been more charming. On that line in 'Together' -- No fits, no fights, no feuds and no egos, amigos' -- he chortled, and I knew I got him. He didn't see the last rhyme coming. It was a real Cole Porter rhyme -- he inserts foreign words into lyrics -- an homage to Cole Porter without meaning to be. He got such a moan of pleasure, it was absolutely sexual. It was great! It was a great moment!"
I could listen to these stories all night, so I prod Sondheim to dish Merman, the star whose career was bookended by Porter's "Anything Goes" in the 30's and "Gypsy" a quarter-century later. He doesn't demur: "I've made a joke that is both glib and I suppose slightly tasteless about her being an illustration of the old anecdote that it isn't remarkable that the dog lost playing chess -- it's the fact that the dog plays chess. What was remarkable was watching a woman who everybody assumed couldn't act, act. Now, it's a limited kind of acting. She didn't quite understand what 'Rose's Turn' was about."
In a key moment in that legendary "Gypsy" finale, a musicalized nervous breakdown, Rose is supposed to stutter over the word "mama" to indicate "you were seeing a mind crack" -- a device Sondheim says he stole from Jessica Tandy's Blanche DuBois in the last scene of "A Streetcar Named Desire." But as he tells it, no matter how elaborately Merman was invited to ride the moment emotionally, she had only one question about the stutter: "Does it come in on the downbeat?" Speaking of the 1974 Broadway revival with Angela Lansbury, Sondheim says: "That's the kind of moment Angie understands exactly. Ethel never did."
We can't let Merman go: "She performed the hell out of the show when the critics were there. Or if she thought there was a celebrity in the audience. So we used to spread a rumor that Frank Sinatra was out front. That whoever, Judy Garland was out front." Josh Logan, who had directed Merman in "Annie Get Your Gun," warned Sondheim that Merman could become mechanical, but "I was smug enough to think, Well, 'Gypsy,' compared to 'Annie,' is one of the great roles, it's great literature, blah blah blah blah. And of course she did exactly to us what she'd done to 'Annie.'
"I'll tell you one thing she did do, she steadily upstaged everybody. Every night, she would be about one more foot upstage, so finally they were all playing with their backs to the audience. I don't think it was conscious. Ethel was not big on brains. But she sure knew her way around a stage, and it was all instinctive."
Sondheim thinks "stars are great" for the theater, but doesn't believe the theater has any stars now except itinerant visitors from movies and TV. Bernadette Peters comes closest, he says, but when "she does a show that's a hit like 'Annie Get Your Gun,' she has to stay with it for two years. In the old days, Bernadette would have done at least as many shows as Merman, a couple of dozen. She's done maybe 10 shows."
Sondheim's own favorite star performances in musicals, his or others? Among male performances, he unequivocally cites two: Alfred Drake in "Kismet" and John McMartin in "Follies." The list of women is longer, including Peters in "Sunday in the Park," Lansbury in "Sweeney Todd" and "obviously, Ethel was thrilling in 'Gypsy."'
"So what can you do on a Saturday night -- alone?"
That lyric, sung by lonely young men in Brooklyn desperate for romance, is at the top of "Saturday Night." For those of us who don't find Sondheim's songs pretentious and unfeeling, it encapsulates the deeply felt Sondheim signature emotion in its fetal form: the aching, ambivalent and often thwarted desire to connect with someone. It's the naked yearning that runs through "With So Little to Be Sure Of," "Too Many Mornings," "Being Alive," "Pretty Women," "Not a Day Goes By," "Finishing the Hat."
Like everyone else, I want to know what of the offstage Sondheim is in these songs. Is there some of him in Bobby, the perennial bachelor in "Company"? Or in Georges Seurat of "Sunday in the Park," who would rather trance out and paint than be with his lover? Or even in the murderous Sweeney, whose yearning for lost love metastasizes into rage?
Sondheim balks, of course. With rapid-fire erudition, he soliloquizes on how "the outsider is basic to a lot of dramatic literature. This country's about conformity. And so nonconformity is a fairly common theme, and it's obviously something I feel, belonging to a number of minorities."
Well, in his case, does being gay play a part in it?
"Homosexuality, certainly it's a part of it. But the outsider feeling -- somebody who people want to both kiss and kill -- occurred quite early in my life. I was an only child. I was the youngest and got the best marks in the class -- I won't say the smartest. Right away that means some people love you and some people hate you.
"But my memory of my childhood is very happy, and I spent most of my life in school anyway, because my parents were both working parents. And so I had a very good time. And for the most part, teachers liked me a lot. And older students liked me a lot. But I was aware that I was different.
"The kind of writing that I do in the musical theater, for which I'm both praised and condemned, has to do with its individuality, I think. It has to do with the fact that it's not like others. I started to become aware of it with 'Company,' which is where I first got to start my own voice loud and clear. And the anger and condemnation and snottiness and sneering that I got with 'Company' quite startled me. Because I'd been dismissed before, which is not the same thing.
"When you make somebody hate you without intending to make them hate you, it's a different feeling."
But Sondheim instantly adds that he doesn't mind "because it's so much better to be disliked than ignored." I have no doubt he means it. Perhaps the show of his that aroused the fiercest hostility, "Anyone Can Whistle," which folded in a week in 1964, introduces an evil Mayoress played by Lansbury with the lyric "Everybody hates me, yes, yes" -- and it's a jazzy, finger-snapping, Kay Thompson kind of number.
Was the rap on "Company" in 1970 -- some found it "anti-marriage" -- in part a coded antagonism to the possibility that the show's creators covertly intended Bobby to be gay?
"That's not what we intended. And if that's what we unconsciously meant, then that's what we unconsciously meant. We were talking about somebody unable to make an emotional connection. Period. It's about how difficult it is to live with somebody. And there are millions of men around who are Bobbies, who just will not make an emotional commitment to a woman. What is all this that it's got to be gay? There's the myth that one of the problems of homosexuality is that people can't commit. There are plenty of homosexuals who are committed emotionally to others. And there are plenty who are not."
Sondheim lived alone until he was 61, when he met Peter Jones, a young songwriter. His long solitary spell, he says, didn't faze him. "God knows I spent enough hours on the psychiatrist's couch discussing it, but it's partly what you're used to as a kid. I grew up entirely, as one friend puts it, as an 'institutionalized child' in that I was brought up either by a cook, a nanny or a boarding school or camp." He thinks of himself as never having had parents, "so I never had any role models of what it was like to have a family feeling. I was not miserable; at least I didn't think I was, so I didn't miss it.
"I remember when I went to Williams I wanted very much to be in a fraternity" -- he joined Beta Theta Pi -- and so I guess there was a part of me that wanted to be 'accepted.' I was very lucky now that I look back on it, that the first theater experience I had was 'Allegro,' a completely maverick show. And the first show that I wrote that got produced was 'West Side Story,' a completely maverick show. I think that confirmed me in, O.K., you're going to be a maverick. So I was able to build on it instead of retrenching and going back to join another fraternity.
"Something I only realized in my adult life is that one of the reasons I love writing musicals is that musicals are collaborations. I love the family feeling. I don't think I could ever write a play, because I'd be too lonely." The two major nonmusical scripts he has written, a thriller for the movies ("The Last of Sheila") and another for the stage ("Getting Away With Murder"), were both done with writing partners.
"Because I had a lot of friends in my 20's and 30's," he continues, "I didn't feel alone. I liked working, which you do in a room by yourself. I wasn't missing anything. I really wasn't. I had so-called relationships, just not very intense or none that I wanted to make a sort of permanent daily relationship. Not unlike Bobby. I'm sure one of the reasons I had no trouble writing for him was I understood what that emotional, not so much disconnection or dysfunction, but aloofness, or reserve, was. Or perhaps fear. I don't know. At any rate, it actually never really occurred to me to live with anybody. It just didn't occur to me until it happened by accident, when I met Peter Jones and we got together."
Sondheim is now living alone again, though he and Jones are "still close and seeing each other." His daily routine is fairly regimented: work into the evening, exercise and a late dinner. He's not a habitue of the New York show-biz party-and-premiere circuit. "I like writing, and because I don't have a family, I don't have an awful lot else in my life."
Among the things not in his life -- eccentrically enough for one of the country's premier wordsmiths -- is books. He has rarely read any since college. "I didn't enjoy a lot of them. I get very upset by just tiny glitches in prose style, and I get impatient. I can't get into it easily. And then when I do, I'm a very slow reader." If he's hungry for aesthetic thrills, he seeks them at BAM and in London; he's been a devotee of experimental troupes like Theatre de Complicite and Cheek by Jowl. While Sondheim tries to keep up with contemporary opera and once flirted with a collaboration with Robert Wilson, he is no fan of ballet or operagoing. And though friends may call his attention to a hip-hop cut or two, he says: "I can never be as interested in pop music as pop music fans are, because to me music is about harmony, and in most pop music, the harmony is not interesting because that's not what it's about. It's about rhythm and performance and visceral reaction and participation and dancing." Sondheim is "behind" on the Internet. He watches little TV and doesn't do e-mail, activities he sees as drains on his work time. His famous fascination with games has waned; he'll look at cryptic crosswords "to figure out the gimmick" but not bother to execute the solution.
"Movies were, and still are, my basic language," he says. In the 50's, his film-buff expertise propelled him through the contestant tryouts for "The $64,000 Question." He admires independent filmmakers like Errol Morris, yet finds most current Hollywood films formulaic next to childhood favorites like "Citizen Kane," "The Grapes of Wrath" and "Stairway to Heaven." He usually watches them in video form and misses the movie palaces of his youth like the Roxy, whose demolition inspired the set of "Follies."
He misses much of old New York, including the local steak house, Christo's, where he wrote some of "A Little Night Music" in a booth. Nor is he enamored of the malled Times Square.
"I'm nostalgic for the things that aren't there anymore," he says. "I want things to be the way they were because that staves off mortality. So I feel threatened by change."
Sondheim would welcome changes in the New York theater, but doesn't expect any, despite his long efforts to champion his own Hammerstein-like causes, like the Young Playwrights Festival and the Broadway Initiative, an attempt to lower producing costs. "The theater is an acquired taste," he says. "You don't go by yourself at 10 years old -- you're taken. Children don't acquire that taste anymore because it's too expensive, while movies and TV are shoved in their face from the beginning. I don't think the theater will die per se, but it's never going to be what it was. You can't bring it back. It's gone. It's a tourist attraction."
While Sondheim's affections obviously do not lie with writers who cater to those tourists, he won't badmouth Andrew Lloyd Webber, who turns 52 the day Sondheim turns 70. "I've never said anything rotten about Andrew in print, and he never said anything about me. That we're Aaron Burr and Hamilton -- that's everybody else's perception." Sondheim is somewhat more vocal, if understandably perplexed, about Frank Wildhorn's "aura of success" in the new Broadway: "If you add up the millions lost on 'Civil War' and 'The Scarlet Pimpernel,' he's probably the most unsuccessful composer in the history of Broadway in terms of the amount of money lost."
Sondheim has mentored many other young songwriters, including Adam Guettel, whom he finds "dazzling," and the late Jonathan Larson, of "Rent": "Jonathan was on the path of making that bridge between the bus-and-tunnel audience and the young audience. But nobody else does that because other writers into pop don't have Jonathan's interest in the tradition of musical theater." Sondheim is also discouraged that recent musicals confuse his and Hammerstein's idea of the "serious" musical with mere solemnity: "They're so eager to make what they write important that they start with themes instead of stories and characters." He's even more scathing about the British-spawned trend of pseudo-operatic "sung-through" musicals. "What is hard to write are 32-bar songs, particularly if you are telling a story. It's about economy. Recitative is chocolate sauce poured over everything. It impresses audiences because they think it's art and songs are songs. But songs are art."
Given the obstacles to writing musicals today, Sondheim is surprised by the steady contacts from young writers who want to emulate him. But he dispenses realistic advice. "I say write it and put it on any place you can. I warn them Broadway is no longer an outlet for new work. I'm lucky I get my shows on."
It's 1:30 in the morning. The cook has retired, and the house feels as big as it is. The night is old, and I remember when I was one of those young people eager for Sondheim's advice. Sondheim may have no children, but he does have that paternal Hammerstein gene. What he gave me when I was starting out was not just priceless encouragement but a role model for going my own way in my work, whatever the hostilities I aroused along the way. I've heard, and don't doubt, most of the stories from those who find Sondheim difficult, if not impossible, but I plead immunity to them. The vulnerable quality that makes his songs so haunting -- those aesthetic stutters that illuminate the cracks in people's lives -- is to me always visible in the man. Sondheim is well defended with intellectual armor, yet he is still the precocious, awkward kid in the rehearsal photos of "West Side Story," "the boy in the bubble," as he described himself to his biographer, Meryle Secrest. Out of his "difference" he has been making art for nearly 50 years, and for that he has willingly paid a certain price in life.
Of course he is older now, and he has won every establishment prize: Tony, Oscar, Grammy, National Medal of Arts, Olivier, Pulitzer, Kennedy Center Honors. "One of the problems is that I get more frightened each time I write because people are expecting so much. That slows me down. I say, Don't think about it. I never used to. I used to just write and hope that people would like it. Now I'm aware of people. It was very painful to do 'Wise Guys' partly because I thought everybody's going to forget this is a workshop. They're going to come down and expect to be blown away or to hate it if they hate my work.
"I have always conscientiously tried not to do the same thing twice. If you're broken-field running, they can't hit you with so many tomatoes. I certainly feel out of the mainstream because what's happened in musicals is corporate and cookie-cutter stuff. And if I'm out of fashion, I'm out of fashion. Being a maverick isn't just about being different. It's about having your vision of the way a show might be. I mean, doing 'Pacific Overtures' is not being in anybody's fashion. It's not being out of fashion, either. It's called 'Pacific Overtures.' Now, let's go on to something else."
Sondheim hopes two of his experiments, "Assassins" and the now-revised "Merrily," will get new full-dress New York airings in his lifetime. The only project he regrets was his collaboration with Richard Rodgers on "Do I Hear a Waltz?" after Hammerstein's death. Sondheim attributes that production's rancid atmosphere to his sense that "Dick was afraid that his well had run dry."
Does Sondheim have the same fear?
"I worry about it all the time in the last 8, 10 years. Because it's my observation that Broadway composers past the age of 50 never turned out anything good. Cole Porter, Dick Rodgers, you name them. There's a reason for it, which is that every 25 years, every generation, popular music goes through a change. Thus, when I was growing up, Romberg was on the way out, and Rodgers and Hammerstein were on their way in. Then Rodgers and Hammerstein in 25 years got old-fashioned, and in came the sort of new-style musical represented partly by me, by Kander and Ebb, by our generation. Then we passed by, and in comes Jonathan Larson and the Disney generation. And so the fact that I've lived past that age still writing stuff strikes me as surprising. Surprising because most of the time, that's what happens in popular art -- it gets superseded."
For a second, I think of the 15-year-old Sondheim sobbing while watching Jigger in "Carousel" -- the dark, wily misfit making his own solitary path across the stage while the crowd runs off laughing to the clambake. I'm eager to give Sondheim the reassurance he once gave me, and start to argue that since he has always defied the crowd, he might endure even if Broadway does not.
But Sondheim deflects this emotional plea on his behalf as soon as he detects it. "I've never been popular," he reiterates quickly, as if to say, What's the use of wondering if there's any other way his story could have turned out.

Iron Triangle

BYLINE: By William Safire 

 BODY:
On the eve of his victory in the South Carolina primary, recalling his stunning defeat in New Hampshire, George W. Bush said: "People may not think I'm tough enough, but I am. This is a process of steeling me to become president."
Newsweek, reporting on the "hardening" of the candidate during the rough tactics of that Southern campaign, commented, "Consider him steeled." 
 The verb, in its sense of "to make hard or strong as steel," is used in Shakespeare's poem "Venus and Adonis," as Venus says: "Give me my heart. . . . O give it me, lest thy hard heart do steel it,/And being steeled, soft sighs can never grave it." Governor Bush, in subsequent interviews, repeated the verb; he evidently felt that being steeled is an admirable development in a candidate.
Senator John McCain is also partial to a metallic metaphor. "I've taken on the iron triangle: special interests, campaign finance and lobbying," he said in mid-February. A few weeks earlier, his definition was formulated slightly differently: "The establishment obviously is in a state of extreme distress, if not panic, because they know I have taken on the iron triangle of money, lobbyists and legislation."
The origin is military. On United States Army maps during the Korean conflict of 1950-53, an area about 30 miles north of the 38th parallel with its apex at Pyongyang and its corners at Chorwon and Kumhwa was marked "the Iron Triangle." This was the center anchor of the North Korean defense line and the hub of a communication and supply network. During the Vietnam War, an area of 125 square miles northwest of Saigon was called by the same name. Then the phrase was transferred to Europe and used for nations rather than small areas: in 1977, an editorial in The New York Times called East Germany, Poland and Czechoslovakia "the U.S.S.R.'s iron triangle."
Meanwhile, the military phrase was being used as a synonym for what Dwight Eisenhower, in his 1961 farewell, called "the military-industrial complex" -- that is, the military services, defense contractors and members of Congress busy at the pork barrel. In the 70's, the term spread beyond the military to include the cozy relationship among federal agencies, Congressional committees and lobbyists.
Ronald Reagan, as he was leaving office, substituted the media for the military in his triangulation. "A triangle of institutions -- parts of Congress, the media and special-interest groups -- is transforming and placing out of focus our constitutional balance," Reagan warned. Modestly, he did not claim credit for the phrase: "Some have used the term iron triangle to describe what I'm talking about."
McCain left the media out of his iron triangle, substituting "money," so that his three corners are now "money, lobbyists and legislation."
How did his opponent deal with the three-sided ferrous metaphor? George W. Bush's department of figure-of-speech ripostes did fairly well. Another sense of triangle is "an iron rod bent in a triangle with one angle open, used as a percussion instrument or bell when struck with another iron rod."
After being asked frequently about McCain's symbol, he was readied with a colorful reply. "If a man says, for example," said Bush, undoubtedly alluding to the man as McCain, "that there's an iron triangle in Washington, D.C., of lobbyists and special interests, and he's ringing it like a dinner bell to raise money for his campaign, I think that I have a right to point out that he says one thing and does another."
Although Bush's triangle had only two sides, his word-image nicely brought to mind a picture of an iron triangle used sometimes on Texas ranches to call cowhands to dinner.
What is it about iron that attracts phrase makers? John C. Calhoun, vice president under Andrew Jackson, was nicknamed "the cast-iron man" by the English economist Harriet Martineau because he "looks as if he had never been born, and could never be extinguished." Lou Gehrig, the "iron horse" (originally referring to the railroads), was followed by Cal Ripken, the "iron man," who broke Gehrig's endurance record of 2,130 consecutive games in 1995.
But there is a cruel connotation to the word-image. Blood and iron, in German Blut und Eisen, meant "military force as distinguished from diplomacy" and was associated in the 1870's with Prince Bismarck, "the iron chancellor." Autocratic rule was governance with an iron hand. Churchill famously called the Soviet separation of the tyrannized East and the free West the iron curtain, after a fireproof curtain used in French and English theaters as early as the 18th century. (The Viscountess Snowden, after a visit to Russia soon after World War I, wrote, "We were behind the 'iron curtain' at last!") In the United States, the undemonstrative first lady Rosalynn Carter was derogated (unfairly, in retrospect) as "the steel magnolia." The iron rice bowl was Mao Zedong's guarantee to China's workers of a job for life under the Communist system, with cradle-to-grave benefits. President Bill Clinton, celebrating what he believed was the emergence of capitalism in China, said in 1998 that "restructuring state enterprises is critical to building a modern economy, but it is also disrupting settled patterns of life and work, cracking the iron rice bowl."
Thus, McCain's iron triangle has a built-in pejorative connotation. Even the triangle has dark memories, as its evocation in necromancy and in the military usages above indicates. There's also the Bermuda Triangle, where boats disappear mysteriously, as well as the golden triangle, the area of Southeast Asia -- Myanmar, Laos and Thailand -- where opium is cultivated. (On the other hand, people in rejuvenated downtown Pittsburgh, and Texans in the Beaumont-Orange-Port Arthur area, are happy to call their neighborhoods the golden triangle.)

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Real Estate Board's Sales Report;
Co-op Prices Increase In All Categories

 BODY:
With studios and one-bedrooms leading the surge, prices for co-op apartments of all sizes set records in Manhattan last year, according to the Real Estate Board of New York's Annual Cooperative Sales Report. "Remarkably strong demand permeates this exceptional market, regardless of an apartment's size or age or location," said Hall Willkie of Brown Harris Stevens, chairman of the board's residential research committee.
The median price per room for studio apartments rose to $56,800 last year, a 20 percent rise from 1998, and the per-room price for one-bedrooms jumped by 24 percent, to $78,333, according to the report. Until about two years ago, prices for such smaller apartments in Manhattan had risen at a relatively slower pace than larger units. "You have a lot of young people now who can afford these units," said Gregory Heym, the board's chief economist, "and a lot of people looking for a second home in the city." 
 According to the report's guidelines, a studio generally contains 1 to 2 1/2 rooms with, perhaps, a separate kitchen and an alcove. One-bedrooms run from 2 1/2 to 4 rooms. Two-bedrooms run from 4 to 7 rooms, and three-bedrooms from 5 1/2 to 10 rooms including, perhaps, a maid's room and a library; four-bedrooms contain 11 or more rooms.
The median per-room price for two-bedroom co-ops rose by 9 percent, to $119,129, and the median price for three-bedrooms rose to $178,661 a room, a 10 percent increase. In the four-bedroom or larger category, the sample was limited because only 72 transactions were recorded. For those apartments, the median price per room rose by 17 percent last year, to $281,627.

'Luisa Miller' Raises Spoleto Curtain

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO 

 BODY:
A new production of "Luisa Miller" will open the Spoleto Festival U.S.A. in Charleston, S.C., on May 26. The Spoleto Festival Orchestra's performance of the 1849 opera by Verdi will be conducted by Yves Abel, the founder of the Opera Francais de New York, and directed by Christopher Alden.
Spoleto, founded in 1977 by the composer Gian-Carlo Menotti, is the American companion to the Festival of Two Worlds in Spoleto, Italy. This year's United States festival is being affected by the controversy over the Confederate flag, which flies over the State Capitol in South Carolina. The state branch of the N.A.A.C.P. has organized an economic boycott to protest the flag's continued presence, and as a result Bill T. Jones and his dance company have withdrawn from the festival. Nigel Redden, the general director of Spoleto, said that although he personally opposes the flying of the flag, the festival will go on. 
 Major presentations in Charleston will include Gluck's "Iphigenie en Tauride"; "The Silver River," a new version of the music-theater work by Bright Sheng with libretto by David Henry Hwang, based on Chinese folklore; and "Running Man," a collaboration by the poet Cornelius Eady and the jazz composer Diedre Murray.
 The Wachovia jazz series with Kurt Elling, Fred Hersch and Bill Frisell; choral and orchestral concerts, and the annual chamber music series led by Charles Wadsworth are also part of the festival, which runs through June 11.
"Mother Courage and Her Children," Brecht's drama of war and survival, will be presented by the Shared Experience Theater of London. Nancy Meckler will direct the play and Kathryn Hunter, who made a mark in the festival's 1991 presentation of "The Visit," by Friedrich Durrenmatt, will star.
On the dance schedule, Les Grands Ballets Canadiens will perform a program of "Great Europeans" (the choreographers Jiri Kylian, Nacho Duato, William Forsythe). Susan Marshall and Company pay tribute to the new millennium, and Mats Ek's radically reconfigured "Swan Lake" will be performed by the Cullberg Ballet troupe of Sweden.
Tickets, ranging from $17 to $60, can be ordered at (877) 386-7765. On the Internet: www.spoletousa.org. BEN SISARIO

Taking Two Years to Find Just the Right Condo

BYLINE: By TRISH HALL 

 BODY:
SOME people look at apartments the way they check out melons in the supermarket. They might buy something, some day, but if the feel isn't exactly right, they'll pass.
Good brokers can usually tell which shoppers are seriously in need of a new place and which ones are not. Figuring that their time in this market is too valuable to waste, the brokers usually find some way to give browsers the slip. 
 Jill Meilus, a broker with the Corcoran Group, always believed that Elizabeth Bibb and Michael Yamashita would buy something. She just didn't know when. And so for almost two years, she showed them places, probably 40 in all, trying to fulfill their desire for a condo rather than a co-op, two real bedrooms and good light, all for about $450,000.
Ms. Bibb and Mr. Yamashita live in a colonial house in Mendham, N.J., in Morris County, but like to keep a second place in the city. Ms. Bibb, a former magazine editor now studying playwriting, and Mr. Yamashita, a photographer for National Geographic, come to the city for work and for fun, sometimes with their 4-year-old daughter, Maggie.
Nearly two years ago, they decided to sell their one-bedroom duplex on West 15th Street, which they had bought four years earlier for $175,000. It didn't have a bedroom for their daughter, and they figured it was the perfect time to sell and lock in their profit. "We thought we had hit the height of the market," Mr. Yamashita said.
Their apartment sold quickly for $390,000, a record then for one-bedroom apartments in the building. Mr. Yamashita said that, encouraged by his investment-banker brother, who believed that the financial crisis in Asia would provoke a similar one in this country, he expected that prices would fall and that taking their time to buy would be prudent.
That widely held forecast turned out to be wrong, however, and as the real estate market simply continued to rise, going up 20 percent in 12 months in neighborhoods like the Village and Chelsea, they found themselves looking for something bigger even as prices kept outpacing their budget.
INITIALLY, they wanted to restrict their search to Chelsea or the Village, but their broker convinced them they had to look elsewhere to find what they wanted. They were close to buying one place, but they had to act quickly to get the requisite papers together, and with a business trip to Europe that couldn't be canceled, they didn't have time.
A loft in TriBeCa seemed perfect, but they passed on it because of strict subletting rules. Since they sometimes travel on business for months at a time, they want to be able to sublet easily.
As the prices rose, they became increasingly concerned that if they didn't buy something soon, they would be forever priced out of Manhattan. But in early December, with the holidays coming and the uncertainty about Y2K, Ms. Bibb decided to suspend the search. "I had just talked to Jill and said we had given up on the hunt," Ms. Bibb said.
Still, she couldn't really stop looking. "Because of my real estate addiction," she said, "I went to the Internet, and a thing popped up in our price range. I said, 'This must be a typo.' "
Her broker checked and found that there was a contract out but that it hadn't been signed, so they went to look at the place, a two-bedroom condo with a wood-burning fireplace on East 31st Street between Second and Third Avenues.
"When I walked in here, the first thing I saw were those windows," Mr. Yamashita said. "They look Japanese." The shape of the windows, with walls jutting out at either end, will make them perfect for the window seats and shoji screens they plan to install. The windows look out on the church and its courtyard, hardly the dramatic view that had been one of their nonnegotiable demands. But the screens will create a translucent, pearlized light that in its way is just as evocative as the World Trade Center view from their old apartment.
Ms. Bibb felt instantly at home. "It had a very good vibe about it," she said. "There is something very cosmic about how one chooses where to live. It felt like it could be home." The asking price was $460,000, but to outbid the other interested party, they offered $470,000, lured partly by what they considered manageable monthly carrying costs of $730 and monthly taxes of $375. They closed on Jan. 14, using the cash they had kept ready from the sale of their old place.
Although their place has the clean lines of a postwar apartment building, it was actually constructed in 1902 as a school that was part of the Episcopal Church of the Good Shepherd next door. An addition was built in the 1960's after the school was sold and turned into apartments.
Their apartment's modernity is a pleasing contrast to their 18th-century house in New Jersey, Ms. Bibb said, with its three bedrooms, barn, gazebo and five and a half acres. Mr. Yamashita has lived since 1982 in Mendham, a town he discovered when he was taking photographs for a National Geographic article on New Jersey. A native of Montclair, he was entranced by the horse farms and rolling hills, which remind Ms. Bibb of her Kentucky childhood.
The apartment perfectly holds their more modern pieces, like a chair by George Nakashima, the Japanese-American artist. Their new living room is already decorated with some photographs by Mr. Yamashita, including one of the moss garden at Kyoto taken in the rain, and an aerial view of Mount Fuji. A specialist on Asia, Mr. Yamashita took the photographs for "In the Japanese Garden," published by Fulcrum; his wife wrote the text.
Although they hadn't wanted to live so far east in Manhattan, their block has turned out to be a "weird little haven," Ms. Bibb said, with church bells ringing, pigeons cooing and every food they could want around the corner at Todaro's, a miniature Balducci's.
Although Mr. Yamashita jokes that his wife, who did most of the looking, was "the client from hell" for their broker, Ms. Meilus said she always believed they would buy when they found the right thing. Maybe the broker's confidence came from the fact that she had known Ms. Bibb since they were college students spending a semester at the London School of Economics.
Besides, Ms. Meilus said, she has had some clients who have taken even longer. "I have one who's three and a half years," she said. "I'm seeing her this afternoon."

New Apartments Proposed in Downtown Hartford

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON 

 BODY:
AFTER the Capital City Economic Development Authority announced last year that $35 million in subsidies would be available to build apartments in downtown Hartford, months went by and no developers called to express any interest.
"Now, we've got so many proposals we can't fund them all," said R. Bartley Halloran, the panel's chairman. His agency is considering applications for partial subsidies for projects that would, at a total cost of more than $300 million, add more than 1,000 apartments to downtown Hartford. In addition, the state has proposed building 400 apartments at Adriaen's Landing downtown, a proposed $1 billion development on the banks of the Connecticut River. That would more than double the housing stock in the downtown, where fewer than 900 units exist now. 
 "There hasn't been a new apartment building built downtown since Bushnell Towers, and that was in the 1970's," Mr. Halloran said. "It took a long time to get the interest of a couple of national investors, but once that happened, everyone started to ask: 'Wait a minute. What am I missing here? Why are these other developers interested?' "
Among the national developers that have presented projects in Hartford are Casden Properties Inc., a Los Angeles company that owns more than 60,000 units in California. It would handle the 400 apartments proposed for Adriaen's Landing. A second national developer, the Northland Investment Corporation of Boston, has received approval for $30 million in subsidies for a 250-unit apartment tower that will be part of a $120 million redevelopment of the Civic Center.
All of the new apartments will have market-rate rents, and the subsidies will take the form of low-interest loans to developers.
Lawrence R. Gottesdiener, the chief executive officer at Northland, said he hopes to change how people view the city. "We have no illusions that this is going to be a short-term process," he said. "Right now Hartford is a ghost town after 5 p.m. and on weekends, unless there's a special event, and it's going to take a long time to turn that around. But we have the ability to ultimately shape this entire neighborhood, create a 24-hour environment where people can feel comfortable living and working and playing until 11 o'clock at night."
Anthony M. Caruso, the executive director of the Hartford Downtown Council, said that Urban Strategies Inc., a Toronto consulting company, reached a similar conclusion in a study his group commissioned.
"That report saw that housing is going to be a critical piece of any development strategy," Mr. Caruso said. "It clearly demonstrated that if the right opportunity presented itself at the right location and the right price, there would be interest on the part of certain demographic groups to come live in downtown. And I take a similar position. If there aren't people here 24 hours a day, interacting on a business and a social basis, we lose the opportunity to create a vital city."
There is considerable debate over just how many new apartments the city might be able to absorb in the short term, said Donald S. Gershman, the executive vice president of the Konover Investments Corporation in Hartford, which is proposing a $40-million, 22-story apartment building with 154 units overlooking Bushnell Park.
"No one knows for sure what the market is, because there has been nothing built for more than a decade," Mr. Gershman said. "There is a sense that there is pent-up demand in the empty-nester market and in the young professional market. The young lawyers and accountants are moving to Rocky Hill or Manchester now, but there's a sense that a large number of them might like to be within walking distance of their office and downtown activities."
The Bushnell Park property would cater to both empty-nesters and young professionals, he said, with a fitness club, pool, game room and meeting rooms, and a feature not found in many buildings, a suite for guests.
"A lot of what's going to happen in the future is going to depend on the success of the first one or two projects that come on the market," Mr. Gershman said. "If they're well conceived and offer a good living experience, it will have a very positive effect on the overall market."
Other developers think the market could be considerable right from the outset. Among them is Suzanne M. Hopgood, the president of the Hopgood Group, which is proposing a $21 million development of 100 apartments, a 175-room hotel, 600 parking spaces and 8,500 feet of retail space on a parcel bounded by Trumbull, Pearl, Lewis and Gold Streets.
D OWNTOWN right now is 100 percent occupied," Ms. Hopgood said. "Very clearly, the demand has been increasing downtown. I think we're following the trend of a lot of cities. One of the great advantages to Hartford that people are starting to understand is that it has a very strong network of neighborhoods, it's a very active neighborhood city, and for a lot of people that's a very appealing lifestyle."
She said she saw the turnaround starting four years ago, when there was an all-day block party to celebrate the presidential debate that was taking place in Hartford. "That started people thinking, 'Maybe it isn't what we thought it was,' " she said. "So you had a few people move back, and a couple of restaurants open up and maybe a nightclub. Every time you add a couple of hundred units, it adds to the appeal of the city. Certainly in the short term, it could support 200 to 400 new units. I think you also have room for, say, 100 really high-end units, but that's speaking just from owning a building and watching what's going on."
Northland is the first to have its application for the subsidies approved by the economic development authority: $15 million for housing and $15 million for commercial and retail space. Mr. Gottesdiener, Northland's chief executive, said he thinks there is a recognition that his company is committed to the downtown, since its first investment, the 648,000-square-foot Metro Center, which it bought in 1996, came just two weeks after the Hartford Whalers hockey team left the city. Some critics saw this as evidence of a new period of downtown decline.
"We had to go to 29 lenders, but we financed it, closed the deal, and within a short time had brought in 950 new jobs," Mr. Gottesdiener said. His estimate is that downtown could support 1,000 new apartments immediately.
Mr. Halloran of the development authority contends that all of the developers are overly cautious. He said there are 75,000 people working downtown, and 20,000 of them currently live in apartments. "But the apartments are all in Rocky Hill or Cromwell, 25 or 30 miles outside of the city," he said. If Hartford can entice just 10 percent of those workers to live in the city, he pointed out, that's an instant demand for 2,000 units.
Meanwhile, Martin LeGault, the president of the Corporation for Independent Living, a nonprofit housing organization in Wethersfield, said the city and state need to pay more attention to Hartford's existing housing outside of downtown.
He estimated there are 400 vacant houses in the city now. While that is down considerably from 700 three years ago, when the city began an effort to get rundown properties fixed up or torn down, it is still too many, Mr. LeGault contends.
He said his organization has renovated 21 houses and apartments so far at a cost of $2.15 million, and work is under way on another six. It has now started its most ambitious project, a $10 million investment to build or renovate 70 houses and apartments along Mortson and Putnam Heights Streets in the Frog Hollow section near downtown Hartford.
"We can't do just one or two of these properties and have an effect," he said. "We have to do all of them, and we're putting together the financing to do it all in two phases. You have to take a comprehensive approach because you're never going to get homeowners to come in and make an investment in a house if it's sitting by a blighted property."
But his group and others working on inner-city housing -- among them, Broad Park Development, the Urban League and Sheldon Oak Central -- all have to scramble for the few subsidies available, he said. "The only way you're going to have viable downtown housing is if you revitalize the neighborhoods," he said. "Nobody's going to want to live next to a blighted neighborhood. We're not saying downtown development shouldn't happen. It just shouldn't be done to the exclusion of neighborhood development. They should be done in tandem."

HEADLINE: Displacing the Ghosts of Students and Sailors

BYLINE: By MAUREEN MILFORD 

DATELINE: PORT DEPOSIT, Md.

 BODY:
PERCHED on steep cliffs above this curious little riverside town, which is just a mile long and 500 feet deep, is a ghostly granite-and-limestone group of buildings that have preoccupied residents for decades.
The former Tome School for Boys, with its sweeping views of the Susquehanna River, was considered one of the most beautiful boarding-school campuses on the East Coast at its peak in the 1920's. Named for Jacob Tome (the last name rhymes with home), a Port Deposit lumberman and banker and Cecil County's first millionaire, the Beaux-Arts campus was designed by the New York firm of Boring & Tilton, which also designed the main building on Ellis Island and the Heights Casino in Brooklyn. 
 Now, the school has become a symbol of the town's past, particularly its heyday a century ago as a "port of deposit" for goods moving by boat and rail between the Susquehanna Valley and the Chesapeake Bay.
Later, the school became part of the Bainbridge Naval Training Center, etched in the memories of tens of thousands men and women who served there, from 1942 until its closing in 1976.
Flanked by the river to the west and cliffs to the east, Port Deposit, in the northeast corner of Maryland, about 35 miles from Baltimore, has a population of about 800.
The Main Street recalls the town's commercial prominence in the 19th century with Georgian, Greek Revival, Federal, Victorian and Italianate structures built well above street level to avoid damage from floods, which are usually controlled by Conowingo Dam six miles upstream. The entire town is on the National Register of Historic Places.
The Navy did little to alter the symmetry of the Tome School campus. The dozen buildings that lined the quadrangle in a century-old drawing -- the gymnasium, dormitories, classroom buildings, dining hall and headmaster's house -- are completely recognizable today. The row of two-story clapboard houses built for teachers, the heating plant, sidewalks, roads, drinking fountains and even street signs give the impression of a town deserted very suddenly.
Only deterioration of the buildings and the untrimmed grounds, including an overgrown terraced garden and a nine-hole golf course, provide clues that the last class graduated from the Tome School in 1941 and that the Navy closed the base in 1976.
Now, the weedy 1,200-acre tract is facing a new life as development plans, sponsored by the State of Maryland, get under way.
"A shadow of our history is up there," said Erika Quesenbery, a curator at the Paw Paw Museum, named for bushes that once graced the museum entrance. "People feel an amazing sense of pride about it -- and an amazing sense of loss."
The school was built in 1900 with about $1 million of the $3 million bequeathed by Mr. Tome. The trustees in charge of the bequest set about creating an exclusive preparatory school, but its prestige was short-lived, and during the Depression, the school fell on hard times financially.
Robert T. Jones Jr., 77, a retired funeral director who lives in Newark, Del., went to the school in the late 1930's, and he remembers how he liked to stand on the bluff and watch storms whipping up on the Susquehanna.
On Sundays, he recalled, the boys would troop into town to church, descending the steep cliffside steps they called "Jacob Tome's ladder."
At the outbreak of World War II, the Navy came looking for recruit training sites, and the school was sold to the government for $900,000. The entire campus was incorporated into the new naval base, and since 1942, the property has been off limits to most civilians, although drivers crossing the Susquehanna on Interstate 95 can glimpse the elegant headmaster's house and the clock tower of the main classroom building.
Once the Navy closed the base, residents of Cecil County worked for years to reclaim the property. In 1991, the 125-acre Tome School section was annexed by Port Deposit. Then last year, the Navy agreed to transfer the entire site to the State of Maryland.
In a military ceremony last month, attended by Tome graduates, former sailors and local officials, the Navy formally transferred the parcel to the Bainbridge Development Corporation, an agency set up by the state.
I DON'T think people can understand what the significance of that day was to us," said Mayor Wayne L. Tome Sr., a great-great-great-nephew of Jacob Tome. "We've been sitting there looking at that site. It's been a thorn in our sides."
The development corporation, whose board is made of area residents, is charged with developing and marketing the property. Possible uses for the Tome campus include a conference center, retirement community or university extension campus, and the rest of the site could be devoted to recreation, home sites, office buildings or light industry. Development is expected to take place over the next 15 to 20 years.
The first order of business is to create a master plan for the entire parcel, said Harland Graef, a retired DuPont executive who is the development corporation's chairman. A study is also under way to determine the best way to establish a modern water and waste treatment system, and the corporation is now applying for grants to pay for necessary repairs to keep the historic Tome buildings from deteriorating further.
When it comes to restoring the buildings, the development corporation will have its work cut out for it. Vandals made off with much of the ornamentation on the Tome buildings, inside and out. Even the weather vane on the clock tower of Memorial Hall was stolen.
"It was demolition by neglect," Mayor Tome said. "Vandals stripped out plumbing for the copper and chipped out the marble steps."
In 1991, the Navy began tearing down all but 60 of 600 military buildings at Bainbridge, demolishing barracks, mess halls, a hospital, drill hall, indoor rifle range, bowling alley, theater and apartment complex. Among the buildings still standing are a mess hall, a recreation building, barracks, officers' houses, some quite large, and the water treatment plant.
Porter E. May of Malvern, Pa., the president of the Bainbridge veterans' organization, said most of the buildings that were demolished were built as temporary structures during World War II and contained asbestos. In fact, one reason it took so long for the property to be turned over to the state was the need for a massive environmental cleanup that took place in the last 10 years. That included removal of 138,000 tons of soil contaminated with asbestos.
Men and women who served at Bainbridge hope that at least one of the remaining Navy buildings will be used as a museum to honor the 500,000 sailors trained at Bainbridge.
"Anybody who goes up there and just stands in the quiet can literally feel the presence of things past," said Albert F. Bagley Jr., 74, of nearby Havre de Grace, Md., who was one of the first recruits at Bainbridge during World War II. "You can almost believe you hear the men."

HEADLINE: For High-Tech Merger, No New Jobs Soon

BYLINE: By ROBBIE WOLIVER 

DATELINE: ISLANDIA

 BODY:
THE proposed merger between Computer Associates International Inc. and Sterling Software Inc. of Dallas will not open the thousands of technology jobs that some Long Islanders had hoped for, contrary to several recent reports.
What might have been good news for prospective technical personnel is neutralized by the shallow pool of candidates in information technology, or I.T., representatives of both companies say. 
 With a 2.8 percent unemployment rate on the Island and a limited number of technology personnel, Computer Associates, a leading provider of business software, did not have much choice.
"The employment pool is already tight on Long Island," said Gary Quinn, executive vice president of global information and administrative services of Computer Associates, which is based in Islandia. "It's not really large enough to support us if we had a large growth spurt. But right now, we're not lacking for potential employees."
And for the longer term, technology companies are aggressively supporting training and education programs to broaden the range of talent. Computer Associates, which employs 3,000 on Long Island, follows many avenues of recruitment, from luring personnel from smaller companies with attractive benefit packages to offering long-term internships.
Taking advantage of regional colleges and universities, the company has first choice of their graduates. It also courts students from community colleges. "We'll reimburse further education," Mr. Quinn said.
No longer counting on outside headhunters, Computer Associates employs eight of its own full time.
The 24-year-old Computer Associates, a $6.3 billion global corporation with offices in more than 40 countries, has already demonstrated its reluctance to relocate talent from other areas.
"We haven't really needed to do that," said Mr. Quinn, who also oversees human resources for the company. "When we've merged, the companies with which we've merged remained in their own cities, employees remained at their old jobs. That's what happened with Platinum; they all stayed in Chicago. We believe in leaving things intact."
Computer Associates took over Platinum Technology International in July for $3.5 billion. The takeover of Sterling, which specializes in data storage, is valued at $4 billion in stock and should be completed by May.
Cindy Foor, a spokeswoman for Sterling, agreed with Mr. Quinn. "We have no known plans on moving to Long Island," she said. "A lot of the operations will remain as they are."
But there will be opportunities for jobs to move to Long Island in the future, said Elissa LiVecchi, spokeswoman for Computer Associates. "Any acquisition certainly creates more opportunities for additional growth." By 2006, Computer Associates is planning to add more than 5,000 jobs, bringing the total to 8,000.
Mr. Quinn said that while Computer Associates respected the general trend against relocation, the company welcomed the return of those who had moved to Silicon Alley in Manhattan. "We're seeing many tech types who live on the Island and commute to the city change their minds and come back here to work with us," he said.
Computer Associates has set up or participated in several programs to help their employees adapt to life on the Island. One is the Suffolk Home Works Partnership, Suffolk County's affordable-housing alliance, which was set up to offer partial public financing of down-payment costs to first-time home buyers whose employers match the assistance. Computer Associates was the first Long Island company to support the program.
Other perks include one of the largest Montessori-based child development day-care centers in the Northeast, as well as summer and holiday programs for employees' children.
"Why wouldn't they attract the I.T. candidate?" asked Mark Papalexis, president of J2 Resources, a technical-employment firm in Farmingdale. "The pool for I.T. employees is small enough that they can really write their own ticket. So companies like Computer Associates need to win them over with great perks."
Both Mr. Quinn and Mr. Papalexis agreed that since the Island's engineering population dwindled after Fairchild-Republic and Grumman closed, there has not been much of a focus on technical and engineering jobs.
Mr. Papalexis, a 13-year veteran in placing technical personnel, said that although potential workers are available, the pool has not replenished itself during the sharp decline of such jobs over the past two decades.
If there were a large influx of openings from a merger like Computer Associates and Sterling, he said, there would not be enough local talent to fill those jobs.
"With all the businesses consolidating on the Island, it's tightening an already tight market even further," he continued. "After any merger, instead of two entities needing the personnel, only one is hiring. People then move on to other fields."
Computer Associates has worked actively with local schools, hoping to funnel even teenagers into the lucrative field. But it will be another four or five years before a deeper talent pool is developed, Mr. Quinn said.
Already seeing positive results from colleges, Mr. Papalexis said: "Potential employees for lower-level entry positions are being constantly cranked out of the local technical schools. The I.T. field is extremely well paying and Long Island is a very desirable place to live. There are predicted shortages of I.T. people in general, so it's not just Long Island; it's just a little tighter here."
For the longer term, Mr. Quinn is optimistic.
"The community is highly educated and it's near New York City," he said. "It's certainly more appealing than Silicon Valley, where homes are three times what they are here. You have to get creative. You just can't run an ad anymore. You have to work through the Internet, and most importantly you have to offer a great package. Right now Long Island is providing us with a high standard of tech employee. And it will only get better."

HEADLINE: Q&A/Lester M. Crystal;
Newsman With Community College Link

BYLINE: By DONNA GREENE 

 BODY:
AS a journalist for more than 40 years, Lester M. Crystal, executive producer of "The Newshour With Jim Lehrer" on PBS, has met his share of impressive, and yes, he said, occasionally not-so-impressive news makers.
Dr. Henry A. Kissinger is one who fits into Mr. Crystal's impressive category. A longtime resident of the Edgemont section of Greenburgh, Mr. Crystal used his influence to induce Dr. Kissinger to speak at Westchester Community College in Valhalla. 
 Others Mr. Crystal has called on to speak there include Tom Brokaw, Art Buchwald, the humorist Al Franken, the playwright Wendy Wasserstein and the regular essayist on "The Newshour," Roger Rosenblatt.
As one of the news gatherers who went to China with President Richard M. Nixon, Mr. Crystal met Dr. Kissinger in 1972. Later, when Mr. Crystal was president of NBC News, he and Dr. Kissinger worked together on some documentaries.
Mr. Crystal began his news career in 1958 as a writer for radio and television and spent 20 years from 1963 to 1983 in various positions with NBC News before joining "The Newshour." The show, which draws an average of three million viewers each night, is produced in Arlington, Va. Mr. Crystal and his wife, Toby, commute each week from Westchester to Washington. Here are excerpts from a conversation with him:
Q. How did you get involved with Westchester Community College?
A. I'm social friends with Joe Hankin, who is the president of the college, and also with Betsy Stern, who is on the board of the college. She and her husband, Walter Stern, have been very involved in the college. Hearing about the school through them, I became very interested in what I think is the extraordinary work that this school does and that community colleges do across the country.
I think they provide what is almost an unknown service in terms of offering educational opportunities to people who otherwise wouldn't have them. So I joined the board of the college's Foundation and have been on it for several years.
Q. You said the college has done extraordinary things. What do you mean?
A. Certainly in terms of those people who can't afford the high cost of education today, even can't afford the state schools, for those people who don't have the time to devote to college education, for these people Westchester Community College affords great opportunities to get a basic education and to move on either to a better job or a four-year school. There are examples of people who have been able to raise their employment level from one point to another because they were able to take some courses.
Q. Not every community college gets Dr. Kissinger as a speaker. How did that happen?
A. Dr. Kissinger has an association with a number of people at the school, and he very graciously agreed to do this lecture. I think it will be interesting, given his background and his knowledge and the fact that he has stayed very much in touch in the foreign affairs area with everything going on. He travels overseas constantly.
There are two or three functions that the college has that creates a better awareness of the college and its connection with the community. They do a literary symposium every year. They have a celebrity salon in the spring. In addition they have some special award dinners.
Q. The reporters for "The Newshour" never express their personal opinions. How does the program maintain that?
A. That's something we adhere to. I would say in terms of what are the most important fundamentals of our program, one is thoroughness and accuracy and seriousness. The other is fairness and balance. We really do go out of our way not to demonstrate what our opinion is -- to extract information from the people we are talking to, not demonstrate what we know or what we think.
Q. Has any thought been given to changing the serious format of "The Newshour"?
A. We have tried to keep from in any way diluting the seriousness of what we do and not to dumb it down in an effort to make it more popular. But at the same time we are trying very hard to broaden what we do -- to not just concentrate on politics and government and economics and those issues. So we've done sports. We're doing music, arts, books, science, medicine, technology. We're trying to make the program interesting to a greater variety of viewers.
Q. Please describe what is planned for "The Newshour" in this presidential election year?
A. We're always trying to stay on top of how the campaign is developing. We don't have any particular things planned that are new. One of the things that we have done over this primary season, as nighttime debates have become an important factor, we've run extended excerpts in the 8-to-12-minute range. And we will continue following candidates on the stump and giving viewers an extended view of what the candidates are saying. And especially when we get into the general campaign, we will look at the issues very closely. The election is a huge story, and we're going to concentrate on it and try to get as many different perspectives as we can.
I don't know exactly what Dr. Kissinger is going to talk about at the college, but the foreign affairs issues have not really surfaced that much in the primary campaign. But I think they will in the national campaign.
Character is a big issue on people's minds -- character and leadership. What kind of person is this? How will that person react when that inevitable foreign crisis comes down? How will that person react with the question of troop commitments?
Q. Besides Dr. Kissinger, who else among recent politicians has a similar stature?
A. There are many people. I currently have great admiration for Jimmy Carter, not so much in how his presidency went but in how he has conducted himself since in terms of leadership. There are some senators who have since retired that I admire or admired. I think Senators Danforth, Nunn and Boren brought a lot to the public discourse. Also: Hubert Humphrey, Walter Mondale, Mike Mansfield.
Q. Does it come as a surprise how inarticulate some decision makers are?
A. We try not to have them on the air. We try to filter them out. However, when it comes to people in government who are responsible for a particular issue, you do have them on the air because they are responsible, whether they are as articulate as they might be or not. Yes, sometimes it reveals that they don't have a very good grasp of the subject matter and you wonder how they got there. At other times it just may be that the person is just not that good on television and may still be quite good at doing his job.
I'm also amazed how people sometimes get selected to be the government spokesman or the spokesman for an organization. Their grasp of issues is very superficial sometimes, and because they are selected as spokespeople they don't feel free to express their own views, because they're worried about what the boss might say. So, often a particular organization should put the boss on the air who would feel free to engage the subject, instead of the spokesman.
 
Kissinger to Speak
Dr. Henry A. Kisssinger, secretary of state in the Nixon administration, will speak at a benefit tonight at 6:30 at Westchester Community College in Valhalla. Tickets at $500 a couple for dinner and the lecture or $50 a person for just the lecture, which starts at 7:30, can be obtained by calling the college at 785-6558.

Where the Talent Is

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Theatergoers looking for the authentic "performer as activist" and social commentator will never find these artists at glitzy places like Feinstein's or in swank hotels and supper clubs. But they are in neighborhoods across our city, particularly those in which residents daily experience social, political and economic oppression and repression -- not the typical life experience of those who can afford $50 cover charges.
Artistic counterculture is encouraged, and flourishes, in theaters, clubs, bars, galleries, storefronts and lofts in the the East Village and on the Lower East Side. Often the shows may lack the polish of standard, American-style upscale cabaret, but they do have the bite, edge and irony of authentic European-style kabarett. 
 Most of the artists performing their new material in these spaces are desperate for audiences and critics to appreciate and help them develop their craft. Their work may be a bit rough, but the experience is real.
And it is there that future Kurt Weills will be found.

HEADLINE: Iron Furnace Rises Again -- Minus the Soot

BYLINE: By FRANCES CHAMBERLAIN 

 BODY:
CONNECTICUT'S Northwest corner is characterized by pastoral scenes, winding roads and scenic farmland. It's hard to picture that at the turn of the last century there was a sprawling network of blasting hot iron furnaces, billowing soot, trains loaded with pig iron, and an industry that made part of Litchfield County look anything but pastoral.
Today, you have to imagine much of this -- wooden buildings have collapsed or burned, gigantic stone furnaces have collapsed, forget the trains and few signs remain of what was once a thriving business. 
 Along Lower Road in East Canaan, one of three former furnaces in that area has been restored and gives the public an opportunity to see how such a furnace used to operate. In fact, enough interest has arisen around the remains of the iron industry to create "The Heritage Trail," seven sites that tell the story of Connecticut's booming turn-of-the-century iron industry. In the Housatonic watershed, there were 44 furnaces over three states, about 19 in Connecticut.
Fred Hall, Canaan's town historian, said he remembers, as a young child, going out on business with his father, a stonecutter and blacksmith. His father had been called make a repair across the road from the Beckley Furnace, which closed in 1918.
"Someone invited me to come over to the furnace," Mr. Hall recalled. "And I stood by the hearth as the hot iron began running out. I could feel the heat of it, like a volcano."
The temperature in the casting shed probably reached 140 to 150 degrees as the iron poured into troughs. From there it would be cooled and transported to the foundry in Lime Rock for final transformation into something useful like cannons and railroad wheels.
While the industry started in other areas, it was in the region from Stockbridge, Mass., down to Dover Plains, N.Y., that it really became successful, because here there was water power, hardwood forests to make charcoal and hills containing carbonate rock that could be quarried for lime, which removed the impurities from the iron. Wrought iron was first produced in forges shortly after the Pilgrims landed, but in 1644 the first blast furnace began producing tools, nails, cooking utensils, and plows.
Connecticut produced bog ore, which develops from bacterial action in bogs, until 1731, but the discovery of limonite iron in Salisbury triggered the growth of a huge industry. In 1734, the first forge was built in Lime Rock, and for the next 190 years, the iron industry determined how life would be lived in this state.
The Beckley Furnace in Canaan would have eventually fallen into irreparable decay if it weren't for the efforts of a group of volunteers. The Committee for the Preservation of the Beckley Furnace consists of 10 people, including Mr. Hall, Dr. William Adam of Canaan, whose family used to operate the business in the 18th and 19th centuries, and Edward M. Kirby of Sharon, a retired school administrator and historian.
Mr. Kirby combined a serious interest in science with history. "My field was really geology," he said. That led to an interest in the important rock formations that allowed Northwest Connecticut's iron industry to prosper. "They needed this local rock formation to get lime," he explained. "Most came from Salisbury. There was a belt of iron ore and wood from north of Pittsfield to Dover, New York, called the Salisbury Iron District. It has a certain kind of manganese that was shock resistant and therefore perfect for cannons and railroad car wheels."
Today, there are fields waiting for an archaeological dig, all in the hopes that unearthing things will help piece together how the furnace worked. Memories like those of Mr. Hall and old pictures have helped reconstruct part of the history, but iron furnaces were such a common part of life that people didn't always notice the day-to-day routine or make a record of it.
On the other side of Lower Road, across from the Beckley Furnace, trains unloaded lime ore and charcoal, which was ferried across the road by a small suspended bridge to be fed into the top of the furnace.
The furnace started out at 32 feet high, then was later raised to 40 feet. To make a ton of iron, 138 bushels of charcoal had to be fed into the 40-foot-high opening. The furnace was fired up with the assistance of huge bellows, pumping tubs and water power from the Blackberry River, just a few yards away.
Even the language of the furnace sounds quaint today. "The tuyere was a nozzle that shot blasts of hot air into the furnace," Mr. Kirby explained. "The tuyere reduced the amount of charcoal and time to get the furnace up to a productive heat."
The bustle pipe, which came around the furnace from the back, shot air into two tuyeres. In addition to the tuyere arch, and tuyere, there was a "downcomer" to the tuyere, and the bottom of the bosh, where the blast furnace shaft tapered inward to meet the hearth and crucible. Eleven salamanders, dense iron that couldn't be melted down again, were found on the site, each weighing about 10 tons.
Research has indicated that a team of oxen, yoked to a log platform, would drag a salamander to the river where it would be dumped out of the way. Tuyere arches on each side of the furnace give the structure a graceful look and these, plus the casting arch, the hearth, and the bottom of the bosh, give the furnace a Medieval rather than Colonial appearance.
"These types of furnaces date to 1450 in Britain and France," Mr. Kirby said. "The Chinese had even smaller ones dating back to about 700 A.D."
Different furnaces were built in different ways, depending on the time, the available materials and the geographical location, but all made use of this three-fold resource of water power, wood and lime.
A few years ago, Ronald D. Jones, a committee member who lives a short distance away from the Beckley Furnace, helped Mr. Hall create an explanatory sign about the furnace. "I felt it didn't make sense to put up a sign if the furnace is going to fall down," he said. "We formed the best committee; there's no chairman because everyone has an equal interest in the project."
The Committee for the Preservation of the Beckley Furnace had two primary goals. One was to preserve this particular historical monument and the other was to develop the iron heritage trail, an industrial historical route through Norfolk, Canaan, Salisbury, Falls Village, Cornwall and Kent, and into New York and Massachusetts. Mr. Kirby said the Beckley Furnace was intended as a centerpiece, but the trail could also serve as an attraction to tourists, a boost to local economic development, and a source for historical study.
The Beckley structure has been owned by the State Department of Environmental Protection since 1946, but it had no plans to invest in restoration, Mr. Kirby said. The committee started with a Valentine's Day pancake breakfast. They gained legislative support and received $250,000 from the state bonding commission in early 1998. All work was done by the State Department of Public Works.
"Work is now being done on the dam on the Blackberry River, for safety reasons, and there is a move to purchase the remains of the original office buildings so we can do a dig, plus study a partially intact turbine," Mr. Jones said.
"Our idea is to make this all visitor friendly," Mr. Jones said.
Mr. Kirby's passion for the Beckley Furnace restoration was preceded by the management of restoration of the Lime Rock furnace. Retired from school administration and teaching, he has plunged into historical archaeology, publishing, most recently, "Echoes of Iron: The Iron Industry in Connecticut's Northwest Corner" with the help of the Sharon Historical Society and the Connecticut Humanities Council.
"In the 1870's to the 1880's, this area was America's biggest producer of railroad car wheels," Mr. Kirby said. "It seems to have all vanished, but it's out there if you look for it."

HEADLINE: Streetscapes/The Park Row Building, 15 Park Row;
An 1899 'Monster' That Reigned High Over the City

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY 

 BODY:
IT'S still a gawky-looking thing, but the landmark 29-story Park Row Building, at 15 Park Row near City Hall, has nowhere near the impact it did in 1899, when it signaled New Yorkers that tall-building construction was running unchecked.
Now it is almost empty, as the owner prepares for a complete renovation and a partial conversion to residences that is to include two of New York's most unusual apartments -- dual triplexes in the building's two rooftop cupolas. 
 In the 1890's advances in steel-frame construction opened up new opportunities for developers. The height of buildings had been restricted by the limits of bearing-wall construction -- those more than eight stories or so had impossibly thick walls on the lower floors. But steel frames meant that the only limits were elevator service. (There were no height restrictions for commercial buildings until 1916, when a zoning resolution was passed.)
The mid-1890's saw buildings getting taller and taller. Civic organizations protested that they were unsafe, that they blocked light and that they defaced the city. Early in 1896 the Chamber of Commerce announced its opposition to skyscrapers.
But later that year construction began at 15 Park Row, which was to be the tallest building yet and would reach back to Ann Street and Theater Alley. According to research by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, the Park Row Building was put up by a syndicate headed by August Belmont, the financier who in 1900 became the head of the group that built New York's first subway. Belmont was also a horse-racing enthusiast, and established the Belmont Park race track on Long Island in 1905.
He had been active in transit matters since the 1880's, but there is no evidence that his Park Row plan anticipated the first subway project, which was built from 1900 to 1904, ended at City Hall Park across from the Park Row Building and increased the value of downtown properties.
The 391-foot-high Park Row Building -- 26 floors, plus the two three-story cupolas -- was completed in 1899 and succeeded the 350-foot-high Manhattan Life Insurance Building at 66 Broadway, just south of Wall Street, as the tallest building in New York. The foundation of the Park Row Building was made of 3,900 Georgia spruce piles driven into wet sand and topped by granite blocks. About 4,000 people a day worked there, using a semicircular bay of 10 elevators.
In an 1899 article, the building's architect, Robert H. Robertson, wrote that he had tried to make the building "look less than its real height." He had designed the facade, he wrote, so that the floors appeared to be in groups of four or five, and he had added heavy horizontal forms. The building also has four heroic-scale female figures on the front.
Architectural critics were not impressed. In 1898 The Real Estate Record and Guide lamented that "New York is the only city in which such a monster would be allowed to rear itself." The Record and Guide called the cupolas "ineffectual and insignificant" and said that the huge blank side walls were "absolutely inexpressive and vacuous."
Indeed such raw expanses were a frequent sore point with writers. In a 1908 article in The New York Times, the French architect Augustin-Adolphe Rey scornfully wrote of the building that "one side of it is an entirely bare wall -- what difference does it make how the other sides are treated?"
ANOTHER French critic, Jean Schopfer, in his 1900 article "American Architecture from a Foreign Point of View" in the magazine Architectural Review, simply called the Park Row Building "detestable."
The 1900 census taker found two families in occupancy: James Jackson, the building engineer, his wife, Mary, and two children, and Alice Harrison, the "janitoress," a 38-year-old widow, living with her 9-year-old son, Alfred, and Charles Michial, 19, the elevator operator.
The Park Row's reign as the tallest building in New York lasted for nine years. In 1901 another syndicate announced that the Aetna, at 33rd Street and Broadway, would be 455 feet high -- but it was never built. In 1908, however, the 612-foot-high Singer Tower was completed at Broadway and Liberty Street and took over first place.
By the time of the stock market crash in 1929, the Park Row was just another old office building, and it went into receivership. To attract new tenants, the lower floors were redesigned by the architects Clinton & Russell, and much of the heavy stonework was replaced with gleaming bronze. The building has changed little since.
Last year the Landmarks Preservation Commission designated the Park Row Building a landmark, without objection from the owner. Charles Herzka, chief operating officer for Broadway Management, which manages the building, said that "from an economic standpoint it didn't materially adversely affect what we want to do."
Those plans include a gut renovation of the entire structure, including converting the 11th floor and above to 210 rental apartments, at a cost of more than $30 million. The rents are to range from $1,900 a month for a studio to $4,400 for a two-bedroom. The lower floors will remain commercial. Mr. Herzka said that the project would be completed next year and that the most unusual apartments would be the pair made out of the two three-story turrets.
And the cost of living at what was once the highest point in New York? "We'll see what the market can bear," Mr. Herzka said.

HEADLINE: YOUR HOME;
Financing A Home for Zero Down

BYLINE: By JAY ROMANO

 BODY:
AS many aspiring home buyers know, to their regret, the biggest obstacle to ownership can often be the down payment. And while the percentage needed for a mortgage has dropped in the last 20 years from the traditional 20 percent to 10, 5 and in some cases even 3 percent, the prices of homes have doubled, tripled and even quadrupled.
Now some large lenders have started to offer zero down payment mortgages that also allow financing of the closing costs. Some lenders even make it possible for new owners to leave the closing with more cash than they had when they walked in -- at the price of course, of more debt. 
 Paul Reddam, chief executive officer of DiTech.com, a mortgage lender in Costa Mesa, Calif., said that what his company calls a Dream Loan allows home buyers to obtain a mortgage for up to 125 percent of the purchase price.
"This loan is for people who have good credit and strong income but who have never been able to save enough for a down payment," he said. "It's also for people who feel they have a better use for their money than tying it up in their home."
Mr. Reddam said that good credit generally refers to a credit score of 660 or above. The credit score is calculated using factors such as the payment history on other loans, the number of open credit lines and the type and amount of an individual's indebtedness.
"A borrower with sterling credit would have a score above 700, and a 'B' borrower would have a score below 620," Mr. Reddam said. "So a person with a score of 660 is in the middle of the range."
In addition to having a good credit score, he said, a borrower seeking a Dream Loan needs a somewhat better income-to-debt ratio than normally required. In most cases, Mr. Reddam said, for a borrower to qualify for a mortgage, total monthly expenses -- including all recurring debt payments and the payment on the mortgage being applied for -- cannot exceed about 38 percent of gross monthly income. For Dream Loans, however, notwithstanding the income-to-debt ratio, the borrower must have at least $2,000 a month left after all bills are paid.
"There's no application fee, and the actual cost of the loan depends on the person's credit score and how much over 100 percent they want to borrow," he said, adding that the interest rate also depends on the amount of the loan, with the current rate for a 125 percent mortgage around 11 percent. The rate for a conventional mortgage from DiTech, he said, averages around 8 percent.
Another company aggressively marketing zero-equity loans is Countrywide Home Loans in Calabasas, Calif. "We give you a choice," said Stephen Brandt, the company's senior vice president. "You can get either a Zero Down Plus with P.M.I. or an 80/ 20 No Down, No P.M.I."
Mr. Brandt said that the Zero Down Plus mortgage is a 103 percent first mortgage that requires private mortgage insurance. The 80/20 mortgage, he said, is actually two loans -- an 80 percent first mortgage plus a 20 percent home equity loan.
With the Zero Down Plus mortgage, he said, the extra 3 percent usually covers the borrower's closing costs. Private mortgage insurance, typically referred to as P.M.I., is required on first mortgages for more than 80 percent of a home's value. The insurance -- paid for by the borrower as part of the monthly mortgage costs -- provides the additional security needed for lenders to be able to sell such loans to institutional investors on the secondary market.
Mr. Brandt said that the principal and interest payments on a $250,000 Zero Down Plus mortgage for 30 years at 8.875 percent -- the current rate -- would be $1,989 a month. Private mortgage insurance on the part of the mortgage that exceeds 80 percent of the home's value, he said, would add $203 a month, making the total payment $2,192.
The company's other zero-down offering works differently. Since the 80 percent first mortgage is considered a conforming loan, meaning that it conforms to the standards set by Fannie Mae and others who buy the loans from the issuers, then repackage them in pools of securities for purchase by investors, there is no requirement for P.M.I. But while the interest rate charged on the first mortgage is still 8.875 percent, the interest rate charged on the second mortgage -- in essence, a home equity loan -- is 12.875 percent.
The first mortgage, for $200,000 at 8.875 percent, would require monthly payments of $1,591; the home equity loan, for $50,000 at 12.875 percent, would cost $559 a month. The total, $2,150 a month, is $42 a month less than the mortgage that requires P.M.I.
Mr. Brandt said that while the Zero Down Plus loan allows financing of the closing costs, the P.M.I. portion of the monthly payment is not tax deductible. On the other hand, he said, with the 80/20 loan, in most cases the interest on both the first and second mortgages would be deductible.
So what's the catch?
"I think these loans can be extremely risky," said Gerri Detweiler, education adviser for Credit Counselors of America and a co-author with Marc Eisenson of "Slash Your Debt" (The Financial Literacy Center, Kalamazoo, Mich., 1999). "If the value of your house drops, or even if it just doesn't increase, you could be in big trouble."
Ms. Detweiler said that since only a small portion of the monthly payment is applied to the principal in the early years of a mortgage, a homeowner could end up having to sell a house for less than the outstanding balance on the loan. That could easily happen with a home that has a 125 percent mortgage, she said, and is even possible for a home with a 100 percent mortgage when the costs of the sale are considered.
"If anything happens to your income stream, or you have to move unexpectedly, you're stuck," Ms. Detweiler said. "You have no breathing room. You may never get out from under."

HEADLINE: Tenant Harassment And Rent Regulation

 BODY:

To the Editor:
The letter to the editor on Feb. 13 "On Harassment of Tenants" , responding to the Times article "Is It Harassment? Or Is It the Law?" Jan 16 , states that tenant activists predicted that when rent laws were "weakened" by removing all apartments with rents over $2,000 from rent regulation, harassment would increase. The writer concludes that the Times article on harassment should be required reading to prevent further weakening of the rent laws. 
 I read the same article and I conclude that all apartments should be freed from any form of rent regulation, ending an unrealistic and unfair economic system that, in addition to inducing harassment, causes wholesale decay of existing housing and discourages new housing from being built. Once rent regulation was ended, there would be no reason for owners to harass. When tenants pay market value, why would owners try to force tenants to move?

A Wave of Construction on Jersey City's Waterfront

BYLINE: By RACHELLE GARBARINE 

DATELINE: JERSEY CITY

 BODY:
WALK outside the PATH stations at Exchange Place or Newport Center here, and the Hudson River waterfront is much different than it was just two years ago.
Tracks for the first half of the 20-mile riverfront light-rail system have been laid from Bayonne to the area, and trains are expected to start rolling next month. At the water's edge there also are two hotels, hundreds of new apartments and six office towers with 2.6 million square feet of space recently completed or under way. 
 Most of the office space has been built at the huge Newport Center complex at the northern end of the Jersey City waterfront and at Colgate Center, the site of Colgate-Palmolive's former toothpaste factory about a mile south of Newport Center. And most of it has been leased by Manhattan-based companies, including Merrill Lynch, which is expanding by 300,000 square feet. All of this activity reflects the fact that Jersey City's riverfront has become a viable corporate address.
The activity shows no signs of abating, with construction expected to start this year on two more buildings, with nearly two million more square feet. A third building, with 1.3 million square feet, is to be started by Goldman, Sachs, the investment bank, which owns the site.
Those buildings would bring the total of office space -- built, under way or about to be built -- to 4.6 million square feet, said Robert P. Antonicello, the president of the ACI Real Estate Group in Jersey City. When added to the existing 7.5 million square feet, the Jersey City office market mushrooms to 12.1 million square feet, surpassing Newark as a Class A market, he said.
"Before, companies had to take a leap of faith to move here," Mr. Antonicello said. "Now, with the infrastructure and critical mass here, it's a no-brainer."
What is also spurring construction is the tight office market in New York, said Charles R. Borrok, a vice chairman in the Manhattan office of Cushman & Wakefield, the national brokerage company that is the leasing agent for Newport Center. "In the last three months as Manhattan's rents have increased and space there has been absorbed, Jersey City has flourished," Mr. Borrok said. Today's riverfront, he added, is not just attractive for financial-services companies or back-office operations but to a mix of businesses, including media and Internet companies, some of which are moving their headquarters here.
As proof he pointed to Lord, Abbett & Company, an investment firm that relocated its operations from the General Motors Building in Manhattan, and the Insurance Services Office, an information clearinghouse, which is moving its headquarters from 7 World Trade Center.
The activity may spill into nearby Hoboken. Construction of a 550,000-square-foot building on Hoboken's southern waterfront may start this year if a lease being negotiated with John Wiley & Sons, the publisher, is completed. Wiley is looking for 300,000 square feet for its headquarters, now in Manhattan. The Wiley building would be one of a pair of similar-size buildings that SJP Properties of Parsippany could build next to the landmark Hoboken Terminal.
"The Hoboken building is a forerunner, but we have not yet come to agreement with government agencies over the tax incentives," said Susan Spilka, a Wiley spokeswoman.
At the end of 1999, the Hudson County waterfront had a vacancy rate for prime space, most of it in Jersey City, of 2.5 percent, down from 3.9 percent the year before, making it among the tightest markets in North Jersey's 11 counties, Cushman & Wakefield reported. It is also one of the most expensive in New Jersey. The average annual asking rents rose to $34.41 a square foot for prime space last year, from $32.97 in 1998. The average for the 11 North Jersey counties was $28.50 in 1999. Still, the waterfront figure of $34.41 is nearly half the cost of new space in Manhattan, Mr. Borrok said. When other benefits are factored in -- lower rates for electricity, real estate taxes and operating costs -- the price is reduced another $10 to $15 a square foot, he said.
THOSE factors are giving developers confidence to continue to build. "The waterfront is in a period of hyperactivity," said Richard S. LeFrak, the president of the Lefrak Organization in Rego Park, Queens, the developer of Newport Center, where it is completing its second new office building in two years. "We have the right product at the right price," Mr. LeFrak said, adding, in a reference to his father, Samuel J. Lefrak, "and an 82-year-old chairman who is screaming he wants to see the project get done and is willing to invest his resources to see that happen."
Last week, the company announced it would start construction next month on a third speculative office tower. The strategy? "Build it, and they will come," Richard LeFrak said.
With 800,000 square feet, this third new building will be similar in size to the one now under way. Nearly 500,000 square feet of that building is leased to three tenants: the Insurance Services Office leased 390,419 square feet, and U.S. Trust and Automated Securities Clearance, 40,000 square feet each. Leases are are being negotiated for the rest of the space, Mr. LeFrak said. The first building, with 567,318 square feet, is fully leased. Rents for the new building will range from $32 to $33 a square foot.
The Lefrak Organization is also planning a full-service hotel with about 450 rooms to complement the 189-room Courtyard by Marriott Hotel that will open in July. "The center is beginning to feed on itself," Mr. LeFrak said.
The arrival of Goldman, Sachs, many real estate brokers and developers said, is a big boost for Jersey City. Last month, the company bought four parcels at the 20-acre Colgate Center site, where it intends to build three buildings, including a training center, on three of the sites. The total square footage will be about three million. Construction on the first building, with 1.3 million square feet, is to begin this year; this building will house several Goldman, Sachs operations, including its asset management group.
Hartz Mountain Industries of Secaucus is under contract to buy the fourth Goldman, Sachs parcel, at 77 Hudson Street, in Colgate Center. Zoning would permit a building as large as 1.1 million square feet. The site is near two other Hartz buildings, one complete and one under construction.
"We believe there is still time left in this real estate cycle to develop," said Emanuel Stern, the president of Hartz.
His company's first building, at 90 Hudson, with 422,000 square feet, is fully leased, and its tenants include Lord, Abbett & Company. The second building, at 70 Hudson, with 412,000 square feet, is under way. Annual rents are expected to be about $35 a square foot.
The Datek Online Holdings Corporation, with offices in Edison and Manhattan, is looking at the possibility of leasing all of 70 Hudson for its growing stock-brokerage business. "We're definitely looking at that and other buildings," said Michael Dunn, a spokesman, "and hope to make a decision fairly soon."
Mr. Stern said only that "there was a lot activity on the building" and that he was now focusing on 77 Hudson. He said he hopes construction there will start by year's end.
"There's no overbuilding, rents are going up, and Wall Street is still growing," he said.
Merrill Lynch also is expanding at Colgate Center. The company, which occupies 600,000 square feet at 101 Hudson Street, has leased an entire 300,000-square-foot building at 95 Greene Street. It will be used for the "expansion of similar technical and operational groups," said Michael R. Cowan, the head of corporate real estate at Merrill Lynch, and 1,400 workers will occupy the space later this year. The former factory is being renovated by SJP Properties.
Late last year, Merrill Lynch also bought a Colgate Center parcel, zoned for a building as large as 1.2 million square feet. "We're growing our support functions in Jersey City so our front office can expand in Manhattan," Mr. Cowan said. The space that could be built at Colgate "gives us the flexibility we want to continue to grow," he said, noting that eventually, there could be 7,000 employees in Jersey City.
The last parcel at Colgate Center was acquired by Essex Waterfront, a Manhattan partnership formed by Leonard Boxer, a Manhattan real estate lawyer; Lester Fisher, a developer in Purchase, N.Y.; and the Ramius Capital Group, an investment banking group in Manhattan. which plans to build 650 apartments, completing the plan drawn up by Colgate-Palmolive a decade ago. Now, the company is hoping to move the landmark 55-foot octagonal Colgate Clock to a new waterfront location, Robert Murray, a spokesman said.
At the 1.9-million-square-foot Harborside complex, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter & Company, already a tenant, has sublet an additional 45,000 square feet and is said by industry professionals to be interested in expanding its space there gradually by up to 1 million square feet. While the Mack-Cali Realty Corporation of Cranford, which owns Harborside, confirmed the sublet, it declined to comment about any further expansion plans. Dean Witter declined to comment on the sublet or an expansion.
Mack-Cali said it would finish the 185,000-square-foot building it is constructing at the site for T. D. WaterHouse, in two months. By this summer the company also will start construction on a 350-room Hyatt Hotel on a pier jutting into the river.

The Aid Is All Spent, But the Police Stay

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS 

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
Six years ago, the federal government held out a tantalizing offer: Money for cities and towns to hire police officers, paying up to 75 percent of the salaries and benefits for up to three years. The catch: The officers had to be additions and not replacements, and the municipalities had to agree to keep the officers after the aid had lapsed.
The money to pay for the new officers is about to end -- or has, in some circumstances -- and municipalities that over time had wrung almost $150 million to hire the 1,950 officers must now begin to weigh the cost of keeping them on the payroll. 
 Whether it is Spring Lake, where only a single additional officer was hired, or Newark, where 220 were added to the force, it is a time of hard choices and fiscal legerdemain. For still others, it means using surpluses from growing ratables with little or no effect on individual tax bills.
Interviews with officials in several muncipalities found them generally pleased with what the new officers have enabled them to do -- though somewhat perplexed as they seek ways to keep the officers.
The program introduced by President Clinton in 1994 has proven so popular that there are efforts in Congress to extend it for another five years, said David Buchanan, a spokesman for the Justice Department's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, which oversees the program.
Mr. Buchanan said in a telephone interview that most municipalities saw the program as a long-term solution rather than a quick fix. Consequently, most had found ways to assume the full cost of the new officers as the financing ended in December -- or in next year's budgets in cases where the assistance is to end in October.
For Newark, keeping the new officers has accounted for the bulk of a 3 percent tax increase in the latest budget proposed by Mayor Sharpe James. But Mayor James said in an interview that he had no regrets. The new officers -- financed with $16.5 million in federal funds spread over a six-year period -- have largely contributed to the decline in the number of auto thefts in a city that once had the dubious honor of leading all municipalities in that category.
In addition, the mayor said the new officers have played a role in the 45 percent decline in overall crime over the last five years. "It was not even a choice considering not continuing them," said Mayor James, noting the increased nightlife in the city since the opening of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center and plans for a new arena. "More police means a reduction in crime as well as an attack on the myth that Newark can't be a safe."
In Northvale, in Bergen County, where the program has paid for three new officers, Mayor John Rooney can even name them. The township of 4,600 people now has a force of 13 officers as a result of the $225,000 in federal assistance.
The addition of the new officers came at a time when older officers were retiring and the department's average salaries were beginning to decline, said Chief Edward Gianotti. In addition, the new officers contributed to a drop in overtime that was bloating the budget. The combination of those two factors, Mayor Rooney said, allowed the township to absorb the new officers.
"It was a great program and it came at the right time for us because we needed new blood but were holding off on hiring anyone," he said. "With the higher-salaried guys aging out, we can afford to keep the new officers at lower salaries without raising taxes."
In Atlantic City, which received $3 million over six years to hire 40 officers, Andrew Mair, the city's business administrator, said that the government had been aggressive in seeking an array of grants to keep the officers at a time when local funds were not readily available.
Mr. Mair said it was like "managing a stock portfolio," moving officers from one grant program to another. With the money coming in and older officers in higher pay grades retiring, he said the department had been able to maintain the level of the police force at 450 officers.
Nor is he concerned about the day the grants run out. "We don't have a static ratable base, but massive planned development will mean billions in ratables by the time the grants all expire," he said.
Growth is at once the rationale for keeping new police hires and the means for paying for them in South Brunswick, said Mayor Deborah Johnson.
"Because of industrial growth, we have a surplus and we were going to need additional police any way to cope with the growth," Mayor Johnson said, explaining the town's initial decision to seek $375,000 in federal funds for five new officers. "So from the beginning we had the mind-set that we were going to pay for this."
But that has still meant some scrimping for the 70-member force, she said. For example, the department brass would like to have had five new police cars next year -- but they decided to get by with two of them a little longer and just buy three.
For some municipalities, the painful reminder of student violence in such instances the shootings in Littleton, Colo., last year has kept up the pressure for an increased police presence in the schools.
In the fiscally distressed city of Camden, where state officials now supervise the budget, October is the cutoff date for continued federal contributions, which totaled $4.2 million for the hiring of 23 officers. It is also working with funds from another grant, which will not run out until 2002.
Richard Wright, the finance administrator in Camden, noted that even though Camden had been operating with a "structural deficit" as a result of a declining tax base and levels of state aid that had not kept up with inflation, local and state officials sought grants without giving much thought about how to continue the financing.
This year -- for the first time in five years, Mr. Wright said -- the state aid received by the city would be indexed for inflation, a move that was expected to provide an additional $700,000. Still, he said, the cost of paying for the additional officers after the federal funds this year is $750,000.
"The police department has submitted a retention plan for these officers, and so we will no choice but to increase our budget, and we don't know what they will mean for other services," he said.
Moreover, Mr. Wright said that officials were wary of seeking future federal assistance that would eventually require them to pick up the tab. For now, the city is holding off on seeking federal funds to hire officers to patrol the schools until the board of education agrees to help with the cost.
In Spring Lake, an upscale shore community in Monmouth County, the federal program allowed the town to hire one officer and bring the force serving its 4,000 people to 14, said Mayor Thomas J. Byrne III.
Mayor Byrne said that since the town hired only one officer there would be no problem absorbing that salary.
"There may be a tax increase, we don't know yet," he said. "But if there is one, it won't be because of the additional police salary but because of the generally higher costs of everything."
In Paterson, Mayor Martin Barnes, a Republican, was less sanguine, noting that federal help in paying the salaries for about 20 of the 60 officers hired under the program had ended and that the city faced a "major burden" in assimilating them.
Mayor Barnes said the Clinton administration sold the program with much fanfare and made it irresistible in communities where residents were clamoring for more police without understanding that the short-lived benefit came with a price tag.
"We knew it was a false sense of security, but at the same time we were constrained by local pressures to take the grants," said Mayor Barnes, noting that a tax increase to meet the city's $140 million budget might be necessary. "We're just going to have to come up with the bucks for this first group, but we are in trouble in 2002 when the federal assistance on that second, larger group ends."

HEADLINE: OPERA;
Presenting the Grandeur That Colors Verdi's Aida

BYLINE: By JILLIAN HORNBECK AMBROZ 

DATELINE: NEWARK

 BODY:
INTERNATIONAL divas and their blue-jeaned male counterparts march around the small wooden dance floor of the Crystal Room of the Robert Treat Hotel here. Bewitching, powerfully performed melodies swirl around upturned red velvet banquet chairs, substituting for grand-scale props. An imposing tub of cough drops and a water cooler provide the singers' oasis between scenes.
It is the second day of rehearsals for the New Jersey State Opera's production of "Aida," Giuseppe Verdi's 1871 classic. The artistic director, Alfredo Silipigni, has assembled a diverse cast of far-reaching talent in his effort to bring "world-class opera to the citizens of New Jersey." His production will be presented this week on the stage of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center for three performances, including a one-act performance for students. All performances will include English supertitles. 
 "Aida" is the tragic love story of an enslaved Ethiopian princess in love with an Egyptian warrior, Radames, who conquers her homeland, and captures her father, the King of Ethiopia. Radames is also the object of affection and intended spouse of Amneris, an Egyptian princess. Radames chooses Aida, betrays his country in the process, and is condemned to be buried alive. In a heart-wrenching finale, Aida elects to die by his side in classic tragedy fashion.
Arguably the world's most performed opera, "Aida" caters to a wide audience. Verdi's score is enchanting and grand, full of rich arias and well-known marches. Book ended by two glorious arias, "Celeste Aida," sung by Radames in the first scene of the opera, and "O terra, addio," the final duet by Aida and Radames as they are entombed in the last scene, the captivating melodies have ageless appeal.
In the title role, Daniela Longhi, an Italian lyric soprano whose acting style may be a bit subtle for an emotional role, possesses an impressive vocal high range shadowed with warm, dark hues. The Bolshoi Opera's prima donna, Makvala Kasrashvili, gives a powerful performance as Amneris, perhaps at times even overshadowing the lead. Interestingly, Verdi considered calling his opera "Amneris," as the rival mezzo-soprano plays such a strong role. Given Ms. Kasrashvili's considerable talent, one may wish Verdi had followed through with that idea.
Constantin Nica, a Romanian tenor, performs Radames, projecting an engaging stage presence and displaying a comfortable relationship with the high notes in his demanding role. George Fortune, a baritone who has performed with Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti, is Amonasro, the King of Ethiopia. Luiz-Ottavia Faria, winner of the New Jersey State Opera competition, sings the role of the King of Egypt, with a rich and soulful bass. Stefan Szkafarowsky, a bass renowned for his technical ability, performs the role of the high priest Ramfis. And the tenor Gabriel Barrueco, a native of Cuba, performs the role of the messenger.
The State Opera's production also offers 28 West Orange High School students the opportunity to sing in the 70-member chorus. Their teacher, Cynthia Rowberg Pearson, a longtime student of opera, was selected to perform the role of the High Priestess. Backing this immense vocal ensemble is an 80-piece orchestra, including six Egyptian trumpets, conducted by Mr. Silipigni. Adding to the grandeur, eight ballerinas from the New Jersey Ballet, perform with choreography by George Tomal.
"Other than the Wagner Ring, few operas are as costly to produce as 'Aida,' " said Scott Holderer, production manager for the New Jersey State Opera. "This is by far the most expensive production this year for us." he added, "Aida," costing hundreds of thousands of dollars, accounts for nearly 40 percent of the State Opera's annual budget, he added.
Over the years, opera buffs have come to expect all sorts of pageantry and gimmicks from "Aida," from explosions to onstage livestock. Mr. Silipigni intends to deliver a production that is pure and traditional, closely following Verdi's original score and stage directions. That means no elephants or horses. However, compared with Verdi's gaslit performances, Mr. Silipigni and the renowned former Metropolitan Opera stage director Nathaniel Merrill are bending the rules a bit to incorporate some modern effects.
"A large portion of our audience will experience their first standard repertoire with us and we want it to be world class," said Mr. Silipigni, who has been with the State Opera since its inception. "The emphasis will be on the music, the cast, the chorus and the ballet."
Though limiting for a full-scale production, the small stage of NJPAC will be transformed into an Egyptian setting, complete with temples, thrones and a flying statue of Isis. The colors of the stage, earth tones with copper and gold highlights, match the elaborate, bejeweled costumes, designed by the Emmy Award winner Peter Hall.
On the eve of another opera mutation, this time perpetrated by Disney and Elton John for Broadway, the New Jersey State Opera offers a traditional, more economical alternative with its newest production.

Builder Fights to Finish High-Rise the City Says Never Began

BYLINE: By DAVID KIRBY 

 BODY:
The city has rejected the appeal of a developer who wants to build a 20-story high-rise on West 18th Street, where zoning rules were changed last year before the building's foundation was completed. A six-story building would be allowed. But the developer, Martin Brody, vows to fight on.
Mr. Brody obtained a building permit last summer for an apartment tower at 224 West 18th Street, between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. On Sept. 9, new zoning rules took effect restricting development in the area to smaller buildings. 
 Soon after, the city rescinded Mr. Brody's permit. He contended that he should be permitted to finish the building because its foundation had been largely completed before the zoning changes took effect.
But in a Feb. 29 ruling, the Board of Standards and Appeals said it found "no evidence that any foundation work had commenced."
Mr. Brody, the board said, "entered into this development project aware of impending zoning amendments," and "took a calculated gamble" by trying to "race the clock."
"Neither the mere issuance of permits, nor the developer's substantial expenditures and physical improvements are enough, standing alone, to confer a vested right to the project," the board said.
Mr. Brody's lawyer, Adam Roth- krug, said he would appeal the decision in court and would seek a zoning variance from the board.
"My client has spent over $1 million based on the zoning that was in effect when he began," Mr. Rothkrug said. "The building that would be permitted now is not economically feasible. He won't build that."

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: UPPER MANHATTAN;
Filling a Wire-Hanger Void, Dry Cleaner Expands Kingdom

BYLINE: By NINA SIEGAL 

 BODY:
In most parts of Manhattan, dry cleaners are as common as brush on a prairie. But in the northern reaches of the borough, from Harlem to Inwood, residents often voice the same lament: "Where, oh where, can I get my shirts pressed?"
It may seem like a superficial complaint in neighborhoods with many other social ills. But people spearheading the economic development of Upper Manhattan say the dearth of dry cleaners can affect whether wealthier New Yorkers are willing to live and invest in the area. 
 Luckily, Jose O. Aguiar Jr. was trained all his life to become uptown's Kleener King. When his parents, Jose and Carmen, who came from Puerto Rico, married, they used a small inheritance of hers to open a dry-cleaning shop on Intervale Avenue in the Bronx. By the time their son was an adult, they had five stores, all with different names. Jose Aguiar took over the business when his father died 17 years ago, then developed the Kleener King brand and logo, using Blockbuster Video as his model. Eventually, he opened 19 stores under that name.
Last year, Mr. Aguiar received a $6.1 million loan from the Upper Manhattan Empowerment Zone, the Bronx Overall Development Corporation, the Empire State Development Corporation and other investors to continue his expansion. He plans to open 10 stores in Upper Manhattan and the Bronx in the next two years, creating 200 new jobs.
Mr. Aguiar opened the first of the 10 at 215 Dyckman Street, at Broadway in Inwood. On the bustling stretch of Dyckman between Broadway and Post Avenue there are discount stores, check-cashing places and many other businesses, but the Kleener King, painted in the chain's distinctive royal blue and gold, is the first dry cleaner.
"You see dry cleaners on every block of Manhattan, because it's all white collar," Mr. Aguiar said. "I'm in blue-collar areas. That means we have to take a different approach to dry cleaning."
To accommodate lower-income customers, Mr. Aguiar said, he has to charge less: $3.50 on average for a pair of pants. Since his stores are in neighborhoods where rents are cheaper, he saves some money on overhead, but the big savings come from centralizing operations. Two months ago, Kleener King opened a dry-cleaning plant in Bathgate Industrial Park in the Bronx, which he hopes will ultimately serve about 50 stores.
"When I started getting a real feel for the business in 1986, I looked at Blockbuster and McDonald's and I couldn't even see myself in that space mentally," he said, seated in a royal blue chair in his new store. "As I sit here today, I can see it." NINA SIEGAL

HEADLINE: My Dress Is Older Than Yours Is

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE 

 BODY:
On a sale rack at Jeffrey on West 14th Street one day shortly after Christmas, there hung a cap-sleeve minidress cut in the same "Jetsons go to Coconut Grove" manner that led Courreges, the Parisian house that made it, to prominence three decades ago. Originally $1,500, it was marked down to $800.
That same afternoon at Resurrection, a Mott Street shop selling vintage apparel -- the clothing formerly known as used -- a similar version of that orange Courreges dress, actually made and worn in the 1960's, was also for sale. The vintage model was $1,200. 
 A visit to Resurrection suggests that clothing is not in fact the world's most bubble-headed investment. Next to the Courreges was a navy A-line Pierre Cardin minidress from the same period with white vinyl trim and a circle in the center -- the kind of dress that would make the wearer look like a 7-year-old who has been reading Buckminster Fuller. Anyone hoping to leave the store with it would have to part with $1,500.
In the past 20 years, the vintage-clothing market has undergone marked changes, catering of late to a fashion elite that is hungry to signal that it has acquired something that other people haven't and can't. Through the 1980's, the market was fueled by sales of 50's bowling shirts, 40's floral housewife dresses and jackets once worn by gas-station attendants -- working-class clothes from which college students could forge ironic wardrobes for very little money. But with the growth of stores like the Gap and Old Navy in the 90's, and the widespread availability of inexpensive khakis, pedal pushers and shift dresses that are inspired by old ones (the Gap's current line is called "1968"), many purveyors of vintage clothes had to rethink their strategy. They began offering rarefied and more costly merchandise.
Alice Lindholm has sold old clothes for 15 years; when she started her business, Right to the Moon Alice, she conducted most of it directly on college campuses, traveling from Cornell to Vassar to Oberlin with her stock. With the boom in tasteful, lower-priced clothing, "we had to reinvent ourselves," Ms. Lindholm said. Today, she and her husband, Ron Lindholm, have Chanel sweaters and Schiaparelli hats moving in and out of an inventory they keep in Cooks Falls, N.Y. The Lindholms sell at vintage shows like the one to be held at Pier 88 over the next two weekends.
What the term "vintage" means in reference to clothes is, as one might expect, the subject of some debate. To Liz Goldwyn, 23, a filmmaker and avid collector-wearer, with 150 Yves Saint Laurent pieces, most of them older than she is, vintage is defined as anything more than 10 years old. To Mark Walsh, a private dealer who traffics in clothes worth thousands of dollars from the early 1900's through the 30's, vintage clothes are those meant for museums. ("I'm not crazy about the wearing clientele," he said.) Anything from the 70's and 80's he dismisses as "thrift shop."
At the moment, though, among the broad range of people who consider themselves fashionable, vintage implies clothes made by well-known designers from the mid-20th century onward, mostly the 60's and 70's -- the period that continues to maintain a bottomless fascination for popular culture.
Ina Davidson, who runs Buy Gone Days, based in Montgomery, N.Y., has been a vintage-clothing dealer for 20 years, selling garments to designers who use them for inspiration and to people who wear them to dinner. Recently, she said, she has become "compulsive" about acquiring high-profile clothes from the Lyndon Johnson years through the Gerald Ford years. "Either you have designer clothes from the 60's and 70's or you're not going to make money," Ms. Davidson said. Six months ago, she came upon 10 Rudi Gernreich dresses from this period and has sold 9 of them, one for $1,200.
Resurrection focuses exclusively on clothes from the 60's and 70's. Katy Rodriguez, 30, the store's owner, a former student of fine-art photography, opened her first store on East Seventh Street in 1996. Two years ago she added the Mott Street shop, and in May she will open a third Resurrection in Los Angeles. During her four years in business, Ms. Rodriguez said, customers have become increasingly eager to delve into high-end vintage. The same has been true at What Comes Around Goes Around, a vintage shop on West Broadway, where the Puccis and Halstons are chained up.
In the beginning, Ms. Rodriguez said, "we'd sell a Pucci dress for $250 and we'd have to explain to the customer why it was $250." Today, the customer knows something about a Pucci dress and is willing to pay the $500 or more it now easily costs.
In fact, expensive old clothes have been so sufficiently scrubbed of whatever negative stigma they once had that Barneys New York is opening a vintage boutique on April 1 in its Madison Avenue store. Across the street at DKNY, vintage pieces have been selling as part of the mix since the store's opening in August, just as they have at the Polo Sport store on West Broadway since it opened in July.
The Barneys shop, on the third floor, will be run in conjunction with Cameron Silver, the owner of Decades, a Los Angeles vintage store that, like Resurrection, specializes in clothes from the era of Gucci's original heyday.
Among the items at Barneys are some chain-mesh halter tops from Whiting & Davis and two 60's python jackets -- one from Lanvin, the other Bill Blass -- that Mr. Silver and Julie Gilhart, vice president for fashion merchandising at Barneys, found in January at the Metropolitan Vintage Fashion and Antique Textile Show, which is held three times a year and attracted a record 65 dealers this winter. The python jackets cost more than $2,000 each, and they are likely to cost more than twice that when they reach the store.
In the era of the unstoppable economy, however, with growing numbers of people actually able to part with the thousands of dollars a few Jil Sander sweaters could cost, the appeal of buying vintage clothes at an elevated level is the comfort of knowing you won't be an exact replica of someone else.
In 1998, Kim Kassel, a 30-ish Upper East Side resident who attends many charity benefits with her husband and who now works in public relations at Jeffrey, wore a Dolce & Gabbana to the Metropolitan Museum's Costume Institute gala, only to find that someone else was wearing it, too. So in December 1999, Ms. Kassel attended the gala in a beaded blush-colored Norman Norell gown she bought from Rita Watnick, owner of Lily in Los Angeles, perhaps the country's most exclusive vintage boutique.
"There was a fur-trimmed Oscar dress," Ms. Kassel said of a new Oscar de la Renta style she spotted at the Met party. "Three people had it. It's a $9,000 dress."
Ms. Kassel could not abide vintage clothes a few years ago, she said, because "old had a negative connotation for me." But she said her introduction to Ms. Watnick's pristine collection, as well as the heightened exposure vintage clothes received during the tenure of the socialite Tiffany Dubin as head of the fashion department at Sotheby's, helped her change her mind.
Another woman wearing vintage at the Met party in December was Laura Steinberg Tisch, who had on her mother's Warhol-inspired Emeric Partos fur jacket from the 60's.
Another important reason for the flowering of interest in old clothes among people accustomed to buying costly new ones is that contemporary fashion has gone beyond simply invoking the past, the period of the 60's and 70's especially, to photocopying it. Prada's spring 2000 collection is a replay of Yves Saint Laurent's wardrobe for the 1967 film "Belle de Jour," as so many fashion editors have pointed out. This, in turn, has sparked the market for vintage Saint Laurent pieces from the era. "I could go out and spend $500 on a Prada shirt," Ms. Goldwyn said, "or I could buy what it was copied from and have something that no one else has."
As the crowds funneled out of Marc Jacobs's very-Julie-Christie-in-"Darling" fall show in New York last month, the expression one kept hearing people use to describe it was "vintage-y." In London the following week, a young designer named Russell Sage, who recycles vintage fabrics, formulated the most aggressively postmodern comment on the already postmodern notion of mining the past by sending an old John Galliano jacket down the runway with the Sotheby's price tag still hanging on it.
Ronnie Cooke Newhouse, a former creative director at Barneys and Calvin Klein and a vintage shopper, said she felt that vintage dealers had become what stylists were in the 80's; that is, crucial influences on the designer's creative process.
That fashion has drawn so heavily from the 60's and 70's and that the diligently stylish now hanker for the actual sources of inspiration, rather than their more commonplace but not very different-looking byproducts, suggests that consumers of fashion will go only so far in the name of self-expression. Well-heeled shoppers, the sort who turn up at Barneys, might crave things they feel are unique, but ultimately they don't want to look radically different from their tribe.
That is something Mr. Silver, the Decades owner, seemed to understand well as he tried to stock the Barneys boutique with a spree at the Metropolitan Vintage Show in January. Python coats called to mind any number of recent designer collections, so he bought them. Bell-sleeve fur jackets with oversize buttons did not, and he avoided them. A Pierre Cardin shoulder bag with an enormous "C" on the front spoke to the current logo-obsessed moment. But it will never make it to Barneys. Donna Karan, one of the designers scouting for inspiration at the Metropolitan Show, bought it from Mr. Silver just after he returned to Los Angeles.
"I love Adrian suits," Mr. Silver said later, referring to an American designer of the 40's. "But if you wear one you're going to look like Joan Crawford."
Often, what dealers fail to sell tells as interesting a story as what they do sell. A few months ago, Ms. Lindholm, the dealer based in Cooks Falls, was offering a Chinese embroidered coat from the turn of the century in fine condition. Given that clothes that are 100 years old are not as easy to find as 25-year-old clothes, logic suggests that it might have been a hot property. No one was interested. When Ms. Lindholm posted a 17-year-old Betsey Johnson dress on eBay recently, she was shocked to see it sell instantly for $306. Of course, as anyone who followed the fall collections last month knows, the 80's are back.

HEADLINE: OFF THE SHELF;
And the Band Played On

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL; Alan Cowell is the London-based financial correspondent for The Times.

 BODY:
REMEMBER L.T.C.M.?
In September 1998, Long-Term Capital Management, the most notorious hedge fund of the late 20th century, was saved from the brink of collapse by a consortium of American, Swiss, German and British banks under the watchful eye of the Federal Reserve. Its capital is now reported to have fallen to less than $800 million. Its outstanding positions in the highly leveraged and often arcane derivatives markets stood at some $1.25 trillion. Its losses totaled $4.6 billion. The bailout cost $3.6 billion. 
 At the time -- hard on the heels of Russia's default -- it was widely thought that the teetering fortunes of this hedge fund, with its miraculous blend of the best minds of an academic generation and the smartest of Wall Street traders, threatened to pull down the global financial system with it.
In "Inventing Money" (John Wiley & Sons, $29.95), Nicholas Dunbar, a British financial journalist, tries to reconstruct what happened. But in recalling the panic and hype of the debacle, it seems to illuminate another lesson altogether.
The dogs have barked, as it were, but the caravan has moved on. The public outcry in Congress and elsewhere over the idea of a handful of multimillionaires being rescued from their own folly has faded. Thanks largely to Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, rapid-fire cuts in interest rates immediately after the bailout restored market confidence, and investors have since turned their attention to the hoped-for riches of the stock market and the New Economy.
If the conclusion to be drawn from the affair is that no money-making system, however brilliantly conceived, is immune to the unpredictability of the world beyond the trading floor, then the markets' subsequent behavior suggests that few people have taken it to heart. Greed, in other words, has no memory.
Of course, the near-collapse of Long-Term Capital was all the more riveting to outsiders for the size of the stakes, magnified by the huge amount of leverage -- borrowed money -- that the fund was using. And the reputations of the principal players -- the economists Robert C. Merton and Myron S. Scholes, whose work on options pricing won the Nobel in economics in 1997, along with the founder, John W. Meriwether, a former Salomon Brothers bond-trading wizard -- imparted a celebrity glamor to the fall. These were no faceless backroom characters, but the very icons of the market-driven 1990's, the magicians who had fused rocket science and the trading floor.
As the supposed masters of the universe stumble, brought low not so much by their own theories as by global events that no theory could foresee, the book reveals a certain Schadenfreude. Indeed, for the nonspecialist, Mr. Dunbar's study is at its best when it highlights ways that even the mightiest of financial institutions were blinded by a desire to clamber aboard a money-making machine returning more than 40 percent a year.
Consider Mathis Cabiallavetta, then the chairman of UBS, Switzerland's biggest bank. "For him, the pinnacle of Wall Street mystique was John Meriwether," Mr. Dunbar writes. That fascination was to cost UBS some $685 million, and Mr. Cabiallavetta his job.
Mr. Cabiallavetta's fate became a public event. But problematically for Mr. Dunbar, the principal figures at Long-Term Capital have largely avoided any public discussion of their role, and there is no sense in the book that the author was able to draw directly on in-depth interviews with them relating to events that brought the fund to its knees.
Consequently, much of the first two-thirds of "Inventing Money" is taken up with relating the history of markets, options and arbitrage, dating (a bit improbably) to the Code of Hammurabi and sweeping in, among other things, the study of physics in 19th century France and the growing alliance between Wall Street and American universities. It adds up to a substantial primer on the history of financial theory, not least because of Mr. Dunbar's knack for colorful parallels that illuminate his arguments.
AT the beginning, he quotes from Swift's "Gulliver's Travels," describing Laputa, "an island in the air, inhabited by men, who were able (as it should seem) to raise or sink, or put it into a progressive motion, as they pleased."
In a way, there is no further need for explanation, for that is exactly how Long-Term Capital was depicted by many outsiders at the time of its fall. Insiders, too: the partners who ran it and the supposedly hard-nosed bankers who backed it looked at the complex mathematical formulas for derivatives trading and thought they saw the alchemist's stone. And no wonder, since through the mid-1990's the fund almost effortlessly made its exclusive, already rich clientele even richer.
Why, then, did it unravel? Unlike his subject, which turned out to be concentrating risk instead of diffusing it, Mr. Dunbar hedges. One view, he says, is the "perfect storm" theory put out by the firm's partners, namely that a freak event wrecked "the world's most advanced trading vehicle."
The other is the "human folly" theory: "While L.T.C.M.'s own partners were reckless or misguided, the real reason L.T.C.M. became so big and dangerous was because the people running the investment banks were greedy and ignored the risks."
The truth is a mixture of the two theories, Mr. Dunbar writes. What is clear, he says, is that as the liquidity of the markets dried up in the late summer of 1998 after the Russian default, "everyone was trying to shut down or at least reduce the speed of the complicated money machines which had been exploiting discrepancies between bond, swap and options markets around the world."
But those same machines, Mr. Dunbar says, had become so big and were running so fast "that the sheer act of trying to shut them down made them blow up."

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Porsche StockIs a Play On Dot-Com Dreams

BYLINE: By JOANNE LEGOMSKY 

 BODY:
AN investor looking for an option on the bull market could have done worse than to buy the shares of Porsche A.G., the German automaker whose high-performance sports cars have become chariots of choice for dot-com millionaires.
Porsche's preference shares -- nonvoting ordinary shares -- have had a nice ride on the Frankfurt stock exchange, climbing 44.4 percent, annualized, for the three years through March 3, versus 14.1 percent for Germany's CDAX auto index. The voting shares are controlled by the Porsche and Piech families, including Ferdinand Piech, chairman of Volkswagen and a nephew of the founder, Ferdinand Porsche. 
 "I call this my dot-com play," said Glen Hilton, an auto analyst with Montgomery Asset Management.
Much of the power behind that rubber-burning run-up belongs to the Boxster roadster, introduced in late 1996. At $40,000, it was, for Porsche, an affordable sports car. The Boxster opened the Porsche market to younger, less affluent buyers -- without cannibalizing sales of the $65,000-plus Porsche 911.
In the fiscal year ended July 31, 1997, encompassing most of the first model year that the Boxster was available, overall Porsche unit sales climbed 68 percent, to 32,383. Fully 15,786 of those were Boxsters. Unit sales rose to 43,982 in fiscal 1999.
Because of the increase in sales, pretax margins doubled last year, to 11.3 percent of sales, among the highest of any automaker.
And some experts say the American rollout last November of the premium-priced Boxster S, combined with the planned introduction in May of a premium 911 Turbo, will keep margins growing. The extra money that buyers pay for these racier models -- $8,000 to $15,000 for the Boxster S, and up to $50,000 for the 911 Turbo -- "flows straight to the bottom line," Mr. Hilton said, because incremental production costs are modest. He says Porsche shares, now at 2750 euros, could hit 4,000 euros within a year.
Dominic Baker, a manager of the Munder Framlington International Growth fund, which holds the stock, said he expects earnings to grow at least 25 percent a year, on average, over the next few years. Porsche is a model of German efficiency, Mr. Baker said. He calculates, for example, that some 30 to 35 percent of the components in the Boxster and the 911 overlap.
Porsche enjoys other advantages, analysts say. Its contract engineering business, accounting for about 14 percent of sales, helps Porsche maintain the highly paid engineering team it otherwise could not afford. "The combination of the high-performance car business and engineering services is one of Porsche's strategic strengths," said Christian Breit sprecher, an analyst at Deutsche Bank.
And the strong dollar and buoyant American economy bode well, analysts say, because North America is Porsche's biggest market.
Moreover, although Porsche purists wince at the prospect, a sport utility vehicle planned for 2002 could add a third strong model to the lineup.
In the interim, some analysts say the 1.1 billion marks budgeted for development of the S.U.V. may slow earnings momentum. And some money managers and analysts say they are inclined to balk at that steep share price. Sabine Blumel, an analyst at Banca IMI in London, rates the stock a hold, saying that at 15 times her earnings estimate of 184.4 euros for next year, Porsche trades at a 65 percent premium to peer companies.
But Mr. Breitsprecher thinks the valuation is justified, saying Porsche's move to outsource some production in 1996 cut its capital requirements.

HEADLINE: Credit Cards at 50: The Problems of Ubiquity

BYLINE: By the Associated Press 

 BODY:
IN the 1950's, dapper men with mustaches and fedoras used them to settle their bills at Delmonico's, the "21" Club or the Copacabana. They were a novelty for the affluent and the urbane.
Today, consumers use them to buy nearly everything, from groceries to gasoline to psychic hotline calls, and not having one can be a significant handicap. But they have also been blamed for seducing millions of profligate spenders into crushing debt, and for opening a door to fraud and identity theft. 
 The credit card, an idea born 50 years ago when an absent-minded businessman dining out discovered that he had left his wallet elsewhere, now provides financial convenience for 157 million Americans, more than three-quarters of the adult population.
For Chantal de Jonge Oudraat of Washington, the cards' convenience means that when she flies on her frequent trips to Europe, she often takes less than $20 in cash. "There are two things I check before I go on a trip: my passport and plastic," she said.
Ms. de Jonge Oudraat, 43, generally carries five or six cards, about average for Americans, and uses her bank A.T.M. card to obtain local currency when she is overseas.
The first charge card is said to have appeared in February 1950. After dining at Major's Cabin Grill in Manhattan, Frank McNamara was embarrassed to discover that he had left his wallet in another suit. His wife paid the bill, but the experience left him thinking about a better solution.
At a later meal at Major's, Mr. McNamara presented a small cardboard card bearing his signature, which he called a diner's club card, and said he wanted to sign for the meal the way members at a private club do and be billed later. He was well known at Major's, and the restaurant decided to accept his idea. Encouraged, Mr. McNamara and his lawyer founded Diners Club, now owned by Citigroup.
The first card was offered to 200 people, mostly Mr. McNamara's friends and acquaintances. Fourteen Manhattan restaurants agreed to accept it. A year later, the company estimated that 42,000 Americans were carrying the card and that more than 330 businesses were accepting it. Membership cost $3 a year.
At first, all cards were charge cards, meaning that balances had to be paid in full each month. Revolving credit cards, which charge interest and allow customers to make partial payments each month, were introduced in 1951 in New York by Franklin National Bank, which eventually became European American Bank.
A half-century later, the simple charge card has a hundred variations. There are cards issued by individual retailers. There are affinity credit cards that earn frequent-flier miles or make donations to your favorite charity. There are various kinds of debit cards, like A.T.M. and check cards. There are cards with tiny ID photos or microchips imbedded for security. There are no-frills credit cards and, at the other end of the spectrum, a new super premium card from American Express with a $1,000 annual fee and all sorts of services.
Credit cards are hugely profitable for banks, in part because most interest rates on them average 18 percent, much higher than for most other consumer loans. As a result, card issuers stuff mailboxes with hundreds of millions of solicitations every year.
Today, almost as many people carry cards as have driver's licenses, and three times as many have cards as have valid passports. "Children, dogs, cats and moose are getting credit cards," the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, recently told the Senate Banking Committee.
CONSUMER GROUPS and other critics say heated competition has driven credit card companies to abusively aim marketing campaigns toward young people, especially college students.
About 70 percent of students at four-year colleges have at least one credit card, and revolving debt on those cards averages more than $2,000, according to a Georgetown University sociologist, Robert Manning, who has studied credit card debt among college students.
In the worst cases, he said, students are forced to drop out and work full time to pay off their debts. Some recent suicides by college students have been attributed to their despondency over mounting credit card debts.
There are other concerns:
* Federal regulators worry about a rise in risky lending by banks to people with poor credit histories. Subprime lending played a role in several bank failures last year, including BestBank of Boulder, Colo., which sold high-interest credit cards as part of a travel-club membership to consumers nationwide with inferior credit records. BestBank's failure drained some $232 million from the Federal Deposit Insurance fund.
* In recent months, there have been reports of large-scale breaches of credit card security on the Internet. After someone stole thousands of credit card numbers from the computers of CD Universe, an Internet music seller, in January, the industry saw what analysts called the largest mass cancellation of credit cards ever recorded.
* Visa and MasterCard, the two card networks that between them account for 75 percent of all transactions, are under legal attack on two fronts. The Justice Department has sued them, arguing that they do not really compete because both are effectively controlled by the same group of big banks; the case is due to be tried in June.
Separately, major retailers like Wal-Mart Stores are suing the two over their dominance of the debit card business, which retailers say has led to high transaction fees. Visa and MasterCard are contesting both suits, saying consumers can choose among cards from thousands of member banks competing not only against rival brands but also among themselves by offering different rates, credit limits and other features.
The credit card industry has also spent millions lobbying for new legislation to make it harder for consumers to escape payment of credit card debts through personal bankruptcy. The number of bankruptcies filed annually has been rising steadily despite the boom economy -- in part, consumer advocates say, because so much easy credit is offered to so many people by the credit card industry and others.
The stakes are high. Unpaid balances for the 80 million households with credit card accounts now average $6,000 to $7,000, according to the Consumer Federation of America. Still, about 43 percent of consumers pay off their credit card balances every month, according to industry figures.
From Frank McNamara's first office on the 24th floor of the Empire State Building, credit cards fanned out and eventually arrived in the farthest reaches of the third world and on the Internet.
Alfred Bloomingdale, who succeeded Mr. McNamara as president of Diners Club, mused in a 1959 magazine interview: "Where will it end? I don't see any limits. I think someday you're going to be able to charge anything."

HEADLINE: On Smith Street, a Dream Made Real

BYLINE: By CHRIS ERIKSON 

 BODY:
SHORTLY after sundown on Dec. 9, a diner walked into Banania Cafe on Smith Street in Brooklyn, sat at a corner table and ordered oysters. Ten minutes later, the oysters, fried in cornmeal, arranged on a bed of celery root puree and dappled with a tomato-seed vinaigrette, arrived from the kitchen. They were placed in front of the man, Joseph Gannascoli, who ate them and pronounced them "sublime."
If it was the most mundane of transactions between eater and eatery, one played out millions of times each day. It was also a milestone for Danforth Houle, the bistro's chef and owner. 
 Mr. Gannascoli was the first customer on Banania's opening day, and in serving him, Mr. Houle inched closer to the realization of a dream he has had since his teens, to run his own restaurant.
This dream prompts hundreds of people to try their luck each year in New York City's high-stakes restaurant marketplace, braving staunch competition, Herculean labor demands and daunting odds. With the city's economy humming, more hopefuls than ever are throwing their hats into the ring. The 2000 Zagat Survey, which tracks only a small fraction of the city's restaurants, noted 274 openings in 1999, more than 5 a week. If industry averages hold true, at least two-thirds of those will close or change hands within two years.
If each new restaurant represents a considerable risk of time and capital, it is also an act of creation involving a thousand small decisions about food, decor and atmosphere.
"A restaurant is a compendium of choices that the owner has made," says Danny Meyer, owner of the top-rated Union Square Cafe and Gramercy Tavern. "If you look around a restaurant, everything represents a choice: the kind of salt shaker that's on the table, the art on the walls, the uniforms on the waiters."
This was certainly true for Mr. Houle, who by the time he served his first customer had invested countless hours doing everything from scouting a location and planning a menu to varnishing tables and choosing napkins.
The undertaking required not only slavish attention to detail, but also an inexhaustible supply of time, patience and energy. Not to mention a sense of humor and a deft hand with a screw gun.
 
Another Opening, Another Postponement
It's a brisk day in October, an odd time to be thinking of air-conditioning, but Dan Houle is taking no chances. You never know when you might hit a warm spell, he says, so he's on his cell phone, dickering over costs and schedules.
His opening, once set for Nov. 2, has been pushed back another week, and judging by the restaurant's condition, that's not a bad thing. Sawdust and wood scraps litter the floor, the windowless front of his 800-square-foot space at 241 Smith Street in Carroll Gardens is boarded up, and the kitchen is an obstacle course of unconnected appliances.
Mr. Houle has been here since January, held up for much of that time by cash flow troubles. He had spent well over a year combing Manhattan for a site suitable for the restaurant he had in mind, one combining a bistro's casual atmosphere and moderate prices with innovative cuisine.
"I'd literally crisscross the city block by block, from Columbus Avenue down to TriBeCa," recalls Mr. Houle, a squat, muscular 34-year-old, typically dressed in jeans and sneakers, with earrings and a near-shaved head. "I'd write down numbers and call them from a pay phone. If I saw a closed door, I'd knock on it. I had no shame."
He was at his wits' end when a friend suggested Smith Street, which young chefs have transformed into a thriving restaurant row in the last two years. He found a corner spot for under $3,000 a month, far less than he'd pay in Manhattan.
There was a catch. The space was a wreck. Unable to afford a general contractor, Mr. Houle, who grew up around the building trades -- his father is a mason, his stepfather a contractor -- lined up help and went to work. He hired a motley crew of various nationalities and offbeat temperaments. But they're a good bunch, he said, and "they're willing to work with me if the money is short."
Which, at the moment, it is. As he inches toward his opening, Mr. Houle's finances are stretched to the breaking point. Separated from his wife of six months, he's sleeping at a friend's apartment, running up his credit card debt and eating on a few dollars a day. Expenses pile up: a walk-in refrigerator, a handpainted sign, a $3,000 espresso machine. "This is crunch time," he says. "When the details start coming in and the money starts flying out, it adds up. It's like holding your breath and going under water."
 
Born to Work in a Kitchen
Mr. Houle grew up on Cape Cod and got his first restaurant job at 15, spending his high school years cleaning toilets and peeling garlic six afternoons a week. At 16, he had a set of keys and was going in on Saturdays to make the sweet rolls himself.
After college and the Army, he worked at various jobs, among them bouncer and shellfisherman. But nothing clicked, and he felt directionless, until he realized that he really wanted to be behind a stove.
"The kitchen was the only place I ever felt really comfortable," he says. "To me it felt like one of the few places where you can be whoever you are."
He enrolled at the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y., graduated with honors and plunged into the competitive restaurant world, enduring back-stabbing co-workers, hotheaded superiors, long hours and slave wages while working at top restaurants: the River Cafe, Bouley, and the SoHo bistros Jean-Claude and Caffe Lure. The owner of these last two, Jean-Claude Iacovelli, became a mentor, teaching Mr. Houle how to manage a restaurant and serve three-star food at bistro prices.
He put the lesson to use in his next venture, when he and a partner opened an Upper West Side bistro, Savann. He created a menu akin to what he would serve at Banania: contemporary French food with a smattering of global influences and a reliance on vegetable reductions and infused oils rather than butter and cream sauces. Savann was a success, attracting critical praise and enthusiastic crowds, but the partnership foundered. Mr. Houle left, determined to make it on his own.
That is how he has come to be wedged into a basement staircase, screw gun in hand, tacking up drywall on the afternoon of Nov. 6. Banania has an investor, Mr. Iacovelli's brother, Stephane, but Mr. Houle maintains control over the operation.
This was to be opening week, but he's nowhere close. The walk-in refrigerator has just been finished and the pay phone installed, but the air-conditioner is not. It costs $10,000 that Mr. Houle doesn't have. (He declined to say how much he invested in Banania, but he said an owner could expect to pay more than $100,000 to open this sort of restaurant.) A more serious problem is that he still doesn't have gas and hot water, and a feud between the plumber and the landlord has progress at a standstill. His carpenter has been arrested for assault, and his handyman, who is said to have hit the numbers, is nowhere to be found.
At week's end, the deadlock with the plumber is unresolved, and as workers from the soda supplier run lines to the bar, Mr. Houle and his landlord, Howard Solins, commiserate in the basement. Mr. Solins says the buzz on Smith Street is so strong that two dozen restaurateurs have expressed interest in renting the space. He said he chose Mr. Houle not only because of his resume, but also because he was impressed by the chef's drive to succeed.
"I know how difficult the restaurant business is," Mr. Solins says. "I thought that Dan had the ability to bring something in that he was going to nourish and watch over like a dog. There are so many details you have to look after."
By the next week, there is still no gas or hot water. But the dining room is shaping up. Mr. Houle envisioned a warm bistro atmosphere, and to that end, he has outfitted the dining room with a cream-colored tin ceiling, polished copper wainscoting, racks for magazines and newspapers, beige stucco walls lined with wine bottles, and a huge mirror covering the rear wall. Near the front was a cartoonish painting of a grinning man, the logo of Banania (pronounced ba-NAH-nya), the French hot chocolate drink from which restaurant takes its name. A few touches are to come: Tin-Tin figurines, a blackboard for specials.
 
Going for Warm and a Bit Hip
"I didn't want it clutter-filled, with too many tchotchkes and posters on the wall," Mr. Houle says. "At the same time, I didn't want it harsh and masculine. I wanted it warm. Not trendy, but a little bit hip."
He walked a similar line writing the menu. Wary of anything that smacked of pretense, he wanted to avoid sounding precious. He wanted the menu studded with what he called "ding words," items with built-in appeal that jump out at the reader. "Spring roll" is a ding word, as is "sweet and sour."
Mr. Houle's prices are deliberately low. Many new places on Smith Street like Saul and the Grocery have entrees up to $18 or $19, but his most expensive item is steak frites at $15. The industry standard is that food costs are 32 percent of a dish's price, but with gentle pressure from Mr. Iacovelli, he's aiming for less of a margin, hoping to make up for it in volume.
"I tell him, 'It's a neighborhood place, it's very important to work with the neighborhood,' " Mr. Iacovelli says. "You have to respect the customer's money. You sell him an entree for $12, $13, the customer knows you respect him, and he'll come back."
A standard formula is that a restaurateur can break even if he fills each seat once every night, says Mr. Houle, whose place seats close to 60. But even restaurants packing in customers can run into financial problems given the expenses: utilities, insurance, garbage collection, exterminators, licensing fees, taxes. Linen bills can be a killer; at Savann they ran $1,200 a month. Employee theft is a chronic problem.
"There are so many ways money can leak out of a restaurant," Mr. Houle says. "There are many, many expenses beyond what people see, and those are the things that can kill a place. A restaurant can be packed all the time and barely breaking even."
The prudent owner must keep a constant eye on wastefulness. "For a restaurant owner, the garbage is an excellent place to look," Mr. Houle says by way of example. "Silverware goes into the garbage, or plates wrapped up in the tablecloths. People might be throwing out the ends of herbs that they don't feel like chopping. This stuff adds up."
It's Nov. 20, and while the gas stalemate has been resolved, permits are needed, and progress is mired in paperwork and bureaucratic inertia. Mr. Houle has been working endless days, making business calls in the morning, looking after construction all day, and working on the computer at night: creating work schedules, calculating his linen needs, and deciding which of his handful of employees is responsible for each task, from frying oysters to filling salt shakers. The staff -- a mix of people referred by Mr. Iacovelli and colleagues Mr. Houle has come to know over the years -- is in place, taking care of one potential headache.
 
Cuisine Is in the Details
While the grind is wearing him down, he's determined to push ahead to his opening, now set for Dec. 1. By the end of Thanksgiving week, things are in decent enough shape that it's time to outfit the restaurant. On Sunday he heads for a restaurant supply store on the Bowery for the hundreds of items he needs: a five-quart mixer, trash cans, knives and cutting boards, whisks and tongs, pliers for deboning fish, a giant colander, saute pans, an 80-quart stockpot that is two feet across. On the way to the cash register, two last-minute items are selected, a $50 mop bucket and a "No Spitting" sign for the kitchen.
A last hurdle remains: the liquor license. It's one of a laundry list of permits that every restaurateur needs, along with approvals from the Health, Building, and Fire Departments. Months earlier, Mr. Houle had filled out a 30-page application detailing his sources of financing, and his fingerprints were taken. He has been conditionally approved, but he doesn't have the license.
 Tuesday morning he goes to the State Liquor Authority office near City Hall. Permit in hand, he says, he'll open in two days. Given the state of the restaurant, where sawdust and tools cover the floor and pots are stacked in boxes, that seems ambitious. But, he says, chaos is the norm in the restaurant business.
"Mistakes are going to happen," he says. "But there's a prevailing attitude in the restaurant business. It gets done, somehow or another."
Finally his name is called and he gets his license. "I want to scream I'm so happy," he says. The only question now is one that has haunted every restaurateur before the opening: Will anyone show up?
"You can have all the right ingredients, and have everything going in the right direction, and still fail," he says. "It happens often in this city. You just have to have the right stuff, a combination of ambience, food and service, and throw in a pinch of luck. You just don't know."
It is Wednesday night, the eve of the opening. Standing under the glowing light fixtures, Mr. Solins is exultant. "It's the most alive-looking place on the street," he says, as passers-by peer through the window. Music pulses in the dining room, and the kitchen is humming with activity as pomegranates are juiced, fennel is sliced, and a giant pot of lamb stock bubbles on the stove. Decked out in chef's whites, Mr. Houle looks charged and happy. His 5 o'clock shadow is gone, and with it the patina of fatigue that surrounded him in recent weeks. He cooks until after midnight, then spends two hours ordering food.
By noon on Thursday, small gaps in the planning are starting to become evident. Mr. Houle realizes he forgot to order bread, and after striking out at the bakery next door, he gets on the phone and secures an emergency delivery. A beer order was likewise neglected, so he loaded his Volvo with a few cases of Heineken and Sam Adams. There's no corkscrew, so Mr. Houle sprints out in his chef's whites to fetch one.
At 2 p.m., it comes to his attention that there's no toilet paper or soap in the bathroom, and a waiter is dispatched. Meanwhile Mr. Houle, who had learned the night before that the fish purveyor wouldn't deliver to Brooklyn until after 5 p.m., heads to Manhattan to pick up the fish delivery at Jean-Claude. When he gets there at 2:30, three hours before his opening, the fish still hasn't arrived. "I hate this," Mr. Houle says, pacing nervously. "This stress kills."
Ten minutes later, the fish arrives, wrapped in brown paper: cod, snapper, salmon, calamari, oysters. Mr. Houle pulls out a huge salmon and buries his nose in it. "Beautiful," he says. "This is sexy stuff."
 Back at the restaurant, candles are lighted at 5:15, and Mr. Houle and the Iacovelli brothers huddle. How many escargots in an order, Mr. Iacovelli asks. Seven, Mr. Houle answers. "That's fair," Mr. Iacovelli says. "Do you have forks or toothpicks?"
The first customer, Mr. Gannascoli, arrives at 5:30, and Mr. Houle works carefully but quickly, ringing a bell as each dish is finished and examining the plates as they return to the kitchen, a habit he learned from David Bouley. They're spanking clean, a good sign.
At 6:30, a pair of young women come in; half an hour later, two more. By 7:30, people are arriving steadily, and at 9 two dozen diners fill the space with a conversational buzz. The menu in the window seems to exert a magnetic pull. Few pass by without stopping to examine it. As the night goes on, the reviews come in, and the word is good. Mr. Gannascoli says he is "moved." Renee Ryerson, who shared the red snapper with her friend Karen Lichtenstein, calls it "amazing," and praises the presentation and the moderate prices. Juventino Avila, a chef who lives a block away, calls it the best meal he has had in weeks.
There were complaints; one couple found the service lacking, another thought the menu confusing. But Holly Merry and Maureen Brennan, who came in for a glass of wine and left planning to return soon, were more typical.
Despite the praise and the lack of catastrophes, at the end of the night, after 40 people have been fed, the atmosphere feels less like a celebration than a rolling up of the sleeves. As the kitchen is cleaned and food wrapped and stored, Mr. Houle, who has a large burn on his forearm, gripes a bit. An illegible order led to a mistake, and some of the music had loud, pounding bass lines.
Still, he's generally satisfied, he says, as he rummages through the garbage. Sure enough, he finds a ladle, pan lids and a handful of napkins. Then he phones to order food for the next day; lemon grass, a case of blood oranges, goat cheese, lamb shanks.
 
Problems but No Disasters
The last table leaves at midnight. Candles are blown out and money is counted. "I think he did pretty well," Jean-Claude Iacovelli says. Nobody wait too long for the appetizer, nobody wait too long for the main course. Everybody was happy."
"When you do 40 covers, it's easy," he says. "Tomorrow and Saturday it'll get busier. When you get a rush, that's when the trouble starts."
The weekend passes without a disaster, though not without problems. Friday the dishwasher fails to show, but Mr. Houle has a replacement in an hour. Saturday afternoon the boiler goes out, and is restarted only half an hour before opening. A misunderstanding with the garbage haulers lets trash pile up beside the building. But 75 to 80 people come each night, and everyone is fed.
In the next month, the number of diners begins to climb. Soon Banania is pulling well over 100 people for dinner on weekend nights, and when brunch service starts just before Christmas, the response is huge. Expecting to serve 50 people, Mr. Houle is taken aback by an onslaught of customers.
As January progresses, the restaurant gets busier, and soon lines are forming on weekends. Brunch in particular is a madhouse, with a steady crowd of people waiting for tables. At the end of the month, Eric Asimov gives Banania a generally favorable review in The New York Times, and the lines get longer still.
As January moves into February and March, things are looking good for Cafe Banania. But if there's one thing that restaurateurs agree on, it's that success only brings the need to work harder.
"You've got to constantly look at every aspect of the operation and ask how you can do it better," Danny Meyer says. "It's like Bill Parcells used to say when he was coach of the Giants: there's no such thing as maintaining excellence. You're either getting better or you're getting worse."
Mr. Houle, working 14 hours a day, seven days a week to nurture his offspring, believes he's up to the job. While satisfied, he sees a lot of room to grow. A sidewalk cafe in the warm months, maybe a raw bar.
"Some people make it and move on," he said. "I don't want to do that. I want to stay here and polish the diamond. I want it to be one of those places you see where it's always busy, always packed; a place that people like to walk into, and they're happy when they leave. I've worked all my life to do this.
"To stop short, why would I do that?"

HEADLINE: MARKET INSIGHT;
Sure, Banks Are Down, But Maybe Not Out

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN 

 BODY:
IN a stock market that, except for technology stocks, has developed a decidedly bitter edge, regional banks are among the groups that taste the worst.
Since last May 13, the Standard & Poor's index of major regional banks has declined by nearly 40 percent. For the most part, the decline does not reflect poor performance at the banks themselves. While the banks do not have the growth rates, say, of dot-coms, they are out there making money in a strong economy, and their balance sheets are in good shape. 
 According to the stock market, which tends to have a forward look, all of that is going to change sharply for the worse. But Thomas K. Brown, chief executive of Second Curve Capital, a financial services research and money management firm in Manhattan, has a rosier view. Last week, he took some time to discuss what may happen later this year. Following are excerpts from the conversation:
 
Q. The slide in regional bank stocks really started to accelerate after the Federal Reserve started pushing up interest rates. Have investors become too pessimistic?
 
A. We look at three measures: price-earnings ratios relative to the S. & P. 500 index, bank dividend yields relative to the S. & P. 500, and relative price-to-book ratios.
Today, with or without the technology component of the S. & P. 500, those valuation measures are at extremes. In terms of relative prices, bank stocks have never been more attractive. And relative yields are higher than they were in 1990, when banks were cutting dividends.
The stock prices are telling you we will go through an environment that is comparable to 1980, when we had an unprecedented increase in short-term interest rates on top of a recession, or in 1990, when we were going through a general recession and a real estate depression.
There is a risk that might happen, but the probability that it will happen is low.
 
Q. In your view, what is a more likely prospect for the economy?
 
A. I have a high degree of confidence the Fed will be successful in slowing the economy without tipping it into recession. It is just a question of how many interest rate increases it will take to accomplish that.
When the market sees they are achieving that goal, there will be an incredible cyclical rally in bank stocks. I think that will happen sometime in the next six months.
 
Q. What if you are wrong, and the market is right, that the Fed will tighten too much and push the economy into recession. Do the bank stocks have a further downside?
 
A. We would see lower prices from today's levels. But I don't think the downside risk is more than 20 percent.
 
Q. With the whole group at such a low market valuation, some banks have started looking at making acquisitions. Just last week, North Fork Bancorp made a hostile $1.8 billion bid for Dime Bancorp. Would a wave of new mergers and acquisitions set off a rally in the stocks?
 
A. That's not possible. There have been too many failed deals for both shareholders and the buyers over the last three years to make the market excited about mergers. Investors have been burned too many times.
A more likely scenario, in my view, is that the rally in financial stocks will come first, and that will trigger a wave of consolidation. There is a perception among buyers and sellers that there is a need to do something this year, because pooling-of-interest accounting methods will no longer be available in 2001.
But if there is no rally in financial stocks, there will not be a consolidation wave.
 
Q. Are there any potential mergers out there that you think make a great deal of sense?
 
A. You could do a great deal with Banc One. At its current market price of around $21 a share, you could do a great deal by offering $40. I could make an argument that if Citigroup did that deal, it would be terrific, because it is a terrific fit for both franchises.
 
Q. Which stocks do you like at this juncture?
 
A. We like a number of thrifts, which are trading at much lower prices now than they were a year ago.
One company we like is Golden State Bancorp. The stock is trading at less than five times this year's earnings. The company has a great management team, which has done a great job historically of running and selling savings and loans.
We also like Washington Mutual and Greenpoint Financial. These are not riskless investments, and they are not having a great first quarter. And we like TCF Financial.
 
Q. What about banks?
 
A. National City Corporation, US Bancorp, First Star and Wells Fargo are all cheap stocks and are all good banks. And we like Capital One and Providian among the consumer finance companies.

HEADLINE: Gore's Achilles' Heel

BYLINE: By Floyd H. Flake; Floyd H. Flake, a former Democratic Congressman, is the pastor of the Allen A.M.E. Church in Queens.

 BODY:
Now that Al Gore has locked up his party's nomination for president, it's time for him to start thinking beyond his loyal Democratic base. How can he appeal to independent voters?
He should take a page from President Clinton. In the 1992 campaign, Mr. Clinton made welfare reform a paramount issue, which helped him reach out beyond his party and win the votes of moderates. His political astuteness enabled him to craft legislation that both Republicans and Democrats agreed on in 1996. This will be a lasting legacy of his administration. 
 Al Gore could do for education what his boss did for welfare. In polls during the primaries, voters consistently said that education was their foremost concern. Promising to reform the education establishment would give Mr. Gore a means of building a broad base of support.
But Mr. Gore has not picked up this mantle. He has not embraced school choice, which offers vouchers and charter schools to lower middle class parents, giving them the chance to get their children out of failing schools. Choice brings the discipline of the market to our stagnant school systems.
Instead, Mr. Gore has chosen to win the support of the teachers' unions, which have stubbornly opposed almost all innovation. But this strategy comes at a price. Mr. Gore sacrifices the support of a powerful combination of advocates. Market economists like Milton Friedman find themselves on the same side as common-sense community activists, black Baptist preachers and those tired of empty promises from entrenched special interests.
Al Gore may have to contend with this potent bloc in the general election. A preview came at the Democratic candidates' debate in Harlem last month, when Tamala Edwards, a writer for Time, challenged Mr. Gore on education reform. With "what's good for the goose is good for the gander" clarity, Ms. Edwards asked about Mr. Gore's opposition to school choice, in light of his own decision to exercise school choice for his family. (All his children have gone to private schools.)
Ms. Edwards asked why Mr. Gore had not sent his children to the same public schools he defended, the schools where millions of poor and lower middle class people have no choice but to send theirs.
Mr. Gore didn't answer her question in any real way. That won't do. He and other Democrats must seriously address the disparities that exist in public education. If they don't, they face losing the interest of their most faithful constituency: African-Americans.
Al Gore might think he has the African-American vote in his back pocket. But George W. Bush's call for education reform could pose a challenge. After all, African-Americans want good schools for their children, yet they have the hardest time gaining entry to them.
In March, the Applied Research Center in Oakland, Calif., reported that minority students in urban communities suffer big disadvantages because of lack of access to good schools. This shocking report comes 46 years after the Brown v. Board of Education decision that ended racial segregation.
If Mr. Gore is going to pluck the heartstrings of the African-American community -- and of middle America at large -- he is going to have to answer why what is good for the Gores is not good for families with less power and wealth.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW;
Productivity Finally Shows The Impact Of Computers

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE 

 BODY:
SINCE the early 1970's, the standard of living of most Americans has risen at a snail's pace. Are the gains finally coming faster?
That is really another way of asking whether the productivity of the nation's workers, which has risen at a snail's pace, has now finally shifted into a higher gear. And the tentative answer is yes -- the remarkable economic boom since 1995 has at last brought an enduring improvement in the output of goods and services for each hour spent on the job. 
 Don't rush out and borrow against the national good fortune. We have not entered into a New Economy in which computers, the Internet and fancy information technology shower efficiencies and prosperity reminiscent of the 1960's. Their effect is less dazzling, according to the most sober new studies. But the improvement is there. And the famous quip tossed off in 1987 by Robert M. Solow, the Nobel laureate in economics -- "You can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics" -- finally stands amended.
"You can now see computers in the productivity statistics," Mr. Solow said in an interview last week.
The most significant evidence comes in a soon-to-be-published research paper by Stephen D. Oliner and Daniel E. Sichel, two Federal Reserve economists.
In a landmark study five years ago, they looked into how computers contributed to labor efficiency and found little impact. That study threw cold water on the New Economy enthusiasts, who had argued that statistics showing productivity in the doldrums in those days were faulty.
Since then, the statistics have recorded a surge in the productivity growth rate. The enthusiasts no longer see so many flaws in the numbers. And Mr. Oliner and Mr. Sichel now find that computers -- both the manufacture of them and their use, particularly the large-scale networking of computers since 1995 -- are making a measurable contribution.
THEIR findings fall short of the New Economy, and do not match the enthusiasm of their boss, Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, whose recent public pronouncements put him close to the New Economy camp. The authors note that the annual rate of productivity growth has risen by more than one percentage point from the roughly 1.5 percent average from 1973 to 1995. But they decline to estimate how much of the improvement is temporary -- a result of companies straining to produce more while the boom lasts -- and how much will persist through the next recession.
Still, they are optimistic. "Information technology has been the key factor behind the improved productivity performance," Mr. Sichel and Mr. Oliner write, adding that "a sizable portion" will persist.
Productivity is a straightforward concept. It rises when a long-distance telephone operator, for example, handles three more calls an hour this year than last. A result is more toll revenue for the same labor cost, increasing profits or wages or both. If enough finds its way into wages across the economy, living standards rise, as they have since 1995, although profits have absorbed much of the gains.
The productivity improvement is strongest in manufacturing, especially of computers and semiconductors. And the statistics reflect a bonus beyond the combination of labor and new equipment: the efficiencies that result from the way people work. All these factors account for two-thirds of the increase in the growth rate, Mr. Sichel and Mr. Oliner write. There have been surges in productivity growth before, but none in which information technology played so big a role.
The added wages and profits that flow from all this will last if the productivity improvement is permanent -- a result of more efficient equipment, for instance, rather than an operator straining to keep up with a rising workload in a booming economy.
Efficiency, however, is not enough to sustain productivity. There is a demand side to the equation. The productivity growth rate gets whittled away if customers fail to buy all the additional goods and services generated with every hour of work.
And then there is the capital spending aspect. Responding to the tremendous demand of the last four years, companies have raised capital spending to record levels. This spending, in turn, is a major contributor to the surge in productivity.
Mr. Oliner and Mr. Sichel reflect these caveats in their new study, which is why their research is likely to be a benchmark in the continuing debate over American prosperity. Or as Mr. Solow put it, "I will feel better about the endurance of the productivity improvement after it survives its first recession."

HEADLINE: The Metamorphosis Of Germany Inc.

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: MUNICH

 BODY:
AS chairman of Allianz A.G., the German insurance conglomerate with $370 billion in assets under management, Henning Schulte-Noelle is about as close as anybody to the heart of Germany Inc.
Far more than just an insurance company, Allianz is at the center of a web of cross-holdings and interlocking directorates that have made German industry a seemingly impenetrable fortress for decades. 
 From his bland five-story headquarters building here, Mr. Schulte-Noelle controls sizable stakes in this country's most powerful corporations: Deutsche Bank, Dresdner Bank, Siemens, Bayer and BASF, to name just a few.
Yet as he relaxed briefly in his office on Thursday, Mr. Schulte-Noelle not only acknowledged that the old system was crumbling, but also said he planned to swing the hammer himself.
"The dismantling is obvious," he said, without a trace of regret. "After the Second World War, Germany needed to be rebuilt, and we obviously needed a cohesive system. Everybody had to be part of it. Now, indeed, we are in the process of changing."
That is not idle talk. In the last few months, the structure and ethos underlying Fortress Germany have begun to crack like a house on a California fault line.
The most stunning evidence came last week, when Allianz brokered a $30 billion merger deal between Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank. What at first blush looks like simple retreat to corporate giantism is in reality a major step toward dismantlement.
Not only will the new Deutsche Bank spin off its entire retail banking business as an independent company, but Allianz and Deutsche Bank plan to steadily reduce their stakes in each other -- and, ultimately, unwind all of their mutual cross-holdings.
Even that is just a start. Thanks to a radical tax plan that will allow corporations to sell off investments without paying capital gains taxes, German banks and insurers are now salivating at the prospect of divesting industrial holdings accumulated decades ago and now worth more than $100 billion.
Those sales will essentially unravel Germany's corporate safety net. And they will come precisely as conglomerates across Europe are engaged in a frenzy of mergers, acquisitions and spinoffs aimed at bolstering shareholder value.
A result is that old loyalties are dissolving. Not long ago, hostile takeovers were taboo. One month ago, Vodafone AirTouch P.L.C. of Britain won its battle to acquire Mannesmann A.G. of Germany for $183 billion -- the biggest hostile takeover anywhere, ever.
At the same time, Germans' willingness to take on risk has undergone a revolution.
As recently as 1997, young companies in technology industries had no chance of raising money through public stock offerings in Germany. Now more than 200 companies are listed on the Frankfurt exchange's New Market, and their combined value has soared to $220 billion.
The breakup of Germany Inc. has reached deep into the national fabric. American and British companies are scouring for acquisitions among Germany's vast mittelstand, or middle class, of smaller family-owned industrial companies.
Time-honored notions of career success are falling by the wayside, too. University graduates who once sought lifelong careers at prestigious companies are defecting to entrepreneurial start-ups. Stock options and golden parachutes, both nonexistent three years ago, are the rage.
It all sounds like the United States 10 or 15 years ago, and most experts are convinced that the changes are healthy. German companies are becoming more competitive, more flexible and more innovative. Young entrepreneurs have become national heroes.
But to many Germans, it is a shock. Tens of thousands of union workers protested fiercely against Vodafone's bid for Mannesmann. But they were equally shocked to learn afterward that Mannesmann's chief executive had a severance package worth $30 million.
Corporate executives have been jolted, as well. Two years ago, Deutsche Bank executives were dumbfounded when the American investment bankers they had recruited with huge pay packages defected abruptly to a rival -- for even bigger packages.
And the fear of takeovers and job cuts is relentless. Bayerische Motor Werke, the Bavarian car manufacturer, has been the topic of unending takeover speculation, despite the insistence of its controlling shareholders, the Quandt family, that the company should remain independent.
Few remarks capture the new spirit as well as a recent one by Gerhard Cromme, chief executive of Thyssen Krupp, Germany's biggest steel company.
As head of what was then the Krupp Group, Mr. Cromme shocked Germans in 1997 by starting a hostile bid for Thyssen. Pelted with eggs by union workers, Mr. Cromme soon found himself under attack by the then chancellor, Helmut Kohl. But Mr. Cromme ultimately prevailed, hammering out a friendly merger deal that has proved quite successful.
Yet when he appeared at a conference on mergers last month, Mr. Cromme sounded almost alarmed as he considered the implications of America Online's recent deal to acquire Time Warner.
"This can happen to everybody -- even those of us with big market capitalizations," he said. "Internet companies can buy up whatever they want in the world, and it's really something we have to think about."
 
New Path at Deutsche Bank
Sheathed in reflective glass, the twin towers that house the Frankfurt headquarters of Deutsche Bank project both gravitas and power.
Today, Deutsche Bank is the biggest shareholder in DaimlerChrysler, with 12 percent of the shares. Its portfolio of industrial holdings is worth about $20 billion. Its executives serve on the supervisory boards of more than a dozen big corporations.
Yet ever since he took over as the bank's chief executive in 1997, Rolf-Ernst Breuer has been preoccupied with breaking up these old ties.
"We lived with the old model of Germany Inc. very successfully over the last 50 years," he said in a recent interview. "But in a globalized environment, you have no chance to pursue an island model -- and it was an island model. It was very German."
Even before the Dresdner deal, Deutsche Bank towered over any German competitor. But investors assign it a value far below that of America Online -- or, perhaps more relevantly, the discount broker Charles Schwab. Despite the immense size of Deutsche Bank, its return on equity of about 9.9 percent compares poorly with the 15 percent earned by many American rivals. So in the new world, Mr. Breuer knows his bank is vulnerable.
"We have to ask ourselves: What is the reason?" he said. "What can we do about getting a better market capitalization?"
Mr. Breuer has begun answering the question by leading Deutsche Bank's systematic retreat from Germany Inc. He has prohibited bank executives from heading the supervisory boards of companies in which it holds significant stakes. Last year, he split off the bank's industrial holdings into a separate company that could be managed more actively. In a big move last fall, Deutsche Bank sold off more than $1 billion of Allianz shares -- the first step toward untangling the two companies.
But all that was a mere prelude. Just before Christmas, Chancellor Gerhard Schroder proposed eliminating capital gains tax for companies selling shares in other corporations. Now Deutsche Bank plans to reshuffle its holdings from top to bottom -- and cash in a big chunk of the gains it has accrued over the course of Germany's post-war boom.
Almost every other company with such a portfolio is doing the same. At Allianz, Mr. Schulte-Noelle hired the head of the Frankfurt office of Goldman Sachs, Paul Achleitner, as his new chief financial officer. Allianz has already swung into action, selling $1.5 billion of bonds, convertible into Allianz's shares in Siemens A.G. Much deal-making is expected as other stakes are disposed of.
At Deutsche, Mr. Breuer plans to turn the profits from his stock sales into Internet projects, which could consume more than $1 billion a year. In a separate move, Deutsche Bank is planning to reduce its stake in the German stock exchange, which plans to go public later this year.
"Saying goodbye to Germany Inc. is a process which is not very easy," Mr. Breuer said. "It served us well, but more and more it gave rise to criticisms -- especially from the side of Anglo-Saxon observers who said there was an ongoing conflict of interest."
Once upon a time, those criticisms could have been brushed aside, and a case made for the strong growth, full employment and social stability that Germany's cozy economic cocoon afforded. Not anymore, given the way German industry, with its high costs and consensual decision-making, fell behind the re-engineered economies of the United States and Britain.
"It developed into a competitive disadvantage," Mr. Breuer said.
 
Invasion in the Heartland
Beru A.G., a small company with headquarters near Stuttgart that makes glow plugs for diesel engines, seems a world away from takeover brawls and American-style high finance. But a fax delivered to Beru's chief executive, Ulrich Ruetz, offered a tough lesson in how mobile money can be.
The message was from a representative of the Carlyle Group, a corporate buyout group based in Washington. It informed Mr. Ruetz that Carlyle's subsidiary in Munich would like to buy his company for about $30 a share, or about $300 million.
That was startling enough. The real shocker was this: Carlyle had already cut a deal with two of Beru's four founding families to buy 26.25 percent of the stock.
"It bothered me that they didn't even let us know before they came to us," Mr. Ruetz said. "It is hardly how I would have made a friendly approach."
At the moment, the outcome is undecided. The other founding families, which control 29 percent of the shares, say Carlyle will have to raise its offer before they sell out. Public shareholders, who own the rest, have not yet been approached. For Carlyle's part, Michael Hildisch, director of the firm's Munich office, said its partners were interested only in friendly deals. "We want management to be on board," he said.
Whatever happens, the case is evidence of how, with little attention, a flood of foreign money is aiming at Germany's mittelstand, the family-controlled industrial companies that make ball bearings, engine casings, automobile seats and water pumps.
A few of these companies, like Beru, are listed on the stock exchange, even though family members retain majority control. Most are entirely private, largely inscrutable to outsiders.
But private or public, the mittelstand companies have become hot properties. Carlyle, which set up a $1 billion buyout fund for Europe in 1997, has a permanent subsidiary in Munich. Other American and British buyout companies are looking for deals in Germany, too.
So are foreign industrial companies, particularly American automobile parts suppliers. Under heat from big car manufacturers to become faster, cheaper and more global, parts suppliers on both sides of the Atlantic are trying to consolidate.
Much like leveraged buyout funds operating in the United States, Carlyle has a goal of acquiring solid but sluggish manufacturers, sprucing them up and -- if all goes well -- selling the companies or taking them public for a big profit four or five years later.
"In most cases, the family members are very reluctant to sell," Mr. Hildisch acknowledged. But often, he said, companies realize that they cannot raise the capital for expansion on their own.
It took him nearly a year to negotiate the purchase of Honsel A.G., a company based near Dortmund that builds gearboxes and engine blocks and had sales of about 900 million marks, or about $450 million, last year. Carlyle finally acquired Honsel last fall for 300 million marks, or about $150 million. Now, Carlyle executives are acquiring a small American producer in the same field and have plans to merge it with Honsel.
Maximilian Dietzsch-Doertenbach, a consultant who advises family-owned German companies, says the vast horde of smaller companies badly need to raise capital but are shunned in the stock market as ugly ducklings.
"There are 5,600 auto suppliers in Germany, but only about 70 of them have sales of more than 500 million marks," Mr. Dietzsch-Doertenbach said. "These companies have to grow. They have to be more international. But what should they do? Sell out, which they don't like? Go public, when they know they won't be well received?"
Though entirely independent of the Carlyle Group, Mr. Dietzsch-Doertenbach argues that it and similar firms fill a crucial void. "The Carlyles of the world are very much needed," he said.
At Beru, in the little town of Ludwigsburg, Mr. Ruetz says his company does not need any outside help. Beru's sales last year climbed 12 percent to 426 million marks, about $218 million. Its net income climbed 29 percent to 37.3 million marks, or about $19.1 million.
But Mr. Ruetz is too realistic to dismiss Carlyle. In the stock market, diesel engine glow plugs are not as exciting as Internet companies. If Carlyle offers more money, he said, Beru might easily be sold: "It's all a question of price."
 
A High-Test Market Takes Off
 If the breakup of Germany Inc. has left Mr. Ruetz in a quandary, it is has made Thomas Haffa a billionaire.
Mr. Haffa and his brother Florian are co-founders of EM.TV A.G., an 11-year-old television and film company outside Munich that has acquired broadcasting rights to a huge collection of children's programs. Last month, Mr. Haffa made international news with a deal to acquire the Jim Henson Company and its Muppets for about $680 million.
But the most extraordinary aspect of Mr. Haffa's story is his rise in the German stock market. Until 1997, the restrictive rules of the Frankfurt exchange virtually prohibited new companies like EM.TV from going public. That reflected the mindset of Fortress Germany -- that a good company is a big company, and the best company is a very big, very old company.
"I had a lot of American friends who told me, 'Haffa, you have to go public,' " he recalled in an interview. "I said sure -- but where?"
The answer, it turned out, was Frankfurt. In 1997, the stodgy Deutsche Borse started a new exchange with far easier entrance rules called the Neue Markt, or New Market. EM.TV was one of the first companies to go public there.
In the three years since, the New Market has achieved dazzling success, listing more than 200 companies, most of them new enterprises based on innovative technology or new business concepts.
Mobilcom A.G., which started out as a scrappy marketing concern for cellular telephone services, was the first company to list on the New Market. Today, having expanded to compete directly against Germany's main telephone company in long-distance service, Mobilcom has a market value of more than $6 billion. So does Qiagen, a company that makes products used in biotechnology research.
But EM.TV has been the most spectacular success. The stock has soared more than 31,000 percent and has a total market value of $13 billion. Mr. Haffa, who spurns traditional German modesty about money and flaunts his yacht, owns nearly half the shares, along with other family members.
To be sure, the New Market may well reflect naive dreams and bubble valuations. But it has contributed in its own way to the dismantling of Germany Inc.
Thanks to its listed companies, stock options have changed the way thousands of German workers think about risk and reward. Options were nonexistent here three years ago, and they still are at many established companies. But at many New Market companies, including EM.TV, stock options are part of almost everyone's pay package.
Recruiters say older Germans are still more nervous than American or British executives about jumping to little-known technology companies. But young managers who would have stayed at an established company for life are now leaping at the age-old dream of getting in the ground floor.
"I have one opening for a chief financial officer at a messaging company, because it plans to go public," said Jurgen Rohrmayer, an executive recruiter at Kienbaum Consultants in Munich. "I have had an amazing number of senior financial officers applying -- and they are doing it over the Internet."
Now 44, Reto Francioni has nearly reached the pinnacle of the Deutsche Borse itself. As deputy chief executive, Mr. Francioni oversees most of the exchange's trading operations, including the New Market.
Yet Mr. Francioni, a Swiss citizen, has decided to bail out himself and join one of Germany's fastest growing Internet brokerage firms, Consors A.G.
"The question is, do you want to act as an entrepreneur, or do you want to join a big corporation?" Mr. Francioni said last week. "For me, the size of the company is not the issue. The issue for me is the opportunity for growth."
Despite his top position at the Deutsche Borse, Mr. Francioni receives no stock options at his current job. He will at his new one.

HEADLINE: Aiding the Neediest Cases

 BODY:
Perhaps the most striking thing about the Neediest Cases Fund drive is its diversity. The money gathered -- more than $6 million this year, second only to last year's record -- goes to help an extraordinary array of people, and it helps them in ways that specifically match their individual needs. Moreover, the drive reminds us that generosity takes as many forms as need itself. This is money raised in large amounts and small. It comes from people who can easily afford to give and from people whose giving makes a real difference in their own weekly budgets. The gifts are seldom thoughtless or offhanded. The money is given not so that we can dismiss from our minds the poor or the sick or the helpless but so that we can remember them.
We are all inured to charitable appeals and inundated by images of suffering. It can be hard, at times, to remember that they reflect an imbalance in human equity, an imbalance that is, unfortunately, one result of our prosperity. The impersonal forces of our growing economy have helped to lift many people out of poverty and suffering. But the neediest cases are precisely that. Their needs lie beyond the ordinary. The only relief prosperity will bring them comes from our prosperity, from the abundance we feel. 
 Your contributions, which are deductible on federal, state and city income taxes to the extent permitted by law, are still welcome. They go directly to seven charitable organizations: the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service; the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York; the Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens; the Children's Aid Society; the Community Service Society of New York; the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies; and the UJA-Federation of New York.

HEADLINE: The Mars and Venus Campaign

 BODY:
And so it has come to pass that after a short but electrifying primary election campaign, the choice for president in the year 2000 is between two attractive, earnest men of privilege who went into the family business of politics, and who probably first shouted at each other in the 1960's across a football stadium at a Yale-Harvard game. Voters yearning for someone who did not claw his way up like Bill Clinton should be pleased. The irony is that for all their similarities and their shared desire to command the center, Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore are waging a contest between two contrasting visions long familiar in American politics.
In his victory speech last week, Mr. Bush portrayed himself as the tribune of honor and the individual. He wants lower taxes, more money for the military and tough standards for schools combined with greater choice for parents. He would use some of the surplus to shore up Social Security, but replace it in part with a system of investment accounts. He portrays Mr. Gore as a loyal defender of the state for the solution to every problem, stifling freedom in the process. The vice president sees Mr. Bush, on the other hand, as a servant of the affluent and a candidate who would peel the state back from its proper role in securing the environment, schools and health. The state, for Mr. Gore, is not the enemy of the individual. It is there to nurture, protect and ensure that Americans are treated fairly, especially in their earliest years and old age. 
 These terms should be familiar by now. With their tailored suits and cowboy boots, the candidates may look alike and even talk alike. But as a couple, Mr. Bush is from Mars and Mr. Gore from Venus. Of course in marriage as in politics, especially in good times, Americans find some appeal in both visions. Mr. Bush is right that the individual and the entrepreneur are at the center of the American success story. But Mr. Gore is correct that the surpluses lying ahead offer an extraordinary opportunity to pay down the debt and soften the harsh inequities dealt by the economy.
The polls show the race to be close. But at the moment they show Mr. Gore as having the edge on the issues, especially on Social Security, health, schools and the environment. That means that Mr. Bush will have to flesh out what he means by the phrase "compassionate conservative" with more programmatic detail. On taxes, the governor is surely right to say that the $1 trillion surplus projected for the next 10 years belongs to the American taxpayers. But so does the $5.5 trillion federal debt, and the obligation to provide for basic social needs. Mr. Bush's speech after his big primary victories last Tuesday was notable for not mentioning anything about health care and the environment.
The governor also dwelled at length about honor, which he said had been "exiled" from the White House for nearly eight years. There was a theme of restoration about his address that will be appealing to many Americans after the years of scandals. It cannot help Mr. Gore to be reminded, as he was by recent news stories, of the failure of the Justice Department to investigate the campaign fund-raising abuses of 1996. But honor is a tricky issue. Senator John McCain drew voters to his cause because he had a record that no one could dismiss. Mr. Bush must overcome deep skepticism over whether the honor he stands for is deserved, especially after a campaign of scurrilous attacks and his own unrestrained fund-raising.
From their divergent positions, Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore will be looking for ways to portray themselves as men of the center and their opponents as from the fringes of this debate. Their records show them both to be more nuanced in their approach to government than the oratory suggests -- Mr. Gore as a fiscal conservative and budget-balancer, Mr. Bush as an advocate for more spending on education and poverty programs. In the end, however, the voters will probably decide which basic impulse about government makes the most sense for a nation that is prosperous and complacent, put forward by two men with backgrounds more similar than not.

HEADLINE: Rebutting a Critic of BID's

 BODY:

To the Editor:
In "Why BID's Are Bad Business" (Soapbox, Feb. 13), Moshe Adler seeks to concoct a case that the Downtown Alliance is somehow anti-commercial-tenant, anti-retailer and anti-worker by being pro-resident. This argument has about as much intellectual validity as does banging on the table.
When the Downtown Alliance began, a little more than five years ago, Lower Manhattan had almost 25 million square feet of vacant commercial space, was a one-dimensional 9-to-5, Monday through Friday commercial district and had lost 75,000 workers since the beginning of the last decade. 
 Today, thanks to a constructive partnership between the entire downtown community and government, Lower Manhattan is thriving once again. Property owners, commercial tenants, workers, retailers and restaurants, hotels, new residents and visitors all share in the benefits of a dramatically transformed neighborhood.
The Downtown Alliance's 40-person board of directors includes almost every conceivable interest. The local Community Board appoints 10 percent of the directors. Retailers, commercial tenants, nonprofit organizations and residents are well represented. And, even though by law a majority of directors must be property owners, on our board most of the property owners are also the occupants of the buildings they own. Our most recent research reveals that 82 percent of downtown workers are "very satisfied" with working in the downtown community and that 91 percent of downtown residents are "very satisfied" with living there.
As for retail, the best evidence comes from the retailers themselves. In 1997, the retail-dominated Nassau Street Mall Association voted with their feet and their pocketbooks to dissolve, and join the Downtown Alliance.
The raison d'etre of a business improvement district is to enhance the environment so business can prosper and grow. The 50,000 jobs that have been created since we've started -- many in businesses new to the city -- is a good indication that we are fulfilling our mission.

Mr. Adler states that our sanitation workers are oppressed. If he had done his homework, he would have known that each member of our regular sanitation crew is a member of Teamsters Local 210, with health insurance, maternity, paternity, legal and scholarship benefits; paid vacation; paid personal days and paid sick leave. Our average salary is over 25 percent higher than you reported. While it is true that people participating in the city's Work Experience Program are assigned to our BID, over half of our regular sanitation crew are former WEP personnel.

Aid to Reader's Digest

 BODY:
In an effort to save and create jobs in the state, Empire State Development, New York's economic development agency, has given final approval for financial aid to two Westchester-based companies: Reader's Digest and AlbumX.
The $1.2 million loan to AlbumX, a Port Chester-based manufacturer of wedding albums, will go toward a $3.2 million project intended to help the company remain in the county, retain 54 jobs and create another 15 positions. 
 "It's an incentive to help them stay and grow in New York," Eric Mangan, a spokeman for Empire Development, said.
AlbumX markets its albums through photographers, camera shops and stationery stores. Besides distributing in the United States, it sells its products in Denmark, Britain and Germany.
A $250,000 grant to Reader's Digest will help the company move its technology headquarters to Chappaqua from Fairfield County, which will transfer 135 jobs to the county. Worldwide, Reader's Digest employs 4,800 people.
The move is part of a consolidation effort that began in 1998 when Thomas O. Ryder became chairman and chief executive officer of Reader's Digest after five years of declining revenues at the company.

To the Editor:
"New College Sticker Shock: Junior's Credit Card Bill" (Midstream, Feb. 27) pointed out how credit cards can be an easy trap for college students to fall into. 
 But the most important lesson for a student is not how long it takes to pay off a credit card bill for that sweater or expensive watch that he or she wants so badly. Instead, it is how much that debt will ultimately cost, after the compounding of interest rates of, say, 17 percent.
Older readers may recall when people saved their money before making a purchase. Sometimes the old ways of doing things are best.

HEADLINE: Strained Ties: I.M.F. Issue Divides U.S. and Germany

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN 

DATELINE: BERLIN, March 11

 BODY:
The fiasco over the appointment of a new managing director for the International Monetary Fund has caused serious damage to the critical German-American relationship and revealed deep personal rifts within the governing coalition of Gerhard Schroder, the Social Democratic chancellor.
With accusations flying between Berlin and Washington over one aborted German candidacy and another whose fate remains unclear, two things are evident: Germany's new political assertiveness makes the United States uncomfortable, and the German perception of America is increasingly critical. 
 Michael Steiner, the chief diplomatic adviser to Mr. Schroder, said: "It has been quite an experience trying to hit this moving target set by the Clinton administration. We have discovered that the superpower sees its global role not only in the military area but also in setting the rules of globalization through the I.M.F."
He added, "The superpower in Washington grew stronger, but Europeans are also gaining consciousness of themselves and cannot share the view that the role of the I.M.F. is simply to transport the philosophy of the superpower."
His words reflected a strained moment in a German-American relationship that has stood at the core of Germany's postwar growth into a European power. "The fight with America" was the unambiguous headline in the influential paper Die Zeit this week over a lead article that was a chronicle of discord.
Chief among the disputes, for the moment, is that surrounding the fund. The collapse of the candidacy of Caio Koch-Weser, Germany's deputy finance minister, after it was rejected by the United States has left a bitter residue marked by charges and countercharges as to who misled whom and who really made the mess. The atmosphere was not improved when the government of Social Democrats and Greens this week proposed a more conservative official, Horst Kohler, and the Clinton administration scarcely rushed to embrace him.
Mr. Kohler, the German president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, appears likely to gain at least the formal approval of European Union finance ministers on Monday. But Italy is known to have strong private reservations, and the position of the United States remains unclear.
The affair has proved particularly poisonous because Mr. Schroder -- habitually a follower of the all-politics-is-local school with little taste or instinct for international affairs -- chose to make a personal crusade of the German quest to head the fund in Washington.
"This was the chancellor's step into the foreign policy arena," said a member of the cabinet. "And now he is angry with the United States, angry with Joschka Fischer and angry with himself."
The chancellor's irritation with Mr. Fischer, the Green foreign minister, has some of its roots in the fact that he remains much more popular than Mr. Schroder. But it has been immeasurably compounded by Mr. Fischer's evident decision, in the words of the cabinet member, "to disappear into the bushes on the I.M.F. matter."
The foreign minister, whose taste for the cameras is normally little short of irrepressible, has been conspicuously quiet, and if his much vaunted closeness to Madeleine K. Albright, the United States secretary of state, is real, it has proved of no evident usefulness to Germany in its quest to lead the fund.
There is little love lost between Mr. Fischer and Mr. Steiner, the modern-day representatives of an old German rivalry between the foreign ministry and the chancellery over the control of foreign policy. Always simmering, this friction has now been revived with a bang.
To American officials involved in the debacle, the overall impression has been one of German inexperience, mismanagement, clumsiness and ineptitude. This view, naturally, is not appreciated in Berlin.
"The German approach was to say, now we're grown-up, we're going to show you we're grown-up, and we're just going to do it, without prior consultation, without lobbying, without involving our embassies -- nothing," said one American who has played a central role in negotiations.
Certainly, Germany feels it is grown-up. Mr. Schroder's government has been at pains to make clear that it views itself as the initiator of a new phase in German history, one in which the period of postwar tutelage is over, a "Berlin Republic" has been born, and the country is ready to drop all adolescent coyness and call itself "a great European power."
As Die Zeit put it this week in trying to explain why so many tensions with the United States exist -- over the monetary fund, over American plans for a national missile-defense system, over capital punishment, over the European role in NATO and over much else: "Past are the times when one was afraid of one's own courage and rather hid differences under the carpet."
But while the United States pays lip service, and perhaps a little more, to the view that Germany's assumption of new responsibilities is healthy, it finds this more abrasive Germany unsettling. Especially when, as American officials put it, the country manages to mishandle a sensitive diplomatic quest to such an extent.
Mr. Steiner said Germany's quest to lead the International Monetary Fund had been handled as "professionally as could have been done." He added that he had documentary evidence that Germany had initially been misled by the United States.
The thrust of this "evidence" appeared in today's issue of the respected Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, which published an elaborate, unsourced account of how the United States had told Germany that it would accept any consensus candidate of the European Union, before changing its view at the last moment.
Germany had therefore played exactly by the rules in putting forward Mr. Koch-Weser and gaining formal backing for him from the European Union, only to be let down -- in Berlin's view -- by an unreliable Clinton adminstration wielding American power with all the subtlety of a sledgehammer.
"First, the Europeans just had to agree," Mr. Steiner said. "Then we had to agree on somebody with the so-called necessary strengths. Well, nobody can think about reproaching Mr. Kohler for being weak. Nobody can even think about reproaching him for not knowing his job. And Mr. Clinton himself has now said a German managing director would suit him."
The president has indeed expressed interest in a German head of the fund. But even quick American approval of Mr. Kohler -- and it is far from assured -- will not rapidly set right the battered German-American bond that remains the bedrock of America's security interests in Europe.

HEADLINE: Appalachia's Treasures Go on the Global Market

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: HONAKER, Va., March 10

 BODY:
Phyllis Street, of all people, is about to plunge into the global economy.
The coal miner's widow, who turned for survival to the quilt maker's arts that run two centuries deep in her family, will leave her home here on Big A mountain on Monday for the first airplane trip of her life. It will be to London, where she will be a star entry from the suddenly less remote back hills of Appalachia in the Ideal Home Show, Europe's premier exhibition for the booming crafts industry. 
 "It may turn out to be more than this gal can handle," said Ms. Street, a grandmotherly virtuoso of quilting, hardly shying from this creative breakthrough in which Appalachian planners have begun marketing the best of their tradition-steeped crafters by way of international trade shows and the Internet.
New networks of backwoods co-op businesses and community craft makers are taking a giant marketing leap beyond the Appalachian remoteness that long has frozen local economic opportunities.
In leaving just as spring limns the gritty hill country, Ms. Street, a painstaking maker of one-of-a-kind quilts that have come to be priced at $1,000 and more in the competitive market, is an eager pioneer. She relishes the venture for celebrating her flinty, beautiful home region as much as her careful old way with techniques like reverse applique, echo quilting, cross hatch bordering, wire-edged ribboning, tendril embroidering and "ruching" -- an Old World word surviving here to describe a particularly artful puckering of fabrics.
The London show will hardly be another weekend at the flea market. Committees of local craft masters have set firm product standards so that there can be no gimcrack stereotyping of Appalachia's best. Market connoisseurs can tell a hurried knock-off from a quilt that takes Ms. Smith a year or more to create.
The London marketing venture is to be conducted at the weeklong show from a log-cabin pavilion made by Tennessee crafts people. It is expected to produce an estimated $25 million in sales for 170 artisans and small businesses in 11 states of Appalachia, extending from central Alabama to southern New York.
"This is kind of a watershed event for us, to have some of our best people under an Appalachia umbrella at that important show," said Jesse L. White Jr., the federal co-chairman of the Appalachia Regional Commission. The commission is a state and federal venture charged with nurturing economic and social improvements in the region, which has been chronically battered by the fading of large-scale mining, textile and tobacco industries. In contrast, the commission has been emphasizing the best hope in small-business development for the burgeoning export economy.
The London expedition shows once more that Appalachia, too long prized as a campaign stop for politicians to show off their empathy, is resilient. It remains pocked with poverty but studded with master talents in traditional craft making.
Some of the London exhibitors, like Katie McLaughlin, a "sheep-to-shawl" weaver and sheep herder from Tazewell, are involved as well as teachers of residents leaving the welfare roles to find meaningful work. The new marketing for the global economy offers an enormous window to another cottage-industry exhibitor, Debbie Pierce and her five children, whom she schools at home in Jonesville, where they all produce prized wall hangings and table runners.
"This is a whole new thing for me; we'll see what's going to happen," said Ms. Smith, a quilter who works in a painterly fashion, jotting her thoughts in notebooks and snatching together delicate swatches and tattered scraps and appliques from the palettelike shelves of her workroom. She produces such deeply personal works as "Memories of Mother," a rich elegy of a quilt dedicated to the woman who taught her the homespun craft that has become the daughter's ticket to the outside world.
Here on the eve of this bit of a breakout for Appalachia, Phyllis Deel and Jeannie Stanley-Mullins, two organizers from a new Virginia marketing operation known as PACE (Purely Appalachia Craft Empowerment), roamed the hill towns. They saw to final details of the show's entries from 25 contributors chosen in the state's seven most southwestern coal counties.
The cornucopia includes Larry Counts's handmade brooms, Lee Osborne's weather vanes rendered from original drawings, the heirloom needlework of Linda Mullins's infant clothing, plus a score of other offerings, ranging from traditional slab pottery to hardwood bowls and rocking horses, and from rag rugs to apple-butter soap.
"We think the rest of the world is going to be very interested in what we have to offer," Ms. Deel proudly declared, driving switchback up Big A mountain.
What the craft masters are marketing to acquisition-hungry collectors is a tradition of quality rooted in the very back-hollow remoteness that has been both bane and blessing to Appalachia's creative people.
"My very first remembrance of quilting is being just a tiny little thing and playing in the pile of scraps my mother always had," said Ms. Street, who recently sold a quilt for $3,500 to a woman in New York.
"Mother quilted to keep us warm," she said, noting how much even the world of Appalachia is changing. "I loved that pile. I just watched her at it; that's how I learned. Use-it-up, we called that pile."

HEADLINE: Clinton Calls Republicans' Budget Plan A 'Dead End'

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11

 BODY:
President Clinton said today that the Republican-led Congress was steering the country into a "fiscal dead end" with plans for a $1.8 trillion budget that includes huge tax cuts.
In his weekly radio address, the president urged Republican leaders to "maintain the fiscal discipline" that he said had resulted in the longest economic expansion in American history. 
 Republicans said the budget agreement reached on Friday between leaders of the House and Senate budget committees deserved support because it would cut taxes while also meeting important needs.
The president, however, insisted that Republican leaders had "hardly given a second thought" to a whole list of priorities, including saving Social Security, strengthening Medicare and "continuing to put the education of our children first."
"Before they put a single penny toward educating our children, they've allocated nearly half a trillion dollars to risky tax cuts," Mr. Clinton said. "More than half our money already spent -- and not a penny on our most pressing priorities."
"They tried to take us down this road before," the president said, referring to earlier tax-cut proposals that he had opposed as fiscally irresponsible.
In the Republicans' weekly radio talk, Representative John R. Kasich of Ohio, the chairman of the House Budget Committee, said the budget agreement did not in any way risk national priorities.
"These are the goals we should strive to meet if we are sincere about building a better America," Mr. Kasich said.
The Republicans hope to push their framework for a fiscal 2001 budget through Senate and House committees later this month, and to have it completed by mid-April.
Under the framework, spending on many defense and domestic programs would total $596.5 billion next year, $10.5 billion more than this year, and increase funds for defense, education and health. Mr. Clinton wants $625 billion, leaving the two sides nearly $30 billion apart.
The plan also envisions $150 billion for tax cuts from 2001 through 2005, and leaves the door open for at least $60 billion more. The president has proposed $99 billion in tax cuts, offset almost completely by $96 billion in tax increases.
Mr. Kasich said in his radio address that the Republican plan would "first and foremost" use Social Security surpluses over the next five years -- estimated by the Congressional Budget Office at $978 billion -- to reduce the national debt.
"Not one dime of Social Security money will be spent on a bigger Washington government," he said.
Mr. Kasich also promised to continue plans to pay down the entire $3.6 trillion publicly held portion of the national debt by 2013.
"That will mean lower interest rates, more money for investment in a growing economy, and just as important, it will lift the tremendous burden of debt off the backs of our children," he said.

HEADLINE: Frank Pape, Celebrated Chicago Police Detective, Dies at 91

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN 

 BODY:
Frank Pape, a Chicago police detective who fought more than a dozen gun battles and survived without a scratch while sending nine suspects to their graves, died March 5 at his home in Park Ridge, Ill. He was 91.
In his 39 years on the force, beginning in the era of fedoras, tommy guns and gin mills, Mr. Pape won, indeed often seemed to strive for, a reputation as the toughest cop in Chicago. He fruitlessly staked out Baby Face Nelson as a new recruit, sent 300 men to prison and 5 to the electric chair and bragged that he never used his gun to fire warning shots, only to kill. 
 For two decades, Mr. Pape headed the department's robbery detail, its elite unit. There were 49 articles about him in detective magazines, and his stories provided grist for the 1950's television series "M Squad."
"I never started a fight in my life, but I'm not going to take any lip from a hoodlum," he told Coronet magazine in 1949. "I represent the city of Chicago and Chicago stopped taking orders from gangsters a long time ago."
Though he came to feel that the police were handcuffed by judicial and political supervisors, Mr. Pape's own actions were partly responsible for a famous judicial crackdown on freewheeling tactics by police officers. In 1958, without an arrest or search warrant, Mr. Pape entered the apartment of a suspect, prompting a legal case that reached the Supreme Court and resulted in his paying an $8,000 fine.
The effect of the case, Monroe v. Pape, was to permit the federal government to bring civil rights actions against police officers in local cases. Charles Adamson, who wrote "The Toughest Cop in America," a biography of Mr. Pape to be published this summer by Dilettante Press, likened the restraining effect on police to the Miranda decision, which protects suspects by requiring that officers warn them of their rights against self-incrimination when they are arrested.
When Time reported on that case, Mr. Pape filed a $350,000 libel suit against the magazine. This case, too, went all the way to the Supreme Court, which ruled against Mr. Pape. Time had based its article on a previously published report by the United States Commission on Civil Rights and did not make it clear that the report recounted accusations of racism and abuse on Mr. Pape's part, rather than established facts.
However, the Court eventually ruled that the misreading of an ambiguous document did not amount to the "actual malice" necessary to prove libel of Mr. Pape, a public official. In legal terms, when a public official is involved, actual malice involves knowledge that the published information was false or in reckless disregard of the truth.
Mr. Pape was born in the Bucktown section of Chicago in 1909. His father died when he was a toddler, and he became the man of the house early in life, taking care of his mother and sister. He dropped out of high school after two years to become a sheet-metal worker.
He joined the police department in 1933, two years after Al Capone had been sentenced to prison for tax evasion.He was so slight that he stuffed himself with bananas and gallons of water to make the force's 150-pound minimum weight.
But Chicago remained a place of larger-than-life cops and robbers. Those were the days when policeman would set a trap for a suspected police killer, cut him down in a hail of bullets and pose for newspaper pictures afterward. Mr. Pape established an identity by never carrying his gun in a holster: he kept it in his front pants pocket, which his wife had strengthened by sewing in a canvas lining.
He relied on shrewd intuition. Mr. Adamson tells of the sunny Sunday afternoon when Mr. Pape noticed a car approaching, with two men and a woman inside. "There's something dirty about that car," he said, as he whipped his own car around to stop the vehicle.
The three emerged blasting, but Mr. Pape and his partner won the gun battle. It turned out that one of the men had killed a police officer. On at least two other occasions, Mr. Pape used the same maneuver, Mr. Adamson said.
John Haberkorn, a retired police commander, insisted that Mr. Pape chose his targets carefully. "He never went after the good guys," Mr. Haberkorn said. "He went after the bums and hoodlums."
In a 1994 interview with The Chicago Tribune, Mr. Pape told of spotting Jackie Cerrone, a top mobster, walking down Washington Street in the early 1960's.
"He had on a gray herringbone coat with a velvet collar and a gray hat, very snappy," Mr. Pape said. "He was walking toward me, and he was with a guy who had stopped to look into a shop window. I walked up to him and said to him, 'As long as I'm commander of this district, you're not welcome here. And take that bum with you.' "
The "bum" was another mobster, Tony (Big Tuna) Accardo. "They both left like I told 'em to," Mr. Pape said.
When he heard that Mr. Cerrone was plotting to kill him when he got out of prison for murder, Mr. Pape recalled, he visited him.
"I know how to stop you murderers," he said. "What we should do is take a shotgun and blow you guys' heads off and leave you on your front lawns, ring the doorbell and let your families find you. That'll stop you."
Mr. Pape had a softer side. "The toughest guy in Chicago sings tenor," said a 1949 article in Coronet magazine. "He also dresses like a college student and frets because his children read Dick Tracy."
His son Jerry, who lives in Big Sky, Mont., said Mr. Pape found jobs for unemployed neighbors and helped buy bicycles for their children. He had a pilot's license and would take children for airplane rides. He invited his men to big parties at his cottage in Duck Lake, Ill.
In addition to his son, he is survived by his wife, Kitty, and his daughter, Judy Clark, of Park Ridge.
Jerry Pape said his father had never fired a shot until one of his partners died in his arms. He told of being a small boy and having his father came home late at night and wake him.
"I just killed a guy, and I want you to know one thing about me," Mr. Pape told his son. "Everybody I shot and killed deserved it. I slept like a baby after every one."

HEADLINE: Republicans See an Opportunity to Fault Candidate Gore as Gasoline Prices Rise

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 11

 BODY:
Republicans in Congress have begun to blame the Clinton administration generally and Vice President Al Gore in particular for the recent jump in the price of gasoline, and that seems sure to become a hot issue in the presidential race.
When prices started to rise, "the administration was asleep at the wheel," Representative Dick Armey of Texas, the House majority leader, said this week. 
 The Senate Republican leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, referred to the 4.3-cents-a-gallon increase in the federal gasoline tax enacted in 1993 as "the Gore gas tax" and told reporters it should be repealed.
Senator Frank H. Murkowski of Alaska said flatly what was on the minds of many of his fellow Republicans: "This is going to be a big issue in the political campaign."
The matter was hardly raised in the presidential primaries, largely because there was little difference in the positions of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas and Senator John McCain of Arizona on the one hand and those of Mr. Gore and former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey on the other. But the Bush and Gore camps have little doubt now that they will be arguing about this until the election in November.
Mindy Tucker, a Bush campaign spokeswoman, said the governor was "seriously reviewing" the question of whether to advocate cutting the federal gasoline tax.
A Gore campaign spokesman, Douglas Hattaway, said that if Mr. Bush embraced this plan being pushed by some Republicans in Congress to lower fuel taxes, it "would add to the perception that he is reckless and doesn't know what he is doing."
The average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline, which was about $1.25 at Christmas, is now more than $1.35. This week, the Energy Department warned that the price would rise to an average of $1.80 and as high as $2 a gallon in some places by the time people go on summer vacations.
That is not just costly to motorists. Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has warned that high energy prices could damage the economy.
Polls show that the public tends to have more confidence in Democrats on some of the most prominent issues in this year's election campaigns, including education, health care and gun control. Republicans clearly hope that high fuel prices will work in their favor.
The main reason for the increase was a decision in March 1999 by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and one major producer that does not belong to the cartel, Mexico, to force up the price of crude oil by limiting production. The price of a barrel of crude oil is now about $32, up from $12 a year ago. There are 42 gallons in a barrel.
The principal response from the Clinton administration has been to try to persuade the oil-producing nations to reverse course. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson has been traveling the globe to twist arms, and he told the House Commerce Subcommittee on Energy and Power this week that he expected a decision to raise production when OPEC meets on March 27.
Republicans in Congress deride this policy. "What's this administration done?" asked Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, the assistant Republican leader. "Nothing except to increase energy taxes."
As for Mr. Richardson, Senator Nickles said, "All he's done is run around the world saying, 'We need more imports; send us more imports.' "
But despite their contempt for the administration's policy, there is no consensus among Republicans on a solution. That prompted Representative John D. Dingell of Michigan, one of the leading Democratic authorities in the House on energy matters, to say in an interview, "It sounds to me as if they're playing politics with the problem and doing it in a way that doesn't make any sense."
These are some of the proposals being considered in Congress:
*Releasing oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve; alternatively, some lawmakers want to allow oil companies to borrow from the reserve and sell the oil at the current high price with a promise to return even more oil to the reserve after prices fall.
*Suspending the federal tax on diesel fuel or repealing the 4.3-cent additional gasoline tax, or both.
*Opening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska and perhaps other federal land in the American West to oil exploration.
*Repealing the moratorium on offshore drilling.
*Imposing sanctions against countries that restrict oil production.
*Requiring that one-fifth of the United States energy supply in 2020 come from renewable sources like wind and solar power.
Some or all of those proposals will be debated when Congress considers renewal of the law creating the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. The law expires at the end of this month. But each of the proposals has drawbacks and opposition.
For instance, President Clinton said last month that he was still considering whether to release crude oil from the strategic reserve, 600 million barrels in storage in Texas and Louisiana that was set aside by a 1975 law for use in a national emergency. Mr. Richardson said he had recommended against release on the ground that price fluctuation did not meet the test of emergency.
Many lawmakers from both parties favor tapping the reserve. But Governor Bush agrees with Mr. Richardson. "The strategic petroleum reserve is meant for a national wartime emergency," he said in a debate in January.
Many Republicans favor suspending or repealing the taxes on motor fuels. The federal tax is now 24.4 cents on a gallon of diesel fuel and 18.4 cents on gasoline. The last 4.3 cents of the gasoline tax was part of President Clinton's 1993 budget, which was approved by the Senate, 51 to 50, when Mr. Gore cast the tie-breaking vote.
But Representative Bill Archer of Texas, chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and one of the most ardent tax-cutters in Congress, worries that the amounts are so small they would hardly help consumers and that the action would have no effect in states like California that mandate an increase in the state gasoline tax when the federal tax drops. Worst of all, Mr. Archer says, the money from the taxes is earmarked for highway construction and other important transportation expenses, and the loss of that money could be damaging.
Mr. Bush has not taken a public stand on the tax question, but he favors the proposal of Republican lawmakers from oil-patch states to allow exploration in the wildlife refuge in northern Alaska.
Mr. Bush agrees with the Clinton administration that the best short-term solution is, as he said in the debate in New Hampshire, to insist to the oil-producing countries that "we expect you to open your spigots," but a spokesman, Ari Fleischer, contended that the administration was being ineffective in this regard.
Mr. Bush also wants to encourage the use of natural gas and research into alternative sources of energy.
Mr. Gore vigorously opposes oil exploration in the wildlife refuge as damaging to the environment, and he has promised that as president he would ban new offshore oil drilling.
The Gore campaign says the problem is not so much underproduction as overconsumption. It chides Republicans for blocking for years a tightening of fuel economy standards for motor vehicles. And vigilant as always in opposition research, the Gore issues staff is broadcasting the fact that the federal tax on gasoline and diesel fuel went up 5 cents a gallon in 1990.
That was part of the budget of Governor Bush's father.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Campaigning in the New, Not-So-Solid South

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK 

DATELINE: ATLANTA

 BODY:
ONCE it was solid, solidly Democratic. Then it began shifting, seemingly inexorably, toward becoming solidly Republican. And now? For the moment, at least, the South seems to have settled into a state of bipartisan equilibrium, where depending on the place, the year, the candidates, their resources, the economy and the issues, either party can prevail.
That new dynamic could make the South an interesting place to watch in November. Because the region remains more conservative than the rest of the country, it poses formidable challenges for the presumptive Democratic nominee, Vice President Al Gore. Indeed, recent polls show Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the apparent Republican nominee, with a healthy lead over Mr. Gore in the South, even as he trails the vice president in the rest of the country. 
 In the last two years, however, Southern Democrats have managed to stall the Republican advance, even in the most conservative states, and some believe those successes provide a glimmer of hope for Mr. Gore. If the vice president can split the South, as President Clinton did by winning four of 11 states in both 1992 and 1996, he is likely to follow his mentor to the White House. Before Mr. Clinton, the lone Democratic success in the previous three elections had been Jimmy Carter's 1980 victory in his native Georgia.
As the remnants of the presidential primary campaign move South this week, with contests on Tuesday in Texas, Florida, Tennessee, Louisiana, Mississippi and Oklahoma, the candidates will encounter a kinetic political landscape that is still searching for partisan definition. Recent elections suggest there simply is no majority party these days in the South, a region where the politics of the moment are often pitched by crosscurrents of race, religion, migration and economics.
Today's South is a place where conservative whites in southwest Georgia can embrace a black Democratic congressman, Sanford D. Bishop Jr., while their compatriots in South Carolina and Alabama rally for the Confederate battle flag.
To prevent Mr. Bush from restoring the Republican lock on the South, Mr. Gore will have to follow a formula tested in recent years by an array of Democratic candidates. It calls for focusing on mainstream concerns like education, Social Security, managed care and urban sprawl, depicting Republicans as right-wing extremists, and maximizing black turnout.
Many Republicans maintain that recent Democratic successes may be as attributable to local circumstances as to any regional realignment. But Democrats argue that more enduring forces may be at work. President Clinton, though disdained for his moral lapses, has demonstrated that Democrats can manage the economy, they say. Welfare reform has disarmed the Republicans of one of their most lethal weapons, and prosperity has quieted the clamor for tax cuts.
A smoking economy and time have softened racial tensions, raising the stakes for Republican candidates who employ racial tactics. And while they are predominantly Republican, the more than 1 million migrants who flood into the region each year tend to be less conservative than native white Southerners.
Gov. Roy E. Barnes of Georgia, who has won high ratings by championing school reform and fighting sprawl, maintains that Southern Democrats have learned how to win again. "We centrist Democrats and the African-American community have come together in a coalition that encompasses a base of middle-class whites," he said. "It's a new emerging common ground, and let me tell you, it's a force to be reckoned with."
Although troubled by Democratic victories in 1998 and 1999, Southern Republicans assert that there is plenty of room for their party to grow with help from continuing immigration, term limits, reapportionment and redistricting. The key, as in the rest of the country, may be whether Republicans can reassure the middle by distancing themselves from the unbending social conservatism promoted by the party's right wing.
"We've got to be better politicians and learn how to package our campaigns," said Representative Billy Tauzin, a Louisiana Republican. "We've got to hold to our conservative credentials and yet speak in more moderate terms."
For the last 40 years, the 11 states of the old Confederacy have undergone a striking political transformation. First gradually, and then with runaway speed, a party that barely existed has supplanted a party that dominated at every level.
IN 1960, there were no Southern Republicans in the United States Senate, none serving as governor, and only seven among the region's 106 members of Congress. As recently as 1980, only 17 percent of Southern state legislators were Republicans, and there were legislative houses in three separate Southern states -- Alabama, Arkansas and Louisiana -- without a single Republican member.
By 1998, the apex of Republican strength, the numbers presented nearly a mirror image. Eight of the South's 11 governors, 15 of its 22 United States senators and 71 of its 125 members of Congress were Republicans. In state legislatures, where the power of incumbency has made change more grudging, Republicans now hold 42 percent of all seats and control six chambers. Republicans also have made gains in the suburbs of metropolitan areas like Atlanta.
Polls show that the South did not grow appreciably more conservative during these years. But they indicate that beginning in the Reagan years, conservative Southerners have increasingly identified themselves as Republicans.
In the first half of the 20th century, solid Democratic control of the South was vital to the preservation of white supremacy. That rationale began to disintegrate when national Democratic leaders broke with the party's Southern wing and aligned with the cause of civil rights.
Many Southern whites then found a home in the Republican Party, which was already compatible with their views on economics and defense, and which lured defectors by playing the race card. Paradoxically, Southern blacks, many of them just gaining the right to vote, then flocked to the once-segregationist Democratic Party because of its national leaders' views on race.
The result was an almost exclusively white Republican Party, which is now dominated by religious conservatives, and a biracial Democratic Party where black voters play an equally influential role. That racial dynamic has generated a tried-and-true electoral equation, said Merle Black, an Emory University political scientist. "The Democrats can count on 90 percent of the black vote but typically need 40 percent of the white vote to win," he said. "The Republican Party starts with almost nothing of the black vote and thus needs 60 percent of the white vote."
For most of the last two decades, that calculus has favored the Republicans. But in the last two years the trend lines have shifted.
In 1998, Democratic candidates defeated Republican incumbent governors in Alabama and South Carolina, hung on to the Georgia governorship in a tough race and lost the seat in Florida. The Democrats also picked up one Senate seat that year, in North Carolina. They stopped the Republican advance in the House and gave up only eight legislative seats in 1,782 elections, far fewer than usual. Last year, the Democrats added the governorship of Mississippi. In addition, there has been a slowdown in Democrat-to-Republican party switching.
Those results suggested that centrist Democrats have learned to unite voters around kitchen-table issues, even if their positions upset Democratic interest groups. Republicans, by contrast, remain bewildered about how to both accommodate and control their right wing, a point driven home by this year's primaries.
"What happened to the Democrats in the 70's and 80's is now replaying itself with the Republicans," said Representative Harold E. Ford Jr., a Tennessee Democrat. "There's a discomfort on the part of many Republicans for their party to be known for prayer in schools, pro-life, racial intolerance, Bob Jones and the Confederate flag."
GOV. Mike Huckabee of Arkansas, a Republican, said that Southern voters are now less concerned with party labels than with performance in areas like education and children's health care. "The Republicans who have proven winners are ones who have tried not to sell their brand but have tried to sell their cereal," he said.
Similarly, Representative Gene Taylor, a conservative Mississippi Democrat, said that his party has been helped by the anemic record of the Republican Congress. "What I now see is people falling out of love with the Republicans," he said. "It doesn't necessarily mean they're in love with the Democrats, but the infatuation with the Republicans has passed. So it's now up to the individual candidates to prove their case. And that's the way it should be."

HEADLINE: Paralegal Jobs Surge as Law Firms Seek to Cut Costs

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
The news that first-year associates at major New York law firms may soon be paid as much as $160,000 a year can only make Anthony Griffith feel a little more secure in his job.
Mr. Griffith, 30, is a legal assistant, commonly called a paralegal, a kind of paramedic for lawyers. He cannot try a case or counsel a client. But he can do legal research, draw up court papers and double-check the accuracy of briefs filed by the partners and associates he works for. And because he can perform these and other important tasks at a fraction of the fee a lawyer commands, he is vital to his firm. Not to mention the clients and their checkbooks. 
 Mr. Griffith and his paralegal colleagues at Goodkind, Labaton, Rudoff & Sucharow, a medium-size Manhattan firm, are members of one of the fastest growing job categories in the country at a time when law firms of all sizes have been forced to become more cost competitive.
Historically, law firms used law students, junior lawyers, secretaries and clerks to do tasks now assigned to paralegals. But in the 1960's, when the civil rights and voting rights movements sought to make legal services more available to the poor, nonlawyers were trained to perform tasks that did not require a law license. Soon, private firms and government agencies began seeing the benefits of training people for this new job category.
Mark S. Arisohn of Goodkind, Labaton, one of the partners to whom Mr. Griffith is assigned, said a paralegal's time was generally billed at $90 to $125 an hour at the firms he was familiar with, while "lawyers are typically $200 and north," reaching $500 an hour in some partners' billings.
"You don't want to have a $300 an hour lawyer doing work that can be done at $100 an hour," Mr. Arisohn said. Still, others in the legal business noted, some firms that make heavy use of paralegals retain the practice of having first-year associates handle all legal research, even elementary tasks.
On a typical morning recently, Mr. Griffith was hunched over his desk at the Midtown Manhattan offices of Goodkind, Labaton preparing for a day of multiple tasks. One of the five lawyers he is assigned to had asked him to tap into the Internet to dig up articles written by an expert witness in a case. Another needed the American Arbitration Association rules for resolving employment disputes.
File cabinets and boxes nearby included more extensive assignments he had recently completed: summaries of long deposition testimony from which he had extracted the most germane parts, copies of summonses and subpoenas he had prepared and lawyers' court papers he had vetted to assure that the decisions they cited were still valid as precedents.
"I started out in high school liking the law," said Mr. Griffith, a Brooklyn resident who received a bachelor of science degree in legal assistance studies at New York City Technical College in Brooklyn. He has been working as a paralegal for seven years, the last six months at Goodkind, Labaton. The work, he said, has strengthened his interest in becoming a lawyer.
"Nothing I've seen has discouraged me," he said. "To see that what you're doing is really helping someone" has impressed him as a rewarding part of being a lawyer, he said, adding that when his personal life permits, probably in two or three years, he will apply to law school.
Mr. Griffith is among 136,000 people across the country who, government economists say, filled the paralegal ranks in 1998, the latest year for which the Bureau of Labor Statistics has figures. This is four times the number the agency estimated in 1980, and it projects that the ranks will swell to 220,000 by 2008. That is the swiftest growth rate the bureau foresees for any occupation outside the computer industry.
Paralegals are also expected to keep increasing in New York, where an estimated 13,000 work today -- two-thirds of them in New York City -- and where nearly 16,000 are projected six years from now, according to the State Department of Labor.
Explaining the occupation's surging growth since it emerged as a discrete employment category in the 1970's, Julie Sisti, who oversees the paralegal studies program at New York University, said, "We've become a more complex society, with the need to make legal services more accessible to the average person." Paralegals, with their lower-cost time, help attain this, she said.y
There appear to be no shortages of candidates to fill the openings.
"Kids coming out of college don't necessarily want to go to law school but want to work in the profession, and being a paralegal is interesting work with pretty good pay," Mr. Arisohn said. His firm has 10 paralegals to assist its 52 lawyers.
The firm's paralegal manager, Angela L. Pariselli, would not say what Goodkind, Labaton pays its legal assistants. But she said that, generally, in the city the entry-level pay in the occupation was about $25,000 a year, and was $40,000 and up for those with more than four years' experience.
Besides those who decide on paralegal work as a career, many in the job are college graduates who, like Mr. Griffith, entered the occupation because they were considering becoming lawyers and decided to put in some time as legal assistants to test their affinity for the profession.
Ms. Sisti, of New York University, similarly spoke of the many who enrolled in N.Y.U.'s paralegal course because they saw a stint as a legal assistant as "a cheaper way than law school to find out if they really like the law or have a talent for it."
Many others taking the 12-credit course, which is offered by the university's School of Continuing and Professional Studies, are looking to make paralegal work a career, she said, while still others are already employed as legal assistants but have had only on-the-job training and want to enhance their skills and advancement opportunities.
Opportunities for formal training continue to grow. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says that more than 800 programs across the country, from four-year bachelor's degree programs to certificate courses running only a few months, are offered by universities, community colleges and proprietary business schools.
No state requires paralegals to be licensed, though some have adopted voluntary standards, said Marge Dover, executive director of the National Association of Legal Assistants, based in Tulsa, Okla. She said that paralegals might perform any tasks the lawyers they work for assign to them, except that they could not give legal advice, set fees or present cases in court.
That's fine with Elizabeth Bellmar, 27, another Goodkind, Labaton paralegal, who has decided after testing the waters by working as a legal assistant that a lawyer's life is not for her.
"I don't want to write the papers, I like to fix them up," she said. "I don't want to stand up in court. It's not my nature. I like being in the background."

HEADLINE: U.S. Begins Lonely Fight To Cut Back Its U.N. Costs

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 10

 BODY:
A long, hard battle to lower American payments to the United Nations begins next week, and diplomats from a wide cross-section of nations say there is no guarantee that the issue will be resolved.
The outcome, if any, will be crucial to future relations between the organization and Washington. What hangs in the balance is $926 million in American arrears that has been held up by Congress. 
 Trying to get the money released, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright agreed last year with Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, and the ranking Democratic committee member, Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware, that the United States would seek to decrease its assessments for both the regular budget and a separate peacekeeping account.
The United States is billed for 25 percent of the regular budget and wants to lower that to 22 percent; Congress has already passed a law reducing the American portion of the total peacekeeping bill to 25 percent from 30.4 percent.
The Helms-Biden agreement created considerable resentment among member nations, including some of the United States' closest European allies and Canada, who say that no nation can make demands on the organization that violate treaty obligations to pay dues on time, in full and without conditions. Furthermore, many diplomats say that a reduction in American assessments may not necessarily unlock funds because critics of the United Nations in Congress have attached other conditions.
The Helms-Biden agreement complicates the job of Richard C. Holbrooke, the American representative, and his full-time budget negotiator, Donald Hays, as they try to convince 187 other member nations that they are not delivering an American ultimatum but arguing for a long-overdue review of assessments for all nations. The committee of member nations that decides budget allocations begins its meeting next week.
"It is the biggest mess you've ever seen," Mr. Holbrooke said in an interview this week. "But it is solvable. It's solvable if the nations band together and say: 'O.K., we're not going to take a diktat from Washington, but we are going to bring the U.N. budget process into the 21st century.' "
Under the current assessment scale, which is based on a nation's portion of the total of all member countries' gross national products, some countries -- among them Japan, Germany and South Africa -- are paying more than they should, while others like China, India, Brazil, Singapore and Kuwait pay less because of complicated discounts for low per capita income or special exemptions from peacekeeping bills. The United States share of world G.N.P. is just over 26 percent.
Mr. Holbrooke has taken his case for an across-the-board review around the world. He recently visited Portugal, which currently holds the presidency of the European Union. On Tuesday he will leave for Japan and China.
"The message I'm taking to all the capitals and, equally importantly, to dozens and dozens of meetings in New York, is that the present scale of assessments was established in 1974 and was based on economic data of that era," Mr. Holbrooke said. "There have been 57 new nations since then, and some countries have gotten richer and some have gotten poorer -- and, most important, the U.N.'s role in peacekeeping has dramatically expanded.
"At least 120 members of the U.N. will not have any change in their assessments, and those are the poorest countries. This is about the middle-income countries and the countries that are getting richer."
Japan's representative, Yukio Satoh, said in an interview that in a recent meeting in Tokyo with about 50 members of the Japanese Parliament he sensed brewing resentment over Japan's bill. Japan, with about 17 percent of the world's G.N.P., pays 20 percent of the United Nations budget. Leaving aside the United States, the four other permanent Security Council members -- Britain, China, France and Russia -- together pay 13.6 percent.
In addition, Japan has voluntarily contributed $237 million for Kosovo and $214 million for East Timor. A world away in Congo, Japan is paying the $300,000 needed to support the office of an African mediator.
"They are questioning why we have to pay this much," Mr. Satoh said of the Japanese politicians. They have been frustrated, he said, by the country's inability to secure a permanent Security Council seat, a campaign bogged down hopelessly in stalled efforts to reform the council.
Mr. Satoh said that Japan expects to take an active role in the coming budget negotiations, which he said are complicated by "188 countries with different interests and different perspectives trying to look at the same issue."

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
GORE TO EMBRACE CAMPAIGN FINANCE AS CENTRAL THEME

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE and KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 11

 BODY:
In an audacious attempt to turn one of his greatest vulnerabilities into an asset, Vice President Al Gore said today that he would make overhauling the campaign finance system a central theme of his presidential bid.
He brushed aside fresh questions about his own conduct in raising money, insisting that he had learned from his mistakes and was seizing the issue with the passion of a convert. 
 Mr. Gore made clear that he viewed his heightened zeal for campaign finance not only as a draw for the independent voters who had flocked to Senator John McCain of Arizona but as an organizing principle for his campaign against Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.
He contended that Mr. Bush had proposed an unworkable and perhaps ruinous economic plan because he was unseasoned and beholden to the special interests who have financed his campaign and expect a break on their taxes.
In his first substantive interview since effectively securing the Democratic presidential nomination on Tuesday, Mr. Gore today offered one of his bluntest condemnations of Mr. Bush.
Signaling that he was ready to dive into a months-long battle with the two-term governor, Mr. Gore said repeatedly that Mr. Bush lacked the experience to be president, stoking questions that swirled in the primaries over his rival's gravitas. He said this was evident in the governor's failure to put forth a "presidential class" economic program. Excerpts, Page 38.
"You have to wonder, does George W. Bush have the experience to be president?" Mr. Gore asked in the interview in his cabin aboard Air Force II as he flew here from Minneapolis. "I think that these two issues are closely related. The people of this country overwhelmingly reject this risky tax scheme that would put Social Security and Medicare at risk and threaten our prosperity.
"So why is he proposing it, even though the numbers don't add up? Because the vast majority of the soft-money donors have this risky tax scheme as their personal top priority. The agenda of the special-interest donors supporting Governor Bush is completely different from the agenda of the American people."
Mr. Gore's decision to embrace campaign finance as an issue seems striking, given his own history -- and the fact that when the disclosures first surfaced about his fund-raising, he steadfastly refused to concede any error.
The vice president has apparently decided that emphasizing the issue might be his best hope for attracting Mr. McCain's supporters and for inoculating himself against the Bush campaign's drive to continually try to link the vice president to campaign finance abuses.
Mr. Gore said he had taken up the issue of campaign finance in part because of the "pain" that he experienced following revelations of his role in collecting money for his and President Clinton's re-election in 1996.
As part of his new offensive today, Mr. Gore did something he rarely does -- he uttered the words "Buddhist temple," a phrase he had been careful to avoid. Now that one of his longtime fund-raisers has been convicted of excesses in connection with a fund-raising event at a Buddhist temple, and additional video has been released of him with the Buddhists, he seemed to have less trouble saying the words -- or even volunteering them.
"I made a mistake going to that Buddhist temple; I made a mistake in making telephone calls from my office," he said. "And I have learned from those mistakes.
"I have a passion for campaign finance reform," he said, "that is fueled in part because of the pain of those mistakes."
In recent days, Mr. Bush has ridiculed Mr. Gore for calling on him to reject unregulated soft money in the campaigns while at the same time the vice president has been raising such funds.
Insisting that he was not a hypocrite, Mr. Gore pointed to his appearance this morning in Minneapolis with Gov. Jesse Ventura, the independent who is a champion of campaign reform. Mr. Gore sought to validate his own position by saying of Mr. Ventura: "He's probably the best-known advocate of reform among the independents of this nation. And he makes the obvious point: That there's no inconsistency whatsoever in calling for a ban on soft money and playing by the rules as they currently exist. It's the same thing as arms control -- you can be for arms control without being for unilateral disarmament."
In the interview, Mr. Gore repeatedly invoked the name of Mr. McCain for two reasons: to use the senator's comments against Mr. Bush, a fellow Republican, and to let voters know that he considers himself the legitimate heir to McCain's loyalists.
He said he too has a genuine commitment to changing the campaign finance system because, like Mr. McCain, he has acknowledged his involvement in inappropriate fund-raising practices.
"Like John McCain, I bring the passion that comes from personal experience to the battle for campaign finance reform," he said.
The Bush campaign has been so eager to raise questions about the vice president's character that in his victory speech on Tuesday night, Mr. Bush recalled Mr. Gore's early explanation that his fund-raising practices were acceptable in the 1996 campaign because there was "no controlling legal authority."
For Mr. Gore, the matter shows no signs of going away. The New York Times reported today that senior Justice Department officials twice urged Attorney General Janet Reno to appoint an independent counsel to investigate Mr. Gore for his role in fund-raising, and at one point came closer than had been known to persuading her to appoint one.
"Al Gore can't escape the ethical cloud he's under by raining on Governor Bush," Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman, said in response to Mr. Gore's comments in the interview. "The vice president is under fire for his misrepresentations of his fund-raising actions and the F.B.I.'s conclusion that he may have given false testimony to investigators."
Asked about Mr. Gore's accusation that the governor was tied to special interests, Mr. Fleischer added, "Al Gore is the one who has rewarded his special interest contributors with overnight stays in the Lincoln Bedroom, with seats on trade missions as a quid pro quo -- and this phony charge is more evidence of how Al Gore will say anything, do anything, twist anything for political purposes."
Even as he seemed newly repentant and energized about his focus on money in politics, Mr. Gore at times was dismissive toward the subject.
For example, he brushed off questions about the new reports, in which Leon Panetta, the former White House chief of staff, recalled the vice president "listening attentively" to discussions about making calls to raise hard money. "That's old news," Mr. Gore said.
Asked whether there should be an independent investigation of his actions, if for no other reason than to reassure the public over lingering questions, Mr. Gore laughed at the idea, and said, "This was all reviewed three years ago."
He immediately turned to raising questions about Mr. Bush's campaign-finance practices. He condemned the governor for turning down federal money so that he did not have to accept spending limits.
He also criticized what he called secretly financed sneak-attack ads. On the sensitive question of how aggressively he will urge Democrats to support the administration's plan for normalizing trade relations with China, Mr. Gore asserted that he would be a vigorous advocate, even at the risk of alienating organized labor, which opposes the plan.
"I'm going to be aggressive and forward leaning in urging Congress to pass the China/W.T.O. legislation," he said of the World Trade Organization.
Asked about reverberations among unions, he replied: "Some of them have not yet endorsed me because of the fact that I'm in favor of this legislation. Others have endorsed me in spite of our disagreement on this legislation because I agree with them on 90 percent of the issues. And George Bush disagrees with them on 100 percent of the issues. I think it's the right thing." Still, on the campaign trail, Mr. Gore hardly mentions the trade agreement.
On other matters, Mr. Gore laid out issues on which he expected to engage Mr. Bush as the campaign unfolds. He said of Mr. Bush: "He has called for a set of changes that would severely damage Social Security. He has proposed an economic blueprint that in the words of John McCain would put Social Security at risk. I do not favor raising the retirement age; he has opened the door to that."
During the primary against former Senator Bill Bradley, the Gore campaign quickly lit into a suggestion that Mr. Bradley wanted to raise the retirement age, a proposal that brings swift condemnation from older Americans, whose votes Mr. Gore will be battling Mr. Bush for, especially in Florida.
Reminded that Mr. Bradley bowed out of the Democratic race imploring Mr. Gore to "run a better campaign" for the general election, Mr. Gore said in response to a question that he had no regrets about his tactics or how he had handled himself.
Rather than acknowledge Mr. Bradley's criticism that Mr. Gore had distorted his positions, Mr. Gore said only: "I have tremendous respect for Bill Bradley. At every juncture during this campaign, even when the debate got heated, I always said I always think Bill Bradley is a good man."
Turning to health care, Mr. Gore said: "I think it's shocking that under his governorship, Texas has become 50th out of 50 in health insurance for women and 49th out of 50 in health insurance for children. In light of that, how can he oppose a health care patients' bill of rights at the national level that is real? How can he fail to put forward any program whatsoever for expanding access to health insurance? He said yesterday or the day before yesterday, that it's O.K., because people can go to the emergency room. Well, it's not O.K., requiring people to fall back on the kindness of strangers by showing up at the emergency room door."
The vice president also declined to say whether Mr. Clinton had ever apologized to him for not telling him the truth about his involvement with Monica S. Lewinsky. His conversations with the president, Mr. Gore said, are private.

HEADLINE: Scaling the Barriers of Literacy and Language

BYLINE: By KAREN W. ARENSON 

 BODY:
It is the second week of school, and Kathleen Sampson has been presenting the same lesson for several days: "Amina is from Somalia. Somalia is in Africa. Da Quan is a boy. Da Quan is from China. China is in Asia." She builds sentences using facts about the students in the classroom, repeating them over and over.
This is not first grade, but ninth grade at Liberty High School in Manhattan, with immigrants 14 to 17 years old. Unlike the high-performing immigrants who remain a staple of the American education system, these teenagers arrive from all corners of the earth with one thing in common: little or no education. Long neglected, they may have come from cultures that educate boys but not girls, their schooling may have been interrupted by war or the need to work, or their education may simply have been woefully inadequate. 
 Regular programs in English as a second language often fail to help these students, many of whom cannot read or write in the languages of their homelands.
Immigrant youths with limited literacy have been coming to the United States for centuries, of course. But as they seek their places in an information-based economy with steeply rising academic standards, their plight is now viewed in a very different light. For the first time, cities are collecting data on their numbers, researching their needs and creating programs to teach them first-grade material in a high school context.
"The issue was there all along," said Pamela Dungy, a program manager in the Fresno Unified School District in California, where 22 percent of its nearly 10,000 foreign-born students had less than three years of education before enrollment. "But now we realize they are really different groups and that we have got to treat them differently."
These students can be a delicate issue, as Herman Badillo, chairman of the City University of New York, found out last fall. In talking about poorly educated students from the Dominican Republic and Mexico in New York schools, he described them as "pure Indians -- Incas and Mayans who are about, you know, five feet tall with straight hair," and he added that Mexico and Central America had never had "a tradition of education." Hispanic politicians accused him of an ethnic slur. Mr. Badillo, who was born in Puerto Rico, apologized.
Mr. Badillo's point was largely lost in the furor. Across the nation, students who are illiterate in their native languages are turning up in classrooms.
Some estimates suggest that as many as 10 to 20 percent of all immigrant students in America arrive with gaps in their schooling. A study for the United States Department of Education in 1992 estimated that 20 percent of the students with limited English in high school and 12 percent of those in middle school had missed two or more years of school before they arrived in America. New York State estimates that immigrants with little or no schooling account for 12 percent of the students with limited English in the state.
New York City has more immigrant students than any other city in the United States, and the number has risen sharply in recent decades. Only now, however, is the city working on its first count of those with limited literacy.
In a classroom on West 18th Street, one of those students, Amina Simba, a dark-eyed 16-year-old in a decorous lace-edged head scarf favored by Muslim women, strains for the teacher's attention.
"Miss, Miss," she calls, waving her hand urgently.
Her eagerness belies the brief but arduous educational journey she has taken to get there. Before arriving in New York three years ago from war-shattered Somalia and a Kenyan refugee camp, she had never been to school. In upstate New York, where she first lived, she was dropped into the eighth grade, where she learned little English and failed to master the A B C's. Now at Liberty High in Manhattan, she is finally coming to terms with English and the alphabet, addition and multiplication, continents and countries.
Amina was placed in the middle level of the literacy program when she arrived in September: her reading and writing were weak, but she could answer simple questions in English, like, "What is your name?" "Where are you from?" "Who do you live with?"
After several months, Amina was still struggling, so she was moved to the beginning literacy class with Ms. Sampson, where she is thriving. In her class, there are also students from Panama, Haiti, Yemen, China, Vietnam and Sierra Leone. Other literacy classes at the school include students from Pakistan, the Dominican Republic, Mali and the former Yugoslavia. Of the school's 500 students, about one-fifth are in its literacy programs.
Liberty was not set up to run literacy programs, but to offer a one-year transition for immigrant students. But in the early 90's, teachers at Liberty recognized that a growing number of their students could not keep up because their previous education was weak or nonexistent. Today Liberty runs three literacy programs: one in English, and bilingual programs in Spanish and Chinese.
Although the only grade offered at Liberty is the ninth, nearly two-thirds of its students are 17 or older and one-fifth are 19 or older. Not only do older students have more trouble learning new languages than younger children, but they have less time to make up what they have missed. In addition, those who are illiterate in their native language find it harder to learn another language.
Burt Posner, director of high school bilingual education for the New York City Board of Education, said schools tried to incorporate these students into their regular programs for those who need to learn English as a second language, "but it didn't work."
"They had no clue," he said. "They couldn't read Spanish or Chinese. We had to create a separate track because the kids couldn't keep up."
Mr. Posner said 15 to 20 high schools, including Liberty, now have programs for these students, but in other schools, these immigrants are still mixed with other students.
"If there are not enough students to form a class," he said, "or there isn't a teacher who knows how to teach them, you've got a real mess."
Ginger Dokie, a Liberian immigrant who views education as crucial, knows what Mr. Posner means. She said that when her daughter, Kou, who had no education in her war-torn homeland, enrolled in a local middle school in upper Manhattan, she made no progress. Mrs. Dokie demanded more, calling the school and the Board of Education. Eventually, Kou, now 15, ended up at Liberty with her two older brothers.
"They say this is the land of opportunity," Mrs. Dokie said. "But they forget to tell you that opportunity comes only with education. On the farm in Liberia, whether you have education or not doesn't matter. Here, it is not good to be a dummy, especially in New York. If you can't read, you're going nowhere. I don't want my children to be lost."
Even students who say they had 10 years of school before coming to the United States sometimes show very limited reading and writing skills in their native languages.
"If a kid has gone to school for four years in Long Island or Westchester, you'd assume there are certain things he can do," Ms. Sampson said. "But when one of our students says, 'I went to school for four years,' it doesn't mean the same thing because he may not have had the same rigor or consistency."
Mahmood Ghaleb, a gregarious 14-year-old who aspires to be an airline pilot or a police officer, said the school he attended for three years in Yemen had one grade and broken windows, and was nothing like school here. "Here I learn lot of things," he said. "In Yemen I learn nothing."
In many ways, Ms. Sampson's classroom at Liberty is like any other high school classroom, with computers on the sides, maps of the world up front and backpacks stowed under the desks.
But there are alphabet letters above the chalkboard -- uppercase and lowercase -- each with illustrations: lions, rabbits, zebras.
Ms. Sampson begins with the basics, including how to write the letters of the alphabet, what they sound like, how to make simple words, when to use capital letters. She and others reject using primers made for kindergarten or first grade, believing that these are uninteresting to their older students. Instead, the teachers often build their lessons around the students themselves.
In the third week of class, Ms. Sampson unfolded an oversize New York City subway map and talked to the students about the boroughs where they live (the Bronx, Brooklyn and Manhattan), how to pronounce them, and what trains they take to school.
Even in gym, language is emphasized. One morning, students from the literacy program sat in orderly rows on the floor and labeled a skeleton's bones: heels, shins, jaws, elbows. In later classes, they will learn about equipment and exercises.
"We realized that when our students left us, they were flunking gym in their new schools because they didn't understand the instructions," said Bruce Schnur, the principal of Liberty. "Stand up. Sit down. What a whistle means."
In three or four semesters, some students make rapid progress, mastering some spoken and written English and beginning to use standard textbooks for students their age.
When the students get to the third step in the literacy program, taught by Katie Farrell, the focus is on preparing them to move out of Liberty and survive, like fledglings being pushed out of the nest.
"The goal is to help them make the transition to regular high school, where they will have to deal with big fat American textbooks and with teachers who are not going to cut them a lot of slack for being non-native English speakers and not highly literate," Ms. Farrell said.
She feeds them coping skills to help them through the long, dense chapters of the world history textbook they are starting: how to preview a chapter, how to think about questions they might want to answer, how to figure out the meanings of unfamiliar words from the context.
The literacy program recently developed relationships with the high schools that take its students. But the new emphasis on the tough state Regents exams is making some schools less receptive; they fear that such students may not be able to pass these required tests and graduate.
It is difficult to find data on what happens to immigrant students when they start out so far behind, and Liberty has not tracked its students in any systematic way. The teachers know that some students drop out after a year or two. Others have enough of a start and enough grit to graduate. And there are the occasional tales of students who make it to -- and through -- college, like the Ethiopian boy who swam a river to escape the fighting and was captured before he made his way to New York. But they do not expect miracles.
"What we want for them is to be good enough to stand as good a chance as anyone else," Ms. Sampson said. "If we don't give them a chance, we are closing doors in their face."

HEADLINE: THE NATION: Succeeding;
From the Ruling Class, Meet the Next President

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI 

 BODY:
ONE of them was born just a dozen blocks from the White House and reared, at least when Congress was in session, in a hotel set amid the embassies of Washington. The other knew 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue as the place where his father worked for a dozen years in successive jobs: vice president of the United States for two-thirds of that time, president for the rest.
Their parallel paths of privilege took them past landmarks that were different in name but identical in spirit: St. Albans School and Harvard University for one, Phillips Academy and Yale for the other. 
 And politics pumped so strongly in their blood that one of them first ran for a seat in the House of Representatives -- the same seat his father had once occupied -- in 1976, at the age of just 28. (He won.) The other lagged only two years behind, making his own bid for Congress in 1978 at the age of 32. (He lost.)
Now, despite all the primary-season chatter about giving Americans a new kind of politics, despite the tussles in both parties over which presidential contender could bring a fresh and unjaded perspective to governing, the contest has narrowed to these two: Albert A. Gore Jr. and George W. Bush, a former senator's only son and a former president's firstborn -- namesakes and political princes with dissimilar styles but astonishingly similar inheritances.
Presidential historians and political analysts said they could not recall a previous election in American history when the nominees (presumptive, for now) of both major parties were not only such prominent political heirs but also from such similar stations and members of the same generation.
That equivalence could simply be accidental, the analysts said, but several said it speaks in part to the state of politics and the mood of the electorate. It also imbues this year's presidential race with an unusual and unusually fascinating dynamic: among the challenges facing both Vice President Gore and Mr. Bush, the Texas governor, is how they relate to their political ancestries, particularly the degree to which they reap the benefits of their backgrounds while avoiding the drawbacks. That balancing act has been a theme in both men's careers.
"I don't think either of them is going to have a slogan of 'Vote for me, keep the tradition alive,' " said Bill Carrick, a Democratic strategist, adding that such bald elevations of pedigree over merit would surely invite rejection.
But to some extent, he and other political analysts noted, the Democratic voters who backed Mr. Gore and the Republican voters who supported Mr. Bush were indeed choosing to keep certain traditions alive.
In Mr. Gore's case, the more relevant tradition may have been the last seven years of the Clinton administration. But in the cases of both candidates, voters were choosing someone with an almost congenital grasp of politics, all the social and material advantages that went along with that life style and milieu and a relative unfamiliarity with hardship or tests of character on the scale of Senator John McCain's five and a half years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam.
Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush both dealt with that war in a way that reflected their memberships in a younger, more coddled generation. Mr. Gore went to Vietnam, but only briefly, and as an Army journalist. Mr. Bush got a coveted spot as a pilot in the Texas Air National Guard and was able to stay close to home.
"If we were in a recessionary period, where class distinctions are more on the surface, there might have been more of a dialogue about that," said Don Sipple, a Republican strategist. Similarly, he said, if the nation were in the grip of a crisis, voters might reject any semblance of the status quo and seek someone who seemed just a bit more idiosyncratic and adventurous, a bit less destined.
ABRIEF period of economic fright yielded the man from Hope, Bill Clinton. A nationally devastating corruption of the public trust yielded the man from Plains, Jimmy Carter. With the world relatively peaceful and the nation phenomenally prosperous, there is no such invitation this time around for a slightly unusual upstart or self-styled maverick.
"I don't think Bradley or McCain understood that," said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster. "There's sometimes an assumption that Americans are risk-takers in good times. But Americans are really only risk-takers in bad times. There's a real interest out there in finding someone who is going to preserve what we have, someone who knows the ropes."
Ms. Lake said that in some focus groups she has conducted, voters expressed both an assumption that Mr. Bush might call his father at crucial times and a sense of comfort -- not alarm -- in that likelihood.
Mr. Gore, Mr. Bush and their supporters say it is the men's accomplishments that have made them credible presidential contenders. But their ancestries undeniably helped start and guide them on their way in politics, providing them with networks, access to money, instantly high profiles and other tactical advantages.
Additionally, their fathers' careers -- especially their failures -- taught them valuable lessons, some reflected in their current campaigns. When Albert Gore Sr.'s many distinguished years as a senator from Tennessee ended with his defeat at the polls in 1970, one reason was his Republican rival's nasty and negative approach, which Mr. Gore did not match. His son exhibited no such reticence in taking on former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey over the last nine months.
"His father's political demise was as instructive to him as anything that his father did while in office," said Bill Turque, author of a recent biography of the vice president, "Inventing Al Gore" (Houghton Mifflin). "It taught him the power of attack politics."
Mr. Bush has a similar reference point: his father's failed bid for a second term as president in 1992. President Bush ran a campaign more responsive than assertive and hampered by dissension and disloyalty in the ranks. His son sought to avoid those mistakes, quickly putting Mr. McCain on the defensive and entrusting his effort to a tightly knit circle of longtime political allies.
And yet both candidates' relationships to their patrimony are more complicated. They recognize that if they seem to be trading too heavily on their backgrounds, it could turn off voters. They also realize that their backgrounds inform and play into some of their most potent liabilities: in Mr. Gore's case, that his life and world view are utterly circumscribed by politics; in Mr. Bush's case, that his late-blooming political prominence is the result of his father's connections, not his own talents and toilings.
In the years between 1992, when Mr. Gore won the vice presidency and his father said publicly that "we raised him for it," and 1998, when his father died, Mr. Gore's advisers sometimes sought to steer reporters away from his dad.
These days, Mr. Gore almost constantly invokes Albert Gore Sr. on the campaign trail, but largely to emphasize what a self-made man his father was. He mentions that his father was poor and had to attend law school at night. The vice president need not worry that voters will think he is trying to trade on Americans' affection for his father, because only older voters in Tennessee would have the requisite memory of the man.
Former President George Bush, by contrast, is keenly remembered -- he left office only seven years ago -- and that creates both an added impetus for his son to mention him and a greater danger that some voters will raise an eyebrow when he does so. So the Texas governor is artful and sparing about it.
For much of last year, Mr. Bush's stump speech included a passage in which he acknowledged that the leap from governor to president would be a big one. "But," he added, "I've had some pretty good training."
He then went on to talk about running Texas, but the pauses he took before and after that line, and the applause it reliably elicited, left no doubt about its intent. Mr. Bush was saying, without quite saying, that being his father's son should give Americans some reassurance.
ON the eve of the New Hampshire primary, Mr. Bush and his advisers abandoned such subtlety, putting the governor's parents on a stage with him. The event was deemed by many to be a disaster, signaling to voters that a torch was being passed, rather than earned.
It was odd, because Mr. Bush usually goes out of his way to avoid that impression. His almost strenuously folksy side -- the cowboy boots he sometimes wears, the hyper-informal manner that recently prompted him to address several of the physicians at a recent campaign event as "Doc" -- seems like a self-conscious purging of the blue in his blood.
Mr. Gore takes his own stabs at a common touch. Did you know that he once lived in a trailer park? That he likes and watches "The Simpsons"? Voters at his town hall-style meetings do, because Mr. Gore has made a point of telling them.
It promises a somewhat surreal spectacle between now and November: two candidates whose life stories could not be more entwined in establishment politics, and whose current situations owe a great deal to those circumstances, competing to convince Americans that they have just the right distance from it all.

HEADLINE: Where the Money Is;
Six Central Counties Draw Jobs, People and Enormous Wealth

BYLINE: By LAURA MANSNERUS 

DATELINE: BERNARDS TOWNSHIP

 BODY:
THERE are not enough hours in the day or square feet on the ground to build all the houses that people want to buy in the Hills, a development that blankets 1,600 acres in the Watchung Hills.
Toll Brothers, one of the builders working on the last open patch of mountainside, releases lots for sale in small batches to keep demand at bay. A few weekends ago, seven lots went in three hours. With options, some houses cost $800,000 or $900,000, but the buyers want the granite and marble, sun rooms and guest suites with lavish baths. 
 "We literally cannot build fast enough," said Peter Alles, the assistant vice president overseeing the company's Hills developments. "It's where the hot spot is -- Somerset County has the gold badge for that. And the supply is drying up."
Even the 5,200 homes of the Hills cannot make a dent in the demand for housing in Somerset County, the richest and fastest-growing in New Jersey. Indeed, people here were not surprised when a national real estate survey last month declared Somerset, Middlesex and Hunterdon the hottest market in the United States.
And these three counties form the heart of what two Rutgers researchers have identified as the "wealth belt" of New Jersey. As the state booms, James W. Hughes and Joseph J. Seneca said in a report made public last fall, the money, the jobs and the population growth are drawn to the state's six central counties -- Monmouth, Middlesex, Somerset, Mercer, Hunterdon and Morris.
"We've had this tidal wave of metropolitan expansion coming out of New York and Philadelphia as a long-term dynamic," said Mr. Hughes, dean of the Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy. "Then, in the 1980's, we had the emergence of edge cities and suburban growth corridors."
The result, he said, was the shift of economic power from the northern suburbs to the more scattered office-and-freeway nodes to the south.
In this picture, the state's midsection exemplifies roaring exurban good times: a convergence of ever-richer pharmaceutical and telecommunications industries, stock market money that buys half-million-dollar houses and sport utility vehicles, a surge in consumer appetite for things large, and new Interstates to tie them all together.
In per-capita income, four of the top five counties -- Somerset, Morris, Hunterdon and Mercer -- are in the wealth belt. (The exception is Bergen, at No. 2.) Together, they are the richest slice of a state that is second in wealth only to Connecticut.
"This place is awash in money," said Barbara Lawrence, director of New Jersey Future, a statewide planning organization based in Trenton.
Ms. Lawrence says the surge in central Jersey's housing costs is largely due to the rapid growth of the pharmaceutical industry. "To me, that's what is driving prices," she said. "Government regulations are important, but the power of the capitalist system is more important."
Indeed, the system has given New Jersey an average of 73,000 new jobs a year in the last four years, and Mr. Hughes estimates that the wealth belt got nearly three-quarters of them. And everyone agrees that these are not average jobs.
"Most wealth belt residents work in a new information-age economy," Mr. Hughes said. "A good portion of the wealth belt's wealth is due to the pharmaceutical industry, all the communications employment and all those activities in the Route 1 corridor. These are extraordinarily high-quality jobs."
A second factor, he said, is the increase in dual-income households: While one spouse is usually working close to home, the other has access to the 3.8 million jobs all over the state, plus 3.4 million in New York City and 1 million in Philadelphia.
The job-fest is apparent in the environs of the Hills, built at the convergence of Interstates 287 and 278 and Route 206. Just south of Pluckemin, an old one-steeple village bisected by Route 206 and now engulfed by new housing,the corporate campuses appear: AT&T, then Pharmacia and Upjohn, then Aventis.
It seems that the highly educated, highly paid Baby Boomers that Mr. Hughes describes are just the people showing up at Toll Brothers new Patriot subdivisions, where townhouses start at $340,000 and single-family houses at about $500,000.
Mr. Alles said the average buyer is 46 years old and trading up; about 40 percent are two-income households. "A lot are professionals, upper management," he said. "The stock market is a major source of income right now."
He said about 25 percent are local residents and about 10 percent come from other parts of the country. Another 15 percent, he said, come from New York City: "You have your New York buyer, used to a two-bedroom apartment that's $800,000, coming here to get grass under his toes."
So Mr. Alles was not surprised when the National Association of Realtors, in its report for the fourth quarter of 1999, found that resale prices had risen 23.3 percent in a year. That increase was the highest in the nation; the national median price increase was 3.6 percent, and in the region comprising Essex, Union, Morris, Sussex and Warren counties, it was 9.2 percent.
If the wealth belt is drawing people who are willing to pay handsomely to go where they want to go, it is nowhere more clear than in the epicenter of desirability, Princeton.
"It's frightful," said Katherine McCool, the broker-manager of the local Gloria Nilson real estate office. Ms. McCool said that to price a house today in Princeton Township or Borough, using as a baseline a comparable property that sold in September, she would add 22 percent for the last quarter of 1999 and 10 percent for the first weeks of 2000.
Ms. McCool said increases in outlying areas were lower but still pushed up by a "phenomenal" relocation market.
"This is much different from the 80's," she said. "In the 80's we had a lot of new construction going on, so you could see the supply was coming. All buyers should be concerned about this because the inflation is not in the teens like it was then, and if you look around, there's no room to build."
Planners say the building will occur not in Princeton's ZIP codes, but in the wealth belt's rural reaches.
The Regional Planning Partnership, a nonprofit land-use planning organization, forecasts a 40 percent population increase by 2020 in its region, Mercer County and the southern portions of Middlesex and Somerset counties. According to 1999 census data released last week, the population in Somerset rose 19.4 percent.
The even more striking change, and the one that planners want to avert, is the rate at which the population is spreading out. The Regional Planning Partnership reports that while the region's population grew 21 percent from 1976 to 1996, the land area developed increased by 61 percent.
New Jersey Future, in a county-by-county calculation of how fast undeveloped land was consumed from 1986 to 1995, placed Somerset at the top. In that decade, which included a serious recession and preceded the latest boom, Somerset ate up 10 percent of its open space. Close behind were Monmouth, at 9.1 percent; Mercer, at 8.8 percent, Middlesex, at 8.6 percent, and Morris, at 7.7 percent.
Some planners say efforts to channel development to already-established centers -- the "smart growth" envisioned by the state's master development plan -- can restrain the centrifugal force. But even those working furiously to make that happen do not see how even the best planning can stop big new incursions into undeveloped areas.
One of those incursions is a 3.5 million-square-foot office complex that Merrill Lynch plans in Hopewell, near Interstate 95 north of Trenton. While the proposal caused a local furor -- and much criticism of the needed extension of sewer lines from Trenton -- the Regional Planning Council gave the proposal its qualified support.
"For 30 years we've looked at where the infrastructure is and where it should go," said Dianne R. Brake, the president of the council. "Even if you revitalized the cities and the towns in our area, there would still be a lot of growth, and where would you put it?"
Neil Upmeyer, a political consultant who serves on the board of New Jersey Future, said the Merrill Lynch proposal should have been no surprise. "From the development community's perspective, the opposition seems rather ludicrous," Mr. Upmeyer said. "You have an exit on an interstate across the road from an airport, and of course that's where you'd put an office park."
Mr. Upmeyer, like the Rutgers researchers, points to the interstates as the avenues of big development: "If you want to get to the root of the problem, it's roads."
It is fairly recent, he said, that Interstate 287 and 78 were completed and then became invitations to office parks that would draw people from the Hudson River to Pennsylvania. As an example, he cited Merck & Co., which in 1992 moved its world headquarters from Rahway to the shoulder of Interstate 78 in Readington Township.
A resident of Hunterdon County, Mr. Upmeyer is especially aware of the effects of Merck's move; with Merrill Lynch building in Hopewell, he said, "you have one place to the south and one to the north, and these put ever-increasing pressure on the middle, meaning Hunterdon County."
There, as in the other desirable and already-wealthy parts of the wealth belt, the terrain is eaten up especially fast because of large-lot zoning -- meaning big houses with lawns of two to six acres.
For that reason, among others, Mr. Upmeyer is not optimistic about Governor Whitman's well-advertised plan to preserve a million acres of open space in 10 years.
"I don't think in 10 years that this is going to happen," he said. "What are her neighbors going to think? If Tewksbury is developed, where is her legacy then?"
Ms. Brake agreed that the current zoning in most of the developing wealth belt only invites sprawl. "Single use, low density, free parking -- that's the model everywhere," she said. "Cutting up your land into two-acre lots is not going to retain your rural character."
While the loss of open space is alarming to planners and environmentalists, builders are not happy about the future either.
"Land costs generally in New Jersey, and it's true in those counties as well, have gone through the roof in the last year or two years," said Patrick O'Keefe, the director of the New Jersey Builders Association.
One reason, Mr. O'Keefe said, was the exhaustion of the supply of land that builders had bought during the big housing downturn in the last 1980's and early 90's. He also attributed some of the price increases to the new public-sector interest in acquiring land and development rights.
But while environmentalists fault state and local governments for doing too little to stop growth, Mr. O'Keefe says it has done too much.
"The state as a matter of conscious policy has strangled the approval process," he said, referring to the many applications that builders must make to public agencies before they can break ground. "There's plenty of raw land out there," he continued. "It's not an issue of acreage; it's an issue of approvals."
Mr. OKeefe said housing costs in the wealth belt were "going to get much, much worse, " noting that in Hunterdon the average price of a new price was approaching $400,000.
The consensus is that the building boom has to slow down soon. The governor's Council of Economic Advisers, which is headed by Mr. Seneca of Rutgers, forecasts a decline of 20 percent in housing starts this year. And in their report, Mr. Seneca and Mr. Hughes venture that when the Baby Boom empties its nests and retires, it will revive the market for smaller, more urban living spaces.
But for now, the researchers acknowledge, the big, new, expensive houses are selling better than ever -- especially in the big, new economy of central Jersey.
"What's been happening recently reflects the 45-to-50-year-old," Mr. Hughes said. "With their two-point-something kids, when they become teen-agers, or when people feel they can afford it, they do finally want to settle into a West Windsor, a Princeton or a Montgomery. Each kid needs a bedroom, and you need his-and-hers offices, and maybe a great room."
This, he said, is part of a national penchant for living large -- large homes, large lots and large SUV's (Mr. Hughes calls them SAVs, for suburban assault vehicles). And since the appetites can be indulged in the relatively open territory of the wealth belt, they are.
Ms. Lawrence at New Jersey Future questions whether the inflation in the size and price of housing is driven by the buyers or the builders. "We're building larger and larger houses, which of course are going to be more costly," she said. "If you ask the builders, their response would be: That's the market. But if you're selling doughnuts and 99 percent of your customers buy doughnuts, then that's your market."
To be sure, executives at Toll Brothers say: That's the market. "Our biggest homes are by far our most popular sellers," said Wayne S. Patterson, a senior vice president.
Mr. Patterson noted that Toll Brothers was building assisted-living complexes in Jackson and Monroe, and offering townhouses in many developments. But he said the majority of buyers wanted single-family homes in the 4,000-square-foot range -- and could pay for them.
Kira McCarron, the company's vice president for marketing, said central Jersey was one of the best markets in the 19 states where Toll Brothers builds.
"We've seen it go through several cycles," Ms. McCarron said, including the chancy years when AT&T started layoffs and common wisdom predicted a crash. "But given the investment made by so many already in the state, it seemed unlikely that anyone would let it tank. Where it is in the transportation corridor, how could it fail?"
At the Hills, Mr. Alles said prices had risen by an average of $75,000 since the fall of 1998. In that time, among other things, Aventis Pharmaceutical announced that it would bring 2,400 employees to its new North American headquarters in nearby Bridgewater and construction started at the Mountain View Corporate Center, which could expand to six large office buildings in Basking Ridge.
Pharmacia and Upjohn, with headquarters down the street from the Hills, plans to complete its merger with Monsanto Company in a few months, at which point employees from Monsanto's pharmaceutical operations will move in from St. Louis.
Mr. Alles said he was seeing some of the transferees. They have generous relocation packages, and they are looking for big new houses.

 CORRECTION:
The main front-page headline in the New Jersey section today refers imprecisely to the state's wealth and differs from the statistic in the article. New Jersey is not the richest state in the nation. It is second to Connecticut in personal per capita income, though higher in median household income.
An article on March 12 about population growth in central New Jersey misidentified two developments being built by Toll Brothers in Jackson and Monroe Townships. While open only to buyers 55 and older, they are not assisted living complexes.

HEADLINE: With Applications Jumping, Going Private Gets Tougher;
Strong Demand Means Independent Schools Are Becoming More Picky

BYLINE: By MARY ANNE CHUTE LYNCH 

 BODY:
LIISA WALSH, 14, of West Hartford began applying to private high schools in October, attending open houses, taking the four-hour Secondary School Admission Test, being interviewed by admissions counselors, and obtaining teacher recommendations.
The eighth grader spent January completing applications for Miss Porter's School, a boarding school for girls in Farmington, and Kingswood-Oxford School, a coeducational day school. 
 Liisa's is one of the estimated 350 applications Miss Porter's has received for the 64 freshman seats next fall.
Kingswood-Oxford received 200 applications for its 30 openings. At Choate Rosemary Hall in Wallingford, 22 applicants from around the world, including South Africa, Thailand and France, showed up for interviews on Jan. 13 after a snowstorm that was bad enough to close schools throughout the state.
The students are among the increasing number of eighth graders seeking limited seats in the state's private high schools. Admissions directors said they have been sorting through 8 to 25 percent more applications and handling up to 70 percent more inquiries than last year. Hopkins School in New Haven received 440 applications, up 10 percent from last year's 400, and Taft School in Watertown had 1,230 applicants compared to 1,142 last school year. The increasing interest has enabled college preparatory schools to be more selective in whom they admit.
And many applicants are about to find out if they have made the cut. Most schools sent out their acceptance letters on Friday.
"This year is a definite jump up" in applications, said Dana Blanchard, admissions director at Hopkins School, a coeducational day school. "It is pretty ubiquitous with just about everybody all over the country." The costs of the schools are going up, too. Margaret Goldsborough, spokeswoman for the National Association of Independent Schools, said private high schools in New England, New York and New Jersey continue to cost more than schools in the rest of the country. The median tuition for day students in private high schools in New England is $16,200, with the range being $5,850 to $21,100. Five years ago the median cost in New England was $12,208 for day students and $20,535 for boarding. The current median boarding rate is $25,900, with the range from $15,500 to $29,690.
Admissions offices said the strong economy is certainly responsibile for the increase in applications, with more and more people being able to afford the schools. The National Center for Educational Statistics in the federal Department of Education said the increased number is mostly due to the baby boomlet, or baby boom echo, because they are the children of baby boomers. These children are now moving through late elementary, junior high and early high school grades.
The federal Education Department estimates enrollment in public high schools will increase 8 percent by 2008. The number of students in Connecticut's private secondary schools rose to 9,127 from 8,500 between 1992 and 1998, and Catholic high schools have reported higher enrollments over the last eight years, said Barbara Keebler at the National Catholic Educational Association in Washington, D.C. In fact, the Association of Boarding Schools said that 1 in 6 boys and 1 in 10 girls at boarding high schools in the United States go to school in Connecticut.
"The demand for seats far exceeds supply," said Margaret Goldsborough, spokeswoman for the National Association of Independent Schools.
For eighth graders the application process can be a lot of work. Theresa and Jennifer Lamontagne, 13, twin sisters from Bloomfield, applied to four schools: Suffield Academy, Westminster School in Simsbury, Loomis Chaffee and Kingswood-Oxford. They did rough drafts of the four-page applications.
"Some of them were a little bit more involved," said Theresa Lamontagne. "It took a while.
The girls' mother, Marilyn Lamontagne, said her daughters wanted to go to boarding school, but she restricted them to Connecticut. "I have enough problem with them going an hour away," she said.
Demand may be up, but unlike public schools, which must often build additions to accommodate a growing student body, most private schools don't have any plans to make room for more students. The schools pride themselves on small classes and the individual attention students receive.
"The huge majority of schools are absolutely at max enrollment and most schools are constrained not to exceed a certain size," said Peter Tacy, director of the Connecticut Association of Independent Schools.
Greenwich Academy, for example, has been at full enrollment for the last seven years and has "no plans to expand," said Patsy Howard, the headmistress. Choate Rosemary Hall and Kingswood-Oxford have actually shrunk, cutting their admissions by 200 students in the last 10 years.
Brunswick School in Greenwich is an exception, opening a new middle school in September, a move that will make room for 20 to 40 more high school students.
The increased demand has led some schools to tighten their academic requirements and made them less tolerant of behavior lapses of enrolled students.
The current crop of freshmen at the Taft School scored in the 80-90th percentile range nationally on the Secondary School Admission Test, said Frederick Wandelt, admissions director for the coeducational boarding school. At Choate, the freshmen had a 3.8 grade-point average and similar exam scores, a leap from the 3.2 grade-point average of the late 80's, said Charlotte Murphy, a school spokeswoman.
"Ninety-eight percent of applicants can do the work and admissions committee meetings get heated," said Tom Southworth, admissions director at Loomis Chaffee School, a coeducational boarding high school in Windsor. The admissions staff must examine not only academic qualifications but also exceptional athletic, artistic or leadership skills of the applicants.
"You end up turning away a lot of qualified applicants," said Mr. Blanchard at Hopkins.
Despite the huge demand, schools continue to recruit. "For a long time, private schools were pretty quiet about our existence and didn't do much outreach," said Mr. Southworth. About 15 years ago, many schools changed how they recruited. "We've tried to make the student population as reflective as could be of the national population," he said, and to let people know "we were not just available for the sons and daughters of alumni."
Applicants to the state's private schools come from across the United States, particularly Florida, California and Texas, where wealth, large cities and a base of students had been built up in the past, said Ms. Murphy. Kingswood-Oxford has students commuting from 55 towns in Connecticut; Choate has boarders from 40 countries and 40 states; Taft even has students from Vietnam.
Financial aid is given to 28 percent of the students at Loomis Chaffee and to 41 percent of the pupils at Miss Porter's, which lists Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Laura Rockerfeller among its alumnae. "We have this huge commitment to having a balanced student body," said Rebecca Ballard, admissions director at Miss Porter's, where 18 percent of the students are minorities and 11 percent are from outside the United States.
Stephen Quish of West Hartford has three children in private schools. "I think it is a good investment in my kids," he said.
His oldest daughter, Sarah, is a sophomore at Kingswood-Oxford and her sister, Amanda, is applying for the freshman class. His son Steve is in sixth grade at Kingswood-Oxford.
"So far, for Sarah, the school has been excellent," Mr. Quish said. "She is hard-working, self-motivated and gets a lot out of the school."
Paul Rudd of Greenwich said he thought that private school would be best for his daughter, Kathryn, 13, who is an eighth grader at the Convent of the Sacred Heart, an all-girls day school in Greenwich. She said she wants to remain there for high school. "They know you better in a private school," she said.
After six years of coeducation, Kathryn said she found that "an all-girls school makes learning so much easier." "If you make a mistake, you wouldn't feel as awkward in a class with all females."
Steve Richard, 14, of Harwinton, a freshman at Taft, sought a boarding school because his public school didn't have a football team and Taft offered him financial aid, his three favorite sports and an academic challenge. One of the hardest adjustments in boarding school is "making my bed every morning," he said.
Now that most acceptance letters have been sent out, the students who have been selected will be invited to attend classes before the April deposit is due. There they will find out about such things as mandatory Saturday classes, busing cafeteria tables, dress codes and, of course, making their own beds.

HEADLINE: An Iconoclast Goes It Alone;
On the Net PSINet's Schrader Is A Force to Reckon With

BYLINE: By SETH SCHIESEL 

 BODY:
Consider it a classic Bill Schrader moment.
At a big telecommunications convention in Geneva last October, William L. Schrader, chairman of PSINet Inc., the biggest independent Internet service provider, announced that PSINet had just struck a deal to offer high-speed Internet access in Europe. The partner, he said, was Winstar Communications Inc., an American wireless carrier, allowing PSINet to bypass the Continent's traditional phone systems. 
 Trouble was, Winstar's top executives in New York knew nothing about a deal with PSINet.
"Maybe Bill was predicting the future," William L. Rouhana Jr., Winstar's chairman, said lightheartedly in an interview last week, noting that his company had never announced such an agreement.
All Mr. Schrader would say, by way of explanation, was that PSINet had indeed negotiated a European deal with Winstar. "The fact that Rouhana didn't know isn't my problem," he said.
Odd? Bizarre even? From another chairman at another company, perhaps. But for Mr. Schrader, it was simply business as usual.
In building PSINet from its modest roots in upstate New York to an international Internet powerhouse with a market value of $7.3 billion, he has never been afraid to be a bit ahead of himself -- or to risk alienating a potential partner. In fact, PSINet and Winstar are in preliminary discussions about working together, according to executives close to those talks.
Mr. Schrader, whose hobbies include target shooting, is an executive who often fires from the hip, so to speak, aiming verbal shots at allies and enemies alike and establishing a reputation as perhaps the most iconoclastic executive of his stature in the communications industry.
PSINet, with fiber optic lines around the globe, some of the world's most advanced Internet systems and a fast-growing customer base, looms as a highly attractive acquisition candidate -- one whose shares are up nearly 300 percent since October, as investors have noted its potential takeover value. It is the biggest of the Internet access providers not already snatched up by telephone companies looking to expand into cyberspace.
But PSINet has been valuable for years. And Mr. Schrader, who owns 7.45 percent of the company, has always refused to sell, sometimes leaving prospective buyers to walk away wondering if he is shrewd or headstrong -- or both.
"I think the real reason PSINet is still independent is Bill Schrader," said Richard G. Ellenberger, chief executive of Broadwing Inc., the former Cincinnati Bell. Broadwing recently filed to reduce its stake in PSINet to about 11 percent but would still be its largest shareholder. "He has built it from the ground up, and he's not through. He believes he's one of the new age of executive leaders, and he's not ready to quit."
Mr. Schrader, 48, may not be ready to quit because he has already come so far. A biologist by training, he was a co-founder in 1985 of one of the first Internet operations, called Nysernet, which initially linked academic computing centers in the cold reaches of upstate New York. In 1989, when for-profit activity was still ostensibly banned from the government-financed Internet, he founded what was then called Performance Systems International, moving it to northern Virginia to be closer to the federal agencies then overseeing the Internet.
PSINet was not only one of the first providers of Internet access service but one of the most innovative. In 1995, for instance, PSINet was a pioneer in offering unlimited Internet service at a fixed monthly fee to consumers across the nation. The pricing was set in typical Schrader fashion.
"I remember when I asked him how they chose what to charge for the flat fee," Mr. Ellenberger said. "And he said, 'Well, it was 1995 so we chose $19.95, and $19.95 sounded good to us.' And I asked him, 'You didn't do any economic modeling?' And he said, 'Nope.' "
Since then, PSINet's tactical focus has changed; the company got out of the consumer Internet business in 1996, selling its consumer unit to Mindspring Enterprises so it could focus on serving business customers and acting as a carrier's carrier for smaller Internet service providers. More recently, instead of merely providing raw Internet links, PSINet has begun to add more advanced and lucrative services by managing Web servers and computer systems that deliver corporate software applications across networks.
But the company's ultimate goal has remained constant. "I would like to build a system," Mr. Schrader said, "that can deliver all the media to all the customers on earth."
Harold S. Wills, PSINet's president and chief operating officer and a former executive at I.B.M. and Xerox, first met Mr. Schrader in the spring of 1996. "I thought he was crazy," Mr. Wills said, recalling his job interview.
"Bill said, 'We're going to kill the phone companies, and we're going to be bigger than AT&T, and it will be a lot of fun.' And I said, 'How much revenue have you got?' and he said, 'Well, last year we had $35 million.' And I said, 'Well, how are you going to do what you want to do?' And he began to explain in ways that I hadn't understood before the power of the Internet."
Many other people did not understand either. PSINet's stock traded below $10 throughout 1996, 1997 and 1998. It was not until last year, when PSINet generated more than $550 million in revenue, that investors began climbing onto the PSINet bandwagon as a way to play the growth of the Internet.
And to ride the PSINet bandwagon is to hear none of the bland modulations of boardroom-speak.
One recent day, as he drove his silver-gray Lincoln Town Car (he also owns a Porsche Boxster) from PSINet's headquarters in Herndon, Va., to one of the company's nearby network centers, Mr. Schrader was asked about one of his competitors, John W. Sidgmore. Mr. Sidgmore runs UUNet, the No. 1 Internet carrier, which is now part of MCI WorldCom and is also based in northern Virginia.
"In terms of where the market's going, we see eye to eye," Mr. Schrader said. "But John is a typical executive who will say what he thinks people want to hear and I'm not."
(In an interview later, Mr. Sidgmore said, "I'm willing to bet that on Bill's report card in sixth grade it said something like, 'Doesn't play well with others.' ")
And do not even get Mr. Schrader started on Stephen M. Case, chairman of America Online and another Virginia neighbor.
"Mr. Case is a perfect example of someone who misrepresents the truth for his own interest," Mr. Schrader said as he drove.
He cited what he saw as America Online's about-face, after it agreed to acquire Time Warner, on the need for the government to regulate the delivery of Internet data over cable television systems. Before the deal, America Online had called for a government role; after hooking up with Time Warner, the nation's second-largest operator of cable systems, many people in the industry perceived America Online as changing its stance.
"I don't like hypocrites, and Mr. Case is a hypocrite," Mr. Schrader said. He peered over the wheel, then added: "He is a self-serving businessman who's into hypocrisy and I'm not. That's why he decided to stop competing against us as an Internet service provider and get into the content business."
In a statement responding to those comments, America Online said, "Mr. Case's position on open access has been consistent from day one."
Mr. Schrader reserves his deepest ire, however, for local telephone incumbents, which he says are monopolists holding back the digital future. Bashing the Bell companies is hardly unusual among smaller communications carriers, but Mr. Schrader's company must also deal with the Bells on a daily basis, renting their local communications lines in order to reach customers.
He is particularly outspoken about Bell Atlantic, the East Coast giant with which PSINet does a significant amount of business. "I call them 'Bell Atlantis,' " Mr. Schrader said, still dishing as he drove. "Bell Atlantis is dead. They cannot exist in tomorrow. We know the customer better than they do and they can't keep up."
Why lash out at a such an important supplier?
"Because I'm honest," Mr. Schrader said. Referring to Bell Atlantic's chairman, he said, "It's not in my best interest to tell you that Ivan Seidenberg is a poor manager of a multibillion-dollar company, because they're our major supplier."
Asked for a corporate response, Susan Kraus, a Bell Atlantic spokeswoman, replied: "This is not even worth commenting on but I'll say this. Consider the source. It's hard to take anything he says seriously. This guy has a long history of making irrational statements and taking gratuitous potshots at his competitors."
Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of Mr. Schrader's blunt style is that it has not prevented him from garnering the deep respect of his peers, even those he does not treat gently. As someone who spoke up for and invested in the Internet early and often, Mr. Schrader is considered by many to be one of the handful of true Internet visionaries.
"He has enormous courage and he's as smart as a fox," said George H. Conrades, chairman of Akamai Technologies and former chairman of BBN, one of the big three early independent Internet companies, along with UUNet and PSINet. "I admire him," Mr. Conrades said.
Mr. Sidgmore of UUNet also offered a compliment of sorts. "I'm a big supporter of Bill's, as wacky as he is," Mr. Sidgmore said. "Whatever else you say, good or bad, he is steadfastly committed to his vision for the company."
In fact, Mr. Sidgmore said, "I would not be surprised if you read soon that we will do some investments together."
Perhaps because of all he has built, Mr. Schrader has been reluctant to sell, despite the hundreds of millions or billions of dollars a deal could bring him, considering his personal stake in PSINet.
The last few years, Internet providers of all size and description have been snatched up by more traditional communications companies. UUNet agreed to be acquired by MFS Communications in 1996 just before MFS was acquired by WorldCom. In 1997, BBN was acquired by GTE.
That has essentially left PSINet holding out against assimilation with the communications giants. Deutsche Telekom, for instance, has explored acquiring PSInet, but those discussions were strictly preliminary. Far more likely to be suitors are the new breed of communications carrier in the United States, companies like Level 3, Qwest, Broadwing and Nextlink.
"I've tried to buy PSINet at least 10 times over the last few years," Mr. Sidgmore said. "Right after MFS bought us we tried to buy him. I tried after WorldCom. I tried a bunch of times and he would never sell."
Invariably, it comes down to Mr. Schrader being Mr. Schrader. "He always had the opinion that PSInet is worth 10 times whatever his stock price is," Mr. Sidgmore said.
One reason that other Internet companies have sold out -- beyond the financial incentives -- has been their executives' notion that integrating into a bigger company can give them access to a broader set of customers.
Mr. Wills, PSINet's No. 2 executive, takes a bit more pragmatic view. "Some day, they will buy us and we will be sold, and my job is to make it more expensive for them every day that they wait," he said. "What they could have bought for $200 million, they will now probably have to pay $20 billion for."
Ask Mr. Schrader about selling his company -- well, maybe it's better not to ask. "Why should I sell the company?" he said, bristling. "Tell me."

HEADLINE: Machine Tool Orders Down 13% in Month

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
United States orders for tools that make manufacturing parts fell in January, with decreases in the Northeast, the South and the Midwest, according to an industry survey.
Machine tool orders declined 13 percent to an estimated $432 million from $494 million in December, a joint report of the Association for Manufacturing Technology and the American Machine Tool Distributors' Association said. 
 Still, January orders were 5 percent higher than a year earlier. And that gave some hope to an industry that has slumped the last two years. "On the heels of a disappointing 1999, the industry is optimistic for growth in 2000 as January orders reflect positive activity" said Ralph Nappi, president of the American Machine Tool Distributors' Association.
Orders fell 28 percent in 1999 to $5.6 billion, after falling 38.7 percent in 1998. The Standard & Poor's machine tool stock index has fallen 46 percent since January 1998.
Analysts watch the monthly order report since it gauges investment in manufacturing capacity and production. Other evidence, though, suggests that manufacturing will pick up in the months ahead.
Manufacturing increased in February at its fastest pace in four months, paced by export and production gains, a survey showed. The National Association of Purchasing Management's factory index increased to 56.9 for the month from a January reading of 56.3.

HEADLINE: A Bit Nervously, Theater Row Packs Up

BYLINE: By JULIAN E. BARNES 

 BODY:
In the late 1970's when Times Square belonged to the prostitutes and peep shows, a collection of theater companies moved into a handful of stages carved out of shuttered massage parlors on West 42nd Street.
In the years that followed the theaters suffered through stickups, recessions and aborted development projects and survived to see a renewed Midtown rise around them. 
 But now the redevelopment of 42nd Street is altering the theaters' future. The local development corporation that helped create the strip now known as Theater Row is closing four of the playhouses as it prepares to break ground on an apartment tower and collection of new stages between Dyer and Ninth Avenues. There are no definite plans for the western half of Theater Row, between Dyer and 10th Avenues, but the property owners and the theater companies that make their homes there say development is inevitable.
Although actors and stagehands are eagerly anticipating working in the new spaces that will rise on Theater Row, many said they would miss the idiosyncrasies of their current homes. Others fear that the most experimental theaters, which are also generally the poorest, will be pushed out of the neighborhood.
"I would moan about the lousy dressing rooms, but there is something that is very actor-friendly and theater-friendly about these spaces," said Anita Keal, who performs in "The Countess," a play about a 19th-century love affair. The show plans to move to Lamb's Theater on West 44th Street after its current home, the Samuel Beckett Theater, closes on Sunday.
As Ms. Keal spoke, crew members preparing the stage for the next performance offered their assessments of the theater, with its slightly-too-small stage, oddly sloping ceiling and unpredictable heat.
"It's got its quirks," said Juliet King, the assistant stage manager.
Ralph Carhart, the master electrician, added, "But the quirks are what give it its charm."
Playwrights Horizons, a nonprofit theater company, opened the first stage on the strip in 1975. Three years later the 42nd Street Development Corporation opened several more theaters in an attempt to use the performing arts to renew a desolate block. The development corporation offered inexpensive, often below-market rents to theater groups, which in return stabilized the neighborhood and brought in new, paying visitors. Theater Row became one of the early successes in the continuing effort to reinvigorate 42nd Street.
Of the eight playhouses on Theater Row, Playwrights Horizons has been the most significant, giving a start to Broadway productions like "Driving Miss Daisy," "Sunday in the Park With George" and most recently, "James Joyce's 'The Dead.' " Other theaters have also had success. "Nunsense" ran for nine years at the Douglas Fairbanks Theater.
"There was a sense of purpose; we were united on this bizarre block of Manhattan," said Andre Bishop, who worked at Playwrights Horizons from 1975 to 1991 and is now the artistic director at the Lincoln Center Theater. "Real estate gentrification was the last thing on our minds. We were just putting on plays."
But the theaters did renew the neighborhood, and now the more recent Midtown boom has opened the way for more lucrative development. The first theaters to be affected will be the four owned by the development corporation: the Theater Row, Judith Anderson, Harold Clurman and Beckett Theaters.
All four will close this month to make way for the redevelopment project. Although the contracts are not complete, the developement corporation is planning to rebuild much of the block between Ninth and Dyer Avenues and create four 99-seat stages, a 199-seat theater, a 499-seat playhouse co-owned by the Shubert Organization and an apartment tower. Some theater hands wonder aloud if the nonprofit theaters that built the row will return.
"The theaters held that area together when no one wanted to go there," said Tom Herman, who has directed shows at the Beckett and at the Pulse Ensemble Theater. "But it will be difficult for the small producers to get back into Theater Row."
Fred Papert, president of the development corporation, disputed that prediction. The proposed theaters will continue to offer discounted, affordable space to nonprofit theater productions and will not change what has made Theater Row a vibrant artistic community, he said.
"There is something that is nice and cozy about Theater Row, and that is not going to disappear," he said. "It will be just as it has always been."
But the current weekly rent for nonprofit groups, $1,800, will probably rise when the the old, worn stages are replaced with new, well-equipped performance areas, Mr. Papert acknowledged. It is also unclear how much office space will be available in the new complex for nonprofit groups to rent.
The Jewish Theater of New York has until next Monday to move its offices from Theater Row, and Tuvia Tenenbom, the artistic director, is desperately hunting for a new home. The real strength of Theater Row, Mr. Tenenbom said, was that it gave small companies access to a mainstream, suburban audience that the small downtown stages have a harder time attracting.
"On 42nd Street you get a different audience, people from New Jersey and Long Island," he said. "Here we were trying to convince the general public that pure theater isn't dead." Mr. Tenenbom said he feared that the Jewish Theater would have trouble finding the money to rent the new stages.
"It will be all commercial; it will be Merrill Lynch in the theater," he said. "It is sad. It is a little bit of the death of the theater."
Not everyone agrees. Max Ferra brought the Intar Hispanic-American Arts Center to Theater Row in 1978, leaving last year to make way for the renovation. But he said that he had been promised space in the new complex and that he believed it would attract a bigger audience and help his organization grow. "We will be part of the new 42nd Street," he said. "It will be a complete uplift of the whole street from east to west."
Ben Sprecher, the Off Broadway theater manager who will run the new 499-seat theater, said the larger theater would bring a new, bigger audience to the smaller theaters.
"We are building an ideally suited playhouse for plays and small musicals," he said. "Off Broadway is entering into what people think of as mainstream."
Although there are no specific plans for the block between Dyer and 10th Avenues, tenants there are on short-term or month-to-month leases. William J. Condren, the general partner of Theater Row Phase 2, which controls the property, said he anticipated conducting a beauty pageant among developers interested in building on the land. "Mr. Right hasn't shown up yet," he said.
But some of the theater companies on the block worry that Mr. Right will come along shortly. Alexa Kelly, the artistic director of the Pulse Ensemble Theater at 432 West 42nd Street, said she feared her company would lose its space.
"We have worked very hard to help the community, and now we are feeling very upset that we are just being ousted," Ms. Kelly said.
Eric Krebs, the owner of the John Houseman and Fairbanks Theaters, said his stages would remain open at least two more years. He said he hoped that whoever was chosen to rebuild the block between Dyer and 10th Avenues would create new spaces for Off Broadway theater.
"It is inevitable that the whole block will be changed," Mr. Krebs said. "The only hope is that the Off Broadway need will be met and the vision will be realized with a string of theaters along 42nd Street."

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Berkshire Hathaway considers buying back some of its own shares.

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris 

 BODY:
WARREN E. BUFFETT is not particularly enamored of the stocks that Berkshire Hathaway now owns, even though they have declined substantially in price. But he has found a stock he thinks is cheap -- one that Berkshire may begin buying soon: Berkshire Hathaway's own shares.
Last year was a dreadful one for Berkshire. Its major 1998 acquisition, General Re, had poor results and many of the stocks in the portfolio that brought fame and wealth to Mr. Buffett, the Berkshire chairman and chief executive, lost value even while the overall market was rising. Over all, Berkshire reported profits of $1.56 billion, or $1,025 a share, in 1999, down from $2.83 billion, or $2,262 a share a year earlier. 
 As a result, Berkshire's Class A stock fell during the year for the first time since 1990, and it has continued to fall this year, closing Friday at $41,300, less than half the $84,000 peak it reached in June 1998.
In a letter to shareholders in Berkshire's annual report, released over the weekend, Mr. Buffett again warned that stock prices are generally very high, reflecting investors' "wildly optimistic" expectations. As for the companies in which Berkshire has large positions, "the prices of the fine businesses we already own are just not that attractive," he wrote. "That's why we haven't added to our present holdings."
Berkshire has never bought back any of its own shares, and Mr. Buffett said that he thinks that share repurchases are often done by companies interested in pumping up the price of their shares even though they are already overvalued and buying back shares will, in the long run, hurt those shareholders who stay.
But Mr. Buffett said that when the share price fell below $45,000 in February, he considered making purchases, but decided against doing so until shareholders could be told of the possibility. The February plunge came on rumors regarding Mr. Buffett's health. The price soon recovered when those rumors were denied, but in recent days it has begun falling again.
By setting a price below which he deems the shares attractive, Mr. Buffett may have provided some support for the stock even if the company does not make purchases. "I view it as an I.Q. test for investors," said Alice Shroeder, an analyst for PaineWebber. "If Warren Buffett is a buyer, would you be a buyer or a seller?"
That comment reflects Mr. Buffett's legendary status as an investor. It is a reputation that has made Berkshire's annual meeting something of a pilgrimage for thousands of investors -- so much so that this year's annual meeting is being held on a Saturday, rather than on a Monday as in past years, because Mr. Buffett feared the crowds would tie up traffic in downtown Omaha if it were held on a weekday.
But Mr. Buffett's recent performance as a money manager leaves something to be desired, as he wrote in his letter to shareholders. Mr. Buffett has long measured his performance against the Standard & Poor's 500 index. It gained 19.5 percent last year, not including dividends, while Berkshire's book value, largely reflecting the value of the investments, rose just 0.5 percent.
"We had the worst absolute performance of my tenure and, compared to the S. & P., the worst relative performance as well," Mr. Buffett wrote in the company's annual report, released Saturday. "Even Inspector Clouseau could find the guilty party: your chairman."
Among the company's seven largest investments at the beginning of 1999, only one -- American Express -- rose as much as the S. & P. did during the year. Two others, The Washington Post Company and Wells Fargo, showed more modest gains, and four declined: Coca-Cola, Walt Disney, Freddie Mac and Gillette. During 1999, Mr. Buffett did not add to any of the positions. He appears to have sold all -- or at least most -- of the Disney stake and to have made smaller sales of Wells Fargo and Freddie Mac shares. So far this year, all of the six still held have gone down in price, while Disney has recovered.
Historically, Mr. Buffett has avoided technology investments. "We share the general view that society will be transformed by their products and services," he wrote in the annual report. "Our problem -- which we can't solve by studying up -- is that we have no insights into which participants in the tech field posess a truly durable competitive advantage."
Early last year, Berkshire did invest in Microsoft preferred stock that was later converted to common stock. If the company still owns that stock -- and Mr. Buffett did not discuss it in his letter -- it would be worth $19 million now. But that is a small amount relative to Berkshire's six major equity investments, whose market value at the end of last year ranged from $960 million for The Washington Post to $11.7 billion for Coca-Cola.
Over all, Berkshire Hathaway remains very much an "old economy" company. Its major business is insurance, as the owner of a number of companies including Geico, an auto insurer that has been gaining market share and in the process making life harder for other insurers with higher cost structures. In 1998, Berkshire Hathaway bought General Re, which suffered an underwriting loss of $1.2 billion last year. Mr. Buffett blamed industry conditions, but said there were signs that pricing of reinsurance policies was starting to rise.
Mr. Buffett said the company's other operations generally performed well, with the exception of its shoe business. As the owner of Dexter and H. H. Brown, Berkshire is now the largest shoe manufacturer in the country -- a dubious distinction given the decline of that industry. He said the company was trying to maintain American operations, but had shifted some production to other countries.

HEADLINE: Fiat Weighs Sale to G.M. Of a Stake In Auto Line

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER with ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 12

 BODY:
Fiat is close to selling a minority stake in its car operations to General Motors after apparently failing to sell the entire division to DaimlerChrysler, auto industry officials and executives close to the talks said today.
Fiat's board is scheduled to meet on Monday to review the proposed transaction with G.M. and is fairly likely to approve a deal, industry and other executives said today after insisting on anonymity. 
 But the meeting could last into Tuesday, and the board might ask its negotiators to continue working beyond then, especially if DaimlerChrysler comes back with a more attractive proposal at the last moment, they said.
Newspapers in Italy, where the troubles of Fiat's car division have been a long-running national story, reported today that Fiat would hand over a 20 percent stake in its car operations in exchange for a 5 percent stake in G.M. and possibly a seat on G.M.'s board. The transaction would also involve some sharing of engines and auto parts and Fiat's use of the Internet buying service for parts that G.M., DaimlerChrysler and Ford Motor are setting up, the papers reported. But auto industry officials said today that these and other provisions of the deal were still being worked out.
Foreign Trade Minister Piero Fassino of Italy said that some alliance between Fiat and a foreign carmaker was "an inevitable move." He told La Repubblica, a daily in Rome, that "whoever wishes to hold on to Fiat in its present form risks marginalizing it further and further."
G.M., DaimlerChrysler and Fiat representatives declined to comment.
If Fiat sells part or all of its car business, it is likely to focus on its profitable divisions, which make heavy trucks and tractors. Fiat is considering whether to make a bid for Volvo A. B., the world's second-largest maker of heavy trucks, executives close to the company said today. Fiat had tried unsuccessfully last year to buy all of the Swedish company, which decided instead to sell its car-building division to Ford and focus only on heavy trucks.
The European Commission is widely expected to use antitrust concerns to block Volvo's $7.4 billion acquisition of Scania, Sweden's other big truck maker. If the commission does so, Volvo would be a ripe target for a takeover, and Fiat might make an unsolicited offer, the executives said.
For its part, Volvo has made preliminary contact with several rivals including Renault's truck unit about a possible combination, the executives said, though talks are not expected to begin in earnest until the European Commission makes its final ruling.
Fiat, Italy's largest company with investments across many industries, has been struggling for nearly a year with the question of what to do with its car operations, which have been gradually losing market share in Italy and in Europe for years. Having publicly adopted the General Electric Company's management philosophy of abandoning markets in which it does not hold a commanding market share, Fiat has courted every big automaker in the world in recent months in search of an alliance or buyer for its car operations. Fiat still sells Ferraris in the United States but stopped selling new Fiat brand cars here in 1983.
Fiat's attractions are its strong market share in South America, its shrunken but still large market share in Italy and its lineup of freshly redesigned small cars, auto executives have said in interviews in recent months. While Fiat held 11 percent of the European market last year, it had nearly 38 percent of the Italian market last year and 30 percent of the promising Brazilian market.
And while the small-car market around the world is extremely unprofitable because manufacturers in South Korea and other recently industrialized countries are producing too many of them, rising oil prices are beginning to reawaken auto manufacturers' interest in the market segment.
But potential buyers have been leery of Fiat's reputation for overstaffed, inefficient factories in Italy, with powerful unions and mediocre quality.
The Italian government's recent enthusiasm for a Fiat deal with a foreign automaker has sparked hope that government money might be used to help unionized workers retire, allowing Fiat to slim down its factory work forces, said an American executive who insisted on anonymity.
G.M. has embarked on a global strategy of tying itself to midsize automakers with large stakes in their home markets or with valuable technology. In Japan, it has long had minority stakes in Isuzu and Suzuki and a technology alliance with Toyota Motor. This winter it took a stake in Fuji Heavy Industries, which makes Subaru cars and is a leader in all-wheel-drive technology, and agreed to start buying six-cylinder engines from Honda.
G.M. announced in early January that it was exercising an option to buy the half of Sweden's Saab that it did not already own. And in a single week in mid-January, the company entered into marketing partnerships with Sony, America Online and NetZero.
John F. Smith Jr., G.M.'s chairman, articulated the new strategy in a speech on Jan. 17, repudiating the company's nearly century-old strategy of self-reliance.
"Our approach is to develop long-term relationships with other companies that offer a unique advantage to the General Motors group of brands and businesses," Mr. Smith said then. "This alliance strategy is our major thrust, and it is clearly a different approach to growth than most people have associated with General Motors -- or with the rest of the industry, for that matter."
G.M. has been losing market share rapidly in the small-car segment in the United States to Korean producers and recently canceled plans to redesign the small Chevrolet Cavalier because it could not figure out how to make a profit on it. Even G.M.'s Saturn unit has been cutting back output because of slow sales.
DaimlerChrysler has also been looking for alliances and acquisitions lately, both to penetrate difficult markets and to respond to regulatory pressures.
Because its Mercedes and Chrysler divisions both make fairly large cars and sport utility vehicles, DaimlerChrysler faces difficulties in meeting the tighter fuel-economy requirements planned by the European Community, and has been looking for ways to increase its share of the small car market as a result.
Like G.M., DaimlerChrysler also needs to sell more small cars so as to lure younger, less affluent buyers to its brands.

HEADLINE: Cheap Oil's Tough Bargains

BYLINE: By Robert A. Mosbacher; Robert A. Mosbacher, chairman of the Mosbacher Energy Company and former chairman of the National Petroleum Council, was commerce secretary under President George Bush.

DATELINE: HOUSTON

 BODY:
The press has trumpeted the news that crude oil prices are three times higher than they were a year ago. But it was the $10 or $11 price of February 1999, not the one today, that really deserved the headlines.
When inflation is taken into account, that 1999 price was the lowest in modern history, while oil has gone above today's seemingly high price several times. And for the past 14 years, at $17.50, oil has been one of the real bargains of the modern age. 
 The low price has been a mixed blessing. In the United States, we have lost over 500,000 jobs in the oil industry while we have grossly increased our dependency on foreign oil; we now import 55 percent of what we use. With little incentive for drillers to find and tap new oil, supplies eventually dropped, and in the past year the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries deliberately dropped its production as well. In response to the law of supply and demand, prices have now risen.
A high oil price is not the inflationary threat it once was because with the shift toward the information and services economy, and away from manufacturing, the United States is less dependent on oil. But try to tell a consumer paying to heat his home, a trucker moving goods across the country or a commuter who goes by car that oil and gasoline are not major factors in the economy, and the answer is likely to be, "It feels like I'm being ripped off."
American consumers have been lulled into thinking cheap oil is their entitlement. Syndicated columnist Carl T. Rowan wrote recently: "We are truly a spoiled society! We insist on driving gas guzzlers and using a grossly disproportionate amount of the world's energy, and we believe we should forever be able to do so at bargain rates."
Sooner or later, oil prices are likely to drop. But prices at today's level have their advantages. With the incentive for more production back in place, there will be more drilling in new places, like the deep water off the coasts of many countries of the world, including the United States. Off our Gulf Coast, deep-water drilling, developing and producing are already going on.
Remarkable new technology now allows pipelines to bring oil from miles out to sea, where the water is as much as 8,000 feet deep. The ubiquitous deep waters of the world have great potential for additional oil and gas reserves, but drilling in 5,000 to 10,000 feet of water and then through many thousands of feet of sand, shale and other formations makes for huge costs. In many cases, this kind of oil production can only be justified by prices of at least $25 to $30 a barrel.
A higher price also encourages development of other new technologies already on the horizon, including three-dimensional seismology for mapping and horizontal drilling. And $30 oil also brings attention back to development of synthetic fuel, solar energy, wind power, gasification of coal and other methods of producing energy.
Some members of Congress have been lobbying for taking oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to help bring prices down, and President Clinton recently announced he is not ruling this out. But these reserves are set aside for use in an emergency, and tapping them is only justified if there is a genuine threat of a supply interruption, as there might be in a war or political crisis.
The reserve holds about 570 million barrels, not much when we use about 19.4 million barrels of oil products daily. Even releasing all of it could be only a temporary solution to a price problem. Tapping it would also signal the main oil-producing countries that we were trying to control world energy prices, which is inconsistent with our normal free and fair trade policies.
Even if the control of oil prices were in American hands, which it is not (since we have no means of influencing it other than using our reserves or jawboning OPEC), we would still face a daunting decision. Would we be better off getting prices back under $20 a barrel to prevent any oil-influenced inflation today, or should we take the longer view and let today's price work to bring about more drilling and new interest in other sources of energy?
Simple realities argue for the latter course: In the long term, even if bent by cartels, the law of supply and demand will rule. And in the long term, we will need the new sources of energy that higher prices can bring.

HEADLINE: PUBLIC LIVES;
The Magic Blue Blazer vs. an Oily Patch of Bad Luck

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE lucky blue blazer is at home in the closet. Energy Secretary Bill Richardson last wore the raggedy 15-year-old Brooks Brothers jacket when he was jetting across the Middle East last month, trying to convince Saudi Arabia and Kuwait that the dramatic jump in oil prices was threatening the world economy.
The blazer became his sartorial trademark early in the Clinton administration -- when he was a diplomatic troubleshooter while a member of Congress, freeing American hostages from Iraq to North Korea to Sudan -- and later as American ambassador to the United Nations. 
 Last month, he said, the jacket proved its value once more; the Saudis and the Kuwaitis said they would examine their production levels, interpreted as a commitment to reopen the spigot for oil, if only slightly.
"Does it work? Sure, it works," Mr. Richardson said as his limousine sped across town on Friday afternoon, carrying him to a television studio for yet another interview to explain the administration's plans to drive down crude oil prices that have tripled over the last year. "I wear it for all my need-to-be-lucky events."
Whatever the magical powers of his wardrobe, it is difficult to think of Mr. Richardson as lucky these days.
An hour earlier, he had been in the Oval Office with President Clinton, hashing out the next move in the mess over oil prices; a report released by the Energy Department this month said gasoline prices should hit an average of $1.75 a gallon this summer because of production cuts by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. In some states, gasoline is expected to top $2 a gallon.
"It's not my fault, but I should try to fix it," he said. "A year ago, oil inventories were high. Nobody expected this. The states didn't expect it. Consumers didn't expect it. Even traders didn't expect it. I think everybody should have been better prepared."
Mr. Richardson inherited lots of bad news when he left the United Nations to take over the Energy Department 19 months ago.
First came the reports of security lapses dating back years in the department's nuclear weapons laboratories and the accusation that Chinese spies had obtained designs for this nation's most sophisticated nuclear warheads.
Then there was the department's admission, after decades of denials, that government workers making nuclear weapons had been exposed to radiation and cancer-causing chemicals that probably led them to an early grave.
And now, the explosion in oil prices has American drivers fuming at the pump.
The run-up in gasoline prices comes at a politically awkward time for Mr. Richardson, who knows he risks becoming the government's fall guy for expensive oil just as he was reported to be under consideration as a running mate for Vice President Al Gore.
MR. RICHARDSON, 52, a collegial, slap-on-the-back politician, has long been seen as an obvious candidate for the No. 2 slot.
He is the only Hispanic in the the Cabinet, a former Democratic House leader from New Mexico with appeal to the Latino voters who are being heavily recruited by both parties in the presidential race. Born in Pasadena, Calif., he grew up in Mexico City, where his mother was born. His father, a Bostonian, worked as an executive at Citibank in Mexico for several years.
When he was a boy he was an excellent pitcher, good enough to be drafted by the Kansas City A's after high school. Instead, he went to Tufts University outside Boston, where he earned a master's degree from the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy.
Few of Mr. Richardson's rivals could have failed to notice him beaming behind Mr. Gore's confetti-caked shoulder last week as the vice president gave his victory speech after sweeping the Super Tuesday primaries.
Mr. Richardson said he had nothing to do with his conspicuous placement on the podium in Nashville. "I was behind him because that's where the Gore advance people put me. There was a piece of tape that said Richardson. I didn't elbow some little old lady to get there. Somebody put me there. I was flattered."
While Mr. Richardson campaigned for the vice president in Iowa, New Hampshire and California, often before Hispanic audiences, he insisted he has no designs on the Democratic ticket.
"We haven't talked about the vice presidency, and I'm not campaigning for it," he said. "I want to discourage speculation by answering questions like this, because it appears that I'm overeager. I just think the vice president should have a full, open search."
Certainly Mr. Richardson has begun to look more like a national candidate. After five months on the protein-heavy Atkins diet ("It works, but I'm starting to get sick of it") and a daily workout with a personal trainer, he has dropped 30 pounds, bringing his weight down to 210 pounds.
Apart from the lucky blazer, his rumpled wardrobe has been discarded; he now favors tailored suits and Hermes ties. His unruly mass of black hair has been styled back. "I've cleaned up my act," he said.
He rejected the charge of overambition, which dates to his daring -- and usually successful -- hostage-rescue missions when he was an otherwise little-known member of the House.
He made headlines around the world in 1995, when he traveled to Iraq and persuaded Saddam Hussein to free two American engineers jailed there. George Stephanopoulos, the former White House aide, used to call Mr. Richardson "a diplomatic Red Adair," alluding to the famed oil-well firefighter.
Said Mr. Richardson: "I'm as ambitious as anybody else in this town, but am I excessively ambitious? No. If I don't continue in public life, I'll be very happy."
And he admitted that he might soon find himself out of a government job. He acknowledged that his chances of winning the nod as Mr. Gore's vice presidential nominee could evaporate if gas prices continued to soar.
"I realize that gasoline prices at $2 a gallon in August or September is not good," he said. "But my main responsibility is to try to fix the problem and be a good energy secretary. If it becomes a burden, so be it."

HEADLINE: A Beneficial Trade Bill

 BODY:

To the Editor:
I support Thomas L. Friedman's call for swift Congressional action on pending legislation to increase trade with the countries of sub-Saharan Africa (column, March 7). The Africa bill is linked to another trade bill worthy of support. This bill would expand access for garments assembled in the 24 countries of the Caribbean Basin Initiative. 
 The partnership between the United States and the Caribbean Basin countries currently supports more than 400,000 jobs in the United States and more throughout the Caribbean. Our textile and apparel industry will benefit from expanding this relationship because garments assembled in Caribbean Basin countries use a high concentration of American inputs. The Caribbean countries will benefit as expanded market access promotes economic development and stability in the region. Consumers will benefit because reduced import duties will keep down apparel prices.

HEADLINE: Don't Raise Rates

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Lawrence Kudlow's March 10 Op-Ed article, "Greenspan, Through the Looking Glass," is eminently correct. Another rise in interest rates is unneccesary. The bluest of the blue-chip companies borrow money. The price of borrowing money is a cost that must be reflected in the sale of a product. It logically follows that raising interest rates is in itself inflationary. 
 The most important factor in raising our standard of living and containing inflation is productivity. Alan Greenspan has done a superb job. He is one of the best Federal Reserve chairmen this country has had. The economy is thriving. Let's leave well enough alone.

HEADLINE: They Hope to Move Up By Learning to Log On

BYLINE: By ROBYN MEREDITH 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 12

 BODY:
Small hands shot up when Daniel S. Varner asked his after-school class of mostly poor, mostly African-American children here, "Who can tell me what the Internet is?"
"It's like a big dictionary," said Jordan Nichols, 9. "A new way of communication," offered Stacey Blair, 12. And across the room, Terrell Brazier, 13, said, "It's a superhighway to anything you want." 
 To these children, and others like them who grow up poor, the Internet is all that and much more. It can be a path to the future, all right, but its effect may be more profound on those who don't know how to use it. With more and more jobs requiring computer and Internet literacy, experts fear that children not exposed to those skills will be left further behind in the new economy.
A couple of Detroit lawyers who wanted to keep that from happening have chucked their law careers to start an unusual program here that helps poor children join the information age. They draw hundreds of children into after-school sports leagues, then offer free computer training. The children learn not only how to use the computers, but also how to take them apart, fix them and put them together again. The trophy they take home is a hand-me-down computer -- there are enough for everyone on the sports teams.
"We knew kids needed the character that comes with team sports, and we knew they needed the tools of the future that come with access to technology," said Michael F. Tenbusch, who founded the nonprofit group Think Detroit with Mr. Varner in 1997. Early on, the group organized sports leagues for children.
At the same time, the group began setting up 17 computer laboratories in churches, schools and nonprofit agencies -- enough to serve 2,000 people last year -- filling them with used computers donated by area companies. But it became clear that closing the gap in computer access would require reaching homes.
So in November, Think Detroit switched strategies and began the Balls and Bytes program -- combining baseball, soccer and basketball leagues with computer classes for children over 10. The group has donated about 30 computers and plans to give away 200 more this summer.
Stacey Blair, a seventh grader at Westside Christian Academy, said that when she joined the group's baseball team she did not know she would also get a computer. She spends about an hour a day on it and went back to Mr. Varner's class to learn how to use the Internet.
Her first computer classes were intimidating. "I can't do this," Stacey remembered thinking. After the instructor took the machines apart and "showed us which spaces were for the motherboard and the cards," she said, "then I was like, this is pretty easy."
Statistics show children like Stacey are at risk of being bystanders in the digital age. Although virtually the same percentage of all children have some access to computers at school, poor and African-American children are far less likely to use a home computer, according to a poll conducted last month by National Public Radio, the Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government.
"Using the computer and the Internet can be such an important set of skills to be marketable for the economy," said Mollyann Brodie, a vice president of the Kaiser foundation. "Any digital divide will further exacerbate the gaps we've always had in our country between the haves and have-nots."
Detroit is a good example, because it is the nation's poorest big city. Many poor children here will not go to college. In the past, they might have had a Ford factory in their futures, at best. Now few workers with only a high school diploma can pass the tests automakers require.
Social workers say the gap may be even more acute for poor people who are already out of school and have had little contact with computers.
Carris M. Carey, a social worker at Focus: Hope, a nonprofit organization in Detroit that trains poor people to work in the auto industry, said, "The kids who are in the younger generation, the 18-to-25 range, have had some type of exposure to computers," even if it is not as much as the children of wealthy families have. But, Mr. Carey said, older poor people are seldom familiar with computers and the Internet.
That observation was echoed in the new national poll, Ms. Brodie said. "The gaps by income are just profound," she said. The poll found that 56 percent of those in the 18-40 age group earning less than $30,000 a year had a home computer, while 87 percent of those earning more than $50,000 a year had one.
Public schools here are struggling to keep up with their counterparts in school districts that are better off. All 263 schools in the district have now been wired for computer access, but not all schools have computers, particularly up-to-date ones, to attach to the wires, said Stan Childress, a spokesman for the Detroit Public Schools. "None of our schools have computers in every classroom, and that is a goal," he said.
For now, the secondhand computers from Think Detroit will help close the gap between technology haves and have-nots in two ways. First, more children each month are being given computers to take home. Second, they are teaching older family members how to use them.
Troy Brazier, a sixth grader at George Crockett Academy, a charter school here, took home one of the Think Detroit computers after playing baseball and basketball on one of the teams set up by the organization.
His mother works at a Target store and an older brother is a security guard, so when he got the computer home, "I had to teach them, my mom and my brother, how to use it," Troy said during a break from Mr. Varner's Internet class. "I'm still trying to learn a little more."

HEADLINE: Plans for Industrial Revival Divide Hudson River Towns

BYLINE: By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
Decades after smokestack industries largely disappeared from the Hudson River valley, leaving behind an environmental and economic mess that took years to reverse, plans are afoot to build more than a dozen industrial plants in the region.
The proposals -- including a $500 million power plant in the town of Athens, a $680 million paper recycling and power plant in Ulster, and a $300 million cement factory in Greenport -- have sharply divided towns up and down the river that have struggled, and slowly recovered, since the decline of heavy industry. 
 Those who oppose the plants say they threaten to undermine the effort to reclaim the Hudson from industrial pollution and to rebuild the region's economy through tourism.
But others welcome the return of manufacturing -- particularly the Pataki administration, which has vigorously wooed the companies with promises of state-sponsored tax-exempt bonds and local tax breaks. They say it will lure better-paying blue-collar jobs to a region where employment has improved markedly in recent years, but where wages still lag behind those of more prosperous areas.
And they are adamant that the factories will not harm the river.
"If I thought a plant would destroy the natural beauty of the Hudson River, I would act," Gov. George E. Pataki said in an interview. "But it's not got to the point where anyone has told me this is destroying the scenic beauty."
A spokesman for Mr. Pataki said that since he took office in 1995, the state had spent $256 million on cleaning and protecting the Hudson.
"We are pro-business, pro-industry," said Mr. Pataki, whose family home overlooks the river in Garrison. "We are also pro-environment. There isn't any dichotomy."
Environmentalists and many residents are unconvinced, saying that the administration has oversold the promise of factory jobs and tax revenue and underestimated the environmental cost.
"Instead of everyone saying the river's never been cleaner, we should be saying the river's never been under such threat," said Alan Neumann, president of Hudson River Heritage, a preservation group established 25 years ago. "It's been decades since we've been faced with such a concentrated series of proposals."
The proposed plants -- most of which would use the river for some part of their operation -- are early in the approval process. A spokesman for the Public Service Commission said a decision on whether to build the 1,080-megawatt Athens plant had been postponed for the third time, until April 30.
But the final approval on air quality standards has already been granted, as has the draft permit for water discharge.
Officials with the St. Lawrence Cement Company, which plans to ferry cement along two miles of conveyor belts to the riverfront, say they hope to conduct public hearings this summer. They filed their final environmental impact study on March 1.
But even if the final decisions are months, even years away, emotions are running high. Twelve New York environmental and preservation groups, led by Scenic Hudson, wrote to Governor Pataki recently urging a moratorium on industrial development until the state issues an overall plan for the development of the Hudson River.
In towns along the river, opposing sides have mounted expensive public relations campaigns. In Athens, a group collected 4,000 signatures and produced a video lambasting the proposed power plant there. In Saugerties, a citizens' group gathered 1,500 signatures against the recycling plant and claims credit for the company's decision to move to Ulster.
And preservationists aligned with Olana, Frederic Church's Moorish villa in Greenport, have joined in a lawsuit against the gas-fired electrical plant -- which they say will despoil their view.
The prospective plants even played a role in a handful of elections last fall, in which voters in Hudson and Newburgh ousted mayors who had supported factory proposals.
Things have also become a little bizarre. In Hudson, a group opposing the cement plant only a few miles away anonymously placed eight cinder blocks in prominent locations around town with one-word labels that together formed the questions: "Who will really pay? Who will really profit?"
For more than a century, the people of the Hudson Valley have tried to balance industry with maintaining the scenic landscape.
Poets, painters and philosophers trumpeted the virtues of the wilderness and the beauty of the river, and along the way the industrialists built their railroads and factories.
First came brick factories, iron mines and riverside quarries, then cement, then General Electric, all in search of cheap, unlimited river water.
By the 1960's, the Hudson River was in trouble. Industries had been dumping chemicals, and municipalities had been dumping sewage. Scientists found fish full of polychlorinated biphenyls from the General Electric plant in the Upper Hudson, cadmium from a battery factory in Cold Spring, and diesel fuel from the Metro-North yards in Croton-Harmon. The authorities banned commercial fishing and advised people not to eat striped bass caught in the river.
Meanwhile, groups committed to saving the Hudson had sprung up, and by the early 1990's, the river was being reclaimed. Billions of state and federal dollars had built state-of-the-art municipal treatment plants. Chemical dumping was curtailed.
Anticipating the deregulation of the electric industry, and eager to compete for business, New York State in 1992 created a board to expedite permits to build environmentally sound power plants. More recently, with the economy in the city booming and the demand for cement and computer chips growing, the Pataki administration began courting more industry.
The administration, aided by local towns, has extended the companies a range of tax breaks and support dollars. For instance, the Besicorp Company, which has proposed the paper recycling plant in Ulster, says it has been promised a $300 million tax-exempt bond, a $400,000 technical assistance grant and other benefits, including employment tax credits and utility discounts.
The Pataki administration has tried in particular to lure microchip-manufacturing plants, by creating four "shovel-ready" sites near the river, with licenses and environmental permits completed, so that a plant can move in quickly when a deal is struck. No companies have yet committed to the sites.
The companies have used different methods of persuasion. In Athens, for example, the town board initially opposed Athens Generating, and its promise to pay only modest taxes. But the town fathers changed their minds after the power company promised the town a $3 million "community benefits grant."
In the neighboring towns of Hudson and Greenport, the dispute over the St. Lawrence cement plant is a microcosm of the broader debate.
It has involved young and old, rich and not-so-rich. Dave Eger, one of 15 children raised to farm the rocky fields here, likes the idea of the $300 million factory set to be built about a mile from his spinach and strawberry fields. The new plant in Greenport would replace a shuttered plant across the river and would produce three times as much cement as the old one.
"The other industry has all been run out," Mr. Eger, 43, said. "People around here need jobs, and frankly, I could use the lime from the cement dust to sweeten my soil."
Next door in Hudson, the town that once thrived on the jobs provided by the defunct Atlas Cement Company, Albert Cook is far less enthusiastic. Mr. Cook, who operated a crane for Atlas for 24 years, says things have changed since his old company packed up and left in 1977. The glue factory closed down, too. So did the match factory. Even the junkyards left.
Hudson has been saved over the last decade, he said, by the people who came up from New York City and turned the down-at-the-heels town into a hive of antiques shops in restored brick buildings. He said a new factory would drive the tourists away.
"It'd be a ghost town without them," Mr. Cook said. But he knows that not everyone in Hudson agrees. "My wife feels the cement plant is a blessing," he said.
One issue the two sides have argued over is the matter of jobs, and both sides admit that unemployment has gone down in Ulster, Greene and Columbia Counties since the early 1990's.
In fact, the Hudson Valley region enjoyed the state's greatest job growth -- 5.5 percent -- in 1999.
But in Hudson, for example, wages still lag behind the state's average by almost 14 percent. And St. Lawrence's starting wage of $15.50 an hour looks good: Deena Pewtherer, the executive director of the Columbia County Chamber of Commerce, said that most area industry paid minimum wage or slightly above.
Before opening its operations in Greenport and Hudson, St. Lawrence will close the plant it still operates in Catskill. Thus, while people on the east side of the river may snag jobs, the net effect for the state will be a loss of 25 jobs, St. Lawrence officials concede.
But Mr. Eger and others like William First, 54, remain unmoved. Mr. First, who has just sold the family construction business he ran for 27 years, said the new industry would be a boon to a region suffering ever since I.B.M. laid off thousands of workers starting in the early 1990's.
"It's not just the taxes," Mr. First said, "it's the business spinoff to the restaurants, the motels, the hotels. The benefits just go on and on."
The debate is fierce, and not apt to end soon.
"It's polarizing the community in a really bad way," said Carole Clark, the chef at the Charleston Restaurant in Hudson and a member of the opposition. "It's been too easy to portray the issues in terms of the gentrifiers versus the real people."

HEADLINE: Diallo's Bronx Neighborhood Defies Stereotypes;
Multiethnic and Poor, Soundview Is Neither All Shadows Nor All Contentment

BYLINE: By AMY WALDMAN 

 BODY:
When four police officers turned down Wheeler Avenue in the Bronx one night in February 1999, they saw a dark block in a high-crime neighborhood in a borough with an international reputation for danger. In part because of where they were, they read ominous shadows in innocent movements.
To the prosecutors trying those police officers one year later for the shooting of Amadou Diallo, who lived on Wheeler Avenue, it was a place of stubborn normalcy, of mothers, strivers and neighbors. It was a tapestry of ordinariness worth celebrating. 
 One block, two visions. More than in most cases, the shooting of Amadou Diallo put a place -- Wheeler Avenue, the Soundview section and the Bronx itself -- on trial. At issue was perception: how a place appears to those who live there and to those who are just passing through; how old stereotypes of the Bronx have obscured a new and more complex reality.
Is the Bronx today a bastion of the working class, a lure to immigrants, a home to young families, as many of its residents and boosters claim and as Wheeler Avenue seems to affirm? Or is it, as the defense suggested, a place still under the sway of the old demons of drugs and crime?
Another police shooting, on March 1, shortly after the not-guilty verdict, and on Boynton Avenue just a few blocks from where Mr. Diallo lived, seemed to bolster the defense version: the block of Boynton Avenue where the shooting occurred had been the site of 144 drug-related arrests since 1997.
The truth, not surprisingly, is somewhere in between.
The Bronx today is certainly far better, brighter, safer and more stable than it was 10 or 20 years ago, but pockets of the old persist. That is why the borough president, Fernando Ferrer, can say that the Bronx today is "the same kind of place it was when I was a kid growing up -- working-class people looking for a better life," but also say, "There's been a serious drug and gun problem here for 25 years."
It is why the lead prosecutor in the Diallo trial summed up his case by painting a picture of the lives of Wheeler Avenue and saying, "None of those lives were easy, but they were solid and the neighborhood was good." And also why, District Attorney Robert T. Johnson said afterward, he did not bring the Albany jurors to the block: because he was unsure how they would react.
"For me, that is a quiet tree-lined block in the Bronx," Mr. Johnson said. "For them, it might have been seen differently."
With Mr. Diallo's bullet-pocked vestibule adorned with candles, flowers and angry signs, it is easy to forget just how normal life on Wheeler Avenue was before his death. Almost any day on the block, which is lined with red-brick row houses, men work on cars, children play basketball, an ice cream truck beseeches attention.
The citywide drop in crime was felt strongly and received thankfully on this block, where residents who once retreated inside with darkness now feel comfortable sending small children alone to the corner store at night. In 1994, there were 400 homicides in the Bronx, and 51 in the 43rd Precinct, which includes the Soundview section. In 1999, there were 137 homicides reported in the borough, and 22 in the 43rd Precinct. Almost every other major crime category except rape dropped significantly as well.
There are residents going back more than two decades on the block, but there are also many who have arrived within the last five or so years. They, like most of the block's residents, are members of the working class, with an emphasis on work: often at night, or at some distance, or for more than one employer. These are the faces, in many cases, of the service economy.
That was evident just from the scraps of information the trial witnesses provided about their own lives: Momodou Kujabi, Mr. Diallo's roommate, for example, working two jobs as a nurse's aide, from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., or Ida Vincent, a 25-year-old mother of four, opening the window a crack against her asthma and waiting for her husband to return home from his night job at a warehouse.
The median household income for Community District 9, which includes Soundview and the surrounding neighborhood, was $23,572 in 1996. The jobs, mostly, are in Manhattan, and so the elevated No. 6 train, which curves around and stops on Westchester Avenue at Elder Avenue, one block past Wheeler, is a vital economic artery. Thus did Thomas Bell, one of the trial witnesses, spy Amadou Diallo about midnight, less than an hour before the shooting, as Mr. Bell walked home down Wheeler from a long day of work as a "loss prevention officer" at Saks Fifth Avenue in Manhattan.
A Guyanese man, who gave his name only as Singh, said he makes a similar trip, working late into the night doing maintenance in Manhattan, and then catching the train home about 2 a.m. He is 62.
He arrived on the block some 15 years ago, a pioneer of immigrant life there.
Starting in the 1980's, he said, West Indians began buying homes on the block -- he bought his from an Italian woman living on Long Island -- and, if necessary, renting out rooms to cover the mortgage. More and more immigrants have arrived since, many drawn by the drop in crime.
"Fewer and fewer Spanish people," Mr. Singh said, gesturing to a few lonely Puerto Rican flags hanging out windows. In fact, there are not fewer Spanish-speaking people, according to household surveys, but their origins are diversifying. At Teleparranda, a one-stop store for long-distance calling and wiring money on Westchester Avenue, for example, the countries most frequently contacted are the Dominican Republic and Ecuador.
Wheeler Avenue and its surroundings are a microcosm of a larger trend: immigrants settling in areas that for a long period were the almost exclusive province of Puerto Ricans and African-Americans. The newcomers are West Indian, Ghanaian, Nigerian, Pakistani, Dominican, Ecuadorean, Bangladeshi, Albanian and others.
From 1990 to 1996, more than 100,000 new immigrants settled in the Bronx.
That figure does not include immigrants who did not arrive through formal channels, and it does not include those who resettled from other places. Many of the Mexicans in the Mott Haven section, for example, came from the West Coast; many of the Caribbeans in Wakefield and Williamsbridge moved from places like Brooklyn. Some Dominicans have gone straight from their homeland, but many are also moving east from Washington Heights.
Unlike, say, Brooklyn, the Bronx has relatively few ethnic enclaves; most neighborhoods now comprise a host of nationalities. And yet, across cultural divides, some blocks, this stretch of Wheeler among them, have reproduced the close-knit communities that Bronxites of old -- the Jews, Irish and others who departed for safer climes -- reminisce about.
"Everybody knows everybody" by face, if not by name, was the refrain on Wheeler in the days after the shooting, and it still is. "This block, everybody knows that is your kid, that is your grandkid," Mr. Singh said. "If a kid is missing from home, someone will grab him and take him to the right house."
But just as a block in the Bronx can hold multitudes, a neighborhood can also hold multiple personalities: one block can be solid and decent, the next, full of problems. There is no easy explanation why, although large apartment buildings full of renters seem to attract more trouble than blocks with smaller homes and homeowners.
Just one block over from Wheeler, for example, is Elder Avenue, which was mentioned frequently by the defense during the trial. For about a year, the police kept a constant watch on both ends of the block in an effort to curb drug dealing.
But today, the street is no longer cordoned off -- the police opened it up about four months ago -- and it is home to a growing Mexican colony. One of those Mexicans, Hector Soliz, a 34-year-old from Cancun via Denver, said he had moved to Elder because it seemed safer than the place he was living: Boynton Avenue, just one street over.
Boynton Avenue is where, 12 days ago, a police officer shot Malcolm Ferguson, a 23-year-old, after pursuing him in a building where there had been 86 drug arrests in the last three years.
For all the proletarian promise of Wheeler, there is Boynton Avenue, where the ladder up seems out of reach. The block where Mr. Ferguson was killed abuts the Bruckner Expressway, and is farther from the subway than Wheeler; it feels far more isolated. Its buildings are either public housing or large apartment buildings indifferently maintained.
Most of its residents are Puerto Rican, with a good number of African-Americans as well.
It is a block brightened by murals -- brightened, that is, until one takes a closer look and sees that they all commemorate death at an early age. One celebrates a young woman, Suly, killed in 1993 at age 16. Nicholas Quinones, a young man who grew up on the block, said she was accidentally shot when someone was cleaning a gun and it went off. She was pregnant, he said, so "it was two bodies."
On the opposite building is another, smaller mural, for T J. He killed himself, Mr. Quinones said. Up the block a bit is a massive mural, featuring Christ bearing a crucifix, for Victor, dead at age 17, from what cause Mr. Quinones was unsure.
Mr. Quinones's friend, Victor Alvelo, said other murals on the street had been painted over, including one at the corner that commemorated two men who died young: "One shot up," he said, "one stabbed up."
Their talk is a reminder that a drop in crime does not necessarily mean a low crime rate: even with the reduction, in 1999 the 43rd Precinct was in the top 10 citywide in murders, rapes, robberies and felony assaults.
"It is New Jack City," said Tamiko Tucker, 29, who moved to the block with her 9-year-old daughter from a shelter a year ago. With the help of a federal housing voucher, she pays $657 for a one-bedroom apartment that she said was not worth the money.
"There's drugs all over," said her friend Charlene Gidron, who has lived with her son, 7, on the block for about four years. "Dope fiend zombies, I call them."
From rodents to truants, their list of complaints was long. "I get depressed coming back here every day," said Ms. Gidron, who is 25 and pays $535 for a one-bedroom apartment. Both women gave friendly greetings to a half-dozen neighbors and their children who walked by.
But, they said, there is animosity between blacks and Hispanics, between people trying to get out and those trying to drag them down, between gangs, and between everyone and the cops.
"What are you looking at?" Ms. Gidron snapped at the officers in a passing patrol car.
Not many people on the block are working, she said. "A few."
"A few," Ms. Tucker reiterated. Both women, being squeezed off welfare, are looking for work.
Ms. Tucker disdainfully watched a woman cross the street in her slippers. "It's real low-budget over here," she said. "As soon as you move in this area, you go down."
Ms. Gidron agreed. "This is ghetto," she said of the block. "This is bad."
With their anti-cop language, gold jewelry and baggy jeans, Mr. Quinones and Mr. Alvelo seemed very much "ghetto." But they were surprisingly eager to put some distance between themselves and the street, which suggests that even on the worst block, things are not always what they seem.
Mr. Quinones said he was studying at Bronx Community College. "It beats being out here," he said.
Mr. Alvelo works as a janitor in lower Manhattan, the 4 p.m.-to-midnight shift. He is almost 21, and goes home tired. "I'm too young to be coming home and feeling old," he said of the work. "It's not something I see myself doing for the rest of my life."
With a 2-year-old daughter to support, he says he would like to sit behind a desk and make money.
"I don't see myself in the streets," he said. "That's for sure."

HEADLINE: The Tribulations of Mozambique

 BODY:
The floodwaters in Mozambique have subsided, but the need to provide for the victims is by no means diminished. The United States and other wealthy nations should be generous in providing aid. Nearly a million of Mozambique's 17 million people have lost their homes, farms or food supplies. The official death toll of 400 is expected to rise into the thousands. Tens of thousands of villagers have fled their homes for the safety of high ground. The United Nations says 250,000 Mozambicans are now living in makeshift camps, and another 250,000 remain in ruined villages around the country.
The most urgent needs are food, tents, medicine and plastic sheeting and blankets. The U.N. estimates that a third of the country's corn, the staple crop, has been destroyed. More than 40,000 head of cattle have drowned, and 141 schools have been obliterated. 
 The long-term economic consequences could be devastating for a country that is still struggling to rebuild from a 16-year civil war that ended in 1992. Mozambique remains one of the poorest countries in the world, with a per capita annual income of barely $150. But it had made impressive gains in recent years. The government of Joaquim Chissano had embraced economic reform, encouraging foreign investment, increasing exports and boosting economic growth to close to 10 percent a year, one of the highest rates in the world.
But flood damage could reduce the country's domestic product by as much as a third. After the first floods in early February, the government and the U.N. issued an urgent appeal for $65 million in foreign aid. They are expected to double or even triple that request in the coming weeks. So far, foreign donors have pledged more than $100 million. Debt relief would also help. Washington has said that it will forgive Mozambique's remaining debt. Britain, Italy, Spain and Portugal will do the same. The World Bank has accelerated its debt relief program and diverted money from long-term infrastructure to emergency road-building. These are welcome expressions of support for a country that could take years to recover from this disaster.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Gore Assails Bush on Taxes And Calls Rival Inexperienced

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: DALLAS, March 12

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore ventured into Gov. George W. Bush's backyard today and hurled spears at him, portraying his rival as so inexperienced that he would imperil Social Security for the sake of an unnecessary tax cut if elected president.
"Does Governor Bush have the experience to be president?" Mr. Gore asked a small group of retirees here at an assisted-living community. "No. A proposal like that makes you wonder, because right now we are heading in the right direction with a strong economy and continued prosperity." Mr. Gore said Governor Bush would take the nation in "the wrong direction" by trying to satisfy the wealthy special interests who were financing his campaign and wanted a tax cut. 
 Mr. Gore said that if Mr. Bush cut taxes as much as he had proposed, he would be forced to cut Medicare, dip into the Social Security trust fund or cut money for environmental and education programs. In any case, Mr. Gore warned, Mr. Bush would "take us back to the Bush-Quayle recession."
Mr. Gore is courting voters in Texas and across the South this week in advance of several primaries on Tuesday that he will undoubtedly sweep. Although these primaries are anticlimactic in the aftermath of former Senator Bill Bradley's withdrawal from the Democratic presidential race last week, Mr. Gore was trying to drive up interest in his candidacy and lay the groundwork for the fall campaign.
Even though the election is eight months away, the two putative nominees are already locked in battle, and are trying to define each other. Mr. Bush cast Mr. Gore today as galling in his presumption to adopt the mantle of campaign finance crusader, saying that Mr. Gore had in fact committed ethical lapses and "would say anything to get elected."
Meanwhile, with Gore aides saying that one of the chief concerns that voters harbor about Mr. Bush is his lack of experience, Mr. Gore is trying to stoke those doubts by portraying Mr. Bush as so unseasoned that he would ruin Social Security just to give a tax break to his wealthy contributors.
Mr. Gore said he would take all of the Social Security surplus and devote it exclusively to the Social Security program.
He said Mr. Bush had opened the door to raising the retirement age for full benefits for Social Security. Mr. Gore did not mention that the age is set to rise over the next few years to 67 anyway. Citing an account by The Associated Press, the Gore campaign noted that Mr. Bush had said in November that raising the retirement age and creating personal savings accounts might be "part of a trade-off" for securing Social Security for the baby-boom generation.
Mr. Gore said that those who were well-to-do might choose to set up private accounts, but others would be left behind. "Then you'd have a two-tier Social Security system," he said. "I say, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. Shore it up the way we always have. Social Security is the most popular program and the most successful program that has ever been enacted in the United States of America. It doesn't need to be privatized."
Having congratulated a woman in the audience who was 102 years old, Mr. Gore noted that the average lifespan of Americans was increasing, so that there were now 75,000 people over the age of 100.
"But just because lifespans are increasing," Mr. Gore said, "that doesn't mean that someone who works at hard physical labor, whether it's lifting steel or a waitress carrying a tray, has any less wear and tear on her skeleton and muscles, on the tendons and on the body, and that person is ready to retire at the age of 65 and shouldn't have to wait until the age of 70 to retire. I'm against raising the retirement age."
Mr. Gore reiterated his proposal to Mr. Bush that they both refuse to take so-called soft money, the unregulated donations to the parties, that they eliminate all campaign advertising and that they debate each other twice a week, Tuesdays and Thursdays at 8 p.m. He said this approach would prompt "a renaissance in our democracy."
He is making his arguments every chance he gets these days, both overtly and subliminally. For example, he used to deride the Reagan-Bush years that he said led the country to economic disaster. Now, he talks about the Bush-Quayle administration, which, he said in Houston on Saturday night, led to "the worst depression since the Dust Bowl days of the 1930's."
By invoking the name of Dan Quayle, who as vice president was not known for his experience or substance, and linking it with the presidency of Governor Bush's father, Mr. Gore is trying to conjure up the image of a candidate who is neither ready for the presidency nor capable of sound economic decisions.
At the same time, Mr. Gore is trying to pump up his standing with key Democratic constituencies. He arrived here this afternoon from Houston, where he rose early this morning to go jogging with Carl Lewis, the Olympic medalist. He spoke at a black church in Houston, where he delivered an extended soliloquy on the nature of racism, and visited a Mexican restaurant before flying to Dallas.
Mr. Gore is courting minority voters, here and elsewhere, because a high turnout, especially among blacks, is essential if he hopes to capture any states in the South.
Though Mr. Gore appears to have no hope of winning Governor Bush's home state of Texas, he is making a serious foray into that other Bush territory, Florida, where George Bush's brother Jeb is governor, in an effort to woo voters in that Republican-leaning state. Mr. Gore is planning to watch the primary returns on Tuesday night in Tallahassee, a sign that he intends to compete in the state in the fall.

HEADLINE: F.C.C. TO PROMOTE A TRADING SYSTEM TO SELL AIRWAVES

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 12

 BODY:
As the airwaves grow ever more congested with modern wireless communications, the federal government is developing plans to open up the spectrum by in effect treating its frequencies as commodities to be bought and sold as routinely as pork bellies or soybeans in the open market.
Officials at the Federal Communications Commission say they are preparing rules that would create a trading system in which telecommunications companies of all kinds, from old-fashioned radio stations and telephone companies to purveyors of wireless Internet services, could bid for underused slivers of the spectrum that are already under the control of other companies. 
 It would be a radical overhaul of the rules governing one of the most valuable, if intangible, forms of property in the new economy: the rights to transmit electronic signals at specific radio frequencies that constitute the spectrum. It would also have profound implications, not only for the telecommunications industries, but for consumers as well.
Under the current system, the federal government licenses each user and regulates what frequencies and signal power can be used. Most times these rights have been sold to the industry, although the oldest license holders got them free. But they have never been bought and sold in a secondary market like so many bushels of grain.
With the proliferation of cell phones, pagers, satellite services and other wireless devices, the communications agency's top officials have warned that demand is so outstripping supply that it may lead to what they call a spectrum drought, making the scarce spectrum even more valuable to haves and have-nots alike.
Now, for instance, the agency reports that the volume of traffic on the Internet is doubling every 100 days, a stunning increase considering that telephone traffic has traditionally risen about 5 percent a year. As consumers increasingly reach the Internet through wireless connections, like cell phones and handheld computers, experts fear the heavy use of the airwaves will begin to create bottlenecks and interference that could greatly frustrate the further development of the technology.
"What a tragedy it would be if, right as we're on the verge of the Internet migrating to inexpensive handheld devices and offering real hopes of truly democratizing the technology, the movement would be stymied by overloading the spectrum," William E. Kennard, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said in an interview on Friday.
Mr. Kennard, who has been pushing the agency to consider what rules need to be changed to help deregulate the spectrum to foster a new market, said the F.C.C. was just beginning to enable the licensees who own the rights to a given slice of the spectrum to make money from any surplus they have, like parts of the airwaves they may not be using 24 hours each day.
The plan began to take effect last week and will take many months to complete. In a little-noticed announcement last Thursday, the F.C.C. released rules for an auction this spring of a slice of the spectrum used by public safety organizations, including police departments and hospitals, as well as railroads.
Described by Mr. Kennard as "putting our toe in the water," the rules will reserve some of the frequencies to be auctioned to "guard band managers." They would be able to lease and trade the frequencies they win at the auction to commercial companies or private wireless users, setting up a system that opens the door to brokers who could help match buyers with sellers.
Another auction this year for even more valuable frequencies, those being vacated by broadcasters as they convert to digital television, is also being prepared in a way intended to encourage new spot markets. These frequencies, considered beachfront property by the industry, can be used for a variety of technologies beyond television, including cell phone and Internet communications.
If the idea works, the trading of spectrum futures could benefit the telecommunications companies that own licenses and other companies that cannot function without obtaining access to the airwaves. And consumers, in theory, would benefit from more capable communications devices and cheaper bills.
Just as the trade in physical commodities allows farmers to hedge against abrupt swings in price and enables consumers to count on steady supplies, economists and communications experts say a new approach that treated scarce frequencies as a commodity would allow new and older technologies to continue to flourish.
In theory, officials and economists say, the secondary market would be beneficial to consumers in several ways. Economically, it would create a more efficient and predictable way of matching supply and demand, and therefore would result in lower costs for using any equipment that makes use of the spectrum, like cell phones and pagers.
Technologically, it offers the hope of better reception for consumers who have begun to encounter greater interference as the spectrum has become overloaded.
"There is a severe spectrum shortage," said Peter Cramton, an economics professor at the University of Maryland who as chairman of the Spectrum Exchange Group, a Washington company, is involved in a private effort to auction parts of the U.H.F. television spectrum in conjunction with the broadcast auction.
"Consumers want better services," Mr. Cramton said. "They want high-speed data. They want a connection every time they place a call on their cell phones, not three-quarters of the time. The needs for users right now are great."
Officials at the Federal Communications Commission described a variety of ways a commodity market in the spectrum would work.
*News organizations covering political conventions or the Olympics would be able to buy contracts to use a piece of the spectrum during the event to give them extra capacity to beam pictures, sound and data back to their headquarters.
*A large metropolitan airport congesting the local airwaves around it with everything from air traffic transmissions to car rentals and cell phone users would be able to reserve space from other spectrum users who are not fully using their space during peak hours.
*Nationwide cell telephone companies would be able to buy and sell pieces of the spectrum in different regions of the country depending on the available supply and the demands of their customers.
Mr. Kennard and executives of some companies that are involved in creating markets for fiber-optic cable use said they envisioned a secondary market that could be set up by brokers on the Internet, much the way a secondary market exists for reserving the excess capacity of fiber-optic cable. They said the market would exist on a Web site listing what is available from licensees to trade to other companies who would want to buy or lease space, an eBay for telecommunications companies.
Companies like Arbinet Communications, Enron and the Williams Companies now act as brokers to essentially buy and then sell unused telephone time on fiber-optic cables.
At a telecommunications conference sponsored by Credit Suisse First Boston in New York last week, executives from some of the companies now involved in trading unused telephone time said that the F.C.C.'s proposal held great promise, but that it would take time to develop.
"The beauty of wireless is that the current system for trading it is so inefficient," said Eric L. Rabb, managing director of AIG Telecom, a unit of the American International Group that acts as a broker for access to time on fiber-optic cable. "What we apply now to the wired world we can apply to the wireless."
Officials at the F.C.C. say they are planning a forum this spring on ideas and rules changes for encouraging spot markets for the spectrum.
"Just through our licensing records we already have the most comprehensive list of potential sellers," Mr. Kennard said. But even as it seeks comment on changing the rules, he said, the agency is beginning to take steps beyond just the way it structures spectrum auctions to encourage the new marketplace.
This week, for instance, the agency plans to begin writing rules for a new technology that could have a profound effect on a secondary market. The technology is known as digitally defined radio, and it would allow new kinds of radios and cell phones with special software to seek out different and broader frequencies than current radios and phones.
The military has expressed interest in digitally defined radio because it would enable radios to avoid being jammed by an enemy by searching for a clean signal. But other companies are also developing products that rely on the technology.
By making broader use of the spectrum, digitally defined radio would also encourage telecommunications companies that are not using all of their licensed frequencies to their full capacity to lease their underused portions in a secondary market.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE TEXAS GOVERNOR;
Gore Talking About Reform? Hah! Says Bush

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY 

DATELINE: ALCOA, Tenn., March 12

 BODY:
Declaring that Vice President Al Gore would "say anything to get elected," Gov. George W. Bush of Texas ridiculed Mr. Gore today for stating that reform of the nation's campaign finance system would be a centerpiece of his presidential campaign.
Mr. Bush, who has repeatedly sought to turn the Clinton administration's ethical lapses into an albatross around the vice president's neck, pounced on Mr. Gore's decision to champion more restrictions on the role of money in politics, which Mr. Gore described in an interview today in The New York Times. 
 Mr. Bush said that when he saw the article, "I wasn't sure if it was an April Fool's edition or not of the newspaper."
"I couldn't believe that he is going to make campaign funding reform a cornerstone of his campaign," Mr. Bush said at a news conference in Plant City, Fla., where he was campaigning at the state's annual strawberry festival before flying to a rally in Tennessee, Mr. Gore's home state. Florida, Tennessee, Texas and several other Southern states hold primaries on Tuesday.
"After all, it was not all that long ago that he went to a Buddhist temple to raise money," Mr. Bush said. "One of his close friends was indicted and convicted of fund-raising excesses. I think the vice president is somebody who will say anything to get elected. At least that's my interpretation of how he handles things. I look forward -- the more he talks about campaign funding reform, the better off it will be for my campaign."
Karl Rove, chief strategist for the Bush campaign, referred to the fund-raising event at the Buddhist temple in California in an appearance today on the "Fox News Sunday" television program. "This is more than just a little teensy-weensy mistake," Mr. Rove said. "Sometimes Vice President Gore has a big problem telling the truth."
"The Buddhist temple involved violations of law," Mr. Rove said. "Fifty-five thousand dollars in illegal contributions were funneled through that fund-raiser, and the vice president has consistently not told the truth about his involvement in that fund-raiser."
In the interview in The Times today, Mr. Gore said he had learned from his involvement in past campaign finance problems and would vigorously try to change the system. He also said Mr. Bush, who has twice been elected governor of Texas, lacked the experience to be president.
The sparring over campaign finance reflected the extent to which the candidacy of Senator John McCain of Arizona in the Republican primary was affecting the general election. Both sides are eager to court Mr. McCain's supporters, many of whom indicated that they were attracted to Mr. McCain because of his campaign against what he deemed to be the increasingly corrupting influence of money in Washington.
Mr. Gore appeared to hope that by acknowledging his involvement in fund-raising situations that raised questions, and proclaiming that he was redoubling his efforts to change the system, he could head off Mr. Bush's effort to portray him as unprincipled.
At the news conference today, Mr. Bush emphasized his response: nothing that Mr. Gore proposes -- and no amount of mea culpas -- can erase the taint of the Clinton administration's ethics record.
While Mr. Gore referred often to Mr. McCain in his comments, seeking to cast himself as a McCain-style reformer, Mr. Bush did not mention his former rival once today. Instead, Mr. Bush promoted his own campaign finance proposal, which has been greeted coolly by advocates for tougher rules, but only when asked about it by a reporter. Bush aides said later that Mr. Bush wanted to keep the focus on the vice president's ethics.
Like Mr. McCain, Mr. Gore favors prohibiting the largely unregulated donations to political parties known as soft money. Mr. Bush supports a ban on soft-money donations from corporations and unions, but not from individuals. A soft-money ban sponsored in part by Mr. McCain has failed in Congress because of opposition from Republicans.
After discussing his campaign finance proposal, which also includes more disclosure of donations, Mr. Bush quickly returned to the theme of Mr. Gore's performance.
"Campaign funding reform starts with having people who are going to obey the laws that exist," Mr. Bush said. "That is the best campaign funding reform immediately -- is to obey laws that are on the books and have an attorney general who will fully prosecute the laws on the books."
Mr. Bush also brushed aside Mr. Gore's criticism in the Times interview that Mr. Bush was not prepared to be president. Mr. Gore cited as evidence Mr. Bush's economic plan, which Mr. Gore said was based on a "risky tax scheme" that would "threaten our prosperity." The vice president also questioned whether Mr. Bush was proposing tax breaks for wealthy contributors.
Mr. Bush characterized those comments as typical of someone with a Washington mentality.
"The vice president, I think, is probably going to make the case that since he spent so much time in Washington, D.C., that only he can be the president," Mr. Bush said. "I'm going to make the case that there is life outside of Washington. That being in the business world is part of an experience necessary to become a chief executive officer. Being the governor of the second biggest state in the union."
"The vice president obviously believes that all wisdom and knowledge emanates out of Washington," Mr. Bush said. "I don't think that. I think all wisdom and all knowledge emanates from the people."
Douglas J. Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, contended that Mr. Bush would be foolish to campaign on his record as governor.
"I don't think that George Bush is much of an expert on wisdom and knowledge," Mr. Hattaway said. "Under his so-called leadership, Texas is one of the most polluted states in the country and one of the worst places to raise a child. That is not the kind of experience that America is looking for on the national level."
Mr. Hattaway also promoted Mr. Gore's proposal to Mr. Bush to forswear soft-money donations, withdraw all television and radio advertising and hold debates twice a week. Mr. Bush has rejected the offer.
On another issue, Mr. Bush said he was considering supporting a move by some Republicans in Congress to repeal a 4.3-cent increase in the gasoline tax enacted in President Clinton's first term. The Republicans have sought to put the administration on the defensive over the recent increase in gasoline prices, which could turn into an important political issue in the high-gasoline-consumption summer vacation season.
Mr. Bush said he agreed with Energy Secretary Bill Richardson that the government should not dip into the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an effort to depress prices. Still, Mr. Bush excoriated the administration for failing to persuade oil-producing countries to export more oil.
"These are countries with which we should have enormous amounts of capital," Mr. Bush said.
In Tennessee, at an airport rally outside Knoxville, Mr. Bush received an endorsement from Senator Fred Thompson, a Tennessee Republican who had been among the few Congressional Republicans to back Mr. McCain.
Mr. Bush also took a few geographic gibes at Mr. Gore, who moved his campaign headquarters to Tennessee from Washington last year when it seemed that he was stumbling.
"I understand that Al is in Texas today," Mr. Bush said. "I wanted to go to his home to campaign today as well, but I couldn't get reservations to Washington, D.C."

HEADLINE: Tribune Co. Is Seen in Talks On Union With Times Mirror

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER 

 BODY:
The boards of the Times Mirror Company, a media giant whose flagship newspaper, The Los Angeles Times, shaped and dominated Southern California for 119 years, and the company that publishes The Chicago Tribune were in advanced talks last night on a possible combination, according to a Times Mirror executive.
Although details were scarce, if the two companies were to combine, either in a merger or acquisition, the result would form a media conglomerate with 11 dailies, 22 television stations and a combined market value of $11.7 billion. 
 A joined company would hardly be the largest in a landscape that includes the merged America Online-Time Warner. Still, it would have enough heft, with $6.3 billion in combined annual revenues in 1999, to keep unwanted suitors at bay and to continue the Tribune Company's acquisition strategy and its push into Internet properties.
An announcement, which could come as early as today after a weekend of intensifying rumors, would end five years in which Times Mirror was reshaped by the cost-cutting zeal and combative optimism of its chief executive, Mark H. Willes. After arriving in the spring of 1995, Mr. Willes presided over the closing of both The Baltimore Evening Sun and New York Newsday and began asset sales that left the company pared largely to its basic newspaper operations.
His determination to see his papers buck the economic tide, win new readers and lead Times Mirror to new profit won Wall Street's favor for his first two years, but this strategy appeared to falter over the last 18 months, as circulation growth came in smaller increments and profits at the flagship newspaper fell below expectations.
Any combination would raise questions about the new company's ownership of both a newspaper and a television station in the markets of New York, Los Angeles and Hartford, an arrangement ordinarily prohibited by federal regulations.
The company's options would include seeking a Federal Communications Commission waiver of this requirement or divesting itself of some of the properties involved -- The Los Angeles Times and KTLA, a Warner Brothers affiliate; Newsday and WPIX, also a Warner Brothers affiliate; and The Hartford Courant and WTIC, a Fox affiliate.

HEADLINE: Danger, Real and Affected, Lingers at Bikers' Jamboree

BYLINE: By JON NORDHEIMER 

DATELINE: DAYTONA BEACH, Fla., March 11

 BODY:
Bike Week 2000 headed for the finish wire on Sunday, leaving a trail of broken bodies and smashed motorcycles.
And that was just on local roads and city streets. The damage on the track at Daytona International Speedway, where professional cyclists zip around a long cantilevered track at speeds well over 100 miles an hour, was nothing compared with the deaths and injuries that resulted when an estimated 600,000 motorcyclists crowded into this Atlantic resort for 10 days of racing thrills and full-throttle partying. 
 By tonight, 13 bikers had died in traffic accidents, local police agencies reported, and scores more had been injured, the highest toll in the 59-year history of the popular event.
"We think it's very alarming," Officer Rick Gregory of the Florida Highway Patrol said about the traffic deaths.
But cyclists said much of the blame for the accidents rested with motorists who ignored or did not notice bikers as they turned or passed other vehicles.
It is a touchy subject for motorcyclists everywhere: accidents caused by car drivers oblivious to bikers. It is also a rationale for the supercharged exhaust blasts that announce the arrival of the bikes.
"Loud Pipes Save Lives" is a ubiquitous decal plastered on helmets and leather jackets.
It seemed impossible, however, for unnerved motorists not to notice bikers on Daytona Beach's sun-washed streets this weekend. The bikers hurtled across the city and the Halifax River bridge connecting the beaches with the mainland, thousands on the move at any time of day.
Some darted in and out of lines of slower traffic, sped along highway shoulders and threaded crowded intersections.
Riders can leave behind a cone of noise that rips the air with ear-splitting thunder, even when accelerating at legal speeds. Eighty-eight-cubic-inch engines, twin Mukini carburetors and Wimmer velocity stacks have a deep-throated gargle at idle, the pride of every biker, and the va-va-ROOM is a sweet melody to their ears.
Aside from accidents, the Daytona Beach police said, this year's crowd was well-behaved and cooperative. "It's an older crowd who come here for the weather, and they're not looking for trouble," said Sgt. Craig Buth.
"There's always some hotheads and some bar fights when people drink too much," Sergeant Buth said, "but this has been the mildest group in my memory."
The outlaw image persists more in legend than in the reality of a conclave like Bike Week, where grandmothers and grandfathers could be seen checking out exhibits of candy-apple red Harley-Davidson Soft riders and chrome-laden Fat Boys beside tattooed younger men and women wearing cutoff leather vests and fringed riding chaps.
"I was one of the bad guys 40 years ago when bikers, for good reason, intimidated people," said Bennie Bauer, a burly man in his mid-50's with a full sandy beard going gray.
"Things have mellowed with the times," he noted, with only a whisper of regret, adding that some of Bike Week's participants showed up riding $40,000 customized bikes.
"Everything down to the last stud on their saddlebags is done for them, and they don't know what they're paying for with their gold credit cards," he said in a good-natured growl as he motioned toward a knot of middle-aged men.
"Take the do-rag off one of their heads and you'll find a doctor or a businessman," he said.
The men stood on a sidewalk on Main Street along with thousands of other spectators, admiring an endless stream of motorcycles and their riders cruising by in raucous procession. In addition, thousands of bikes were parked handlebar to handlebar on both sides of the street, buffed and brushed to a high polish.
What really seemed to be on parade was a national economy that fuels weekend extravaganzas like Bike Week, enabling more than a half-million hobbyists to spend an estimated $300 million on the event.
"You can't have a Harley unless you can afford one," said Debbie Torpey, a self-described computer networker from Rhode Island.
Bike Week, she added, "is just a chance for a lot of middle-class and educated people to dress up and let loose."
Many of the women here, from outward appearances, seemed to buy into the dirty fingernails and rowdy image that bikers acknowledge as a cultural inheritance. There was topless exhibitionism, beer-swilling and macho swagger on parade, as well as skull-and-crossbones insignia and Confederate battle flag regalia.
"But where can you put 600,000 people together for 10 days and have as well-behaved and peaceful crowd as this group?" said Tom Guest, owner of Chopper World, a biker's boutique on Main Street.

HEADLINE: In a Side Effect of Economic Prosperity, White-Collar Crime Flourishes

BYLINE: By JAYSON BLAIR 

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn.

 BODY:
Gary Ahlert, an agent for toy inventors, was in a financial hole. He had lost $400,000 on a plan to market a material to cover artificial limbs. So in 1998, when a potentially lucrative mining deal came up, the pitch, from an apparently credible businessman, seemed worth listening to: invest in an Arizona mine filled with ore that could be used to make cellular telephone batteries.
To get a stake, Mr. Ahlert called a Georgia company whose newspaper advertisements offered "Hard Money. Financing available. $250K and Up." Mr. Ahlert sent the company a $5,000 processing fee for a $3 million capital investment loan, and he and a partner invested about $200,000 of their own money in the mining project. 
 In the end, though, the offer of a loan was fraudulent, the mining project was a scam and Mr. Ahlert and his partner were out about $300,000, all the poorer for having proved a law enforcement adage that a booming economy breeds white-collar crime.
In recent years, while violent crime has plummeted nationwide, white-collar crime, against individuals and small businesses, has skyrocketed, fueled by the economy and made easier by the Internet, law enforcement officials say.
"When there is a lot of money around, they are going to go after the money," said Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney. "So, when you look back and you have high activity in the market, and we have never seen anything like this, you are going to have a lot of fraud.
"The generalization is that the honey attracts the bears," he said.
That has created a difficult situation for a criminal justice system designed to deal, primarily, with street criminals, experts say.
For Mr. Ahlert and others like him, the situation adds insult to injury.
And because it is so hard to track down this kind of scam artist, prove the case and recover the money, prosecutors and the police are sometimes reluctant to try, law enforcement officials said.
According to securities regulators, law enforcement agencies and the National White Collar Crime Center, which studies the phenomenon, white-collar crime has risen 10 percent to 20 percent in the last five years.
And the federal Securities and Exchange Commission, which deals with investment fraud, reported a 20 percent jump in the number of complaints from 1995 to 1999.
Law enforcement officials said the Internet had complicated the situation for them by making it easier for swindlers to quickly steal money and disappear into cyberspace.
Lynne A. Hunt, the chief of the financial crimes section for the Federal Bureau of Investigation, said in an interview that the bureau was investigating more than 26,000 white-collar cases, using more than 2,400 agents. In a decade, bureau officials said, the F.B.I. has more than doubled the number of agents and resources dedicated to white-collar cases.
But, law enforcement officials acknowledged, that is still not enough.
"The advent of new technology has really affected us tremendously," Ms. Hunt said. "Traditional white-collar criminals are now utilizing the Internet to do the same types of crime."
Paul Leighton, a sociologist and professor of criminology at Eastern Michigan University, said it was a difficult transition for law enforcement to make.
"We try to keep this image of the street criminal and the idea of the threat coming from the poor, but we have long had all this white-collar crime, which is much more likely to affect the average American," Professor Leighton said.
Mr. Ahlert is one of those affected. He and his partner spent about $220,000 on the mining and the loan schemes. And, having devoted about another $80,000 to lawyers and investigators in an effort to recover his losses, he has lost his business, is considering filing for bankruptcy and is about to close his office on Main Street here. He and his partner do not even know if they can afford to hire a bankruptcy lawyer, he said.
Perhaps most striking about the case is law enforcement's lack of action.
Mr. Ahlert said he had appealed for help from New York to El Paso, Tex., and had compiled thick files of evidence. In one letter, the men running the mining project claimed to own more than 700,000 tons of ore in Arizona, ore that really belonged to the Department of Defense. One Texas police agency considered pressing charges against one of the men in the mining project, but the El Paso County district attorney's office dropped the charges because prosecutors believed they could not make the case, the police said.
Law enforcement officials said that a case like Mr. Ahlert's was difficult to investigate because white-collar criminals tended to be good at hiding their assets, and generally it was not cost-effective for prosecutors unless they could amass a long list of victims who had been defrauded of much more than what Mr. Ahlert and his partner could reclaim.
Law enforcement officials in Texas, Georgia and New York who have looked at Mr. Ahlert's case said that it appeared he had amassed evidence of fraud, but that it was very unlikely the case would ever go to court.
The officials said that investigating even the simplest white-collar crime case could take years and often involved sorting through thousands of pages of documents. Furthermore, jurors often have a hard time understanding white-collar crime or feeling sympathy for the victims, the officials said.
Given those realities, the officials said, prosecutors are reluctant to proceed with small cases or those that involve few victims. Arrest trends for white-collar crime, which peaked in 1995, suggest that after making a strong push to address the growing number of people being victimized by white-collar crime, the authorities pulled back and began focusing on bigger cases, experts said.
"We have been told by prosecutors that our case was not sexy enough," Mr. Ahlert said. He later added, "We are just two little guys who can't do anything for them."
The increase in white-collar crime is felt most acutely in financial centers, like the New York region, officials said.
"What everyone is worried about is that if the market corrects downward we are going to be swamped with complaints," said Eric Dinallo, a former Manhattan prosecutor who is now chief of the New York State attorney general's investor fraud and securities bureau. "Because people will not even know that they are being scammed until they take their money out."
Ralph Lambiase, the director of the securities division at the Connecticut Banking Department, said more street criminals were moving into the world of white-collar crime because they could get away with it.
"If you mug someone in Connecticut I could get you arrested today," he said. "But if you do white-collar stuff, there are so many ways to hide and shield yourself, and it is much tougher to convict you in front of a jury."
Mr. Lambiase said that experienced people like Mr. Ahlert were increasingly being defrauded.
Mr. Ahlert was hardly new to the workings of the business world. One of the authors of a book called "Selling Your Idea or Invention" (Carol Publishing, 1994), which included a chapter on how to avoid scams, he also worked with Hasbro, Mattel and other major toy companies.
Mr. Ahlert saw the advertisement for the loan in The New York Times classified section in February 1998.
Mr. Leighton, the sociologist, said that people like Mr. Ahlert were easy targets in good economic times because "people feel more comfortable about spending on things that sound risky."
But Mr. Ahlert said his experience had left him far from comfortable.
"It's turned my life upside down," he said as he smoked cigarette after cigarette in the conference room of his office in February.
He said he was living on money borrowed from friends and his daughter, Noel, 33, a schoolteacher.
"I am embarrassed," he said.

CORRECTING THE RECORD; The Articles; Witnesses and Documents Unveil Deceptions In a Reporter's Work
 
On Sunday, May 11, 2003, The Times published a two-full-page accounting of misrepresentations and plagiarism by Jayson Blair, who resigned on May 1 as a reporter. This article was among those described. The description:
 
In Side Effect of Economic Prosperity, White-Collar Crime Flourishes
MARCH 13, 2000
 
FACTUAL ERRORS -- An article about white-collar crime discussed the experiences of Gary Ahlert, who was said to have lost $400,000 on a plan to market a material to cover artificial limbs. That loss, the article added, made him eager to listen to a sales pitch concerning an investment in a mine in Arizona. In a recent telephone interview, Mr. Ahlert said he had not lost money on a marketing plan, though he did fail to collect a licensing fee of some $200,000 in connection with it. He added that the investment involved ore in a warehouse and not in a mine.

HEADLINE: Just What's Going On Inside That Head of Yours?

BYLINE: By SANDRA BLAKESLEE 

 BODY:
Two hundred years ago, the German anatomist Franz Joseph Gall dazzled the public with his science of phrenology, the practice of divining personality and intellect from the shape of the bumps on a person's head. Each localized bump, he said, represented a different characteristic, like secretiveness, acquisitiveness or cautiousness. Later practitioners of phrenology even found locations for pampering children, gluttony and Republican politics.
Now the public is being dazzled once again by a technique called functional magnetic resonance imaging, or F.M.R.I., which is finding precise brain locations related to all sorts of human traits and activities. Among them are hyperactivity centers in children, cells that specialize in the naming of fruits and even a spot in the brain that lights up when a man is sexually aroused. 
 Instead of having their bumps "read" during a Victorian parlor game, people lie down and put their heads inside a powerful magnet device that detects certain molecules in blood flowing through the brain.
When a particular location of the brain is engaged in a cognitive task like naming fruits, it requires extra energy to do its job. The energy arrives in the form of glucose, a simple sugar, that is carried to the fruit-naming location via increased blood flow. This increase in blood flow is then detected by the magnet and depicted on a screen as splotches of light inside the brain.
F.M.R.I. is wildly popular with researchers, thrilled to have a tool that can peer inside the thinking, feeling human brain, said Dr. William Newsome, a professor of neuroscience at Stanford. Unlike standard M.R.I. scans that take static pictures of brain anatomy -- used when doctors search for abnormalities -- functional imaging captures the brain in action as it plans, schemes, imagines and hallucinates.
Thus, each week journals report new studies of ways the brain works based on analyses of F.M.R.I.-based splotches of light inside human heads. But many leading neuroscientists, including Dr. Newsome, now chide colleagues, saying they are misusing a potentially priceless research tool on studies that are often poorly designed and sometimes bordering on the simple-minded.
Most researchers using the new imaging are not asking difficult questions about brain function, these critics say. Instead of asking how the brain works, the technology is being used to answer simple questions that repeat what is already known about the brain or shed little light.
For example, Dr. Newsome said, a researcher might put someone in a scanner, ask the person to count from 1 to 10 and later to count backwards from 10 to 1. The end result: an area for counting backward that lights up as a blob in the brain.
The technology is seductively easy to use, said Dr. Christopher Moore, a postdoctoral fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who is carrying out a number of imaging studies. "You can think of an idea, throw five friends into the scanner overnight and write up your results the next day. People don't have to think very hard about what they're doing."
Just because an area lights up does not mean something important was found, Dr. Newsome said. Nor will researchers understand the brain when the entire map is filled with blobs.
"Localization data provide little insight into the exact nature of the signals encoded in a given structure, the computations being performed and the interactions between different structures," Dr. Newsome said. In other words, knowing where something happens does not reveal how it happens.
Neurologists now know that the brain is a dynamic system of cellular circuits that constantly shift as people go through the day. So the hard part of deciphering brain function is to figure out how cells and widespread circuits are interconnected. How do they fire together to produce behaviors?
Moreover, "there's a dirty little secret that people who publish these studies don't reveal," said Dr. Terry Sejnowski, a neuroscientist at the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif. "The signals they get are highly massaged. It means they clean up their data to make it look good, like applying makeup, for a general audience." The actual data they collect are far more complex, he said, but difficult to decipher.
Another problem is that some parts of the brain seem to light up all the time. The anterior cingulate -- found in front of the brain near the fissure separating the two hemispheres -- is active when people carry out scores of tasks, including, as French researchers found, thinking about sex.
And just because a brain area is correlated with a behavior in F.M.R.I. studies does not mean that it causes the behavior, said Dr. John Moore, a psychology professor at the University of Massachusetts. Imaging studies often make this mistake, he said.
The most serious criticism of the imaging has to do with what the researchers are measuring. Increased blood flow, as shown in splotches of light, may not be an accurate surrogate for brain cell function, some say. Sometimes a signal is picked up by the magnet because the blood is draining into a larger vein and not from cells that are using more energy. Thus, some imaging experiments may measure what veins, not brains, are doing at any given moment.
But all these criticisms do not mean that researchers abandon their projects, Dr. Sejnowski said. "Keep in mind that every time a new technique comes along, a majority of the early studies will be misguided," he said. "F.M.R.I. has shown us things we could not have seen any other way. It is especially useful in studying uniquely human traits like spoken language, reading and sophisticated moral reasoning."
For example, at Princeton Dr. Jonathan Cohen, a neuroscientist, and his colleagues have used the imaging to discover a function for the anterior cingulate that may explain its widespread activation in imaging experiments. Many believe that this part of the brain is responsible for controlled attention or that it responds to errors, Dr. Cohen said. But experiments that could have been done only with F.M.R.I. suggest that its real role is to register conflict. This, in turn, leads a person to pay more attention to what is happening. The distinction is subtle but important, Dr. Cohen said.
Dr. Newsome, an expert in monkey brains, said an imaging experiment in humans got results that conflicted with what was known in monkeys. "We went back and found that the monkey data were incorrect," he said. Thus, human experiments can pay off in unexpected ways.
The imaging technology is improving rapidly, Dr. Sejnowski said. Soon, it may be possible to measure blood flow in tiny areas called cortical columns, clusters of neurons that carry out a single function like detecting edges or direction of motion. It is believed that these columns carry out the basic work of the cerebral cortex, and if researchers can see how they wire and fire together, they will have a better idea of how the brain is organized.
Other improvements include new methods of computer analysis that allow researchers to distinguish meaningful signals out of confusing experiments with the new imaging.
Brain imaging researchers are extremely excited about efforts under way to combine F.M.R.I. with other brain imaging techniques, like magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG). The new imaging is good at finding functional locations but is very slow at picking up signals. While brain cells work in thousandths of a second, functional imaging needs a couple of seconds to detect blood flow. Other technologies like MEG and EEG are fast but not good at identifying where brain activity occurs.
By combining images from all three techniques with the help of powerful computers, researchers hope to produce "movies" of thoughts inside a human head.
Right now, "our knowledge is akin to looking out of the window of an airplane at night," Dr. Newsome said. "We can see patches of light from cities and towns scattered across the landscape. We know that roads, railways and telephone wires connect those cities, but we gain little sense of the social, political and economic interactions within and between cities that define a functioning society." The same is true of efforts to look into the human brain, he said.

HEADLINE: Talks in Japan on Forming Banking Giant

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 13

 BODY:
Sanwa Bank Ltd. is negotiating to join the merger of Asahi Bank Ltd. and Tokai Bank Ltd., a combination that would create the third-largest bank in the world in terms of assets, executives close to the deal said today.
The merged bank would have about 104 trillion yen ($979 billion) in assets, second in Japan to the Mizuho Financial Group, which will come to life this fall when Fuji Bank, the Industrial Bank of Japan and Dai-Ichi Kangyo merge into a bank with $1.3 trillion in assets. The proposed merger of Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank in Germany would create the world's second-largest bank, with $1.2 trillion in assets. 
 It would mean that in less than one year, the ranks of large Japanese "city" banks have started shrinking to five from nine as the industry is forced to reorganize after the financial crisis that gripped the country in late 1997 and early 1998.
Only the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi, which is itself a result of an earlier merger, and Daiwa Bank remain unaligned, and many analysts think Daiwa has to find a partner.
A Sanwa-Asahi-Tokai merger, which is expected to be completed in the fall of 2001, would create Japan's first megabank aimed squarely at Japanese consumers, a group of customers traditionally ignored by Japan's biggest banks. Asahi, which is strong in the Kanto region around Tokyo, and Tokai, which caters to customers in the Tokai region between Tokyo and Osaka, had already announced a merger that is scheduled to take place this fall. Adding Sanwa, which is strong in the Kansai area around Osaka, would give the consolidated bank a solid grip on the most populous part of the country.
"This gives Asahi and Tokai the Osaka piece they've been missing," said James P. Fiorillo, a senior banking analyst at ING Barings. "Geographically, it makes sense."
But Mr. Fiorillo cautioned that while the merger was likely to have long-term benefits, it would be disruptive and difficult over the next three to five years. Like their European and American counterparts, Japanese banks have found consolidation is a bigger challenge than they had anticipated. The struggles that have troubled Citibank and UBS of Switzerland, to name two of the more prominent examples, have become front-page news as they struggle to mesh distinct and often conflicting cultures and management styles.
Japanese banks are no different. Dai-Ichi Bank and Kangyo Bank maintained separate personnel departments for decades after their merger into Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank in the 1970's. And Mizuho, as Dai-Ichi, Fuji and the Industrial Bank will become after their merger, will have three presidents, all of whom are well past what Americans would consider retirement age.
The challenges here may be even greater because Japanese banks face a bigger challenge in getting up to speed with information technology. When the Bank of Tokyo joined with Mitsubishi Bank in 1996, the costs of merging their computer systems was twice what they had anticipated, Mr. Fiorillo said.
"They all have a tendency to overestimate cost-savings and underestimate the costs of merging systems, and that's not limited to Japanese banks," he said.

HEADLINE: The Neediest Cases;
$50,000 Gift Puts Amputee Closer to Dream House

BYLINE: By AARON DONOVAN 

 BODY:
Last April, in a widely publicized assault, Edgar Rivera was pushed in front of an approaching subway train by a stranger with a history of mental illness.
Mr. Rivera, 37, a father of three from the Soundview section of the Bronx, yelled, "Oh, my God!" as he teetered on the edge of the platform for a split second before falling off. Moments later, his legs were run over by the first two 75,000-pound cars of a screeching uptown No. 6 train as he crouched beneath the platform. 
 "He looked like a person who had just come back from Vietnam," said his longtime friend Noel Moreno, who was with him at the hospital on the night of the attack.
Eleven months later, Mr. Rivera, a printer by trade, wants to again provide for his wife, Elizabeth, and their three children, Elijah, 14, Chanel, 9, and Essence, 4. "I'm trying to transition myself back to the work force," he said recently, sitting in his motorized wheelchair. "I'm not going to sit in this chair forever." He practices using his prosthetic legs for a few hours a day.
It's not that Mr. Rivera minds getting back on the subway, which forever changed his life. He often cannot even get out of his building.
His apartment near Bruckner Boulevard is on the top floor of a seven-story public housing building with an unreliable elevator and other obstacles to the disabled. Four times in the months since he was released from the hospital, Mr. Rivera has had to pull himself backward up the dark, graffiti-scarred flights of stairs while his son carried his wheelchair behind him.
Through a $50,000 donation to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, one of the largest to this season's campaign, which ended on Sunday, Mr. Rivera is a good deal closer to his goal of having a handicapped-accessible home built for his family and then returning to work.
The donation, which came in December from DesignWrite, a small company in Princeton, N.J., that arranges seminars for pharmaceutical companies, was directed to provide medical equipment for a disabled person, without a specific individual in mind.
"I wanted to give the money for someone who had a health-related disability and for whom this would allow a return to a high level of functioning," said the president of the company, Mitchell A. Leon.
Though the primary goal of the fund is to serve seven of the oldest and most respected charities in the city with broad assistance, occasionally, donations come with specific terms attached, and where appropriate, the donor's wishes are honored.
When officials of the Community Service Society of New York, one of the seven charities, learned of DesignWrite's gift, they saw a potential match in Mr. Rivera. Solving his housing needs would make a disabled person productive again, just as the donor had envisioned.
Last week, The New York Times Company Foundation, which administers the Neediest Cases Fund, gave its consent.
Mr. Rivera said the city's Housing Authority had done all it could to help him, including retrofitting his apartment with wider doors and giving his building special attention.
"Now that he lives here they always fix the elevator on the same day," said a girl in the building's elevator who would give only her first name, India.
In the months since the assault, Mr. Rivera has forgiven his attacker and has worked to raise money for his dream house.
The Edgar Rivera House Fund has raised about $51,000, largely from people who gave donations of $15 to $100, said Pedro Espada Jr., a former state senator who is coordinating the fund-raising effort.
Mr. Rivera is still searching for a suitable plot of land in his neighborhood. Aiding him are Mr. Moreno and Mr. Espada, who have distributed fliers in the neighborhood and taken to the airwaves to broadcast a phone number to call to make tax-deductible donations, (718) 589-2232.
Mr. Rivera said the house he wanted, with special features like lower cabinets, wider hallways and ramps to the outside doors, would probably cost $200,000. He said his heart was warmed by every donation.
"It's special to me," he said. "These are not people who have benefited from any boom in the economy, and their pockets are not that deep. For them to help me, it shows there are people out there who care, whether it's $5 or $50,000."
After Mr. Rivera builds his house, he would like to build a treatment center for the mentally ill, so that people like the man who pushed him in front of the train can get help.
"You never think about mental illness until it affects your sister or your brother or yourself," Mr. Rivera said. "Unless people with mental illness are treated, the abilities and talents that they have will never be put to use."
 
Previously recorded $6,102,574.70
Recorded yesterday 9,257.00
 
Total $6,111,831.70
 
Last year to date $6,701,122.57

HEADLINE: Rothschild Partner Plans to Set Up OwnFirm

BYLINE: By PATRICK McGEEHAN 

 BODY:
Wilbur L. Ross Jr., one of the best-known investors in troubled corporations, said yesterday that he was leaving the investment bank Rothschild Inc. at the end of the month to form his own investment firm, W. L. Ross & Company.
Mr. Ross, who is 62, said he would sell his partnership interest in Rothschild and buy bigger stakes in investment funds that he has run for the firm and will continue to manage at his new firm. About 20 Rothschild employees who work on the funds in New York, Tokyo and Seoul, South Korea, will join his firm, he said. 
 Rothschild, which is trying to build up its presence on Wall Street, will maintain investments in the funds but will no longer control them. The split will head off possible conflicts between Rothschild's investment banking clients and its own interests as an active investor in stocks and bonds of troubled companies, said Raymond W. Smith, chairman of Rothschild North America.
Mr. Smith said Rothschild managers saw a need for a change as Mr. Ross finished investing one fund and started planning to raise others to invest in distressed securities in the United States and Asia.
"When we went from one fund with a few investments to the potential of one or two more, we saw the possibility out there of a train wreck," Mr. Smith said, referring to potential conflicts of interest.
Mr. Ross declined to say how much he was paying to acquire a majority interest in the general partner of the Rothschild Recovery Fund and the Asia Recovery Fund. The funds, which specialize in investing in companies trying to stave off bankruptcy, or "workouts," have about $450 million in assets.
Despite the long economic boom, "distressed investing" is a thriving practice, Mr. Ross said. The failures are less spectacular these days than they were in the 1980's and early 1990's, but more small and midsize companies failed in this country in 1999 than in any previous year, he said.
The departure of Mr. Ross represents a big change for Rothschild. Having been married to Betsy McCaughey when she ran for governor of New York in 1998 -- they have since filed for divorce -- Mr. Ross has a high profile. But the type of investing he does is, as one person who knows him well said, "distinctly downmarket" for a boutique investment bank with a proud European heritage.
Led by Gerald Rosenfeld, a former partner at Lazard Freres in New York, Rothschild aspires to compete with Lazard as an adviser to chief executives of large corporations. "The new Rothschild will not be a workout shop," Mr. Smith said. "We will provide adult-to-adult advisory services."

HEADLINE: Alfred Neal, 87, an Economist Who Influenced Trade Policy

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS 

 BODY:
Alfred C. Neal, an economist whose interest in developing the global economy influenced United States trade policy in the 1950's and 1960's, died Wednesday. He was 87 years old and lived in Sarasota, Fla.
Dr. Neal, who was one of 11 children, got early exposure to free-enterprise realities when he was 10 years old and began delivering milk, using a pony and a cart, to other families in his hometown of Kentfield, Calif. 
 As a college student, he arrived at the University of California's Berkeley campus in 1929, just weeks before the stock market crash that led to the Great Depression. As a result, Dr. Neal's career became focused around the prevention of similar catastrophes.
While much of the economic theory at the time contended that peacetime economies were doomed to failure, Dr. Neal worked to find alternatives to war that would permit businesses to flourish. Among those was the concept of a controlled recession that would affect some people, but not all, for a brief period of time, and prevent deeper economic problems.
After Berkeley, he studied at the London School of Economics, where Harold Laski, the political theorist and socialist, was one of his professors. Dr. Neal earned his doctorate from Brown University.
During World War II he worked at the Office of Price Administration, moving on to the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston.
Shortly after the war he became the first president of the Committee for Economic Development, a nonprofit organization of economists and company executives that tried to foster progress around the world. He worked with many prominent economists, including Alan Greenspan.
Dr. Neal's sister, Carolyn N. Hedley, said: "The Depression left deep impressions on Al. When he graduated from Berkeley, all of the graduation speakers just spoke in despair and said we couldn't live without wars, that if you didn't have a war raging the economy would go to hell."
With Arthur Burns and Donald Watson, Dr. Neal wrote "Modern Economics," which became widely used in the 1940's as a basic textbook. He retired in 1976 from the Committee on Economic Development, and is credited with influencing the creation of the European Economic Community; helping to rebuild the German and Japanese economies after World War II; and getting the United States off the gold standard. He advised President Dwight D. Eisenhower, President John F. Kennedy and President Lyndon B. Johnson on trade as a member of several commissions.
As head of the Committee on Economic Development, "he was unique in his ability to bridge the gap between the ivory tower and the marketplace," said Sol Hurwitz, who worked with Dr. Neal on the committee. "He brought business leaders together with economists, and the two sides actually developed a healthy respect for one another -- and they learned from one another," Mr. Hurwitz said.
He took pride in the committee's counterparts in Japan, Germany, and Sweden, among other countries, and worked to strengthen them. He also had a knack for persuading the committee's trustees to come to an agreement on something. "He didn't simply wait for a consensus to unfold," Mr. Hurwitz said. "With a twinkle in his eye, he would tell them what the consensus ought to be and would bring them around to his way of thinking."
Outside the office, Dr. Neal, who had no children, loved to entertain with clambakes held in his backyard in Harrison, N.Y., where he lived for many years before moving to Sarasota in 1997. He was also knowledgeable about wine, and shared his insights with his siblings. "After a while, we knew a good Margaux," Dr. Hedley said.
In addition to Dr. Hedley, of Sarasota, he is survived by three sisters, Stella Hadley, of Petaluma, Calif.; Rose Nelson of Azalea, Ore.; and Jeanne Doellstedt of Richmond, Calif.; and two brothers, William, of Novato, Calif., and James, of Santa Rosa, Calif.

HEADLINE: Both Parties In Albany Seek a Halt To Gas Tax

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 13

 BODY:
Responding to the recent jump in the price of gasoline, legislative leaders from both major parties called today for the suspension or even repeal of the state's gasoline tax.
The move by the leaders of the Democratic-led Assembly and the Republican-controlled Senate is intended to defuse what many believe will be a major pocketbook issue in this year's elections. 
 The price of gasoline has risen sharply over the last few months, and many lawmakers here and across the nation fear voter reprisal in November if they do not move to address the situation.
The average price of a gallon of regular unleaded gasoline in the state is now around $1.50 -- up from about $1.25 in December. The main reason for the hike was a move last year by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to force up the price of crude oil by limiting production.
Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani today joined the chorus of lawmakers calling for elimination of the federal and state tax on gasoline. He also sought to put Democrats on the defensive, blaming President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore for the increase.
Mr. Giuliani, who will face Hillary Rodham Clinton in a bid for the United States Senate this year, said that people were being "absolutely economically ruined by the policies of the Clinton-Gore administration with regard to gasoline."
Here in Albany, the situation has led to dueling proposals, with Democrats and Republicans attempting to outflank each other on the politically charged issue in a year when all 211 members of the Legislature are up for re-election. But no matter which party gains the upper hand, consumers are almost certain to benefit in the end, because action by the Legislature seems imminent.
The Democratic speaker of the Assembly, Sheldon Silver, made the opening bid when he proposed eliminating the state's 4 percent sales tax on gasoline during July and August, the height of the summer travel season.
Mr. Silver today urged adoption of the measure, saying it would save drivers $63 million over the two months and encourage them to travel to New York's vacation destinations. Mr. Silver's plan would also give all localities the option to eliminate their local share of the gas tax, which ranges from 3 to 4 percent.
"New York is a tourist state from eastern Long Island to Niagara Falls," Mr. Silver said. "This proposal will make it more attractive for people to get in their cars and vacation in New York."
The Republican majority leader of the Senate, Joseph L. Bruno, immediately countered with his own plan, calling for the complete elimination of the state's sales tax on gasoline. His plan would save motorists about $300 million a year, and it would also allow localities to repeal their portion of the tax.
Mr. Bruno said the state could afford to provide the tax cut because his aides estimate that the state will amass a budget surplus of more than $1 billion when it ends its fiscal year on March 31. "We think that that money really belongs to the taxpayers," Mr. Bruno said of the surplus. "We have to come up with appropriate ways to return it to the taxpayers."
The plan is the latest in a rapidly growing list of tax-cut proposals and spending items that the lawmakers have placed on their agenda even before budget negotiations have begun in earnest. All in all, the measures will likely lead to weeks, if not months, of maneuvering and negotiation between the two houses and Gov. George E. Pataki.
This afternoon, Mr. Pataki, a Republican, said that he, too, favored the elimination of the state's gasoline tax. But he warned that there had to be trade-offs for it in the negotiations over a new state budget.
"Given the strength of the state's economy," he said, "we could afford a tax cut that would get rid of the state's sales tax on gasoline for years to come, but not if we're going to go on spending binges in other areas, not if we're going to pass other massive tax cuts."
The Democrats in the Assembly also called today for a $1.3 billion rise in state spending in aid to schools, nearly triple the increase that Mr. Pataki has proposed, setting the stage for a protracted budget fight.
The Republicans in the Senate, for their part, proposed a $900 million increase in state spending for primary and secondary education, placing even greater pressure on Mr. Pataki to move well beyond the $355 million, or 2.8 percent, increase he has proposed for schools.
In addition, the Democrats are also proposing that the state provide $500 million to help school districts across the state repair or replace crumbling buildings. "It makes sense to invest in our children," Mr. Silver said this afternoon as he unveiled his education plan.

HEADLINE: White House to Publish Accord on China's Entry Into W.T.O.

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN with CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13

 BODY:
Bowing to pressure from Congress, the Clinton administration plans to release the text of the agreement it negotiated on China's entry to the World Trade Organization, as early as Tuesday.
That reverses a decision to keep the accord classified until China completed talks with other countries. 
 Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers demanded that the administration release the agreement, which has been under wraps since it was signed in November, because they say Congress cannot vote on whether to grant China permanent normal trade relations while the W.T.O. agreement remains secret. As part of that accord, the administration asked Congress to give up its annual review of China's trade rights in this country.
The vote on permanent normal trade relations is one of Mr. Clinton's top foreign policy priorities, administration officials have said. Mr. Clinton argues that it is a strategic imperative to get China into the World Trade Organization, where it would be subject to the trading rules that most other nations follow. He has also said that freer trade supports the drive for economic openness in the Communist country.
But the agreement has sparked a legislative battle in Congress. Opponents argue that China does not deserve permanent normal trade relations because it violates human rights standards and continues to threaten the use of force against Taiwan, which China regards as a rebellious province. The Senate looks set to grant normal trading rights, but the vote in the House is still up for grabs, Congressional leaders and administration officials said.
"We are taking away an unreal issue and responding to the concerns of some members who wanted to see this agreement and share it," said Commerce Secretary William M. Daley, who is leading the campaign to persuade Congress to grant permanent normal trade relations. "We are just going to get it out there and everyone will see that it confirms what we have been saying -- this is a great deal for the United States."
The pressure on Congress to vote on the matter also increased today when China vowed to join the trade organization, regardless of what the United States does. If Congress were to deny permanent normal trade relations, and China were to join the world group anyway, Beijing could potentially offer other countries more access to its market than American companies would get.
Until now, China had indicated that it would not join the W.T.O. if it was not freed from the annual review. But, apparently sensing that such a declaration gave Congress the leeway to deny China the rights, without incurring any damage to American companies, Beijing signaled that it would pursue entry anyway.
Permanent trade relations affect bilateral ties, said Shi Guangsheng, China's minister of foreign trade. "It will be up to W.T.O. members to decide" whether China enters the global trade body, he said.
Some members of Congress and executives who have security clearances have been allowed to view the full text. But the administration agreed to China's request to delay releasing it to the general public. That fueled suspicions among some opponents that the accord was not as favorable to United States interests as the administration claimed.
Adding to the sensitivity of releasing the text, the White House enraged China in April when it released onto the Internet the negotiating text of the trade agreement even after Mr. Clinton decided not to close the deal at that time. The administration hoped to try to keep China from backtracking in negotiations. But the release was seen as a blow to Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, who came in for heated criticism domestically for concessions he made.
Clinton administration officials said they agreed to keep the agreement secret because China did not want Europe, Mexico and some 20 other countries that had yet to complete their own bilateral negotiations on China's entry to the trade body to try to one-up the United States. Administration officials said they also did not want extended haggling by other countries to delay China's admission to the trade body.
The administration argues that it has disclosed all the relevant contents of the agreement. But it has only released the headline concessions China made, not the full text.
The full text contains 250 pages of detailed legal language on tariffs, quotas and market access for some 5,000 types of goods and services, administration officials said.
Among the highlights, the pact allows foreign companies to own 49 percent of Chinese telecommunications companies once China joins the W.T.O., a level rising to 50 percent after two years. Foreign banks will be allowed to conduct local-currency business with Chinese enterprises two years after China enters. China will cut the tariffs it imposes on cars to 25 percent from 80 percent or higher by 2006.
China also agreed to raise quotas and lower tariffs on wheat, corn, rice and cotton, products in which the United States is thought to have a substantial comparative advantage.

HEADLINE: Forlorn and Forgotten in the Stacks;
Low Pay Is Driving Many Librarians Out of New York City

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Jane Pierce, manager of the Hamilton Fish Public Library on the Lower East Side, loves almost everything about her job.
She loves holding storytelling time for the dozen elementary school classes that visit each week. She loves leading adult book discussions. And she loves reading aloud at nearby homes for the elderly and at hospices for AIDS patients. She sees being a librarian as being a missionary for books and for reading. 
 But Ms. Pierce has been increasingly bothered by the one aspect of her job she does not love: her salary, which is just $40,000 after 14 years, so low, she says, that she faces eviction from her $1,650-a-month apartment.
"What we earn isn't enough to live on in New York City, with its high rents and living costs," Ms. Pierce said. "I blame the city for the low salaries. Librarians play a vital role in the lives of New Yorkers, whether it's kids, teenagers or adults, and we're not valued enough for that."
It is a complaint that is echoed by her colleagues across the city. If the 1,000 librarians at New York City's public libraries -- the 99-pound weaklings of the municipal labor force -- had a mantra, it would have to be: we get no respect.
They point out that they are paid less than the city's garbage collectors, even though librarians are required to have master's degrees. And they say it is difficult to get anyone to pay attention: many politicians, they say, are too busy listening to the salary complaints of the city's more numerous teachers and police officers, who have far more visibility and public support.
As a result, many librarians are leaving the city's public libraries for bigger salaries in the suburbs and private industry, creating an exodus that library officials say has left New York City facing a critical shortage. Even library administrators acknowledge that librarians are leaving because many make less than $35,000 after five years on the job and often 25 percent or more below levels in the suburbs and industry as a whole. Library officials say the exodus, which parallels that of teachers and police officers, is also depriving the public library system of experienced personnel.
Half of newly hired librarians leave within three years, library system officials say, while the city is unable to attract enough qualified librarians to fill the many openings. One result is that nearly one-third of the branch libraries in the Bronx do not have children's librarians, at a time when experts say the city's schoolchildren need to read more to improve their test scores.
The presidents of the public library systems for the five boroughs have asked Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to give librarians a 15 percent catch-up raise as the city begins contract talks with unions representing nearly 300,000 municipal workers.
"The overwhelming majority of people who run branch libraries earn $37,265, even though they have huge responsibilities," said Ray Markey, president of the union representing 1,800 librarians and library aides in Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island. "They oversee book collections. They manage custodians, security guards and library assistants. They fix computer printers, fix toilets and sometimes even shovel snow. The amount they are paid to do all this is ridiculous, and that's why so many people are walking out the door."
But City Hall officials have already indicated that a 15 percent raise is out of the question, saying it would help erase the city's budget surplus and encourage other city employees to seek similar salary increases.
Many librarians say City Hall's hard line will only accelerate their exodus, especially because the Internet economy is making their salaries all the more uncompetitive. High-paying dot-com companies are snapping up librarians because of the valuable database and research skills they are taught while obtaining their master's degrees.
Upset about the pay, Nancy Trott left her $30,000-a-year job at the Brooklyn Public Library's business branch to take a position paying nearly double that at McKinsey & Company, the consulting firm.
Carol Freitag was paid $32,000 a year to run a branch library in the Rockaways, but last year she jumped to Elmont, N.Y., lured by a $39,000 post as a children's librarian.
And Sean Flynn quit a $32,500 job at the Queens Central library to take a post paying $42,000, nearly 30 percent more, at a library in Setauket on Long Island.
"I loved my job in Queens, and I would still be there except for the salary thing," Mr. Flynn said. "My wife also works at a library in the city, so it was very difficult for us to make ends meet. The pay certainly prevented us from buying a house, and it gave us pause about having kids."
For many librarians, the most dismaying aspect of the city's pay scale is that maximum pay is generally $42,000, even for librarians with 20 or 30 years' experience. In a field that is overwhelmingly female, librarians often assert that sexual discrimination is a factor behind their pay levels.
"By any measurement, New York City public librarians are underpaid," said Paul LeClerc, president of the New York Public Library, which runs the public libraries in Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island. "Librarian salaries start lower and increase slower than they do for librarians in major cities, such as San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago, Cleveland or Philadelphia."
James F. Hanley, the city's labor commissioner, recently told union leaders that the city would grant librarians a sizable raise only if they first agreed to increase productivity, specifically by working longer hours.
John Socha, president of the local representing librarians in Queens, rejected that idea.
"My members would kill me if I agreed to more hours," Mr. Socha said. "Why would we give up the 35-hour week for more money, when the city's union members won the 35-hour week from Mayor Robert Wagner in lieu of raises they gave up?"
Library and union officials say the city's librarians have already raised their productivity in recent years. Use of the 85 branch libraries in Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island grew by 33 percent from 1995 to 1998, while reference inquiries rose by 26 percent, all without an increase in staff.
And many librarians note that in addition to their traditional responsibilities, they now must supervise computer use, help with database research and teach many people how to use the Internet.
Seeing that many well-trained city librarians are ripe for the plucking, libraries in the suburbs and in private industry are recruiting them heavily.
Ms. Pierce said she was starting to pay serious attention to the many fliers that suburban libraries mail to her branch. A recent one came from New Rochelle and advertised an opening for a children's librarian that would pay more than she receives now, even though she heads a thriving branch and manages 10 people.
One recent afternoon, Ms. Pierce read dinosaur stories to a kindergarten class, followed by Langston Hughes poems to a fifth-grade class. Afterward, she helped the fifth graders select biographies for Black History Month and provided Harry Potter books to children whose families would have a hard time buying them.
Ms. Pierce said a big concern among librarians is that low pay has created a shortage of librarians, and as a result, many city libraries have to rely on inexperienced, uncertified assistants.
"One day, a person came in here and said, 'Do you have a book that I can use to explain to my child that I'm going to die of AIDS?' " Ms. Pierce said. "A good children's librarian will know about that. Someone who's not experienced, someone who is not certified, might not be able to help."
The city's librarians face an array of tempting offers. Matthew Willis left the library system to take a $60,000 job at agency.com, an Internet services company. Zahra M. Baird left her $31,000-a-year job running a library branch in the South Bronx to take a $37,000 job as a children's librarian in Scarsdale.
"I didn't choose this career to become rich," Ms. Baird said, "but I didn't take a vow of poverty, either."
Miriam Mandelbaum, a 15-year veteran with two master's degrees, decided to remain at her job in the rare book section at the main New York Public Library, even though Christie's, the auction house, offered her a post paying nearly 50 percent more. She described her work as charity work, made possible only by her husband's salary.
Some are even being lured to the city's own public school system, where the pay for school librarians can rise to $70,000 after 20 years, not to mention summers off.
Carrie Schadle, a Vassar graduate who worked for five years as a children's librarian in East Harlem, recently left to work as a librarian at a school in Williamsburg, attracted by a $5,000 raise that lifted her salary to $37,000.
"I know people who have worked as branch librarians for 25 years and aren't even making $40,000," she said. "It's really hard when all my friends from college are investment bankers and lawyers and are making a quarter million, and I can't even afford to go out to dinner with them."

HEADLINE: Former Gov. Malcolm Wilson, 86, Is Dead

BYLINE: By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Malcolm Wilson, who spent 15 years as Nelson A. Rockefeller's lieutenant governor and one year as governor of New York, died yesterday at his daughter's home in New Rochelle. He was 86.
Long the understudy (and after 36 years of state service in all), Mr. Wilson finally became governor in November 1973, when Mr. Rockefeller resigned, and inherited a growing fiscal crisis. A year later, Mr. Wilson was swept from office in the post-Watergate Democratic landslide, losing to Hugh L. Carey by more than 800,000 votes. 
 Known as a consummate parliamentarian, Mr. Wilson spent 20 years in the State Assembly and then, as lieutenant governor, presided over the State Senate. His command of the rules was such that, even as they complained, Democrats could not help but express admiration for Mr. Wilson's political skills.
Mr. Wilson, who often lapsed into Latin and kept an unfailingly cheerful mien in public, often gave the impression of being too erudite, too much the gentleman and too lacking in concern for appearances to play the roughhouse game of politics. In the mid-1970's, he refused his aides' pleas to give up the narrow ties he wore, then badly out of fashion, insisting that they were still perfectly good.
Gov. George E. Pataki yesterday described Mr. Wilson as "a wonderful human being" who, to his detriment, disdained talk of politics and the careful positioning politicians engage in. He recalled that in the 1974 campaign, reporters peppered the governor with questions about President Ford's pardon of Richard M. Nixon. Mr. Wilson disagreed with the pardon, said Mr. Pataki -- who was then a young lawyer working on Republican campaigns -- but Mr. Wilson would not say so because he thought it irrelevant to his post.
"There were a lot of political issues that could have been attractive and could have helped him in the campaign," Mr. Pataki said. "But what he wanted to focus on was policy."
In 1938, at age 24, Mr. Wilson was first elected to the Assembly from a district that included his hometown, Yonkers. Using skills acquired as a member of the Fordham University debating team and an eye for detail, he became known for his ability to get his bills passed. One of the best known created the Higher Education Assistance Corporation, which made college loans widely available for the first time in the state.
In 1958, he threw in his lot with Mr. Rockefeller, scion of the nation's wealthiest family, who had never before run for office. Mr. Wilson became a political tour guide of sorts, driving Mr. Rockefeller about the state to introduce him to local chieftains eager for a fresh candidate.
Quietly and just the two of them, they made the rounds in Mr. Wilson's own car in order not to flaunt the novice's immense wealth. Mr. Wilson sold his man, who then insisted that Mr. Wilson be chosen as his running mate.
Some looked upon Mr. Rockefeller as a sacrificial lamb to run against Gov. W. Averell Harriman, the Democratic incumbent. But Mr. Rockefeller beat the odds and Mr. Wilson stood in his shadow for the next nearly 15 years. Although the law severely limits the lieutenant governor's executive functions, Mr. Rockefeller put Mr. Wilson's vast expertise and connections to use by making him a member of his inner circle.
Through those years, the two men publicly differed on only one issue of principle. Unlike Governor Rockefeller, Mr. Wilson -- a Roman Catholic -- opposed the legalization of abortion. He was generally considered a conservative but, rejecting such political labeling, he defined himself as "an economic conservative and a human-rights liberal."
Forever loyal, he never spoke ill of the ever-upward spiral of spending and debt under Mr. Rockefeller that led to the fiscal crisis, though friends and aides said it doubtless contradicted his own instincts.
As the enduring No. 2, Mr. Wilson always presented a proper, for the most part amiable, face to the world. At the same time, it was no secret in Albany that he would not mind dropping the "lieutenant" from his title once Mr. Rockefeller moved on to indulge his well-known higher ambitions. As he waited, Mr. Wilson presided over the Senate with a ready gavel and an intimidating command of Robert's Rules of Order.
Aside from his mastery of the state budget, Mr. Wilson had a hand in shaping the Governor's priorities. It was he who persuaded Mr. Rockefeller to press for federal revenue sharing to help states that were in financial straits, an idea Mr. Rockefeller successfully pushed after Mr. Nixon won the White House in 1968.
At age 59, Mr. Wilson, by then a grandfather, got his big chance when Mr. Rockefeller, his presidential ambitions thwarted, grew bored with state government and resigned. (The following year, President Ford named Mr. Rockfeller as his vice president).
One of Mr. Wilson's worries as governor was the growing practice by local governments, particularly New York City, of financing local government expenses with a dubious array of fiscal gimmickry. At one point, he admonished, there must come the day of reckoning, as New York City soon learned when it came near financial collapse.
But the first piece of the fiscal crisis to break into view occurred in Mr. Wilson's own bailiwick, at the state's Urban Development Corporation, which flirted with bankruptcy -- an issue Mr. Carey used against him in the 1974 campaign. After taking office, Mr. Carey accused his predecessor of having tried to hide the severity of the crisis, and asserted that Mr. Wilson's outgoing administration had granted him "limited access and little rapport" during the transition.
After losing office, Mr. Wilson was at first an active political fund-raiser and a sought-after speaker at party functions. But increasingly, liberal Rockefeller Republicanism fell from favor, and Mr. Wilson faded from the political scene. He returned to his law practice and served as chairman and chief executive officer of the Manhattan Bank for Savings from 1977 to 1986.
His wife, the former Katharine McCloskey, died in 1980. In 1991, Mr. Wilson underwent surgery for an aortic aneurism, then experienced serious complications. Since then, he had lived with his daughter Katharine Wilson Conroy, a lawyer and former member of the New Rochelle City Council. In addition to Ms. Conroy, he is survived by another daughter, Anne Matthews of Freehold, N.J., and six grandsons.
Charles Malcolm Wilson was born Feb. 26, 1914, in New York City, one of four children in a family of Irish and Scottish ancestry. His first name eventually disappeared, to distinguish him from his father, Charles H. Wilson, a patent attorney who had made an unsuccessful run for the Assembly in 1912. His mother, Agnes, served as a member of national Republican women's groups and as a district party leader in Yonkers, where the family moved in 1920.
Malcolm Wilson graduated from Fordham Preparatory School at 15, Fordham College at 19 and Fordham Law School at 22, in 1936. He spent his entire legal career with the White Plains firm that would become Kent, Hazzard, Jaeger, Greer, Wilson & Fay, becoming a partner in 1946.
He enlisted in the Navy in 1943 and oversaw a gun crew on an ammunition ship that shuttled across the Atlantic and supported the landings at Normandy and Anzio. He kept his Assembly seat, winning re-election in absentia, and returned to New York in 1945 with the rank of lieutenant j.g.
As a government official, aides said, Mr. Wilson was addicted to detail and studied tomes of reports that caused lesser mortals to doze off. His discourses on the affairs of state tended to be soporific, although no Albany insider would have disputed his ability to grapple with complex issues.
In fact, Mr. Wilson had a distaste for the oversimplification so common to politics. Beware of simple answers, he warned, quoting the Swiss historian Jacob Burkhardt: "The essence of tyranny is the denial of complexity."

U.S. WILL ENDORSE EUROPEAN NOMINEE TO LEAD THE I.M.F.

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13

 BODY:
President Clinton told Germany's chancellor today that he would accept Horst Kohler as the new head of the International Monetary Fund, ending a heated diplomatic contest over who would lead the institution that battles global financial crises.
Mr. Clinton's apparently reluctant support virtually ensures that Mr. Kohler, a former German finance official who is now president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, will win the post of managing director of the I.M.F. 
 But the rift that opened during the selection process -- during which Mr. Clinton refused to support Germany's first nominee and developing nations tried to install their own candidate -- leaves open many questions about how the much-criticized institution will change, and about the tradition-bound method by which its leaders are chosen.
In interviews today, senior administration officials who had been far from enthusiastic about Mr. Kohler last week began to speak of his strengths, describing him as "an important player" in the economic unification of Germany and the creation of the European Monetary Union.
Just a few weeks ago, his name was not even on the short list of finance ministers, central bankers and European politicians judged by the United States Treasury and European officials to have the political standing and judgment for the job.
Privately, Clinton administration officials had sent signals that they were partial to the candidate Italy was pushing for the job, Treasury Secretary Giuliano Amato. Italy had been the most vocal opponent of Mr. Kohler, but agreed to support him at a meeting today of European Union finance ministers.
Washington's approval seemed driven more by a sense that Mr. Clinton could not turn down a second German candidate, and one endorsed directly by the German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, according to administration officials close to the internal deliberations.
Just two weeks ago, Mr. Clinton rejected the selection of Caio Koch-Weser, Germany's deputy finance minister. That led one of Mr. Schroder's top advisers, Michael Steiner, to complain that the United States "sees its global role not only in the military area but also in setting the rules of globalization through the I.M.F."
But in the end, Germany, an essential NATO ally, won its struggle. Mr. Clinton and Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, according to the administration officials, concluded that they could not violate the 50-year unwritten rule that allows Europe to fill the I.M.F. post while the United States appoints the head of the World Bank.
The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said Mr. Clinton had spoken to Mr. Schroder this afternoon from Cleveland, where he was promoting his plan for expanded prescription drug coverage.
"The president told Chancellor Schroder that the United States was prepared to support Mr. Kohler as the new head of the I.M.F.," Mr. Lockhart said. "The president and Schroder agreed that Mr. Kohler should come to Washington to meet with the I.M.F. board, particularly with the developing countries," Mr. Lockhart said. They also agreed that Mr. Kohler "should retain the talented management team at the I.M.F."
That was thinly veiled code to suggest that Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 official of the bank and the man promoted by African and Middle East nations for the top job, should remain in place. Mr. Fischer, formerly head of the economics department at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, was the I.M.F. architect of the bailout of Asia during the economic crisis that began in 1997.
Mr. Clinton's decision came only hours after all 15 nations within the European Union today endorsed Germany's new candidate.
As the administration has learned in the last five years or so -- first when the Mexican peso collapsed, then when the Asian tigers, Russia and Brazil saw their economies implode -- the United States has an enormous stake in who heads the I.M.F. In return for providing emergency loans and arranging bailouts, the fund can command great changes in a country's economic policies. Sometimes it is heeded, as it was by Thailand and South Korea, two of its biggest success stories. Sometimes its prescriptions touch off political instability; it was widely criticized for hurting Indonesia's poor while saving the banks that lent the country money. Without question, the I.M.F.'s prescriptions in Indonesia sped the departure of its longtime dictator, President Suharto.
In Russia, however, the fund has met considerable political resistance and little success. It has repeatedly delayed disbursing funds until Moscow fulfilled its economic commitments. And Mr. Kohler will find himself maneuvering with Russia's acting president, Vladimir V. Putin. That will be an important test because Mr. Kohler's current institution, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, watched loan after loan to Russia go bad, and often found itself at the losing end of negotiations with Russian authorities.
Mr. Kohler presided over a large-scale write-off of Russian loans in 1998 that led to the bank's first-ever yearly loss. But it has since returned to profitability, and Mr. Kohler has sought to refocus the bank on small-business loans and smaller-scale development projects since then.
Nonetheless, Mr. Clinton clearly endorsed him before hearing his views on the I.M.F.'s future. In the conversation with Mr. Schroder, one official said: "The president said we need to engage about what his vision will be. And Schroder said 'We'll do it.' "
Mr. Kohler, 57, never topped the list of European candidates to head the I.M.F. When Michel Camdessus announced his retirement last fall, Mr. Kohler's name was among those briefly floated among European officials. But Germany decided to push Mr. Koch-Weser. One reason was almost certainly domestic politics: Mr. Koch-Weser was chosen personally by Mr. Schroder to serve as the No. 2 official in the finance ministry, while Mr. Kohler held the same job under Helmut Kohl, the longtime German chancellor whom Mr. Schroder defeated.
Mr. Kohler comes closer to meeting the litmus test the Treasury Department set for any new I.M.F. director. He has a higher political stature than Mr. Koch-Weser, Clinton administration officials said. He was the financial point man during the unification of East and West Germany, overseeing West Germany's program to quickly integrate the East by unifying the currency on terms favorable to the East and channeling tens of billion dollars in development aid to help development in the Eastern half of the country.
Mr. Kohler was also the top international official in the German finance ministry when European countries agreed on the terms of monetary union in 1992. That showed he had much more experience than Mr. Koch-Weser dealing with currency matters -- a crucial part of the I.M.F.'s duties. Mr. Koch-Weser focused almost exclusively on internal management and poverty relief programs during his 25 years at the World Bank.
Left out of the running was Mr. Fischer, the I.M.F.'s deputy director. In an interview today, he said, "I intend to remain" in that post. He would probably be running the I.M.F. if he did not hold a U.S. passport, and Mr. Clinton was unwilling to have a showdown with Europe over ending the longtime practice that the I.M.F. head would come from the Continent.
Mr. Kohler's likely appointment comes at a time when the I.M.F. is under attack from Republicans in Congress, some of whom are pushing for a drastic streamlining of the fund's operations.
A Congressional commission headed by Allan H. Meltzer, a monetary policy expert at Carnegie Mellon University, issued a report last week that calls for the fund to eliminate many of its lending programs and sharply limit its role as a de facto world central bank.
Clinton administration officials were highly critical of the report, and it is unlikely that all the changes in the report will be put into practice. But the next leader of the I.M.F. will have to grapple with members of Congress who control how much money the United States, the largest I.M.F. donor, contributes.
"Congress has lost confidence in the I.M.F.," said Representative Doug Bereuter, a Nebraska Republican, who serves on the House Banking Committee. "The I.M.F. has been unwilling to admit its errors but sooner or later it will have to."

HEADLINE: City Contracts For Workfare Are Criticized

BYLINE: By ERIC LIPTON 

 BODY:
City Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi objected yesterday to $469 million in welfare-to-work contracts awarded by the Giuliani administration, saying they raised the appearance of "corruption, favoritism and cronyism." But he acknowledged that he had no power to block them on those grounds, and the administration said it would move forward with the contracts.
"We are not alleging criminality, we are not alleging bribery, we have no evidence of that," Mr. Hevesi said. "We are talking about a corruption of this process, of favoritism, for whatever motive we don't know." 
 Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani dismissed the comptroller's charges in a statement issued after Mr. Hevesi's news conference, suggesting that they were merely the latest move in Mr. Hevesi's bid to build his profile for a possible run for mayor.
"The comptroller's motivations here are purely political and his allegations are phony," Mr. Giuliani said. "These are excellent contracts that will move thousands of people from welfare to work."
The city comptroller's office oversees the granting of city contracts, but the City Charter allows the mayor to override the comptroller when the comptroller's objections involve corruption, and aides said Mr. Giuliani would exercise that right.
The 17 contractors are being hired to reshape, consolidate and run the city's welfare, job training and employment programs, and are to find jobs for about 80,000 over the next three years. There are about 600,000 city residents on welfare, about two-thirds of them children. In 1995, the year Mr. Giuliani began his campaign to reduce the welfare rolls, more than 1.1 million residents were on public assistance.
In objecting to the contracts, Mr. Hevesi said the Giuliani administration had illegally circumvented rules that required competitive bidding.
The comptroller also contended that the company that won the biggest share of the contracts -- Maximus, of McLean, Va. -- had been improperly granted special access by the Giuliani administration. All the while, Mr. Hevesi said, Maximus improperly planned to grant a large piece of its award to a company run by Richard J. Schwartz, a former senior adviser to the mayor on issues including welfare.
As a result, for only the second time in his six years in office, Mr. Hevesi formally raised the allegation of corruption and refused to sign off on the contracts.
The comptroller, already anticipating that the mayor intended to override his objections, said yesterday he was prepared to forward his findings to other authorities for investigation. An associate said these could include the United States attorney, the city's Department of Investigations and the Manhattan district attorney's office.
"We are not talking about $20 or $200,000," Mr. Hevesi said. "We are talking about, with extensions, close to a billion dollars in contracts being presented to this office. The three-year deals in question can be renewed for an additional three years.
"This will lead to independent investigations outside this office," he said. "Others will have to pursue what happened and when and where and who benefited and who didn't benefit in this process."
A month ago, Mr. Hevesi formally rejected the first 3 of the 17 welfare-to-work contracts and threatened to hold up payments, if necessary, to stop them. Yesterday, 31 days after the mayor's office resubmitted the original three contracts and 14 others, Mr. Hevesi said he was required by law either to approve them or object to them. But the Giuliani administration last week submitted documents answering most of the comptroller's outstanding questions, and so the only grounds Mr. Hevesi had to object to the contracts were his allegations of corruption.
Deputy Mayor Anthony P. Coles said yesterday that Mr. Giuliani would override Mr. Hevesi's objection within 24 hours.
Yesterday, the mayor also vetoed two bills related to welfare that were recently passed by the City Council: one would create a government-subsidized employment program giving temporary jobs to 2,500 welfare recipients each year; the other would allow welfare recipients to file grievances if they encountered dangerous working conditions or other problems in their assigned jobs. A City Council spokesman said the council would override the vetoes.
The welfare-to-work program has been a centerpiece of Mr. Giuliani's efforts to reduce the welfare rolls. The city, in fact, has already started to give work to the 17 contractors. As of Wednesday, the city had referred about 5,000 unemployed city residents to the contractors, and 1,010 had already been placed in jobs, at a possible cost to the city of $1.62 million, city officials said.
To date, the companies have been doing the work on speculation, given that the Giuliani administration has not had the ability to pay them. Several companies have been threatening to curtail their services unless the payments are processed quickly.
The contracts in question are broken into two groups: $145 million over three years is slated for firms that are supposed to quickly place welfare recipients into clerical, data entry, custodial or other types of jobs; an additional $320 million over three years is for companies that handle harder-to-place clients. In these more difficult cases, the welfare recipients would first be offered job training or counseling.
The contractors are to be paid three months of start-up costs, but after that they only receive payments if their clients are placed in jobs, with the compensation increasing if the clients hold the jobs for more than three months, a provision that both Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Hevesi support.
Mr. Hevesi's objections to the contracts were divided into three main categories. He said the city had improperly skipped its normal competitive bidding procedure, citing what Mr. Hevesi called false deadlines for the start of the program. The city also offered to pay two contractors, including Maximus, $400 more for each client placed in a job than the companies had asked.
Finally, Mr. Hevesi said, as far back as January 1999, three months before documents show that the city began to formally consider inviting bids for the project, Maximus and top officials at the Human Resources Administration were already involved in detailed discussions of the project. The early meetings with the city allowed Maximus to prepare a much more extensive proposal, Mr. Hevesi said, giving it an advantage over the other bidders.
Mr. Hevesi also said that, while Maximus had indicated it intended to hire a firm run by Mr. Schwartz, it did not disclose a partnership agreement to automatically assign to Mr. Schwartz's Opportunity America consulting firm 30 percent of the $104 million Maximus now expects to be paid over the next three years.
Mr. Schwartz, who left the Giuliani administration in 1997 to found Opportunity America, said his company's involvement in the Maximus bid had been disclosed from the start.
"Opportunity America has behaved in a totally appropriate manner throughout this process," Mr. Schwartz said.
He added that his firm is a subcontractor for Maximus, and not a partner, and that the documentation Opportunity America filed with the city reflected that.
"I have all the documentation to prove that we're a subconcractor," Mr. Schwartz said.
Officials at Maximus disputed the allegations of impropriety yesterday, saying they welcomed any additional investigation of the process.
"The procurement process was above reproach," said Bill Macfadden, Maximus' New York City project director. "It was open, fair and competitive."

Tourism Expo Canceled

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
Even some of upstate New York's major tourist destinations have better places to be this spring.
Lack of interest by tourist attractions led the Mohawk Valley Chamber of Commerce to cancel its Spring Tourism Expo, according to the chamber's president, Robert Fowler. 
 "No one wanted to participate," Mr. Fowler said Friday. "We boast that we have 100 tourist attractions and we got 34 that said yes."
That is despite the fact that the area, which includes tourist destinations from Little Falls to Verona, is struggling with economic decline.
The exposition attracted 6,800 people last year. This year's show had been scheduled for March 18-19 at the Mohawk Valley Convention Center.

Aid for Napier Workers

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
About 300 workers who lost their jobs when the Napier Company in Meriden, Conn., abruptly closed last October have received more than $710,000 in federal aid.
The 124-year-old jewelry company was shut down by Victoria & Company of Rhode Island, which bought the Meriden site last year, in an effort to cut costs. 
 The grant from the Department of Labor, announced on Saturday by United States Representative James H. Maloney, a Waterbury Democrat, will extend the time some workers can collect unemployment benefits from 6 to 18 months. The grant will also pay for job training and counseling, college courses and relocation if necessary.

HEADLINE: MULTIMEDIA DEAL: A New Approach to Old Media;
Tribune Company Feeds Content to Diverse Outlets

BYLINE: By DAVID BARBOZA 

DATELINE: CHICAGO, March 13

 BODY:
The announcement today that the Tribune Company was acquiring the Times Mirror Company elicited this response from Esther H. Dyson, the high-technology pundit: "So one newspaper buys another: so what?"
For Ms. Dyson, a seer of the new economy, the merger amounted to a marriage of survivors of a fading world. The parent company of The Chicago Tribune, which resides in a stately but fortress-like Gothic tower, is tying the knot with the parent company of The Los Angeles Times and Newsday, which has been run by a former General Mills executive, Mark H. Willes. 
 Yet here in Chicago, the Tribune Company has been quietly transforming itself in recent years into what its executives say is a new media company that funnels old media content to television, cable, radio and the Internet. Some journalists fret that these ventures have tarnished the company's newspapers, an accusation that corporate executives stoutly deny.
Before the deal, the Tribune Company had 22 television stations, reaching more than a third of United States households. There were four radio stations, an entertainment unit, a venture capital arm and an educational publishing unit.
The company was an early investor in America Online and Excite and owns a 25 percent stake in the WB television network and a 29 percent stake in cable television's Food Network.
Acquiring Times Mirror would add three of the nation's best known newspapers to that portfolio: Newsday on Long Island, The Los Angeles Times and The Baltimore Sun. The Tribune Company's coast-to-coast empire would include a newspaper and television station in three of the nation's largest markets: New York, Chicago and Los Angeles.
"We think we're creating the premier multimedia company in America," said John W. Madigan, the Tribune Company's chairman, president and chief executive. "We'll have a major presence in the three largest markets in the United States, and that presence will be defined by taking what are essentially local-market media companies and putting them together into a national footprint."
Shares of the Tribune Company dropped $6.375, to $30.8125, on news of the deal. But the company has been a winner on Wall Street in recent years largely because it is trying to meet the convergence of old media and new media head on -- even if not everyone is noticing.
"They're very smart guys up there in Tribune Tower," said Robert A. Davis, a former assistant metropolitan editor at The Chicago Tribune. "They look like ramrod flannel wearing suits, and they are. But they're smart. There's a long reputation of conservatism, but these guys are out there rocking and rolling."
The deal, however, took many here by surprise, even those within the Tribune Company. The company had been betting heavily on television and Internet properties, and now, a decade after selling The Daily News in New York, it was buying up huge newspaper properties in some of the nation's biggest markets.
Executives of the Tribune Company say the merger fits their larger plan, which is to leverage old media newspapers, with their prized content, into new media television, cable and Internet outlets.
Top executives say the new company, will have the influence to sell advertising nationally for its regional newspapers, television stations and its Internet outlets. The company will also create cross-marketing agreements among its properties and find synergies in a world-class news gathering force.
"The more I think about it, the more this furthers the path they began around 1989 to control as much content as humanly possible," said Jeff Borden, a reporter at Crain's Chicago Business who has covered the Tribune Company for more than a decade.
The new media format is also raising some concerns among journalists who worry that the quality of newspapers will suffer in a world driven by profits and entertainment.
The Tribune Company has a reputation not only for being a fierce cost-cutter and union buster but for putting greater and greater emphasis on entertainment and business.
Some reporters and editors in Chicago have complained about the company's drive to merge its newspaper, television and Internet properties into one media conglomerate, in which television reporters share office space with newspaper reporters, story ideas are shared among once competing papers and bureaus are consolidated.
In Washington, the Tribune Media Center houses reporters and editors from The Chicago Tribune, The Orlando Sentinel and several television stations; in The Tribune newsroom, CLTV, a Chicago cable station owned by the company, has set up shop to interview reporters live.
William J. Drummond, a professor of journalism at the University of California at Berkeley who once worked at The Los Angeles Times, said he was troubled by the interest in profits.
"It would really be distressing if the culture of The Los Angeles Times, even with its recent lapses, were hit by more attempts to make it efficient; if they were going to make the Times reporters cooperate with other newspapers and television stations in the name of the corporate glory of the parent," Professor Drummond said.
Others say the Tribune Company is remaking itself into an entertainment company. The company's entertainment arm used to produce Geraldo Rivera's daytime talk show, and these days, reporters at The Chicago Tribune often joke about how "Buffy the Vampire Slayer," the popular WB TV show that runs on many Tribune Company stations, fattens their paychecks.
Indeed, in a conference call with reporters, executives of the Tribune Company talked about how their new enterprise would create a platform for new e-commerce businesses that would sell everything from travel destinations to information.
Scott C. Smith, publisher of The Chicago Tribune, however, said the company was not surrendering its integrity or chipping away at good journalism. It was, he said, simply finding new synergies and a new way to deliver valuable content to readers and consumers.
"Yes it's true the Tribune newspaper margins have improved significantly over the last decade," he said. "But we have more journalists today than we had a decade ago -- and more talented ones."
There are no plans to develop a national newspaper, but the company wants a world-class news gathering organization in which newspaper, television and Internet reporters share information and real estate and even cross into one another's space.
Mr. Smith said The Los Angeles Times was planning a renovation of its newsroom, and the Tribune Company had already suggested that its KTLA television affiliate look at the plans to see whether it wanted to incorporate itself into the Los Angeles newsroom.
Wall Street analysts, surprised by the deal because the Tribune Company had been concentrating on broadcast and Internet properties, said, however, that the Times Mirror newspapers meshed nicely with the Tribune Company's plans.
"To draw an analogy, you've got radio and television companies trying to grab broadcast spectrum, I see this as trying to grab spectrum," said John Morton, who covers the newspaper industry as an independent analyst.
The new company will have papers with a nationwide circulation of 3.6 million, and its television stations will reach more than 38.4 million households. On the Internet, it already ranks as one of the top 20 news and information Web sites with more than 3.4 million visitors each month.

HEADLINE: Florida's Vouchers a Spur To 2 Schools Left Behind

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN 

DATELINE: PENSACOLA, Fla.

 BODY:
When Gov. Jeb Bush initiated the nation's boldest voucher experiment last year, it was clear that its fate would depend on two things: the progress of the students using taxpayer money for private-school tuition and the impact on the struggling schools they left behind.
In their Roman Catholic school plaids and pleats, the voucher children stand as symbols of the program's promise: One fourth-grade boy has finally learned to read and a third grader is mastering cursive writing; their parents consider the vouchers a blessing. 
 But in the debate roiling American cities over whether vouchers are the greatest threat to public schools or the best hope to solve the problems that plague them, the more vexing issues arise at two elementary schools here in an impoverished corner of the Florida Panhandle.
Florida is the first state to grant vouchers to students whose schools fail standardized tests and it will probably soon have the nation's largest voucher program. It is the model for a national program proposed by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the likely Republican presidential nominee.
The two schools here, A. A. Dixon and Spencer Bibbs, were the first in the state to lose students to vouchers when the law took effect last summer because so many of their pupils performed so poorly on the tests two years running. While it may take years to gauge the program's success, its impact is already apparent at the two schools, nestled in two of the state's poorest neighborhoods.
With grants from the district and the state, the schools have hired more teachers, reduced class size, stretched the school year by 30 days and added afternoon tutoring.
They have also shriveled the curriculum, emphasizing subjects that will help improve test scores, while shunning science and social studies -- subjects not covered by the tests. They are drilling children on reading, writing, math and, inevitably, test-taking tips. Field trips have disappeared, replaced by events like a recent Saturday "test-taking fair."
"We're leaving out important parts of the education process," lamented Dixon's principal, Judith O. Ladner. "They're going to learn what's on a test. But are they going to learn to be able to cooperate with each other in the business world? Are they going to be creative thinkers?"
At its core, the question over vouchers is whether a market-based approach, embraced in so many sectors today, is appropriate for education. The notion of rating schools based on the standardized test scores of students is sweeping the nation as nearly every state strives to hold teachers and principals more accountable. But beyond providing an escape for children trapped in failing schools, vouchers may be shifting the student-teacher relationship in ways that some find troubling.
"When a low-performing child walks into a classroom," said Jim May, superintendent here in Escambia County, "instead of being seen as a challenge, or an opportunity for improvement, for the first time since I've been in education, teachers are seeing them as a liability."
First proposed by the economist Milton Friedman in 1955, vouchers have exploded from a pilot program of 300 students in Milwaukee in 1990 to 63,840 children in 31 states today, most from low-income families. That includes 11,538 students, mainly in Cleveland and Milwaukee, using public money to attend private schools, and about 70 small programs around the country that are less controversial because they are financed by philanthropists.
Florida has only 53 students using vouchers for private schools and another 85 who transferred to higher-performing public ones.
But school grades being released in June could expand the program to as many as 60,000 students in 78 schools. Those schools received "F's" last year because of poor performances on the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Tests and students would be eligible for vouchers if they are rated "F" a second time.
Though they touch only a fraction of the nation's 52 million schoolchildren, vouchers are among the most contentious issues today in cities including New York, and form a point of dissension between Mr. Bush of Texas and Vice President Al Gore, his expected Democratic opponent.
More than 25 state legislatures are considering voucher plans -- many, like Florida's, linked to standardized test performance -- while constitutional challenges to programs here and in Cleveland are expected to land before the United States Supreme Court.
The philosophical gap is wide: Opponents fear vouchers would drain resources from troubled schools, leaving them worse off for the students who stay. Advocates say that vouchers give poor children opportunities akin to the affluent and would force weak schools to improve.
Research so far has been murky, as partisans pick apart each others' studies.
Over all, experts believe that students using vouchers to attend private schools score slightly higher on math and reading tests than the students who remain in public schools.
But "the great question that nobody can really answer," said John F. Witte, a University of Wisconsin political scientist who has published a book on the Milwaukee voucher program, is, "Does it create competition and does it create change?"
Things are certainly different this year at Bibbs and Dixon, schools where nearly all the students are black and poor enough to qualify for free breakfast and lunch programs.
Hallways at Bibbs were lined with posters of sample answer sheets for the state assessment tests and with efforts to redefine the dreaded "F" label: "We are Fueled, Focused and Fighting." At Dixon, there is a trophy case of prizes -- Pokemon toys, a Sony PlayStation, a television -- for those who score best on the tests.
Inside every classroom, the mission is clear.
In Vickie Ward's fifth-grade class, there was an orange F.C.A.T. math workbook on every desk as Ms. Ward drilled the students on writing multidigit numbers in standard form -- numerals -- and word form. Fifth-grade math scores count toward the school grade.
Rosa Dean's fourth graders were practicing a reading comprehension exercise; their reading scores help determine the school's rating.
"You do the process of elimination," advised Mrs. Dean, sounding like the test-preparation gurus who coach teenagers for the College Boards. "You have four choices; try to get it down to two choices."
Teachers at Bibbs and Dixon, and the parents who spurned the vouchers, blame the F's largely on demographics: many of their families are headed by single mothers or grandmothers on welfare with little education; kindergartners arrive never having picked up a book, not knowing the alphabet.
"I have a bicycle, and the man next door has a Cadillac," said Georgia Smith, a kindergarten teacher at Bibbs. "If you're going to compare the distance I can travel with the man who has a Cadillac, well, let me swap vehicles with that man, and then see how far I can travel."
Indeed, across Florida, no school where less than 10 percent of the students qualify for free lunch scored below a C, and no school where more than 80 percent of the students qualify scored above a C.
Many Florida educators want the results to take account of socioeconomics, or focus on a school's improvement from year to year, rather than judging all schools on the same criteria.
Tom Gallagher, the state's education commissioner and the architect of the school-grading plan along with the governor, said improvement would help dictate school grades as soon as the assessment tests are old enough to track annual progress. But "our expectations are the same for a first grader in Coral Gables as it is for Bibbs or Dixon," he insisted. As for whether test preparation has squeezed out enrichment programs and even basics like science, Mr. Gallagher is not worried: Nobody can pass the test, he noted, without reading its directions.
"You can't operate in our society if you can't read, write and do math," he said. "You can operate in our society if you haven't been on a field trip, if you haven't had any art this year, if you haven't been to gym, and if you haven't had any science."
Though parochial students do not take the tests, those using vouchers must. So there were no signs of the test -- no posters in the hallways, no mention of multiple-choice bubble techniques -- at Little Flower, one of the five private schools, four of them Catholic, where former Bibbs and Dixon students have enrolled.
In classrooms arrayed around a central courtyard with a fountain, fifth graders were writing persuasive letters, while first graders put on a puppet show.
"Last year, it was nothing but work sheets," said Patricia White, whose daughter, Katrina English, took a voucher. "Now, homework every night, books, essays to write. We just finished a report with poster board and such -- we didn't even leave the house last Saturday!"
Teachers say they have tweaked the curriculum -- cutting spelling tests to 10 words a week from 20 for one boy -- but that the acculturation process was not much different than with other public-school transfers.
Many voucher families had always wanted to send their children to private school but could not afford it; some were just fed up with what they saw as behavior problems and low expectations at Bibbs and Dixon.
Andy Cameron, whose son, Ray, was repeating fourth grade this year at St. Michael's, called Dixon "a giant sewer" where "the academic atmosphere was nonexistent."
Ms. White said she volunteered in Katrina's class every day last year, and saw third graders still struggling to identify letters; even if vouchers are ruled illegal, she will keep Katrina in Catholic school.
"I got cable; it'll go," Ms. White said. "The telephone? That's a luxury. I will get a night job. I'll do what I have to do. She's getting a better education."
In this very enthusiasm over the children's progress lies a potential pitfall. Whether vouchers are targeted by income, as in Milwaukee or Cleveland, or by school performance, as here in Florida, they are typically seized by families with relatively more money and better educational backgrounds; the most disenfranchised of the disadvantaged groups stay behind, only making the educational challenge steeper.
As Bibbs and Dixon struggle to get off the "F" list, principals and teachers are working overtime, and children are focused as they study in small groups, aided by an influx of volunteers serving as mentors.
Evaluating their effectiveness is tricky. In the writing laboratory at Bibbs, fourth graders cheerily chant a rhyme about adverbs; but they cannot name any. They enthusiastically sing a song diagramming sentences, but when asked to define a "predicate," one of the items they have just identified, the children are at a loss.
At Dixon, a simple sign suggests the complexity of the challenge: "Teach half as much, twice as well."

Chart: "A COMPARISON: School Vouchers -- The Continuing Experiment"
There are nearly 64,000 children using vouchers to attend private schools, but that number could explode this spring when as many as 60,000 students in Florida alone may become eligible. Here is a look at programs across the country, including those in Florida, Cleveland and Milwaukee, which are paid for by taxes, and the Children's Scholarship Fund, which is one of several programs sponsored by private philanthropists:
 
Florida (Opportunity Scholarship)
Student Eligibility: Students assigned to a public school whose pupils fail standardized tests twice in four years.
Participation: No limit. Participation for this school year is 53. As many as 60,000 students could be eligible next year.
Voucher Amount: Distric;s cost per student, or the private school's tuition, whichever is less. Currently about $3,400.
 
Cleveland (Pilot Project Scholarship)
Student Eligibility: Priority to families with income below double the federal poverty level. Applicants selected by lottery.
Participation: Depends on funds allocated by the Ohio State Legislature. Participation for this school year is 3,484 students.
Voucher Amount: For those below twice the poverty level, 90 percent of the private school's tuition or $2,250, whichever is less. Other families get 75 percent of tuition or $2,250, whichever is less.
 
Milwaukee (Milwaukee Parental Choice)
Student Eligibility: Income may not be more than 75 percent above the poverty level. Applicants selected by lottery.
Participation: No more than 15 percent of the Milwaukee Public Schools' enrollment. Participation for this school year is 7,996 students.
Voucher Amount: For this school year, maximum of $5,106 per pupil or private school's cost of education, whichever is less.
 
Nationwide (Children's Scholarship Fund)
Student Eligibility: Families who earn up to 170 percent more than the poverty level; for a family of four, income must be below $44,415. Average income is $21,000.
Participation: 40,000 students in 48 states, concentrated in Chicago, Detroit, New York and Los Angeles. Selected by lottery from among 1.25 million applicants.
Voucher Amount: Varies, but average is about $1,000. Families must also contribute to tuition, typically about $1,000. Fund has awarded $160 million in scholarships since 1998. (Source: Institute for the Transformation of Learning)(pg. A20)

HEADLINE: How Big a Part Of G.D.P. Are Office Pools? Make a Bet?

BYLINE: By JOBERT E. ABUEVA 

 BODY:
Don't try calling Jake Williams right now about his company's product line. Mr. Williams, a manager at Furnimex, a distributor of home textiles based in Dallas, is working furiously against a deadline of noon tomorrow to complete a special project.
Starting Monday morning, faxes began piling up on his desk, his voicemail light started blinking and messages began clogging his e-mail. As in years past, Mr. Williams is spending much of his workday confirming the orders pouring in and collecting cash from customers. 
 But not all of them are Furnimex customers. Mr. Williams organizes an office betting pool for the granddaddy event of them all: the National Collegiate Athletic Association basketball championship playoffs, a.k.a. March Madness, with 64 of the nation's top men's teams battling it out throughout the next two and a half weeks.
And here is the twist: Mr. Williams says his role as numbers man is good for business, good for workplace morale and even good for his family life since he enlists the help of his wife and son in the tabulations.
"It gets everyone excited and talking around the water cooler, regardless of their function and position in the company," Mr. Williams said. It is also a lifeline to customers old and new, he said. When his previous employer moved him from New York to Dallas 12 years ago, he said, "Everyone identified me as the sports fan, and, as many colleagues remained in New York, they wanted to know whether the tradition would be maintained."
They did not have to worry. Even though he took a job with Furnimex six years ago, the office pool he organizes around March Madness gives him a chance to renew old contacts. "It's an annual high moment that so many busy partners and friends look forward to, year in and year out," he said.
It may sound crazy, but a lot of business consultants agree with him, and many corporate bosses have long tolerated office pools on sporting events and award shows as harmless diversions. But some say the pools are much more than that because they increase camaraderie and encourage interaction in the workplace.
"The betting pool, as a shared experience, gives co-workers an excuse to see each other face to face in a world where technology has put efficiency, but distance, in our work relationships," said Bob Nelson, a consultant and author of "1001 Ways to Take Initiative at Work" (Workman, 1999).
Matt Weinstein, founder of Playfair, a management consulting firm in Berkeley, Calif., and co-author of "Work Like Your Dog" (Villard, 1999), says betting pools can make the workplace more fun -- an important consideration for retaining employees in the current job market. They can also add a light touch to otherwise humdrum activities. "Pools run the gamut from what time the U.P.S. deliveryman will arrive to how many pie charts a vice president will use during his presentation," he said.
Mr. Williams's pools have sometimes produced results that warm the hearts of even the losers. Once, a secretary who was eight months pregnant took the top prize. Another year, it was a 15-year-old high school sophomore, the son of one of Mr. Williams's customers. And once it was a top industry executive who split the money among three clerks who had entered losing sheets.
For Peter Bielby, a design engineer in Ann Arbor, Mich., betting pools are just part of the work landscape. "Pools exist everywhere I've worked -- Texas, Georgia and now back in Michigan," he said. "People look forward to it. It acts as a morale booster."
From the opening tap at the N.C.A.A. tournament's first-round game tomorrow afternoon until the April 3 championship in Indianapolis, millions of workers with a stake in the outcome will be monitoring each game, rooting for the "right" team combination. As in years past, many will crowd into office conference rooms with television sets or flip on a radio on the factory floor to catch the action.
The entry fee of $10 a sheet for Mr. Williams's pool has not changed since its inception, he said. The number of participants has grown, though, to 450 last year. That is a pot of $4,500, with the top winner getting $3,000; the first runner-up, $900, and the second, $600. This is still small potatoes compared with Wall Street pots that investment bankers say can go to five or even six figures. In all, it has been estimated that $6 billion changes hands annually in office pools around the nation, led by the Super Bowl and March Madness in dollar volume.
The volume is big enough to support a few software packages and a growing number of Web sites. The March Madness Tournament Tracker, for example, which can be downloaded from sportsdatatech.com, can track and rank up to 1,000 entries, saving organizers endless paperwork -- an efficiency that the bosses of America no doubt appreciate. Mr. Williams, though, happily remains in the Dark Ages, keeping score by hand.
In addition, Web sites like Gamesville.com and Easypool.com are for an assortment of pools. And the N.C.A.A. Web site, ncaachampionships.com, offers printouts of team seeds and pairings as well as updates.
Before the Final Four games on April 1, Mr. Williams will work out all the possibilities and advise the front-runners of their chances of winning. "This is always fun because loyalties can change in an instant, even against one's alma mater," he said. It also becomes a chance for Mr. Williams to set up appointments with Furnimex customers in the pool once the tournament ends.
So, does he face an emotional letdown when the madness is over? Not really. He and other regulars in the N.C.A.A. pool are already preparing for the draft next month for fantasy, or Rotisserie, baseball.

HEADLINE: THE POP LIFE;
Dissonance At the Pump

BYLINE: By Neil Strauss 

 BODY:
The average price of gasoline has hit yet another record high, rising for the ninth week, to $1.53 a gallon. Such inflation is hard on commuters, trucking companies and owners of sport utility vehicles. But there is another vehicle-dependent class that may be among the hardest hit in the short term: rock bands and other touring musicians. For many fledgling acts crisscrossing the country on their own dime and performing low-paying gigs in hopes of building an audience, the surge in gas prices has been crippling.
"We have a diesel truck, and in some places the gas is over $2 a gallon," said Pete Donnelly, the bassist and singer with a New York City rock group, the Figgs. "So for a band like us, where we're not making a lot of money, the gas really affects us, especially when we get out to the Midwest and West Coast and have to drive eight hours between shows. We've had to cut all our extra costs, including our road manager." 
 Bands are affected not only by the extra costs but also by concerns that gas prices will deter fans from traveling long distances to get to their shows. "I just drove to Washington, D.C., this weekend for a show, and we spent more money on gas than we did on the tickets," said Ginger Nance, a senior at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, of a recent concert by the English rock band Gomez. "I'm in college, and I don't have much money. So if it's going to cost $40 to get to a show, on top of parking and ticket costs, I'll definitely reconsider going to so many shows."
Concert promoters said they had not yet seen a noticeable dip in ticket sales. But they worry that if gas prices continue to rise, that could have a significant impact on the summer music season, when the majority of big-name concerts take place.
This is particularly worrying because they also anticipate a rise in the price of concert tickets this summer and most summer amphitheaters are an hour or so outside major cities, making gas prices an even bigger factor. The combination of steep ticket prices, service charges, inflation in fuel prices, parking costs and all the other incidentals of concertgoing (not to mention the difficulty of getting tickets to an in-demand show) could make attending a concert daunting.
Others in the industry do not expect any major fallout, said Bob Grossweiner, a concert-business analyst, because in the elastic world of popular music "the higher the price of the ticket, the faster it sells." He did note, however, that if high gas prices continued to increase bands' touring expenses, a result could be even higher ticket prices.
Particularly affected by the gas gain may be so-called jam bands like Phish and Widespread Panic, whose devoted audiences often follow them from city to city. "I think the increase in gas prices most certainly weighs heavily on the minds of anyone hitting multiple shows in a row," said Andy Gadiel, who runs the Web site Jambase.com as well as a popular Phish fan site, though he added that it would take a lot more than expensive gasoline to keep a hard-core fan from attending a show.
Seymour Guenther, a booking agent at the Nancy Fly Agency in Austin, Tex., said the gasoline hike could make a difference in the way tours are routed. "I was thinking that we may have to look at getting more money for them out there," he said of his touring acts. "The sudden rise in prices really has changed the amount of money that they bring home. We have a guy out right now who bought an old van and thought he could get around cheaply. But it's only getting 12 miles to the gallon, and it's eating his lunch."
That is Slaid Cleaves, whose rootsy album is currently topping the Americana charts. "It's just one more challenge out there," Mr. Cleaves said from a tour stop in Kentucky. "When you have to shell out $45 to $50 a night for gas, it hurts. Right now we're doing a radio show that doesn't pay any money and was a day out of our way. And maybe we wouldn't have done that if we knew gas was $1.50 a gallon."
The Memphis band Those Bastard Souls could not pay for a hotel room one night after putting $50 into the gas tank. "It's like putting a hotel room into your gas tank," said David Shouse, the band's singer.
On its current tour the group became obsessed with filling stations and prices. "We keep track of gas prices every day in the news," Mr. Shouse said. "Then we play the gas game and try to discover gas stations we've never gone to before. We bought no brand-name gas at all on this tour. But it's almost like Russian roulette, because you wonder when you're going to get a tankful of water by going the cheap route."
Todd Herfindal, the singer and guitarist with the unsigned San Francisco band Blue Sky Roadster, said there was one advantage to the soaring prices. "We just did a stint down to Las Vegas, Los Angeles and back, and it was almost $300 in gas for a big van," he said. "Our bass player put it all on his Shell card, and we're all going to pay him back. But at least he gets miles on his air fare for it, and now he's going to Puerto Vallarta in May."

HEADLINE: MANAGEMENT: The Afterlife Of a Powerful Chief;
'I'm Actually Back Doing Things,' Says One Starting Anew

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT 

DATELINE: SANTA ROSA, Calif.

 BODY:
It was about noon on a Wednesday, and the retired Silicon Valley executive in a black V-neck sweater was considering a much more relaxed range of choices than he was accustomed to: Should he start with a merlot? Or perhaps a cabernet sauvignon? And should it be a recent vintage or an older, riskier one?
Eventually, he dived in, nose first, and, after a long sniff, took a generous sip of the 1988 merlot. Pronouncing it acceptable, he moved on to the 1990, 1991 and 1994 versions. Then came the cabernets and finally a single chardonnay to wrap up the tasting. 
 After each tilt of a glass, however, came a clue that this was not a typical northern California retiree: the man swished the wine around in his mouth and then spit it into a red plastic cup. It was still before lunch, after all, and the man, Lewis E. Platt, had hours more work in front of him.
Mr. Platt, it turns out, is retired only from Silicon Valley, not from the business world. In one of the more unusual corporate job changes in years, Mr. Platt, 58, left Hewlett-Packard last year after 33 years, including an up-and-down seven-year term as chief executive, and promptly took the top job at Kendall-Jackson Wine Estates.
It was quite a transition. Since December, he has moved from Palo Alto and a global company with 124,000 employees at the center of the new economy, to Wine Country and a private firm with 1,200 workers in one of the world's oldest industries.
When Mr. Platt accepted the Kendall-Jackson job late last year rather than take the more common path of sitting on corporate boards, teaching business school classes or leading a foundation, he generated a buzz among executives around the country. Gerard R. Roche, the headhunter who selected him, said he had since received calls from at least six "big-name C.E.O.'s" asking for help in finding similar posts when they retire.
One executive said, "Get me something like that! What a way to go out," according to Mr. Roche, the chairman of the search firm Heidrick & Struggles.
Mr. Platt's new job certainly seems romantic. A wine enthusiast with a 2,500-bottle cellar at home, he works in Kendall-Jackson's headquarters here, about 60 miles north of San Francisco, with a first-floor corner office that looks out on a vineyard and the mountains that separate Napa and Sonoma Counties. He has come to the industry in good times, when the long economic expansion has inspired many Americans to drink more expensive wine. Kendall-Jackson has been one of the main beneficiaries, becoming perhaps the biggest California success story of the last decade on the strength of its $10 chardonnay.
But Mr. Platt's switch has also brought a management problem the textbooks do not discuss: how does an executive who has already climbed his way to the top, and grown used to the trappings that come with one of corporate America's plum jobs, start anew? The question is particularly relevant because both the average age and the average tenure of chief executives at large companies are dropping. As the calls to Mr. Roche indicate, even those chiefs with sterling resumes and lots of energy will be pondering what to do in the coming years.
Mr. Platt's answer has been to sublimate his ego, forget about the trappings and pretend he is 20 years younger, running a division of Hewlett-Packard. He has thrown himself into the number crunching and small decisions that he once relegated to underlings. "I'm actually back doing things," the burly, mild-mannered Mr. Platt said with satisfaction.
In his previous life, he made millions, dined with President Clinton and swapped ideas with foreign leaders at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Now, Mr. Platt says, he wants to turn his attention to one of his passions and get the satisfaction that comes from having direct responsibility for products.
In truth, he had plenty of reasons to take up fishing, one of his hobbies, after leaving Hewlett-Packard. Though the company flourished under him at first, profits slumped in his final years. Some employees and investors blamed his relaxed style, contrasting him with more aggressive corporate leaders who have remade hidebound companies. His successor, Carleton S. Fiorina, has even become the star of Hewlett-Packard's current advertising campaign, saying, "The original start-up will act like one again."
At Kendall-Jackson, Mr. Platt is at a company with a firebrand of its own. Jess Jackson, a San Francisco trial lawyer who founded the winery, and his former wife, Jane, were the only people ever to have run it, and he remains its chairman. "Jess Jackson took K. J. from a small, second-tier producer and placed it squarely among the top 10 premium producers in California," said David I. Freed, the chairman of Silverado Premium Properties, a company in Napa, Calif., that sells grapes to wineries. (Kendall is a family name of Mr. Jackson's former wife, who is no longer in management.)
Mr. Jackson has the strong entrepreneurial personality and will not have an easy time relinquishing control, say people who have worked with him. Mr. Platt, in other words, went from the undisputed head of a $50 billion company to one of two bosses at a $400 million concern.
All of which has led some industry analysts to speculate that Mr. Platt is mostly window-dressing to help Kendall-Jackson go public, a move that it has been considering for two years. Even some of his friends think his venture into the wine business is something of a lark, Mr. Platt says.
"I've had more trouble convincing my friends this is work -- they think I sit around and do tastings all day long," he said. Not so, he said: "This is a real job."
One of his first tasks has been to tinker with parts of his management style to fit his new job. Although Hewlett-Packard is a relatively flat organization where all executives work out of cubicles, Mr. Platt still relied on dozens of analysts to comb through information for him. Though he is known for his mild manners, he once stood up in front of a crowd of managers, told them they were falling down on the job, asked them for new ideas and then blasted those new ideas the next day.
At Kendall-Jackson, by contrast, he has stepped gingerly. He has told his new employees that he does not consider himself a wine industry expert simply because he is a collector. On a tour of Kendall-Jackson's storage rooms and bottling plant, for example, he met some employees for the first time and spoke to them as if he were a tourist visiting the winery, asking them about everything from the speed of a conveyer belt to the level of tannic acid in a wine. During the tasting of merlots and cabernets, he proclaimed his judgment of various vintages, but then turned to Kendall-Jackson's winemaster to see how close to the truth he was.
Only when Mr. Platt stepped into a laboratory and noticed a Hewlett-Packard chemicals machine did he try to show off some of his own knowledge. "I actually managed Hewlett-Packard's chemicals business for many years," he said, smiling, to the workers in the room.
He has brought a similar care to his relationship with Mr. Jackson. The two speak frequently, and Mr. Platt says he has been mindful of not grabbing the reins too quickly. "There are always some issues when the owner or founder is still involved," said Mr. Platt, who was Hewlett-Packard's chief when David Packard was still chairman. "You can't just storm in and take over."
Mr. Jackson said, "Lew has a selflessness about his leadership."
He also has the kind of corporate experience that almost every other professional oenophile lacks, and in a few ways he is trying to reshape Kendall-Jackson instead of himself. His laid-back approach, he hopes, will allow him to bring discipline to an enterprise that has sprouted some bureaucracy as it has grown.
When he arrived in January, Mr. Platt found an approval process for travel and other expenditures that often required five signatures for a single trip. Kendall-Jackson also had little in the way of a formal bonus plan, and employees say they received extra money largely at the whim of their bosses.
Now, all employees know their bonus depends on some combination of their year-end review, their department's performance and the company's profits. And managers receive a budget and can spend money on travel as they see fit. "As you start to give people a little more freedom," Mr. Platt said, "you can actually transfer a lot of responsibility."
(One byproduct of bureaucracy that Mr. Platt will not eliminate is the door to his office. This is the first time he has ever had one, he said.)
All the while, Mr. Platt says he has been enjoying taking more direct responsibility for the nuts-and-bolts decisions of running a company. He is studying Kendall-Jackson's vineyards to determine those that can be replanted to produce red wine, which became much more popular in the 1990's as some doctors credited moderate drinking of it with lowering the risk of heart disease. More than 70 percent of Kendall-Jackson's wine is now chardonnay.
Another priority is to sell more Kendall-Jackson wine overseas. Now, just 3 percent of its output leaves the United States.
In some ways, his current education resembles his intense introduction to wine in the 1980's. Shortly after moving to California for Hewlett-Packard, he immersed himself in the subject, buying books, attending tastings and pumping for information from his boss at the time, who was Hewlett-Packard's chief operating officer and a wine aficionado.
It was all a reaction to the first dinner parties he gave in his new state and the wine he served. "People made fun of me," he remembers, "and I didn't like that."

HEADLINE: Cohen Looks To Closer Ties With Vietnam

BYLINE: AP 

DATELINE: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam, March 14

 BODY:
Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said today that his trip to Vietnam had sown the seeds for a relationship that one day might bloom as bright as Washington's ties to many other Asian nations.
Mr. Cohen said Communist Vietnam -- the victor in a war that cost 58,000 American lives -- can look to the examples of American relations with Japan, Australia, Thailand, the Philippines and other Asia-Pacific nations that form the foundation of stability in the region. 
 "By building confidence over a period of time, hopefully one day we'll have the same kind of relationship" with Vietnam, Mr. Cohen said, while stressing that progress will necessarily be gradual and uncertain.
Mr. Cohen is the first American defense secretary to come here since the war ended in 1975.
In a policy speech at the National Defense Academy in Hanoi earlier today, Mr. Cohen said the United States is ready to "step cautiously forward" in a relationship that has grown since diplomatic ties were established in 1995.
Elaborating later in remarks to reporters flying with him to Ho Chi Minh City -- the former Saigon -- Mr. Cohen said his two days in Hanoi convinced him that Vietnamese leaders are ready to put the war behind them and move toward closer ties -- not just economically and politically but also on the military front.
"Not one individual I met with during this entire time said anything about looking back into the past," Mr. Cohen said. "They're looking to the United States in a very positive way," not as former enemy.
President Tran Duc Luong offered encouraging words to Mr. Cohen at a reception in the presidential palace.
"I think that your visit to Vietnam will be a further contribution to the development of the relationship between the two countries," the president said.
Mr. Cohen came to Hanoi to advocate a gradual approach to building a military-to-military relationship. He suggested starting with studies of the environment, removal of old land mines and improvement in Vietnam's flood control.
He said he also raised the possibility of visits by United States Navy ships to Vietnamese ports.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
European Regulators Halt Truck and Aluminum Mergers

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, March 14

 BODY:
European antitrust regulators took some of their most strenuous action against big corporate mergers today, blocking a planned $7 billion purchase by Volvo of the rival Swedish truck maker Scania and forcing three large aluminum companies to withdraw their proposed $17 billion combination.
The moves by the European Union's competition commission are not expected to slow the pace of global consolidation in the automotive and aluminum industries. But they reflected the rigorous standards set by Mario Monti, the chief European antitrust regulator, who in his six months on the job has taken a far more aggressive position than his predecessors in examining the impact of mergers on competition. 
 In rejecting a combination of Volvo and Scania announced last year, Mr. Monti said such a merger would dominate the Scandinavian market and hold a virtual monopoly for heavy trucks in Sweden.
Leif Johansson, the Volvo chief executive, said the decision appeared to "go against the basic concept of the common market."
Fears about opposition from Mr. Monti also led two aluminum companies, Alcan Aluminium of Canada and Pechiney of France to withdraw a proposal for a three-way merger with the Alusuisse Lonza Group of Switzerland. The regulators said that they would accept a combination of just Alcan and Alusuisse, but that a three-way deal including Pechiney would have to be modified.
The three companies announced in August that they intended to create the world's leading aluminum company, challenging the market leader, Alcoa of the United States.
Mr. Johansson of Volvo said his company had no plans to sell the Scania shares it now owns. Volvo holds 45.5 percent of Scania, and the proposed merger would have created the world's second-largest manufacturer of buses and trucks, after DaimlerChrysler.
Investors bid up the shares of the losers in the regulatory process, apparently in the expectation that either Volvo or Pechiney, or both, could come into play as possible takeover targets. Volvo stock rose 7 percent in Stockholm after the announcement, to 236 kronor, or $27.20, and shares of Pechiney gained more than 10 percent in Paris, closing at 57 euros, or $55.
Last year, Volvo sold its car-building division to Ford to concentrate on heavy trucks, after rejecting a bid by Fiat to buy the whole company. Recently, Volvo executives are said to have made preliminary contacts with several other rivals, including Renault of France, about a possible combination. Fiat, which on Monday announced a wide-reaching cooperation agreement with General Motors in the car business, is known to be considering whether to make an offer for Volvo.
Last August, Volvo announced its intention to take full control of Scania, forming a union of the world's No. 2 and No. 3 truck makers. To overcome regulatory objections, Volvo agreed to open its dealer network to the trucks of its competitors and to set a ceiling on its market share in the Scandinavian countries. But regulators said that even with such changes, the proposed acquisition was unacceptable because it would "significantly change the market structure to the detriment of the customers."
Since taking office, Mr. Monti, an economics professor and former dean of Bocconi University, a prestigious Italian business school, has sought to shift the emphasis in European antitrust policy from the fulfillment of legal requirements to an examination of the consequences on commercial competition. The result has been far tougher standards than were common in the past.
Since the latest European antitrust regulations were enacted in 1990, only 11 proposed mergers have been blocked, while 11 others were withdrawn in the face of probable refusal. But the proposed mergers affected today were the second and third Mr. Monti has stopped since taking up his post in September.
And the regulators are relying on support of their strict interpretation by European courts. In 1996, the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg upheld one of the first major efforts by regulators to thwart a proposed merger on the basis of its consequences for commercial markets. It blocked a combination of two big platinum-dealing companies, Lonrho of Britain and Gencor of South Africa, declaring that the merged company would be able to effectively dictate platinum prices in Europe.
Similar concerns seem to have motivated the regulators' hard line on the proposed three-way aluminum deal. Mr. Monti appeared ready to allow a merger of Alcan and Alusuisse after those companies agreed to take steps to eliminate their dominant position in the market for aluminum trihydrate, a substance used for fireproofing and film manufacturing.
But he indicated that he would block a combination of Alcan and Pechiney because of its potentially dominant position in the European market for aluminum sheets used to make containers for food, drinks and sprays.
In similar statements, Alcan and Pechiney said today that they would resubmit their proposal for a merger. The companies are under particular pressure because of Alcoa's planned $6.3 billion acquisition of Reynolds Metals, which is under investigation by antitrust authorities both in Europe and the United States.

HEADLINE: As a Conflict Intensifies, It's India's Move

BYLINE: By Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon; Daniel Benjamin is a fellow at the United States Institute of Peace in Washington. Steven Simon is assistant director of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London. Both served on the National Security Council staff from 1994 to 1999.

 BODY:
Although President Clinton's decision to visit Pakistan has received more attention, the most important hours of his Asia trip will be spent talking with India's leaders. South Asia is careening toward a crisis, and it may be that only an Indian initiative can avert disaster.
Two developments are hastening the crisis: the deteriorating relationship between India and Pakistan, and Pakistan's accelerating disintegration. Both countries have tested nuclear weapons, and last summer Pakistan-backed militants crossed into the Indian-held Kargil region of Kashmir, nearly sparking a full-fledged war. 
 In Pakistan, antipathy among ethnic groups and violence between Sunni and Shiite Muslims have been aggravated by economic decay and breathtaking misgovernment. Before he was deposed by the military last year, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif centralized power, undermining Pakistan's legislature, judiciary and provincial governments. His predecessor, Benazir Bhutto, effectively gutted public education, clearing the way for the growth of madrassahs, or Islamic schools, some of which are breeding grounds for soldiers of holy war.
These trends converge on a single spot on the map: Kashmir. The long-running conflict has changed dramatically in the last few years. The Pakistani government has sought to distract its citizens from mounting domestic problems by fostering grievances over Indian control of the region. Militant Muslims have been encouraged by the army to assert Pakistan's territorial claims and bleed Indian forces. For these zealots, Kashmir has become a holy land that they believe they must liberate.
Since 1994, the role of native Kashmiris in the insurgency has diminished as heavily armed outsiders from Pakistan and Afghanistan have stepped up the violence. Indian military observers and journalists in the area estimate that these outsiders now account for some 40 percent of the militants there and that almost two-thirds of them are recruited from madrassahs, including some schools linked to the Afghan Taliban.
Some of the outsiders are products of terrorist camps in Afghanistan. Press reports on the 1998 United States missile strike against Osama bin Laden's camps there indicated that a number of casualties were from groups active in Kashmir. In the camps, the fighters imbibe hopes of a glorious victory over India like that of the Afghans over the Soviet Union.
The Pakistani government is increasingly hard-pressed to control the radicals, who have made inroads in the army officer corps and have many sympathizers in the general populace and rich supporters in Saudi Arabia. Some militants have even declared their intent to establish a radical Islamic state in Pakistan.
Gen. Pervez Musharraf, the Pakistani leader, has voiced concerns about religious extremism. But his failure to do anything about it, along with his lack of progress toward promised economic and government reforms, indicate real limits on his authority and perhaps weakness in the army's support for him. He is in no position to make bold moves.
Thus any first step at de-escalating the Kashmir conflict must come from India. Some Indian leaders may enjoy the prospect of an enemy in turmoil, but for India and the world there can be few prospects more alarming than Pakistan's becoming the first nuclear-armed failed state.
What can President Clinton do? Washington has long offered to mediate between India and Pakistan; while Pakistan has sought intervention, India, out of cold war-era doubts about American intentions and its own great-power pride, has steadfastly declined. Yet today India's willingness to engage with the United States has increased as its economy has strengthened and as China's power has grown. Thus India might be receptive if Mr. Clinton presses the case that an internationally brokered deal on Kashmir would be in its interest.
The president's trip has led to talk in India of a new strategic partnership. India should understand that this will not develop without de-escalation in Kashmir, because the United States cannot push a desperate Pakistan further into the wilderness. But if India softens its position, that could lead to increased military cooperation and the lifting of some American technology export restrictions. If President Clinton used his visit to talk specifically about deepening American-Indian cooperation, it would help give Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee the cover he would need to overcome military and public resistance to mediation in Kashmir.
There is no guarantee that Pakistan can or will negotiate productively. But more than ever before, India has reason to come to the table.

HEADLINE: Retail Sales Remain Strong, Posting 1.1% Rise in February

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14

 BODY:
Soaring gasoline prices did little in February to deter consumers from spending money on other goods like cars, food and clothes, a government report showed today.
Retail sales rose 1.1 percent last month after rising 0.4 percent in January, the Commerce Department said. February's gain included the largest increase in the value of gas station sales in 10 months. Even when gasoline sales are excluded, sales rose 0.9 percent. 
 "For now the economy is just so strong, higher gasoline prices are just an annoyance for consumers," said Mark Vitner, an economist at the First Union Corporation in Charlotte, N.C.
Last month's sales gain was paced by a 1.4 percent increase in car and truck sales, which followed a 3 percent rise in January. Sales also rose 1.8 percent at food stores, 1.1 percent at clothing stores, 0.7 percent at furniture retailers and 0.6 percent at department stores like Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and Federated Department Stores Inc.
The General Motors Corporation posted its best February sales in a dozen years, while the Ford Motor Company and DaimlerChrysler A.G. set records for the month.
Spending "should stay strong as long as the labor market remains tight, consumer confidence remains high and the stock market is relatively stable," said Marilyn Schaja, a money market economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities in New York.
Today's report reaffirms views that the series of Federal Reserve rate increases have yet to slow consumer spending and the economy.
"This is the type of data that will encourage the Federal Reserve to raise its target at the next policy meeting," said William Sullivan, senior economist at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter in New York. The Fed's policy-making Open Market Committee will meet on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Business Travel;
A Midtown hotel divides itself up like an airplane and migrates toward business and first class.

BYLINE: By Joe Sharkey; The Business Travel column appears each Wednesday. Joe Sharkey's e-mail is jsharkey@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THE following is a typical conversation that Frank Banks says he used to have back in the early 1990's when trying to persuade a top corporate executive to stay at the Rihga Royal, the luxury hotel he runs in Midtown Manhattan:
"I always stay at the Marriott," the executive being wooed might say. 
 "Why? What's the rate you're paying over there?" Mr. Banks might ask.
"About $195 a night for a room."
"But that's the same rate we're charging here for a luxury suite."
"Yeah, but the Marriott looks better on paper to my board of directors."
Walking the quiet hallways of the Rihga Royal, nearly all of whose 500 rooms were occupied one day last week, Mr. Banks recalled those days with a shudder. The hotel was new. It was expensive, and in a then-questionable part of town for business travelers, just north of Times Square.
"This wasn't Park Avenue, after all," he said. "All I could think was, how am I going to fill 500 suites and make a profit?"
In the world of high-end corporate travel, decisions were being made by executives and boards still sensitive to the public outcry that had accompanied the horror stories of the corporate excesses of the late 1980's. It was a tough time to be going on line with a hotel meant largely to appeal to top-shelf tastes in both the corporate and the leisure trade.
"So I divided the hotel up like an airplane, with levels that corresponded to first class, business class and coach," Mr. Banks said. At first, only a single floor of the hotel's suites were in the top class.
Gradually, as the economy began booming and attitudes toward high-end corporate travel began to loosen across the board, more of the lower-priced suites were combined and redesigned for the higher level. Now, Mr. Banks said, the hotel has 100 Pinnacle Suites, which cost $625 for a one bedroom and $1,100 for two bedrooms. Other suites range up to $3,300 a night for the top-of-the-line Grand Royal Suites.
This is not the top price for a luxury hotel room in New York City, where some suites at better-known hotels can cost $9,000 a night. Instead, the Rihga Royal, which is owned by Royal Hotel Ltd., a Japanese company, is carefully positioned to appeal to the sort of corporate executives "who don't have to get two or three supervisors to approve their expenses," said Mr. Banks, who himself lives in the hotel on West 54th St.
"I say to corporate travel managers that I don't want big corporate volume. I want the two or three people in a company who are going to be able to avail themselves of our level of service. In effect, it's like selling more first-class and business-class seats," at a time when even airlines are reconfiguring planes to set aside more premium seats and take advantage of more relaxed business spending in a booming economy -- for the select few who qualify for top-dog travel.
Expense accounts from luxury hotels, of course, form only a tiny portion of the $175 billion that American companies spend a year on travel and entertainment. Most corporate travel departments -- and travelers -- are really struggling to deal with increases in costs, especially for airline travel. Yesterday, the Air Transport Association reported that with oil prices soaring, airline fuel prices are expected to rise 40 percent this year, suggesting that for air travel, "ticket prices could jump dramatically."
And mostly because of rising air fares, business travel expenses have already gone up 40 percent in recent years, even without inflation, said Kevin Mitchell, the chairman of the Business Travel Coalition, which lobbies for greater competition in the airline business and better cost controls for business travel across the board.
"We don't see the kinds of problems in the hotel industry that we have in the airlines industry," Mr. Mitchell said. "Hotels are a more classic model of a perfect market, where buyers and sellers both have really good information and there's unrestricted supply and access to the marketplace."
From the 54th floor of the Rihga Royal, looking out across a section of the city that now throbs with economic prosperity, Mr. Banks said things were looking good for businesses like his that served the well-heeled traveler willing to pay for space, convenience, service and in-room amenities like home-style comfort, plus private fax lines, personalized cell phones and video-phones.
"Over the years, we kept redesigning our suites upward to change the mix," said Mr. Banks, who ran his own hotel in Massachusetts and was a general manager of the St. Regis Hotel in New York before he took over at the Rihga in 1991, the year after it opened. "The demand for a higher lever of service keeps going up, just like on the airlines."
He thinks the high end of the market will hold its own for the foreseeable future. But there are no guarantees, of course.
"Obviously, if the economy goes south," he said, "we go south along with it."

HEADLINE: U.S. to Drop Longtime Ban On Luxuries From Iran

BYLINE: By DAVID STOUT 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14

 BODY:
When moderates triumphed in parliamentary elections in Iran last month, they probably did not anticipate that their victories would resonate in the living rooms of wealthy Americans.
But the Clinton administration, eager to encourage moderation in the land where the United States has been reviled as the Great Satan, is about to ease some import bans on Iranian consumer goods: pistachios, caviar and carpets. 
 "This opens the door for trade in both directions and does it in a way that is purely commercial, and on a purely civilian basis," said Robert Pelletreau, the chairman of the American Iranian Council, an organization founded several years ago for discussion of issues involving the United States and Iran, and a former American envoy to Egypt.
The value of the pistachios, caviar and carpets may be relatively small in terms of Iran's overall trade but it is significant for the boost it can give to private Iranian entrepreneurs by pumping much-needed hard currency into their country, administration officials said.
The move may also affect another kind of currency, less definite but no less real, in the United States: the social cachet that comes from being able to buy things that have been largely forbidden since the shah of Iran was driven from the Peacock Throne in 1979.
Whether Persian rugs are better than those from, say, India or Pakistan may be debatable, just as it is debatable whether caviar from Iranian sturgeons is better than that from Russian sturgeons. But some merchants who deal in rugs and caviar predicted tonight that imports from Iran would become fashionable almost overnight.
Iranian caviar "is going to be very trendy," predicted Silverio Benitez, a sales associate at Petrossian's restaurant-boutique on West 58th Street in New York, which sold more caviar last year than ever before, partly because people wanted to put something special on their crackers to celebrate the arrival of 2000.
Mr. Benitez declined to say exactly how much caviar Petrossian sells (Tiffany doesn't boast of its sales in diamonds, after all), but he allowed that it sells about as much as any eatery on the planet. And no wonder: Petrossian will fix up a nice caviar picnic basket for a mere $75 or so.
"In general, this is going to open up the caviar market," Mr. Benitez said. But will prices go down, and if so for how long? Will the Iranian caviar be as good as the Russian caviar that Petrossian gets from the Caspian Sea by way of Paris? And will people who like caviar be able to tell the difference?
Mr. Benitez withheld predictions on those weighty issues. But he was sure that Iranian caviar will become popular "because it's available."
Like Cuban cigars? "Exactly." Well, not exactly.
As for Persian rugs (so-called because they have been around since long before Persia became Iran in 1935), two prominent Washington-area rug businessmen predicted that they will become the rage simply because they will become available.
James Keshishian, whose family business has been selling rugs in Washington and its suburbs for 70 years, said prices of Persian rugs might go up at first, then come down as the supply grows, then go up again as Iranian exporters get shrewder in the ways of the Western marketplace.
"They may sell very well," Mr. Keshishian said. "If they look right." His voice softened as he explained how Persian rug makers sometimes wash their creations gently in tea to soften the colors and texture.
Mr. Keshishian, who has taught college courses in rug appraisal, recalled the days before the shah was toppled, when 60 percent of the rugs his business sold were Persian and 40 percent were "everything else." Since then, he said, his business has sold "70 percent everything else and 30 percent Persian," with the bulk of the Persian rugs two decades or more old.
Another Washington-area rug seller, who asked not to be identified by name for fear of offending anyone, said he sells lots of Indian and Pakistani rugs but still welcomes the lifting of the import bans. "Persians make better rugs," he said. "They've been at it a long time. We'll sell quite a few."
The lifting of the import ban is likely to be announced here on Friday at a conference of the American Iranian Council, administration officials said.
The White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said President Clinton has been looking at a variety of ways to "encourage a constructive dialogue" with Iran.
Meanwhile, the World Bank said today that it is considering loans to Iran, totaling $231 million, for the first time since 1994. So far, the United States opposes the loans, which would be used for sewerage and education. When it comes to easing world tensions, caviar and rugs go only so far.

HEADLINE: Effort to Curb Binge Drinking in College Falls Short

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN 

 BODY:
Despite a decade of aggressive prevention efforts, heavy drinking on college campuses did not diminish in the 1990's, according to a study released yesterday by the Harvard School of Public Health. But attitudes toward alcohol among students have become more polarized, with increases in abstainers and in frequent binge drinkers.
"It is disturbing that these findings show an increase in the most extreme and high-risk form of drinking," said Henry Wechsler, director of the College Alcohol Studies Program and the author of the study. "My disappointment is, given all the action on college campuses to deal with this problem, and given the attention that has been placed on it, the fact that it has stayed so remarkably stable shows what a difficult problem it is." 
 The survey of more than 14,000 students at 119 colleges in 39 states found 22.7 percent were "frequent binge drinkers," meaning they had consumed at least five drinks in a row for men, or four for women, at least three times in the two weeks before they had filled out the questionnaire. That is up from 19.8 percent in 1993, the first year of Dr. Wechsler's study, whose latest results appear in the current Journal of American College Health.
The percentage of occasional binge drinkers dropped to 21.4 last year from 24.7 in 1993, the survey found, and the percentage of non-binge drinkers -- students who had consumed alcohol in the past year but had not recently binged -- fell to 36.6 percent from 40.1 percent.
Abstainers -- students who had not drunk at all in the past year -- grew to 19.2 percent in 1999 from 15.4 percent in 1993. More students were choosing to live in alcohol-free dormitories, the survey found, and binge drinking dropped by almost 6 percent for students living on campus, while it rose a similar amount for those living off campus.
"Even at Florida State, the No. 1 party school in the nation, the majority of students do not binge drink," said Ed McGlothlin, 20, an abstainer and a junior at Florida State in Tallahassee. "But you're inundated by it. You have to go out of your way to avoid that kind of culture."
More than three-quarters of the students surveyed said they had experienced the second-hand effects of binge drinking, including being interrupted while studying or awakened (58 percent), having to take care of a drunken student (50 percent) or being insulted or humiliated (29 percent).
Dr. Wechsler examined the efforts that college administrators were making to curtail binge drinking, finding that 97 percent of the 734 institutions surveyed had alcohol education programs in place. Forty percent of the schools were working with groups in their communities to address under-age drinking, and 1 in 4 reported regular meetings on the issue with neighborhood groups.
Richard Yoast, director of a $10 million program financed by the Robert Wood Johnson foundation to address binge drinking on 10 campuses across the country, said the survey suggested that a serious commitment and coordinated efforts could have an impact on the problem. Though he was not allowed to release specific data from the 10 colleges, Dr. Yoast said the number of students who were abstaining on those campuses had almost doubled since 1993, while the rates of heavy drinkers were rising more slowly than that of the national average.
"Every campus needs to address the whole environment in which drinking occurs," Dr. Yoast said.
Mary Sue Coleman, president of the University of Iowa, one of the 10 campuses, said she had focused on the community's collective responsibility for solving the problem, with initiatives like removing alcohol from her own pre-football game brunches and urging local bar owners to buy scanners that highlight fake identification cards.
"Of course, students who drink too much must be responsible for the problems that they cause," Ms. Coleman said. "But students are not responsible for manufacturing and marketing alcoholic beverages. Students are not responsible for the excessive number of bars within walking distance of our campuses. Students are not responsible for the price specials that encourage drinking to get drunk."
Joel Wiegert, 22, a senior economics major at the University of Nebraska at Lincoln, said he had used a cost-benefit analysis to determine that he should stop binge drinking. Having accidentally broken a table, wasted untold quantities of money on beer and been rude to friends and strangers alike, Mr. Wiegert said he had "yet to come up with one benefit to high-risk drinking."

HEADLINE: Joseph Goldstein, Authority On Family Law, Is Dead at 76

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Joseph Goldstein, a longtime law professor at Yale who was widely known for his interdisciplinary approach to family law and other legal fields, died on Sunday at a hospital in New Haven. He was 76 and lived in Woodbridge, Conn.
The cause was a heart attack, the Yale Law School's director of public affairs, Elizabeth Stauderman, said. 
 Dr. Goldstein, who was also a psychoanalyst, was a co-author of three books that, as Martin Guggenheim, a professor of law at New York University, put it, became "required reading for judges and practitioners in the field of child custody and other legal issues relating to judicial decisions concerning a child's future."
The books are "Beyond the Best Interests of the Child" (1973), "Before the Best Interests of the Child" (1979) and "In the Best Interests of the Child" (1986). Dr. Goldstein wrote them with Anna Freud, the psychoanalyst and daughter of Sigmund Freud, and Albert J. Solnit, the director of the Yale Child Study Center. The 1986 book was also written with Dr. Goldstein's wife, Sonja.
Dr. Goldstein joined the law school's faculty in 1956 and retired in 1993. Then he became a professorial lecturer at the law school, and held that post at his death.
Alan M. Dershowitz, the Felix Frankfurter Professor of Law at Harvard Law School and a former student of Dr. Goldstein's, said Dr. Goldstein "introduced, probably more than anyone else, real interdisciplinary thinking in the law school and thus the legal world in general." His influence was widely felt, Professor Dershowitz said, through both his writing and his influential students.
Central to Dr. Goldstein's and his co-authors' thinking, Dr. Guggenheim said, was the idea "that courts should choose the alternative that was the least detrimental to the interest of the child."
That principle, in the authors' view, followed from an even more basic one: They were highly distrustful of the capacity of judges to make intelligent decisions about custody arrangements. And so, Dr. Guggenheim said, "they wanted courts to have very limited authority to intervene in a family."
The books also expressed the view that custody disputes should be looked at from the point of view of children, especially their perspective on time. For example, for very young children, six months might be 100 percent of their life, not six months in the life a 40-year-old.
In the foster-care side of family law, Dr. Guggenheim said, Dr. Goldstein's and his co-authors' views encouraged the acceleration of termination of parents rights in cases where children were in foster care.
"As a result of their work," Dr. Guggenheim said, "statutes were rewritten to shorten the length of time children should be in foster care before courts would terminate the right of the natural parents, freeing the children to become eligible to be adopted."
Dr. Goldstein's work involving family law, Professor Dershowitz said, was an application of his thinking about the interface between psychiatry and the law. Early in his career he began studying issues related to the insanity defense.
Dr. Goldstein went on to write "The Family and the Law" (1965) with Jay Katz, a Yale Law School professor and psychiatrist, and "Psychoanalysis, Psychiatry and the Law" (1966) with Professors Katz and Dershowitz. He finished his own psychoanalytic training in 1968 at the Western New England Psychoanalytic Institute.
"He changed both law and psychoanalysis" by bringing them together, Professor Dershowitz said. "In the world of law, he made us all think about the role of law as superego, how we internalize law, how we make it part of our personality. And then, I think, he used the concept of law to help broaden and make more meaningful concepts like the superego and psychoanalysis."
Joseph Goldstein was born in Springfield, Mass. He received a bachelor's degree from Dartmouth, a doctorate from the London School of Economics and a law degree from Yale. He was a law clerk for Judge David L. Bazelon of the United States Court of Appeals in Washington and taught briefly at Stanford Law School before returning to Yale as an associate professor of law.
He also was an author, co-author or editor of books on criminal law, on the My Lai massacre and on constitutional law.
He was an Army code-breaker in World War II.
Dr. Goldstein is survived by his wife and co-author, the former Sonja Lambek; three sons, Joshua, of Cambridge, Mass., Jeremiah, of Philadelphia, and Daniel, of Davis, Calif.; a daughter, Anne Goldstein of Hartford, Conn.; eight grandchildren; a brother, E. Ernest Goldstein, who lives in Texas, and a sister, Mariam Sommer of New Haven.

HEADLINE: Teacher Hiring Rule Relaxed, Opening Quick Jobs for Those Licensed Elsewhere

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT 

 BODY:
In a move to address a looming teacher shortage in New York City and across the state, education officials have decided to allow credentialed teachers from most other states to begin teaching here immediately rather than waiting until they pass New York's certification exams.
The state's Board of Regents quietly approved an emergency amendment to state education regulations March 7 giving the Education Department the ability to grant a two-year provisional certification to licensed teachers who move to New York from one of 39 other states or to those who have a national teaching certificate. 
 The measure was introduced to the Regents by Richard P. Mills, the education commissioner, at the request of Harold O. Levy, New York City's interim schools chancellor, who resigned from the Board of Regents earlier this year when he took charge of the city's school system.
New York City is facing a potentially crippling teacher shortage. A recent survey of its members by the United Federation of Teachers found that an estimated 14,000 of New York City's 78,000 public school teachers planed to retire over the next 18 months, a far faster pace than previously predicted. The Board of Education has said it expects its overall hiring needs, stemming from retirements, other turnover and the creation of new classes, to more than double for the 2001-2002 school year, to 19,000 new teachers.
"This is a deliberate response to New York City's need" for new teachers, Mr. Mills said of the new measure.
"This is an extraordinary moment, and it is in the widespread public interest for us to recruit more teachers," he added.
About 1,500 teachers from other states apply for certification in New York each year, a figure that Mr. Mills predicted could easily double under the new standard. "If we recruited hard and had some money behind that effort, we could be even more effective," he said.
Teachers hired under the new provision will have two years to complete the appropriate New York certification exams, which are administered quarterly. Until now, teachers from other states might have been discouraged from applying here, finding more lenient policies elsewhere, education officials said.
Although New York City has hired significant numbers of uncertified teachers in recent years, the new policy is expected to expand the number of applicants from other states because the city's Board of Education will give preference to candidates with certification, even from other states, over uncertified teachers.
Currently, about 10,000 New York City teachers, more than 10 percent of the total, are unlicensed. But state law will forbid the hiring of unlicensed teachers beginning in 2003. Moreover, the Education Department has proposed shortening the time it allows unlicensed teachers to work in a classroom before fulfilling their license requirements.
Gov. George E. Pataki and Joseph L. Bruno, the majority leader of the State Senate, have proposed teacher recruitment packages that include salary bonuses, scholarships and other financial incentives. Teacher recruitment has also emerged as a central education issue in the Senate campaigns of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton.
The federal government also is making efforts to lure college students into teaching. Yesterday, the Department of Housing and Urban Development announced a plan to enable teachers to buy, at half price, homes owned by the department in economically distressed neighborhoods.
Previous efforts to allow out-of-state teachers to gain immediate teaching rights in New York have been opposed by politicians and education officials who first wanted other states to recognize New York's credentials, Mr. Levy said yesterday. But believing that the teacher shortage has become too dire to allow that requirement to remain, Mr. Levy asked Mr. Mills to take the new measure before the Regents.
"I don't want reciprocity," Mr. Levy said yesterday. "I want it very much one way. I want to take their teachers and make them unable to take our teachers."
The leader of New York City's teachers union cautioned that the new measure would not help New York City unless it raised the pay of its teachers to match the salaries of teachers in suburban areas.
"It might help open up the supply a bit, but it's a baby step," said Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers. "If their credentials are recognized and they can earn 20 percent more in the suburbs, it might very well push more people to the suburbs."
Mr. Levy has made teacher recruitment a focus of his tenure as interim chancellor. He and Mr. Mills recently met with the deans of 12 schools of education in New York State to discuss ways to draw more liberal arts students to a career in teaching.
This spring, the board is testing an online system known as Resumex, which allows prospective teachers from around the country to transmit resumes electronically to the board, creating a database that can be used by districts and schools for hiring.
New York City hires about 8,000 new teachers each year. The shortage could worsen starting July 2001 because of a salary provision in the teachers' contract that is expected to encourage retirements. The Board of Education anticipates needing 19,000 new teachers for the school year that begins in September 2001. Over the next five years, the United Federation of Teachers has said, the school system will need 54,000 new teachers.
The new measure to broaden hiring from out-of-state is restricted to teachers who are licensed by states and territories that have signed an interstate agreement that defines some of the qualifications that are necessary to obtain a teaching license. Forty states plus the District of Columbia, Guam and Puerto Rico are parties to the agreement. The 10 states that are not part of the interstate agreement are Alaska, Iowa, Kansas, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Dakota, Wisconsin and Wyoming.
Alternatively, teachers who are licensed in any state and also have a certificate from the National Board of Professional Teaching Standards will be eligible for the New York program.

HEADLINE: School Vouchers Are Ruled Unconstitutional in Florida

BYLINE: By JODI WILGOREN 

 BODY:
A Florida judge ruled yesterday that the state's Constitution barred students from using taxpayer money for private school tuition, blocking Florida's eight-month-old voucher program, the nation's boldest experiment in using market forces to improve failing schools.
The decision, which the state says it will appeal, is the second major legal setback for voucher proponents in recent months, following a federal judge's ruling that Cleveland's program contravenes the First Amendment's separation of church and state. 
 Florida's is the first statewide voucher program and the first anywhere to tie voucher eligibility to schools' performance on standardized tests. It serves as a model for a national voucher plan proposed by Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the expected Republican presidential nominee, and has been copied by several of the 25 state legislatures now considering new voucher initiatives.
"This ruling puts a stake in the heart of the voucher movement," said Bob Chase, president of the National Education Association, the teachers' union whose Florida affiliate was involved with the lawsuit challenging vouchers. "It sends a strong signal to states across the nation that vouchers are no substitute for a quality public education."
Under the ruling, the 53 children in Pensacola, Fla., who are now using vouchers to attend private schools will be allowed to finish out the semester, but the state will not pay their tuition next year. The ruling also stops the program's expansion to as many as 60,000 students in 78 schools who would have become eligible for vouchers in June if their schools were graded "F" for the second time in four years.
"It's a tragedy because this beacon of hope that has been offered to parents as a way for their children to get a better education has, at least temporarily, been snuffed out," said John F. Kirtley, a Tampa venture capitalist who is on the board of Floridians for School Choice, a pro-voucher group.
Mr. Kirtley and Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida, the architect of the program, vowed to raise private donations to allow the Pensacola students using the vouchers to stay in the private schools, where their parents say they are thriving.
"This is about children -- it's not about the system, it's not about adults," Mr. Bush, the brother of the presidential candidate, said in an afternoon news conference at the Statehouse in Tallahassee. "I'm personally not going to let parents who have been given the assurance that their children can go to another school -- I'm not going to force them back to schools they don't want to go to."
The ruling by Judge L. Ralph Smith Jr. of the Circuit Court of Florida focuses on a provision of the Florida Constitution that declares education a "fundamental value" of the state and says it is a "paramount duty" to provide a "uniform, efficient, safe, secure and high quality system of free public schools."
The constitutional obligation to provide education, in Article IX, Section I, has existed for more than a century, but the specifics about how it should be provided were added by voters in November 1998 -- the same year Mr. Bush was elected governor on a platform that emphasized school accountability and school choice.
In defending against the lawsuit filed by groups of parents and teachers, voucher proponents argued that since the state already spent millions of dollars a year sending disabled and other students with special needs to private schools, it could also do so to help students escape low-performing schools.
But Judge Smith said that because the voucher program used private schools to provide the same services offered by public ones, it "supplants the system of free public schools mandated by the constitution."
While the ruling may be a catastrophic blow to Florida's program, its impact nationally is limited, since it turns on a narrow provision of the State Constitution. Virtually every state constitution has such a provision outlining the state's responsibility to provide public education, but judges in each state may interpret the language differently.
The broader question is whether vouchers, which are typically used at parochial schools, violate the federal Constitution's separation of church and state. Cleveland's voucher program, involving about 3,500 students, was declared illegal on those grounds in December, a decision that has been appealed and is expected to come before the United States Supreme Court soon.
Yesterday's ruling is likely to be appealed directly to the State Supreme Court in Florida.
"This is a blip in the voucher movement," said Clint Bolick, a lawyer for the Institute for Justice, a conservative group based in Washington that helped defend the lawsuit. "There has not been a single lawsuit yet where we have not had at least a momentary setback. We have developed some serious stamina. At the end of the day, we have not lost a single voucher program."
Vouchers were first proposed by the economist Milton Friedman in 1955 and are one of the most contentious issues in education and political circles today, a crucial point of disagreement between the likely Democratic and Republican presidential nominees. More than 25 state legislatures have voucher bills pending, and many major cities, including New York, are wrestling with the question of whether vouchers are a threat to the public school system or its savior.
The Florida decision is the latest in a string of legal victories for voucher opponents, a coalition of teachers' unions and civil liberties groups that have won court challenges against small programs in Maine, Pennsylvania and Vermont as well as Ohio. Milwaukee's voucher program, the nation's oldest and largest, with 8,000 low-income students enrolled this year, has been upheld by Wisconsin's highest court.
"The future will really very much be determined by what the U.S. Supreme Court does when it gets the question," said Joseph P. Viteritti, a professor at New York University who has written a book on school choice. "If the court says it's against the Constitution, these things can't really move. On the other hand, if the court did approve it, it doesn't necessarily mean you're going to have 50 states with voucher laws, either. The politics of many states are not friendly to vouchers."
Though Florida's was the first statewide voucher program and was likely to have become the nation's largest when school grades are released in June, it was confined this year to two schools in the most impoverished neighborhoods of Pensacola because they were the only ones with failing scores on standardized tests two consecutive years.
Tom Gallagher, the state's education commissioner, said he would continue to grade schools as planned this spring, and that students in schools with repeated F's would still be allowed to transfer to public schools with grades of C or higher.
 
What the Florida Constitution Says
Following is Article IX, Section 1 of the Florida Constitution on public education, which was cited as the reason for a judge's decision yesterday that the state's school voucher program is illegal. The provision has been on the books for more than a century although it was amended in 1998.
The education of children is a fundamental value of the people of the State of Florida. It is, therefore, a paramount duty of the state to make adequate provision for the education of all children residing within its borders. Adequate provision shall be made by law for a uniform, efficient, safe, secure and high quality system of free public schools that allows students to obtain a high quality education and for the establishment, maintenance and operation of institutions of higher learning and other public education programs that the needs of the people may require.

In the Midst of Upheaval, Yet Out of Public Sight: Horst Kohler

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, March 14

 BODY:
Horst Kohler, the veteran German banker now expected to run the International Monetary Fund, is not widely known, even in Germany. But he is no stranger to the kinds of seismic political and economic upheaval that come with the responsibility of managing a global lender to financially distressed nations.
Mr. Kohler was a financial engineer behind two of Europe's biggest transformations. The first was the reunification of Germany 10 years ago after the collapse of Communism. The second occurred relatively recently: the creation of the euro, the common currency that 11 European nations adopted more than a year ago. 
 People who know Mr. Kohler say that far from being a political or economic lightweight, as detractors have suggested, he has the toughness of someone who has endured baptisms by fire.
Perhaps more surprising, he could prove to be a tough-minded fiscal conservative in the political battle over the I.M.F.'s future mission and strategy.
Many of Mr. Kohler's mentors and longtime colleagues are top officials at the German central bank, people who have for years argued that the monetary fund should avoid big bailouts.
In that regard, Mr. Kohler may well echo those in Congress and the Clinton administration who want to curtail some of the lending institution's activity.
"He is a conservative -- by his background, his party affiliation and the jobs he has held," said Norbert Walter, chief economist at Deutsche Bank. "He is a hard-liner."
After two weeks of trans-Atlantic bickering, the United States reluctantly endorsed Mr. Kohler on Monday to become the next managing director of the I.M.F.
Washington's accession, following agreement by all 15 European Union countries, ended a spectacle stemming in large part from Germany's insistence that the job go to a German for the first time in the I.M.F.'s 37-year history. A week earlier, President Clinton defied the Germans' wishes by rejecting their first choice for the job, Deputy Finance Minister Caio Koch-Weser.
Mr. Kohler, who was on the way to I.M.F. headquarters in Washington today, declined to be interviewed. But he picked up more endorsements: from Russia and Japan, and from his prospective counterpart at the World Bank, James D. Wolfensohn, who said that the German would be "a very, very good person to run the I.M.F."
To most people, Mr. Kohler is an unknown quantity. Born on Feb. 22, 1943, in Skierbieszow, Poland, he is married with two children. He has spent most of his career in banking and finance -- for the last two years as president of the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which lends money to projects in the former Soviet republics and Eastern Europe.
Despite his professional achievements, Mr. Kohler has worked largely outside public view. That could be one of his biggest problems.
American officials vetoed Mr. Koch-Weser partly on the grounds that, in their view, he lacked sufficient international stature to run the I.M.F., which provides emergency financing to developing and distressed countries.
But Mr. Kohler is hardly a neophyte. Now 57, he was a top economic adviser to Chancellor Helmut Kohl a decade ago, as the Berlin Wall was crumbling. Without warning, he found himself in the midst of changes of extraordinary sorts.
As Mr. Kohl's representative to the Group of Seven industrial nations, he led negotiations over the restructuring of billions of dollars worth of debt left by the collapsed Soviet Union.
Because Germany was and remains one of Russia's biggest sources of foreign lending, Mr. Kohler frequently sparred with the United States over how countries would divide the burden of refinancing or writing off old loans.
Mr. Kohler was also the financial architect of a far-reaching deal with Russia to evacuate its troops from the former East Germany. Under that deal, the Germans agreed to finance an enormous building program in Russia, which would provide homes for soldiers as well as a source of jobs.
One of his important legacies was his work in bringing about the economic unification of eastern Germany with the western areas.
He provided the blueprint for Germany's currency conversion in 1990, under which the former East Germans received one West German mark for every two of the nearly worthless Ostmarks.
The plan was harshly criticized by some economists and led to the resignation of Karl Otto Pohl as president of Germany's central bank. But Chancellor Kohl barreled over all objections on the ground that the political reality of German unification would allow nothing less.
Germany is still groaning under the consequences. Eastern unemployment remains nearly 20 percent, twice as high in the West, partly because prices and wages have soared to western levels without a comparable rise in productivity.
Mr. Kohler also played a big role in organizing the enormously expensive privatization of state businesses in the eastern areas. As a top official in the finance ministry, he organized the Treuhand, the agency charged with selling 11,000 rusting and moribund companies.
The Treuhand soon gained a reputation for catering to western German bargain hunters. It supplied tens of billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies to industrial companies that either collapsed or eliminated most of their workers.
Many experts argue that the privatizations would have been messy under any circumstances, and the experience in some other former Communist countries was worse.
Even as Germany was coming to grips with reunification, Mr. Kohler was negotiating over plans for a common European currency. His job was to take the vaguely defined vision of a single currency and ensure that Germany's unflinching emphasis on price stability was dominant in all policy-making.
That meant forcing countries like France to accept German demands for fiscal austerity as well as an independent central bank.
"If you look at the structure of the European Central Bank, it is not far from the structure of the German Bundesbank," said Gert Haller, who worked closely with Mr. Kohler and succeeded him as top adviser to Chancellor Kohl."If we hadn't succeeded in making the central bank the way it is now, the whole thing could not have been sold in Germany."

After Injury, Added Insult Of Late Aid

BYLINE: By MATTHEW PURDY 

DATELINE: NEW LONDON, Conn.

 BODY:
THE horror began last Mother's Day. Sean Tobin, a young hospital corpsman at the Navy submarine base in Groton, told the police that he grew so frustrated with his 6-week-old son, who was crying and refusing a bottle, that he shook him until his "neck appeared very loose and his head was rolling around." Then he slammed the baby on the couch.
Doctors said the baby was unlikely to survive, and the family removed life supports. But the baby, Vincent Tobin, lived. Nearing his first birthday, he is almost totally blind, severely hearing-impaired and unable to crawl or sit up on his own. Cerebral palsy has been diagnosed. 
 The criminal case moved efficiently. Mr. Tobin, 20, pleaded guilty to assault. At an emotional hearing in Superior Court here earlier this month, a judge sentenced him to 18 years in state prison.
The disposition for Vincent Tobin has been anything but efficient. Born a healthy son of a Navy man, he is now the medically needy son of a convict. Along the way, he lost one thing he desperately needed, health insurance. A case that began with one man's rage became a parable for the chronic frustration of navigating the health insurance system.
At 19, Tina Riggio, Vincent's mother, was suddenly the unemployed mother of a baby who needed her constant attention as well as specialized medical care. She moved in with her parents near Orlando, Fla., and took her son to pediatricians, neurologists and eye doctors. He began physical and speech and occupational therapy five days a week.
"He will eventually be in a wheelchair," Ms. Riggio said. "If he doesn't learn to use his hands, he will have a feeding tube. He will never walk. He will never talk. He will actually get very stiff."
Then came the bills, many with notations like, "For us to continue providing medical services, you must pay outstanding balance immediately."
The Navy has a program to assist dependents of military personnel who leave the service due to domestic abuse, which is paying Ms. Riggio $1,078 a month for three years. The money helps, since she cannot both work and care for Vincent. (She worked at a Pizza Hut before he was injured.) But it doesn't begin to cover Vincent's medical care. Ms. Riggio applied many months ago for health insurance under the same program, and waited for the Navy to respond, with unpaid bills approaching $5,000 as of Monday.
Peggy Stellabotte, an administrative assistant at the Easter Seals clinic in Deltona, Fla., where Vincent received therapy, said Tricare, the military medical plan, returned his bills, saying without explanation that he was not covered. Medicaid, for which Ms. Riggio and Vincent qualified, also refused, saying Tricare was the primary insurer.
Ms. Stellabotte said that Easter Seals often treated uninsured children but that Ms. Riggio stopped taking her son for $55-a-day sessions in December, fearing it would only add to the stack of unpaid bills.
Ms. Riggio arrived at her husband's sentencing carrying their dark-haired, olive-skinned baby and a sheaf of his bills. But the hearing concerned the crime, not the aftermath.
Vincent Riggio, the baby's maternal grandfather and namesake, told the judge: "He has no idea who I am. He has no idea who my wife is." Mr. Tobin, he said, "destroyed my grandson."
MR. TOBIN'S mother, Renee, said, "My son's not a bad man, he's a good boy." She told the judge that "I am the product of physical abuse, sexual abuse, verbal abuse," and said that "as parents we don't recognize what we teach our children until it is too late."
Vincent, cradled in his mother's lap, let loose with a cry. Then his father was taken away to prison.
There he will have a full range of medical, mental health and dental services. For prisoners, at least, medical care is a right.
For Vincent, it was far more complicated. "I can really assure you that the Navy is working with this family to help them get any benefits, medical or monetary, that they are entitled to," was all Lt. Sandra Johnson, assistant legal counsel for Navy Personnel Command, would say about Vincent on Friday after several calls to the Navy.
That was news to Ms. Riggio, who felt alone against the Navy. Then, yesterday afternoon, a Navy official called Ms. Riggio to say she and Vincent would receive Tricare. "These things take some time," said Lt. Ingrid Mueller, a Navy spokeswoman.
In Vincent's case, it took nine months, or about three-quarters of his life.

Gasoline Tax Follies

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN 

 BODY:
Teachers of economics cherish bad policies. For example, if New York ever ends rent control, we will lose a prime example of what happens when you try to defy the law of supply and demand. And so we should always be thankful when an important politician makes a really bad policy proposal.
Last week George W. Bush graciously obliged, by advocating a reduction in gasoline taxes to offset the current spike in prices. This proposal is a perfect illustration of why we need economic analysis to figure out the true "incidence" of taxes: the people who really pay for a tax increase, or benefit from a tax cut, are often not those who ostensibly fork over the cash. In this case, cutting gasoline taxes would do little if anything to reduce the price motorists pay at the pump. It would, however, provide a windfall both to U.S. oil refiners and to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. 
 Let's start with why the oil cartel should love this proposal. Put yourself in the position of an OPEC minister: What sets the limits to how high you want to push oil prices? The answer is that you are afraid that too high a price will lead people to use less gasoline, heating oil and so on, cutting into your exports. Suppose, however, that you can count on the U.S. government to reduce gasoline taxes whenever the price of crude oil rises. Then Americans are less likely to reduce their oil consumption if you conspire to drive prices up -- which makes such a conspiracy a considerably more attractive proposition.
Anyway, in the short run -- and what we have right now is a short-run gasoline shortage -- cutting gas taxes probably won't even temporarily reduce prices at the pump. The quantity of oil available for U.S. consumption over the near future is pretty much a fixed number: the inventories on hand plus the supplies already en route from the Middle East. Even if OPEC increases its output next month, supplies are likely to be limited for a couple more months. The rising price of gasoline to consumers is in effect the market's way of rationing that limited supply of oil.
Now suppose that we were to cut gasoline taxes. If the price of gas at the pump were to fall, motorists would buy more gas. But there isn't any more gas, so the price at the pump, inclusive of the lowered tax, would quickly be bid right back up to the pre-tax-cut level. And that means that any cut in taxes would show up not in a lower price at the pump, but in a higher price paid to distributors. In other words, the benefits of the tax cut would flow not to consumers but to other parties, mainly the domestic oil refining industry. (As the textbooks will tell you, reducing the tax rate on an inelastically supplied good benefits the sellers, not the buyers.)
A cynic might suggest that that is the point. But I'd rather think that Mr. Bush isn't deliberately trying to throw his friends in the oil industry a few extra billions; I prefer to believe that the candidate, or whichever adviser decided to make gasoline taxes an issue, was playing a political rather than a financial game.
There still remains the argument that the only good tax is a dead tax. This leads us into the whole question of whether those huge federal surplus projections are realistic (they aren't), whether the budget is loaded with fat (it isn't), and so on. But anyway, the gasoline tax is dedicated revenue, used for maintaining and improving the nation's highways. This is one case in which a tax cut would lead directly to cutbacks in a necessary and popular government service.
You could say that I am making too much of a mere political gambit. Gasoline prices have increased more than 50 cents per gallon over the past year; Mr. Bush only proposes rolling back 1993's 4.3-cent tax increase.
But the gas tax proposal is nonetheless revealing. Mr. Bush numbers some of the world's leading experts on tax incidence among his advisers. I cannot believe that they think cutting gasoline taxes is a good economic policy in the face of an OPEC power play. So this suggests a certain degree of cynical political opportunism. (I'm shocked, shocked!) And it also illustrates the candidate's attachment to a sort of knee-jerk conservatism, according to which tax cuts are the answer to every problem.
As a citizen, then, I deplore this proposal. As a college lecturer, however, I am delighted.

An Allegiance to Public Schools

BYLINE: By Richard Rothstein; E-mail: rrothstein@nytimes.com

 BODY:
BETWEEN a booming economy and reports of growing disillusion with public schools, you'd expect private school enrollment to soar. Yet the proportion of students in private schools has been falling nationwide.
Certainly, it's easy to get the idea that more parents now choose private schools. Advocates of tax-financed private education often suggest that vouchers are inevitable, because more parents now "vote with their feet" to abandon public schools. Even some public education supporters believe there has been a shift to private schooling, and that belief is unlikely to be shaken by a Florida judge's ruling against the state voucher program yesterday. 
 Recently, Gov. Gray Davis of California proposed scholarships for public school students who perform well, a program critics contend would mostly aid the well-off. Not true, Mr. Davis said, because nowadays few affluent students attend public schools.
The reality is otherwise. Only about 15 percent of children from the highest-earning fifth of families were at private schools in 1997, down slightly from 1979. At the other end, few poor children (those from the lowest-earning fifth of families) ever attended private schools; this percentage has also dropped. As for children from the middle three-fifths, the private school share has fallen for them, too.
We hear a lot about charter schools, but their enrollment is still less than 1 percent of American students. Home schooling is apparently growing, but numbers are small. In contrast, polls show Americans praise the mostly traditional, mostly suburban public schools their children attend. Only when surveys ask about schools generally does satisfaction fall, perhaps because impressions don't come from direct experience.
The decline in private school percentages partly results from fewer parochial students as Roman Catholic families have moved from urban ethnic enclaves to suburbs. But even expensive independent schools enroll surprisingly few students. About 4 percent of children from high-income families are in nonreligious private schools, up only a fraction from 1979.
A mistaken impression of gains by private schools may stem from accounts of a small but opinion-shaping group of affluent parents, living in areas like Manhattan. They do choose private education, unlike most in the middle class who seek better public schools by moving to suburbs.
But in truth, few parents can really discern "good" schools that help students stretch their potential. Realtors point to test scores and college admission rates, but students from literate families test well even if a school's instruction adds little to how they would perform in any setting. A school's socioeconomic makeup can predict average test scores with startling accuracy. Some suburban schools are unusually effective, but it is hard to tell which ones.
Still, moving to a suburb with high test scores is rational, because peers are important. Children tend to excel more when surrounded by others whose families expect academic success. Where most children lack this support, performance can lag even with the best instruction.
Middle-class movement to suburbs with "better" schools is accelerating. Across the nation, more workers with city jobs now commute from suburbs, where they send their children to public schools.
An exception is a growing class of college-educated couples living in central cities. Some may willingly trade access to suburban public schools for the growing amenities of city living.
Yet their urban neighborhood schools enroll many relatively low-scoring poor children. Teachers may be effective, but they are preoccupied with coaching basic skills that middle-class children take for granted. There is less peer pressure to aim for admission to Ivy League universities. So affluent parents conclude that these schools are inadequate, and try for private placements.
Many who now choose urban lifestyles attended suburban public schools when they were young. Their new neighborhood schools, filled with low achievers, are unlike those they recall from childhood, so these city dwellers easily conclude that public schools used to be better. But the quality of middle-class suburban schools has not declined. What's new is the presence of affluent families in poor people's neighborhoods.
These high-income urban parents face a dilemma. Should they send their children to neighborhood public schools that lack peer influences to raise achievement, or seek private schools filled with students whose families are like theirs? However they resolve this, their quandary should not obscure the continuing allegiance of most middle-class families to suburban public education.
If Americans now "vote with their feet," they typically do so by moving toward public schools, not away from them.

HEADLINE: Neighbors of A-Plant Lash Out at Con Ed

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

DATELINE: PEEKSKILL, N.Y., March 14

 BODY:
At a sometimes clamorous public meeting tonight two miles from the dormant Indian Point 2 nuclear power plant, dozens of people from nearby communities railed against Consolidated Edison and federal officials for failing to prevent a brief radioactive leak that shut the plant down a month ago and sparked a regional radiation alert.
No measurable radiation was released, but the incident, on Feb. 15, was the most serious in the plant's 26-year history. 
 The meeting was convened by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, which licenses and inspects nuclear plants, to provide the first detailed summary of an investigation of the incident to the people living around the plant.
Randy Blough, the agency's director of reactor projects for the northeast region, which includes New York, said that "there were some equipment and procedures problems" as the leak was detected and the plant was shut down. Mr. Blough said that this finding would result in some recommendations by the agency. But, he added, "Our overall assessment is that Con Ed handled the event successfully."
Many people in the audience of about 100 were not assuaged by the agency's hourlong presentation. Andrew Courtney, who lives in Croton, five miles south of the plant, said the agency was acting as an apologist for the utility. Con Ed had officials in the audience, but none addressed the crowd.
"The N.R.C. tonight is whitewashing what happened," Mr. Courtney said.
Several members of the audience said that the commission long ago should have ordered Con Ed to do what every other owner of a similar nuclear plant -- including the state-owned plant right next door, Indian Point 3 -- had done years earlier: replace the aging steam generators that transfer the energy from splitting atoms to turbines that produce electricity.
Steam generators, dense nests of thin-walled metal tubes holding radioactive water, have long been considered one of the weakest links in the intricate chain of equipment inside a nuclear plant.
At the meeting, engineers with the commission explained that they can only order the plant to stay shut until conditions meet regulations; they cannot make a specific order to replace equipment like a steam generator. "That is ultimately an economic decision of the owner," said Hubert Miller, the regional administrator for the nuclear commission.
During the presentation, the officials said that all operations and measurements of radiation or leaks at the plant were well within federal guidelines, even in the days leading up to the radioactive leak.
Con Ed officials have said that they knew for several weeks before the shutdown that one of the four steam generators inside Indian Point 2 had a rising rate of leaks, which allowed radioactive water to contaminate the water being heated to create steam. This faulty generator later sprang a much larger leak, which precipitated the alert on Feb. 15.
Inspectors from the federal nuclear agency, who are stationed full time at the plant, were aware of the earlier leakage but did not call for the plant to be shut down for tests.
The revelation that Con Ed was aware of the earlier minor leaks has inflamed many elected officials from Westchester County and other areas near the plant.
Also angering local residents and politicians is Con Ed's resistance thus far to calls from private groups tracking nuclear safety to install replacements for the aging steam generators.
Con Ed officials said today that the company would decide what to do once investigations at the plant were complete.
Until now, the company has told shareholders and the public that the existing units were so closely monitored and inspected that a serious accident was very unlikely and that the units could be used for years to come.
Since the incident, Con Ed and the federal and state agencies that oversee the nuclear plant have been facing a drumbeat of criticism over the leak, the events leading up to it, and Con Ed's plans to pass along to its customers the costs related to the shutdown.
On Monday, Andrew J. Spano, the Westchester County executive, asked the county legislature to approve a lawsuit against the state's Public Service Commission, demanding that the agency prevent Con Ed from passing along to customers the $600,000-a-day cost of buying electricity to make up for the loss of power while Indian Point 2 sits idle.
The suit, if approved by the Legislature, would contend that the utility was negligent and should absorb any costs and not pass them on through rate increases. The Legislature could consider the measure as soon as March 27, county officials said.
Today, Susan Tolchin, a spokeswoman for Mr. Spano, said: "Not only are we faced with the onus of the leak, adding insult to injury, we're having to pay for their mistake."

HEADLINE: From Minks to Mules, U.S. Issues China Trade Details

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14

 BODY:
Mink skins, with or without head, tail or paws. Diesel locomotives. Pure-bred asses and mules.
Those are turn-of-the-millennium equivalents of throw-weights and hard-target killers, the stuff of diplomatic progress between superpowers. These days, when the United States and China take confidence-building measures, they deal in capers, not submarine-based missiles. 
 The Clinton administration, responding to Congressional pressure, today declassified and released a 250-page document, "Agreement on Market Access Between the People's Republic of China and the United States of America." Both sides have hailed the agreement, signed in November, as their greatest diplomatic breakthrough since they renewed economic ties in 1979.
The accord helps redefine relations between the most powerful country and the most populous. But it does so without much diplomatic wordplay or soaring verbiage. In fact, there are no more than a handful of passages that include full English sentences. It is less a treaty than a spreadsheet.
"I don't think the United States has ever negotiated a trade agreement with this kind of specificity," said Ira Wolf, a senior trade adviser to Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, and certainly one of the few people outside the United States Trade Representative's office to have perused the eye-straining small print.
Until today, the document had been distributed only to people with security clearances. "It wipes out all the ambiguity," Mr. Wolf said.
President Clinton has called the agreement, negotiated over 13 years, a cornerstone of bilateral relations. It helps clear the way for China to join the World Trade Organization, the regulatory agency in Geneva. More broadly, it enshrines in print China's commitment to allow capitalism -- at least as far as next-day courier services, life insurance policies and nonrefractory mortars add up to capitalism -- to spread to most regions and most corners of the economy.
Mr. Clinton faces perhaps his last big legislative battle to have Congress agree to a step that would let American companies benefit from the pact, granting China permanent normal trade status. Congress would sacrifice its annual review of China's trade status, in effect providing Beijing the same trading rights in the United States that most other nations have.
The mood of Congress is mixed. Although many lawmakers argue that that the accord is a clear winner for United States companies, some Republicans and Democrats alike say China does not deserve permanent rights because it violates international standards of human rights and threatens to use force against Taiwan. Clinton administration officials have called the vote, which they hope to have by Memorial Day, too close to call.
The administration has summarized the main benefits of the agreement for months, but the text was kept classified until today. Both sides agreed to keep it secret while China was negotiating with other nations to join the W.T.O.
Though lawmakers, their aides and some executives viewed the text in secure rooms, supporters of the accord demanded that the administration release it publicly. The secrecy had become a potent issue for unions and consumer groups opposed to giving China permanent trading rights.
Some critics have argued that the administration and the World Trade Organization have conspired to keep many trade issues under wraps because they fear public scrutiny.
The administration sought China's approval to release the text early. Beijing agreed, in its eagerness to win the vote in Congress.
Representative David Dreier, a California Republican who supports permanent status, said the release could clear up lingering uncertainties. "This makes the job of explaining the concrete benefits of bringing China into the rules-based trading system a little easier," he said.
But some lawmakers who say they are wary about permanent status said the release had not turned them into supporters. "It's a little late," said Senator Paul Wellstone, Democrat of Minnesota. He said the administration was trying to rush a vote.
With the agreement's reading like a complex arms-control treaty, it is a sweeping blueprint for commercial relations between China and the United States well into the 21st century. Rarely has the United States pinned down a trading partner on so many elements of business life.
The biggest breakthroughs would be in farm products, where China dropped nontariff barriers to imports of virtually everything from wheat to harvesters, though many such goods would remain subject to quotas.
The United States says China made another concession when it let Washington treat it as a nonmarket economy for 15 years. That gives Washington leeway to impose duties on imports from China if it decides that China is flooding the American market with goods produced below cost.
But the document, several inches thick, is perhaps more notable for its breadth than any of the specifics.
The agreement charts how many films foreign producers could show each year in Chinese movie theaters (20), when foreign banks could start dealing in Chinese currency (two years after it joins the trade organization) and what equity foreign telecommunications companies could hold in Chinese mobile phone services (49 percent).
The pact would establish a tariff on truffles for 2004 (25 percent). It dictates when foreign insurers can begin selling policies in Dalian (no later than 2002).
The agreement looks more like a work in progress than a polished communique. In part because negotiators were racing to complete the agreement in November before the meeting of trade ministers in Seattle, many sensitive areas were settled by 11th-hour scribbling in the margins.
One notation made sure that foreign financial leasing services would be allowed to operate as soon as China let domestic companies engage in such leasing.
And at the last minute, the Americans apparently agreed to shorten the period for treating China as a nonmarket economy, to the 15 years from 20.
Washington has had a hard time enforcing earlier trade accords with China when commitments and timetables were vague. And the bureaucracy and regional governments have sometimes been slow to comply with pacts signed in Beijing.
This time, Charlene Barshefsky, the United States trade representative, decided to leave little to chance, supporters of the agreement said.
"If you don't have that kind of detail, three years later you will discover loopholes," said Mickey Kantor, Mr. Clinton's former chief trade official who is now a trade lawyer.

GRAPHIC: Chart: "NEGOTIATION: Getting the Details Right"
The trade agreement that the United States and China signed last November, which was released yesterday by the Clinton administration, offers a telling glimpse into the negotiating process: Christina Lund, a United States trade representative negotiator, and Qi Honger, a Chinese negotiator, were haggling over the fine print until the last moment, so that handwritten changes were part of the final agreement.
 
AT ISSUE: This page of the agreement deals with the percentage of foreign ownership permitted for securities firms doing fund management business in China, once China enters the W.T.O.
The two sides agreed to cut back the ownership allowed initially, to 33% from 49% in the original draft text.
A clause was added to increase the figure to 49% by Jan. 1, 2003.
The word management was inserted between investment and fund.
Along the way, the two negotiators initialed each of the changes.

HEADLINE: U.N. Chief Assesses Benefits to Iraq of Oil-for-Food Program

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE 

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, March 14

 BODY:
Iraq has raised more than $13 billion for food, medicines and other vital supplies under a United Nations plan that allows it to sell some oil under international sanctions, says a report sent today by Secretary General Kofi Annan to the Security Council.
From December 1996 until last December, Iraq sold more than $20 billion worth of oil under the restricted sales program to meet the most urgent needs of its citizens. Since December, as a gesture to Iraq, there has been no ceiling on Iraqi exports, and billions of dollars in additional imports are already on order, and purchases have expanded beyond food and medicine. A Security Council sanctions committee also has relinquished oversight of imports of essentials like food, medicines and basic educational and agricultural supplies. 
 Despite some persistent problems, the money has rolled in, inflated by record oil prices, and Iraq's orders have become more ambitious, often including heavy equipment for large infrastructure projects. But as the range of purchases has expanded, more contracts face tougher scrutiny by the Security Council sanctions committee, particularly by the United States, which has delayed approval of about 1,000 contracts. Mr. Annan's report looks for ways to minimize those holds, which tie up hundreds of millions of dollars. The report is scheduled to be debated by the Security Council on March 24.
This is a critical moment in United Nations relations with Iraq, and the success or failure of the oil sales program plays an important role in the debate over how long sanctions, imposed in 1990 after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, can be maintained, diplomatically or even morally, in the view of some diplomats. Iraq is stepping up efforts to portray the sanctions as unacceptably inhumane as a new United Nations chief arms inspector, Hans Blix of Sweden, prepares a new system that will again require the Iraqis to cooperate or to face a continued embargo.
Mr. Blix will have to travel to Iraq in coming months to determine his program of work. So far, the Iraqis have given no indication that they will allow him to make the trip.
At a news conference on Monday, Sergey Lavrov, Russia's representative at the United Nations, who is seen as closest to the Iraqis, gave the Iraqis no encouragement but instead took a conciliatory stand toward those who are more suspicious of President Saddam Hussein. He said Russia was not proposing to exempt the Iraqis from accountability even though he abstained in the Security Council when the new inspection system was created.
"We must be convinced that there can be no threat of weapons of mass destruction coming from Iraq," he said.
In Washington, officials say they are also looking for ways to speed up the import-approval process for the Iraqis, but they remain very suspicious that Iraq will hide purchases that could go into secret arms programs. American diplomats say 85 percent to 90 percent of Iraqi purchases go through, however.
In his report, Mr. Annan spread the blame for orders put on hold but referred again and again to the negative impact they have. Contractors are often vague, he said, and the Iraqis do not always sign and submit contracts expeditiously. United Nations agencies working in Iraq do not enforce rules about the proper submission of contracts, he wrote, giving them until Aug. 31 to improve their procurement procedures.
Mr. Annan was critical of the failure of the Security Council to approve an increase to $600 million from $300 million for spare parts for Iraq's disintegrating oil industry, which has become an environmental hazard, say independent experts hired by the United Nations. Oil production will soon be unsustainable at present levels, the report says.
In listing the successes of the oil-sales program, Mr. Annan pointed to the rising caloric value of basic foods provided and the introduction of dairy products in the "food basket" supplied to 24 million Iraqis.
In health care, Mr. Annan noted that while there were still shortcomings in water and sanitation, "bacteriological analyses in 1999 showed drops of between 20 and 90 percent in contamination in all but two of the 15 governates," the Iraqi equivalent of a province or state, the report said.
"Likewise, as drugs became more widely available at all levels of health facilities," the report said, "patient attendance increased by 46 percent and some 90 percent of the essential drug needs of the hospitals were met."
Despite advances in Iraq, the oil-for-food plan has come under sustained criticism from the last two administrators of the program there, Dennis Halliday and Hans von Sponeck, who have deemed it to be too little too late for the people of Iraq.
Mr. Annan cautions in his report that the program should not be considered a development plan for Iraq, but rather an exceptional and complicated project to fill gaps in Iraq's own public projects because of the effects of sanctions. "The program was never intended to meet all the humanitarian needs, and must be assessed in that context," he said.

HEADLINE: The Selling of The Los Angeles Times

 BODY:
The trend toward consolidation of newspaper ownership is by no means new, but the Tribune Company of Chicago's agreement to purchase the Times Mirror Company offers several lessons about the economic and journalistic issues involved in today's mergers. 
 One is that the concept of "newspaper chains" is rapidly becoming outdated by investor and marketing pressures to form multimedia companies that stretch across newspapers, broadcasting and the Internet. The Tribune Company, which will now own 11 daily newspapers, 22 television stations and a major share of America Online, has been one of the most aggressive of traditional media companies in exploring ways to expand its reach. This $6.45 billion acquisition positions it powerfully for the new game of finding multiple uses for content from one medium -- newspapers, for example -- in other media, say its broadcast and Internet outlets. This convergence of content from different media has huge implications for publishing, programming, advertising and marketing.
The new media environment has also touched off a churning debate among journalists about professional standards and the task of insulating news coverage from commercial pressures. Some members of The Los Angeles Times, including its highly regarded former publisher, Otis Chandler, saw the takeover by The Chicago Tribune's parent company as a positive sign. For the past five years the Times Mirror chairman, Mark Willes, a former cereal company executive, had tried to dismantle the traditional wall between the editorial and business sides of The Los Angeles Times. While Mr. Willes drove up Times Mirror stock, he lost the confidence of the paper's journalists and drew Mr. Chandler's public condemnation. Now the combined company's newspaper operations will fall under the direction of Jack Fuller, president of the Tribune Company's publishing unit and a former editor who has written extensively about preserving journalistic standards in the new media environment.
Still, there is shock in Los Angeles that the Chandler family, which owned the paper for 119 years and helped shape the city and state, was no longer in control, just as there was shock in Boston when The New York Times Company purchased The Globe from its longtime owners, the Taylor family, in 1993. The Chandler family's share of the new company is worth over $1 billion at current stock values, but the newspaper industry -- and family-controlled newspapers like this one -- will read a managerial as well as a financial lesson into Times Mirror's decision to sell. Discord among the family shareholders led to the Willes regime in Los Angeles and ultimately to a change in ownership. Many smaller papers, such as The Louisville Courier-Journal, have fallen victim to such disunity, but no one had expected the largest and most important newspaper in the West to change hands so abruptly. Then again, no one expected the newspaper that was made into a national force by Mr. Chandler to experience the journalistic turmoil brought about by Mr. Willes.

HEADLINE: MORTGAGED LIVES: Aspecial report.;
Profiting From Fine Print With Wall Street's Help

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES with LOWELL BERGMAN; A segment based on the reporting in this article will televised tonight on the ABC News program '20/20.' It is the first broadcast under an agreement between The New York Times and ABC News.

 BODY:
Bernae Gunderson, a certified paralegal who lives in St. Paul, is not intimidated by fine print. But she was still puzzled by the mortgage documents she got in May 1998 from the First Alliance Corporation. This did not sound like the affordable home equity loan that she and her husband had been promised.
So about 2:30 p.m. on May 26, Mrs. Gunderson called the manager of the mortgage company's local office and asked all the right questions about rates, monthly payments and fees. And she got reassuring answers that confirmed her understanding of the terms of her loan. 
 But those comforting answers were mostly lies, as revealed in a tape-recording Mrs. Gunderson made of her conversation to play later for her husband, Scott. In fact, $13,000 in fees was added to the loan, and its interest rate was designed to rise a full percentage point every six months. Facing mortgage payments already $150 a month higher than when they first closed on the loan, Mr. and Mrs. Gunderson have been forced to work as much as 10 extra hours a week to meet their payments.
"We have three children, and an extra $150 a month really can help out for clothing and everything else," Mr. Gunderson said in a recent interview. "It does make a lot of difference."
Mrs. Gunderson added, "The stress is unbearable."
The Gundersons are among scores of consumers who have complained to state regulators about First Alliance, a national home-equity lender based in Irvine, Calif. More than a dozen homeowners have already sued. They all assert that the company has used a deceptive sales pitch, delivered by loan officers recruited from big auto dealerships, to lure homeowners into high-cost loans that expose them to the threat of foreclosure and financial ruin.
The company, which steadfastly denies wrongdoing, has also been sued by the AARP and by regulators in five states. One, Washington State, is seeking to suspend it from doing any business there. A California appeals court concluded last year that the company "trained its employees to use various methods, including deception, to sell its services." The federal Justice Department is investigating First Alliance, and the company has withdrawn from an industry trade association because of negative publicity.
But First Alliance still has some very important supporters: the investment banks on Wall Street that help it raise the money lent to people like the Gundersons. Those banks began raising significant amounts of money for the company in the early 1990's, after it had already come under investigation in California for discriminatory lending. An investigation by The New York Times and the ABC News program "20/20" shows they have pumped hundreds of millions of dollars more into First Alliance in recent years, even as civil lawsuits and state investigations have raised increasingly troubling questions about First Alliance's business practices.
The money raised by Wall Street for First Alliance and dozens of similar companies has financed a quiet revolution in the financial habits of millions of Americans whose low incomes or blemished credit histories otherwise prevented them from obtaining conventional loans. Such subprime borrowers, as they are called in the lending industry, have turned in increasing numbers to finance companies that cover the risk of default by charging them significantly higher fees and interest rates.
Since 1989, Wall Street investment banks have sold more than $316.2 billion in bonds for subprime lenders -- more than twice the dollar amount of the high-yield, or junk, bonds that companies used to finance takeovers in the 1980's. First Alliance has been a big beneficiary of these new mortgage bonds, receiving nearly $2 billion the last decade, including $103 million raised through Lehman Brothers just three months ago.
William J. Ahearn, a spokesman for Lehman, said the firm's role in selling bonds backed by subprime loans, known in the financial world as underwriting, includes a careful review to make sure investors have the facts they need. He said that Lehman officials were fully aware of First Alliance's legal problems and believed that the company had stepped up its efforts the last 18 months to prevent abuses. Lehman, he said, is an "underwriter, not a regulator."
For much of the last decade, the federal government has largely left regulation of the industry to the states, despite a series of Congressional hearings that revealed rampant abuses. The first round of hearings, in 1994, established that many companies were taking advantage of unsophisticated homeowners -- many of them minorities; the second round, in 1998, suggested that the problems were spreading nationwide.
The testimony did not dissuade Wall Street investment banks from vastly expanding their stake in the industry. They have financed lending operations, helped companies sell shares to the public and, in some cases, formed partnerships with the companies.
Consumer advocates contend that First Alliance, whose actions have been extensively documented in court cases and regulatory actions, is typical of an industry that often preys on low- and middle-income people desperate to escape financial difficulties. Industry officials say, however, that subprime lenders can provide a valuable service to consumers whose credit records otherwise disqualify them for conventional loans.
For its part, First Alliance denies "in the strongest terms" that it has a companywide practice of deceiving borrowers and has described some cases cited in regulatory documents as isolated misunderstandings involving a few loan officers. It says it is providing a service to people who would otherwise be unable to obtain credit, and insists that its fees -- which it says are now lower, on average, than they once were -- are justified by the dangers of lending money to the nation's riskiest borrowers.
"First Alliance's business model is to charge a higher origination fee than most, offset by a lower interest rate than most," explained Brian Chisick, the company's founder and chief executive. That, he continued, gives consumers lower monthly payments and lower total payments over the life of the loan.
"Most borrowers are much more concerned about their monthly payment than the amount of any fees," he added.
Critics counter that, in fact, many First Alliance borrowers -- who regulators say are largely people with decent credit histories -- wind up paying higher fees on top of higher interest rates than are justified by the risks the lender is taking.
While a few regulators have challenged the high fees, most of the litigation currently pending against First Alliance focuses on the elaborate script its loan officers have been trained to use. The script, regulators say, is designed to deflect questions about rates and fees, swamp borrowers under masses of needless detail and foster a trusting atmosphere that would encourage customers to lower their guard.
But Mrs. Gunderson was still wary enough to double-check her loan with First Alliance, and to tape the call on her telephone answering machine.
Worried about the $13,000 in fees, she sought confirmation that her loan was for about $47,000.
"Right, your amount financed is $46,172," the loan officer, Brian Caffrey, assured her. "That doesn't change."
"Right, right," she continued. "And then the $13,000 goes on top of that? And then interest is charged?"
"No, no, no," he responded.
But the answer should have been yes, yes, yes -- the fees were added to the $46,172 that the Gundersons thought they had borrowed, and they are paying interest on those fees over the life of the loan.
Mr. Caffrey said in a recent interview that he was just following the script First Alliance trained him to use -- an explanation strongly disputed by Mr. Chisick, who said all company loan officers "are specifically trained to insure borrower understanding of all aspects of their loan."
Mrs. Gunderson later shared her tape-recording with the Minnesota attorney general's office, which attached a transcript of it to court documents filed in its case against First Alliance.
"Everything they told us made sense," she said, "but they were lying through their teeth. And they told all kinds of people the same things that they told us. We just happened to be lucky enough to push a button."
 
The Business
Making Loans By the Script
At age 60, Brian Chisick has the tanned, broad-shouldered good looks of a native California surfer. But he was born in London, where he lived until age 14, when his family moved to Vancouver, British Columbia. In 1963, he relocated to Orange County, Calif., where after a briefly varied career -- he once sold office machines, for example -- he found his way into the mortgage business.
In 1971, he and his wife, Sarah, opened the First Alliance Mortgage Company, a consumer finance company that would ultimately rely on two sources of strength: an aggressive sales force recruited from auto dealerships and a ready access to Wall Street.
In its early days, his company was just one of many mom-and-pop consumer finance companies that competed, with only middling success, against stronger savings and loan institutions and commercial banks. But before First Alliance was a decade old, rocketing interest rates and financial deregulation had turned its world upside down.
In 1980, in an effort to salvage the battered savings and loan industry, Congress effectively repealed most state laws limiting the interest rates that lenders could charge for first mortgages on residential property. Two years later, Congress erased most state restrictions on "alternative" loans, including adjustable-rate mortgages.
These steps, intended to help the savings and loan industry, also benefited small consumer finance companies like Mr. Chisick's. Over the next decade their share of the home equity loan market exploded, rising to 32 percent in 1989 from less than 0.5 percent in 1977, according to a recent study by Cathy Lesser Mansfield, a consumer law professor at Drake University in Des Moines.
Mr. Chisick's company flourished in this new competitive environment, and by 1988 he had opened lending offices in seven communities across California. To staff them, he recruited highly paid automobile sales representatives, who were at ease with the "hard sell" but tired of the long evening hours and weekend work that auto sales involved.
Recruits were required to commit to memory an elaborate 27-page sales pitch -- known in the early days as "The Loan Officer's Track to Run On," later shortened to the Track. According to court documents filed in a 1988 case in California, loan officers were drilled until they could deliver the sales message flawlessly, slipping back into the script regardless of the questions customers might raise.
"Establish a common bond," the loan officers were taught. "Find this early in the conversation to make the customer lower his guard." The script listed good bond-building topics (family, jobs, children and pets) and emphasized, "It's really important to get them laughing."
It offered another bit of advice: "To soften the blow of dollar amounts, say: 'merely,' 'simply,' 'only,' 'as you know.' "
And if the customer asks questions about the rate and the fees? Just say, "May I ignore your concern about the rate and costs if I can show you that these are minor issues in a loan?"
The company insisted that its employees stick to the script, and managers monitored the loan officers over office intercom systems to make sure they did, according to court documents and numerous interviews with former employees.
In 1988, with testimony from several company whistle-blowers, lawyers for the California Department of Corporations accused the company of imposing harsher terms on loans made to homeowners in neighborhoods with high minority populations -- areas that loan officers referred to as "never-never land," according to the state's lawsuit. Regulators also complained that the company's sales pitch deliberately obscured the high points and other fees that borrowers paid.
Mr. Chisick's lawyers denied racial discrimination and said the "never-never land" list had been prepared by some unknown employee, had not been used for at least five years and had never been sanctioned by First Alliance management. In April 1989, First Alliance paid $420,000 to settle the state lawsuit, denying wrongdoing but submitting to two years of state monitoring and agreeing to conduct racial sensitivity training for its staff.
Eight months later, a consumer class-action suit filed in Oakland accused the company of fraudulently concealing its fees and imposing excessive and unjustified charges on borrowers. In 1994, again without acknowledging any liability, the company paid $6.85 million to settle the case.
In its early days, First Alliance raised money for its operations primarily by selling bundles of loans directly to private investors. But in 1993, despite its earlier regulatory trouble and the still-pending consumer lawsuit, it tapped into a much deeper, less expensive source of fresh capital: Wall Street.
The sale of bonds backed by packages of lower-quality mortgage loans was not a new idea, and some small deals had been done as early as 1989. But by the mid-1990's, with professional investors hungry for higher-yielding investments, major Wall Street investment banks stepped up the volume of loan-backed bonds sold to pension funds and other institutions. Suddenly, a vastly larger pool of money became available to subprime lenders like First Alliance.
The process works like this: Wall Street bankers invite investors, typically large institutions like pensions funds and universities, to buy certificates that pay an attractive interest rate over many years. The money raised from those investors is then used to buy groups of loans taken out by consumers through companies like First Alliance. The borrowers' monthly payments cover the interest paid to investors plus a profit to First Alliance. The certificates are roughly equivalent to mutual fund shares, with investors owning a portfolio of loans rather than stocks or bonds.
Between 1994 and 1996, the amount of money raised on Wall Street for subprime lenders rocketed. In 1996 nearly $40 billion worth of subprime loan notes were sold, up from just over $10 billion the year before; within two years, the annual volume was $87 billion.
The business was attractive to Wall Street for two reasons. First, investment banks collected fees for arranging the deals -- usually about a third of a penny for every dollar raised. Second, doing the deals gave the investment bankers a steady supply of the popular high-yielding mortgage notes to sell to their institutional customers, who would otherwise shop elsewhere.
By 1996, most of the big investment banks on Wall Street, and some large commercial banks, had plunged into the subprime business; the resulting flood of cash was like a dose of steroids for the industry.
With Wall Street's demand in overdrive, "lenders and mortgage brokers went out and tried to make as many loans as they could to meet the demand," explained Jeffrey Zeltzer, executive director of the National Home Equity Mortgage Association, which represents subprime lenders.
First Alliance was one of the big beneficiaries of this development. John D. Dewey, the consultant who advised the company on its first Wall Street deals, recalled that its business grew more than sixfold once it had access to mortgage market financing.
Its profitability improved significantly as well, since it was paying around 6 percent interest on the money it raised on Wall Street and could lend that money to consumers at an average interest rate of 14 percent, Mr. Dewey said.
The company expanded, and today operates in more than a dozen states from Washington to Florida. California remains its biggest source of customers, but New York, New Jersey and Illinois are close behind.
Buoyed by the robust health that Wall Street's money had generated, First Alliance was able to sell its own shares to public investors in 1996, in a deal that allowed the Chisicks to draw $135 million out of the company. While not politically active, they were generous with their new wealth, contributing to a religious academy in Huntington Beach, Calif., and building the Chisick Auditorium for the Jewish Community Center of Orange County.
The Chisicks' three sons, Jamie, Brad and Mark, have followed their parents into the subprime lending business, operating two affiliated lending companies that have had their own troubles with regulators in recent years.
But life is not all mortgages and philanthropy for the Chisicks. They are listed in property records as the owners of an expensive condominium in Honolulu and a home in a gated community in Santa Ana, Calif., which they bought after their successful public stock offering in 1996.
The year the Chisicks finally grasped the brass ring of extraordinary wealth was also the year that a number of elderly First Alliance customers in the San Jose area began to worry about losing the roofs over their heads.
 
The Borrowers
Facing Ruin Under a Pile of Fees
First Alliance says it charges high fees because its borrowers have less-than-perfect credit records and are more likely to default on their loans.
But the company tells a different tale to Wall Street. In documents intended to attract investors, it points out that more than three-fourths of its loans are made to people with relatively good credit histories.
A former loan officer said the company mades little effort to distinguish between customers with poor records and those with good credit history, who would qualify for conventional loans.
At First Alliance, "customers with 'A' credit would pay the same high loan fees as customers with 'D' credit," according to a sworn affidavit by Greg Walling, a First Alliance loan-officer-turned-whistle-blower who has cooperated with various state regulators. His suburban Minneapolis office was a few dozen yards from a conventional branch bank, he said in a recent interview. "I wanted to tell some of my better customers that every step they took from my door to that bank would save them $1,000 on their loan," he said.
He was not exaggerating. Court record show that the company has charged loan origination fees, called points, of 25 percent or more on some loans, in addition to high interest rates and big penalties for early repayment.
In his statement, Mr. Chiswick said the company had recently reduced its origination fees to an average of about 10 percent because of what he called the "sound-bite effect of the high origination fees."
Few conventional lenders charge origination fees of more than two points on a loan -- that is 2 percent of the total amount -- and many state regulators consider fees of more than eight points to be indefensible.
For someone borrowing $100,000 from First Alliance, a fee of 25 points adds $25,000 to the amount on which the customer is paying interest.
The calculation has become all too familiar to Velda Durney, one of the homeowners who have sued First Alliance.
Mrs. Durney's brother built her sage-green ranch house in Fremont, Calif., outside San Jose, in the summer of 1966. It is filled with evidence of a life well lived: photographs of happy school-age grandchildren, fresh-baked carrot cakes cooling in the kitchen, a bowling-trophy-laden sideboard, pushed aside to make room for a quilting frame.
Her husband died soon after the house was finished, and she raised her six children there alone, working for 23 years as a sales clerk at Sears. She managed on a small pension and Social Security -- until August 1996, when she refinanced her home through First Alliance.
Mrs. Durney believed she had signed for an 8.5 percent adjustable-rate mortgage for $51,493 that would consolidate a few credit card bills and lower her total monthly payments. In fact, after more than 26 points in fees were added, her loan was for $64,590, and its rate was scheduled to climb every six months until her monthly payments would equal or exceed her original mortgage payments.
Her income simply would not stretch that far, and she began to have nightmares that she would lose her home.
Asked about that loan in an interview in January, the capable Mrs. Durney slumped into a kitchen chair, tears suddenly spilling from behind her stylish wire-framed glasses.
"I can't talk about it without crying," she apologized. "It took away every shred of self-confidence I had."
Besides her peace of mind, she has also lost her privacy. She had to refinance again to get a fixed-rate mortgage, and her monthly payments are still bigger than her pension income will cover. So she makes ends meet, she said, by renting out her two spare bedrooms -- which she had done as a favor to church acquaintances in the past but now does with strangers, by necessity.
"I'm getting by," she said last week, "but just barely."
Mr. Chisick said he could not comment extensively on the case because it was still in litigation, but he denied wrongdoing. He added, "All borrowers are given two separate three-day periods to reject the terms of the obligation. She decided not to."
Ed and Joanne Pagter, who lived in nearby Santa Clara, had their own money worries as 1996 began. Mr. Pagter, then 67, ran a part-time pool maintenance business that added about $800 a month to the $735 he got from Social Security. But he was suffering from severe kidney disease and was unsure how long he would be able to work. Mrs. Pagter, who earned just over $2,100 a month, was nearing retirement from her job at a corporate cafeteria service.
They had abundant equity in their home, but their main financial problem was an adjustable-rate mortgage that was scheduled to increase on Jan. 1 unless they could replace it with a loan that required lower monthly payments.
First Alliance, which had been calling them weekly for several years, assured them that they could. So in January 1996, the couple went to the company's San Jose office.
According to a lawsuit they later filed, the Pagters told Jeffrey E. A. Phillips, a First Alliance loan officer, that their goal was to keep payments as low as possible for the next year so that they could save more, and then to sell their home after Mrs. Pagter retired and to buy a house near their daughter, who lives in Lemoore, Calif.
The Pagters say they were rushed through the closing, signing documents they were not given time to read. No lawyer was present, as is typical in home equity loans. Not until October 1996, when they were selling their Santa Clara home and trying to close on their new one, did they discover the exact terms of their loan, according to their lawsuit.
They had actually borrowed $170,264 from First Alliance -- including an origination fee of 13 points, or $19,950 -- not $147,000 as they believed. This reduced the equity they had in the old home, so they had to borrow more money quickly to close on the new house.
 
The Counterattack
Building a Case Against Deception
Looking for help, the Pagters turned to Steinbock & Hofmann, a three-person San Jose law firm that was already representing a number of elderly homeowners with very similar complaints against First Alliance.
The cases became the special passion of Sheila Canavan, the firm's associate. Working on a shoestring -- and chided by friends who saw parallels with the financially doomed lawyers in the movie "A Civil Action" -- the firm was representing five other homeowners, all complaining of deceptive sales practices by First Alliance.
At the same time, investigators in the Department of Financial Institutions in Olympia, Wash., had opened a file on First Alliance, on the basis of 17 consumer complaints similar to those made by Mrs. Durney and the Pagters.
State officials immediately focused on a 1996 version of the Track, the sales script that the company's loan officers used in their dealings with customers. In June 1997, in an affidavit filed in state court, the lead investigator, Chuck Cross, observed that First Alliance's intent "appears to be to continually play down the import of certain disclosures, misdirect crucial information or confuse the borrower about what they are actually obtaining in the transaction."
Mr. Cross was especially concerned that the script borrowed terms from the federal disclosure documents, like "amount financed," and gave them new and misleading definitions. Loan origination fees were never called "points," he said, but instead "prepaid finance charges," or "minimum finance charges." And they were labeled estimates when they were actually firm amounts.
Regulators in other states sought copies of that 1996 sales script, but First Alliance obtained a court order requiring Washington regulators to keep the document secret -- an order that remains in place today. (Last March, First Alliance notified the state that it intended to sue Mr. Cross and his superiors for defamation.)
By the end of 1997, Ms. Canavan and her partners in San Jose had filed lawsuits against First Alliance on behalf of the Pagters, Mrs. Durney and four other area homeowners. The company mounted an aggressive defense, insisting that all the terms on the loans had been fully and clearly disclosed. Company lawyers pointed out that by signing closing statements, borrowers had attested to fully understanding the terms of their loans.
Several borrowers in the lawsuit said they had signed the forms in a rush, without having had time to examine them carefully. Others said they had been advised to ignore information in the forms that differed from what they had been told by a loan officer. Still others said they had been assured that the information was in error and would be corrected, or depicted a worst-case situation that was unlikely to arise.
Meanwhile, the Pagter case in San Jose began to inch toward trial. The company tried to shunt the case off to arbitration, but a state appeals court, in a crucial ruling, concluded that the elderly couple's signature on a form agreeing to forgo lawsuits had been "obtained by fraud."
In the decision, the court sharply criticized First Alliance, which it said had "trained its employees to use various methods, including deception, to sell its services."
In his written response, Mr. Chisick called the ruling "incorrect" and "a blatant error."
The ruling, in February 1999, gave the Pagters hope, but settlement discussions with First Alliance dragged through 1999 and broke off inconclusively early this year. It was not until a day after a jury had been chosen for a January trial in San Jose that First Alliance agreed to pay an undisclosed sum to settle the case.
"Ed and I used to joke that they were just waiting for us all to die," said Mrs. Pagter. The joke was prophetic. Mr. Pagter died last October.
Asked why First Alliance had delayed a settlement for so long, given Mr. Pagter's ill health, Mr. Chisick said, "Mr. Pagter was ill when he borrowed the money, so the advancement of his illness was not a factor."
 
Growing Opposition
Picking Up Allies With Influence
Even an attentive Wall Street investment banker might have missed the early local headlines critical of First Alliance. But the company's legal troubles attracted national attention in May 1998, when the Pagters and their fellow plaintiffs gained a powerful new ally in their fight: the giant AARP.
Jean Constantine Davis, a staff lawyer, said the AARP had been approached by Ms. Canavan's firm and "decided this was definitely something we wanted to look into."
The organization was taking advantage of an unusual facet of California's business laws, called Section 17200, that allows a plaintiff to sue as a "private attorney general," seeking restitution on behalf of all citizens affected by certain deceptive business practices.
State regulators, too, were heading to court. By the end of 1998, Minnesota's attorney general at the time, Hubert H. Humphrey III, had sued First Alliance, accusing it of deceptive sales practices. In Massachusetts, an assistant attorney general, Pamela S. Kogut, had obtained a temporary injunction forcing the company to limit its origination fees to eight points -- although a top company executive had argued in court that the company could not make a profit with fees that low. And in Illinois, Attorney General Jim Ryan was suing as well, seeking remedies that included the rescission of all the loans First Alliance has made there.
Steve LeClair, an assistant attorney general in Florida, says that his staff has subpoenaed a "very large volume of records" and is talking with First Alliance "to see if this is something we can resolve without filing a formal complaint."
Florida's primary concern is the origination fees. "They're just so excessively high that it's hard for me to conceive of any way a consumer would agree to that kind of loan if all the facts have been put before them," Mr. LeClair said.
Last April, after years of legal fencing with First Alliance, Washington State regulators finally filed a formal complaint against the company, seeking to suspend its license for two years and to obtain an order that it discontinue deceptive practices.
And in September, First Alliance agreed to settle the consumer protection lawsuits filed against it in Minnesota. While acknowledging no wrongdoing, the company agreed to offer each of its Minnesota customers $4,000 to $6,000 and to read any new customers a simple court-ordered description of its fees and rates before any loan discussions were begun.
Prentiss Cox, a Minnesota assistant attorney general, says the company no longer does business in his state. "That kind of relief suggests the strength of our allegations in the case," he said.
But at best, regulatory efforts like Minnesota's can only protect a statewide segment of consumers; companies can short-circuit such investigations simply by pulling out of one state and moving into another. Some states have strong, clear consumer lending laws and well-financed regulatory agencies -- but others do not.
The early waves of scandal from the subprime industry a decade ago prompted Congress in 1994 to adopt legislation requiring greater disclosure by high-cost lenders, but federal action to enforce those laws has been rare. Indeed, the Federal Trade Commission filed the first disciplinary cases under the 1994 law just last summer.
And yet none of these legal problems seems to shake Wall Street's faith in First Alliance or most of the other large subprime lenders that have been the targets of consumer advocates' complaints. To be sure, the high-yield mortgage market grew a bit jittery in late 1998, after revelations of some subprime lenders' questionable accounting practices. But last year, there were more than 200 separate deals totaling more than $75 billion -- less than in 1998 but more than in any other previous year.
 
The Wall Streeters
Raising Money In the Best Circles
No Wall Street investment bank had a bigger share of that reviving 1999 market than Lehman Brothers, Wall Street's fourth-largest brokerage house and one of its oldest and most prestigious names.
First Alliance's initial public offering in 1996 was handled by Friedman Billings & Ramsey, a small investment bank based in Arlington, Va. But through the late 1990's, First Alliance had raised money through a variety of bigger banks and brokerage houses, including Prudential Securities. Then about two years ago, as the AARP lawsuit was added to First Alliance's legal troubles, Lehman Brothers became the company's primary source of financing. In all, it has handled eight separate deals for the company.
Lehman Brothers has not only helped raise money for First Alliance despite its mounting legal troubles but, more recently, has taken a small investment stake in the firm.
Mr. Ahearn, the Lehman spokesman, pointed out that the brokerage house's deals for First Alliance "have been relatively small" compared with Lehman's deals for other companies. And he emphasized that all of First Alliance's mounting legal troubles were carefully reviewed by Lehman and fully disclosed to investors who bought the notes backed by First Alliance mortgages.
Nor did First Alliance's legal difficulties dissuade another important Wall Street supporter: MBIA Insurance, the giant financial insurance company, which has stood behind many of First Alliance's loan deals over the years, guaranteeing that principal and interest will be paid to investors promptly. With MBIA's backing, First Alliance's mortgage-backed notes were awarded Wall Street's highest credit ratings, making them more attractive to institutional investors.
Bruce Legan, a managing director of MBIA, said that his company became increasingly concerned last year about the problem of predatory lending in the subprime market and that it had recently expanded the scope of its review of each subprime deal it agreed to insure.
First Alliance is one of the lenders that have come under greater scrutiny, Mr. Legan confirmed. The insurer's lawyers have reviewed the litigation against the company, he explained, and a major accounting firm conducted "a very extensive review at the operational level."
Mr. Legan declined to say what records had been examined for the assessment, but said: "We have not uncovered evidence that they are engaged in predatory lending."
MBIA's review does not appear to have included interviews with the lawyers or regulators suing First Alliance. Neither Ms. Canavan in San Jose nor regulators in other states can recall any inquiry from MBIA lawyers -- or anyone else on Wall Street -- about the strength of the evidence against First Alliance.
State regulators' investigations of the company have focused thus far on possible deceptive sales practices and have not yet examined where and how its money was raised.
Some legal theorists say Lehman and other banks that finance the industry can be held accountable under the law passed by Congress in 1994. It holds that borrowers' legal claims against their lenders can also be asserted against any subsequent purchasers of the loans. Some state laws may also provide a weapon, according to experts who cite a well-established legal principle in most states: those who knowingly finance illegal behavior can be held liable for it.
Meanwhile, Mr. Ahearn said that Lehman believed it had fulfilled its legal responsibilities.
The current system "is perfect for washing everybody's hands of any responsibility," said Joshua Zinner, coordinator of a foreclosure prevention project at South Brooklyn Legal Services. "At each step, it gets harder and harder to hold anybody accountable."
The subprime lenders trade group, meanwhile, is "very, very concerned" about the "few rogue lenders" who give the industry a bad name, said Mr. Zeltzer, the group's executive director. He explained that the group's board has recently adopted an industry code of ethics and voluntary standards that it hopes will prevent deceptive or unfair lending practices.
"These are not very happy headlines," Mr. Zeltzer said. "This is not how we want to do business." He added that Wall Street's financing of the "bad apples" as well as the good ones did not "make our job any easier."

HEADLINE: In Gun Control, Clinton and Gore Have Found a Common, Constant Theme

BYLINE: By MARC LACEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14

 BODY:
President Clinton squeezed the issue into a recent speech on China's entry into the World Trade Organization. He inserted a few lines on the matter while discussing the need for vaccines in Africa. He added it to his call for prescription drug benefits for the elderly.
Since one first grader killed another two weeks ago in Michigan, Mr. Clinton has relentlessly pressed the need for tougher gun laws from the presidential lectern. 
 "I went and met with the families that lost their children at Columbine, out in Springfield, Ore., and Jonesboro, Ark. I didn't like that," Mr. Clinton said at a fund-raiser on Monday evening in Chicago. "I'm just trying to keep more people alive."
On the campaign trail, Vice President Al Gore has been just as pointed in urging Congressional Republicans to support tougher gun laws. "If there are shootings in the first grade and still they are not willing to support child trigger locks, what will it take?" he asked last week in Buffalo. "Shootings in kindergarten? Shootings in nursery school?"
Whether the subject is gun legislation, prescription drug benefits, or the threat to the economy of excessive tax cuts, expect to hear Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore echo each other through Election Day.
The White House and the Gore campaign are in daily contact to coordinate their messages, and advisers to Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore see benefits to their respective bosses, and to Democratic candidates in general, in working from the same page.
And gun control is on the top of that page. Since the shooting at Theo J. Buell Elementary School, Mr. Clinton has bashed the National Rifle Association every chance he gets. He has lamented the tragedy of another child dead. He has urged Congress to get on with legislation. And so has Mr. Gore.
"When the president goes out and talks about guns, he's essentially saying, A, you need a Democratic president and, B, you need to change the Congress," Mark Penn, a Democratic pollster, said.
Opponents of gun control traditionally have been a small but extremely motivated voting bloc. But in this election, because of recent shootings, Mr. Penn said, "suburban women voters have come to feel the same intensity" in favor of gun laws.
The president's stepped-up advocacy of gun control illustrates a White House strategy aimed both at winning passage of whatever legislation he can in his remaining months and assuring that his agenda continues during a Gore administration.
Though the gun legislation is stalled because of a dispute about background checks for buyers at gun shows, aides to Mr. Clinton believe the president's barrage could force a compromise. Even if the status quo remains, Mr. Gore and other Democrats on the ticket will enter the fall holding a prime election issue.
"A president's power comes from the ability to frame the debate and President Clinton is very good at that," said Al From, president of the Democratic Leadership Council. "He'd like to have this as one of his final-year legislative achievements. But if he can't have it, he can help frame the debate to help his party."
Mr. Clinton seized on gun control as the issue du jour at a fund-raiser in West Palm Beach hours after news of the school shooting broke on Feb. 29. He has continued with a fury ever since in appearances in Miami; Ashburn, Va.; San Jose, Calif.; San Francisco; Cleveland, and Chicago.
Capitalizing on the public attention following the incident, Mr. Clinton called lawmakers to the White House to urge them to break the legislative logjam. Hours later, he met with the mother of the young Michigan shooting victim.
Mr. Clinton's advisers dispute the notion that they want the impasse between Congress and the White House to continue on gun control -- or any other issue.
And they reacted furiously to the suggestion by Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the National Rifle Association, that the president was politicking instead of working to resolve the issue and was "willing to accept a certain level of killing to further his political agenda."
Bruce Reed, the White House domestic policy adviser, said the president would much prefer to sign gun legislation than argue about it through the election. But Mr. Clinton has made clear that he is willing and able to do the latter.
"The vice president and Governor Bush have dramatically different positions on the whole issue of guns and I think it ought to be a big issue in the presidential election," Mr. Clinton said in an interview Sunday on ABC's "This Week."
In recent days, he also has raised the issue of guns in interviews on the "CBS Evening News," NBC's "Today" and CNN's "Burden of Proof."
President Clinton and candidate Gore began their joint crusade on the gun issue long before Kayla Renee Rolland was shot by a first-grade classmate.
At his State of the Union address, Mr. Clinton endorsed Mr. Gore's plan to require photo licenses for new gun buyers instead of a more ambitious proposal by former Senator Bill Bradley to register every handgun. Mr. Clinton endorsed the Gore plan knowing it stood no chance of being enacted during his presidency.
"This is a president who truly wants his vice president to succeed him, probably more than any other president before him," said Stephen Hess, an expert on the presidency at the Brookings Institution in Washington. "He sees that as part of his legacy, particularly because his legacy is a little shaky. What you're seeing on gun control, you're going to see with virtually every other issue."
Mr. Bush, whose opposition to Mr. Gore's gun agenda is supported by the N.R.A., is prepared for the president's intervention, according to aides. Bush advisers said that Mr. Clinton's rhetoric represented a marked contrast from how Mr. Bush would handle gun control -- through compromise intended to get results.
"One of the president's priorities in his second term is to give Al Gore what would amount to a third term," Ari Fleischer, a Bush spokesman, said. "We expect that. We're ready for that."

New Jersey Loses Jobs

BYLINE: AP 

 BODY:
New Jersey's jobless rate rose slightly in February to 4.1 percent from 3.9 percent the month before.
January's rate was below the national average and the lowest in New Jersey in nearly 11 years. The state's jobless rate is mirroring the national average, which rose to 4.1 percent in February from 4.0 percent. 
 Preliminary figures released yesterday by the New Jersey Labor Department show that employers in the state lost 1,600 jobs.
Labor Department analysts cited manufacturing losses and a snowy February, which forced construction layoffs. But they say it is no cause for concern.
In February, the manufacturing industry sustained the biggest dip, losing 2,400 jobs. Retail and construction lost 600 jobs each. The biggest gains were in the service industry, which added 1,900 jobs, primarily in business services and engineering/ management.

HEADLINE: Virtual College, or Lively Campus?

 BODY:

To the Editor:
Arthur Levine (Op-Ed, March 13) warns that we are just a few clicks away from low-overhead virtual Harvards forcing traditional institutions of higher education into bankruptcy. I don't think so -- no more so than we are at risk of all bookstores, pharmacies, museums, concert halls and houses of worship disappearing in the face of electronic alternatives. 
 Mr. Levine confuses the idea of genuine education, which depends on personal interaction among people and ideas in an intellectually and aesthetically stimulating environment, with an economic model of the efficient exchange of money for information and credentials. American universities are in far more danger from failing to sustain the conditions of high quality face-to-face education than they are from dot-competition.

MIDDLE EAST
 
ISRAEL: HOLDING ON TO VILLAGE -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak decided against transferring a West Bank village abutting Jerusalem to Palestinian control after rightists said the move would erode Israel's hold on the city and endanger Jewish neighborhoods. Anata, where Palestinians already run civil affairs, was to have come under full Palestinian control as part of a planned handover of another 6.1 percent of the West Bank. Joel Greenberg (NYT)
 
PALESTINIANS: ISRAELIS ON SYLLABUS -- The Palestinian culture minister, Yasser Abed Rabbo, said he would introduce Israeli authors into the Palestinian curriculum after a storm in Israel over the addition of a Palestinian poet to the high school syllabus. Yossi Sarid, Israel's education minister, said he and Abed Rabbo were "partners in the struggle against people living in the past." Deborah Sontag (NYT) 
 
ISRAEL: MISSILE DEFENSE DEPLOYS -- Israel's Arrow 2 antiballistic missile defense system was formally placed in operation, culminating a 14-year, $1.3 billion development program underwritten by Israel and the United States. Designed to intercept incoming missiles in the stratosphere, the Arrow 2 missiles are made by the state-owned Israel Aircrcraft Industries. William A. Orme, Jr. (NYT)
 
IRAN: HOPE VOICED FOR REFORMIST -- Saeed Hajjarian, the leading figure in the reform movement who was shot on a Tehran street, remains in "grave" condition, but a small sign of hope came with a statement by an Iranian-American brain surgeon, Dr. Jamshid Ghamjar, that the bullet that struck his head "did not pass through the brain." John F. Burns (NYT)
 
EUROPE
 
FRANCE: FUGITIVE FOUND -- A former Elf-Acquitaine oil executive, considered vital to unraveling a wide-ranging French corruption scandal, has been located in the Philippines, French justice officials say. Alfred Sirven, 73, who has been on the run for three years, is accused of paying off leading politicians as part of rampant corruption said to have taken place in the 1990's at the formerly state-owned petroleum giant. Suzanne Daley (NYT)
 
YUGOSLAVIA: STUDIO FORCED TO PAY -- The leading nongovernment television station in Serbia paid $1 million to President Slobodan Milosevic's government to avoid being closed down. Telecommunications Minister Ivan Markovic had ordered Studio B in Belgrade to pay for the use of its frequencies or face being closed. Opposition parties say pressure on Studio B is part of a larger crackdown on independent news media. (AP)
 
THE AMERICAS
 
CANADA: CHRETIEN DEFIANT -- Prime Minister Jean Chretien, defying an opinion poll in which 61 percent said someone else should lead the Liberal Party into the next election, goes into a party conference tomorrow vowing in two newspaper interviews to run for a third term. Mr. Chretien, 66, was first elected in 1993. James Brooke (NYT)
 
MEXICO: IMPORT CURB RELAXED -- Starting April 1, in a measure intended to help low-income farmers, Mexico will relax a trade barrier and allow imports of used United States and Canadian pickup trucks that are more than 10 years old, the Commerce Ministry announced. Officials reiterated that they would not allow owners of more than 1.5 million illegally imported newer vehicles to be registered. Julia Preston (NYT)
 
UNITED NATIONS
 
VATICAN'S ROLE -- More than 440 non-government organizations called for a review of the Vatican's observer status at the United Nations, which is based on the Holy See's claim to territory in Rome, not on its status as the headquarters of the Roman Catholic Church. Frances Kissling, president of Catholics for a Free Choice, said the church "debases its own nature" in seeking "secular power as a state." Resolutions opposing a review are pending in Congress. Barbara Crossette (NYT)
 
AFRICA
 
ZIMBABWE: WHITES SUE -- The Commercial Farmers' Union petitioned the High Court for help in halting a rash of farm invasions. Thousands of people, led by veterans of the 1970's struggle against white minority rule, have occupied hundreds of white-owned farms, which they say belong to the blacks whose families' land was stolen by whites decades ago. Henri E. Cauvin (NYT)
 
MOZAMBIQUE: DEBT PLEA -- After a meeting with President Joaquim Chissano, six African presidents called on the international community to cancel Mozambique's foreign debt so that it can rebuild its flood-ravaged economy, where hundreds have died and more than 200,000 are homeless. Rachel L. Swarns (NYT)
 
ASIA
 
PAKISTAN: SHARIF LAWYERS RELENT -- Lawyers for the ousted prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, have agreed to return to court, dropping demands to shift his hijacking trial out of Karachi. The lawyers had asked for the change after Iqbal Raad, a defense team member, was shot dead. Barry Bearak (NYT)
 
INDONESIA: SUHARTO IS EXAMINED -- Former President Suharto was examined at a hospital to see whether he is healthy enough to face questioning in court over accusations of corruption. His lawyers had argued that he was too weak even to visit a hospital, but he was shown on television walking, smiling and waving to a crowd of reporters. Seth Mydans (NYT)
 
MALAYSIA: GUILTY IN ANWAR ATTACK -- The former chief of the national police force, Abdul Rahim Noor, was convicted of assaulting the former deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, on the night of Mr. Anwar's arrest in September 1998. The assault left Mr. Anwar, who is still on trial on sex charges, with a much-publicized black eye. Seth Mydans (NYT)

HEADLINE: High Tech Is the Art In San Francisco

BYLINE: By SALLY McGRANE 

 BODY:
CULTURAL sea change is nothing new to the Bay Area of San Francisco, and the city that spawned the beats and psychedelia now finds itself a few degrees north of the technology revolution's epicenter. But is there room for art in the no-nonsense commercialism of the tech world, where everybody has a business plan?
The answer, it turns out, is yes, with a twist. A number of Bay Area artists are taking the technology that is transforming the area and making art with and about it. 
 Several factors make the Bay Area a fertile region for technology-related art. Artists there are surrounded by technology as dot-com companies take over industrial neighborhoods that were once artists' haunts. Splashy Internet advertising plasters billboards and dominates radio spots. There are also last year's products, discarded by the tech industry but still useful to artists, as is technological know-how.
"Technology is in the atmosphere here," said Jim Campbell, a San Francisco-based technology artist. Mr. Campbell, who works in Silicon Valley as a hardware engineer three days a week, said that the Bay Area creates an environment in which technology and art feed off each other. He is working on a piece that explores compression technology and the impact it has on information and meaning -- because, he said, "I've been working with compression in my job, making 40 or 50 pixels represent something."
Ken Goldberg, a technology artist who is also an engineering professor at the University of California at Berkeley, said there was no question that the technology revolution was making itself felt in art circles. "In some way," he said, "all artists in the Bay Area are directly or indirectly responding to technology because it is so pervasive here."
Nonetheless, art and technology often have an uneasy relationship. Rebeca Bollinger, a San Francisco artist who uses the Internet in much of her work, said she was "equally disgusted with and passionately seduced by" technology. "I try hard to be on the outside of what's going on in the industry," she said. "I get so sick and tired of all the technology propaganda. I'm sick of all the marketing.
"We're so immersed in the economy of it. If you go to other parts of the country, you see that it's totally different. But what's happening here will happen there, eventually. We're living in this strange space of present-future."
In some cases, companies and organizations in the high-tech field have embraced -- and financed -- existing art groups. Survival Research Laboratories, for instance, a prominent feature of the alternative Bay Area landscape since Mark Pauline founded it in 1978, builds large robots and creates violent spectacles where machines wreak destruction on one another. More recently, the group integrated the Internet into its art, connecting laptops to the robots and allowing remote Internet users to aim and fire powerful machinery during shows.
"Probably since 1992 all of our shows have been affiliated with organizations related to technology," said Mr. Pauline, who has created events for clients like the publisher Miller Freeman, Wired magazine and Webzine99, a San Francisco conference for Internet-based alternative magazines.
But while the booming economy has brought in money that has benefited artists, it could also impose restraints. Eric Paulos, director of the Experimental Interaction Unit, an art group, pointed out that being employed in the technology sector could limit artistic freedom, especially if an artist's projects are critical of technology.
"It's hard to do anything too controversial if you're at a dot-com," he said. "This is an incredible time because you can do creative expression -- design work -- and get paid. But if what you're doing is driven by money, you're not really in control."
Mr. Paulos said he made a point of distancing his work -- which includes a vending machine that sells a mock lethal pathogen and tracks users' identities -- from his role as a graduate student at Berkeley's computer science department to maintain his artistic autonomy.
Ray Thomas, on the other hand, is firmly in the anti-tech camp. A spokesman for RTMark, a kind of cyberguerrilla group known for lampooning politicians and making mischief for corporations, Mr. Thomas pointed to escalating rents as a death knell for art. "Silicon Valley has basically destroyed the art scene in the Bay Area by bringing in so much money and so many people," he said.
Many of his artist friends are moving to cities like Los Angeles, where rents are lower. "It's basically so demoralizing, people don't even have energy to make art about it," Mr. Thomas said.
In a few cases, technology companies are looking to artists for new ideas that could lead to the development of new technology. Corporate research centers like the Interval Research Corporation and the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center are financing artists in residence. Michael Naimark, an artist at Interval, said: "It's a funny situation right now, because there really isn't an N.E.A. to support experimental work, and there's so much money and activity in high technology. The question is, how do artists fit in? Nobody really has the answer."
They do appear to fit in better in the Bay Area than down the road in Silicon Valley itself, which is generally acknowledged as not having much of an art scene (although a foundation for art and technology in the Valley is in the works). When asked about art in Silicon Valley, John Weber, a curator at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, said: "In Silicon Valley? They work. That's all they do. When they get interested in art, they move."

Sites Remember the Irish Potato Famine

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POLLAK 

 BODY:
IN May 1997, at a ceremony in Cork, Ireland, commemorating those who suffered and died in the great Irish famine, which began in 1845, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain said: "That one million people should have died in what was then part of the richest and most powerful nation in the world is something that still causes pain as we reflect on it today. Those who governed in London at the time failed their people through standing by while a crop failure turned into a massive human tragedy. We must not forget such a dreadful event."
In the last few years, as Irish movies, dance, books and plays have enjoyed a surge of popularity in the United States, a number of Web sites have emerged to ensure that the famine, which Mr. Blair called "a defining event in the history of Ireland and of Britain," will not be forgotten. 
 Perhaps the most thorough treatment is a 117-page curriculum guide for teachers sponsored by the New Jersey Commission on Holocaust Education. It is available for downloading at www.nde.state.ne.us/SS /irish_famine.html, thanks to an Irish education coalition that persuaded the Nebraska Department of Education to put it online. The site is also linked or listed online by the education departments of Illinois, Massachusetts, Idaho and Colorado.
It was prepared by James V. Mullin of Moorestown, N.J., a former teacher and law librarian. In 1995, he began putting together a synopsis on the famine for the Holocaust Commission, which was assembling similar guides on the persecutions and mass deaths of Cambodians, Armenians, American Indians and African slaves. The online curriculum is free. (Another resource site about the famine is at www.people.Virginia .EDU/eas5e/Irish/biblio.html.)
Mr. Mullin, who was educated in parochial schools, said, "I was taught basically that the Irish only wanted to grow potatoes because they loved them so much, and then when the potato crop died, the Irish couldn't think of anything else to eat." He agreed with the historians he consulted that the famine could not be understood apart from British colonial misrule in Ireland.
But it was odd how little teaching existed about the famine and the policies that led to it and worsened it, he said. Jonathan Swift's "Modest Proposal," about eating Irish babies to reduce the surplus population, is routinely taught in English literature courses as a supreme example of irony, he noted, but it is less often taught in English history classes, where it would acquire a needed context.
The heavily footnoted and attributed guide takes Ireland from Neolithic times through the Viking and Norman invasions and into the era of colonial domination, British plantations and the absentee landlord system, laissez-faire economics, the poorhouses, the relief efforts and the anti-relief efforts, and the emigration in what were called coffin ships.
"Between 1845 and 1850, more than a million Irish people starved to death while massive quantities of food were being exported from their country," it begins.
The guide covers the English penal and administrative laws that reduced the native Irish to second-class citizens. A section on racism depicts some of the cartoons that helped foster Irish stereotypes. (The publication of Darwin's "On the Origin of the Species" in 1859 was soon followed by an upsurge in caricatures of Irishmen as monkeys.)
There are horrific depictions of beggars, of skeletal children, of a man staggering to the graveyard carrying his dead wife. Equally horrific are the quotes from Parliament on the folly of upsetting "natural law" by aiding the starving, and the economic wisdom of encouraging their eviction (in the dead of winter) and their emigration (in ships with mortality rates of more than 50 percent).
There is a discussion of genocide, and historians and political theorists are quoted on the differences between the planned extermination of a people or a culture and the prejudice and culpable neglect that produce the same result.
The curriculum has been revised to add a section on poetry of the famine and to remove a few lines that might unfairly characterize Britain today. But Mr. Mullin said he was disappointed at how many people assumed, wrongly, that the curriculum was anti-British or an Irish nationalist project.
"People are always saying we're comparing it to the Holocaust when we've never done that, and we never will do that," he said. "There is a passive genocide. You can allow people to die." Comparisons with famines in Ukraine, in China under the Great Leap Forward or among the Indians are always inexact, he said, "but the comparisons have to be made if we're going to learn anything."

HEADLINE: Site Sees a Sure Thing In Basketball Contest

BYLINE: By JOEL BRINKLEY 

 BODY:
IT seems like an audacious gamble for a small dot-com that lost more than $6 million last year.
Sandbox.com, one of the several thousand Internet start-ups in the Washington area scrabbling for attention and wealth, is putting on a rich sweepstakes based on the men's college basketball tournament that begins today, promising to pay $10 million to anyone who correctly chooses the winners of all 63 games. 
 So far about 600,000 contestants have filled out the brackets online, and Sandbox's 30-year-old president, Lawrence M. Cotter, said he expected the total to approach one million contestants before the contest, called It's Madness, closes at noon today.
But as with so many things in the new online economy, the risks for Mr. Cotter and his company are illusory. First, it is highly unlikely that anyone will win. Statisticians put the odds of selecting all 63 winners at something in the neighborhood of eight or nine quintillion (a quintillion has 18 zeros).
But then, most basketball fans think that they bring some knowledge and skill to the selections.
"So I think the odds are really in the neighborhood of one in five billion," Mr. Cotter said, "meaning that the chances are about 1 in 600 that a Sandbox member will win."
But a single upset in the tournament can cause turmoil.
Last year, when Sandbox offered a mere $1 million prize, every one of the 160,000 contestants was shut out in the very first round, after the highly ranked University of North Carolina lost to Weber State, a Cinderella team, by one point in the first game -- which almost nobody predicted. This year, another Web site, Predict It (sports .predictit.com), is offering a similar contest with a $1 million prize.
Mr. Cotter said he hoped that his contest would last longer this year. After all, the game for Sandbox.com is to gain national attention as well as new members for its online gaming business.
And at this point he has nothing to lose because if someone does win, Sandbox.com doesn't have to come up with the $10 million.
The company bought "hole in one" insurance, so named for the country-club practice of parking a Cadillac Coupe DeVille on the golf course, next to the 18th hole, and promising to give it to the member who can sink a hole in one.
An insurance examiner figured the odds for Sandbox.com's contest and assessed a fee of about 25 cents per player, or just $250,000 if one million people play.
Worried that the contest and resulting attention will shut down quickly again this year, Sandbox is also giving away other prizes, like a car and entertainment centers, for people who pick lots of game winners, if not all of them. The top scorer wins a Pontiac, donated by another Web site, AutoMall.com.
Sandbox also recruited several paying "sponsors," or advertisers, for the contest. The lead sponsor, whose banner advertisement appears at the top of the contest Web page, is another Internet start-up, PhoneFree.com.
Jan Horsfall, the company's president, said, "We are extremely stoked to be part of such great fun."
What's more, Sandbox is earning money from the entrants. Registration is free, but Sandbox presents about a dozen special offers -- trial magazine subscriptions, memberships at other Web sites -- on the registration page.
So many people are taking them up on the offers that on average, Sandbox is getting $3.50 in commissions and other fees as a result of each registration, the company said.
With all that, "everyone's a winner," Mr. Cotter said with a smile.
The contest almost did not get off the ground. The company ordered new server capacity to handle the surge in visitors to the site, but after weeks of promising, the contractor had not delivered by last Friday.
The National Collegiate Athletic Association was to post the game brackets on Sunday evening, and that is when Sandbox needed to have its contest up and running.
"We called all around the area, desparately looking for bandwidth," Mr. Cotter said. Finally a local company stepped in to help, and the higher-capacity servers were in place just in time on Sunday evening.
"We'd love to have someone win so we could march him around the country with a big $10 million check," Mr. Cotter said.
After a moment of thought, he added with a grin: "That's the second-best thing that could happen. The first-best thing would be for a hacker to shut down our site for two hours in the middle of the contest, and we'd be on the front pages of all the papers."
So far, a windfall like that has not arrived, so the company is already thinking about next year's contest.
Bill Carey, Sandbox's executive vice president, has said the company is thinking of offering $64 million in 2001. After all, what's to lose?

HEADLINE: MAKING BOOKS;
Black Reviews, Still a Secret

BYLINE: By Martin Arnold 

 BODY:
It matters that few people in book publishing seem aware of the existence of an ambitious, glossy bimonthly magazine devoted entirely to black literary culture, to books by or about blacks and to news about the few black people who work in publishing. The magazine, Black Issues Book Review, is a secret that doesn't want to be kept, and it matters that it is largely unknown in the industry because more books written by black authors are being published than ever before. Black Issues is trying, with some success, to reach African-Americans, particularly but not exclusively those on the high end socially and economically. In short, regular book customers.
To mainstream publishing, blacks are somewhat like a very welcome weekend guest that the host doesn't quite know how to entertain. Thus, for instance, Susan McHenry, editor of Black Issues, said that although the magazine is filled with book reviews, it still has difficulty getting on publishers' lists to receive galleys of new black books. It's not that publishers want to withhold them; it's just that they don't think black. Without such galleys, there can be no reviews, and without reviews no influence for the publication and no sales for the book. 
 Among other examples: in some book stores, the works of Toni Morrison are found on the racks identified as African-American literature, not general literature, where one would expect to find a Nobel laureate. (Sometimes, but not always, they are cross-indexed.) And there remains that old question: Where are the black editors? The answer is not that publishers don't want them but rather that they don't know how to attract them. This is not about prejudice as much as it is about a meandering lack of urgency.
Besides the growing number of books by and about blacks, in recent years black readers' groups have popped up all over. Publishers, with some exceptions, have been slow to respond to this expanding constituency. Doubleday Direct, the book club division of Bertelsmann, has Black Expressions, a club devoted to books by and about blacks, with its own online version, and Ballantine has its One World imprint, which publishes black writers. HarperCollins owns Amistad Press, devoted to work by and about African-Americans.
Still, there's a divide between what's being published and what's being publicized about black literature; to cross that divide there are black literary magazines, the newest among them Black Issues. Its latest issue, March-April 2000, celebrates the magazine's first anniversary. There are other magazines, like The Quarterly Black Review, founded in 1993, and Mosaic Literary Magazine, a quarterly founded two years ago as a showcase for new black literary writers.
Black Issues is a slick magazine, ambitious in scope, with crisp writing and quality production values. Its format is slightly larger than a news weekly, and it is divided into sections about literary subjects (the latest issue features poetry and the cover line is "Rap Is Poetry: Hip-Hop's Poet Ambassadors") and the business of book publishing. Between them are scattered 8 fiction reviews, 11 nonfiction reviews, 6 reviews of books of poetry and the usual magazine tchotchkes: shorts about deals, today's top 10 poetry CD's, a feature called Bookbytes etc.
Rone Shavers, the managing editor, said the magazine hoped to attract bookstores, libraries, agents, book publicists and art designers, "but the main mission is reaching regular book readers."
Ms. McHenry said: "There's no one place where someone can go and find out what's in the bookstores and libraries about people of African descent. A major national review may review a handful of black books a year. We do more than that in our latest issue."
"We want to have a national forum for the growing black book audience," she continued. "There's a community of lovers of black literature who are interested in contemporary black writers."
Black Issues was founded by a cultural entrepreneur, William E. Cox, who had started two other publications, Black Issues in Higher Education and Community College Week, a newspaper. Both are bimonthly.
"We ran book reviews in the higher education magazine," he said, "and we started to receive so many unsolicited book reviews back from readers there was no way we could publish them. First we did a special report twice a year. But there was this tremendous interest in books, we found, based on our feedback. Why starve an audience out there?"
The first issue of the book review was sent to colleges and universities. "But I wanted to cut across all areas, whether high school graduate or not, whether college graduate or not," Mr. Cox said. "I wanted a broad-based audience, yet I wanted to attack the high end economically and socially."
The magazine sells 40,000 copies of each issue, through subscriptions and newsstands, which includes bookstores, most but not all of which are black. The Borders chain is its largest advertiser and major supporter, and has been from the start. The magazine is advertising-driven, and Mr. Cox hopes to start making money on it in two years. Black Issues in Education also sells 40,000 copies each issue, but it has much more advertising and is a moneymaker, Mr. Cox said.
The latest issue of the book review has 74 pages, about its average size. Borders has its usual full-page ad inside the front cover and a second one for its Web site. Absolut vodka has the back cover. In between are but a few book publishing ads. Of the mainstream publishers, Doubleday has a full-page ad, and Penguin Putnam has an ad. There are also ads from Arabesque, Warner Aspect and the University of Indiana Press.
Book publishers, who often moan about their sales, should certainly be out there supporting anything that moves the product, which makes the ghostly absence of major publishing house ads all that more surprising.

HEADLINE: Growth in Industrial Sector Was Less Robust in February

BYLINE: Reuters 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15

 BODY:
Industrial production grew more slowly than expected in February after surging in January, as carmakers scaled back their output of new cars and trucks, the Federal Reserve said today.
Production by the nation's factories, mines and utilities advanced 0.3 percent last month after a revised 1.1 percent jump in January, which was the strongest monthly increase in one and a half years. Wall Street economists had forecast a gain of 0.5 percent for last month. 
 Analysts said the report still showed that the industrial sector had ample momentum that would keep growth robust in the first quarter.
They said the report would play little part in the meeting Tuesday when Federal Reserve policy makers are widely expected to raise official interest rate targets again in an effort to curb booming consumer demand.
Businesses operated at 81.7 percent of their maximum capacity in February, the same as in January. Though it remained near a two-year high, the rate was below 85 percent, which might fan concern about production bottlenecks.
"The broader picture is that capacity utilization is a key to the inflation picture, and that figure continues to move higher," said Michael Niemira, an economist with Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi Ltd. in New York.
"With labor pressures and energy prices moving up, it keeps alive the risk of higher inflation ahead," he added.
February registered the 14th consecutive monthly increase in industrial output, underlining the manufacturing sector's steady revival from a bout of weakness in 1998 caused by an Asian financial crisis. It also highlighted the sector's role in fostering the steady economic growth since the last recession ended in March 1991. The economy entered a record 108th month of unbroken growth in March.
Manufacturing raised its production by 0.3 percent last month after a rise of 1 percent in January. The Fed said motor vehicle producers slowed the rate at which they assembled new cars and trucks to 12.9 million a year from the January rate of 13.3 million.
Utility companies raised production a moderate 0.7 percent in February after a 2.7 percent jump in January, as milder weather placed less strain on electricity and natural gas producers. But mining companies reduced their production last month by 0.7 percent, reversing January's 0.6 percent gain.
A separate report on Tuesday from the Commerce Department showed businesses increased their inventories for the 13th consecutive month in January as strong sales to retailers, manufacturers and wholesalers left supplies at their lowest level on record.
The Commerce Department said total inventories rose 0.5 percent in January to a seasonally adjusted $1.150 trillion, matching the gain of 0.5 percent recorded in December.
The inventory-to-sales ratio, which measures how long it would take to fully deplete inventories at the current sales pace, fell to a record low of 1.31 months in January in a reflection of robust consumer demand.
In another report, the United States current account deficit, the broadest measure of foreign trade, widened to a record in the fourth quarter as imports outpaced exports, topping a year in which the deficit surged 53.7 percent.
The Commerce Department said the deficit swelled 12 percent, to $99.78 billion, in the fourth quarter, surpassing the record set in the third quarter, which was revised slightly lower to $89.09 billion.
The deficit on goods also hit a new record of $96.22 billion, up from $91.94 billion in the previous quarter, indicating that Americans' appetite for foreign products like cars and electronics remains insatiable.
For the complete year, the deficit hit a record $338.92 billion, up 53.7 percent from $220.56 billion for 1998.

HEADLINE: Paul Rudolph Jolles, Envoy Of the Atomic Age, Dies at 80

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS 

 BODY:
Paul Rudolph Jolles, a Swiss diplomat who played a key role in promoting the peaceful use of atomic energy through the International Atomic Energy Agency in Vienna and later became chairman of Nestle, the Swiss food-products group, died on March 11 in Bern. He was 80.
At the end of his life, Mr. Jolles had the unusual experience of seeing the fruits of his earliest diplomatic labor blow up into a major political storm when the United States forced Switzerland's banks to return unclaimed Holocaust-era assets to descendants of the victims of Nazism. 
 In 1946, on his first foreign posting in Washington, Mr. Jolles served as secretary to the chief of the Swiss delegation that negotiated the so-called Washington Accord, in which the Swiss agreed to turn over much of the Nazi gold and other German assets Switzerland had amassed in its vaults.
The agreement was supposed to have settled Switzerland's postwar obligations toward the victorious Allies for good.
In a 1997 interview with the Swiss-German newspaper Der Bund, Mr. Jolles strongly defended Switzerland's economic conduct during the war, saying: "Switzerland never enriched itself, it simply traded according to market criteria. During the war Switzerland's national income increased only marginally -- by less than 1 percent a year."
Mr. Jolles had a lifelong passion for contemporary art and acquired a sizable personal collection. As chairman of Nestle from 1984 to 1990, he was particularly proud of his success in creating the Nestle Art Foundation, which has become a major force on the Swiss artistic scene.
After holding a number of positions in the Swiss administration, mainly concerned with foreign economic relations, Mr. Jolles became deeply involved in President Eisenhower's Atoms for Peace initiative, begun in December 1953. He served in 1957 as executive secretary of the preparatory commission planning the International Atomic Energy Agency.
After the creation of the agency later that year, Mr. Jolles was appointed a deputy directors general, with responsibility for administration, by the first director general, W. Sterling Cole, a former New York State Republican Congressman who had served as chairman of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy. The three other deputies came from France, the Soviet Union and Britain. Mr. Jolly left the atomic energy agency in 1961, returning to the Swiss administration.
"It was an important job and he did it well," said Sir Brian Urquhart, a former United Nations under secretary general for special political affairs, who worked with him on setting up the agency.
Born in Bern on Dec. 25, 1919, Mr. Jolles studied law at the Universities of Bern and Lausanne and in 1943 obtained a doctorate in political science at Harvard University.
In 1956 he married the former Erna Ryffel. He is survived by his wife, two sons and a daughter.

HEADLINE: The Tragedy of Myanmar

 BODY:
Few governments warrant isolation more than Myanmar's military junta, one of the most brutal and repressive regimes in the world. But the cruelty of Myanmar, formerly Burma, is increasingly a regional problem that threatens to destabilize its Southeast Asian neighbors with refugees, narcotics and now AIDS. Unfortunately, Myanmar has faded from attention at a time when the need for concerted action has never been greater.
The latest disturbing news is that Myanmar's booming heroin trade is contributing to the spread of AIDS in nearby countries, notably India, China and Vietnam. Myanmar is the world's second-largest source of opium and heroin, after Afghanistan. It also has its own exploding epidemics of drug use and AIDS. 
 The courageous opposition leader and 1991 Nobel peace laureate, Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, an advocate of nonviolent resistance, remains under strict government control in the capital, Yangon, formerly called Rangoon. The government continues with a campaign of harassment and imprisonment of her party, the National League for Democracy, which won 80 percent of the parliamentary seats in a 1990 election that the junta then annulled. In recent years South Korea, the Philippines and Thailand have replaced authoritarian regimes with fledgling democracies. Now Indonesia has done the same. The changes present a fresh opening for action on Myanmar, but the world has been slow to seize it. The United Nations secretary general, Kofi Annan, has yet to appoint a new special envoy for Myanmar to coordinate international efforts to bring pressure on the junta.
The White House took the lead in isolating Myanmar, imposing sanctions on new investment there in 1997. But the problem has not been high on Washington's agenda for many months. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which includes Myanmar, will meet in July, and the Group of Eight leading industrial nations will gather in Japan the same month. Tokyo continues to do business with Myanmar's leaders. Washington should use the occasion of this summer's meetings to persuade its democratic friends in the region to shun Myanmar and make clear that normal trade and diplomatic relations cannot be sustained as long as the government abuses its people.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: BONDS;
Treasuries Riseon Hopes Of Slowdown

BYLINE: By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices rose yesterday, as declines in the Nasdaq composite index fueled speculation that the economy might slow and prompted some investors to buy fixed-income securities.
Thirty-year Treasuries were also helped to a third consecutive day of gains, as Wall Street firms and investors prepared for a second round of Treasury Department bond buybacks today and as the price of crude oil dropped 3 percent. That drop reduced concern about faster inflation, analysts said. 
 There is "some shift out of equity investments into fixed income," said Zane Brown, who has loaded up on high-yield and municipal bonds for the $12 billion he oversees at Lord, Abbett & Company. A sustained drop in "the Nasdaq could cause some people to reassess expectations for stocks in general."
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond rose 8/32 , to 10215/32 . The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 6.07 percent from 6.09 percent Tuesday.
In afternoon trading, Treasury bonds eased a bit as the Dow Jones industrial average surged 3.3 percent and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 2.6 percent.
Fed policy makers have cited gains in stocks as a pillar of the booming economy. Further losses in stocks, especially the Nasdaq index, which is up 12.6 percent this year and rose 86 percent in 1999, may cap consumer spending and limit interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve, investors said.
"A weak stock market is one harbinger of a softer economy," said Hal Woolley, who helps invest $5 billion in fixed income at Bessemer Trust Company. It's one change that "will make the Fed stop raising rates."

HEADLINE: Hylan G. Lewis, 88, Student of the Urban Poor

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE 

 BODY:
Hylan Garnet Lewis, a sociologist and pioneer in the field of community studies who was active in public life and taught in New York for years, died on March 8 at a hospital in Versailles, France. He was 88, lived on Manhattan's Upper West Side and had been visiting France.
The death of Dr. Lewis, who was retired, was announced on Tuesday by the City University of New York Graduate Center, where he was a professor of sociology for two decades, beginning in 1977. 
 "Professor Lewis, in his research, teaching and leadership in public affairs, was a bright beacon that lit, and in a major way, helped to guide more than a half-century of American race relations," said Setsuko Matsunaga Nishi, a retired professor of sociology at Brooklyn College and the Graduate Center.
Dr. Lewis's 1955 book "Blackways of Kent" is a study of a black community in the industrializing South. It has been called an exemplary early product of community studies, which examines the role of factors like race, job and economic status and family in joining people together.
He went on to direct, from 1959 to 1964, a child-rearing study carried out by the Health and Welfare Council in Washington. A key finding of the study was that poor black mothers in Washington had aspirations of success for their children that were just as high as those of all middle-class mothers. But the study found that the poor black mothers also had a realistic understanding of the obstacles -- like racial prejudice, poverty and poor schools -- that their children would face.
These findings were important and influential, because it had been widely thought at the time that these children had not been succeeding in life because their families had not set high goals.
Later, Dr. Lewis held posts in New York in which he analyzed, and sought remedies for, the problems of the poor and unemployed. He also studied discrimination against members of minorities in corporate employment, foster care and schools.
He was a senior associate at Kenneth B. Clark & Associates, a consulting firm led by Dr. Clark, the noted psychologist and race-relations expert, which advised corporations, schools and other clients about racial integration.
After teaching at Howard University and in the South, Dr. Lewis was on the faculty of Brooklyn College from 1967 to 1977 and while teaching at the Graduate Center he also taught at Queens College from 1990 to 1992.
He was born in Washington, received a bachelor's degree in 1932 from Virginia Union University in Richmond, Va., and his doctorate in sociology in 1951 from the University of Chicago.
His 1935 marriage to Leighla Whipper ended in divorce.
He is survived by his companion, Francoise Burgess; his wife, the former Audrey Carter, from whom he had been separated for 26 years; a daughter, Carole Ione of Kingston, N.Y.; a son, Guy, of Yreka, Calif.; three grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren and two sisters, Kathryn Garner and Elsie Lewis, both of Washington.

HEADLINE: $500 Million Resort Planned on Concord Site in Catskills

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
In the first major project since the bungalow colonies and hotels in the borscht belt fell on hard times 30 years ago, a developer plans to demolish the legendary Concord Hotel in the Catskills and build a $500 million resort, with a hotel and conference center, golf village, spa ranch, entertainment center and wilderness area.
Louis R. Cappelli, a Westchester developer who bought the Concord property on Kiamesha Lake a year ago, said he planned to begin construction by Labor Day on property of more than 1,600 acres -- twice the size of Central Park. He said that the complex, 90 miles northwest of New York City, would be a year-round attraction in an area where most of the old hotels have crumbled and many people work two and three jobs to make ends meet. 
 Economic pied pipers have appeared before in the Catskill Mountains with fanciful revival plans that quickly evaporated, but local political leaders have embraced Mr. Cappelli's proposal as a substantive development that could bring new life to the area.
"We're very excited to have him here," said Rusty Pomeroy, chairman of the Sullivan County Legislature. "Once in a while you get a project that can reposition the area all by itself. If he's able to do it, it would change the way people perceive Sullivan County. We're not the borscht belt anymore. We're not a dying, depressed county."
Mr. Cappelli presented his plans yesterday in Monticello a day after Gov. George E. Pataki seemed to dash longstanding hopes for another project, an Indian-run casino at the Monticello Raceway. Governor Pataki has long said that casinos would provide a much-needed boost for former resort areas like Monticello. But on Tuesday, he introduced a bill that would require the State Legislature to approve any Indian gambling initiative, which proponents say is unlikely to happen.
In recent months, Mr. Pataki had come under attack by casino operators from Atlantic City and anti-gambling groups in New York who opposed a planned $500 million casino in Monticello. Some unions have also criticized Indian-run casinos, which are not bound by labor or civil rights laws.
"In my opinion, the governor is bailing out because he has national aspirations," said Mr. Pomeroy, who had supported the casino. "He acceded to a campaign against him by the Atlantic City gaming interests. If this goes to the Legislature, the people speculating on a casino can pack it in. There's too much Donald Trump influence there."
The Federal Bureau of Indian Affairs and Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt are nearing a decision on the proposed casino, which would be owned by the St. Regis Mohawk tribe. The project also needs state approval.
Mr. Cappelli said his plans were not dependent on the casino, which had touched off a land boom in Sullivan County in the last two years. He said the Concord is only 90 minutes northwest of New York City and within a four-hour drive of 55 million people. The resort, he said, should attract conventions looking for an 1,100-room hotel in a rural setting, as well as families looking for a weekend getaway.
"It's going to be a world-class destination resort in one of the most beautiful and easily accessible areas in the nation," Mr. Cappelli said. "It's going to be like nothing else you've ever seen. I think it will also attract all those kids who used to enjoy the Catskills and are now grown up and looking for places to go."
Mr. Cappelli, and his partner, Reckson Strategic Venture Partners, bought the Concord and Grossinger's, perhaps the most famous of the old Catskill resorts, last year in bankruptcy court. Both properties were in disrepair, although the Monster golf course at the Concord, one of the longest in the country, and the Grossinger's golf course have remained open.
Mr. Cappelli has since hired an architect and hotel consultants to develop what he calls the Concord Resorts at Kiamesha Lake. He said Salomon Smith Barney, the investment bank, would offer $150 million in bonds on June 15 to finance the first of two phases.
In the first phase, Mr. Cappelli, who has built office buildings and retail complexes in Westchester, on Long Island and in Connecticut, said he would build the convention center, time-share apartments, the golf village and the spa ranch. The second, $200 million phase would include rental housing, an alpine village and a retail and entertainment complex. An internal tram system would transport visitors across the hilly property and around the golf courses at the center of the property.
The Concord was the largest of 500 hotels and scores of bungalow colonies that once dotted the wooded landscape of Sullivan County, providing a respite for vacationing, mostly Jewish, New Yorkers and a stage for entertainers like Milton Berle and Danny Kaye.
The Catskills evoke memories captured in books and movies like "A Walk on the Moon," and "Dirty Dancing." But with the advent of inexpensive air fares in the 1970's and competition from Europe and Florida, the area fell into decline. Many of the hotels and bungalows were abandoned and eventually demolished, leaving thousands of residents unemployed.
Local residents have heard promises of a revival for decades. "Most people are hopeful but skeptical," said John Conway, the county historian. "We've seen a lot of proposals for resurrecting these hotels come and go, but very few have been carried out. What is encouraging about Cappelli is that this man comes with visible means of support and a willingness to start from scratch."
There have been unsuccessful efforts to build casinos for almost 40 years. A recession cut short the boom in vacation homes in the late 1980's. Joshua Muss, a developer who bought land near Grossinger's, is still waiting to build. Soung Kiy Min bought Grossinger's in 1993 with plans for a redevelopment, only to see it sink back into bankruptcy court.
More recently, several developers bought a number of old resort properties in anticipation, at least in part, that the Mohawk casino would soon open. But since then, David Flaum, a developer from Rochester, has done nothing with the 336-acre Shawanga Lodge property he bought in nearby Wurtsboro last year. And developers are proceeding very slowly at the old Laurels resort on Sackett Lake.
Crescent Heights Investments, however, hopes to break ground in a month or two on a hotel and conference center and a golf community on an 800-acre parcel in Wurtsboro Hills. And Mr. Cappelli said he wants to move quickly.
"The Concord name is synonymous with Sullivan County," said Jonathan Drapkin, the county manager. "If Cappelli can rebuild the glory of that name, I think it'll mean a lot. It can have an impact well beyond the hotel property."

Thai Bankruptcy Decision Seen as a Victory for Creditors

BYLINE: By WAYNE ARNOLD 

DATELINE: JAKARTA, Indonesia, March 15

 BODY:
In a landmark decision watched closely throughout Southeast Asia, Thailand's fledgling bankruptcy court declared Thai Petrochemical Industry, that country's largest corporate debtor, insolvent today.
Creditors regarded the decision as an important victory that could help them start to recover billions of dollars in unpaid loans left from the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis. 
 Thailand's Central Bankruptcy Court ruled that Thai Petrochemical, which defaulted on $3.5 billion in debt in 1997, had liabilities exceeding its assets and ordered the company to submit to court-supervised restructuring.
Thai Petrochemical's creditors, which include the International Finance Corporation, which is part of the World Bank, and the United States Export-Import Bank, filed court papers to have the company declared insolvent last month after more than two years of talks on how to get the company to begin repaying its debts broke down.
Thai Petrochemical's story is one that is being repeated in various forms around Southeast Asia, reflecting efforts to clean up the mess left by the financial crisis. Banks and other creditors have resorted to legal proceedings to uproot the entrenched family interests that continue to dominate much of the region's economy. In Indonesia, for example, efforts to sell assets repossessed by the government have been delayed by legal wrangling over the role still played by former owners connected to the fallen former President Suharto.
Creditors of Thai Petrochemical did not get everything they wanted. The bankruptcy court rejected their request to replace Thai Petrochemical's family-led management immediately, saying a meeting of all creditors and management must take place first. That means there could be more negotiations between the creditors and Prachai Leophairatana, Thai Petrochemical's founder and chief executive.
But Thai officials and analysts still called the ruling a victory in efforts by creditors to force the most stubborn debtors to negotiate in good faith.
"It's a rather good outcome for creditors," said Anthony J. Norman, managing director of Effective Planners Ltd., a unit of Ferrier Hodgson Ltd., the financial advisory firm that the creditor committee had put forward to take over management of Thai Petrochemical. Creditors were satisfied with the decision, Mr. Norman said, shrugging off the possible delay posed by further negotiations. "What does a few weeks matter when you've been waiting 30 months?"
Thai Petrochemical owes so much money that the successful restructuring of its debt would eliminate almost 7 percent of Thailand's outstanding bad loans. Foremost among the beneficiaries would be Bangkok Bank, Thailand's largest bank, which extended $600 million in credit to Thai Petrochemical and is the company's single largest lender.
Financial markets, which had rallied Tuesday in expectation of a ruling favorable to creditors, fell back on the news, with the benchmark index in Thailand falling 3.5 percent. Thailand's currency, the baht, was little changed against the dollar.
The ruling today appeared to stop short of setting what many bankers and lawyers had hoped would be a legal precedent on interpreting insolvency. Current Thai law, amended in 1998 and 1999 to give more power to lenders, defines insolvency as an excess of liabilities over assets, but it fails to include situations in which an otherwise healthy company is unable or unwilling to repay its debts. A report made in January by the Asian Development Bank, the International Finance Corporation and the World Bank to Thai officials identified this loophole as one of several shortcomings in the law.
The Thai bankruptcy court, established only nine months ago as a separate entity to expedite cases like this one, appeared to rely instead on technicalities in deciding in the creditors' favor. It rejected Thai Petrochemical's defense partly because the company's financial adviser who had testified about its debt problems was deemed by the court to be unqualified.
It remains unclear how long it would take to convene a meeting of Thai Petrochemical's nearly 150 creditors, which could give Mr. Prachai a new, if diminished, chance to retain control of the company he and his family founded in 1978. Thai Petrochemical officials did not return phone calls seeking a reaction to the court's decision.
Company officials had said they would resign if they lost the case, but there was no immediate sign that they would abide by that statement. Last week, the company appealed to nationalist sentiments, issuing a statement to the Thai stock exchange that accused creditors of trying to destroy the company and of planning to lay off most of its 20,000 employees.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
When Greenspan speaks and the stock market doesn't listen, the loss of credibility is dangerous.

BYLINE: By Jeff Madrick; This column appears here every Thursday. Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine and adjunct professor of social sciences at Cooper Union. Four economic analysts -- Mr. Madrick, Virginia Postrel, Alan B. Krueger and J. Bradford DeLong -- rotate as contributors.

 BODY:
ALAN GREENSPAN is no longer taken as seriously on Wall Street as he once was. Why else did the strong warnings he made about the lofty levels of stock prices last month go unheeded by so many? His basic message was right: over-speculation can damage the economy. But while the Dow Jones industrials fell on his comments, if only moderately, investors defiantly sent the all-important Nasdaq to record highs.
Some still believe that the Nasdaq rose because the technology stocks that dominate it are relatively immune from any interest rate increases Mr. Greenspan might impose. But that's wishful thinking. The new economy is still dependent on the much larger old one. After all, what is going to be sold on the Internet? Even though Nasdaq gave plenty back this week, it is above the level that provoked Mr. Greenspan to issue his warnings. For that matter, the Dow industrial average, after yesterday's rise, made up all but a couple of percentage points of the ground it had lost. 
 For all his bluntness, Mr. Greenspan was simply not able to deflate stock portfolios with his warnings. The nation's mutual funds, for example, were so top-heavy with the high-technology Nasdaq leaders that they just kept rising in value. "Despite the bifurcation in the market, most investors are still up this year," says Michael Lipper, who monitors the funds. To some on Wall Street, Mr. Greenspan is becoming the chairman who talks loudly but carries a little stick.
The issue is moral hazard, a technical term that means investors take too much risk because they know that if all goes wrong, they will be protected by the central bank from having to absorb severe losses. Such aggressive investing can drive financial prices to insupportable levels.
Moral hazard is not the only factor that pushes asset prices to irrational heights -- greed has no small part. But many believe it contributed significantly to the Asian financial crisis of 1997. The bailouts came in the form of giant emergency loans.
To many Americans, moral hazard is something that only happens elsewhere. But consider our own bailouts. In 1987, Mr. Greenspan admirably engineered an infusion of money worldwide after the market crash. Stock prices came back and major economies avoided recession. In 1997, he supplied liquidity again to offset the escalating Asian financial crisis. Again, the West averted disaster.
Mr. Greenspan even injected funds late last year to forestall problems that some feared would result as computers and other electronic equipment crossed into 2000.
However necessary these were, many in the markets now seem to believe Mr. Greenspan will always save the day. Moreover, there is a suggestion in his public pronouncements that he is not sufficiently sensitive to this. He warns of irrational exuberance, on the one hand, only to present a case, on the other hand, that a new economy can continue to grow rapidly without inflation. Robert J. Shiller, a Yale economist, writes in his new book "Irrational Exuberance" (Princeton University Press) that cheering on investors while warning them not to speculate is no way to maintain credibility.
In his remarks before Congress last month, the Fed chairman cloaked his market concerns in terms of fighting inflation, but my guess is that he was really worried that a stock market flying so much higher than its historical norms is at risk of collapse. Mr. Greenspan knows that any such collapse could result in a recessionary reduction in spending by consumers.
Ultimately more dangerous, a fall in stock prices could induce a run on the United States dollar as foreign investors withdraw money and American investors seek greener pastures abroad. A falling dollar would then push up interest rates and import prices. To control inflation, the Fed might have to tighten further.
The virtuous circle of a high dollar, high stock prices, low inflation and low interest rates could suddenly slip into the vicious circle of a falling dollar, falling stock prices and rising inflation and interest rates. Recession would not be far behind.
Here is my pipe dream. The Fed chairman at last recognizes that he needs two weapons to fight on two fronts. To be sure, this would require Mr. Greenspan to break the self-imposed rules that restrict the Fed to monitoring inflation and economic growth. But some of history's most successful central bankers were at their best when they broke their own rules.
At next Tuesday's Fed policy meeting, Mr. Greenspan should consider raising interest rates no more than a quarter point, as expected, but he should also do the unexpected and raise the 50 percent margin requirement on stock purchases to stanch market speculation. Admittedly, there are plenty of ways around such margin requirements these days, which require investors to put up half the purchase price in cash. But if margin debt, now at record levels, is so meaningless, why are so many people resorting to it?
Raising margin requirements alone would not have much bite, but if margin requirements and interest rates were raised simultaneously, Mr. Greenspan could restore some credibility and send a strong message to the Street.
The Fed should also consider tightening its capital requirements on risky bank loans to big investors. Reducing speculation by restricting credit now would help Mr. Greenspan avoid larger and quite painful rate increases in the future.
The real fear is whether he has waited too long.

HEADLINE: F.T.C. Expected to File Complaints Over Generic Drug Delays

BYLINE: By MELODY PETERSEN 

 BODY:
The Federal Trade Commission is expected to file complaints today contending that four drug companies harmed consumers when they made agreements that delayed the sale of low-cost generic drugs, according to lawyers and executives briefed on the matter.
The expected civil actions will be the first to come from a continuing investigation by the commission into the growing number of deals between companies that make brand-name drugs and competitors that are developing cheaper, generic forms of popular medications. Under the agreements, the brand-name company pays the generic company not to sell the lower-cost drug. As a result, consumers pay hundreds of millions of dollars more than they would if the cheaper drug were available. 
 The Andrx Corporation, a generic drug maker, said yesterday that the commission was expected to file a case against it and Aventis, created last year with the merger of Hoechst A.G. of Germany and Rhone-Poulenc S.A. of France, over a 1997 agreement between Andrx and Hoechst. Under the agreement, Hoechst agreed to pay Andrx $100 million a year if Andrx kept its generic version of Cardizem CD, one of the nation's top-selling heart drugs, off pharmacy shelves. Cardizem had sales of $850 million in 1998, according to IMS Health, a market research firm.
The F.T.C. is also expected to settle charges with Abbott Laboratories and Geneva Pharmaceuticals, a generic drug company owned by Novartis, executives said. The charges result from a deal between the two companies involving Abbott's blood-pressure drug, Hytrin, which had sales of $610 million in 1998. Abbott agreed to pay Geneva millions of dollars a month to not sell its generic version of Hytrin.
Elliot Hahn, president of Andrx, based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., said yesterday that the company's agreement with Aventis did not harm consumers. Instead, Mr. Hahn said, details of the agreement and Aventis's payments helped the financially struggling Andrx get the generic drug on the market faster than would have otherwise been possible.
"We did everything we could to get this product out there," Mr. Hahn said.
A spokeswoman for Aventis also said that the agreement with Andrx did not harm consumers but was solely meant to protect the company's patent.
"We are aware that the commission is expecting to vote on this issue," she said. "We don't yet know the outcome of that vote."
Spokeswomen at Abbott, based in North Chicago, Ill., and Geneva, based in Broomfield, Colo., declined to comment yesterday.
Some of the companies are also facing class-action lawsuits filed by consumers and large purchasers of drugs, including insurance companies and pharmacies. Abbott disclosed in its annual 10-K report this week that Florida's attorney general was also demanding information about its agreement with Geneva and about a similar deal with another drug company, Zenith Laboratories.
The commission is investigating the generic drug deals at a time when many popular drugs are nearing the end of their patent protection. To protect revenues derived from those brand-name drugs, companies often quickly file lawsuits against any competitor that applies to the Food and Drug Administration to sell a generic form. The lawsuits argue that the generic drug company is infringing on the other company's patent.
A growing number of those lawsuits result in the kind of settlements the commission is now investigating.
Mr. Hahn said that Andrx had submitted applications to develop the generic form of 10 different brand-name drugs. So far, he said, Andrx has been sued by the manufacturer of the brand-name drug over nine of those applications. Just by filing the lawsuit, the company with the brand-name drug can often delay the introduction of the generic drug for many months.
"That is the game," Mr. Hahn said.
The commission is expected to file its case involving Aventis and Andrx before an administrative law judge rather than in federal court. The F.T.C. could only press for fines or other financial penalties if it filed the complaints in federal court.
In the case of Abbott and Geneva, the commission is expected to approve a consent order that would not involve financial penalties but would prohibit the companies from entering into similar agreements in the future.

HEADLINE: Ukraine Leader Cancels U.S. Visit Over I.M.F. Complaint

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN with TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15

 BODY:
The prime minister of Ukraine canceled a visit to the United States earlier this week after the Clinton administration told him that he should come only after "cleaning up" his government, which was discovered to have abused a major international loan program.
Ukrainian officials said the prime minister, Viktor Yushchenko, postponed his trip on short notice because of a mining disaster at home, not because of a snub by the president. 
 Mr. Yushchenko, who was confirmed by Parliament as prime minister late last year and was planning to make his first official visit to Washington in that capacity, was told that he would not be able to meet with President Clinton during his stay, a senior administration official said.
The decision to discourage the visit came just before the Treasury Department and the International Monetary Fund revealed that the Ukrainian central bank had made a series of financial transactions designed to create the impression that it had more foreign currency than it did. The fund said that manipulation of exchange reserves was intended at least in part to mislead fund officials into disbursing hundreds of millions of dollars in loans that might otherwise have been withheld.
Mr. Yushchenko headed Ukraine's central bank before becoming prime minister. American officials consider him the leading reformer in a nation that has been rocked by corruption scandals for years. But revelations of mismanagement at the central bank while he served as its leader have undermined the prime minister early in his administration, analysts who follow Ukrainian politics said.
"There was the sense that they should go fix this and then talk about a visit," the senior administration official said. "They clearly have some business to do at home to clean up this problem."
The Washington-based International Monetary Fund, which coordinates its lending programs with the United States, its largest shareholder, said that Ukraine supplied false information about foreign reserves from 1996 to 1998. The country's central bank used nearly $1 billion in hard currency to conduct a series of banking transactions that allowed it to double-count its reserves. The transactions were designed to make it seem as if it was meeting I.M.F.-set goals for managing its economy when it actually might not have met those goals, the fund said this week.
During the period in question, the fund distributed $675 million in loans to Ukraine. Fund officials said today that they had yet to determine exactly how much of that amount would have been withheld if they had had an accurate picture of Ukraine's financial health.
The revelations raise questions about political and economic management in Ukraine, the former Soviet republic that has long been a high priority for the Clinton administration. Until recently, Kiev was the third largest recipient of foreign aid from the United States, after Israel and Egypt -- aid that was intended in part to support democracy and foster capitalism. Ukraine, along with Russia, has also been among the largest recipients of long-term lending from the fund.
The discovery of mismanagement in Ukraine is a blow to the monetary fund at a sensitive time. The fund came under pressure from Congress and the Clinton administration to strengthen its auditing procedures after Russia was found to have misused foreign exchange reserves, possibly including I.M.F. aid, in ways that resemble the problems in Ukraine.
When Congress agreed to devote $18 billion to support the fund in 1998, it set up a commission to investigate ways of streamlining its operations. The so-called Meltzer Commission last week issued a report that, among many recommendations, urged that the fund eliminate the types of long-term lending programs involved in loans to Ukraine.
Lawmakers who vote on United States contributions to the fund have also demanded that the fund do a better job of ensuring that the money it provides is used properly.
"It's going to be important to know who knew what and when at the I.M.F.," said Representative Jim Leach, who is chairman of the House Banking Committee. "There are also very serious questions about how deep the corruption goes in the former Soviet Union -- whether this is just endemic or whether there is still hope for reform."
The fund made a detailed statement about Ukraine's deception in response to questions from several news organizations, fund officials said today. The statement, issued late last night, said that Ukraine's central bank, at its request, hired the private accounting firm of PriceWaterhouseCoopers to audit it accounts. Fund officials said they hoped that the audit would reveal more information about how the currency reserves were inflated, how much money the fund disbursed to Ukraine that it otherwise might have withheld, and whether offshore banking transactions generated profits for Ukrainian officials.
The fund received indications of Ukraine's deception well before it said anything publicly about the matter.
The fund said this week that it had spotted problems with Ukraine's management of its foreign reserves as early as August 1998. In April of last year, legislators in Ukraine's Parliament sent a letter to the I.M.F. raising accusations that the central bank was "round-tripping" foreign reserves through offshore accounts to create a false picture of its total reserves.
The mismanagement, at least so far, has not resulted in any punishment for Ukraine. The nation currently has access to an I.M.F. loan program initiated in September of 1998, though the fund has not recently disbursed money because Ukraine has failed to meet conditions of the loan program.
Questions also have been raised about the role of Credit Suisse First Boston, the New York-based investment banking arm of Swiss financial services giant Credit Suisse Group. Credit Suisse helped transfer about $150 million in central bank funds, some of which might have been provided by the I.M.F., from Ukraine to Cyprus, a popular offshore haven for financial transactions in the former Soviet Union, government investigators said. The information about Credit Suisse's role was first reported by The Financial Times.
The fund said the money involved in that transaction was funneled back into Ukraine from Cyprus, invested in government securities and double-counted for purposes of tallying total foreign reserves.

HEADLINE: New York Planning Crackdown On Excessive Home Loan Fees

BYLINE: By BRUCE LAMBERT 

 BODY:
Regulators in New York State, the nation's largest banking center and an industry pace setter, are devising new rules to crack down on lenders who impose exorbitant fees that force countless homeowners into foreclosure and bankruptcy.
The abuses at issue are the underbelly of the lucrative $280 billion national market in loans for people with limited income or poor credit histories, so-called subprime borrowers. Although such loans charge higher interest rates, they have been a godsend to many people who otherwise might not get financing. 
 But some unscrupulous operators seek out unsophisticated clients, typically elderly or minority homeowners or first-time buyers in poor areas. They talk the victims into refinancing or applying for other loans saddled with excessive interest and fees. The lenders and brokers collect their fees up front. If the borrower falls in arrears, the mortgage holder seizes the house.
With action on the issue apparently stalled in Congress, the New York State Banking Board is flexing its powers to license and oversee mortgage bankers and brokers.
Gov. George E. Pataki, who appoints the board, ordered it to take up the issue last year after an investigation of a major lender, Delta Funding, by Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer. Mr. Pataki was stung by Mr. Spitzer's suggestion that his regulators had gone easy on Delta.
The final regulations are expected to win the board's unanimous support in the next several weeks.
"I hope it will become a model for similar regulation and legislation in other states and on a nationwide basis," said Elizabeth McCaul, the acting superintendent of banks and the board's chairwoman. "We want to end abusive practices, but we don't want to inadvertently cut off access to credit in those communities where we are trying to create more access."
The regulations, drafted in recent months, would impose several new standards for high-cost loans.
*Such loans would be defined as those that charge interest more than eight percentage points above the comparable United States Treasury rate, or up-front fees greater than five points on a loan (a point is 1 percent of the total loan amount). For second mortgages and other home loans, the threshold would be nine percentage points.
*Lenders would be required to consider borrowers' ability to repay and notify them that impartial credit counseling is available.
*Negative amortization (in which the principal grows) would be banned, as would balloon payments before seven years and higher-interest penalties after a default.
*Certain fees and points would be limited to 5 percent of the loan.
*The "packing" of certain insurance and other costs into the loan would be prohibited, as would the "flipping" of loans by refinancing at excessively higher costs, the charging of bogus fees for services not rendered and unfair mandatory arbitration.
While Ms. McCaul said the proposals had broad support from the public and the lending industry, consumer groups say the plan does not go far enough. A joint statement from 70 groups and 12 elected officials last month said that the proposal "leaves serious and glaring loopholes what would allow creative lenders and brokers, in too many instances, to continue their predatory practices as usual."
Those endorsing the statement included AARP; New York Public Interest Research Group; Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, known as Acorn; Harlem Consumer Education Council; and Greater Rochester Community Reinvestment Coalition.
"All eyes are on the New York State Banking Department," said Sarah Ludwig, a leader of a statewide coalition of groups against predatory lending. "The whole country is watching. It's a huge problem, and they've got to get this right. What's clear is they're not really serious about putting the screws to this industry."
Lending-industry leaders, worried that a few disreputable lenders are tainting the rest, say they want the abuses stopped. But they caution that overly stringent rules would hamper legitimate lenders and curtail access to loans for people who need them.
"If there's one bad actor, it puts a black eye on the entire industry," said Robert S. Lotstein, counsel to the National Association of Mortgage Brokers, which has 12,000 members. "We are certainly against predatory lending, but if we need any additional safeguards, they should be narrowly tailored so that we don't throw the baby out with the bath water."
And Stephen A. O'Connor, director for residential financing for the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, which has 3,000 members, said: "New York is a bellwether state. Whatever they do is often copied or emulated."
Other states are also considering action: bills have been filed this year in the Legislatures of California, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri and South Carolina. The industry warns that a state-by-state hodgepodge of 50 systems would hinder lenders and drive up costs. "We would much prefer uniformity to a patchwork," Mr. Lotstein said.
The subprime lending market exploded after Congress changed the banking laws in the 1980's in an effort to help the battered savings and loan industry. The pressure for new regulations stems from a surge of complaints about loan abuses by a number of lenders. One high-profile company, First Alliance, a national company with four offices in New York State, has been under investigation by the federal Justice Department and regulators in seven states, including New York. The New York banking board formulated its proposals before an article in The New York Times and a report on the ABC News program "20/20" yesterday about the practices of First Alliance.
The only state that has enacted rules against predatory lending is North Carolina, under a law passed last year in a compromise reached by consumer groups, some industry groups and government officials. Consumer advocates in New York say that North Carolina's version is a far stricter and better precedent than the proposal pending here.
North Carolina, a major banking state, is home to BankAmerica, First Union and Wachovia. Since the law is still being phased in, it is too early to judge the effect, although Alan S. Hirsch, a deputy to Attorney General Michael F. Easley, a leading proponent, said, "It's very plain to us that all the major lenders can live with this."
But Mr. Lotstein said, "We've had clients who have decided it's just not desirable to do business there anymore, and some have turned in their licenses."
In New York State, consumer groups say, the regulators have already yielded to industry criticism and have ignored the revisions they urged. Ms. Ludwig said the coalition wanted the rules to bar common devices like the financing of all points and fees, penalties for paying off a loan early, the financing of insurance charges paid years in advance, all balloon payments and all mandatory arbitration.
The critics also say that the regulations should require stricter review of a borrower's ability to repay and put greater limits on the frequency of refinancing and on the use of so-called discount points.
"The proposed regulations simply overlook too many victims of predatory lending," said an Acorn member, Gloria Waldron of East New York, Brooklyn. "Almost no cases we've seen would even fall under their definition of high-cost loans."
Abuses take many forms, beginning with deceptive advertising of "free money" and high-pressure sales pitches. In Brooklyn, for example, unethical brokers comb through court records to find homeowners already facing foreclosure. The brokers talk the owners into new loans that save their homes temporarily but sink them deeper into debt as the operators strip out the remaining equity to pay their excessive fees. Some lenders have even preyed on homeowners who have been declared mentally incompetent. Many of the loans start with shady home improvement contractors.
Acorn cited a couple in Port Jefferson Station on Long Island who missed a payment and found their interest rate jacked up, to 24 percent from 14. In Brooklyn, a woman told a lender she had lost her $8,000-a-year job as a home health aide, but it approved a loan anyway, falsely listing her with a $50,000 salary. Another woman learned too late that her $45,000 loan required monthly payments of $500 for 15 years -- $90,000 total -- yet left her owing a balloon payment of $41,000.
The problem is worst in minority neighborhoods that have been neglected by more traditional, lower-cost lenders, critics say. Subprime lenders fill that vacuum. In New York City, the legacy of predatory abuses has been a proliferation of foreclosures that community advocates say is devastating central Brooklyn and southeastern Queens.
Assemblywoman Barbara M. Clark, a Democrat of Queens, has proposed a bill that would create protections beyond the proposed banking board regulations.
"I've seen people losing their homes outright as a result of home improvement or debt consolidation loans," Mrs. Clark said. "They're putting their homes on the line and don't know what they're getting into, with fees and interest that are just off the scale."
Her bill would entitle homeowners to cite an improper loan as a legal defense to prevent foreclosure. It would also cap brokers' fees at 3 percent, require disclosure of finder's fees that lenders pay to home improvement contractors for recruiting borrowers, and hold bankers responsible for the brokers they deal with.
"Somebody needs to do something," said Brenda J. Thompson, a school teacher in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, who said she was victimized by a subprime lender.
After inheriting her mother's brownstone, which had a small mortgage with a monthly payment of $154, she talked to a contractor and lender about renovations. But she was upset when crews tore out walls without her approval or a loan's being issued.
So she went to another lender, who seemed sympathetic and referred her to a new contractor. He was charming but overcharged her with a $70,000 fee, took an additional $6,000 of her money and did incomplete and shabby work, she said.
She was left with a $105,000 loan at 10.9 percent with a $1,002 monthly payment and a balloon balance.
"They did a job on me, all right," Mrs. Johnson said.

Four Drugmakers Expected To Face F.T.C. Complaints
The Federal Trade Commission is expected to file complaints today contending that four drug companies harmed consumers when they made agreements that delayed the sale of low-cost generic drugs, according to lawyers and executives briefed on the matter.
The civil actions would be the first to come from a continuing investigation into deals under which companies that make brand-name drugs pay rivals that are developing cheaper, generic forms not to sell the lower-cost drug. As a result, consumers pay hundreds of millions of dollars more than they would if the cheaper drugs were available. Page C8. 

Bear Stearns Profit Beats Forecast
Bear Stearns posted a 20 percent increase in its first-quarter profit, beating analysts' expectations, as rising investment banking fees offset a slump in bond trading. The securities firm had net income of $278.2 million, or $1.89 a diluted share, compared with $230.7 million, or $1.45 a share, in the period a year earlier. Shares of Bear Stearns rose $1.5625, to $41.50. C8.

King's Popularity Extends to Web
Stephen King's latest novella, "Riding the Bullet," has proved so popular in two days of literary life on the Internet that several online booksellers could not meet the demand from people wanting to download digital copies.

Creditors Cheered by Thai Ruling
Thailand's bankruptcy court declared Thai Petrochemical Industry insolvent. Creditors regarded the decision as an important victory that could help them start to recover billions of dollars in unpaid loans left from the 1997-98 Asian financial crisis. But the court rejected a request to replace Thai Petrochemical's family-led management immediately, saying a meeting of all creditors and management must take place first. That means there could be more negotiations between the creditors and Prachai Leophairatana, the compa ny's founder and chief executive. C4.
 
European Exchanges Revamping
European stock exchanges began to position themselves for a shake-up in the way investors trade. In London, the 298 members of the London Stock Exchange ended almost two centuries of mutual ownership by converting their stakes into tradeable shares. And the Brussels, Paris and Amsterdam stock exchanges are in talks to merge or form an alliance. C4.
 
New Complaint Filed in Auction Case
The top executives of Sotheby's and Christie's, the two archrival auction giants under federal antitrust investigation for collusion, held secret discussions and meetings to fix prices, and Christie's maintained "a highly unusual, concealed separate filing system" to hide the conspiracy from shareholders and regulators, a new complaint contended.

Excerpts From Interview With Bush on Campaign Issues and Election Strategy

BYLINE: By The New York Times 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., March 15

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from an interview today with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, as recorded by The New York Times: 
 Q. What is your reaction to Al Gore's statement that he had asked the Democratic National Committee to refrain from running issue ads financed with soft money?
MR. BUSH: It's kind of a gimmick. He has no credibility, as far as I'm concerned. I don't trust him. I don't trust him. I don't trust him. He needs to stand up in front of the unions, to get all his friends not to run issue ads. I don't trust the man. . . .
Q. Why not call his bluff?
MR. BUSH: I'm running against a man that I believe will say anything to get elected. I believe that. And I am amazed. Last week, it was, we're going to ban all soft money. At the same time, in your newspaper, you reported that President Clinton was out raising soft money and Vice President Gore, the very same day or the next day, in your paper, accurately reported by you all, was getting ready to go raise $35 million and proud of it. So you can understand why I'm somewhat skeptical.
Q. As a politician/competitor, what do you think of him?
MR. BUSH: I believe he'll say anything to get elected, that's what I believe.
Q. If he's willing to say and do anything, how do you not end up having a whole bunch of the time in this campaign consumed by him doing and saying things and you responding?
MR. BUSH: It's very important for me to enunciate clearly where I want to lead the country. In order for me to win, I need to talk about my vision of reform and the ideas that are necessary to achieve reform. There's no question about that. I hope to be able to counterpunch quickly and move directly to where I want to lead America. That's what Americans want to hear. . . .
Q. Wasn't that lost in fighting over tactics during primaries? Can't that happen again if Gore acts as McCain did?
MR. BUSH: First of all, Al Gore is no John McCain. Please don't lump John into that category. Secondly, I think John McCain is a person that basically wanted to elevate the discourse and had a reason for running, rather than tearing somebody down.
I know everybody said this was a dirty campaign. Compared to many campaigns, it wasn't and the proof is that we had huge turnouts in our primaries, huge, much bigger than the Democrats and much bigger than the past. And the reason why was in spite of what the punditry said, people were hearing positive things. They were hearing positive things about education. They were hearing things about the military.
I know that some are saying that people aren't interested in tax relief. I happen to think they are. And even if they weren't, I'd still be talking about it, because I happen to think it's important for the economic growth.
Q. Polls say voters aren't demanding a huge tax cut and that they trust Al Gore more on the tax issue. Is that not like campaigning with weights around your ankles?
MR. BUSH: May I make something really clear to you, once again, and I hope this pleases you. I don't care what the polls say. I don't. . . . I think it's right for economic reasons. You've heard me talk about what's wrong with this tax code. It's wrong for people who are making $22,000 a year to pay a higher marginal rate on every dollar earned than someone making $200,000 a year. That's wrong. And I hope this doesn't sound blase: I don't care what the polls say. It's not going to change my opinion about what I think should happen. . . .
Q. How critical is your tax plan to winning this election?
MR. BUSH: It's a part of what's critical to my election. What's critical to my election is a lot of things. One, that people trust my judgment. Two, that people hear the call for reform. Three, that people know that I can renew what I call the spirit of America. Four, that people are comfortable with the types of people that I'll bring into my administration. Five, whether people are happy or not with the status quo. I readily concede that if people want four more years of Clinton-Gore, I've got a tough road. I do. I know what my position is. I'm the outsider, and I'm the challenger. I'm coming from outside Washington, and I'm the challenger candidate. People say, I hear them talking out of Washington, well, he doesn't have enough experience. As if being the governor of the second biggest state and having served as a C.E.O. in the private sector isn't experience. It's a Washington mentality. And I'm going to have to battle it. I'm fully aware of the odds I'm going to face.
It's a well thought-out plan. And I'm going to have to battle. I'm going to have battle with the polls. I'm going to have to battle with a president who wants to keep the money in Washington. I'm going to have to battle with a vice president who'll say risky this, risky that. I understand that. But I believed it when I laid it out and I believe it while I'm sitting right here today, after having won some primaries and lost some primaries. This is right for America.
Q. Has John McCain elevated your consciousness about reform? Has he changed your views?
MR. BUSH: No, he didn't change my views. He made me a better candidate. He forced me to play to my strengths better. I needed to make it more clear that I not only believe in reform, I've got the record as a chief executive of getting reform done. There's nothing like the humbling experience of getting whipped pretty bad in New Hampshire to cause a man to re-evaluate. And I re-evaluated my message and I re-evaluated how I was conducting myself as a candidate. I wasn't doing as good a job as I could have explaining where my strength is. And my strength is as somebody when, giving the chance to reform, like education, I brought both Republicans and Democrats together. That's what this country needs, when it comes to Social Security, for example.
When it's all said and done, I think America's going to turn to me. I've got a record of doing it. The vice president is extremely partisan. He's extremely partisan.
Q. Is there anything McCain brought to light for you or changed your opinion on in any way?
MR. BUSH: No, not really. We agreed more than we disagreed. That's the great irony. You know, primaries are struggles, arguments over shades of gray. And that's what makes primaries difficult. In my case, I've known John a long time. And battling with John wasn't all that pleasant, because I like him. . . .
Q. What about Al Gore's public life do you dislike so much?
MR. BUSH: I don't like the acrimony in Washington. I don't like the zero-sum politics. I don't like pitting one group of people against another. I don't like the way they've handled whether or not he knew about raising money from the White House -- you know, iced tea and all these kinds of excuses. . . .
Q. Do you regret the turn of the whole campaign?
MR. BUSH: I regret being called an anti-Catholic bigot. . . .
Q. How involved are you in the day-to-day decisions of the campaign?
MR. BUSH: This is important if you're trying to leap from here to the presidency. I know the difference between being somebody who sets the vision and sets the tone and enunciates the principles by which decisions are being made and someone who is a micro-manager. Being a candidate itself is a lot of work. I can't tell you all the times when I say I'm not going to give this speech. It happens a lot. I can be pretty stubborn.
People make suggestions on what to say all the time. I'll give you an example; I don't read what's handed to me. People say "Here, here's your speech, or here's an idea for a speech." They're changed. Trust me. Last night's a good example. We could have been a lot harsher in tone on Vice President Gore last night. I chose not to. What I think is important is not to get mired in a slugfest with this guy. That's what he wants. And last night one of the drafts I got was pretty tough. I said I'm not going to talk about him this way, because I wanted to talk about education.
Q. When you look at some of the situations where the United States is trying with mixed success to broker peace talks, do you have sympathy for what Clinton is trying to do or do you blame him?
MR. BUSH: Take Northern Ireland for example. I have been on the record applauding the efforts to use our prestige to bring people together. It's very important for Americans and elected officials to be patient with the peace process. To be diligent and patient. It's very important for a president not to impose a United States solution on the peace process. So to the president's credit, it seems to me on the Middle East he's working hard to bring people together.

HIGHER CANADIAN INFLATION

BYLINE: By Timothy Pritchard 

 BODY:
Rising oil prices pushed Canada's annual inflation rate to a five-year high of 2.7 percent in February, up from 2.3 percent in January, Statistics Canada said. Gasoline prices were 31 percent higher than a year earlier. Excluding energy, the consumer price index rose by 1.6 percent last month, more than economists had expected after a 1.4 percent advance in January. With oil prices higher again this month, economists predict inflation for March will be close to 3 percent -- the maximum the Bank of Canada has said is acceptable. At the least, the central bank is expected to try to slow the economy by following any interest rate increases imposed by the Federal Reserve in the United States. Timothy Pritchard (NYT)

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE TEXAS GOVERNOR;
BUSH REBUFFS BID TO EMBRACE VIEWS PUSHED BY McCAIN

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE and FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., March 15

 BODY:
Rebuffing calls from prominent Republicans to reach out to Senator John McCain, Gov. George W. Bush insisted today that he had no intention of making concessions to his vanquished rival for the Republican Presidential nomination.
Mr. Bush passed up several opportunities to embrace Mr. McCain's remedy for overhauling the campaign finance system, the senator's signature issue. Mr. Bush said he had learned nothing new about reform from Mr. McCain, although he conceded that his challenger had forced him to be a more spirited competitor. And he was sparing in his praise of Mr. McCain, whose supporters Mr. Bush's campaign is counting on to help him win the general election. 
 "He didn't change my views," Mr. Bush said in an hourlong interview at the governor's mansion here on the day after he all but officially clinched his party's nomination.
Asked if Mr. McCain had illuminated any new ideas for him or affected his positions, he said, "No, not really." Excerpts, Page A20.
Reminded that Mr. McCain helped propel record turnouts in the primaries, Mr. Bush responded curtly, "Well, then, how come he didn't win?" The governor noted that in South Carolina his candidacy helped draw record numbers of Republicans to the polls.
Mr. Bush's comments were notable because they suggested that despite the bruising, bitter and sometimes humbling nature of his primary campaign against Mr. McCain, the governor emerged without any regrets about his campaign's conduct, any second thoughts about his strategy or any new resolves for the way he positions himself for the general election. His confidence, if anything, seemed fortified.
As with the overhaul of campaign finance laws, he did not cede ground on any of his positions. He said, for example, that he was not daunted by polls showing that his plan to cut taxes by $483 billion over five years had not caught on with voters. The proposal, he said, would be a pillar of his campaign.
"May I make something really clear to you, once again?" Mr. Bush asked. "I don't care what the polls say. I don't."
Insisting there was no reason to turn back, he explained, "It's a well thought out plan backed by numbers, backed by credible sources, and it's something I'm going to stay with, you bet."
The governor said he was not deterred -- or haunted -- by the memory that voters were never drawn to the ambitious tax-cut proposal of Bob Dole, the Republican presidential nominee four years ago.
"It's different because, one, I started early, and, two, there's a different budget projection," he said, drawing a contrast with the plan Mr. Dole put forth late in the campaign. "There's a different budget picture. I'm still going to have to fight the same thing he fought, with an administration that's desperate to keep the money in Washington."
Signs that the economy is getting a bit shakier are "all the more reason to provide tax relief," he said, explaining that his plan would not only jolt the economy but also provide insurance against any downturn.
To persuade Americans to back his plan, he said: "I'm going to have to battle. I'm going to have to battle with a vice president who'll say risky this, risky that."
But Mr. Bush said that in the end, voters would be less moved by whatever sniping occurred between him and Vice President Al Gore and would make their decisions based on a few overarching considerations.
"What's critical to my election is a lot of things," he said. "One, that people trust my judgment. Two, that people hear the call for reform. Three, that people know that I can renew what I call the spirit of America. Four, that people are comfortable with the types of people that I'll bring into my administration. Five, whether people are happy or not with the status quo.
"I readily concede that if people want four more years of Clinton-Gore, I've got a tough road. I do.
"I know what my position is. I'm the outside, and I'm the challenger. I'm coming from outside Washington, and I'm the challenger candidate. People say, I hear them talking out of Washington, well, he doesn't have enough experience. As if being the governor of the second biggest state and having served as a C.E.O. in the private sector isn't experience. It's a Washington mentality. And I'm going to have to battle it. I'm fully aware of the odds I'm going to face."
Mr. Bush's aggressiveness toward Mr. Gore was the latest reminder of how quickly the general election campaign had become ferocious. The governor made no effort to mask his animosity toward Mr. Gore.
With little prompting at the start of the interview, Mr. Bush said his Democratic rival was not to be trusted. Scoffing at an e-mail message Mr. Gore sent to him on Tuesday night calling for something of a disarmament on both sides' use of unregulated soft money, Mr. Bush said: "I don't trust the man. He has no credibility as far as I'm concerned about campaign funding reform."
Mr. Bush repeated six times that he did not trust Mr. Gore.
Specifically, Mr. Gore said in his message that he had instructed the Democratic National Committee not to spend a cent of soft money for issue commercials against the Republicans unless the Republicans did so first.
Christopher Lehane, Mr. Gore's spokesman, mocked the governor's comment that the vice president would do anything to win the White House. Mr. Lehane said: "If nothing else, the Republican primary proved one thing: George W. Bush will do anything to get elected, included embracing extreme right positions on choice, gun control, tolerance, the environment and, of course, the economy."
But if Mr. Bush's combative tone toward Mr. Gore was not surprising, his relatively complacent attitude about any remaining rift between him and Mr. McCain was.
It could simply be part of an effort to maintain a brave public face while the campaign's emissaries privately reach out to Mr. McCain. Even so, one of the few times Mr. Bush said something explicitly favorable about the senator was in the course of condemning Mr. Gore.
"First of all, Al Gore is no John McCain," Mr. Bush said. "Please don't lump John into that category. Secondly, I think John McCain is a person that basically wanted to elevate the discourse and had a reason for running, rather than tearing somebody down."
Asked, then, if Mr. Gore had a reason for running, Mr. Bush replied, "I'm sure he's got a reason, but their style, as we've seen from the last eight years, is to demean and degrade."
Mr. Bush's reluctance to reach out more to Mr. McCain, at least publicly, could be politically perilous for the governor. Mr. McCain has won enough delegates to have the leverage to embarrass Mr. Bush at the party's convention this summer.
Even Bush supporters on opposite ends of the Republican spectrum -- from Senator Trent Lott, the Republican leader, to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York -- have called for a rapprochement between the two on reform issues.
Asked whether he needed to make any concessions to Mr. McCain, Mr. Bush said: "No. I think what I need to do is explain to John that we agree a lot more than we disagree. There's a lot of room for reform in Washington, D.C."
But in an interview last week, Mr. McCain said it would be "unacceptable" if Mr. Bush thought they could unite simply over their opposition to President Clinton and Mr. Gore.
Mr. Bush was also unrepentant about the pointed attacks that his campaign -- and supporters of his campaign -- waged on the senator.
Asked if there was anything in particular, he said: "Like what? Give me an example. What should I regret?" Pressed about the negative tone of the campaign, he said, "I didn't take the negative tone."
Mr. Bush was also unwilling to concede that his campaign squandered its record war chest of roughly $70 million to win the primaries. He said he had ordered no changes in his organization and was not worried about spending for the general election, when each campaign will get roughly $67 million in federal subsidies.
Mr. Bush talked about how he managed his campaign and, by extension, how he would function in the Oval Office.
"People make suggestions on what to say all the time," he said. "I'll give you an example: I don't read what's handed to me. People say, 'Here, here's your speech.' Or, 'Here's an idea for a speech.' They're changed. Trust me. Last night's a good example. We could have been a lot harsher in tone on Vice President Gore last night. I chose not to."
Mr. Bush also came to President Clinton's defense in his confrontation with the National Rifle Association, which had asserted that Mr. Clinton was content with a certain prevalence of gun deaths so he could keep gun control as an issue.
"By the way," he said, I didn't think the N.R.A. was right to characterize the president the way they did. I don't believe the president is anxious to use death to advance an agenda."
Nor did he criticize Mr. Clinton as failing to negotiate lasting peace agreements in several regions, from the Middle East to Northern Ireland to Kosovo.
"It's very important for Americans and elected officials to be patient with the peace process, to be diligent and patient," he said. "It's very important for the president not to impose a United States solution on the peace process. So to the president's credit, it seems to me on the Middle East he's working hard to bring people together."
It was not yet time, he said, to turn management of the warring factions in the Balkans over to the United Nations.
The interview closed as it began, with Mr. Bush's attention riveted toward his general election opponent. How fierce a competitor would Mr. Gore be?
"We're about to find out," Mr. Bush said.

HEADLINE: Municipal Workers Seek to Equal Transport Union Gains

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
District Council 37, New York City's largest union of municipal workers, kicked off negotiations yesterday with city officials and demanded many of the same things the transport workers gained in their recent contract battle.
Lee Saunders, the trustee running District Council 37, which represents 125,000 city employees, said his union wanted a wage increase substantially above the inflation rate, and a reduction in employee pension contributions like the one secured by the transport workers. 
 "Our members have sacrificed in terms of making the city healthy again," Mr. Saunders said. "We believe that, based on the city's economic health, its substantial budget surpluses and the productivity increases we're seeing with the reduction in the city's full-time work force, we deserve a fair contract with fair wages."
Because of its size, District Council 37 of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees is expected to have a substantial influence on the new rounds of negotiations for the city's more than 100 unions, representing nearly 300,000 workers. The district council's present five-year contract expires on March 31, but union officials are now seeking a two-year pact, reasoning that, in a time of budget surpluses, large annual increases are more likely to be won in a short-term contract.
Under the current contract, the workers accepted a two-year pay freeze in the first two years and then received raises totaling 12 percent over the last three years. Mr. Saunders declined to say how large a wage increase he was seeking in the new contract, although some members of his union said they hoped for a raise of at least 5 percent a year over the life of any new pact.
The presidents of the district council's 56 union locals joined Mr. Saunders yesterday to present the union's demands to James F. Hanley, the city's labor commissioner.
"It was a standard first bargaining session," Mr. Hanley said. "Their demands were sufficiently vague. We hope to get further clarification as time goes on. We will have proposals for them when we next get together."
Mr. Saunders said the council's negotiations would be influenced by the transport workers' contract, which included a 12 percent wage increase over three years, and by the tentative agreement reached Monday between Gov. George E. Pataki and the Civil Service Employees Association, which represents 77,000 state employees. That contract includes a 13 percent wage increase over four years.
Both that agreement and the transport workers' accord reduce the employee pension contribution by 3 percent of their annual salary -- money that is left in the paychecks of workers.
"I wouldn't say those contracts are models, but they'll clearly have an impact," Mr. Saunders said. "We'll also have to deal with our own concerns."
Among those concerns, he said, were gaining a no-layoff clause, reducing the rising co-payments for prescription drugs and providing cost of living adjustments on pensions. Many retired city employees complain that their pensions have been frozen since 1995 despite continued inflation.
Leaders of District Council 37 say they will take a tougher negotiating line than the council's former executive director, Stanley Hill, who was close to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and accepted the two-year wage freeze. The district council's parent union pushed out Mr. Hill in November 1998, saying he had failed to stop widespread corruption at the council.
Mr. Saunders, the trustee who replaced Mr. Hill, has repeatedly talked tough about his bargaining goals and, unlike Mr. Hill, has often clashed with the mayor.
The council's tougher attitude was reflected in the actions of members yesterday, as they held demonstrations or gave out leaflets yesterday at more than 100 work sites around the city. The leaflets read: "Since taking office, Mayor Giuliani has given himself a 40 percent salary hike. Doesn't the average city worker deserve a reasonable increase?"
District Council 37 represents social workers, secretaries, librarians, cafeteria aides and thousands of other public employees. Mr. Saunders said 75 percent of the union's members are paid less than $35,000 a year -- from $15,000 for school crossing guards to $75,000 for municipal engineers.
About 200 district council members held a lunch-time protest in front of the Municipal Building yesterday, with placards that read, "We Deserve a Good Deal, Not a Raw Deal."
Vermell Jackson, a demonstrator who works as a $23,000-a-year secretary at Police Headquarters, criticized the mayor's call to replace across-the-board pay increases with merit pay that would be awarded only on an individual basis. "That is crazy," she said. "The only way you'd get a raise is if you're the boss's favorite."

HEADLINE: Republicans Can't Match Bush's Plan for Tax Cuts

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15

 BODY:
In taking their first step toward a federal budget for next year, House Republicans were left today in the awkward position of backing a smaller tax cut than their party's presumptive presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush.
The tax and spending blueprint, passed by the House Budget Committee on a near party-line vote of 23 to 18, would provide more money for the Pentagon and education, freeze or cut many other programs and set aside at least $150 billion and perhaps as much as $250 billion for tax cuts over five years starting in 2001. 
 Mr. Bush's plan calls for a tax cut of $483 billion over five years starting in 2002. His plan would require roughly $300 billion for the tax cuts over the period covered by the House Republican plan.
House Republicans insisted they had no disagreement with Mr. Bush over the size of the tax cut and said they were confident that with a Republican in the White House they could find the additional money needed to close the gap between their plans.
A Republican "with a reform agenda" like Mr. Bush could easily squeeze another $50 billion out of government spending over five years, said Representative John R. Kasich, the Ohio Republican who is chairman of the budget committee.
"I'm not backing away from the Bush tax cut and neither are members of this committee," Mr. Kasich said.
But the difficulty that Republican leaders have had in coming up with a plan that would give Mr. Bush all that he wants highlighted their problems in translating their ideological penchant for smaller government into spending restraint that even a Republican-controlled Congress can swallow. And it gave the White House, Vice President Al Gore and Democrats in Congress a new opportunity to portray Mr. Bush's plan as excessive.
Democrats on the budget committee went so far as to tweak the Republicans today by offering an amendment to the budget plan calling for Mr. Bush's tax plan to be included. The amendment was defeated.
Gene Sperling, the director of the White House's National Economic Council, said that "if you were looking for a definition" of fiscal irresponsibility, "it would be a tax cut that was so excessive that even the House Republicans are basically forced to admit they couldn't afford it."
In a statement released tonight, President Clinton responded to the vote by calling the Republican budget plan "risky" and warning that it threatened fiscal discipline that has led to economic prosperity.
Mr. Bush's aides said the situation just helped to make his point that Congress, under pressure from President Clinton, has been far too willing to spend money and that the best remedy was to send as much of the government's revenue as possible back to the people who earned it, the taxpayers.
"The governor believes that money left in Washington is likely to be spent, and that covers both parties," said Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush's spokesman. "It will take a new president to change the way Washington does business and turn things around."
The plan passed by the committee calls for an increase in overall government spending of 3 percent, to $1.85 trillion. About two-thirds of that amount would go to Social Security, Medicare, interest payments on the national debt and other commitments that Congress does not revisit each year.
The other third of the budget, which covers everything from the space program and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to Head Start and environmental programs, would rise by 3.16 percent under the Republican plan, to $596.5 billion.
But nearly all of that increase would go to the military, which would see its budget rise 6 percent next year, to $307.3 billion. The increase in nonmilitary programs would be held to three-tenths of 1 percent, well below the inflation rate, which is running between 2 percent and 3 percent a year.
The plan would set aside $40 billion over five years to finance a yet-to-be developed plan to add prescription drug coverage to Medicare, the health insurance system for the elderly.
The plan would reserve the portion of the surplus generated by excess Social Security revenues to pay down the national debt. It would also create a $60 billion reserve that Congress could use for further debt reduction or additional tax cuts. And it would reserve for tax cuts any surplus beyond what is currently projected by the Congressional Budget Office.
Mr. Kasich said it was not unrealistic to believe that the budget office will increase its surplus projection this year by $40 billion. That money, combined with the $60 billion reserve, would allow the $150 billion tax cut over five years to rise to as much as $250 billion, he said.
Representative John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the senior Democrat on the budget committee, said the proposal would prove to be no more workable than the Republican budget plans of the last few years, which set spending at levels for most programs far below what Congress and Mr. Clinton ultimately agreed upon.
Even before Mr. Kasich had made the details of the Republican plan public, White House officials attacked it.
Jacob J. Lew, the director of the White House's Office of Management, called it "fundamentally flawed" and said it would gut a wide array of programs, from environmental cleanup to aid for poor women and children.

HEADLINE: Finding Camaraderie in the Music of Mah-Jongg Tiles

BYLINE: By SANDEE BRAWARSKY 

 BODY:
The men who play mah-jongg regularly at the Hok Shan Family Association's Chinatown headquarters have been playing the game since they were children. You can see it in their fingers. One man senses a tile as though reading Braille, running his fingers against the carved surface while flipping it over. Another gracefully lifts a horizontal line of 10 or so tiles, applying just enough pressure so that, miraculously, the middle tiles don't fall. These players are economical with their movements, their smiles and their Cantonese.
Elsewhere in Chinatown waiters are known to slip games in during off hours in restaurant kitchens. On the Upper West Side, a group of professional women in their 40's play on alternate Sundays with a set bought on eBay. The sounds of mah-jongg, an echo from a distant past, are alive as the game enjoys a modest resurgence throughout the New York metropolitan area, though in some precincts it never faded. The daughters of an earlier generation of players have reclaimed the game, the influx of Chinese immigrants has added vitality and expertise, and the Internet has expanded the possibilities of how the game is envisioned and played. 
 Many of New York's mah-jongg enthusiasts are Chinese or Jewish, although it is rare for the two groups to mix because they follow different rules and play in different places. In Chinese neighborhoods m.j., as it is often called, has long been popular with many age groups and with both sexes; families often play together. Now, among non-Chinese players, younger women are embracing the game their mothers and aunts played in the city's boroughs and suburbs. With cellular phones nearby, they plot strategy about dragons and winds, sliding faux-ivory tiles across a card table in search of a perfect hand.
Talk about mah-jongg, and the conversation keeps coming back to the tiles. The simple designs, including dots (small buttons), craks (Chinese characters) and bams (pieces of bamboo) -- represented on the tiles in different amounts, the way spades, hearts and clubs are pictured on playing cards -- have an elegance about them. The tiles are painted with thin lines of red, green, blue and black and polished smooth.
Push two together and there is an unmistakable click. Players find the clicks soothing, even when the shuffling of tiles between games sounds like a tap-dance convention. Some players mix with both hands as though kneading dough. Others nonchalantly dip one hand into the heap of tiles in the middle of the table or make vigorous swimminglike motions. (Some Chinese players call the game "table swimming.") Even the name evokes the din of the tiles: "mah" means flax plant, recalling the rustling of leaves, and "jongg" means sparrow.
For experienced players, mah-jongg is like a left-brain, right-brain symphony, with one side involved in analytical play, the other in affable talk. The object is to be the first player to complete a hand, accumulating set combinations of tiles. A 100-year-old man who plays at a Chinatown senior center said that the game kept his mind sharp.
For a Jewish group playing weekly in Hewlett on Long Island, mah-jongg is therapy. Surprisingly, amid the nonstop talk and howling laughter, none of the players seem to miss a beat in the game. Now in their 40's, they recount learning to play in their old Brooklyn neighborhoods or in Catskills bungalow colonies. One of the regulars says that the game got her through chemotherapy, taking her mind off the cancer she is fighting.
Growing up on Long Island, I heard a lot of tiles tapping. My mother played mah-jongg with the same group of women for more than 25 years, every Monday night. I loved the look of the tiles and would try to copy the designs with colored pencils. Although I pretended to play, devising games with other mah-jongg daughters, I never learned the rules. But I understood that this was much more of a ritual than a game.
When the women played in our house I loved to eavesdrop, unseen from the top of the stairs, as they told their stories. So on a recent visit with players in Fair Lawn, N.J., I felt as if I should have been hiding behind the kitchen door in pajamas, not seated. These five 40-something women, three of whom learned the game from their mothers, are passionate about their mah-jongg. If someone can't make the Wednesday game, they shift it to another night; if anyone needs a "fix," they'll schedule an "emergency game." When one player was out sick, they called and left the phone on the table so that she could hear the tiles.
The kibitzing begins as the group gathers, each player with a small purse for her winnings. (The most one could lose in an evening there was $5.) Play starts promptly as they follow the elaborate system of dividing up the wall of tiles and arranging the hands they are dealt on their racks; in each hand, one woman takes a turn sitting out of the game to serve as bettor. Players take turns selecting a tile from the wall and then call out what tile they are discarding. Their jokes and banter -- about their week, children and efforts to avoid the potato chips and pistachio nuts -- is punctuated with "four dot," "flower" and an occasional "I'll take that" when someone claims a discarded tile. The one who completes her hand first calls "Mah-jongg!" and shows her hand.
They pay up, passing quarters or dollars across the table, while displaying and commenting on the unlucky hands. They then push the tiles to the center and joyously shuffle, with their rings and bracelets adding to the racket on the laminated table, and begin again. About 10 minutes have passed, very quickly.
The men at the Hok Shan Family Association on Mott Street, ranging from their 40's to 70's, make the Fair Lawn five look as if they play in slow motion. The tiles have no identifying numbers or letters. There's little talk, no cake, no tile racks, no announcing of discarded tiles, no Monday-morning quarterbacking about the hands they almost had. One hand flows into the next. They'll play a full game, 16 hands, before one of the men lingering nearby might substitute.
Around the corner at the New York Senior Citizen Coalition Center, at the corner of Mulberry and Bayard Streets, many women apply the wisdom of their years to the game. Sitting in foursomes -- some are made up of both men and women, some are all men, but most are all women -- at long lunch tables with thermoses of tea nearby, the players approach the tiles with intensity and refinement. Between hands they exchange chips according to their modest stakes, and by the end of the week they have usually won back whatever they have lost. Several women pause during play to smile at a stranger.
According to a Chinese saying, you shouldn't let your daughter marry someone unless you have played mah-jongg with the family. Using the game as a character meter, you can learn about someone's temper, generosity and honesty. The game can get competitive. Once a man who was feeling the stress of his next move pressed his fingers to his forehead and pushed his head back, not realizing that the tile in his hand was leaving a distinct imprint on his forehead, revealing his strategy.
Many legends surround the Chinese origin of the game, which is said to date to the time of Confucius, or the fifth or sixth century B.C. When mah-jongg was introduced to the United States in the 1920's, it became a national craze, played in clubs and homes under varying rules. In the mid-1930's a group of German-Jewish mah-jongg enthusiasts placed an advertisement in The New York Times inviting interested players to a meeting at the Essex House. They founded the National Mah-Jongg League in 1937 to standardize the game, and every year since have issued a card with updated regulations and a new list of hands. In traditional Chinese mah-jongg, the hands are unchanging.
The new cards are a harbinger of spring, more eagerly awaited in some neighborhoods than the first buds. On or about April 1, about 200,000 laminated red-white-and-blue cards listing the year's official 52 standard hands and rules will arrive at members' homes in regular or optional large-print versions. Within days bags of mail will begin arriving at the league's 57th Street office with opinions about the 2000 edition. A woman distressed by the difficulties of a new card told the league's president, Ruth Unger, that if she were looking for frustration she would have stayed home with her husband.
To design the new card, Mrs. Unger, an associate and six volunteers play mah-jongg six hours a day, three days a week from August to Thanksgiving in the office. Like test drivers for General Motors, they try out 75 new hands, or variations on tile combinations, proposed by a brainstorming committee and select those that work best together. This year there is increased anticipation among players because of the date: the card always features year-related hands and 2000 presents a challenge because there are not many tiles that can represent zero.
Timed with the release of the new card, the National Mah-Jongg League is introducing an Internet game. Members can meet old friends on the league's Web site or play with strangers and, as long as they can type, they can talk. With other software now on the market, people can play American, Chinese and other styles of mah-jongg on the Internet; players can compete against the computer or join a game with other players anywhere in the world.
But whether the game is played Chinese or American style, it takes the same skills to excel, along with luck. In terms of complexity, mah-jongg is somewhere between rummy and bridge. Good players can infer what is concealed in others' hands and shift to another hand if the one they are playing "goes dead." Players must develop an instinct for what to keep and what to discard.
"You have to decide which tiles you're listening to," a Taiwanese-American accountant advises. He and a group of first-generation Taiwanese-American men and women in their 30's and 40's meet occasionally to play mah-jongg on Sundays in Wyckoff, N.J. Their children, munching on pizza bagels, come along to watch. The chatter is a cross between the talk in Hewlett and Chinatown: low-key but persistent, drifting from family news to stocks, from Mandarin to English.
The accountant graciously insists that I take his place, and I play my first hand of mah-jongg. The other players arrange their tiles in perfect walls; I'm trying to keep the top layer of mine from sliding off. When it's my turn, I pick and discard tiles, enjoying the pattern of play. Unlike my mother's tiles, these have no numbers, so I have to count the bams, craks and dots. My mah-jongg mates -- a banker, a graduate student and a computer specialist -- are patient. At the accountant's urging, I call "pung" and take a discarded tile to make a threesome.
I am admiring the way my sequences look, trying to join in the conversation about New York real estate, and relying on my coach to help me so I won't toss out the tile that will make someone else a winner. On the second hand, I have mah-jongg. That they let me win doesn't diminish my sense of small triumph.
Many mah-jongg players say they would play every day if they had time. It is as if sitting with friends face to face through three or more hours of mah-jongg produces something like a runner's high. For some it means entering a zone where the noise of the world is lowered, camaraderie is heightened and the soul is lifted. There is ceremony, mystery, nostalgia, hopefulness -- there's always the next game -- coffee and low-fat cake. Players have too much fun to be smug about it, but they do seem to know something others don't. "There's magic in the tiles," Mrs. Unger says.
Mah-jongg provides continuity and connectedness, but it is, after all, a game. I wonder at the serendipity that brought about this overlap in interests among Jewish and Chinese people. A group in Great Neck, N.Y., used to celebrate both cultures by marking birthdays with lunch and mah-jongg in a kosher Chinese restaurant; the waiters enjoyed watching.
My mother still plays mah-jongg. I no longer peek in, but I feel a sense of awe at her ongoing friendships as well as her dexterity with the tiles. I have her old set, but the case is locked, the key lost. It may be time to break it open.
 
Dragons and Dots, Flowers and Bams
The many versions of mah-jongg include Chinese Classical, Hong Kong Old Style, Shanghai New Style, American, Western, Taiwanese and Filipino, and there are variations within each. The four players agree on table rules before they begin. In American-style mah-jongg a fifth player, the bettor, can alternate in.
A mah-jongg set includes several types of illustrated tiles: four winds (north, east, west and south), three dragons (red, green and white) and flowers. Three suits (dots, bams and craks) are numbered from one to nine. Dots look like tiny buttons, bams are pieces of bamboo and craks are Chinese characters. In American-style mah-jongg only, eight jokers are also used.
As in a card game, the play involves developing a winning hand through rounds of selecting and discarding tiles. In American-style mah-jongg hands are selected from a card published annually. The other styles play with standard hands.
An American-style game begins with players' mixing the tiles, building double-tiered walls of tiles along their racks and then dividing them in a prescribed order. Each player has 13 tiles while the player in the East position has 14. In an exchange called the Charleston, players trade three unwanted tiles to other players in a set order, then make an optional pass to the player opposite. The player who is East then throws out an unwanted tile, face up. The next player, to the right of East, picks a tile from the wall and then throws one out. A player may call a discarded tile to complete a sequence of three (pung), four (kong), or five (quint) of a kind and exposes the matching tiles on the rack. Once a tile is claimed, play procedes with the player to the right of the claimant. This continues until a player completes a hand and calls "mah-jongg."
In the Chinese and other versions, there is no Charleston and different rules apply about claiming tiles and scoring.
For information about playing American-style mah-jongg, visit the Web site of the National Mah-Jongg League, www. nationalmahjonggleague.org. It publishes an introductory booklet, "Mah-Jongg Made Easy."
"Mah-Jongg: Basic Rules and Strategies" by Dieter Kohnen (Sterling Publications) introduces readers to the Classical Chinese style of the game.

Images of a Burnished Utopia Born in a Bleak Reality

BYLINE: By VICKI GOLDBERG 

 BODY:
You might not think that February 1930 was the best time to start a magazine about business. But then you are not Henry Luce. He was already the co-founder of one profitable magazine, Time, seven years earlier. He believed, with President Herbert Hoover, that the stock market crash was one of those corrections that would right itself in a few months.
"Business is, essentially, our civilization," Luce said, "for it is the essential characteristic of our times." Something that central deserved to be honored, and Luce figured that a stock market in peril would stir up interest in it, so he didn't let a little financial earthquake stop his plans for a new magazine. That magazine was not only a financial success but also a gift to American photography and photojournalism. It was called Fortune. 
 The International Center of Photography uptown has a show of 154 original prints of photographs published in Fortune's early years, "Picturing Business: The Photography of Fortune, 1930-1965," organized by the center's associate curator, Ann Sass, in conjunction with Fortune's 70th anniversary. The magazine employed top photographers, from Margaret Bourke-White to Berenice Abbott, Walker Evans to Robert Frank, and it prepared the way for picture magazines like Luce's own pioneering example, Life.
The 130 black-and-white prints in this show are vintage work; the color, much of which is in bad shape or no longer exists as prints, has been digitized from the original transparencies and then printed. Fortune had good color from an early date, when color was still very difficult to print.
Luce said he meant to make "the most beautiful magazine yet attempted in this country," and if you except Alfred Stieglitz's Camera Work, he did. This was the old Fortune, with a larger format than the current magazine, heavy stock and gravure-printed photographs with elegant framing lines drawn around them in the early years. The New York Times said it was "sumptuous to the point of rivaling the pearly gates." The magazine was intended for the rich -- it cost $1 an issue, $10 a year -- and looked it. A copy on your coffee table was a sign of class and promised that you could have the time of your life with Fortune.
It is good to have so many images from the magazine, if only to make clear how important Fortune was to photography. It came closer to telling stories in pictures rather than merely illustrating the text, than any American magazine had before, and in its more formal and elegant way it laid the groundwork for Life. For some reason, the photographs on the museum wall often do not have the impact they had or might have had in print, although some are more beautiful than the magazine reproductions. This can happen to photojournalism; work that was meant for the page may well belong there.
Happily, "Picturing Business" puts a number of the actual magazines on display to show the quality of the reproductions, the brilliance of the magazine's design and layout and the way the photographs were integrated into the story. Fortune was stylistically unified to the nth degree. Everything, from the cover to the print font to the ads, which the art department frequently designed for good customers, had a Fortune look. There was even said to be a Fortune-type photograph, much as other magazines had identifying literary styles.
That photograph in the first decade or so was a kind of burnished, heroic industrial image typified by Bourke-White's gleaming dams and statuesque oil derricks. It showed up in other work, too, like Russell Aikins's photograph of Henry and Edsel Ford in front of the massive steel beams and luminous metal smokestacks of the River Rouge plant, or Arthur Gerlach's vision of brave construction workers high above the city. It carried a message Fortune's readers wanted to hear: that industry was beautiful in itself and thriving, no matter what was going on out on the streets, and that America had the might and the technology to overcome obstacles. The Fortune-type photograph was in effect an image of industrial utopianism.
But in 1931 and 32 Fortune also reported on the bleak side of America earlier and more accurately than many other publications, running articles on racial prejudice, unemployment, occupational disease and death and inadequate housing. Archibald MacLeish, the poet, who wrote for Fortune, said the magazine was a better social historian than The New Masses, a magazine with a more obvious interest in the working class. "Picturing Business" includes two pictures of migrant workers in California made by Horace Bristol while he was working with John Steinbeck, who based "The Grapes of Wrath" on his visits to the migrants' camps.
Fortune also featured small-camera, "candid" photojournalism early in the decade; this became the staple of picture magazines in the 1930's. Time Inc. invited the German photographer Dr. Erich Salomon to the United States, and Fortune made good use of him. Salomon's casual, unposed pictures of statesmen were already well known in Europe, where the new style originated. Images like his photograph of William Randolph Hearst at lunch with his guests, who could neither outshine nor outweigh the silver table fixtures, taught people to expect the inside picture.
The magazine maintained its strong reputation for photography in the 1940's and 50's with fine photographers including Bruce Davidson, Roy DeCarava, Arnold Newman, Gordon Parks and Dan Weiner. As Walker Evans was special photographic editor from the 1940's until 1965 -- his Fortune portfolios on various subjects are well represented in the show at the the center -- photography watchers paid attention to the magazine. Evans also brought in younger photographers, principally Robert Frank, whose 1955 essay on "The Congressional," a businessman's train, is evidence that Fortune admitted a fairly broad range of styles into its pages.
Between 1930 and 1965, as other magazines got into the photographic game, the notion of a Fortune-type photograph had faded. Styles changed after World War II, and so did ideas about the world, even about industry. Trust in an ordered world, a sense that the world could be rationally organized and understood by human minds, lingered in the formal certitudes of a good deal of 1930's photography but basically went up in smoke in World War II. And although that war was won in large measure by industrial might, it had also seen the principles of industry turned into assembly-line killing factories. Robust as American manufacturing was in the postwar years, the utopian faith in industry was fraying at the edges.
When Margaret Bourke-White photographed hog carcasses strung up at Swift & Company in 1933, she emphasized their bulk and the rhythm of their repetitive shapes, bestowing on them a kind of piggy grandeur. When Jerry Cooke photographed Harley-Davidson motorcycles in 1950, he saw them as jumbled, irregular shapes of blue and red that reduced a lone worker to insignificance in the middle of a cheerful, manufactured chaos. In 1950 industry was still king, but the time was not all that far off when the king must die.

HEADLINE: The Rules Nasdaq Forgot

BYLINE: By Robert H. Frank; Robert H. Frank, a professor of economics at Cornell University, is the author of "Luxury Fever" and co-author of "The Winner-Take-All Society."

DATELINE: ITHACA, N.Y.

 BODY:
The story is told of two economists on their way to lunch who spot what appears to be a $100 bill lying on the sidewalk. When the younger economist stoops to pick up the bill, his older colleague restrains him, saying, "That can't be a $100 dollar bill."
"Why not?" asks the younger colleague. 
 "If it were," comes the reply, "someone would have picked it up by now."
The older economist might have been wrong about that particular bill, of course. Yet his admonition embodies an important truth that Americans seem increasingly determined to ignore -- namely, that low-hanging fruit in public places gets picked very quickly. As in the past, the only way to make real money in the future will be through some combination of talent, thrift, hard work and luck.
Tens of millions of Americans, however, now seem to believe they can get rich in a hurry by simply transferring their money from old-economy stocks, like General Motors or Procter & Gamble, into Oracle, Cisco Systems and other high-tech stocks that have led the Nasdaq index.
So far that strategy has worked like a charm. Someone who invested $100,000 in the Nasdaq index in January 1992 is now holding shares that are worth more than $850,000, and that takes this week's ups and downs into account. Many bullish analysts insist that the ride is far from over, and no one can doubt that the new technologies have thus far generated only a tiny fraction of the gains in productivity they will ultimately produce. It may be no exaggeration, for example, to say that business-to-business e-commerce will reduce the operating costs of many companies by 30 percent or more.
The ultimate value of an e-commerce company, however, depends not on the gains made possible by its technology, but on how much profit it generates.
As in the past, new technologies will continue to generate a burst of new profits for companies that are relatively quick to adopt them. But the historical pattern has been that competition will award the long-run savings from these technologies to consumers in the form of lower prices.
Thus dairy farmers who were quick to adopt bovine somatotropin, the hormone that increases milk yields by as much as 20 percent, reaped a short-term windfall, but as use of the hormone spread, increased production pushed milk prices steadily downward, eroding profit margins.
A similar profit trajectory will characterize most Nasdaq purveyors of new technologies. Organizers of business-to-business e-commerce may indeed save manufacturers hundreds of billions of dollars. But because the new technology companies are no more insulated from competition than dairy farmers, most of those savings will take the form of lower product prices, not higher profits.
Armed with this simple insight, economists have long warned investors against betting their entire fortunes on new technology companies. Many sophisticated portfolio managers share these concerns.
The reality, however, is that investors who want to insulate themselves from risk have no safe haven in today's market.
The cautious investor's natural inclination is to focus on old-economy stocks that are not yet selling for astronomical multiples of their annual earnings. Yet investing in those companies entails another form of risk. If millions of additional Americans continue putting their money behind high-tech companies each month, someone who fails to buy Nasdaq stocks will continue missing out on the greatest financial bonanza in generations.
Thus far, the latter risk is the one people seem most intent on avoiding. The small handful of investment firms whose cautious managers built portfolios that were light on high-tech stocks in recent years have seen their clients depart in droves. For such firms, to continue advising against high-tech stocks is to risk extinction.

Earlier this week, the Nasdaq index plunged almost 9.3 percent from its peak of more than 5,000, set just last Friday. At the same time, the old-economy stocks of the Dow Jones industrials staged a modest rebound.
Is this the beginning of a major realignment, notwithstanding the index's gains yesterday? Someone who knew the answer to that question would not have to work for a living.
But the likely outcome is that the pattern of recent years will continue a while longer. After all, the Nasdaq has swooned many times during its protracted run-up, and each time investors have rushed in to buy tech stocks at the new "bargain" prices, as they seem to have done again yesterday.
If the Nasdaq's upward spiral resumes, still more investors will feel compelled to jump on board. In such an environment, the only thing certain is that a spectacular downturn lies out there somewhere.

HEADLINE: German Cleared to Head I.M.F. as Rivals Bow Out

BYLINE: By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
The contentious five-month-long scramble to find a new leader for the International Monetary Fund came to a de facto conclusion today, as the Japanese and American rivals for the job formally withdrew their nominations and cleared the path for a German to take the post for the first time in the fund's history.
Fund officials said the election of the German, Horst Kohler, who heads the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, was now certain. An overwhelming majority of its 182 nations have signaled that they will back him. 
 A coalition of African and Arab countries that had backed Stanley Fischer, the American who serves as deputy managing director of the monetary fund, withdrew his candidacy today. And Japan said it would vote for Mr. Kohler and was no longer pushing the candidacy of Eisuke Sakakibara, former vice finance minister for international affairs.
Mr. Kohler, on a visit to Washington with Germany's finance minister, Hans Eichel, had breakfast with Mr. Fischer today and lunch with Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers. The Clinton administration tipped the scales in favor of Mr. Kohler this week when it agreed to support him. He also won the backing of the 15-nation European Union.
Mr. Fischer, a former Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who is well regarded by fund members for his day-to-day stewardship, reaffirmed his intention of remaining in the No. 2 post.
"I had an excellent meeting this morning with Mr. Kohler, during which we discussed the challenges the fund faces," Mr. Fischer said in a statement. "I am confident that under his leadership, the fund will become an even more effective institution. I look forward to working closely with him."
The development ends the leadership struggle at the fund, which has been under intense pressure to streamline even with its increasing prominence as a sort of world central bank. The United States rejected Germany's first choice, arguing that the candidate, Caio Koch-Weser, a state secretary in the Finance Ministry, did not have the financial skills or leadership experience.
The rejection set off a feud of sorts with Germany, which had chanpioned Mr. Koch-Weser and lined up grudging acceptance from the European Union. After failing to win broad support for him in a round of voting at the fund, the Germans backed Mr. Kohler.
Neither man tops the lists of European financial officials. But Mr. Kohler gained relatively quick endorsement, at least in part because the European Union and the United States had no desire to pick another fight with Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, who had vested prestige in winning the job for a German.
Mr. Kohler, 57, served as a top economic aide to Mr. Schroder's predecessor as chancellor, Helmut Kohl. Now, as head of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, he helps finance development projects and back businesses in the former Soviet bloc.

HEADLINE: Group Wants Con Ed to Pay Failure Costs

BYLINE: By ANDREW C. REVKIN 

 BODY:
Citing a law that requires a utility to pay for its mistakes, a group of New York State legislators and customers petitioned the state Public Service Commission yesterday to prevent Consolidated Edison from passing on to customers costs associated with the shutdown of its Indian Point 2 nuclear power plant.
The petitioners said Con Ed should pay for electricity it is having to buy to make up for the temporary loss of power from its plant, because it knew for many years that four aging steam generators were increasingly prone to leaking and chose not to replace them. Con Ed has estimated the cost at $600,000 a day. 
 The emergency shutdown occurred on Feb. 15 when a corroded tube in one of the generators burst. Federal officials have said it will be at least several weeks before the plant is restarted.
Earlier this week, Andrew J. Spano, the Westchester county executive, proposed a lawsuit that had a similar goal but cited a different law. The county Board of Legislators is expected to consider approving the suit when it meets on March 27.
But Richard L. Brodsky, the chairman of the Assembly Committee on Environmental Conservation and a Westchester Democrat, said that he initiated the new action, called a prudency petition, because it had a better chance of succeeding and had been used before.
In 1982, Robert Abrams, the state attorney general, used the petition process to win a $33.7 million refund from Con Ed after the Public Service Commission ruled that a 59-day shutdown of Indian Point 2 caused by a different kind of leak was caused by "imprudent actions."
Mr. Brodsky said there were ample indications this time that the shutdown was an avoidable consequence of economic decisions by the company. "There is powerful evidence," he said, "that this company tried to squeeze every drop of juice from this lemon and failed to recognize repeated signs that these kinds of ruptures were inevitable."
Last night, a spokesman for Con Ed, Joseph Petta, said he could not discuss the move because the utility had not yet received a copy of the petition.
In recent public meetings, Con Ed officials and inspectors from the federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission have said that Indian Point 2 was running well in the days before the emergency shutdown and that leakage rates -- until Feb. 15 -- were far below federal limits.
David Flanagan, a spokesman for the state commission, said the shutdown was already being investigated, adding that the commission could order refunds with or without a petition from customers.
"Obviously," he said, "we will give it a full review, and it's up to the commission to determine if we should initiate a proceeding."
Mr. Brodsky said that an added benefit of a prudency petition, if accepted by the commission, is that it would shift the burden of proof away from state officials and instead force Con Ed to prove that it had acted responsibly before the shutdown.
Finally, he said, the inquiry by the commission would take place in a series of public hearings, not in private discussions between state officials and the utility.
"It's easier for ratepayers to be treated fairly in an open public proceeding," Mr. Brodsky said.

HEADLINE: In New Jersey, Sprawl Keeps Outflanking Its Foes

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON 

DATELINE: HOPEWELL, N.J., March 16

 BODY:
Leslie Kramer and her husband moved into a big Victorian house in this rural township five years ago to get away from congestion in Westchester County. Carol Ferry and her husband moved here from Hamilton, on the other side of Trenton, for the same reason.
So have hundreds of their neighbors who thought that here, at last, they would be safe from sprawl. 
 After all, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman had said that she would make New Jersey a national model for controlling growth in ways that would protect open space and direct growth back to urban areas. Governors across the country, including George E. Pataki of New York and John G. Rowland of Connecticut, have recently begun programs with similar goals.
But like forest creatures who are too slow to outrun a wildfire, the Kramers and the Ferrys have found that the crowded old neighborhoods they tried to flee are on their way to them, led by a giant new development that could produce more office space than a tower of the World Trade Center. And when new census figures this month showed formerly rural parts of New Jersey growing faster than any other place in the region, it was a reminder that stopping sprawl and talking about it are two very different things.
"I'll tell you what I believe -- you can't stop it," said Ms. Kramer, the leader of a failed effort to stop Merrill Lynch from building a project that starts at 3.5 million square feet and could grow to 5.5 million in an old cornfield here. "My husband hit me over the head with that fact all along and I didn't believe him. I kept saying, 'No, this is so wrong on so many levels -- look what it's doing to our community, look how it violates the state plan, look how it goes against everything the governor said she was going to do!' But you know, he was right. You can't stop it, not if the people with the money want it."
If anything, anti-sprawl measures like New Jersey's plan and the governor's fervent calls to protect open space may only deepen residents' sense of betrayal when a project like the one being built by Merrill Lynch here starts rising, in a neck of the state that looks more like Vermont than New Jersey.
The Hopewell project, which began construction about two years ago to replace leased back-office space for Merrill Lynch, also demonstrates anew how money and jobs -- in this case the threat to move 3,500 jobs to Pennsylvania -- can trump public land preservation policy.
So whether it is the project here, or the 1 million square feet of laboratories AT&T recently opened in Middletown, Monmouth County, or the plans to develop 2,000 acres of woods near Stewart Airport in Orange County in New York, sprawl continues to march on across the region.
Some figures from New Jersey: Of the 9.9 million square feet of office space authorized by local officials last year through November, nearly two-thirds is being built in an outer ring of largely rural counties of Morris, Somerset, Hunterdon, Monmouth, Mercer and Ocean.
Somerset, the fastest-growing county in the New York metropolitan region, added more than half a million square feet alone, while Mercer County, home of Princeton and Hopewell and two hours from Manhattan, leads the state with 2.1 million square feet of office space authorized last year, much of it from the Merrill Lynch project.
The Regional Planning Partnership, a nonprofit land-use planning group that studies growth in Mercer, Somerset and Middlesex Counties, forecasts a 40 percent population increase by 2020 there. Even more striking than population growth trends, however, are land-use trends.
Between 1986 and 1995, before the boom began in earnest, Somerset County ate up 10 percent of its open space. Monmouth developed 9.1 percent, Mercer 8.8.
Governor Whitman, in her 1998 inaugural address, announced a $1 billion open space preservation bond act, to buy 1 million acres, and declared, "We must do more to encourage intelligent, responsible growth for New Jersey's future, especially in our cities." Voters passed the bond act almost 2 to 1.
In January, Governor Pataki of New York created a Quality Communities Task Force to study how to direct growth in ways that emphasize redevelopment and reduce sprawl. In Connecticut, Governor Rowland has declared a goal of tripling the amount of land protected from sprawl in the next 25 years.
But the new pledges to stem sprawl have come too late for residents here, who failed to follow the local planning process until it was too late, said Samuel H. Hamill Jr., a former local planning board president and now senior consultant to New Jersey Future, a nonprofit land-use research group. That aloofness from the nitty-gritty of planning issues, he said, is now ending.
"Not only did the governor's bond act pass, but there were any number of local elections that turned on these very questions," Mr. Hamill said.
Merrill Lynch had one big factor in its favor: the land the company chose was zoned for a big project like the company's, however incongruous it might seem to someone driving slowly by on the rural lane that bordered the site. But if the state had any misgivings, they were erased when Merrill Lynch made plain that it was going to be Hopewell or another state, probably an equally rustic corner of Pennsylvania. Governor Whitman, concerned with the company's threat to pull 3,500 or more jobs from the state, gave the project political and financial support.
The state applied for and got $38.5 million in federal money to rebuild the interchange at Interstate 95 and Scotch Road, where the Merrill Lynch project is being built, and it has agreed to help the company avoid $13.5 million in sales taxes. In addition, the state said it would give the company $6.4 million to create at least 1,100 jobs at the site, which will eventually employ 3,500. Finally, Merrill Lynch, the country's largest brokerage house, will get $135 million more in grants for job creation at all 11 of its New Jersey sites.
Eileen McGinnis, the governor's chief policy adviser, lives in Hopewell and defends the project, even as she has her own personal misgivings about it. "I separate my personal feelings from my professional feelings," she said. "On a personal level I drive by it every day and I do wish the project wasn't there. But on a professional level I know that the state plan is not about no growth, it's about smart growth."
The State Development and Redevelopment Plan, adopted in 1992 as guidelines for directing growth to areas that are already built up or have transportation access, is often invoked by preservationists for its goal that the state should use its power to push some development toward the state's hollowed-out cities. But the plan's guidelines are advisory, not mandatory, and subject to economic and political pressures.
The Merrill Lynch site is designated for growth under the state plan as an area with retail stores or other public amenities. Critics point out, however, that there is no public component in the 3.5 million-square-foot first phase.
The site is also designated as a growth area under the plan because it is adjacent to an interstate highway. But Jeff Tittle, executive director of the New Jersey Sierra Club, maintains that by helping Merrill Lynch build on a pristine rural site, the state is working against its own aim of buying land for a public greenway trail from the Delaware River to Princeton through Hopewell, because all land in the area will now be made much more expensive by the immense development.
Yet building deep in the country makes perfect sense from the company's perspective, said Mr. Hamill, even though the state may have wished that the project had gone to a city like Trenton, which has acres of unused industrial space and which lies only a few miles from here.
"The cities in general, and Trenton is no exception, are much less certain than the suburbs as planning environments," Mr. Hamill said. "Things don't happen as quickly in the cities, building inspections aren't on time and policy plans are much more vague, so anyone going there has this uncertainty in the approval process."
In fact, when Merrill Lynch told the state that it would build in Hopewell or leave the state, state officials gingerly raised the idea of building in Trenton.
"Merrill Lynch officials said very clearly that they would not look at Trenton," said Tom Dalessio, Ms. McGinnis's assistant in the governor's policy office. "They wanted a suburban-style campus, so it was either here or Pennsylvania."
In Hopewell, Merrill Lynch found 450 acres of open farmland that had been owned, with development in mind, by Bristol-Myers Squibb, the pharmaceutical concern, from 1955.
It also found a five-member all-Republican town board with strong landowner sympathies that welcomed the prospect of millions of dollars in new taxes for sewers and schools. It did not hurt that the company also bought 440 acres across the road from the family of William E. Schluter, an influential state senator who sits on the Economic Growth, Agriculture and Tourism Committee.
Merrill Lynch has final approval to build 1.3 million square feet of office space on the land, and has preliminary approval to build 2.2 million more at the site. The adjacent 440 acres is zoned for 2 million square feet of commercial development, for a total of 5.5 million square feet of potential, and probable, construction on both sides of the road. One World Trade Center Tower contains 4 million square feet.
Local reaction followed the now-familiar arc from surprise to anger to despair. An anti-growth coalition swept the Republicans off the town board and replaced them with a 4-to-1 Democratic majority, which succeeded in stopping Merrill Lynch's preferred sewer option -- it has others -- but could not block the development.
To Harry J. Ferguson, Merrill Lynch's vice president for real estate operations, the level of anger here in the outer suburbs was new. "We have not run into it before." Mr. Ferguson said. "We typically try to make sure that we're doing what the community wanted us to do, and that's why we look for areas that are already zoned and preapproved. So we were caught a little off guard by the reaction to this."
Now Mrs. Ferry, an office worker, has to wonder if she and her husband, Dennis, a chemist, should think of moving again, to stay ahead of the wave.
When they moved from their starter home in Trenton to a house in Hamilton in 1978, they had fields behind them. When they left for Hopewell in 1985, Mrs. Ferry said, the fields in Hamilton were covered with houses, and a drive that once took 10 minutes took half an hour.
"Where do we go next?" Mrs. Ferry wondered. "There's really no place you can go to hide."

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS;
Credit Suisse Under Scrutiny for Ukrainian I.M.F. Loans

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY L. O'BRIEN with JOSEPH KAHN 

 BODY:
Credit Suisse Group, the European banking giant, has long plied the unpredictable waters of overseas financial markets with elan, earning a reputation as a swashbuckler in corners of the globe as far afield as the former Soviet Union and East Asia.
The bank has made lush profits in many of those markets but has also suffered bruising losses when speculative fervor overseas turned against it in recent years. Still, Credit Suisse remains an important player in emerging markets, particularly in the former Soviet Union. 
 Now, Credit Suisse is on the hot seat. Allegations of improprieties in the way the Ukrainian central bank managed International Monetary Fund loans are raising serious questions about the bank's role in the matter.
The bank's chairman, Rainer E. Gut, has been asked to testify before the House Banking Committee next week at a hearing examining money laundering and the possible misuse or theft of I.M.F. money.
The I.M.F. disclosed this week that the Ukrainian central bank engineered a series of financial transactions -- some through Cyprus -- to inflate artificially its foreign currency reserves so that the country could obtain hundreds of millions of dollars in I.M.F. loans that otherwise might have been denied. Some of the transactions were conducted with the help of Credit Suisse's investment banking arm, Credit Suisse First Boston, according to government investigators in the United States.
The I.M.F. has retained the accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers to audit the transactions for any evidence of wrongdoing and a report is expected by the end of the month. The Ukrainian government and Credit Suisse have repeatedly denied any wrongdoing.
"We've examined all the transactions in question and we've found nothing to cause us to believe that any of those transactions were inappropriate or illegal," a Credit Suisse spokesman said in an interview. Credit Suisse, citing bank secrecy laws in Cyprus, declined to comment about whether it knew that transactions it conducted for the Ukrainian central bank artificially increased reserve levels.
Credit Suisse was one of the first foreign companies to receive a commercial banking license from the Ukrainian government and the bank has conducted a wide variety of financial services for the government. Just this week, Credit Suisse was one of several banks that helped Ukraine repackage almost $3 billion in foreign debt to avoid a default.
Western financiers said that Alexander Bazarov, who runs Credit Suisse First Boston's Kiev office, has played a key role in winning business for Credit Suisse with the Ukrainian government. And the authorities in the United States said that Mr. Bazarov was the banker responsible for channeling the central bank funds in question through Cyprus. Mr. Bazarov could not be reached for comment, and Credit Suisse declined to comment on questions about him.
Mr. Bazarov, a Ukrainian citizen who once worked in the Ukrainian central bank, is said to be close to Viktor Yushchenko, Ukraine's prime minister. Mr. Yushchenko was formerly the head of Ukraine's central bank. Earlier this week, Mr. Yushchenko canceled a visit to the United States after the Clinton administration told him he should come only after "cleaning up his government." Ukrainian officials said the trip was canceled because of a mining disaster at home.
Mr. Yushchenko's visit was discouraged soon before the Treasury Department and the I.M.F. disclosed the Ukrainian central bank's financial maneuvers late Wednesday.
The I.M.F., a public agency financed by several Western governments, has been widely criticized for lax lending and oversight in the former Soviet Union. But it is the private and very profitable Western commercial and investment banks that have provided the financial plumbing underlying many of the transactions under investigation.
Interest in the role played by Western financial institutions in possibly aiding financial misdeeds in the former Soviet Union was heightened by last year's disclosure that $7 billion in suspect Russian money was funneled through the Bank of New York. The Bank of New York has not been charged with wrongdoing and is cooperating with the investigation.
The Financial Times was the first publication to report on Credit Suisse's involvement with the Ukrainian central bank. One of those cited by the paper as providing information about Credit Suisse was Joel Bartow, a former F.B.I. agent who once worked as a member of the legal defense team for Pavlo Lazarenko, a former Ukrainian prime minister. Mr. Bartow has been out of the country and did not return phone calls seeking comment.
Mr. Lazarenko is being detained by the federal authorities in California while they consider extradition requests from Switzerland and Ukraine on charges of embezzling state funds and money laundering. As prime minister, Mr. Lazarenko may have pocketed millions of dollars from state programs, according to Ukrainian, Swiss and United States authorities.
Mr. Lazarenko has a personal interest in any stories that impugn the integrity of Ukraine's government.
His wealth and power were growing so briskly during 1996 and 1997, his two years as prime minister, that the situation led to a rift with Ukraine's president, Leonid Kuchma, who dismissed Mr. Lazarenko from his influential post. Mr. Lazarenko subsequently formed an opposition party and planned to run for the presidency until he fled Ukraine in late 1998, just days before prosecutors there charged him with embezzling millions of dollars in government funds. Mr. Lazarenko has not been charged with any crime in the United States.
Michael Handwerker, a New York lawyer representing Mr. Lazarenko, said that charges against his client were politically motivated and noted that some of Mr. Lazarenko's reputed co-conspirators are now members of Mr. Kuchma's administration.
Mr. Handwerker would not comment on any of the issues involving the Ukrainian central bank and the I.M.F., other than to point out that Mr. Bartow is no longer a member of Mr. Lazarenko's legal team.
Problems with the management of central bank funds in Ukraine bear striking similarities to questions that were raised last year about the management of Russian central bank reserves. I.M.F.-sponsored audits of its lending to the Russian central bank, also conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers, found no evidence of any misappropriation, although the I.M.F. said that the central bank had misled it about the level of its foreign currency reserves.
Nonetheless, questions still linger about how Russian central bank funds were managed through an offshore entity known as Fimaco. Hefty interest payments earned on billions of dollars invested by Fimaco in high-yielding Russian debt still have not been entirely accounted for -- an issue also under scrutiny in the Ukrainian central bank matter.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE REFORM PARTY;
Buchanan Wraps Himself In McCain's Flag of Reform

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES 

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., March 16

 BODY:
Grafting onto the lesson of the presidential primary contests, Patrick J. Buchanan unveiled a retooled stump speech today for his lagging third-party candidacy, packing this year's politically magic phrase "campaign reform" into its every jot and tittle.
Conceding that the losing insurgent effort of Senator John McCain had made campaign reform "the only real issue" in this presidential year, Mr. Buchanan tailored his remarks to that cause as he took his quest for the Reform Party nomination to Harvard University and accused the two major parties of huge fund-raising abuses in "an incumbents protection racket." 
 "Both Beltway parties are chemically dependent on soft money," Mr. Buchanan told an overflow crowd of more than 300 at the John F. Kennedy School of Government in a speech starkly different from the "pitchfork brigade" appeals of past campaigns to voters aggrieved with a variety of economic and social complaints. "We get no soft money and we take no PAC money."
"Neither Beltway party is going to drain this swamp: it's a protected wetland; they breed in it, they spawn in it," Mr. Buchanan added, sparking general laughter and applause.
He even updated his stump graphics with a giant mock check at his side made out for hundreds of millions of dollars to the major parties and signed "Influence Peddlers."
With his candidacy in the doldrums for months, Mr. Buchanan, who left the Republican Party last October, clearly sought to tap into the public appetite for changes in campaign finance laws that Mr. McCain galvanized in his losing challenge to Gov. George W. Bush.
But during Mr. Buchanan's one-hour appearance, students accused him of exploiting some controversial racial and political views in his chronic presidential candidacy. One student accused him of "selling out" his one political virtue, consistency, in jumping to the Reform line. Another, identifying himself as a rare conservative Republican at the Kennedy school, caustically declared, "Thank you for leaving the party."
Mr. Buchanan gave as good as he got, at one point defending his accusation that Harvard employs elitist quotas favoring groups like Jewish- and Asian-American students at the expense of white Christians.
"Simply because you're at Harvard does not exempt you from the same kind of rules and regulations that Harvard lovingly imposes upon the rest of America," he shot back at one critic. "Pat Buchanan is not a beloved figure in America, but neither is Harvard."
To another questioner, Mr. Buchanan conceded the "risk" that he might ultimately succeed only in playing the spoiler's role and drain enough votes from the Republican line to help Vice President Al Gore be elected. In the view of some political specialists, Mr. Buchanan's current standing of about 6 percent in the polls might be enough in a close race to foil Governor Bush. The Reform line created by Ross Perot drew 19 percent of the vote in 1992 and saw President George Bush defeated by Bill Clinton by a plurality.
Throughout his remarks, Mr. Buchanan made clear his determination to stay in the race and fight for an equal spotlight in this fall's televised presidential debates if, as he expects, he wins the Reform nomination. He said that he expected the major parties to try to block this and that he was preparing a lawsuit to challenge for debating time.
"People have ruined the conservative cause," he declared in criticizing Republican leaders and rebutting a questioner who called him "a reactionary in reformer's clothing."
"For the last seven years they conflated the conservative cause with Clinton bashing," he added.
Framing his speech as a detailed cry for change, Mr. Buchanan called for a ban on unlimited contributions to political parties, or soft money, and the creation of a national initiative and referendum process to let voters directly change the system. He also urged the imposition of term limits on Congress, a body he described as so beholden to big-money donors that it had become a "bellhop stand for the business roundtable."
In sum, Mr. Buchanan brandished the same heady mix of political iconoclasm and personal controversy that was his stump signature in 1992 and 1996, when he drew early primary support but failed to win the Republican nomination. His quest this time, in which he has said he will fight Mr. Perot if the latter runs again, is complicated by the need to build political organizations in most of the 29 states where the Reform Party does not exist.
Students questioned how the Reform Party, which in the past shied from social and cultural issues, might ever embrace Mr. Buchanan, whose opposition to abortion has been his political keystone. The candidate replied that he had not altered his views but, rather than feature them in the Reform platform, he would "append" them to the platform as a personal statement.
Mr. Buchanan drew strong applause at the close of a performance in which he handled even a lampoon touch when a young man beamed and asked him out on a date.
"Shelly, would it be O.K.?" Mr. Buchanan asked, turning to his wife with a big grin. Then the candidate guffawed as he told the audience, "She said it would be O.K.!"

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Edge Up Slightly But Oil Remains Inflation Threat

BYLINE: Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
Inflation at the producer level was absent from the nation's economy last month with the exception of higher costs for oil and tobacco products, government figures showed today. Other reports showing gains in housing starts and manufacturing suggested that the economy was continuing its robust expansion.
The overall Producer Price Index rose 1 percent last month after being unchanged in January. But prices paid to factories, farmers and other producers, excluding food and energy costs -- the so-called core rate -- rose 0.3 percent in February after falling 0.2 percent in January, the Labor Department said. Without tobacco prices, February's core rate was unchanged. A surge in the cost of petroleum products last month more than offset declines in prices of autos, computers and drugs. 
 "The inflation problem is still an energy-price problem," said Christopher Low, chief economist at First Tennessee Capital Markets in New York. "The bottom line: There is still no real sign of inflation in core prices."
That will not deter Federal Reserve policy makers from raising interest rates again when they meet on Tuesday, analysts said, because they are still concerned that the economy is growing too fast and threatens to cause an acceleration in inflation. The Fed has raised the rate on overnight loans between banks a full percentage point since June.
Three other reports today reflected the economy's resilience. Starts of new housing rose 1.3 percent in February, led by a 19.2 percent increase in construction of multifamily homes. Starts of single-family houses fell 3.9 percent.
Business at Philadelphia-area factories expanded at an increased pace in March as new orders surged, a Fed report showed. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia's general economic index rose to 25 from 13.3 in February, reaching its highest level since July 1996. Analysts had expected the index to slip to 13.2.
And the Labor Department said first-time claims for state unemployment benefits fell 19,000, to a seasonally adjusted 263,000 last week -- the lowest in 26 years. Claims rose 6,000, to 281,000, the previous week. The four-week average for claims fell to 271,750 -- also the lowest in 26 years -- from 277,500.
The rise in producer energy prices was the biggest increase since October 1990. Oil prices have tripled since December 1998. In New York, crude oil for April delivery rose 37 cents, or 1.2 percent, to $31.09 a barrel today.

HEADLINE: Morris Abram Is Dead at 81; Rights Advocate Led Brandeis

BYLINE: By WILLIAM HONAN 

 BODY:
Morris B. Abram, a small-town boy from Georgia who went on to play a role in the civil rights movement, become a leader of the American Jewish community, serve as president of Brandeis University and fill posts on a variety of commissions and panels under five presidents, died yesterday at a hospital in Geneva. He was 81.
The cause was a sudden viral infection, said Pranay Gupte, a family friend. 
 At his death Mr. Abram, who lived in Geneva, was chairman of U.N. Watch, an organization affiliated with the World Jewish Congress that he founded in 1993 with Edgar M. Bronfman, the businessman and philanthropist. Mr. Abram was also of counsel to the New York law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, where he had been a partner for many years.
In 1973, Mr. Abram was told he had acute myelocytic leukemia. His fight against the disease impelled him to write an autobiography, "The Day is Short," in 1982.
Mr. Abram was a young lawyer in Atlanta specializing in railroad cases in 1949 when he began a 14-year struggle to overturn a Georgia electoral rule that gave disproportionate weight in primary elections to ballots cast in predominantly white rural areas at the expense of those cast by urban blacks. The rule perpetuated segregation in Georgia.
Mr. Abram felt the sting of the rule in 1953 when he sought the Democratic nomination for Congress from the Fifth District. He ran on a platform that urged the desegregation of schools and carried populous Fulton County, which includes Atlanta. But he lost two smaller rural counties that had disproportionate weight under the rule and lost the election.
Over the years Mr. Abram helped bring cases against the rule to the United States Supreme Court. On March 18, 1963, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who had been briefed by Mr. Abram, argued the case before the Supreme Court. In a historic ruling, the court declared the rule unconstitutional because "within a given constituency there can be room for but one constitutional rule -- one voter, one vote."
It was the most notable of Mr. Abram's victories in the civil rights struggle. He also helped to start the first large, middle-income housing project open to black families in Atlanta. And defending civil rights workers in Georgia in 1963, he won decisions that helped overturn the state's insurrection and illegal assembly laws, which had been used against civil rights demonstrators.
Mr. Abram's career in public service began when President John F. Kennedy named him the first general counsel to the Peace Corps in 1961. President Lyndon B. Johnson made him United States representative to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, co-chairman of the Planning Committee of the White House Conference on Civil Rights and a member of the Committee on the Office of Economic Opportunity.
President Jimmy Carter appointed him chairman of the President's Commission for the Study of the Ethical Problems of Medicine. He also served President Ronald Reagan as vice-chairman of the United States Commission on Civil Rights. President George Bush designated him United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Geneva.
Mr. Abram led the Moreland Act Commission, which in 1975 investigated corruption in the nursing home industry in New York. The commission's recommendations led to a number of changes, among them the closing of 68 nursing homes that did not comply with fire-safety codes.
Morris Berthold Abram was born on June 19, 1918, in Fitzgerald, Ga., a small railroad town founded by Northern veterans of the Civil War. He was one of four children born to Sam Abram, a harness maker and storekeeper born in Romania, and the former Irene Cohen, the daughter of a doctor and a granddaughter of Rabbi Elias Eppstein, one of the first Reform rabbis in the United States.
After graduating summa cum laude from the University of Georgia in 1938, Mr. Abram was chosen as a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, but Britain entered World War II before he could attend. Instead, Mr. Abram entered the University of Chicago Law School, graduating in 1940.
After the war, in which he served as an Army Air Corps public relations officer, he attended Oxford, receiving a bachelor's degree in 1948 and a master's degree in 1953. In a summer recess at Oxford, a professor arranged for Mr. Abram to join the staff of prosecutors at the International Military Tribunal at Nuremberg.
Horrified by what he learned about the Holocaust, he regarded the experience as a turning point. He was national president of the American Jewish Committee from 1963 to 1968; chairman of the National Conference on Soviet Jewry from 1983 to 1988; and chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations from 1986 to 1989. He also helped to organize a demonstration of 200,000 people on the Mall in Washington protesting the refusal of the Soviet Union to permit Jews to emigrate to Israel and the West.
In 1963 he and his family moved to New York, where he joined the law firm of Paul, Weiss. Five years later he was named president of Brandeis, the nonsectarian university founded in 1948 under Jewish auspices in Waltham, Mass. He later wrote, "Part of me, it seemed, had done nothing for years except compile the right sort of resume for the job."
But two years later he resigned the post amid turmoil and bitterness.
His inauguration was attended by Coretta Scott King, Bayard Rustin and other figures from the civil rights movement. But soon after, many students and faculty members demanded that the university oppose the war in Vietnam and create housing for the poor, among other demands.
Mr. Abram would have none of it, insisting that "the university as an institution should stay out of politics."
He later acknowledged having made mistakes, like dismissing what he considered an insubstantial proposal for a black studies program with the insensitive remark, "I do not wish to preside over a university of superficialities."
On another occasion, when a group of students asked to be shown the university's investment portfolio to see whether it was "tainted," he said, jokingly, that Brandeis's endowment, compared with those of other major American universities, "taint enough."
The students were not amused. Soon, Mr. Abram recalled, they began to ignore his greetings and many on campus would go out of their way to avoid him.
In January 1969, 65 African-American students occupied Ford Hall. Unlike the administrators of Harvard and Columbia when faced with similar takeovers, Mr. Abram would not call in the police. After 11 days, the students drifted away, and Mr. Abram earned praise in some quarters for his restraint. But Mr. Abram lost whatever credit he earned among many on campus when he tried to punish those responsible for the takeover. This effort was thwarted by the Brandeis board, faculty and disciplinary committees.
Mr. Abram's presidency was fatally wounded. He resigned in 1970 and returned to Paul, Weiss. For the next nine years, he also was chairman of the United Negro College Fund, which raises money for predominantly black colleges and universities.
Mr. Abram's experience at Brandeis hardened his views, and he became a vigorous opponent of affirmative action. This came to the attention of President Reagan, and Mr. Abram was nominated to the United States Commission on Civil Rights in 1983. The nomination was opposed by some prominent blacks who considered him "not committed to equal opportunity," which pained Mr. Abram.
He wrote about it in his autobiography: "Liberalism for me means that, while men differ in their natural endowments, they must be treated as equal citizens in the eyes of the law; that they should possess equality of opportunity and be afforded some minimum of social benefits. These principles, which united American liberals for generations, now divide me from some who seek equality of result and who sanction the preferences imposed by government to attain it."
Mr. Abram, who once considered himself a liberal Democrat, said he never voted for a Democrat for president after Jimmy Carter.
During his career, he was president of the Field Foundation from 1965 to 1982; a board member of the Twentieth Century Fund from 1959 until his death; and a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.
Mr. Abram's marriage to the former Jane Isabella Maguire ended in divorce in 1974 and a second marriage, to Carlyn Feldman Fisher, ended in divorce in 1987. He is survived by his wife, the former Bruna Molina, whom he married in 1990; two daughters, Ann Abram of Westport, Conn., and Ruth J. Abram of Manhattan, who is president of the Lower East Side Tenement Museum.
Also surviving are three sons, Morris Berthold Jr., of Los Angeles, J. Adam, of Chapel Hill, N.C., and Joshua A., of Manhattan; a stepson, Martin Molina of Zurich; a stepdaughter, Gabriela Molina of Cambridge, England; a sister, Ruthann Reis of Washington; a brother, Dr. Lewis Abram of Boca Raton, Fla., and nine grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Chief Says Suit Is Political And He'll Stay At Port Agency

BYLINE: By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 16

 BODY:
Robert E. Boyle, the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, vowed today to remain in his job, and Gov. George E. Pataki said he was welcome to stay, despite accusations by the state attorney general that Mr. Boyle had defrauded the hospital he once headed.
But Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, who has traditionally had veto power over the choice of executive director for the agency, was noncommittal, saying through a spokesman that she wanted to discuss Mr. Boyle's future with Mr. Pataki before commenting publicly. 
 Eliot L. Spitzer, the New York attorney general, filed a civil lawsuit against Mr. Boyle on Wednesday, charging that he had illegally profited from business deals with Hudson Valley Hospital Center in Peekskill when he was its chairman, in the early 1990's. The suit seeks more than $500,000 in restitution to the hospital.
Officials in the Pataki administration and the attorney general's office said earlier this week that they expected Mr. Boyle to leave the authority soon after the accusations were made public, either by resigning or by waiting until his term expires next month and not seeking reappointment. But Mr. Boyle said in a statement released today, "I have no intention of resigning my Port Authority post, and Governor Pataki has encouraged that decision and strongly endorsed my staying in place and fighting the Attorney General's political 'I gotcha' lawsuit."
At a news conference, Mr. Pataki said, "I have no reason to believe he should do anything but continue to serve the people of this state well." He added that he had not asked Mr. Boyle to explain his side of the accusations. And the governor, a Republican, declined to speculate on the motives of Mr. Spitzer, a Democrat, saying only that he was "a little shocked" at the suit.
But the tone from Mrs. Whitman's office was markedly different. "The allegations are of a serious nature, and it's one of a number of things she'd like to talk to Governor Pataki about," said Peter J. McDonough Jr., a spokesman for Mrs. Whitman. "There is some comfort taken in the fact that the allegations are not in any way related to Port Authority business, but before she says anything about his long-term future at the Port Authority, she needs to speak with Governor Pataki."
Officially, the Port Authority's 12-member board, appointed by the two governors, selects the executive director. But by longstanding tradition, the New York governor chooses the executive director and the New Jersey governor selects the board chairman, with each having veto power over the other's choices.
Lewis M. Eisenberg, chairman of the authority, would not comment today on Mr. Boyle. But some authority officials said today that while they considered Mr. Boyle a good manager, they had concerns about his ability to run the sprawling agency while fending off Mr. Spitzer's suit.
Mr. Boyle said the suit was based on "incomplete and inaccurate allegations that go back 10 years."
The officials who had predicted that Mr. Boyle would leave, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said today that they could only guess that he had changed his mind -- or that he might be postponing his departure for a face-saving interval, so that it would not appear that he was being forced out.
The Port Authority has been in turmoil recently, caught in a struggle between Mr. Pataki and Mrs. Whitman over how its spending should be divided between the two states. Because of that dispute, the agency has been unable to sign new contracts with the nation's two largest shipping companies, which have been threatening to move their operations to another port, a potential major loss to the region's economy.
Before taking over the Port Authority three years ago, Mr. Boyle was president of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, where he won praise for eliminating organized crime influences, streamlining operations and bringing new business to a moribund center. Similarly, he was credited with reversing the fortunes of Hudson Valley, turning a small failing hospital into a much larger economic success story.
But news reports have long raised questions about some business practices at the hospital, in which some board members' private businesses had dealings with the hospital.
Mr. Spitzer's civil lawsuit, filed in state Supreme Court in Manhattan, contends that many of those transactions violated the state's laws on the conduct of nonprofit corporations, and that the hospital failed to comply with laws requiring disclosure of those relationships to the attorney general's office. Most of those accusations involve Mr. Boyle, but the attorney general also accused two other board members of similar wrongdoing.
The most serious charge made in the suit contends that Mr. Boyle committed fraud by disguising from the hospital his role in a real estate deal in the early 1990's. Mr. Spitzer contends that Mr. Boyle was a secret partner in a real estate company that leased a building to the hospital, then sold it to the hospital two years later, at a profit of $550,000.

HEADLINE: THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE VICE PRESIDENT;
Gore Says Bush Plan Is 'Economic Snake Oil'

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16

 BODY:
Wasting no time in sharpening his knives against Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Vice President Al Gore today ridiculed Mr. Bush for proposing an economic plan laced with "economic snake oil," a plan with a tax cut that Mr. Gore said was so reckless even the Republicans in Congress had better sense than consider it.
"Governor Bush's tax scheme is so risky, so reckless, that just yesterday the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, given an opportunity to vote for it, turned it down, turned the other way, said we don't want to even cast a vote on that thing," Mr. Gore said. "They came up with some gyrations to avoid having to vote on it." 
 In a day of campaigning around Washington, Mr. Gore also escalated the administration's battle with the National Rifle Association and what he described as the Republican "lackeys" in Congress who do its bidding. In a speech to the Consumer Federation of America -- an event that his office billed as official rather than political because Mr. Gore had been invited in his capacity as vice president -- Mr. Gore raised the issue of gun control.
Referring to earlier comments by Wayne LaPierre, the association's executive vice president, that President Clinton and Mr. Gore were willing to accept a certain level of killing to further their political agenda, Mr. Gore said, "Those kind of comments are shameful and they're wrong."
Noting that the Republican leadership had refused for eight months to allow a conference committee between the House and Senate to meet to discuss gun control proposed in one of the two chambers' juvenile crime bills, Mr. Gore added: "What we don't need is more violent rhetoric from those whose policies do nothing to stop gun violence and indeed are designed to paralyze efforts such as those as would take place in this conference committee if the N.R.A. would allow its legislative lackeys to meet, to permit the conference to meet."
Mr. Gore also leaped at the opportunity today to ridicule Mr. Bush for failing to heed any lessons from Senator John McCain, who has suspended his presidential campaign against Mr. Bush. In an appearance before about 50 members of the Amalgamated Transit Union, Mr. Gore cited a Bush interview and said of him, "He even said in this morning's New York Times that he didn't learn a thing from John McCain in the Republican primaries and wasn't going to change anything whatsoever in an effort to reach out to McCain or to accommodate whatever he could have learned from John McCain."
