HEADLINE: Agreement on a Global Firewall, but Little Beyond That

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Meetings of finance ministers and central bankers here over the weekend started with a pledge by wealthy nations to significantly increase the lending capacity of the International Monetary Fund to defend against the possibility of worsening economic conditions in the debt-laden euro zone.
But they ended on Sunday without a consensus on just how to speed up the economic recovery, stamp out the European debt crisis or lower unemployment around the world, officials said. 
Heading into the meetings, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the monetary fund and a former French finance minister, had called for a ''Washington moment'' -- a shared sense of purpose about the magnitude of the challenges facing world leaders, and building momentum to tackle those challenges.
''I personally feel that that Washington moment was clearly in the room in the course of the meetings,'' she said at a news conference on Saturday.
But Pascal Lamy, the director general of the World Trade Organization, said participants seemed more concerned with political considerations and poll numbers at home than with international cooperation, yielding little progress on hard questions about fostering stable, inclusive growth.
''What's missing is a common road map,'' Mr. Lamy said in an interview. ''International cooperation is about doing things you don't want to do for the common good. But they're all focused on the short term.''
To be sure, the additional $430 billion in lending capacity contributed by developed economies like Japan, Britain, Saudi Arabia and South Korea was seen as a major achievement. The contributions came after I.M.F. economists determined that countries around the world might require up to $1 trillion in new loans because of the combined effects of the sovereign debt crisis in Europe and sluggish global economic growth. The I.M.F. agreed to raise about half that amount if Europe would raise the other half.
But finance ministers are still at odds over the effect of debt reduction on economic growth.
Many governments, particularly in Europe, believe that indebted advanced economies need to cut their budgets to maintain stability in the financial system.
''Fiscal sustainability in the United States and Japan weigh on the domestic and global outlook and require clearly spelled out consolidation strategies to reduce the risk of a sudden loss of market confidence,'' Jan Kees de Jager, the Dutch finance minister, said at an I.M.F. committee meeting on Saturday.
The fund itself, however, warned that austerity could be self-defeating, undercutting growth without satisfying skittish investors in the credit markets.
''Countries were pretty divided'' about the appropriate pace of fiscal consolidation, Guido Mantega, the Brazilian finance minister, told reporters, according to Reuters.
''European countries mostly believe that you just need to carry on the fiscal consolidation and economies will adjust,'' he said. ''But the I.M.F. showed a worrisome picture'' if too many countries cut too fast.
Robert B. Zoellick, the outgoing president of the World Bank, echoed those concerns in an interview. ''Macroeconomic stabilization, both in fiscal and monetary policies, is necessary but not sufficient,'' he said, calling for more attention to the ''equally important and under-recognized'' issue of reforms for stable, long-term growth.
Nor was the I.M.F. fund-raising accomplished without dissent. Although a dozen countries came forward to join the euro zone in pledging money, there remained differing opinions on what the new pledges meant and how they should be used, and many countries remained on the sidelines.
Canada, for instance, declined to contribute new money to the fund, arguing that Europe had more than enough money to handle its own sovereign debt crisis. ''They need to step up to the plate and overwhelm this issue with their own resources,'' Jim Flaherty, the Canadian finance minister, told reporters.
The United States also chose not to contribute to the I.M.F., though officials said that Washington supported the efforts to bolster the fund as long as Europe was playing the dominant role in preventing speculative attacks on European sovereign debt and stabilizing the Continent's financial system.
''The success of the next phase of the crisis response will hinge on Europe's willingness and ability, together with the European Central Bank, to apply its tools and processes creatively, flexibly and aggressively,'' Timothy F. Geithner, the Treasury secretary, said at an I.M.F. meeting on Saturday.
Some European leaders bristled last week at the suggestion -- made as rising yields in Spain spurred worries that the country would need a bailout, like Greece, Portugal and Ireland before it -- that they had not tackled the crisis with sufficient force.
''I'm always surprised when I read that Europe has not done enough,'' Klaus Regling, the chief executive of the European Financial Stability Facility, a temporary bailout fund, said at an event hosted by the European Institute on Friday.
The I.M.F.'s financing drive has also been met with raised eyebrows from the cash-rich, fast-growing emerging economies that were expected to provide much of the new money. That expectation raised the thorny question of whether Brazilian farmers and Chinese laborers should be called on to help finance the debt of Italian office workers and Spanish retirees, especially if those developing nations would not win more voting power within the fund for doing so.
The biggest and most powerful emerging economies -- Brazil, China, India and Russia -- said they would contribute to the fund. But they declined to specify how much.
Mr. Mantega, the Brazilian finance minister, castigated the I.M.F. for being slow to initiate reforms agreed to two years ago that would reduce the voting power of Europe relative to big emerging economies. He said that the delay had been ''deeply damaging to this institution'' and called for voting to be strictly proportionate to countries' economic output.
''Brazil's economy is larger than that of any European country but Germany and France,'' Mr. Mantega said. ''Yet Brazil's calculated quota share is equivalent to that of the Netherlands and smaller than those of Spain, Italy and the United Kingdom.''
On Sunday, Ms. Lagarde announced that she now planned to focus on raising about $17 billion for the I.M.F.'s poverty reduction and growth facility, which offers low-cost development loans to poor countries.

HEADLINE: Shift on Executive Power Lets Obama Bypass Rivals

BYLINE: By CHARLIE SAVAGE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- One Saturday last fall, President Obama interrupted a White House strategy meeting to raise an issue not on the agenda. He declared, aides recalled, that the administration needed to more aggressively use executive power to govern in the face of Congressional obstructionism.
''We had been attempting to highlight the inability of Congress to do anything,'' recalled William M. Daley, who was the White House chief of staff at the time. ''The president expressed frustration, saying we have got to scour everything and push the envelope in finding things we can do on our own.''
For Mr. Obama, that meeting was a turning point. As a senator and presidential candidate, he had criticized George W. Bush for flouting the role of Congress. And during his first two years in the White House, when Democrats controlled Congress, Mr. Obama largely worked through the legislative process to achieve his domestic policy goals.
But increasingly in recent months, the administration has been seeking ways to act without Congress. Branding its unilateral efforts ''We Can't Wait,'' a slogan that aides said Mr. Obama coined at that strategy meeting, the White House has rolled out dozens of new policies -- on creating jobs for veterans, preventing drug shortages, raising fuel economy standards, curbing domestic violence and more. 
Each time, Mr. Obama has emphasized the fact that he is bypassing lawmakers. When he announced a cut in refinancing fees for federally insured mortgages last month, for example, he said: ''If Congress refuses to act, I've said that I'll continue to do everything in my power to act without them.''
Aides say many more such moves are coming. Not just a short-term shift in governing style and a re-election strategy, Mr. Obama's increasingly assertive use of executive action could foreshadow pitched battles over the separation of powers in his second term, should he win and Republicans consolidate their power in Congress.
Many conservatives have denounced Mr. Obama's new approach. But William G. Howell, a University of Chicago political science professor and author of ''Power Without Persuasion: The Politics of Direct Presidential Action,'' said Mr. Obama's use of executive power to advance domestic policies that could not pass Congress was not new historically. Still, he said, because of Mr. Obama's past as a critic of executive unilateralism, his transformation is remarkable.
''What is surprising is that he is coming around to responding to the incentives that are built into the institution of the presidency,'' Mr. Howell said. ''Even someone who has studied the Constitution and holds it in high regard -- he, too, is going to exercise these unilateral powers because his long-term legacy and his standing in the polls crucially depend upon action.''
Mr. Obama has issued signing statements claiming a right to bypass a handful of constraints -- rejecting as unconstitutional Congress's attempt to prevent him from having White House ''czars'' on certain issues, for example. But for the most part, Mr. Obama's increased unilateralism in domestic policy has relied on a different form of executive power than the sort that had led to heated debates during his predecessor's administration: Mr. Bush's frequent assertion of a right to override statutes on matters like surveillance and torture.
''Obama's not saying he has the right to defy a Congressional statute,'' said Richard H. Pildes, a New York University law professor. ''But if the legislative path is blocked and he otherwise has the legal authority to issue an executive order on an issue, they are clearly much more willing to do that now than two years ago.''
The Obama administration started down this path soon after Republicans took over the House of Representatives last year. In February 2011, Mr. Obama directed the Justice Department to stop defending the Defense of Marriage Act, which bars federal recognition of same-sex marriages, against constitutional challenges. Previously, the administration had urged lawmakers to repeal it, but had defended their right to enact it.
In the following months, the administration increased efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions through environmental regulations, gave states waivers from federal mandates if they agreed to education overhauls, and refocused deportation policy in a way that in effect granted relief to some illegal immigrants brought to the country as children. Each step substituted for a faltered legislative proposal.
But those moves were isolated and cut against the administration's broader political messaging strategy at the time: that Mr. Obama was trying to reach across the aisle to get things done. It was only after the summer, when negotiations over a deficit reduction deal broke down and House Republicans nearly failed to raise the nation's borrowing limit, that Mr. Obama fully shifted course.
First, he proposed a jobs package and gave speeches urging lawmakers to ''pass this bill'' -- knowing they would not. A few weeks later, at the policy and campaign strategy meeting in the White House's Roosevelt Room, the president told aides that highlighting Congressional gridlock was not enough.
''He wanted to continue down the path of being bold with Congress and flexing our muscle a little bit, and showing a contrast to the American people of a Congress that was completely stuck,'' said Nancy-Ann DeParle, a deputy chief of staff assigned to lead the effort to come up with ideas.
Ms. DeParle met twice a week with members of the domestic policy council to brainstorm. She met with cabinet secretaries in the fall, and again in February with their chiefs of staff. No one opposed doing more; the challenge was coming up with workable ideas, aides said.
The focus, said Dan Pfeiffer, the White House communications director, was ''what we could do on our own to help the economy in areas Congress was failing to act,'' so the list was not necessarily the highest priority actions, but instead steps that did not require legislation.
Republican lawmakers watched warily. One of Mr. Obama's first ''We Can't Wait'' announcements was the moving up of plans to ease terms on student loans. After Republican complaints that the executive branch had no authority to change the timing, it appeared to back off.
The sharpest legal criticism, however, came in January after Mr. Obama bypassed the Senate confirmation process to install four officials using his recess appointment powers, even though House Republicans had been forcing the Senate to hold ''pro forma'' sessions through its winter break to block such appointments.
Mr. Obama declared the sessions a sham, saying the Senate was really in the midst of a lengthy recess. His appointments are facing a legal challenge, and some liberals and many conservatives have warned that he set a dangerous precedent.
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Senate Democratic leader, who essentially invented the pro forma session tactic late in Mr. Bush's presidency, has not objected, however. Senate aides said Mr. Reid had told the White House that he would not oppose such appointments based on a memorandum from his counsel, Serena Hoy. She concluded that the longer the tactic went unchallenged, the harder it would be for any president to make recess appointments -- a significant shift in the historic balance of power between the branches.
The White House counsel, Kathryn Ruemmler, said the Obama administration's legal team had begun examining the issue in early 2011 -- including an internal Bush administration memo criticizing the notion that such sessions could block a president's recess powers -- and ''seriously considered'' making some appointments during Congress's August break. But Mr. Obama decided to move ahead in January 2012, including installing Richard Cordray to head the new consumer financial protection bureau, after Senate Republicans blocked a confirmation vote.
''I refuse to take 'no' for an answer,'' Mr. Obama declared, beneath a ''We Can't Wait'' banner. ''When Congress refuses to act and -- as a result -- hurts our economy and puts people at risk, I have an obligation as president to do what I can without them.''
The unilateralist strategy carries political risks. Mr. Obama cannot blame the Republicans when he adopts policies that liberals oppose, like when he overruled the Environmental Protection Agency's proposal to strengthen antismog rules or decided not to sign an order banning discrimination by federal contractors based on sexual orientation.
The approach also exposes Mr. Obama to accusations that he is concentrating too much power in the White House. Earlier this year, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, delivered a series of floor speeches accusing Mr. Obama of acting ''more and more like a king that the Constitution was designed to replace'' and imploring colleagues of both parties to push back against his ''power grabs.''
But Democratic lawmakers have been largely quiet; many of them accuse Republicans of engaging in an unprecedented level of obstructionism and say that Mr. Obama has to do what he can to make the government work. The pattern adds to a bipartisan history in which lawmakers from presidents' own parties have tended not to object to invocations of executive power.
For their part, Republicans appear to have largely acquiesced. Mr. Grassley said in an interview that his colleagues were reluctant to block even more bills and nominations in response to Mr. Obama's ''chutzpah,'' lest they play into his effort to portray them as making Congress dysfunctional.
''Some of the most conservative people in our caucus would adamantly disagree with what Obama did on recess appointments, but they said it's not a winner for us,'' he said.
Mr. Obama's new approach puts him in the company of his recent predecessors. Mr. Bush, for example, failed to persuade Congress to pass a bill allowing religiously affiliated groups to receive taxpayer grants -- and then issued an executive order making the change.
President Bill Clinton increased White House involvement in agency rule making, using regulations and executive orders to show that he was getting things done despite opposition from a Republican Congress on matters like land conservation, gun control, tobacco advertising and treaties. (He was assisted by a White House lawyer, Elena Kagan, who later won tenure at Harvard based on scholarship analyzing such efforts and who is now on the Supreme Court.)
And both the Reagan and George Bush administrations increased their control over executive agencies to advance a deregulatory agenda, despite opposition from Democratic lawmakers, while also developing legal theories and tactics to increase executive power, like issuing signing statements more frequently.
The bipartisan history of executive aggrandizement in recent decades complicates Republican criticism. In February, two conservative advocacy groups -- Crossroads GPS and the American Action Network -- sponsored a symposium to discuss what they called ''the unprecedented expansion of executive power during the past three years.'' It reached an awkward moment during a talk with a former attorney general, Edwin Meese III, and a former White House counsel, C. Boyden Gray.
''It's kind of ironic you have Boyden and me here because when we were with the executive branch, we were probably the principal proponents of executive power under President Reagan and then President George H. W. Bush,'' Mr. Meese said, quickly adding that the presidential prerogatives they sought to protect, unlike Mr. Obama's, were valid.
But Jack L. Goldsmith, a Harvard law professor who led the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel during the George W. Bush administration, said the Obama administration's pattern reflects how presidents usually behave, especially during divided government, and appears aggressive only in comparison to Mr. Obama's having been ''really skittish for the first two years'' about executive power.
''This is what presidents do,'' Mr. Goldsmith said. ''It's taken Obama two years to get there, but this has happened throughout history. You can't be in that office with all its enormous responsibilities -- when things don't happen, you get blamed for it -- and not exercise all the powers that have accrued to it over time.''
A Measure of Change: This is the second article in a series assessing President Obama's record.

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: Unilateralist Strategy: President Obama has increasingly sought to achieve his domestic policy agenda through executive power rather than legislative action. Here are some examples: Litigation strategy: The Justice Department told courts that the Defense of Marriage Act, which bars federal recognition of same-sex marriages, is unconstitutional. The administration had previously defended it in court while urging Congress to repeal it.
Regulations: The Environmental Protection Agency has increased efforts to curb greenhouse gas emissions through new regulations on power plants, invoking its authority to control air pollution under the Clean Air Act. The administration had previously urged Congress to pass a cap and trade bill to limit carbon dioxide emissions. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY LUKE SHARRETT/THE NEW YORK TIMES)
Prosecutorial discretion: The Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency said it would focus on deporting illegal immigrants who had committed crimes, effectively granting relief to people who were brought to the country as children and had committed no other offense. The administration had supported legislation, the Dream Act, to achieve similar results. (PHOTOGRAPH BY JIM WILSON/THE NEW YORK TIMES)
Waivers: The Department of Education granted waivers from mandates of the No Child Left Behind law, seen as increasingly unrealistic, to states that agreed to overhaul their education policies in line with the administration's preferences. The law included a provision allowing such waivers. (PHOTOGRAPH BY CHARLES DHARAPAK/ASSOCIATED PRESS)
Signing statements: While Mr. Obama has challenged far fewer laws using signing statements than did his predecessor, George W. Bush, he has still occasionally reserved a constitutional right to bypass a provision in a bill he was signing. Among them, he has objected to provisions barring him from having White House ''czars'' on certain issues. (PHOTOGRAPH BY ANDREW HARRER/BLOOMBERG NEWS)
Executive orders: Mr. Obama signed an executive order directing the Food and Drug Administration and the Department of Justice to take action to prevent shortages of certain prescription drugs. Because Congress has not passed a similar bill, however, the steps remain voluntary for drug companies. (PHOTOGRAPH BY DOUG MILLS/THE NEW YORK TIMES)
 Recess appointments: Mr. Obama unilaterally installed a director of the new consumer financial protection agency during lawmakers' winter vacation. Congress attempted to block appointments during the recess by holding ''pro forma'' sessions in which a senator went into the empty chamber every three days to bang the gavel. The White House said such sessions were a sham. (PHOTOGRAPH BY J. SCOTT APPLEWHITE/ASSOCIATED PRESS) (A12)

HEADLINE: In Presidential Race's Give-and-Take, Hope for a Fiscal Compromise

BYLINE: By JOHN HARWOOD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When television pundits and aging rock stars start commanding headlines in the presidential campaign, it is tempting to conclude that the election season will merely produce a long, painful case of cat scratch fever.
But beneath the campaign noise, some elected officials and policy experts see improving odds for 2012 to end up yielding much more, including progress toward a deal on tax and budget issues that have confounded Washington's divided government. Some say the campaign dialogue could even bring a deal closer.
The optimists include leading stakeholders in Washington's oft-spurned centrist boutique, which may be especially vulnerable to wishful analysis. But two looming events -- an automatic $1.2 trillion budget ''sequester'' hitting defense and domestic spending, and the expiration of all of President George W. Bush's tax cuts -- will create pressure for the two parties to strike a compromise. 
''The probability of a deal strikes me as pretty high, since no agreement would be such a disaster,'' said Peter R. Orszag, President Obama's former budget director.
Steve Bell, a longtime Senate Republican budget aide now at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said the White House and Congress ''will not allow the sequester to occur and all the Bush tax cuts to expire. They're going to be looking at each other on Nov. 20 and saying, 'Well, what do you want to do?' ''
As for heated exchanges by the candidates and their allies between now and then, Mr. Bell added, ''The debate itself is going to prepare the way for a breakthrough.''
The potential breakthrough in question is the sort that the Simpson-Bowles commission proposed in 2010: roughly $4 trillion in deficit reduction over 10 years in a compromise requiring Republicans to accept tax increases and Democrats big changes in Medicare and other entitlement programs.
Mr. Obama, Speaker John A. Boehner of the House and a bipartisan group of six senators sought unsuccessfully to strike such a deal in 2011. But Senator Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, one of those six, said that he was more optimistic now about action in a lame duck session of Congress, the opening months of the new Congress in 2013, or both.
Mr. Warner cited praise for parts of the Simpson-Bowles plan from Mr. Obama and Mitt Romney, the likely Republican presidential nominee, and signs of weakening Republican opposition to tax increases.
Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, a member of the Finance Committee, recently urged fellow Republicans to accept Democrats' demand for some tax increases, as long as Democrats accepted the longstanding argument by conservatives that revenue calculations account for at least some positive effect on economic growth from changes in the tax code.
Republicans have taken encouragement from the decision by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, to join the chairman of the House Budget Committee, Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, in backing an overhaul of Medicare using ''premium support'' subsidies for beneficiaries who buy private insurance.
The plan would give beneficiaries the option of remaining in traditional Medicare, and it calls for larger subsidies than Mr. Ryan's earlier Medicare proposal, which Mr. Obama skewered as a voucher plan to cut government spending at the expense of the elderly.
Some moderate Democratic senators chided Mr. Wyden for joining Mr. Ryan, but ''the objection wasn't to the policy,'' Mr. Bell said. ''It was to the timing'' amid the election campaign.
A growing group of Senate Democrats is concluding that overhauling Medicare through a premium support option ''makes an awful lot of sense,'' said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Mr. Romney's proposal for Medicare mirrors the Ryan-Wyden plan.
That leaves plenty of room for the two candidates to attack each other harshly until Election Day. Mr. Romney accuses the president and his party of resisting needed changes in Medicare and other entitlement programs; Mr. Obama insists that Mr. Romney's opposition to any tax hikes would eviscerate vital government functions.
Advocates of a Simpson-Bowles-style deal say both are right. And their campaign arguments, Mr. Bell said, could help prepare the public for a compromise as long as the candidates preserve some room for postelection maneuvering.
Mr. Warner said: ''Both the candidates might actually realize it's in their self-interest to till some of this ground. My hope is that a little more rationality will prevail.''
There remains ample reason for caution. The Simpson-Bowles plan was defeated overwhelmingly last month when offered as an alternative in the House budget debate.
Senator Kent Conrad, a Democrat from North Dakota who is retiring, has put the Simpson-Bowles plan in front of the Budget Committee, which he leads. ''I'm hopeful,'' he said, that something like it can be enacted, though probably after the election.
Former Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire, a Republican who served on the Budget Committee, said the ''working center in the Senate'' remained the foremost reason to expect a compromise. But he doubted that Mr. Obama would accept the scale of change in Medicare that Republicans would require to accept tax increases.
''Everything's in place except the president,'' Mr. Gregg said.
Mr. Orszag said his former boss wanted a deal, but he noted the risk that each side could miscalculate the other's bottom line.
Yet even Mr. Ryan, who has absorbed more blows from Democrats over the budget than any other Republican, predicted, ''We'll get a deal in 2013 because we have to.''
''There are multiple factors that could come up and cause this to fall apart,'' said Ms. MacGuineas of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. ''But there's one factor that keeps it together: Everyone knows it has to happen.''
Whether Mr. Obama or Mr. Romney wins in November, ''nobody should want to govern without this deal,'' she said. ''It frees space and time for the other parts of their agenda -- besides having to save $5 trillion.''

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article misstated the amount of money that Maya MacGuineas said the winner of the November presidential election would have to worry about saving. It is $5 trillion, not $5 billion.

HEADLINE: The Arms Race Myth

BYLINE: SHASHANK JOSHI


HIGHLIGHT: Visions of an arms race are "alarmist," the author says. 

 BODY:
The test last Thursday of the Agni 5, India's first missile capable of striking any part of China, was met with something approaching hysteria in the national media. The normally sober Hindu noted how the missile "lifted off majestically," and the Hindustan cheered "Jai Hind" (hail India!).
Perhaps irked by this jingoism, the state-run Chinese media mocked the Agni as a "dwarf," and warned that, "for the foreseeable future, India would stand no chance in an overall arms race with China." It's fast becoming received wisdom that such a competition is underway. The New York Times, like others, reported the Agni's test as "the latest escalation of an arms race in Asia."
The problem is that this term is being thrown around too loosely. It is fair to say that China's expanding economic and military power has spooked its neighbors, many of whom are now moving closer to the United States or modernizing their own military. But India's test of the Agni 5 was less about a race than about playing catch-up.
India's political and military leaders understand that they cannot sustain a true arms race with China. Arms races occur when rivals try and outdo each other for more or better weapons, in the belief that small relative advantages make big differences to security.
China's economy is about three to four times larger than that of India, and China spends around three times as much as India on arms. A decade from now, China will field more advanced fourth-generation combat aircraft than the total number of aircraft in the Indian Air Force.
Given India's slowing growth rate and the sheer scale of the gap with China, India has no choice but to accept its relative disadvantage and focus on mitigating some of its own vulnerabilities.
In the context of its border dispute with China, which has flared up since 2005, and the strategic competition around the Indian Ocean, India is taking steps to counter a growing Chinese presence. China is not especially worried about what India is doing, nor taking military countermeasures.
The Agni 5, of course, is more provocative because it is a nuclear missile aimed at China. Yet there, too, the gap between China and India is yawning. China has up to 90 deployed intercontinental ballistic missiles - India has none.
India and China have both long held to a doctrine of "minimum deterrence." Delhi and Beijing - unlike, say, Pakistan or the United States - view nuclear weapons strictly as tools for deterrence, only to be used in response to a nuclear strike. That requires nothing more than "second-strike" capability.
Before the Agni 5, India did not have ballistic missiles with the range to make a "second strike" attack against China's most important cities, Beijing and Shanghai. Now it does, which means the development of the Agni 5 jibes perfectly with India's minimum-deterrence ethos.
True, India has doubled the size of its nuclear arsenal over the past decade. But, despite its pretensions to great power status, India has been relaxed about having fewer weapons than Pakistan. Pakistan has leapt ahead, both in terms of the types and numbers of its nuclear weapons. But that isn't a race - it's a lonely sprint.
As the Manhattan Project's director, J. Robert Oppenheimer, noted, "our twenty-thousandth bomb" will not "in any deep strategic sense affect their two-thousandth."
Of the Agni 5, the Hindustan Times' foreign editor, Pramit Pal Chaudhuri, estimates that India will add, "at best, two such missiles to its arsenal every year." This will have virtually zero impact on China's retaliatory capacity. There is, therefore, no reason to suppose that Beijing will scramble to respond in the way that Washington and Moscow would have done in response to one another.
Under these conditions, having more survivable and robust means of retaliation, like the Agni 5, can be stabilizing. Such missiles can be moved around by road or rail, which makes them less vulnerable than those in fixed silos. This enables India to shift away from less reliable and more trigger-happy delivery systems like aircraft. The more confident India feels in its ability to respond, the calmer it can be in handling crises.
Of course, sobriety and stability are not guaranteed. China has understandable concerns about developments that could blunt its retaliatory capacity. One example is missile shields, which both India and other Asian counties are exploring. Another is MIRV technology that could be fitted to the Agni missiles. MIRVs refer to multiple accurate warheads that fit onto a single missile. India does not need them for deterrence, and they could slightly heighten China's fears that its own weapons might be wiped out before they get off the ground.
An open and sustained Sino-Indian conversation over such issues is necessary. But dark visions of arms races are alarmist, at a time when the Asian strategic balance is in quite enough flux.

HEADLINE: Part 1: Answers to Readers' Questions on Financial Aid

BYLINE: MARK KANTROWITZ


HIGHLIGHT: This week's first installment of expert financial aid advice from Mark Kantrowitz, the publisher of FinAid.org and FastWeb.com. 

 BODY:
Mark Kantrowitz, the financial aid expert and publisher of FastWeb.com and FinAid.org, is spending a week with The Choice to answer your questions about scholarships, loans and financial aid offers from colleges.
Mr. Kantrowitz is the author of "Secrets to Winning a Scholarship," published in 2011, and has helped several readers of The Choice navigate the Free Application for Federal Student Aid during his Fafsa Q. and A. series in January.
To submit a question to Mr. Kantrowitz, please use the comment box in our original post or the one below. His answers are scheduled to continue throughout the week.
Questions and answers have been edited, including for space and style. - Tanya Caldwell
Q.
What I've been reading about possible changes in federal aid - the elimination of Pell Grants, the doubling of Stafford loan interest rates, etc. - has me up worrying at night. Is there a way for parents to interpret current financial aid award letters with future changes in mind?
-Sleepless in NY
A.
Just as net price calculators provide estimates that may not be predictive of the financial aid award letter, financial aid award letters may differ from the final bursar's bill. This is especially true at public colleges, where state legislatures may cut appropriations midyear. Few colleges have the financial resources to replace shortfalls in federal and state financial aid and appropriations.
Even if the financial aid award letter is accurate, it provides college cost and financial aid information for just one year. College costs during a student's senior year in college are likely to be at least one-fifth higher than during the freshman year in college.
This decade will be marked by severe declines in college affordability. The prospects for future cuts in higher education are high, with a funding shortfall of at least $10 billion a year in the Pell Grant program in 2013-14 and subsequent years. State budgets will continue to feel pressure from lower income tax revenue due to sluggish improvements in unemployment rates for the next two to three years, forcing additional above-average increases in public college tuition rates.
There are many proposals on the table, and the main difference is in the severity of the cuts. Few legislators are proposing increases in student aid funding. In his State of the Union address, President Obama called on Congress to make the American Opportunity Tax Credit permanent and to delay the doubling of the interest rate on undergraduate subsidized Stafford loans by a year. The maximum Pell Grant will increase by only $85 in 2013-14, from $5,550 to $5,635, after two years of no increases. These proposals will be financed in part by increasing the interest rate on the Perkins loan program, eliminating the subsidized interest benefit, and increasing Perkins loan volume a year to $8.5 billion from $1 billion.
Since at least 2005, Congress has used efficiency improvements and savings in the student aid programs to reduce the budget deficit. Given the spending cuts and triggers mandated by the Budget Control Act of 2011, this will continue through 2020. The most likely targets for spending cuts include the elimination of subsidized interest on subsidized Stafford loans to undergraduate students, more cuts to the Pell Grant program, and the elimination of the Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grant and federal work-study programs.
Q.
Why does the Fafsa ask for parents to declare the value of retirement accounts while claiming that these are not counted against the expected family contribution?
-latexan
A.
The Free Application for Federal Student Aid considers several factors, including family income and assets, when calculating the expected family contribution (E.F.C.).
The Fafsa does not ask applicants to report the value of qualified retirement accounts as an . However, the form does require applicants to report the current year's voluntary contributions to retirement plans as .
The Fafsa also shelters a portion of other investments based on the age of the oldest parent. The asset protection allowance is the present cost of an annuity that would, at retirement, supplement Social Security retirement benefits to yield a moderate family income.
The philosophy behind need analysis involves assessing a portion of the family's discretionary income, which is what is left from total income after subtracting an allowance for basic living expenses and mandatory expenses like taxes. To the extent that the amount of retirement plan contributions are under the employee's discretionary control, they are considered to be part of total income. Since the Fafsa starts with the adjusted gross income (A.G.I.) as reported on the federal income tax return, it must add untaxed income, like retirement plan contributions, to arrive at total income.
The CSS/Financial Aid PROFILE form, on the other hand, does require families to report retirement plan assets. It compares the figures against an index based on the income and age of the parents.
Q.
Why does the Fafsa encourage adding parental information as part of the equation when a student is seeking a degree in a medical field?
-Juli Woods
A.
Students who are enrolled in medical school, law school or graduate school are automatically considered to be independent students, so parental information is not required on the Fafsa.
Supplying parental information will not affect the Expected Family Contribution, but it will make the data available to the colleges for awarding their own financial aid. In fact, many medical and law schools require parental information for awarding their own institutional aid, like grants and tuition waivers. Some medical schools also use the parental information for awarding federal Perkins loans, which are intended for students with exceptional financial need. Federal student aid for medical school students consists mostly of the unsubsidized Stafford and Grad PLUS loans.
Since most medical school students demonstrate financial need and the college's need-based grants are limited (about 9 percent of total aid, including loans), many medical schools ask for parental information to help differentiate among the students.
Q.
Can you provide some guidance for Commended National Merit scholars? Since the Ivies and elite schools don't offer anything for National Merit Scholarship Program, should you list two schools that are your safety schools? I'm guessing that elite schools don't care that you don't list them. I'm really having a hard time seeing the value in the program, other than the title.
-Kiley Athanasiou
A.
There are two main benefits to recognition in the National Merit Scholarship competition. One benefit is the addition of a line on the student's rsum, which may help the student get into college. The other benefit is scholarship money to help pay for college.
Commended students and semifinalists are among the top 50,000 high scorers on the PSAT/NMSQT out of about 1.5 million applicants. Only the 15,000 semifinalists who advance to finalist status can compete for more than 8,000 National Merit Scholarships.
Students who are recognized by a Letter of Commendation do not receive National Merit Scholarships, but may be candidates for 1,300 special scholarships awarded by corporations and businesses. They may also be able to qualify for academic scholarships awarded by less competitive colleges to students with high test scores.
Since the student can list his or her National Merit status on the application for admission, there isn't any benefit to picking elite colleges as the two colleges that will receive the referral from the National Merit Scholarship Corporation. Instead, pick two colleges that offer academic scholarships.

HEADLINE: With Darvish, Rangers Refused to Generalize

BYLINE: TYLER KEPNER


HIGHLIGHT: The Rangers bet $107.7 million that Yu Darvish would be better than previous Japanese pitchers who have not matched their hype. 

 BODY:
In signing Yu Darvish, who starts against the Yankees on Tuesday, Texas Rangers General Manager Jon Daniels had to look past the disappointments other teams have experienced with Japanese pitchers.
The Yankees were burned by giving big money to Hideki Irabu and Kei Igawa; Hiroki Kuroda, who opposes Darvish on Tuesday, is on a one-year deal. And while Daisuke Matsuzaka helped Boston win the 2007 World Series, he has contributed little since going 18-3 in 2008. Wisely, it seems, Daniels and his staff refused to generalize and evaluated Darvish on his own merits.
"Listen, they're all individual guys," Daniels said last week. "A lot of people were skeptical and tried to broad-brush Japanese pitchers, but that mind-set doesn't work.
"If you said, 'Well, don't draft a high-school right-hander in the first round' -- all right, then you don't have Roy Halladay and you don't have Matt Cain. Or, 'You can't take a high school catcher in the first round' -- then you don't have Joe Mauer and you don't have Brian McCann. That mind-set doesn't work. It's about the individual."
The Rangers bid $51.7 million for the negotiating rights to Darvish, then signed him for six years and $56 million. They still do not know the value of the next-closest bid. The difference between the figures, of course, would be wasted money for Texas. But that was not important.
"We said, 'Here's how we evaluate him, let's go to the top of our means, whatever we're willing to pay,'" Daniels said. "It was not about getting the best possible deal. It was about getting the player. And we had to be O.K. with that."
After three starts, the Rangers are pleased. They are the best team in the American League - again - and Darvish is 2-0 with a 3.57 earned run average. The Rangers expect him to keep improving as he learns to trust his stuff and economize his pitch count against deeper lineups than he faced in Japan. 
"My hope is he doesn't adjust too much and makes the league adjust to him, that he goes out and pitches his game and does what he's capable of doing," Daniels said. "There are obvious differences: the size of the hitters, the power in our game, the schedule, the ball, the elements. But at the same time, his stuff and his ability is good enough."

HEADLINE: Charles Colson, R.I.P.

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Why his prison ministry was a model for how Christians should engage with public affairs. 

 BODY:
I took the last week off from blogging and columnizing in order to do some promotion for my new book on American Christianity, "Bad Religion," and thus far one of the questions I've been asked most frequently involves the proper relationship between Christian faith and politics. In the book, I simultaneously argue that the corrupting influence of partisanship (on both the religious left and religious right) helps explain at least some of institutional Christianity's post-1960s decline, that Christians cannot simply be apolitical and leave partisan controversies alone, which would seem like the obvious way to avoid such corruption entirely. Which raises the obvious follow-up: Well, what would a healthier Christian engagement with political issues look like?
One possible answer is suggested by the post-Watergate career of the former Nixon aide and "hatchet man" Charles Colson, dead last Saturday at the age of 80. Colson ceased to play the explicit Republican activist after his mid-1970s conversion and jail sentence, but he was intensely active in what became known as the religious right across a variety of fronts (particularly in his work to unite Catholics and his fellow evangelicals on issues like abortion). On most questions, social and economic alike, he remained as much a reliable Republican as a Jerry Falwell or a Ralph Reed or any other figure like them.
Except that there was something that set the post-conversion Colson apart from the average G.O.P. partisan, and that was his zeal for prison ministry and penal reform, embodied by Prison Fellowship, the group that he founded after his own stint in behind bars. As David Plotz wrote in Slate some years ago:
... Prison Fellowship thrived, and Colson has become the nation's greatest prison reformer. Its 50,000 volunteers are active in the vast majority of American correctional institutions. Its pen pals correspond with 27,000 prisoners. More than 150,000 prisoners participate in its Bible studies and seminars every year. Prison Fellowship publishes the most widely distributed prison newspaper, provides post-release pastoring for thousands of ex-cons, and supplies Christmas gifts to hundreds of thousands of kids with a locked-up parent. Studies suggest that Prison Fellowship lowers recidivism.
Colson may be the inspiration of the joke, "A liberal is a conservative who's been to prison." On prison issues he insists that nonviolent criminals should not be jailed, that more convicts should be paroled, and that drug offenders should be treated rather than incarcerated. He works desperately to convince conservative lawmakers to reconsider their lock-'em-up views. Colson lobbies for better prison conditions. He champions "restorative justice," a promising notion now being tested all over the country. Restorative justice holds that crime is committed not against the state but against a victim and against God. In restorative justice, nonviolent criminals stay out of jail, remain in the community where they committed their crime, and work to support their families and pay restitution to the victim. Ideally, the criminal seeks reconciliation with the victim, too.
This work didn't make Colson a closet liberal by any stretch. (As Plotz noted, his ministry focused heavily on Christian conversion in ways that often made secular and non-Christian reformers uncomfortable.) But it distinguished him, on an issue of large and growing significance in American life, from many of the purer partisans on the political right. Like, say, the pro-life sentiments of Sargent Shriver (to choose a similarly admirable example from the Democratic side), Colson's prison work served as a kind of countersign -- a public reminder that his belief in the gospel of Jesus Christ shaped his public commitments rather than the other way around. And it suggests a possible answer to the question of how religious believers should comport themselves politically in a polarized age.
We only have two parties in America, and to be active in politics inevitably requires identifying with one more than the other, and probably becoming directly involved with one or the other as well. But given how unlikely it seems that a political party in a fallen world would have a platform that comports with God's intentions for human affairs, any serious Christian should assume that there are places where his or her party is getting some important issue wrong, or at the very least giving it insufficient attention. And just recognizing those places or issues is not enough: The Christian Republican or the Christian Democrat has the obligation to focus on them as well, to prioritize them and call attention to them even when it annoys or frustrates their co-partisans, in order to demonstrate where their ultimate loyalties really lie.
In his work on behalf of convicted felons, the least Republican constituency imaginable, Charles Colson did just that - and made it possible for other conservative Christians to do the same. May he rest in peace.

HEADLINE: Losing the Future: Gutting Science Training

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Facing draconian cuts in state funds, the University of Florida joins a host of public universities that have decided to dismantle their computer science departments. 

 BODY:
Last month I wrote about how state budget cuts were forcing public universities to raise tuition and cut programs. Some of the subjects most valuable for job and economic growth -- like engineering, computer science and health sciences -- have been most vulnerable, because they also happen to be among the most expensive to teach.
One new and especially high-profile example is the University of Florida, which this month announced a plan that would gut its Computer and Information Science and Engineering Department.
Last week, Gov. Rick Scott of Florida signed a law cutting higher education funds in the state by $300 million, according to localpapers. This follows cuts totaling $767 million over the previous five years, according to the Center for the Study of Education Policy at Illinois State University.
The University of Florida, the state's flagship school, has been hit particularly hard. In an opinion article in The Gainesville Sun, a former university administrator said this year would bring "$38 million in budget cuts, creating an accumulated reduction in state funding to U.F. of 30 percent, or $240 million, since 2006."
The university has responded to these cuts with tuition increases, although the Legislature has set ceilings on tuition that keep schools from fully offsetting the cutback in state support. This is true in many other states, too.
So the university, like others across the country, is making some draconian spending cuts.
These include eliminating all graduate and research activity in its computer science department. Some of the department's faculty will be scattered to other departments, and some will have their jobs converted to full-time teaching/advising positions with a much higher teaching burden. The school plans to cut the department's entire teaching-assistant budget.
Needless to say, many of the faculty members are expected to leave, and their innovation, ideas and research will go with them.
For context, Governor Scott made some controversial statements last October about favoring higher education that generates more job growth and economic activity because education is fundamentally a kind of investment in your work force.
"If I'm going to take money from a citizen to put into education, then I'm going to take that money to create jobs," he told The Sarasota Herald-Tribune. "So I want that money to go to degrees where people can get jobs in this state."
"Is it a vital interest of the state to have more anthropologists? I don't think so."

HEADLINE: Americans Remain Wary of the Stock Market, Survey Finds

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: Americans are beginning to feel more financially secure but remain wary of investing in the stock market, a survey finds. 

 BODY:
Americans may be starting to feel more financially secure, but many remain wary of investing in the stock market, a new poll from Bankrate.com finds.
About three fourths of those interviewed for Bankrate's Financial Security Index said they were less inclined to invest in the stock market than they were a year ago. (Those being paid more than $75,000 a year were more inclined to invest in stocks).
Princeton Survey Research Associates International surveyed 1,000 adults by telephone in early April. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4 percent.
The overall index rose to a new high of 99.9 (the previous high was 98.5, reached almost a year ago. Bankrate began its monthly financial security polling in December of 2010).
About a third of Americans surveyed for the index said their overall financial situation was better now than it was 12 months ago (compared to about a quarter saying it is now worse). Those under 50 were more likely to say they were better off.
Job security remains a weak spot, however, with just 20 percent saying they felt more secure in their employment than a year ago.
Greg McBride, senior financial analyst at Bankrate, attributed that to the "lackluster" job growth reported at the beginning of April, when the survey was conducted. "That seemed to resonate with consumers," he said.
Continued unease about jobs, as well as rising gas prices and the continuing debt crisis in Europe, could weigh on financial security heading into the summer, he said.
Are you leery of investing in the stock market? And are you feeling more secure about your finances, compared with a year ago?

HEADLINE: Talking With Your Fingers

BYLINE: JOHN MCWHORTER


HIGHLIGHT: E-mailing and texting are not writing at all. They are something altogether new: written conversation. 

 BODY:
The latest word on the street about English in America - always bad, it seems - is that the shaggy construction of texting and e-mail spells the death of formal writing. Yet the truth about English in America - always sunnier, in fact - is that the looseness and creativity of these new ways of writing are a sign of a new sophistication in our society. This becomes clear when we understand that in the proper sense, e-mail and texting are not writing at all.
Historical perspective is useful. Writing was only invented roughly 5,500 years ago with the emergence of cuneiform picture writing in Mesopotamia, what is now Iraq and parts of Iran, Syria and Turkey, whereas humanity arose a good 200,000 years ago, with language probably tracing back at least 50,000 years and most likely much further. According to one estimate, if Homo sapiens had existed for 24 hours, writing only came along after 11 p.m.
Thus spoken language is fundamental, while written language is an artifice. Not surprisingly, then, the earliest writing was based on the way people talk, and that meant short sentences with a direct logical throughline. Researchers have found that even educated people today speak in word packets of 7 to 10 words a pop.
Take one of the world's oldest literary texts, "The Epic of Gilgamesh," in which we see word packets more than what we would call elaborate prose. Ishtar says:
I will pull down the Gates of Hell itself,
Crush the doorposts and flatten the door,
And I will let the dead leave
And let the dead roam the earth
And they shall eat the living.
Early texts pattern this way worldwide: Homer, Middle English narratives and even the Hebrew Bible are similar. However, while speaking is largely subconscious and rapid, writing and reading are deliberate and slow. Over time, writers took advantage of this and started crafting tapeworm sentences of a kind rarely used in casual speech. Only in writing could phraseology like that in Edward Gibbon's "The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Volume 2" (1781) become common:
The whole engagement lasted above twelve hours; till the gradual retreat of the Persians was changed into a disorderly flight, of which the shameful example was given by the principal leader, and the Surenas himself. They were pursued to the gates of Ctesiphon; and the conquerors might have entered the dismayed city, if their general, Victor, who was dangerously wounded with an arrow, had not conjured them to desist from a rash attempt, which must be fatal, if it were not successful.
At this point, two forms of language coexist in societies: choppy speech and crafted prose. No ancient Roman spoke the way Virgil and Cicero wrote. Even today, only about 100 of the world's 6,000 languages are written much, and none of the 5,900 unwritten ones are spoken in Gibbonesque paragraphs.
In an earlier America, then, one could hear speeches like William Jennings Bryan's floridly oratorical, carefully written "Cross of Gold" speech given at the Democratic National Convention in 1896 ("You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns. You shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of gold!") while ordinary people spoke much as we do today. The more anthropologically minded novelists depicted them doing it, such as Sinclair Lewis's street urchins in "Main Street": "Hey, lemme'lone," "Quit, dog-gone you, looka what you went and done, you almost spilled my glass swater." Gibbon is a distant presence here.
Fast forward to today, when we newly confront writing that seems much like the chatter of these pre-World War I street toughs, in its economy, spontaneity and even vulgarity. There is a virtual cult of concision - OMG, LOL and such - and little interest in the niceties of Strunk & White on capitalization or punctuation. We think of the elegant letters even modestly educated Civil War soldiers wrote and wonder how we got from "I know I shall be thinking all the time 'If it was just my darling Loulie how different it would be' " to "C U later."
Yet the brevity, improvisation and in-the-moment quality of e-mails and texts are those grand old defining qualities of spoken language. Keyboard technology, allowing us to produce and receive written communication with unprecedented speed, allows something hitherto unknown to humanity: written conversation. In this sense, they are not "writing" in the sense we are accustomed to. They are fingered speech.
A sense that e-mail and texting are "poor writing" is analogous, then, to one that the Rolling Stones produce "bad music" because they don't use violas. Note that one cannot speak capital letters or punctuation. If we accept e-mail and texting as a new way of talking, then their casualness with matters of case and commas is not only expected but unexceptionable.
Even if we call this new usage a form of writing, we can see Anglophone societies as now having two kinds of writing. For formal contexts, there is the long-lined kind that requires schooling and practice to master. Then there is a more natural form paralleling the way we speak for informal contexts - which are, after all, most of our lives.
Many praise rap as democratic, in that performing it is accessible to people without access to musical instruments and formal training. Texting is the linguistic equivalent. Would we prefer the era when the standard for all writing, even to close friends and family, was the likes of McGuffey's Reader passages such as "The quail is peculiarly a domestic bird, and is attached to his birthplace and the home of his forefathers. The various members of the aquatic families educate their children in the cool summer of the far north, and bathe their warm bosoms in July "? 
E-mail and texting are also just plain handy, allowing the recipient more flexibility in answering, usable amidst noise and even allowing a medium of flirtation less invasive than a phone call but quicker than a letter.
The only other problem we might see in something both democratic and useful is that it will exterminate actual writing. However, there are no signs of this thus far. In 2009, the National Assessment of Education Performance found a third of American eighth graders - the ones texting madly right now - reading at or above basic proficiency, but crucially, this figure has changed little since 1992, except to rise somewhat. Just as humans can function in multiple languages, they can also function in multiple kinds of language. An analogy would be the vibrant foodie culture that has thrived and even flowered despite the spread of fast food.
Who among us really fears that future editions of this newspaper will be written in emoticons? Rather, a space has reopened in public language for the chunky, transparent, WYSIWYG quality of the earliest forms of writing, produced by people who had not yet internalized a sense that the flavor of casual language was best held back from the printed page.
This speech on paper is vibrant, creative and "real" in exactly the way that we celebrate in popular forms of music, art, dance and dress style. Few among us yearn for a world in which the only music is classical, the only dance is ballet and daily clothing requires corsets and waistcoats. As such, we might all embrace a brave new world where we can both write and talk with our fingers.

HEADLINE: Hitting the Beach in Bangladesh

BYLINE: BETTINA WASSENER


HIGHLIGHT: A visit to Cox's Bazar brings home the fact that Bangladesh, much like its flashier neighbors Thailand and Vietnam, is enjoying rapid economic growth. And though millions of Bangladeshis live in abject poverty, others have the cash to pay for some relaxation at this up-and-coming beachside destination. 

 BODY:
COX'S BAZAR, Bangladesh - It's not Hawaii, and it's not St.-Tropez. But Cox's Bazar is an up-and-coming beach resort, with lush vegetation and soaring property prices to match.
Located in southeastern Bangladesh, Cox's Bazar is miles away - physically and metaphorically - from the long-developed beaches of Thailand or Vietnam. There is no alcohol - at least, none is openly served - and bathers splash about while fully dressed.
But a visit here brings home the fact that Bangladesh, much like its flashier neighbors, is enjoying rapid economic growth. And even though millions of Bangladeshis live in abject poverty, many others have the cash to pay for some beachside relaxation.
Most visitors to Cox's Bazar are Bangladeshis: The country sees few foreign tourists, and business travelers mostly journey only to Dhaka, or perhaps the port city of Chittagong. Still, a visit here also shows that Bangladesh is slowly appearing on the radar screen of international tourism.
To be sure, for investors to really come flocking, Bangladesh will need to get its act together on a lot of things - power cuts and traffic gridlock, for example, along with the immigration queue at the airport, which is the slowest I have ever experienced.
Still, as I report in more detail in this article, some analysts now flag Bangladesh's potential as the "next China," or at least the "next Indonesia."
"The country is doing more than just keeping its head above water in terms of growth," said Herald van der Linde, an equities analyst at HSBC in Hong Kong, who, like me, thought the country deserved a closer look, and visited recently. "Bangladesh is an open, dynamic market, with plenty of room to grow."
Hotel companies clearly agree.
Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group opened a Radisson in Dhaka in 2006. It is planning to open two more in Cox's Bazar and another in Chittagong. Starwood, which already operates a Westin in Dhaka, is planning to add a Sheraton and a Le Mridien.
Accor of France is exploring several options for its entry into Bangladesh, including properties in Dhaka and in Chittagong.
In the town of Cox's Bazar, the flow of Bangladeshi tourists has brought untold riches and job opportunities, and seems to have made many people happy - for the moment.
However, there also are controversies over land allotments, as reported last month in The Daily Star. And concerns about the environmental impact of development were reported in the Daily Sun earlier this month.

HEADLINE: Mr. Smith Goes to Kutaisi

BYLINE: HALEY SWEETLAND EDWARDS


HIGHLIGHT: It's hard not to interpret the Georgian government's decision to move Parliament out of Tbilisi as a ploy to weaken the opposition during an election year. 

 BODY:
KUTAISI, Georgia - It took me more than three hours last Thursday to get from the center of Tbilisi, Georgia's capital and commercial and cultural hub, to the country's brand new Parliament building, a stadium-sized oyster-shell-shaped building enmeshed in steel netting. That's because the Georgian Parliament is being relocated to Kutaisi, this small country's second-largest city, some 150 miles west.
Parliament's official move, which was announced last summer, is expected to take place this year, perhaps as early as next month. The measure is ostensibly designed to encourage decentralization, relieve Tbilisi's strained infrastructure, provide an economic bolster for Kutaisi and symbolically connect the country's two historic halves. But it seems destined to further weaken Georgia's already-feeble legislative branch just as the country enters a period of electoral instability. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for October, and presidential elections, which could bring Georgia's first democratic transfer of power, are expected next year.

Bolivia, Myanmar, Nigeria and other countries have moved one or more branches of government out of their capital, relocated the capital itself or created more than one capital. These changes have often created bureaucratic and logistical nightmares as well as political tensions among provinces. Sometimes, as is suspected in the case of Georgia, the moves were a deliberate political ploy to weaken one region of the country, a certain branch of government or the political opposition.
Most Georgians have greeted this move with barely more than a collective shrug - just 51 percent favor it - according to a survey by the National Democratic Institute (pdf). Why? Some naysayers cite the unnecessary expense, and others worry about the practical challenges of traveling between Tbilisi and Kutaisi. The two cities are currently joined by a plodding six-hour train ride or a dangerous drive down what is mostly a two-lane highway overtaken by speeding semis, trundling farm equipment and meandering cows. (The government is working on building a new airport in Kutaisi and bolstering Tbilisi-Kutaisi flights.)
Other critics, including some Georgian opposition politicians, say there are nefarious motivations behind the measure. They accuse President Mikheil Saakashvili of banishing Parliament to the far west in order to further marginalize it and discourage popular protest movements like those that have occasionally convened in recent years in front of the legislative building in central Tbilisi. Saakashvili himself came to power during the Rose Revolution of 2003 after his supporters stormed Parliament.
It wouldn't be the first time a decision to relocate the legislature had been politically motivated. At the tail end of Augusto Pinochet's rule in 1990, the government of Chile moved Parliament out of Santiago, the epicenter of the country's commerce, culture and government, to Valparaiso, some 100 miles away. Although the move succeeded in bolstering Valparaiso's economy, it is now, after two decades' experience, largely considered to have been a mistake.
Peter Siavelis, the director of the Latin American and Latino Studies Program at Wake Forest University, told me by phone from Santiago last week that moving Chile's Parliament had done little to decentralize power and a lot to create inefficiencies, like time wasted and increased traveling costs for legislators shuttling between Santiago and Valparaiso.
"By moving the legislature away from the rest of the government, a forum for informal politics was taken away," he also said. This weakened Parliament. "If delegates can't just walk over to, say, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and say, 'Let's talk about this piece of legislation,' that has the effect of making them less influential."
In Georgia, where tensions between the ruling party and the opposition have reached a seething crescendo this election year, it's hard to look at the decision to relocate Parliament without suspicion. It's simply too difficult to see how the move could help Georgia's tottering democracy develop what it needs most: robust institutions and more diverse representation in government.

HEADLINE: 'First Responders' Might Have Second Thoughts on Myanmar

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: The first public confrontation between democrats and the government of Myanmar since the election has raised the question of whether the West has been too quick to roll back political and economic sanctions. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - The first public confrontation between the democrats led by Aung San Suu Kyi and the Myanmar government began to play out on Monday as newly elected members of Parliament refused to take the official oath of office. 
The new lawmakers want to tweak the wording of the oath, but the nominally civilian government has refused to blink, which suggests that more conservative elements in the country could be putting the reformist tendencies of President Thein Sein in jeopardy.
The democrats, after having created the standoff, played down its severity on Monday, saying they expect some sort of resolution soon. 
But the issue might well give pause to Britain, the United States and other "first responders" that have already begun relaxing their political and economic sanctions against the former Burma. Japan, for example, agreed last weekend toforgive $3.7 billion in overdue loans while holding out the possibility of new assistance. 
The most nagging question now seems to be: Have foreign governments perhaps rushed to judgment on Myanmar, rolling back their sanctions too quickly? And this: Have the former generals and other hard-liners who have burrowed into the government finally had enough of reforms, democracy and the star power of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi?
Washington, in particular, could quickly halt the easing of its most punitive sanctions - after taking direction from Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, of course. Some aid and development projects have already been greenlighted, but an ambassador has yet to be nominated, and the principal legislation covering sanctions against Myanmar is still in place, the JADE Act of 2008. 
A good chunk of the Fortune 500 is poised for new explorations in oil, gas, timber, tourism, gems, banking, infrastructure. After decades of repression and isolation under a paranoid military regime, Myanmar needs everything. Companies from Shell to Suzuki have been nosing around for leases, concessions, office space and factories. Even the state oil company from Belarus - itself no darling of the West - has reportedly been hatching a deal. 
Britain, in the person of Prime Minister David Cameron, was careful enough to suspend its sanctions rather than lift them altogether, and the European Union was due to meet Monday to discuss similar suspensions.
Carrot and stick. Trust but verify. 
Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi, standing on her porch in Yangon with Mr. Cameron, supported the suspension tactic, saying it would "make it quite clear to those who are against reform that should they try to obstruct the way of the reformers, then sanctions could come back. So this would strengthen the hand of the reformers."
And this was working quite nicely - until Monday. The reformers were not going to win every fight they picked with the government, Burma analysts are quick to point out, but this was their first "official" confrontation. As a political set piece, so far anyway, it was not an encouraging start.

- Asian Correspondent (@AsCorrespondent) April 23, 2012
Anna Roberts, executive director of Burma Campaign UK, seemed to sense that reactionary elements inside the Myanmar government might yet spoil the party. Earlier this month she suggested that the E.U. establish specific benchmarks and timelines for sanctions to remain suspended. Reinstating the sanctions, she reasoned, would be difficult, given the E.U.'s often glacial decision-making process.
"We know from experience," Ms. Roberts said, "that the Burmese government is expert at delaying tactics. We also know the E.U. can tend to be slow and indecisive, looking for reasons to delay action."
"All the U.K. businesses that have dreamed of digging out Burmese jade or removing oil and gas, or teak and ebony, or setting up trainer-making sweatshops to undercut those of Cambodia, need dream no more," said Peter Popham, a biographer of Ms. Aung San Suu Kyi. 
"But then what?" he said. "If the sanctions are only 'suspended', when might they be re-imposed? Are there to be no benchmarks at all? What about the corruption, the child soldiers, the massive theft of land, the war still fomenting in the far north? The answer will be a Europe-wide shrug: we do lots of questionable things in lots of questionable places already. Burma can join our club."
Zaw Nay Aung, a Burmese exile and research fellow at the Centre for International Studies at Oxford, said that sanctions carry real political weight with the new government, which is "desperately trying to re-brand its image."
"The nominally civilian government has been desperate for legitimacy," he said in a commentary for the Democratic Voice of Burma. "They no longer want to be a pariah and blacklisted by the Western world."

HEADLINE: Valuing Family Work

BYLINE: NANCY FOLBRE


HIGHLIGHT: Insisting that parents who provide a great deal of care for family members also have an outside-the-home job to qualify for government assistance is a burden, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
The recent dust-up over a Democratic consultant's comment that Ann Romney, a stay-at-home mother, had never worked a day in her life initially seemed like a minor campaign skirmish. Everyone, including the woman who made the comment, quickly agreed that parenting was work. 
As the air cleared, however, the policy implications of defining unpaid activities as work - productive, socially valuable work - suddenly shimmered in the spotlight.
MSNBC's Chris Hayes quickly pointed out that Mrs. Romney's husband, Mitt, had, while serving as governor of Massachusetts, insisted on strict work requirements for single mothers applying for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. 
Ezra Klein of The Washington Post elaborated on this point, observing that government social programs ranging from Temporary Assistance for Needy Families to Social Security don't count parenting as work. Jon Stewart of "The Daily Show" poked fun at Mrs. Romney's enthusiasm for motherhood as a career choice. 
As someone put it on Yahoo.com, welfare mothers should try harder to find a husband worth a quarter of a billion dollars.

Some policy makers jumped into the opening. Representative Pete Stark, Democrat of California, introduced the Women's Option to Raise Kids Act, H.R. 4379, which would "recognize the critical job of raising children age 3 or younger as work." Under the legislation, low-income parents could receive Temporary Assistance for Needy Families even if not engaged in paid employment. 
Many Americans are famously hostile to welfare recipients and remain skeptical of the social value of unpaid work. But social scientists have developed reasonably accurate measures of the amount of time devoted to "unpaid" or "nonmarket" work (defined approximately as work that someone could, in principle, be paid to do). 
According to the American Time Use Survey, women who were not employed and living in a household with a child under the age of 6 spent an average of 6.1 hours a day, seven days a week, engaged in household tasks and care of household members in 2010. That adds up to a total work week of 42.7 hours, not counting other responsibilities like shopping, supervision of young children or care of adults living outside the household. 
Men in these households who were not employed did less, but their efforts still added up to 27.4 hours a week, a pretty significant part-time job. 
Employed women and men living with children under the age of 6 devoted about 36 percent less time to these basic categories of family work. They almost certainly devoted a substantial share of their earned income to purchasing substitutes for such services, including paid child care and meals away from home.
Living standards are determined by family work as well as family income. Gender inequality can take the form of differences in the total amount of work performed, as well as differences in take-home pay. 
Perpetrators of the so-called "mommy wars" emphasize conflicts between those who work only at home and those who also work for pay. What they fail to appreciate is the common challenge of combining paid and unpaid work effectively. 
Most mothers are struggling to meet their families' needs however best they can, and many fathers are doing the same. That's why I agree with family policy advocates who call for a range of public programs aimed to help parents do the best possible job.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
Today's Times

        
The Government Accountability Office is urging the Obama administration to cancel an $8 billion experimental program that pays bonuses to health insurance companies for millions of Medicare beneficiaries, Robert Pear writes. The G.A.O. says the test project is wasting money.

        
With many of his legislative efforts obstructed by Congressional Republicans, President Obama has increasingly sought to use executive powers to enact measures on issues ranging from fuel economy standards to domestic violence, Charlie Savage reports. Mr. Obama's increasingly assertive use of executive action could foreshadow pitched battles over the separation of powers in his second term, should he win re-election and Republicans consolidate their power in Congress.

        
As the Secret Service reels from a scandal over alleged misconduct during a trip to Cartagena, Colombia, the president and his aides are skittish about publicly lambasting the same agents who put themselves in harm's way on their behalf, Helene Cooper reports.

        
Some experts see improving odds for progress toward a tax and budget compromise, aided by the back-and-forth between President Obama and his likely rival Mitt Romney, John Harwood writes.

HEADLINE: This Week in Small Business: The Cookiegate Special

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: What's up? Building permits, gasoline prices, retail sales and hot sauce! 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
The Big Story: Not a Great Week for Housing
Housing starts, existing-home sales and mortgage applications to purchase a home all decline. As does builder confidence. But the American Institute of Architects remains positive and new building permits reach a three-and-a-half-year high. Bill McBride says the debate is about the strength of the recovery and not whether there is a recovery.
The Economy: There Is No Invisible Hand
American Express says business owners are optimistic but cautious. Gallup says economic confidence is up. A Chamber of Commerce study finds that while small-business confidence has been increasing since January, hiring has remained stagnant. Steve Forbes discusses economic cycles and job creation. Manufacturers may struggle to fill three million jobs by 2020. Bruce Bartlett wonders if small businesses really do create jobs. Bill Roth says that high gasoline prices are actually creating jobs and expanding the economy. Jonathan Schlefer says there is no invisible hand. Charles Biderman believes ignorance is bliss when it comes to financial data from the government: "My solution is very simple. Fire all the government economists and disband the B.L.S., B.E.A. and Census Bureau." This guy thinks there are 10 economic indicators that mislead small businesses. Inflation may pose problems for small businesses. And, for the third year in a row, there is no federal budget.
The Data: Hot Sauce

Economists are predicting that gross domestic product will rise to 2.4 percent in the second quarter. Retail sales (pdf) jump in March, and most economists agree it was another strong month. Farhad Manjoo suggests ways for Best Buy (and other retailers) to survive. Reports show healthy railroad profits and container traffic. February's freight transportation services index rises, and business sales and inventories are up. The index of leading economic indicators climbs 0.3 percent. Hot sauce is the eighth fastest growing industry in America. Members of the Conveyor Equipment Manufacturers Association report an increase in orders. But March's industrial production was flat and manufacturing slowed in the New York and Philadelphia regions. And two girls released a terrible video.
Marketing: The Mother Casket
A bakery owner turns Mitt Romney's insult into the Cookiegate Special. Heidi Cohen summarizes the blogging advice of 15 search engine optimization experts. Customers chime in on Costco's $949 Mother Casket. Anna Farmery asks: Do you create a lasting smile with your content? A search engine specialist shares the secrets of a successful landing page. A study finds that less than 20 percent of small-business Web sites link to social media, and 93 percent are not mobile-compatible. A new AT&T report (pdf) says that restaurants and auto-repair services are most frequently searched on mobile devices. Shannon Cherry says that adding a questionnaire to your site will re-energize your profits. Yellow Pages sites are more accurate than Google for local searching. Here are five content lessons from Jackie Robinson and five ways to respond to a social media attack, including: "Take protesters' comments seriously and make commitments to investigate their concerns or provide more information." One of the seven traits of an ideal marketer, says Nemo Chu, is a pleasant personality.
Start-Up: Is This a Bubble?
A start-up that specializes in bringing free university classes to the Web raises $16 million. Neal Cabage wonders if we're in a start-up bubble. A sleepover camp and an author series are resources for starting a business. Erica Swallow shares a start-up's strategy for hiring "awesome" employees. This infographic shows where the start-up jobs are. Jeff Haden offers start-up advice you may not want but you absolutely need, such as, "Don't complain about your demanding business schedule": "That's just how it goes. Deal with it."
Around the Country: Lunch With Sean
The second annual Small Business Works seminars kick off May 21 in Pittsburgh. The Coachella music festival releases its 2013 all-hologram lineup. A bunch of other small-business competitions are happening this spring, including one where you can win lunch with Sean Parker. According to the Office Depot Small-Business Index, 70 percent of small businesses anticipate becoming more environmentally conscious over the next two years. Virginians find that bees are good for business. Chicago's mayor announces a 60 percent reduction in the number of required licenses. Small businesses in Sanford, Fla., are hoping for a return to normal. Deformities in Gulf Coast seafood alarm scientists. A TV channel for dogs is set to roll out. Potential post office closings are making small businesses nervous.
Around the World: Spain's Economy Goes to Pot
Here are the world's most resource-rich countries. A Spanish municipality turns to the growing of cannabis to bolster its finances. Britain's economy is taking advantage of the Internet. The International Monetary Fund is predicting modest growth as Europe starts to exit recession. A German company makes a new kind of solar panel. Italy struggles to foster a start-up culture.
Red Tape Update: No Chance
Small businesses are getting a lot of political attention these days, and a few representatives help Congress determine what's next on the entrepreneurship policy agenda. Scott Shane suggests the best investments government can make in small businesses. The Internal Revenue Service explains what to do if you get a notice. The Buffett Rule would hit only 1 percent of small-business owners, and the Senate torpedoes it. The House of Representatives passes a $46 billion small-business tax-cut bill that has little chance of clearing the Senate or surviving a presidential veto. Ever wonder which 25 companies pay the most in taxes? Or why it's hard to be Michael Jordan? The health care mandate's roots can be traced to George Washington. Here are 10 signs your accountant is dumb.
Finance: Mobile Banking Is Not Optional
Drew McLelland says that mobile banking is not optional "for financial institutions that want to be in business in 2020." Mark Marich reports that angels are feeling confident. Jose Pagliery reports that small companies are faring better - but not enough to justify taking on debt. Small businesses in Buffalo are borrowing less, and this report says small businesses are having a tough time getting loans all over. A Delaware bank says its job creation program has created more than 100 jobs since September 2011. Wells Fargo goes into the prison business.
Management: I Have a Dream
Nick Hughes explains how he made sleep a priority - and became more productive. Laura Smoliar explains how to dress for success when running your business. Here are some business tools that will give you more time with your family. A study from Nationwide Financial shows African-American small-business owners are worried about their employees' retirement plans. Here are six steps to crossing anything off your bucket list. Nick Scheidies points out the four biggest mistakes of the world's four biggest entrepreneurs. A study of hiring personnel finds social media Web sites are playing a significant role in the hiring process. A study reveals businesses can manage without the boss but not without the office administrator. Warren Rutherford suggests five reasons baby boomers will buy a franchise. Shabbir Dahod explains why entrepreneurs are unreasonable: "Unreasonable people see the world as it should be and not how it is today. We don't want incremental improvements but a whole new way of solving customer problems."
Technology: A Pocket Whiteboard
Michael Dell talks about Dell's present and future. Microsoft had a nice quarter. Nokia is on track to run out of cash next year. Jill Konrath says she learned three things about e-mail last week. Battery-powered autos are proving a tough sell. Here are some insanely expensive gadgets for the 1 percent. The space shuttle arrives in Washington. Greg Anderson says that tablets bring sales force automation back to the future, and Eric Berridge explains how the iPad is transforming the enterprise. The Noteboard is a $10 pocket whiteboard. Rick Broida lists five free programs every business owner should use. New York is the second-biggest city for technology start-ups. Philly Tech Week has a busy schedule this week.
The Week's Bests
Advice for Expanding In China. Angela Yang suggests embracing cultural differences: "The Chinese work culture is more personal than in the U.S. ... Sometimes it takes longer to do business in China because of this getting-to-know-you phase. Yes, it can test the patience of non-Chinese but this is a key cultural difference worth remembering. Not understanding and respecting this cultural difference can be perceived as being insulting, overly aggressive, and result in lost business and relationships."
Reason to Choose Optimism. John Horgan says we've come a long way: "Yes, we still face enormous problems globally, and continued progress is by no means guaranteed. We may never entirely eradicate poverty, disease, tyranny and war, as J.F.K. hoped. But given how far we've come toward creating a healthier, wealthier, freer and more peaceful world, surely we can go much further, especially if we reject pessimism and work to solve our problems. Journalist and peace activist Norman Cousins liked to say, 'We don't know enough to be pessimists.' I'd go further than Cousins: We know enough to be optimists."

HEADLINE: N.Y.U. to Create Research Institute in Brooklyn

BYLINE: PATRICK MCGEEHAN


HIGHLIGHT: New York University has struck a deal with city officials that clears the way for it to create an applied-science research institute in Downtown Brooklyn. 

 BODY:
 It took 14 speakers and an 11-page news release on Monday to spread the news that city officials had struck a deal for New York University to create a school of applied science in Downtown Brooklyn.
 The agreement, which has been in the works for months, would end years of debate about what to do with the old headquarters of the city's transit authority at 370 Jay Street. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority had largely abandoned the 61-year-old building, transferring many of its occupants to other offices in Manhattan. 
 To move the transit authority's equipment and remaining employees out, N.Y.U. promised to pay $50 million of the relocation costs. It also agreed to pay as much as $10 million to move the New York Police Department out of some space it occupies in the building.
 In exchange, the city agreed to rent the building for $1 a year to N.Y.U., a private university with an endowment of $2.5 billion. The city also offered a $15 million package of breaks on taxes and energy costs and possibly some cash.
 Asked why public property would essentially be turned over to a private university that charges more than $40,000 a year for tuition, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said that the public would benefit from having the school built in the hub of Brooklyn.
 N.Y.U. "is putting their cash on the line," the mayor said. "We should be saying thank you to them."
 And many elected officials and business leaders lined up behind the mayor to do just that. As he spoke at a lectern in the lobby of the Polytechnic Institute of New York University's building across from 370 Jay Street, he was flanked by nearly three dozen people who were given credit for having helped in some way.
 Several of them were leaders of universities that formed a consortium to bid in the competition that the city's Economic Development Corporation set up to establish a graduate school of applied science. Mr. Bloomberg saw that project as a solution to the city's inability to compete with Silicon Valley for engineering and science talent.
 Cornell University, in partnership with the Technion school in Israel, won the competition with a plan to build a $2 billion campus on Roosevelt Island. But the group led by N.Y.U. forged ahead with its plan to create a smaller school in Brooklyn. The other schools involved are NYU-Poly, the City University of New York, Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Warwick, the University of Toronto and the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay. 
 N.Y.U. officials did not say how much they expected to spend on the venture. But John Beckman, a spokesman for N.Y.U., said the consortium would spend as much as $750 per square foot to gut and renovate the building - if it determined that the project was feasible. The group plans to create the center even if it decides that the transit agency's building is not suitable, he said.
 On Monday, a notice taped to the wall of the building's lobby warned entrants that work was under way to remove asbestos. Outside, the building's lower facade was obscured from view by scaffolding that has been in place for years.
 Marty Markowitz, the always-on borough president of Brooklyn, proclaimed that "370 Jay Street will no longer be an eyesore to Downtown Brooklyn."
 But officials of the Transport Workers Union were not so thrilled when they heard about the deal. "It's a win-win for everyone but transit riders, who are still feeling the horrendous effects of the massive service cuts the M.T.A. engaged in in 2010," said John Samuelsen, president of Local 100, which represents 40,000 transit workers.
 Mr. Samuelsen said the transit authority should have renovated the Jay Street building instead of moving into more expensive quarters in Lower Manhattan and reducing service. But transit officials, who approved the transaction with N.Y.U. at a meeting on Monday, said it would have cost more than $200 million to modernize the building in Brooklyn.
City officials provided lofty estimates of the benefits the city would reap from the school, which is expected to start up next year in rented space nearby and move into the building in 2017. Mr. Bloomberg said the project would yield more than 2,000 construction jobs and that over 30 years, it would generate more than $5.5 billion in economic activity and $597 million in tax revenue. 
 If all that comes true, the time and effort expended to wrangle the deal to fruition will have been worthwhile, said Daniel L. Squadron, a Democratic state senator. 
"With the number of people up here and the amount of time this took, we could have built a new building," Mr. Squadron said, gesturing toward the assemblage standing two and three deep behind him. "Rarely has one building been so hard to make work."

HEADLINE: Fact Check: Income Losses Under Obama

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney says median income has fallen $3,000 since President Obama took office. Is he right? 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney has been citing an interesting economic statistic lately about the economy under Barack Obama: "Well, let's look at what happened. What you're not going to hear is that during his term median income in America has dropped by $3,000." Here he is on "Hannity," repeating the same number.
That's a pretty striking figure. Is it true? The answer depends somewhat on what numbers you use - there are more and less charitable options available - but the answer is arguably yes.
The Labor Department's official data on annual household income come from a giant survey called the American Community Survey. The most recent figures available from that survey go through only 2010, unfortunately.
Some economists have tried to estimate this number from a much smaller survey that is conducted each month as part of the jobs report. These numbers are noisy but can still be useful.
Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, sent us his own quarterly calculations based on this source:
President Obama took office in the first quarter of 2009, when median household income was $54,797.63. As of the last quarter of 2011, median household income was $52,377.21.
This was the interval Mr. Zandi suggested using to check Mr. Romney's statement, and it shows an income drop of $2,420.42. That's not $3,000, of course, but it's still pretty bad.
One could also reasonably argue that it might be more appropriate to use the quarter Mr. Obama took office as the baseline, rather than the quarter in which he was sworn in. In the fourth quarter of 2008, median household income was about $55,380.17.
Starting from that quarter gives us a decline of $3,002.96, almost exactly the number Mr. Romney cited.
Some important caveats: As I (and others) have said before, presidents probably get much too much credit when the economy is doing well and much too much blame when the economy is doing poorly.
Mr. Obama in particular inherited an economy that was really just starting the death spiral set off by the financial crisis, as you can see in the chart above. And as Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff have shown, economies struck by major financial crises generally take 10 years to fully recover.
We're currently in Year 5 after the crisis first hit. Since median household income hit bottom in the first quarter of 2010, it has risen about $769.36, not nearly enough to cover the ground lost on the way down.

HEADLINE: Executive Overreach

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: George W. Bush tried to bypass Congress with executive orders. Now Barack Obama is doing the same thing. 

 BODY:
President George W. Bush used his executive power to bypass Congress, almost as a matter of routine. Now President Barack Obama is pulling the same stunt.
I was appalled, and so was the Times editorial board (and so, in fact was Senator Barack Obama) when a Boston Globe reporter, Charlie Savage, documented Mr. Bush's use of presidential signing statements and executive orders. But I am not appalled by the way Mr. Obama is relying on those very instruments - as detailed in today's Times by that same enterprising reporter, who now works for us. Context and intent make all the difference.

Vice President Dick Cheney, as we wrote in a 2008 editorial, took "the bizarre view that the lesson of Watergate was that Congress was too powerful and the president not powerful enough." After the attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, the Bush/Cheney team saw an opening to free the presidency from checks and balances. They exploited the fear and insecurity that were pervasive at the time to claim emergency powers, creating offshore detention centers where prisoners were held without charge and eavesdropping on Americans without a warrant.
Mr. Bush's signing statements not only amounted to a significant usurpation of power, but they came at a time when Congress was giving him everything he wanted. Congress passed the deeply flawed Patriot Act and authorized the invasion of Iraq. It even gave its retroactive approval to warrantless wiretapping. Mr. Bush also achieved many of his domestic policy goals, including tax breaks that mostly benefited the richest Americans.
The contrast with the Obama administration is stark.
For nearly three years, President Obama devoted a great deal of effort to finding compromises with Congressional Republicans. That was futile, in my view, since those Republicans had made it clear from the day he was inaugurated in 2009 that their plan was to oppose everything he wanted, and then paint him as a failed president. (Mitch McConnell, the Senate Minority Leader, said his party's "number one goal" was to keep the president from winning a second term.)
Mr. Obama got fed up, finally, last fall, according to Mr. Savage's article, and the result was the "We Can't Wait" project, which has led to dozens of executive actions on a range of issues, including jobs for veterans and fuel economy standards.
Unlike the Bush/Cheney team, Mr. Obama did not take office with the explicit goal of creating new powers for the presidency. That was not part of his agenda. Moreover, his executive actions often are more modest in their effect than the White House's public relations team might admit.
Government by executive order is not sustainable in the long-term. Nor is it desirable, whether you agree or disagree with those orders. But in this particular case, there may be no alternative.

HEADLINE: A Dastardly Plot to Avoid Taxes

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Eric Cantor says too many Americans don't pay income taxes. 

 BODY:
Contrary to the conventional wisdom, Republicans are not against all tax increases. Rep. Eric Cantor, the House Majority Leader, thinks poor people might need a tax hike.
At a Politico-sponsored breakfast last week, Mr. Cantor said: "We also know that over 45 percent of the people in this country don't pay income taxes at all, and we have to question whether that's fair. And should we broaden the base in a way that we can lower rates for everybody that pays taxes."

That statement is true, although it's misleading. According to the Urban Institute-Brookings Tax Policy Center, 46 percent of households owed no federal income tax for 2011, which doesn't mean they paid no taxes at all. Mr. Cantor chose not to mention payroll taxes and excise taxes on gas and other items.
Setting that detail aside, Mr. Cantor's untaxed group includes college students and senior citizens with no income, and is mostly comprised of households with incomes less than $17,000 a year. If there are three or more people in that household, it falls below the official poverty line.
Republicans have become obsessed with the idea that we must broaden the base. They like to say that poor people "don't have any skin in the game" when it comes to economic policy - although I bet that if you asked a single mother with two kids earning $16,000 a year, she'd tell you she feels pretty well skinned by the game.
At the Politico event, Mr. Cantor was asked if broadening the base means tax increases for the poor. "I'm saying that, just in a macro way of looking at it, you've got to discuss that issue," he said. "I've never believed that you go raise taxes on those that have been successful, that are paying in, taking away from them, so that you just hand out and give to someone else."
There are many things wrong with this nonsense, but I'll just point out one: Mr. Cantor and other Republicans who push this line have it exactly backwards. The problem is not that so many Americans don't pay taxes. It's that so many Americans are too poor to pay taxes.

HEADLINE: The Cookstove Conundrum

BYLINE: VIVEK DEHEJIA


HIGHLIGHT: Giving away high-tech cookstoves is no panacea for curbing indoor air pollution. 

 BODY:
Cooking the family meal can be a dangerous business for poor people in developing countries. According to a study by the World Health Organization, indoor air pollution from "primitive household cooking fires" is the leading environmental cause of death in the world. In most rural homes, which lack electricity, a stove can be an open fire and the fuel as basic as wood, dried animal dung or agricultural residue, together known as "biomass" fuels. The result is nearly 2 million deaths a year, worldwide, almost as many as are caused by malaria and tuberculosis combined. What's worse, cooking with biomass releases carbon dioxide and "black carbon" into the atmosphere and consequently is a significant contributor to climate change.
Could technology be the savior?
That seems to be the official view of the world's development establishment. In September 2010, U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton announced the creation of the Global Alliance for Clean Cookstoves. This is a public-private partnership led by the United Nations Foundation, with support from the governments of many developed countries, including the United States, and multinational enterprises such as the investment bank Morgan Stanley and the oil producer Shell. And their ambitious goal, "100 by 20," is to get 100 million homes to adopt clean stoves by the year 2020. They've even secured the actress Julia Roberts as a global ambassador.
The Global Alliance isn't modest about its goal, nor is it about the claims it makes on behalf of clean stoves. According to its web site, a clean stove reduces child pneumonia by 50 percent; saves the equivalent of one to two tons of carbon dioxide per year; and leads to savings in fuel costs that allows a stove to pay for itself. However, until recently, evidence to support these claims has been scant, and based on laboratory tests or highly controlled conditions in which stoves were frequently monitored and maintained by the researchers. That leaves open how robust the conclusions are.
Finally, the findings of an important new study, which tested the efficacy of clean stoves in real world, rather than laboratory conditions, have been released and the news isn't good for the advocates.
In a working paper released this month, Rema Hanna, a professor of public policy at Harvard's Kennedy School, and Esther Duflo and Michael Greenstone, economics professors at M.I.T., report the results of a randomized controlled trial on the adoption of clean stoves in India. Ms. Duflo, together with Abhijit Banerjee, also an economics professor at M.I.T., has championed the use of randomized experiments, like those used in testing new drugs, to measure the effectiveness of interventions like these.
Ms. Hanna and her colleagues worked with Gram Vikas, an award-winning nongovernmental organization, to provide 2,600 "improved" stoves to rural households in the eastern state of Orissa. Based on a public lottery, a third of the homes received a new stove at the beginning of the project, the second third got one about two years later and the final third were equipped at the end of the study period. Households were followed for four years after the initial adoption.
The study found that acceptance and, crucially, usage, of a new stove wasn't universal even initially, and usage declined rapidly over time, as stoves broke down and households failed to make the necessary repairs or investment in maintenance.
Some households who'd voluntarily entered the lottery refused the new stove, even though it was heavily subsidized. Other households that accepted the improved stove continued to use their old stove alongside the new one - even when it was working well - before giving up on the new one altogether when it broke down.
Not surprisingly, the presumed health benefits didn't show up either. While the study showed some health improvements for the primary cook in the household during the first year after installation, the effect vanished over time as proper use and maintenance of the new stove declined.
The researchers found, in the aggregate, no statistically valid evidence that the stoves had any measurable impact over a wide range of health outcomes, including lung function, infant birth weight, infant mortality, or even the chance of getting sick.
Lastly, and most disturbingly, the researchers found that those who adopted the new stoves actually saw a in their living standards compared with their neighbors who hadn't. They spent more time maintaining their new stoves (even though, as we saw, this wasn't enough to keep the stoves usable in many cases), which took them away from income-earning opportunities, and there was no significant reduction in fuel costs or time spent cooking.
Ms. Hanna gave me, via email, her interpretation of the results:
This is a laudably measured conclusion in light of the damning findings of the study. But some in the news media haven't been as circumspect and have gone instead for the jugular.
A sharply worded news article in The Washington Post was stinging enough to provoke a response from the Global Alliance. An opinion piece in the Boston Globe by Edward Glaeser, an economics professor at Harvard, was scarcely more muted, concluding bluntly: "Dumping stoves into the developing world isn't going to alter the long-standing advantages of traditional methods."
Mr. Glaeser is right. Evangelists for technological solutions, in their proselytizing zeal, often forget that these need to be implemented by human beings, not robots. To be effective, technology must be linked to economic or other behavioral incentives. Now, there's a thought that should be allowed to simmer on the stove.

HEADLINE: A Would-Be Shoe Bomber Testifies in a Terror Trial

BYLINE: By MOSI SECRET

 BODY:
He was supposed to be the other shoe bomber. Saajid Badat said Osama bin Laden himself had dispatched him to board a plane with a bomb sewn in his shoe, which he would detonate in midair as part of a choreographed attack that would crash the American economy.
But unlike Richard C. Reid, a member of Al Qaeda whose unsuccessful attempt in 2001 to detonate explosives in his shoes on a Paris-to-Miami flight changed airport security, Mr. Badat did not follow through with the attack. 
On Monday, over 10 years after he backed out, hiding the equipment under his bed in Britain, Mr. Badat testified by video to his role in the shoe-bombing conspiracy in Federal District Court in Brooklyn in the terrorism trial of Adis Medunjanin, a Queens man who is accused of joining his high school classmates in a separate plot to blow up New York subways.
Another admitted terrorist, Bryant Neal Vinas, a Long Island man who fought with Al Qaeda against American troops in Afghanistan, also appeared in court as a government witness on Monday. He had pleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing.
The testimony of the two men was a brief departure from the facts of the subway bombing plot, which federal authorities have called one of the most dangerous threats to America since the Sept. 11 attacks.
Instead, Mr. Badat and Mr. Vinas were called to corroborate facts about the training in Qaeda-run camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
Mr. Medunjanin is accused of traveling to one such camp in 2008 along with Zarein Ahmedzay and Najibullah Zazi, who testified last week that the three of them had learned how to make bombs there and had received orders from senior Qaeda leaders, who urged them to return to the United States to stage a terrorist attack. Mr. Ahmedzay and Mr. Zazi have pleaded guilty.
The testimony of Mr. Badat, who served more than a decade in prison after pleading guilty to terrorism charges in Britain, appeared in a video made there.
Mr. Badat said he traveled to Afghanistan in 1999 and came into contact with many of the members of Al Qaeda whom Mr. Ahmedzay and Mr. Zazi recalled meeting in Pakistan nine years later.
Among those he encountered was Bin Laden.
''It was just the two of us in a room, and he explained to me his justification for the mission,'' Mr. Badat said of the shoe bomb.
''He said that the American economy is like a chain. If you break one link of the chain, the whole economy will be brought down,'' Mr. Badat testified. ''This operation will ruin the aviation industry and in turn the whole economy will come down.''
Mr. Badat said Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, the mastermind of the Sept. 11 attacks, had personally wished Mr. Reid and Mr. Badat well on their mission.
Unlike Mr. Reid, Mr. Badat never boarded his flight. He testified that he had been fearful and worried that his family would get dragged into an investigation.
He contacted his Qaeda handlers about his decision but did not inform law enforcement, saying he remained committed to the ''jihadist ideology.'' He later learned through news reports that Mr. Reid had been stopped by fellow passengers while trying to light a fuse in his shoe.
Mr. Badat was arrested in November 2003. He initially received a sentence of 13 years, but that was cut to 11 years when he agreed to testify against other members of Al Qaeda.
He said he now believed the group's leadership manipulated the people who went to the training camps.
Though Mr. Badat completed his prison term in Britain, terrorism charges are still pending against him in the United States, which was why he refused to come to the country to testify in person. Mr. Reid is serving a life sentence.

HEADLINE: New Fashion Wrinkle: Stylishly Hiding the Gun

BYLINE: By MATT RICHTEL

 BODY:
Woolrich, a 182-year-old clothing company, describes its new chino pants as an elegant and sturdy fashion statement, with a clean profile and fabric that provides comfort and flexibility.
And they are great for hiding a handgun.
The company has added a second pocket behind the traditional front pocket for a weapon. Or, for those who prefer to pack their gun in a holster, it can be tucked inside the stretchable waistband. The back pockets are also designed to help hide accessories, like a knife and a flashlight. 
The chinos, which cost $65, are not for commandos, but rather, the company says, for the fashion-aware gun owner. And Woolrich has competition. Several clothing companies are following suit, building businesses around the sharp rise in people with permits to carry concealed weapons.
Their ranks swelled to around seven million last year from five million in 2008, partly because of changes to state laws on concealed handguns.
Shawn Thompson, 35, who works at an auto dealership in eastern Kentucky, bought two shirts last month from the Woolrich Elite Concealed Carry line. Both, he wrote on his blog, are a step up from more rugged gear.
''Most of the clothes I used in the past to hide my sidearm looked pretty sloppy and had my girlfriend complaining about my looks,'' he wrote, adding in an interview, ''I'm not James Bond or nothing, but these look pretty nice.''
The shirt has a barely discernible side slit with Velcro through which, he said, he can yank his Colt 1911 from his waistband holster. Depending on circumstances and mood, he might also carry a folding knife and, at night, a flashlight in a pair of Woolrich chinos his girlfriend bought for him.
Carriers of concealed guns say the new options are a departure from the law enforcement and military look, known as ''tactical,'' long favored by gun owners.
The latest styles, by contrast, are called ''concealed carry'' or ''covert fashion.''
''What we've tried to do is create a collection of garments that allows the end user to have stylish lifestyle apparel but have features in the garment that enable them to carry a weapon and draw the weapon quickly,'' said David Hagler, a vice president at 5.11 Tactical, who was lured from Nike to work at 5.11, one of the biggest makers of clothing for soldiers and police officers.
The company's growing concealed-carry line includes a lightweight water-resistant vest coming this fall -- the sort of vest that is standard and trendy at any mainstream outdoor shop but has strategic pockets for guns. It also includes a stealth compartment in front so the wearer can appear to be warming his hands while actually gripping a pistol in a waistband holster.
Other companies are rushing to meet the demand for concealed-carry clothing. Under Armour, best known for its sports and action gear, will be adding a jacket and a plaid shirt with Velcro pockets for easy gun access.
Kevin Eskridge, senior director for outdoor product and design at the company, said the company had seen demand double in the last year for such clothing from traditional outdoor and sporting goods stores, like Dick's Sporting Goods and Cabela's.
Mr. Eskridge said the Under Armour apparel was catching on because of fashion but also because of its features, including moisture-wicking fabric.
''Others are making shirts with gun access but using regular cotton,'' he said. With his company's fabrics, ''there's no stink factor,'' he said. And if gun owners do not use fabrics that wick away moisture, ''You'll literally rust out,'' he added.
Gun experts suggest that there are many reasons for the growth in the number of people with concealed-carry permits. They say it is partly due to a changing political and economic climate -- gun owners are professing to want a feeling of control -- and state laws certainly have made a difference.
After a campaign by gun rights advocates, 37 states now have ''shall issue'' statutes that require them to provide concealed-carry permits if an applicant meets legal requirements, like not being a felon. (A handful of other states allow the concealed carrying of handguns without a permit). By contrast, in 1984 only 8 states had such statutes, and 15 did not allow handgun carrying at all, said John Lott, a researcher of gun culture who has held teaching or research posts at a number of universities, including the University of Chicago.
Only one state, Illinois, now forbids handgun carrying in any form, but the legislature is considering a change.
A majority of states have long allowed the open carrying of handguns, said Mr. Lott, who also provided the data on gun permits. But the reality, said Mr. Lott and other gun experts, is that people do not want to show others that they are carrying a weapon or invite sharp questioning from the police.
The clothing lines address a perceived need in the concealed-carry subculture. Gun owners say they want to practice ''maximum uncertainty,'' meaning that if a gun is sufficiently concealed, a potential criminal will be unsure whether to attack. Gun experts say the research is inconclusive about whether such tactics reduce crime. Regardless, the clothing makers are jumping on the line of thinking.
''When someone walks down the street in a button-down and khakis, the bad guy gets a glimmer of fear, wondering: are they packing or not?'' said Allen Forkner, a spokesman for Woolrich, which started its concealed-carry line in 2010 with three shirts.
The company has since added new patterns for shirts, pants and the Elite Discreet Carry Twill jacket, in dark shale gray and dark wheat tan. In addition to its gun-friendly pockets, the jacket has a channel cut through the back that the company says can be used to store plastic handcuffs.
Not everyone who carries a concealed gun is a fan of the new fashion. Howard Walter, 61, a salesman at Wade's Eastside Guns in Bellevue, Wash., said he preferred to carry his Colt -- and a couple of knives and two extra magazines -- in a durable pair of work pants.
''They don't shout 'gun,' they shout 'average guy in the street,' '' said Mr. Walter, who years ago worked in sales at Nordstrom. But really, he said, the most important thing in picking clothing is to choose something that works for the weapon. ''They should dress for the gun,'' he said he advised his customers. ''Not for the fashion.''

HEADLINE: Mexican Immigration Is Off Sharply, Ending 40-Year Trend, Study Confirms

BYLINE: By JULIA PRESTON

 BODY:
Mexican immigration to the United States, the largest wave of migrants from a single country in the nation's history, has stopped increasing after four decades of surging growth and may be declining, according to a report released Monday by the Pew Hispanic Center.
In what the report called a ''notable reversal of the historic pattern,'' the number of Mexicans leaving rose sharply in the five years after 2005, while the new flow of migrants coming from Mexico into the United States fell steeply, Pew demographers found. 
For the first time in at least two decades, the population of illegal immigrants from Mexico living in this country significantly decreased, according to the report. In 2011, about 6.1 million Mexicans were living here illegally, down from a peak of nearly 7 million in 2007, it said.
''We really haven't seen anything like this in the last 30 or 40 years,'' said Jeffrey Passel, the senior demographer at the Pew Hispanic Center and a co-writer of the report with D'Vera Cohn and Ana Gonzalez-Barrera. The center, a nonpartisan research organization in Washington that does not advocate policy positions, has provided some of the most reliable estimates for the elusive numbers of Mexican immigrants.
Over all, the report said, about 58 percent of an estimated 11.2 million illegal immigrants in the United States are from Mexico.
The report provides material for all sides in the fierce debate over immigration policy. A major episode in that debate will take place on Wednesday when the Supreme Court hears arguments over a law passed by Arizona in 2010 to expand the powers of the local and state police to conduct immigration enforcement.
Arizona officials say that tough local enforcement measures like SB 1070, the statute they passed, are the most effective way to curb illegal immigration because they pressure migrants who lack legal status to return home. Immigrant advocates say those measures serve to separate families and drive illegal immigrants into the shadows, and they point to prolonged high unemployment in this country as the primary reason for reduced immigration.
Mr. Passel said the data does not allow Pew demographers to say which factor was most important in reducing the population of illegal immigrants. The report cited a mix, including high unemployment in the United States, particularly in the construction industry; heightened border enforcement and increased deportations by the American authorities; and a long-term decline in birth rates in Mexico.
The migration from Mexico that began after 1970 brought, by far, the largest numbers of immigrants from one country in American history, the report said, with about 30 percent of 39.6 million immigrants today having been born in Mexico. The 12 million Mexican-born people who live in the United States -- about one in every 10 Mexicans in the world -- comprise more than all the immigrants in any other country, the Pew report said.
The report presents a striking change from earlier findings by the Pew Hispanic Center on the number of Mexicans who have been returning to their country. While earlier Pew studies said the data did not show any exodus, the report published Monday includes new data from the 2010 Mexican census revealing that about twice as many Mexicans returned home from 2005 to 2010 than in the previous five years. In all, about 1.4 million people moved from the United States to Mexico in that time, the Mexican census showed.
The report cited Mexican data showing a big increase in the number of United States citizen children with Mexican parents who were living in Mexico -- to about 500,000 in 2010 from about 240,000 in 2000. Some of those Americans are the children of deportees, the data suggested.
The report found that more Mexicans who were deported after coming to the United States to work said they were not likely to try to re-enter. About 20 percent of deportees in 2010 said they would not try to return, up from 7 percent in 2005. Still, in 2010, six in every 10 deportees said they would try to re-enter within seven days, according to the new Pew report.
The report did little to quell a controversy among demographers over the scope and causes of return migration to Mexico.
Steven A. Camarota, the director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington, a group that advocates reduced immigration, noted that he had first reported an outflow of Mexicans in 2009. ''The evidence is very strong,'' Mr. Camarota said, ''that there is a slowdown of people coming from Mexico and a big increase in people leaving.''
Wayne A. Cornelius, a director of the Center of Expertise on Migration and Health at the University of California, said that in his most recent field research, which drew on interviews with migrants in Mexico and California, there were no signs of increased return migration. The ''overwhelming pattern,'' he said, ''is that migrants who have made it to the United States and found employment, particularly if it is relatively stable despite the recession, are hanging in there and riding it out.''

HEADLINE: A Patient for Now, but Maybe a Mother Someday

BYLINE: By SULEIKA JAOUAD. 
Suleika Jaouad is a 23-year-old writer from Saratoga Springs, N.Y. Her column, ''Life, Interrupted,'' chronicling her experiences as a young adult with cancer, appears weekly on Well.

 BODY:
The family minivan idles at the intersection of 59th and York in Midtown Manhattan. My boyfriend swabs my midriff with alcohol as he steadies the needle. My parents look on from the front seat, quietly studying their 22-year-old daughter and the young man they've known for only a month. The needle is filled with gonadotropin, a hormone that stimulates the ovaries to produce eggs. I'm late for my checkup at the fertility clinic.
How in the world did I get here? 
Last spring, I found out I had leukemia. Before the horror of the news even had time to sink in, I had to absorb a second shock: The chemotherapy treatments that could save my life would also make me infertile.
Leukemia is an emergency, and oncologists are the first responders: They are trained to beat cancer; everything else must take a back seat. It was only after I asked about fertility that the doctors told me about the available options.
This is one of the challenges of being a young woman with cancer. In many ways, I am still a child myself, relying on my parents to take care of me. But I have an adult disease. Most patients with my type of cancer, a form of acute myeloid leukemia, are long past their childbearing years. While my oncologists are intent on saving my life -- and I am forever indebted to them for this -- preserving my chance to be a mother some day just didn't seem to be on their radar.
A few days after my diagnosis, I was sitting at the table at home in upstate New York. My father was cooking fresh squid on the grill, his childhood favorite. I should have been savoring my last days before a long hospitalization, but I was agitated from the fertility drugs. I looked across the table at my boyfriend. We had met only eight months earlier, and here we were, considering the benefits of freezing embryos with his sperm (the option with the greater chance of success) versus freezing only my eggs. It was awkward territory.
A social worker cautioned me about embryos, citing the unforeseeable legal and emotional obstacles that could arise down the road. My boyfriend was open to creating embryos, but told me the choice was ultimately mine. But how could I plan to have a child with him when I didn't even know if I was going to survive myself? I put off the decision as long as possible, but now a nurse was waiting for my answer, and I had to decide in minutes. With some reluctance, I told them to freeze only my eggs.
At the fertility clinic, the walls are bare except for a sign that says ''No Children Allowed.'' Several women, some with husbands or boyfriends, are sitting in plush chairs, waiting for the lady in the lab coat to call the next name. I guess that most of them are paying full price to be here. Fertility treatment can cost $25,000, and is rarely covered by insurance. In my case, I was lucky to get a scholarship from Fertile Hope, a program from the Livestrong Foundation that provides support and information on fertility options to cancer patients and survivors.
In most doctors' offices, it's hard to know why the stranger next to you is there, but everyone is in this waiting room for the same reason. No one is talking, but everybody seems to be sizing one another up. Most of the women here look to be in their mid-30s, and a few might be approaching 40. Based on how they are dressed, I would guess that they have jobs to return to after their appointments. I am wearing my college sweatshirt emblazoned with ''Class of 2010,'' and I am feeling out of place. My boyfriend and I are both unemployed and in our 20s, with only one thing to do today. And now we are looking at our shoes.
The timing in all of this, like everything else these days, is out of sequence. But this is my new reality as a young adult with cancer. These women may not have cancer, but I am linked to them. My breasts, like theirs, have swelled from the hormone injections. Our bodies are sending us signals to get ready for pregnancy even though none of us can be certain it will happen. And although I'm not planning for a baby anytime soon, preserving my ability to have children feels like my only lifeline to an uncertain future. All of us are together and alone in this room. Hoping for life.

HEADLINE: European Debt Concerns Prompt a Major Sell-Off

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks fell on Monday as political turmoil in Europe cast doubts on the euro zone's ability to push through measures to end its debt crisis and as Wal-Mart Stores sank after a report it had not taken adequate measures after a bribery investigation. 
The Dutch prime minister tendered his government's resignation on Monday after officials failed to agree on budget cuts. Adding to the uncertainty in Europe was an election in France on Sunday that threw the presidential race wide open.
The renewed worries came as the euro zone's business slump deepened at a faster rate than had been expected in April. The euro zone consists of the 17 members of the European Union that use the euro.
Europe's debt crisis has been a major headwind for equities in the United States as investors have worried it could hurt corporate profits. Bank shares suffered as a result, including Morgan Stanley, which fell 2.9 percent to $16.98.
''It's becoming clear the euro zone is in a recession, and that brings a lot of concern. To really get out of the debt problem, you need growth, and we haven't gotten to that step yet,'' said Henry B. Smith, chief investment officer at the Haverford Trust Company in Philadelphia.
Wal-Mart Stores slumped 4.7 percent to $59.54 and was the biggest drag on the Dow after The New York Times reported that Wal-Mart officials paid little heed to an internal investigation into bribery at its Mexican unit, Walmart de Mexico. Those shares dropped 12 percent to 37.89 pesos ($2.88).
The sell-off was broad with almost three stocks on the New York Stock Exchange falling for each one that rose. The Dow Jones industrial average was down 102.09 points, or 0.78 percent, at 12,927.17. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was down 11.59 points, or 0.84 percent, at 1,366.94. The Nasdaq composite index was down 30 points, or 1 percent, at 2,970.45. The economically sensitive S.& P. materials sector was among the worst performing, down 1.4 percent.
In after-hours trading, shares of Netflix tumbled 16 percent to $85.35 as it posted a first-quarter loss. Shares of Texas Instruments, however, were up 3.7 percent at $33.07 in after-hours trading after its results were released. The chip maker also forecast second-quarter revenue ahead of Wall Street estimates, signaling the end of a prolonged inventory-related decline in demand.
Despite Monday's sell-off, the S.& P. 500 is still up 8.7 percent for the year.
Materials shares mimicked a fall in commodity prices as copper prices dropped 1.6 percent. Shares in Freeport McMoran Copper and Gold fell 1.1 percent to $37.16.
Shares of Apple, which reports results Tuesday after the bell, briefly fell below their 50-day moving average for the first time in four months. Shares closed down 0.2 percent at $571.70.
Interest rates were slightly lower.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 8/32, to 100 17/32, and the yield fell to 1.94 percent from 1.96 percent late Friday.

HEADLINE: Manufacturing Bouncing Back For Chinese

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- A closely watched survey of manufacturing activity in China rebounded in April, offering the latest sign that the Chinese economy was gradually regaining some of the momentum it lost last year. 
The monthly survey, which is compiled by Markit and sponsored by HSBC, found that although conditions at factories remained difficult, government efforts to reinvigorate economic growth during the last few months had filtered through to companies.
The reading for April for the survey, the purchasing managers' index, was released on Monday and was 49.1. April was the sixth consecutive month of readings below 50, which separates expansion from contraction. In March, the reading was 48.3.
The improvement underscored the view held by many analysts that the Chinese economy is on course for a gradual slowdown, rather than a sharp collapse, this year -- if, as is widely expected, the authorities take more steps to bolster growth in coming months.
The once torrid pace of growth in China slowed last year as demand weakened because of the debt problems in the euro zone, sluggish growth in the United States economy and tightening measures by Beijing aimed at combating inflation.
Beijing has eased off the brakes in recent months, however, permitting banks once again to extend more loans to businesses. Policy makers now have room to deliver more support to the economy.
The rise in the April index ''suggests that the earlier easing measures have started to work and hence should ease concerns of a sharp growth slowdown,'' Qu Hongbin, China economist at HSBC, said in a note accompanying the release Monday.
''That said, the pace of both output and demand growth remains at a low level in an historical context, and the job market is under pressure,'' he said.
This, he added, meant that the authorities were likely to speed up monetary and fiscal easing in the second quarter of 2012.

HEADLINE: A Europe Tired of Cutbacks Has Few Alternatives

BYLINE: By JACK EWING and LIZ ALDERMAN; Liz Alderman reported from Paris and Peter Eavis contributed from New York.

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- Citizens from Prague to Paris to Amsterdam have made it abundantly clear the last few days that they are tired of the economic austerity forced on them by the euro zone debt crisis.
But as the budget-cutting pain of reduced government benefits and social services brings protesters to the streets and drives support for nationalist or far-left parties, it is not clear what the economic alternative might be. Rejecting austerity budgets in favor of more government spending will not automatically ensure economic growth, many economists say.
''The last thing these economies need is a debt-financed stimulus program,'' said Jorg Kramer, the chief economist of Commerzbank in Frankfurt.
Governments in countries like Spain are having enough trouble financing their existing debt, much less coming up with money for stimulus spending. Germany, the only large country in the euro zone with budgetary room to increase its deficit by spending more, is not willing to. (And neither was the Netherlands, at least until its government collapsed Monday over a dispute that essentially involves the austerity vs. growth debate.) 
Financial markets were down deeply and broadly in Europe Monday, on concerns over the backlash to austerity, and the sell-off carried over to the United States markets.
As more European countries teeter on the edge of recession or slip into one -- Spain, on Monday, was the latest to slide -- even the policy-making elite has begun to question whether Germany and the European Central Bank have gone too far in insisting that fiscal discipline is a prerequisite to growth.
Euro zone unity is under strain as other Europeans resent what they perceive as Germany's holier-than-thou attitude in insisting that all countries in the euro currency union keep their promises to reduce government budget deficits to 3 percent or less of gross domestic product. Germany's government deficit was a modest 1 percent of gross domestic product at the end of 2011.
''A global, undifferentiated rush to austerity will ultimately prove self-defeating,'' Christine Lagarde, the president of the International Monetary Fund, said at the fund's spring meeting in Washington on Saturday.
But Ms. Lagarde also acknowledged the quandary facing European leaders. Most of them simply do not have the resources to pay for public works projects or social programs that would ease the pain of rising unemployment and declining wages.
At the monetary fund meeting, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner continued his call for Europe to at least temporarily set aside budget cutting and engage in the sort of government spending stimulus that the Obama administration prescribed for the American economy in 2009.
(The United States, to the extent that it can continue getting away with its gaping budget deficit, relies on the world's seemingly insatiable appetite for the Treasury bonds that finance the American debt and deficit.)
The central, existential issue facing the euro zone is how to escape a vicious cycle. Budget cuts drag down growth and push up unemployment. Then, revenue falls as fewer people pay taxes -- forcing even more austerity. Economic growth seems absent from the equation.
On Monday there was fresh evidence of the poor state of the euro zone economy. Official data confirmed that Spain is in recession, after economic output fell 0.4 percent in the first three months of the year. Spain joins other European countries now in recession, including Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and, outside the euro zone, the Czech Republic. Even Germany may have fallen into recession in the first quarter, economists say, though official data is not out yet.
Meanwhile, a survey of European purchasing managers released by the research firm Markit on Monday showed an unexpected decline in confidence during April.
Signs of popular frustration are multiplying. In France, voters on Sunday gave the Socialist candidate, Francois Hollande, the most votes in the first round of presidential elections, after he promised to delay balancing the budget and instead hire more teachers and police officers and raise subsidies for industry.
President Nicolas Sarkozy's tight-budget policies in response to the euro zone crisis are one reason he is at risk of being voted out of office.
In Prague, an estimated 90,000 Czechs took to the streets on Saturday to demonstrate their lack of faith in a government that has cut the budget while raising taxes, and that also faces accusations of corruption.
Even the prudent Dutch face a political crisis as they try to agree on a government budget. The far-right Freedom Party of Geert Wilders walked out of budget talks rather than support more cuts needed to bring the deficit back in line with European Union rules.
These signs of unrest, though, do not seem to be mellowing Germany's insistence on strict austerity. Jens Weidmann, president of the Bundesbank, the German central bank, argued Monday that the core problem in the euro zone was a lack of faith in the soundness of governments' fiscal health.
The only solution, Mr. Weidmann said at the Economic Club of New York, is to put public finances in order.
''There is little alternative,'' said Mr. Weidmann, who is an influential voice on the governing council of the European Central Bank. ''In the end, you cannot borrow your way out of debt; cut your way out is the only promising approach.''
Mr. Weidmann's views are widely shared in Germany. But Germany is becoming isolated in Europe as an increasing number of economists and policy makers argue that euro zone countries could do more to offset the social effects of austerity on ordinary Europeans, which include a surge in suicides.
Marie Diron, an economist who advises the consulting firm Ernst & Young, said that Germany could slow down its own drive to balance the budget and do more to encourage domestic consumption. The rest of the European nations would benefit if Germany bought more of their exports.
''Austerity has to fit into a wider policy context,'' Ms. Diron said.
Last week, the International Monetary Fund called for Europe to begin issuing bonds backed by all members, so-called euro bonds, a measure that would take pressure off the most debt-burdened countries whose high borrowing costs are contributing to their economic woes.
In Germany, there is little support for such measures. ''It doesn't seem to be on the agenda at the moment,'' Ms. Diron said. ''Germany is enjoying the fact it is one of the few fiscally sound countries.''
There are also increasing calls for the European Central Bank to issue another round of inexpensive three-year loans to banks, as it has already done twice since December. The bank should also cut the benchmark interest rate from 1 percent, economists say, or resume purchases of euro zone government bonds to hold down borrowing costs.
But as it has in the past, the bank would probably take such steps only in return for an implicit guarantee from governments that they would do more to make their economies operate more efficiently.
Leaders like Mr. Sarkozy may gripe about the stubbornness of Germany and the European Central Bank. But economists also fault those leaders for doing too little to encourage investment and job creation within their borders -- for not doing the sorts of things that many experts say are the only way to achieve the long-term, sustainable economic growth that government spending can seldom achieve.
Most euro zone countries, including Germany, rank low on the World Bank's annual rankings on the ease of doing business. The survey grades countries according to such factors as how long it takes to set up a new business or enforce a contract in court.
Germany was only 19th in the most recent rankings, behind Malaysia and Thailand. Italy was a dismal 87th and Greece was in 100th place out of 183 countries.
In many cases, countries could improve their rankings by cutting red tape, which would also save money. But changes to make it easier to start a business, for example, often run afoul of vested interests that fear increased competition.
Even leaders in some of the afflicted countries say that fiscal stimulus through more government spending could backfire, by taking off the pressure on political leaders to make necessary changes.
Vitor Gaspar, the finance minister of Portugal, said in an interview that his country -- under a previous government -- made a mistake when it responded to a downturn in 2008 by pumping money into the economy. The result, he said, was a deeper debt problem without creation of any lasting growth.
''My country definitely provides a cautionary tale that shows that, in some instances, short-run expansionary policies can be counterproductive,'' Mr. Gaspar said.

HEADLINE: Even as It Hurts Economy, Bribery Is Taken in Stride

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD; Karla Zabludovsky contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- Every now and then, the health department shows up at Jose Luis Garcia's food store in an affluent neighborhood here. Mr. Garcia immediately reaches for his wallet.
''They first say there is some fine and then they say, 'We can fix this another way,' '' said Mr. Garcia, who typically pays $50 to $100 to make the inspectors go away.
It is an article of faith here that the fastest way to resolve difficulties with a health inspector, traffic police officer or nettlesome ministry functionary is to pay a sum under the table. 
A baroque bureaucracy, something economists have long warned slows the potential for growth here, and low pay for public servants leads to peso-greased shortcuts for the simplest transactions.
The bigger the project, experts say, the more palms that are likely to spread open.
''Although you may have all your permits, they say you have to contribute something,'' said Salvador Contreras, a contractor on an office building going up on a major boulevard. ''If you do it the normal way or without paying, it can take double the normal time to do anything.''
As deep as the bribery, as well as the resulting frustration, is the acceptance. So the report in The New York Times over the weekend that Wal-Mart de Mexico had paid bribes to speed up the expansion of its empire here and then sought to cover up the payments came as no surprise. What raised eyebrows were the amounts involved -- more than $24 million -- and that the surreptitious behavior, which Mexicans are confronted with on a much smaller scale in their everyday lives, was so publicly revealed.
''They learned all the bad tricks here,'' Carlos Salas, a food stand vendor who himself admits to paying off municipal inspectors, said of the executives of Wal-Mart.
Fiscal watchdogs chafe at the way bribery and other forms of corruption are taken in stride here. Studies have found it costs the economy upward of $114 billion -- 10 percent of its gross domestic product -- and dampens potential investment.
The Mexican chapter of Transparency International said corruption over all was on the rise in Mexico and last year ranked it 100 out of 183 countries in its perception of corruption index, and last among the 34 countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
A study in January by Global Financial Integrity, a research group in Washington, said Mexico over all had lost $872 billion between 1970 to 2010 to crime, corruption and tax evasion, with an acceleration of losses since the North American Free Trade Agreement began in 1994 and ushered in a wave of foreign investment.
''It is very much a part of business,'' said Heather Lowe, legal counsel for the group. ''It is an international business issue, but it hits Mexico significantly.''
''What our report showed,'' she added, ''is a disregard for the rule of the law among a lot of the business community in Mexico, whether it is to evade taxes or engage in bribery or other crimes. There is a general disregard for the law in Mexico, and American law, too.''
Mexico is the only developing country that shares a border with a major industrial democracy, making temptation go both ways, she said.
While Mexican bribery investigations are few and far between -- government officials here have promised to look into the Wal-Mart allegations -- American prosecutors have sought to crack down in recent years, using a 1977 law that bars American companies from paying bribes abroad.
In May, a California company and two of its executives were convicted on conspiracy charges for bribing a Mexican electric utility executive with a yacht, Ferrari and other goods in exchange for contracts. And last month Bizjet agreed to pay $11.8 million to settle charges it bribed Mexican and Panamanian officials to win aircraft maintenance work from government agencies.
But promised reforms in Mexico never seem to take root, with a justice system rife with impunity and botched and delayed investigations. On top of the business-related bribes are the drug-related ones, in which members of organized crime groups buy off police officers or politicians to look the other way.
''We have good laws,'' Luis Carlos Ugalde, a Mexican political scientist, wrote in Nexos magazine last year, in a lengthy dissection of corruption in Mexico and impediments to cleaning it up. ''But they do not have an effect on the real world of corruption.''
A report in October by the O.E.C.D. said Mexico needed to make criminal enforcement of foreign bribery a priority.
Occasionally, street vendors and the other Mexican merchants rebel. A few years ago, a group of vendors near a busy subway station got together and decided against paying off ''leaders,'' who in turn say that they pay off city officials. So far, they have remained, but other vendors still pay bribe money out of fear of a crackdown.

HEADLINE: In Bangladesh, a Quick Evolution From Backwater to Growth Center

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
COX'S BAZAR, Bangladesh -- Bangladesh is probably one of the last places in Asia people would expect to see a thriving beachside resort with luxury hotels.
And yet, Cox's Bazar is exactly that -- a place where affluent Bangladeshis go for a weekend of seaside fun. During the high season, when the monsoon rains are not pounding the country, the beach is filled with children and their watchful parents among slightly dilapidated orange beach umbrellas.
About five years ago, only a few luxury hotels were in this small city on the Bay of Bengal. Now there are a dozen, and counting. Smaller hotels and guesthouses are proliferating, and property prices have risen sharply.
The transformation of Cox's Bazar from remote backwater to a beach El Dorado encapsulates the changes that have taken place in this country of 160 million people, and many other developing Asian countries, over the last couple of decades. 
''A middle class is gradually forming,'' said Zahid Hossain, principal economist at the Asian Development Bank in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. The growth in the country mirrors the developments in other emerging economies, he said. ''Domestic demand is growing and becoming an important driver of economic activity.''
The progress, though, has been uneven. As in other Asian countries, the gap between rich and poor has widened in Bangladesh, giving rise to social tensions and sometimes violent protests. The murder this month of Aminul Islam, a prominent labor rights activist, apparently in retaliation for his advocacy work, put a spotlight on the low wages and poor working conditions that prevail in burgeoning sectors like the garment industry.
In Bangladesh's countryside, home to more than 70 percent of the population, subsistence farming remains the norm, and weather-related disasters regularly wreak havoc in the flat lowlands.
Foreign direct investment in Bangladesh has languished at about $1 billion a year -- less than what Albania or Belarus each receive, and about one-tenth of foreign investments in Thailand or Malaysia. Inadequate power and transportation infrastructures, political infighting, bureaucracy, corruption and a shortage of skilled laborers contribute to a challenging investment climate.
Yet despite this, the Bangladeshi economy has managed to grow more than 6 percent a year for much of the last decade.
Economists at Standard Chartered Bank believe that Bangladesh could join what have been called the ''7 percent club'' of economies that expand at least 7 percent annually for an extended period -- allowing their economies to double every decade. Current members of the ''club'' include China, Cambodia, India, Mozambique and Uganda.
HSBC included Bangladesh in a group of 26 economies -- along with China, India and several Latin American and African countries -- where it expects particularly strong growth. The United States and much of Europe, by contrast, are likely to remain merely stable, according to HSBC's projections.
The gradual shift in global production to low-cost countries, from developed economies in Europe and North America, is driving much of that growth. The trend, which began turning parts of Asia -- notably China -- into manufacturing hubs in the 1980s and 1990s, has started to take root in Bangladesh.
For now, Bangladesh's manufacturing prowess is primarily focused on the garment sector, which has grown into a multibillion-dollar industry that employs 3.6 million people and accounts for 78 percent of the country's exports.
Bangladesh has seen particularly strong growth in the last few years, partly because of rising labor costs in China, where manufacturing is moving into higher-margin activities like product design.
''For many years, China was almost always the hands-down answer to all buyers' needs,'' the consulting firm McKinsey noted in a recent report. Now, Western wholesale buyers of garments are looking for the ''next China,'' and Bangladesh ''is clearly the preferred next stop for the sourcing caravan.''
Bangladesh exported nearly $18 billion worth of garments in the 12 months through June 2011, $10.5 billion of that to the European Union and $4.6 billion to the United States, according to the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association. The total nearly doubled from four years earlier, and McKinsey forecast that the garment industry would grow by as much as 9 percent a year over the next decade.
Li & Fung, a giant Hong Kong trading company that supplies retailers including Walmart with clothing mostly purchased from Asia, is a case in point. Last year, the company bought $1 billion worth of apparel from manufacturers in Bangladesh, 41 percent more than in 2010. Bangladesh overtook Vietnam and Indonesia in 2011 to become the second-largest source of such products for Li & Fung, after China.
But infrastructure bottlenecks and power cuts are substantial ''negatives,'' Bruce Rockowitz, chief executive of Li & Fung, said at a recent news conference in Hong Kong. Still, the company intends to increase the business it does in Bangladesh. ''The prognosis,'' Mr. Rockowitz said, ''is good.''
Another driver of economic growth has been the inflow of remittances -- money sent home by Bangladeshis who have sought employment abroad. More than $11 billion worth of remittances flowed into Bangladesh last year, more than 10 times the amount from foreign investment, and the annual inflow is expected to rise to $20 billion in five years' time, the government estimates.
Of course, the fact that tens of thousands of Bangladeshis go abroad each year highlights a weakness in the country's economy: well-paid jobs are hard to come by.
Manufacturing is mostly confined to low-level, fairly unskilled assembly work, rather than to high-end production or design. Moreover, ''other sectors, such as shipbuilding and pharmaceuticals, are only just starting to emerge,'' said Agost Benard, who covers Bangladesh for the ratings agency Standard & Poor's.
Still, the expansion of the past few years and improvements in the agriculture sector mean that domestic demand is growing.
Dhaka, whose population has ballooned to about 15 million, now has car showrooms and a small but growing number of high-end international hotels. Monthly office rents in the most sought-after neighborhoods of the capital can be as high as 250 taka per square foot, or about $3 -- levels that would not look out of place in some Western cities, according to the real estate services firm Jones Lang LaSalle.
In Cox's Bazar, construction sites pockmark the once laid-back beachfront. A Best Western hotel is in the making. Green Delta Housing, a Bangladeshi construction company, is working on several developments. Carlson Rezidor Hotel Group, which already operates a Radisson in Dhaka, is planning to open two hotels in Cox's Bazar in 2015.
The town is a long way from turning into Cancun, Mexico, or the Cote d'Azur in France. Rickshaws trundle along the potholed road between the small airport and the hotel zone farther south, where shopkeepers sell dried fish and sunglasses, and rickety stalls on the beach sell souvenirs crafted from seashells.
''This is not 'Baywatch' or Hawaii,'' said Mikey Leung, a co-author of the Bradt travel guide to Bangladesh. ''You're not talking international-style resorts.''
But Cox's Bazar has changed a great deal over the past five years, Mr. Leung said. ''Properties are popping up like daisies, and the development is moving further and further down along the beach. The speed and scale of it is unprecedented for Bangladesh.''
Moniruzzaman, a marketing executive at the Cox's Bazar office of Green Delta Housing who uses only one name, concurred.
''Many, many things are happening,'' he said. ''Land is like gold now.''

HEADLINE: Even in a Prime Neighborhood, Some Forlorn Vacancies

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH A. HARRIS

 BODY:
As you walk east on 82nd Street with the Metropolitan Museum of Art at your back, Madison Avenue up ahead and lavish homes all around, you might not notice the pretty, pink town house on the south side of the street, No. 12. Its brick facade and white marble base seem perfectly at ease in the neighborhood, but if you stop for a moment and look up, you will see that several windows on the face of this fine building, on this most pristine block, are shattered.
The facade is dingy, the doors look worn and oddly askew, and the windows are clouded with dust. And if you peer through the mail slot, you will find that something crucial is missing: the entire back wall of the building.
At that, it becomes clear that nobody has been home in many years. 
The Upper East Side is one of the most sought-after neighborhoods in New York City, an area where a $10 million apartment does not raise an eyebrow. Buildings are perfectly appointed, and even the tulips are arranged in precise, color-coordinated bunches.
Yet on some of the city's greatest blocks, there are buildings sitting empty, or nearly so, seemingly forgotten by their owners as their elegance and detail are sanded away by time. As it turns out, even the Upper East Side has its Grey Gardens. Here are two examples:
12 East 82nd Street
''The rain goes right through it,'' said Johanna Van Straaten, who looks out onto the back of 12 East 82nd Street from her office on 81st Street. ''I put up flowers in my window so I wouldn't have to look at the building.''
Her puffy, purple hydrangeas make a cheerful effort, but they are really not up to the task.
The back of No. 12 is five stories of jagged bricks, exposed beams and a sad blue tarp, shredded as if by desperate animals, hanging halfheartedly across a few yards of the open building.
''It just looks like it's getting worse every year,'' Ms. Van Straaten said.
Several complaints were lodged about No. 12 with the Department of Buildings in 2009 and 2010, including such objections as ''house have no back'' and ''garden wall is missing,'' as though it had wandered off to visit the museum and gotten lost somewhere in the American Wing. But after 2010, the calls stopped coming.
''I complained to the Buildings Department,'' said Annemarie Levitt, who has lived on the block for 60 years. ''They just don't do anything.''
It was not always this way at No. 12, of course. The 19th-century town house, a part of the Metropolitan Museum Historic District, was bought for $14 million as recently as 2006 by Janna Bullock, a Russian-born real estate developer and regular on the New York City social scene.
The following year, the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission approved plans to alter the property, which included major changes to the back of the building. The work began, but when the economy plunged, the permits were not renewed.
Repeated attempts to contact Ms. Bullock last week, both directly and through her representative, were unsuccessful.
Ryan FitzGibbon, a spokeswoman for the Buildings Department, said that as long as a site was structurally sound and was sealed off from the public, the department did not require that it be sealed off from the elements. The department investigated each of the complaints about the open back, Ms. FitzGibbon said, and issued one violation.
The landmarks commission, however, is somewhat more finicky. It is unhappy when its buildings are rained into.
''We visited the site two years ago after getting a complaint about the missing rear wall,'' a commission spokeswoman, Elisabeth de Bourbon, said in an e-mail. ''The owner assured us at the time it would be replaced. We just spoke to a neighbor who confirmed that it is indeed still missing.''
Ms. de Bourbon said the owner would be receiving a notice of violation.
Ms. Bullock also owns a town house next door, 14 East 82nd Street, which she bought in 2005 for $12.2 million. That building is currently host to an exhibition of her art, called ''Allegories and Experiences.'' It appears to have maintained all four of its walls.
890 Park Avenue
''We're talking about the most expensive places to live in the entire city,'' Tara Kelly, executive director of Friends of the Upper East Side Historic Districts, said as she strolled up Park Avenue on a bright afternoon. ''Any one of these buildings could be filled with the wealthiest families in the city, with the names we all know.''
When she reached 890 Park Avenue, however, the odds of running into a billionaire became slimmer.
Sandwiched between dapper prewar buildings, between 78th and 79th Streets, this lonely Victorian town house is streaked with dirt and worn with age, like a fading gentleman in a tattered old dinner jacket. Every one of the building's front windows is caked with dust. A layer of brownstone on the first floor is crumbling into soft, pinkish piles on the sidewalk. Weeds a foot high spring from the corner of its pointed roof.
''It's vacant?'' suggested Bob Brull, who works in a building one block south. ''Vacant for a long time?''
Not exactly.
''I'm in Apartment 4R,'' said Elliot Spencer Turgen, 84, the last remaining resident in the building.
Mr. Turgen moved into a rent-controlled one-bedroom apartment in 1967, when his rent was $121 per month and the building was bustling with other tenants. He declined to say how much he paid today.
''We were quite close,'' Mr. Turgen said of his relationship with his former neighbors. But at some point, he continued, successive landlords stopped finding new tenants for empty apartments, and by the late 1990s he was one of the last residents remaining.
''The building is not in great shape,'' Mr. Turgen said, ''but it's not a run-down building. It's just that all the apartments are empty, and I don't know why.''
The building's owner, Walter Schick, who owns other properties around the city, bought the building about 15 years ago when it was in foreclosure. With nothing to compel him to rent out the empty units, he said, he has been waiting (and waiting, and waiting) until the property is vacant to rehabilitate it.
This year, Mr. Schick won possession of the only other occupied apartment in the building, a rent-stabilized unit on the third floor, and now that Mr. Turgen is the only tenant left, Mr. Schick said he hoped to start the renovations this summer. While many landlords keep apartments empty if they want to sell a building or convert it into a co-op, Mr. Schick's son, Joseph Schick, said their plan was to keep the building and rent it out once the work was done.
Neighbors and passers-by say they, too, hope the renovations get under way soon so they can see the building return to some of its former glory, and perhaps even buffed to match the sheen of its neighbors.
''It just needs a little love,'' said Denise Musa-Sullivan, a nurse at Lenox Hill Hospital who passes 890 Park Avenue on her way to work every day.
''Hey, this is Park Avenue. It doesn't get any better than this.''

HEADLINE: N.Y.U. Reaches a Deal With the City to Create a School of Applied Science in Brooklyn

BYLINE: By PATRICK MCGEEHAN

 BODY:
It took 14 speakers and an 11-page news release on Monday to spread the news that city officials had struck a deal for New York University to create a school of applied science in Downtown Brooklyn.
The agreement, which has been in the works for months, would end years of debate about what to do with the old headquarters of the city's transit authority at 370 Jay Street. The Metropolitan Transportation Authority had largely abandoned the 61-year-old building, transferring many of its occupants to other offices in Manhattan.
To move the transit authority's equipment and remaining employees out, N.Y.U. promised to pay $50 million of the relocation costs. It also agreed to pay as much as $10 million to move the New York Police Department out of some space it occupies in the building. 
In exchange, the city agreed to rent the building for $1 a year to N.Y.U., a private university with an endowment of $2.5 billion. The city also offered a $15 million package of breaks on taxes and energy costs and possibly some cash.
Asked why public property would essentially be turned over to a private university that charges more than $40,000 a year for tuition, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said that the public would benefit from having the school built in the hub of Brooklyn.
N.Y.U. ''is putting their cash on the line,'' the mayor said. ''We should be saying thank you to them.''
And many elected officials and business leaders lined up behind the mayor to do just that. As he spoke at a lectern in the lobby of the Polytechnic Institute of New York University's building across from 370 Jay Street, he was flanked by nearly three dozen people who were given credit for having helped in some way.
Several of them were leaders of universities that formed a consortium to bid in the competition that the city's Economic Development Corporation set up to establish a graduate school of applied science. Mr. Bloomberg saw that project as a solution to the city's inability to compete with Silicon Valley for engineering and science talent.
Cornell University, in partnership with the Technion school in Israel, won the competition with a plan to build a $2 billion campus on Roosevelt Island. But the group led by N.Y.U. forged ahead with its plan to create a smaller school in Brooklyn. The other schools involved are NYU-Poly, the City University of New York, Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Warwick, the University of Toronto and the Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay.
N.Y.U. officials did not say how much they expected to spend on the venture. But John Beckman, a spokesman for N.Y.U., said the consortium would spend as much as $750 per square foot to gut and renovate the building - if it determined that the project was feasible. The group plans to create the center even if it decides that the transit agency's building is not suitable, he said.
On Monday, a notice taped to the wall of the building's lobby warned entrants that work was under way to remove asbestos. Outside, the building's lower facade was obscured from view by scaffolding that has been in place for years.
Marty Markowitz, the always-on borough president of Brooklyn, proclaimed that ''370 Jay Street will no longer be an eyesore to Downtown Brooklyn.''
But officials of the Transit Workers Union were not so thrilled when they heard about the deal. ''It's a win-win for everyone but transit riders, who are still feeling the horrendous effects of the massive service cuts the M.T.A. engaged in in 2010,'' said John Samuelsen, president of Local 100, which represents 40,000 transit workers.
Mr. Samuelsen said the transit authority should have renovated the Jay Street building instead of moving into more expensive quarters in Lower Manhattan and reducing service. But transit officials, who approved the transaction with N.Y.U. at a meeting on Monday, said it would have cost more than $200 million to modernize the building in Brooklyn.
City officials provided lofty estimates of the benefits the city would reap from the school, which is expected to start up next year in rented space nearby and move into the building in 2017. Mr. Bloomberg said the project would yield more than 2,000 construction jobs and that over 30 years, it would generate more than $5.5 billion in economic activity and $597 million in tax revenue.
If all that comes true, the time and effort expended to wrangle the deal to fruition will have been worthwhile, said Daniel L. Squadron, a Democratic state senator.
''With the number of people up here and the amount of time this took, we could have built a new building,'' Mr. Squadron said, gesturing toward the assemblage standing two and three deep behind him. ''Rarely has one building been so hard to make work.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: New Albums From Jack White, Sarah Jaffe and Kenny Garrett

BYLINE: By BEN RATLIFF, JON PARELES and NATE CHINEN

 BODY:
JACK WHITE
''Blunderbuss'' (Columbia)
The good news is that Jack White's first solo album sounds ruled by his real-time nervous system. He's made an album of impetuousness and instinctive design. He's allowed first-take buzzes and imperfections, created whole songs out of small and fast notions.
Forcible freshness protection is his first talent. Parts of the making of ''Blunderbuss'' have looked like an aesthetic health regimen: releasing a single on flexi-disc by means of helium balloon from the doors of his Nashville record-label office, as he did on April 1; forming separate male and female bands and taking both on tour, then calling on each at his whim; arranging an overwrought, almost violent ode to love -- that would be this album's ''Love Interruption'' -- for Wurlitzer organ, clarinet and shaky vocal harmony. 
Strange, then, that the excellent ingredients don't make the album better. Something's missing. Mr. White essentially directed the White Stripes from 1997 to 2007 as its singer, guitarist, songwriter and producer. He then went on to other bands in which he had a less dominating role, the Raconteurs and the Dead Weather, and he's produced several dozen vinyl singles and albums, with the resources of his own studio and label, Third Man. But ''Blunderbuss'' is the work that seems to come closest to his own vision since the close of the White Stripes, and it can help bring into focus what made the older group so good.
Here, on ''Blunderbuss,'' is Mr. White's electric guitar sound, digitally altered and cartoonishly flexible, set off from the archaisms he likes to put around him; here's his singing, high and intense; there's his production, with big cymbals and big reverb. What's not here so much is the mysterious, paramusical part: the sense of occasion, the strength of the gesture.
Granted, it's a categorically different project. With the White Stripes, economy of scale gave him a built-in organizing principle and a kind of critical distance. They slayed within fixed limits, using aspects of blues, rockabilly, punk and glam-rock to perform, essentially, disruptions and meta-commentaries. ''Blunderbuss'' isn't arch like that. It isn't so into radical juxtapositions. It's not severe; it's familiar and welcoming: when soft (the slithering ''On and On and On''), when loud (the Stripesy ''Sixteen Saltines'') and when medium (the country-rock waltz ''I Guess I Should Go to Sleep''). For an artist so heavily into artifice this album breathes the easier air of classic rock and old country music; much of it feels relaxed, almost natural.
Few songs on ''Blunderbuss'' truly knock the wind out of you, as the White Stripes could -- even with riffs that were fragmentary, simple or borrowed. This is a songwriter's record, and a kind of orchestrator's record; there's also a new overall vehemence in the lyrics, hammering on dishonesty, jealousy, immorality. (''Who the hell's impressed by you?'' he sings in ''Hypocritical Kiss.'' ''I want names of the people/that we know that are falling for this.'') But the meat of the songs -- riffs, chord progressions, dynamic shifts -- feels less distinguished.
The mainstays of the record's players are members of what will be the female touring band, including the drummer Carla Azar of the Los Angeles band Autolux, the acoustic upright bassist Bryn Davies and the pianist Brooke Waggoner. Others pass in and out, Nashville musicians of different kinds: the country session-player Fats Kaplin, Lillie Mae Rische of the country-rock band Jypsi, the guitarist Jake Orrall from the garagey duo Jeff the Brotherhood. It's both a core band record and an extended-cast record, and maybe that's part of the problem: Despite all Mr. White's small good ideas, it doesn't have a big, binding, group-sound one.
So I find myself looking for great moments. ''Weep Themselves to Sleep'' has one of the best: a guitar solo by Mr. White that's actually a pair of them, one in each channel, itchy and needling, fighting one another. And his version of Little Willie John's ''I'm Shakin','' the record's only cover, is one long great moment: overdriven, exacting, uptight, unnatural. BEN RATLIFF
SARAH JAFFE
''The Body Wins'' (Kirtland)
Sarah Jaffe doesn't get specific about back stories in the songs on ''The Body Wins,'' her second album, but one thing is clear: They're not placid.
Ms. Jaffe, a songwriter from Denton, Tex., was mostly folky and straightforward on her 2010 debut album, ''Suburban Nature,'' singing about longing, pain, falling apart and surviving despite herself. This time the lyrics are splintered, though they still hint at bitter aftermaths of romance and addiction. ''There's always a point, a point of no return/Always something to give up, always something to learn,'' she sings in ''Mannequin Woman,'' which plugs along, dark but poppy, like Fleetwood Mac's ''Dreams.''
Her voice holds a wounded determination. It's full of scrapes and quavers, and capable of both Fiona Apple's acidity and Feist's suppleness (though sometimes she's overly close to Feist).
For this album Ms. Jaffe largely set aside her guitar. Her new songs can turn orchestral, head for big (but troubled) choruses or blast into rock as she does in ''Talk,'' which piles buzz-bomb electric guitars onto a sparse electro beat. She and her producer, John Congleton, come up with barbed pop structures like ''The Body Wins,'' a tangolike rocker with muscular brass and shards of dissonance, and ''Glorified High,'' which uses blotchy distortion for its beat and bass line on the way to an accusatory, mock-triumphal chorus.
She shows a quieter side too, but without getting conventionally folky. There are somber piano marches, like ''The Way Sound Leaves a Room''; a string section backs her in ''Foggy Field,'' as she gently sings, ''Sometimes second chances haunt me.'' In ''Fangs'' an arrangement with clarinets and saxophone hints at the warmth of the Band, and Ms. Jaffe overdubs herself into a choir. But she's singing, ''Water to wine/She's got fangs like mine.'' There's no unmixed sweetness on this album, only partly healed scars.
JON PARELES
KENNY GARRETT
''Seeds From the
Underground''
(Mack Avenue)
The alto and soprano saxophonist Kenny Garrett acknowledges many sources of inspiration on his engagingly robust new album, ''Seeds From the Underground.'' Most of the acknowledgments are fairly obvious: a postbop workout called ''J. Mac'' is for the saxophonist Jackie McLean, and an urgent waltz called ''Haynes Here'' is for the drummer Roy Haynes. ''Detroit'' is a tribute to Mr. Garrett's hometown; ''Welcome Earth Song'' concerns his home planet.
There's a sincere motive behind all this naming. Mr. Garrett, 51, seems eager to attest to the influences, both personal and environmental, that made him the artist he is. More, then: ''Du-Wo-Mo,'' is for Duke Ellington, Woody Shaw and Thelonious Monk; ''Wiggins'' refers to an old band teacher. But what about his former mentor, Miles Davis? Or his lodestar, John Coltrane? He's made each one the focus of a previous album, which would seem to suffice.
Still, it's hard to put Coltrane far out of mind here. Mr. Garrett's sound is tart and gusty, bordering on perfervid, but with a pinpoint-accurate expenditure of energy. Like Coltrane he's an expert in strategies of escalation, often worrying a melodic phrase into a mantra, and then a rant, before drawing down again.
He has also groomed his sidemen to evoke Coltrane's 1960s quartet: Benito Gonzalez has a forcefully oblique piano style derived from McCoy Tyner, and Ronald Bruner pummels his drums with a polyrhythmic fury descended from Elvin Jones. So what separates this album from historical re-enactment is twofold: the attitude and the material.
Mr. Garrett has a taste for funkiness in his writing, even when he leaves no trace of a backbeat (but especially when he does). The better of these compositions suggest the pithy durability and deceptive simplicity of folk songs. This can backfire, as it does on ''Welcome Earth Song,'' with a melody as grating as a car alarm, made all the more so by its group vocals (singing the title phrase, ad nauseam).
It's clear that the band -- which also features the bassist Nat Reeves and the percussionist Rudy Bird, and will appear Thursday through Saturday at the Iridium -- has a comfort zone. The promise of melodic abstraction held out by ''Ballad Jarrett,'' for the pianist Keith Jarrett, leaves everyone sounding a little strained, Mr. Gonzalez especially. But what this group does well, it does commandingly, which means Mr. Garrett is reaping his own rewards.

HEADLINE: Mexico Reins In Oil Monopoly

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

 BODY:
COATZINTLA, Mexico -- For seven decades, Pemex, Mexico's state-owned oil monopoly and a mainstay of the government's revenue, regulated itself -- which is a polite way of saying it could do pretty much as it pleased.
No authority challenged the wisdom of investments like the billions it has spent here in the Chicontepec oil field to extract just a trickle of petroleum even as private companies have pulled torrents from similar shale rock in Texas and North Dakota.
The company's safety procedures went largely unscrutinized as it joined the oil majors drilling in deepwater areas of the Gulf of Mexico. And the company faced no serious consequences for not keeping its promises to raise output or operate more efficiently.
But in the last few years, that has begun to change. The tiny National Hydrocarbons Commission, created by the Mexican Congress in 2008 to increase regulatory oversight of the company, is proving to be a surprisingly sharp thorn in Pemex's side. 
The five-member panel of energy specialists, which has a staff of 61 and an annual budget of about $7 million, has begun to confront the company's executives over where and how they drill for oil. With a raft of new regulations and its own blunt assessments of the practicality of Pemex's projects, the commission is pushing the company to explain its plans.
Pemex does not have to follow the regulators' recommendations, but the commission's young president, Juan Carlos Zepeda, is speaking out when it does not.
''The strength of the commission is in public opinion,'' said Mr. Zepeda, 42, an economist who contends that Pemex, officially Petroleos Mexicanos, should be more transparent as it spends $20 billion this year to find and pump oil. ''The force of change will come from Congress, from opinion leaders, from national universities, from society.''
As a symbol of Mexican nationalism, created in 1938 when the government expropriated foreign-owned oil companies, Pemex occupies a peculiar place in the country's energy policy. The jobs it generates give it powerful political allies, and its union is so strong that no president risks defying it.
The government relies on the company's oil revenue for as much as 40 percent of the national budget, taxing it so heavily that last year the company lost $6.5 billion on sales of $111.5 billion.
As long as oil gushed from Pemex's giant offshore fields, there seemed little reason for anyone to challenge the status quo. But production has declined since 2004, and the company's ability to find and exploit new sources of oil has been cast into doubt.
The commission has closely tracked the Chicontepec project, on which Pemex has already spent nearly $9 billion. The regulators told the company that in its haste to meet ambitious production goals, it was drilling hundreds of new wells without studying the region's geology or the best recovery techniques.
The criticism was quickly picked up by members of Congress.
Mr. Zepeda is also scrutinizing Pemex's plans to push deeper into the Gulf of Mexico. The memory of the BP disaster there in 2010 is still fresh, and Mr. Zepeda is concerned that Pemex does not have enough experience to drill three new exploratory wells at depths of almost 10,000 feet -- more than twice the average depths it has been drilling in the region.
David Shields, an independent oil analyst based in Mexico City, said the change in approach was significant. ''It was heresy in the past to question whether Pemex was doing things properly,'' Mr. Shields said. The commission's five members all had previously worked for Pemex or for government entities involved in energy. But their decisions have shown independence, said Miriam Grunstein, an oil specialist at the CIDE, a public research university in Mexico City.
''They have integrity,'' Ms. Grunstein said. ''They're really admirable. It's completely unexpected.''
In the last few weeks, Pemex and the chief of its production and exploration subsidiary, Carlos Morales Gil, have begun responding to the pressure. The company officially reduced its estimate for probable reserves in Chicontepec by about 30 percent, to 6.49 billion barrels of oil equivalent, ending two years of wrangling with Mr. Zepeda's team.
Then, at the end of March, Pemex announced that it had signed a contract with Wild Well Control, a Houston company that handles oil well disasters, including the 2010 BP spill, to provide deepwater containment systems, and it is in talks with a consortium of gulf oil companies to provide additional services. Pemex is also analyzing whether it should buy additional insurance for the deepwater wells, Mr. Morales said.
Jeremy Martin, the director of the energy program at the Institute of the Americas in the La Jolla neighborhood of San Diego, said that Mr. Zepeda was right to take his concerns about Pemex public. ''He is holding their feet to the fire, especially Carlos Morales. At a minimum, he is forcing Morales to respond.''
Mr. Zepeda said he sensed the beginning of a shift at the company but added, ''for Pemex to fully recognize an authority, it will take a cultural change that is going to take some time.''
Mr. Morales of Pemex expressed exasperation with the commission's oversight.
''It is like being the coach of the national soccer team,'' he said in an interview. ''Everybody wants to tell the coach what to do.''
Mr. Morales suggested that some of the guarantees that the commission wants from Pemex before the company begins drilling in deeper waters reflect the commission's inexperience.
''We have been doing these things for 70 years,'' he said.
But Ms. Grunstein said that Pemex's efforts in deep water had little to do with sound business management. ''They want to prove to Mexicans and to the world that they can do it,'' she said. ''It's a heavily reputational thing.''
Although Pemex does not have the experience to easily develop unconventional fields like Chicontepec, where the oil is tightly locked in the rock, it has no choice. The Mexican Constitution prevents Pemex from doing what would be standard practice anywhere else in the world -- striking partnerships with private companies to share costs and revenue.
Some positive news has occurred. Pemex's oil production has stabilized at about 2.5 million barrels a day, down from the 2004 peak of 3.4 million. This year, Pemex will finally replace each barrel it produces with a new barrel of proven reserves, a goal that had long eluded it.
And a new boss, Antonio Narvaez Ramirez, is in charge at Chicontepec, where 2,100 oil wells are spread over low hills covered with orange groves and cattle pastures. Mr. Narvaez has spent 18 months overhauling operations and adopting many of the commission's suggestions.
''Pemex is used to doing things in a conventional way because the oil fields were conventional,'' he said. ''But that's finished, and we have to go against the conventions.''
When Mr. Narvaez arrived, he monitored the wells with different colored Post-it notes on a wall. Now he has a computerized system to transmit production information in real time to his tablet computer.
Some of his changes are low-tech but effective, including keeping a fleet of maintenance trucks that can be deployed immediately to fix most of the mechanical problems in an oil pump. Others are more complex, including new types of well design to permit horizontal drilling and multistage hydraulic fracturing.
The subsequent impact on the local community is just beginning. ''There is more movement, more jobs,'' said Marisol Tapia Rodelo, 29, who runs a roadside restaurant in the village of Palma Sola, where giant trucks operated by Pemex and its contractors rumble by and workers turn up every lunchtime.
Chicontepec's production, now about 65,000 barrels of crude oil a day, is rising, although the goal Pemex now cites -- 300,000 barrels -- is far off.
''In the end, we will learn how to produce in the field,'' Mr. Zepeda said. ''The shame is that it cost a lot of money. The learning curve is too expensive.''

HEADLINE: China Extends Reach Into International Art

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

 BODY:
SHANGHAI -- China's drive to achieve world status in more than just economic power has now turned to art museums, a push that is also resulting in the showing of more Chinese art in the United States.
Here, in the nation's financial center, the city government recently gave its blessing to a museum of contemporary art to be called an ''art palace'' -- actually an expansion of the China Pavilion of the 2010 World Expo -- that will bring the space to some 2.1 million square feet. The project will make it the largest art museum in China and will put it among the largest in the world when it opens on Oct. 1, said Li Lei, the executive director of the Shanghai Art Museum, which will move into the new art palace.
Not to be outdone, the National Art Museum of China in Beijing is holding an international competition to choose the architect for a structure of almost 1.4 million square feet to be built next to one of the capital's new landmarks, the National Olympic Stadium. The three finalists are the American architect Frank Gehry, the Iraqi-born Zaha Hadid and the French architect Jean Nouvel. 
This lineup points to a world-class design, eventually, even if it is a bit smaller than Shanghai's, Fan Di'an, the director of the National Art Museum, said in an interview. ''I would like a design that grows out of the Beijing soil,'' said Mr. Fan, who is on the 11-member judging panel. The winner will be announced in several months.
The boom in museum construction, which some Chinese art experts liken to the expansion of museums in the United States at the end of the 19th century, has much to do with national pride. It comes with the full support of the national government as part of a cultural strategy known as ''Going Out, Inviting In,'' under which the government is giving its blessing to museums' taking the initiative in offering an array of modern Chinese art for show abroad, including in the United States.
At the same time, the tone has changed from what used to be fairly blatant use of Chinese culture as state propaganda to a more sophisticated approach, Chinese and American museum directors say. In this spirit, individual museums in China, particularly art museums, are exerting more of their own leadership and relying less on central authorities to approve what they can send and show abroad.
Thus a collaboration between the Shanghai Art Museum and Asia Society in New York is behind a show of 54 ink-on-paper works by Wu Guanzhong that opens in New York on Tuesday. A Chinese artist who trained in Paris after World War II, Wu then turned to using ancient techniques of brush and ink on a large scale and in a contemporary manner.
The genesis for the exhibition came in 2008, when the director of Asia Society Museum, Melissa Chiu, visited a retrospective of Wu's work at the Shanghai Art Museum. The idea evolved with the cooperation of Mr. Li, the museum's director, and the artist, whom Ms. Chiu visited at his studio in Beijing; he died in June 2010 at 90.
Wu, whose works are among the top earners in the rarefied auction world of modern Chinese art, gave a large number of works to the museum for the 2008 retrospective show and for its permanent collection. One of his Yangtze River landscapes from the early 1970s fetched $23.5 million at auction in Beijing last year.
Wu's art appeals to Chinese collectors partly because, in contrast to some of the high-selling avant-garde artists who went to the West after the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution and adapted Western trends, Wu returned to Chinese tradition. Mr. Li said he hoped Wu could be a bridge between the two cultures for American art lovers.
The choice of works for Asia Society was a joint effort between her and Mr. Li, Ms. Chiu said. The two museums shared the costs, with the Chinese paying for all framing, packing and shipping, a welcome contribution in an era of austere budgets, she said.
''I haven't heard of the Chinese government paying those costs before, so this is a new chapter in the China-U.S. art relationship,'' she added.
Another partnership, between the Nanjing Museum and the Cleveland Museum of Art brought the works of Fu Baoshi, a 20th-century master ink painter, to American audiences. The show was expanded for display at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, where it closed this month.
Last year 395 museums were built across China, according to Chen Jianming, a vice chairman of the Chinese Society of Museums and the director of the Hunan Provincial Museum. Many of these new museums were devoted to history, but in the years ahead, many more art museums are planned, he said.
But the new urgency for more and bigger museums may be coming too fast, Mr. Chen added. There are not enough trained personnel to build collections and oversee educational programs, and some new museums will not have sufficiently high-standard collections, he said.
''I have a conservative viewpoint -- a museum is not just a fancy big building,'' Mr. Chen said, as lines of people waited outside his museum in the provincial capital, Changsha, to see 2,100-year-old antiquities, including the well-preserved mummified body of a Han dynasty noblewoman. ''Museums are for the collections, and it takes a long time to build them.''
Mr. Chen said it was possible that a new Changsha Art Museum designed by Zaha Hadid would not be built because it was not clear whether enough support facilities were incorporated into the design.
As the number of art museums grows, Chinese curators are increasingly eager to show their art in the United States.
Last week, on his way to New York for the opening of the Wu Guanzhong show, Mr. Li flew first to Washington to talk to curators there about possible collaborations with the Shanghai Art Museum.
Last year Mr. Fan of the National Art Museum of China suggested a show of 20th-century Chinese art that the Chinese would have paid for at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, said Maxwell K. Hearn, the Metropolitan's chief curator of Asian art.
But the Metropolitan plans its shows years in advance and did not have space in the schedule for the early date Mr. Fan proposed. Moreover, Mr. Hearn said, he was not willing to accept a catalog that was entirely the work of Chinese curators.
Even so, Mr. Fan said he was heartened that the Wu Guanzhong and Fu Baoshi exhibitions had made their way to major New York museums.
''For the Western point of view, the 20th century is Western art, and the art of Modernism,'' he said. ''I don't think that is fair. These days, when Western scholars discuss modernity, they should also discuss Chinese modernity.''

This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An article on April 24 about a boom in the construction of art museums in China and the showing of more Chinese modern art in the United States referred incorrectly in some instances to Fan Di'an, director of the National Art Museum of China in Beijing, which is holding an international competition to choose the architect for a new building. Fan is his surname and thus he is Mr. Fan, not Mr. Di'an.

PERSON: Bernard Rapoport 

HEADLINE: Bernard Rapoport, 94, Liberal Texas Donor

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Bernard Rapoport, the founder of an insurance company who became a linchpin of the beleaguered community of Texas liberals, died on April 5 in Waco, Tex. He was 94.
His death was confirmed by his granddaughter Abby Rapoport.
A major donor to Democratic candidates, progressive causes, Israel and the University of Texas, Mr. Rapoport called himself a ''capitalist with a conscience,'' using the phrase in the title of a 2002 memoir.
''I have never known anyone who liked to make money as much as he did, and liked to give it away as much as he did,'' said William Cunningham, a former University of Texas chancellor. 
As Texas swung from a Democratic stronghold to an increasingly Republican and conservative state, Mr. Rapoport continued to support liberal Democrats and their causes, both with his money and his extensive national political connections. He was an ally of Ann W. Richards, the state's last Democratic governor, who appointed him to the University of Texas Board of Regents in 1991.
His contributions to George S. McGovern's 1972 presidential campaign put Mr. Rapoport on one of President Richard M. Nixon's enemies lists; contributions to the presidential campaigns of both Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton helped nourish a 40-year friendship. Mr. Clinton is scheduled to deliver a eulogy at a memorial service next month in Washington.
Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, called Mr. Rapoport one of the most progressive corporate executives in the country, adding that Mr. Rapoport often expressed concern about the growth of companies so large that their failure could threaten the nation's economy.
''I can't tell you how many times he started a conversation with, 'What are we going to do about bigness?' '' Mr. Nader said.
Bernard Rapoport was born in San Antonio on July 17, 1917, the son of Russian immigrants; his father had been sent to Siberia in 1905 for taking part in a demonstration in St. Petersburg. He would say: ''My father taught me Marxism and hard work. My mother taught me to love learning.''
At the University of Texas, he was inspired by left-leaning professors of economics, and his thinking would later evolve into New Deal capitalism.
After graduating, Mr. Rapoport met Audre Newman; they celebrated their 70th wedding anniversary in February.
In 1951, he borrowed $25,000 and founded the American Income Life Insurance Company, which marketed itself to labor unions and their members.
He gave millions to the University of Texas for scholarships, and endowed chairs and professorships that focused on human rights and ethics. He gave to causes in Israel that sought accommodation with the Palestinians.
Mr. Rapoport also supported liberal publications like The Nation and The Texas Observer.
Ronnie Dugger, the founding editor of The Observer, recalled visiting Mr. Rapoport in Waco in 1955 to discuss his buying advertising for his insurance company. Mr. Dugger opened their conversation, he said, by stating that since life insurance is based largely on actuarial tables, there was no need for commercial competition, and ''it ought to be nationalized.''
Mr. Rapoport startled him by saying, ''I agree with you.'' He went on to buy ads for decades.
Mr. Rapoport was just as interested in the people working at El Conquistador, his favorite restaurant in Waco, as he was in presidents and power brokers, said Ms. Rapoport, his granddaughter. ''Every waitress got a lecture on why they should be in school,'' she said.
One evening last year at El Conquistador, Mr. Rapoport asked a young family over to his table to chat. Before leaving, he invited Michael Aguilar, then 8, to visit his office. Michael did, showing up in his Cub Scout uniform and bearing a notepad to interview Mr. Rapoport for a scout project.
Mr. Rapoport told him that ''no one's better than him,'' recalled his mother, Maria Aguilar. He also told Michael to read five books a month and report back to him, but Mr. Rapoport died before the follow-up visit could be arranged.
Mr. Rapoport provided financial support to Democratic officeholders in trouble, including Webster L. Hubbell, a Justice Department official in the Clinton administration who left under a cloud over billing irregularities at his law firm. Mr. Hubbell would later plead guilty to fraud charges and spend time in prison.
Mr. Rapoport was called to testify before a grand jury about $18,000 in payments his company had made to Mr. Hubbell. While critics of Mr. Clinton characterized such payments from Mr. Rapoport and others as hush money, Mr. Rapoport said it had been for legal and consulting services. The grand jury took no action against him.
Besides his granddaughter Abby, Mr. Rapoport is survived by his wife; his son, Ronald; and another granddaughter, Emily Rapoport.
Hundreds of people showed up for a memorial service on April 11 in Waco: business executives, politicians and educators. And Michael Aguilar, who wore his Cub Scout uniform.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Rubio Is Latest Possible Running Mate to Join Romney on the Campaign Trail

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
CHESTER TOWNSHIP, Pa. -- Senator Marco Rubio of Florida looked on respectfully Monday afternoon as Mitt Romney addressed a group of reporters in a suburb of Philadelphia. He clasped his hands behind his back, rested them on his hips and folded them in front of him. He nodded almost imperceptibly at the appropriate times and, later, clapped along with the crowd.
As Mr. Rubio campaigned with him on Monday, standing at his side quietly as Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, fielded questions on illegal immigration, he also became the latest member of the up-and-coming Republican establishment to try out as a potential vice-presidential candidate with the party's likely nominee. 
Mr. Rubio, whose appearance in Pennsylvania with Mr. Romney set off a new series of vice-presidential ripples, stayed relentlessly on message: ''I'm not talking about that process anymore,'' Mr. Rubio said when asked if he believed that, as a first-term senator, he was experienced enough to be Mr. Romney's ''No. 2, a heartbeat away.''
Last week, Mr. Rubio rolled out plans for a compromise version of the Dream Act, the Congressional legislation that would offer illegal immigrants brought into the country as children a pathway to citizenship by earning a college degree or serving in the military. Mr. Rubio's compromise would grant a nonimmigration visa to young illegal immigrants who have graduated from high school and have no criminal record. Once the visas are secured, they would be able to work, get an education and decide on their own whether to begin the standard process to become citizens. Mr. Romney has said he would veto much of the Dream Act.
But when asked about Mr. Rubio's proposal, Mr. Romney said that it ''has many features to commend it'' and was ''something we're studying.''
And in part of an effort to win over young voters in the general election, Mr. Romney also was careful to say that, unlike House Republicans, he supports a temporary extension of a low interest rate on federal student loans, which President Obama also favors.
Though Mr. Romney carefully noted that ''the process for selecting a vice-presidential running mate is just beginning,'' Mr. Rubio did seem to be one of a series of potential running mates who have campaigned with Mr. Romney in recent weeks. These men and women -- including Senator Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, Gov. Nikki R. Haley of South Carolina and Senator John Thune of South Dakota -- have helped him stump in early primary states, but their presence has also given Mr. Romney the chance to learn who is perpetually late, who might overshadow him, who relates well to him and who, of course, is a great campaigner.
Gov. Bob McDonnell of Virginia flew on a small chartered plane in South Carolina with Mr. Romney; Ms. Haley barnstormed around her home state with Mr. Romney, as well, clocking many hours of rallies -- and face time.
Senator Rob Portman of Ohio campaigned with Mr. Romney during his state's primary, and hosted a small dinner with members of the news media and several Romney staff members.
Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, meanwhile, introduced Mr. Romney to Culver's for butter burgers and chocolate malts, and exhibited all of the telltale signs of a ''bromance''; the two laughed and riffed off each other so frequently that Mr. Romney joked about having to deny that Mr. Ryan was one of his sons.
Though Mr. Romney and Mr. Rubio did not share notable personal chemistry and or the easy banter of longtime friends, they did spend some time together on Monday. They met at the airport, and rode and chatted on Mr. Romney's bus.
Mr. Rubio said little as he stood alongside Mr. Romney during a brief, six-question news conference during a joint appearance, but Mr. Rubio often took the microphone after Mr. Romney, frequently echoing the candidate's answers.
When he talked about his own life story, as the son of two Cuban immigrants whose parents' hard work allowed him to experience the American dream and become a senator, he seemed to underline Mr. Romney's campaign themes of economic opportunity and American exceptionalism.
''I had the privilege and the honor of being born in the single greatest society in all of human history,'' Mr. Rubio said. ''This is who we've been, this is who we are, and this is what we must remain, but we will not if Barack Obama is president another four years.''
If Mr. Romney was looking ahead to November, he also had a few moments to reminisce. When a French television reporter asked Mr. Romney for a favorite recollection of France, where he lived as a Mormon missionary, Mr. Romney said his ''best memories'' were with his wife, Ann.
He recollected ''the last vacation we had there, walking around the city of Paris, and walking not just in the Champs-Elysees, but also over to the Jardin of Luxembourg and around the city,'' and called it ''one of the most magnificent cities in the world.''
''I look forward to occasional vacations again in such a beautiful place,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Call For Growth Rises To Counter German-Led Cuts

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH; Jack Ewing contributed reporting from Frankfurt, and Liz Alderman from Paris.

 BODY:
BERLIN -- With political allies weakened or ousted, Chancellor Angela Merkel's seat at the head of the European table has become much less comfortable, as a reckoning with Germany's insistence on lock-step austerity appears to have begun.
''The formula is not working, and everyone is now talking about whether austerity is the only solution,'' said Jordi Vaquer i Fanes, a political scientist and director of the Barcelona Center for International Affairs in Spain. ''Does this mean that Merkel has lost completely? No. But it does mean that the very nature of the debate about the euro-zone crisis is changing.''
A German-inspired austerity regimen agreed to just last month as the long-term solution to Europe's sovereign debt crisis has come under increasing strain from the growing pressures of slowing economies, gyrating financial markets and a series of electoral setbacks.
Spain officially slipped back into recession for the second time in three years on Monday, after following the German remedy of deep retrenchment in public outlays, joining Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands and the Czech Republic. In the Netherlands, Prime Minister Mark Rutte handed his resignation to Queen Beatrix on Monday after his government failed to pass new austerity measures over the weekend. 
The political upheaval drove stock markets on the Continent sharply lower, with Germany's DAX index finishing the day down 3.4 percent. The sell-off in Europe dragged American indexes down around 1 percent. A survey of European purchasing managers showed an unexpected plunge in confidence this month.
The Netherlands, a staunch supporter of the German position, became the latest European country forced into early elections by the European crisis, just one day after the first round of presidential voting in France raised the possibility that the incumbent, Nicolas Sarkozy, would be unseated by his Socialist challenger, Francois Hollande, in a runoff election.
From trading floors to polling stations to the streets of cities across Europe, the message appears increasingly to be that countries cannot cut their way to fiscal health. They need growth, too. In recent months, powerful voices have joined the chorus, including those of the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, and Italy's prime minister, Mario Monti. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner has called repeatedly for Europe to defer budget cutting in favor of some form of stimulus spending.
Pressured by the presidential campaign, even Mr. Sarkozy, once Ms. Merkel's most prominent ally, has begun to talk of the need for growth.
Despite the rising criticism, Berlin did not seem ready to concede defeat for its austerity plan.
''We certainly still have many difficult reforms, measures and times ahead of us,'' said Martin Kotthaus, spokesman for the Finance Ministry. ''But the path appears to be correct. At least that is what the development of the last weeks and months proves, and also -- as far as I can tell -- the surveys of the populations of the European Union.''
It was only in March that leaders from 25 of the 27 European Union countries gathered to sign the fiscal compact championed by Ms. Merkel. Her plan, combined with $1.3 trillion in cheap loans injected into the banking system by the European Central Bank in December and March, raised hopes that the worst of the crisis had passed.
But those hopes have been dashed as growth has faltered and interest rates on the debt of struggling countries like Spain and Italy have shot up to dangerous levels again.
''If significant numbers of the coalition wobble or fall, then Berlin has a problem,'' said Constanze Stelzenmuller, a senior fellow in Berlin with the German Marshall Fund of the United States.
However, while there is a growing consensus on the need for new growth policies, it is far from obvious what those policies should be, particularly for the heavily indebted countries already having trouble selling government debt.
''You have this dilemma because you have to borrow more money to finance growth measures, but that is also likely to stir up the financial markets,'' said Tanja Borzel, a professor of European Union politics at the Free University in Berlin. ''Then the money you need will be more expensive to borrow.''
The European Central Bank cannot be counted on to deliver major monetary stimulus in the manner of the United States Federal Reserve because the bank is required by treaty to combat inflation above all else. One option is to allow debtor countries more time to bring their deficits under control, but that is seen more as damage control than as a way to foster growth.
Another possibility, which Germany will be under renewed pressure to accept, is some form of common European debt, generally referred to as Eurobonds, which any member of the currency zone could tap. It is a step that Ms. Merkel's conservative bloc has opposed forcefully, but with more than 17 million people in the euro zone out of work and the unemployment rate at 10.8 percent, the need for urgent steps is growing.
Marie Diron, an economic adviser to the consulting firm Ernst & Young, said Germany could slow down its own drive to balance its budget and do more to encourage domestic consumption. Other European states would benefit if Germany bought more of their goods.
''Austerity has to fit into a wider policy context,'' Ms. Diron said.
Taking advantage of growing voter outrage, fringe parties like the Greek ultranationalist group Golden Dawn and France's far-right National Front, which won nearly one in five votes Sunday, are gaining strength, evoking comparisons to the Weimar era, which ushered the Nazi Party into power. That has only added urgency to the push for programs that would create jobs.
''You see an incredible public uproar against the strict austerity measures,'' Ms. Borzel said. ''It's mostly the populist parties that now become ever more critical of the austerity policies.''
Even in Germany, where unemployment is low and the crisis seems a faraway phenomenon, the political landscape has grown unpredictable. The computer hackers of the Pirate Party, which supports Internet freedom, have emerged from relative obscurity to challenge the Green Party as the third most powerful faction in opinion polls.
Ms. Merkel's coalition partners, the pro-business Free Democrats, have been the most prominent victims of the political instability. In trying to stave off its total collapse, the party has become a less and less reliable partner, especially when European rescue packages are up for votes in the German Parliament.
''In a nutshell, you need growth and employment or else debt reduction doesn't work. We're seeing that right now in Spain,'' Sigmar Gabriel, the head of Germany's opposition Social Democrats, said on German public radio, adding that Ms. Merkel's policies had failed in southern Europe. ''The success of Hollande was in sending a signal beyond France that the politics of Merkel and Sarkozy are not without alternatives.''
Over the years of the euro crisis, Ms. Merkel has moved on the problems at a deliberate pace, a tactic of brinkmanship meant to achieve debt reduction across the euro zone while limiting German exposure to other countries' liabilities and, therefore, minimizing political damage at home. So far it has largely worked in Germany, and her support in Europe is broader than it appears, with smaller countries like the Baltics, Finland and Austria -- and even the larger and increasing supportive Poland -- content to stand quietly behind her.
Ms. Merkel has proved herself a masterful tactician time and again. She was adept at working with the Social Democrats as her partner in the previous German government, and Mr. Hollande might be even more amenable than Mr. Sarkozy to ceding French sovereignty in economic policy in exchange for help on growth, Mr. Vaquer from the Barcelona Center for International Affairs said.
''She will have to backtrack on austerity anyway,'' Mr. Vaquer said. ''Germany can now extract a much more unified Europe in terms of economic governance than it ever could have before.''

HEADLINE: American Car Parts Makers Gain In Russia

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Critics of the Obama administration's thawed diplomatic policy toward Russia, known as the ''reset,'' say it has brought few concrete results. But this week, a visiting American trade delegation is promoting an economic benefit -- a doubling of exports of American car parts to Russia over the past year.
The increase in sales is striking even compared with an overall rise in American exports to Russia, which the Commerce Department says were up about 40 percent last year, partly owing to trade rebounding after the recession. 
Aerospace and software companies are also doing well. Proponents of the reset point to the recent multibillion-dollar joint venture between Exxon Mobil, America's largest oil company, and Russia's state oil company, Rosneft, as another economic payoff of the policy.
Most American auto parts exported to Russia are put in new cars at assembly plants set up earlier by Ford, General Motors or European or Japanese competitors. But aftermarket sales are also rising. Reflecting the significant accomplishment of makers of gaskets, fenders and headlights, a deputy under secretary of commerce for international trade, Michelle O'Neill, led the delegation of 13 car parts companies to the Russian capital and two manufacturing regions.
''Russians love American cars,'' Ms. O'Neill said. ''We think there is extraordinary opportunity for growth.''
Russia's accession to the World Trade Organization, expected this summer with American support, will require that Russia phase out local content rules for automotive assembly plants, further expanding the potential market.
However, Congress must first grant Russia permanent normal trade relation status by repealing a cold war-era statute intended to liberalize emigration of religious minorities, the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, before American companies can take full advantage of the new rules.
Economists have noted for years that Russia and the United States have relatively little direct trade compared with the size of their economies -- a legacy of the superpower standoff and politics today.
To improve economic ties as part of the reset that President Obama introduced in 2009, the Commerce Department established a committee on trade with Russia. Members identified car parts as a prospective market and worked to eliminate barriers to United States exports.
''It has been a focused effort by the Obama administration to deepen commercial and economic relations,'' Ms. O'Neill said in an interview in Moscow on Monday. ''This is one of the fruits of that labor.''
The Commerce Department said auto parts sales rose to $125.3 million in 2011 from $63.3 million in 2010.
Matthew Edwards, the department's director of the office for trade with Russia and other former Soviet states, said mundane trade in items like car parts often goes unnoticed. ''Everybody likes to roll out an airliner,'' he said. ''But a lot of trade takes place on a less sexy level.''
The Hoosier Gasket Corporation, of Indianapolis, is one company poised to sell more parts to Russia. As major manufacturers outsource more components while also assembling vehicles overseas, exports rise for parts makers.
''It's a domino effect,'' Oleg Gostomelsky, a vice president at Hoosier, who was on the delegation, said. ''Now, when Ford decides to come to Russia, as it has, it pulls a lot of companies with it.''
Critics of the reset policy, though, say it has deflected attention from more fundamental American interests by playing down human rights abuse and backsliding on democracy in Russia under Vladimir V. Putin, who is set to begin a third presidential term in May.
Last month, after Mr. Obama inadvertently spoke into an open microphone while discussing missile defense policy with Russia's president, Dmitri A. Medvedev, the Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney characterized Russia as ''without question our No. 1 geopolitical foe.''
As it happens, car parts manufacturers are heavily represented in swing states like Ohio and Indiana, one explanation, perhaps, for careful attention to their industry.
The delegation included representatives of Dana Holding of Maumee, Ohio; Bushwacker of Portland, Ore.; and Cyclo Industries of Jupiter, Fla.

HEADLINE: Conservative Groups Spending Heavily in Bid to Win a Senate Majority

BYLINE: By JEREMY W. PETERS

 BODY:
The conservative groups that helped Republicans win the House in 2010 are pouring money this year into an aggressive campaign to capture the Senate, a goal that they consider just as vital as winning the White House.
Already, they have committed at least $17 million to television commercials in more than a dozen states from Florida to Hawaii, in most cases dwarfing what their Democratic opponents have spent. Their plans call for an effort that will exceed $100 million by Election Day, strategists for these groups said, far surpassing their efforts in 2010, a high-water mark for outside money in politics.
In the weeks ahead, they will pour more resources into states like Nebraska and Missouri, which have already seen some of the heaviest spending, in addition to intensifying their campaigns in New Mexico, West Virginia and Wisconsin.
Their immediate objective: use hard-hitting television ads to tether Democratic candidates to the budget deficit, lackluster economic growth and the perception that government has become too intrusive and unmanageable. 
Except for the candidate, and the phone number that flashes on screen at the end, the ads follow a strikingly similar script.
Senator Fill-in-the-Blank supports business-smothering regulations and will raise your taxes. He also added trillions to the deficit by voting for ''Obamacare'' and will cut your Medicare.
In Missouri, Senator Claire McCaskill, a Democrat, has been buffeted with more than $2.2 million in television ads from Crossroads GPS, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and a group called the 60 Plus Association, which bills itself as a right-leaning AARP and uses Pat Boone as its pitch man. ''Call Senator McCaskill,'' Mr. Boone says in one ad. ''Tell her unaccountable bureaucrats should never have the power to deny you the care you deserve.''
Ms. McCaskill and her allies have countered with ads of their own but are being outspent by more than 3 to 1, data from Kantar Media show.
In Nebraska, Bob Kerrey has been mocked as a liberal Manhattan interloper in a trio of TV commercials from Americans for Prosperity. In one, set to music that vaguely recalls Bernard Herrmann's score from ''Psycho,'' a narrator warns, ''Bob Kerry is moving back to Nebraska, and he wants to bring his liberal agenda back to our Nebraska home.'' Stern-faced citizens object. ''Not in my house,'' says one man. ''Not here,'' says another.
Mr. Kerrey, a former Nebraska governor and senator who left office a dozen years ago to run the New School in Manhattan, has responded with nearly half a million dollars in commercials of his own. That is a considerable expense for his fledgling campaign, and almost as much as the amount of cash he had on hand at the end of March.
The conservative groups' strategy makes clear that they -- traditional Republican allies like the Chamber of Commerce along with newer players like the Karl Rove-backed Crossroads GPS and Americans for Prosperity, a Koch brothers-affiliated venture, among others -- intend to be even more aggressive this year than they were in 2010, when they greatly expanded the role of outside money in Congressional elections.
By forcing their opponents to respond with expensive ad campaigns of their own, these conservative groups are achieving at least part of their goal. But their strategy is not without its risks, namely that they are dumping money into advertising long before voters are really paying attention.
The focus on the Senate reflects conservative hopes for a sweep of the White House and both branches of Congress, and frustration with the Senate's role in blocking legislation passed by the Republican-controlled House, especially on the budget and fiscal issues that have come to dominate the debate in Washington.
''You could argue that what happens in the Senate and the House matters more on a day-to-day basis, on key legislative matters, than an administration does,'' said Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity.
The Chamber of Commerce, which, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, spent more than $30 million on Congressional races in 2010, said it will commit ''measurably more'' this year to House and Senate campaigns in what officials called the most significant political effort in its 100-year history.
''We're going to shape the environment now instead of waiting for the environment that comes to us later,'' said Rob Engstrom, national political director for the Chamber of Commerce. For over a year, the group has enlisted strategists to comb through candidates' voting records and public statements, looking for material useful in an ad.
''We're prepared to quickly engage if developments warrant,'' he added.
Crossroads plans to spend about $60 million on Senate races alone and an additional $30 million on House races. That would more than double what it and its sister organization, American Crossroads, spent in 2010. These sums will come atop the nearly $18 million in air time that the National Republican Senatorial Committee has reserved for the fall.
Americans for Prosperity, which has been an important supporter of the Tea Party movement, and others promoting various aspects of the conservative agenda, like Club for Growth, a group that promotes fiscally conservative and free-market principles, have each vowed to spend millions more.
Democrats acknowledge that they are outgunned, but expect the Republicans' financing advantage to dissipate as the general election nears. Money being spent on ads now, Democratic strategists argue, is being wasted on voters who are not paying close attention to their local races. And it will leave less money for Republicans and their allied groups come the fall, they contend.
''Even Karl Rove's money becomes finite at some point,'' said Matt Canter, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, who added that Democratic incumbents had plenty of cash on hand that would go further because candidates, unlike outside groups, get the lowest possible advertising rates. ''We will not be outspent in practice as much as it might appear.''
In addition to lacking the large donors who have provided much of the money for outside conservative groups, Democrats find themselves at a further disadvantage because President Obama's campaign and the Democratic National Committee do not plan to finance the Congressional campaign committees this year.
Democrats are trying to turn their underdog status into a political benefit by using it to raise money and portray their Republican opponents as beholden to their big contributors. Indeed, Ms. McCaskill features the attack ads being run against her in an ad of her own that rails against the ''special interests'' behind the commercials.
''What they're doing to Claire McCaskill is nothing compared to what their special interest agenda will do to you,'' the narrator says, going down a list that includes tax breaks for the wealthy, ''ending Medicare as we know it,'' and trade policies that benefit China over the United States. ''Claire says, 'Make it in Missouri,' '' the announcer adds, pronouncing it the way many locals do: Muh-zhur-UH.

HEADLINE: Social Security's Financial Health Worsens

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Obama administration reported a significant deterioration in the financial outlook for Social Security on Monday, while stating that the financial condition of Medicare was stable but still unsustainable.
The Social Security trust fund will be exhausted in 2033, three years sooner than projected last year, the administration said. And Medicare's hospital insurance trust fund will be depleted in 2024, the same as last year's estimate, it said.
''The projections in this year's report are somewhat more pessimistic than last year's projections,'' Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said in issuing the annual report on the two programs, which together account for more than 35 percent of all federal spending. 
The central message of the new report was the same as in recent years: the two programs are unsustainable without structural changes that have so far eluded Congress and the administration.
Social Security Commissioner Michael J. Astrue, a trustee of the two programs, said Social Security's disability insurance program faced the most immediate threat, with its trust fund expected to run out of money in 2016, two years sooner than predicted last year.
For the disability program, as for Social Security over all, tax receipts would be sufficient to pay about 75 percent of promised benefits after the trust fund was exhausted.
The estimates, a perennial source of political ammunition in the debate over federal spending, debt and taxes, come as Republicans and Democrats are noisily blaming each other for the problems of the popular programs, which provide benefits to more than 55 million people.
The public trustees of the two programs, Charles P. Blahous III and Robert D. Reischauer, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office, summarized the situation in a joint statement.
''The Social Security outlook has worsened significantly relative to last year's report,'' they said. ''By almost any objective measure, the financial health of the Social Security system has entered a concerning decline.''
The projected gap between Social Security income and costs in the long term is the largest recorded since the last major effort to shore up Social Security, in 1983, the public trustees said.
In the past, Congress has occasionally shifted revenue from one trust fund to another to avoid any interruption of benefits. But if the disability trust fund borrowed money from Social Security's old-age trust fund, the loan would have to be repaid, officials said, and the measure would not solve the programs' problems.
One of the trustees, Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human services, said, ''Medicare is in a much stronger position than it was a few years ago, thanks to the Affordable Care Act,'' signed by President Obama in 2010.
Without that law, Ms. Sebelius said, ''the hospital insurance trust fund would expire eight years earlier, in 2016.'' The law squeezed nearly $500 billion out of Medicare over 10 years, trimming payments to providers on the assumption that they would become more productive.
Richard S. Foster, the chief Medicare actuary, said the projections in the report, based on current law, ''are probably poor indicators of the future financial status of Medicare.''
First, Mr. Foster noted, the report assumes that payments to doctors treating Medicare patients will be cut 31 percent on Jan. 1. In the past, Congress has usually overridden such cuts.
In addition, Mr. Foster restated his view that the savings required by the 2010 health care law ''will not be viable in the long range.''
The best available evidence indicates that most hospitals, nursing homes and other providers cannot increase their productivity as much as Congress assumed, he said.
The trustees themselves said that ''future Medicare costs could be substantially larger than shown'' in their report, which assumes ''unprecedented improvements in health care provider productivity.''
The projected date of exhaustion for the Medicare trust fund was the same as estimated last year, and the short-term outlook for Medicare's finances was similar. But, the public trustees said, ''the reported long-term financial outlook has grown worse,'' primarily because the government accepted advice from technical experts suggesting faster growth in Medicare costs.
The report on Social Security said its finances had weakened for several reasons. The cost-of-living adjustment this year, 3.6 percent, was much larger than the increase of seven-tenths of 1 percent predicted last May.
In explaining changes in their Social Security projections, the trustees cited slower growth in average earnings of workers and the persistence of unemployment in the slow recovery from the recession. They lowered their projection of average real earnings in the future, primarily because of a surge in energy prices and ''slower assumed growth in average hours worked per week after the economy has recovered.''
A bipartisan House-Senate committee on deficit reduction collapsed last fall without any agreement on how to revamp Medicare or Social Security, and the same conflicts were evident on Monday in reactions to the trustees' report.
''The administration has failed to lead, and Congressional Democrats have resorted to demagoguery rather than finding long-term solutions to protect Medicare and Social Security,'' said Representative Dave Camp, Republican of Michigan and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee.
Representative Pete Stark of California, the senior Democrat on the panel's health subcommittee, said, ''Today's report continues to show Medicare on a sound financial footing,'' mainly because of the 2010 health care law. Still, Mr. Stark said, Republicans keep trying to ''end Medicare as we know it, not because the program is unsustainable, but because they want government out of the business of guaranteeing health care.''
The report shows that Social Security will, for the first time, pay out more than $1 trillion of benefits in 2017, up from $725 billion last year.

HEADLINE: In Japan, Suffer the Children

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: "She just took the razor and then she started cutting in front of me." That is how the photographer Kosuke Okahara describes the start of his unusual and deeply personal six-year connection with several young Japanese women who regularly harmed themselves through cutting, making thin, repetitive slashes on their wrists, forearms and thighs. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - "She just took the razor and then she started cutting in front of me."
That was how the photographer Kosuke Okaharabegan a six-year connection with several young Japanese women who regularly harmed themselves through cutting, making thin, repetitive slashes on their wrists, forearms and thighs. 
The theme of his photographs, assembled in a compelling new video presentation by the Asia Society, is called Ibasyo, which Mr. Okahara says means inner peace or "a place where one can feel." His poignant pictures are all the more remarkable for their rare penetration of Japan's famously closed-off society and what he calls "our culture of shame."
"The story's not only about cutting, but more like a feeling of how they live," he tells the executive producer of the piece, Shreeya Sinha, now a Web producer at The New York Times. "Sometimes loneliness they face. Sometimes anxiety they face."
Mr. Okahara, 31, says he had heard about cutting as a social phenomenon. But he didn't know why the young women would do it.
 "I could assume, OK, depression, but why depressed?" he said. "What I encountered was a story inside a family. Like violence. Also rape. I knew there was rape in the society and many women shut their mouths because they don't want to talk."
One of the young women, Sayuri, said she had been raped by a relative. "I don't feel like I'm worthy of anything since then," she told Mr. Okahara. 
Statistics on cutting and self-injury are rarely collected or reported in Japan, and the behaviors are almost certainly underreported, experts say. But a survey in 2008 asked nearly 3,000 students this question: "Have you ever injured yourself deliberately with a knife or other sharp material?" The survey, published in the journal Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences, found that 12.1 percent of girls reported at least one experience of self-harming. (For boys it was 7.5 percent.) 
In the United States and Canada, studies of high school students "consistently show a 13- to 24-percent prevalence rate," according to a useful fact sheet from Cornell University's Research Program on Self-Injurious Behavior. A survey in Britain in 2004 found that about 10 percent of young people between 11 and 25 had self-injured.
Also from the Cornell information:
Many individuals who practice it report overwhelming sadness, anxiety, or emotional numbness as common emotional triggers. Self-injury, they report, provides a way to manage intolerable feelings or a way to experience some sense of feeling. It is also used as means of coping with anxiety or other negative feelings and to relieve stress or pressure.
As he photographed the young women in Japan, Mr. Okahara gradually became friends with them. "Part of my life," is how he puts it.
"Sometimes they cut every day, sometimes once a week," he says. "Sometimes when they feel better they don't cut even once in a month."
One of the women, Kaori, called him one night, sounding drunk, saying she had taken a number of the pills she normally used to allay her anxieties and help her sleep. How many pills? 
"About 270," she told him. 
He rushed to her house and called an ambulance, despite her protest that she couldn't afford it. The rescue squad came, and she recovered. 
All six young women went to psychiatrists, Mr. Okahara says, and three of them have gotten better. 
There is a parallel phenomenon among young Japanese men, one that is more widely known and chronicled, called hikikomori, which means "withdrawal." 
"The anxiety, loneliness and stress felt by these women mirrors the unhappiness and dislocation felt by the hikikomori, or social isolates," says Michael Zielenziger, the author of "Shutting Out the Sun," which examines the shutting-off syndrome in Japan. He says he is "not surprised that these girls would find such negative ways to express themselves."
In a story in The Times Magazine, Maggie Jones said that while "female hikikomori exist and may be undercounted, experts estimate that about 80 percent of the hikikomori are male, some as young as 13 or 14 and some who live in their rooms for 15 years or more." 
In his book, Mr. Zielenziger writes about this "cadre of 1 million young adults, the majority of them men, who literally shut themselves away from the sun, closing their blinds, taping shut their windows and refusing to leave the bedroom in their homes for months or years at a time."
Mr. Zielenziger says Japan's rigid and hierarchical society, combined with a bleak economic future, has literally sent kids to their rooms. As Maggie began her piece:
One morning when he was 15, Takeshi shut the door to his bedroom, and for the next four years he did not come out. He didn't go to school. He didn't have a job. He didn't have friends. Month after month, he spent 23 hours a day in a room no bigger than a king-size mattress, where he ate dumplings, rice and other leftovers that his mother had cooked, watched TV game shows and listened to Radiohead and Nirvana. "Anything," he said, "that was dark and sounded desperate."
"There are plenty of 19-year-olds in America who think they're facing a pretty bleak future," Mr. Zielenziger told Rendezvous in a phone interview. "But imagine a 19-year-old in Japan where there's much less freedom to be yourself. You have no power in society. There are lots of reasons to be depressed. To them it makes sense to hide out. To hide out in your own little subculture."
Almost to a person, he says, the hikikomori he met were smart, inventive, sympathetic, imaginative - "the kinds of kids in America who are starting Facebook or Instagram."
"They just want to be different, but their world won't let them," Mr. Zielenziger says, noting that these kids are often bullied or punished at school. "They're called schizo or lazy. Crazy or lazy. But they're not that. They just want to be different."

HEADLINE: In an Unlikely Corner of Asia, Strong Promise of Growth

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Bangladesh's emerging middle class creates demand for new amenities like seaside resorts. 

 BODY:
"Bangladesh is probably one of the last places in Asia people would expect to see a thriving beachside resort with luxury hotels," Bettina Wassener writes in The New York Times. "And yet, Cox's Bazar is exactly that - a place where affluent Bangladeshis go for a weekend of seaside fun." 
About five years ago, only a few luxury hotels were in this small city on the Bay of Bengal, Ms. Bettina writes. "Smaller hotels and guesthouses are proliferating, and property prices have risen sharply," she writes. 
"The transformation of Cox's Bazar from remote backwater to a beach El Dorado encapsulates the changes that have taken place in this country of 160 million people," she writes, and many other developing Asian countries including India, over the last couple of decades.
"A middle class is gradually forming," said Zahid Hossain, principal economist at the Asian Development Bank in Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. The growth in the country mirrors the developments in other emerging economies, he said. "Domestic demand is growing and becoming an important driver of economic activity."
The progress, though, has been uneven. As in other Asian countries, the gap between rich and poor has widened in Bangladesh, giving rise to social tensions and sometimes violent protests. The murder this month of Aminul Islam, a prominent labor rights activist, apparently in retaliation for his advocacy work, put a spotlight on the low wages and poor working conditions that prevail in burgeoning sectors like the garment industry.
In Bangladesh's countryside, home to more than 70 percent of the population, subsistence farming remains the norm, and weather-related disasters regularly wreak havoc in the flat lowlands.

HIGHLIGHT: A collection of links from the reporters and editors of the Dining section. 

 BODY:
The Economist: From a distinguished journal, a loving evocation of the bagelness of Murray Lender, the pioneering bagel man who died last month at the age of 81. His term for the classic hole-in-the-roll was "the Jewish English muffin," of course, and if he won praise as the Barnum of bagelmania, he also introduced innovations that appalled purists, including pre-slicing, freezing and Minute-Maid cross-promotions. Despite a stroke, he played his drums joyously until nearly the end. -- Glenn Collins 
: You have to search a bit, but Maryland still holds onto its legacy as a rye-drinking state. -- Robert Simonson
Cocktail Buzz: How to transform zucchini (with a dab of, yes, silken tofu) into a tempting cocktail companion. -- Jeff Gordinier 
Wine-Searcher: Michel Rolland, the globe-trotting wine consultant, has a new book out, and he's settling some scores. -- Eric Asimov 
CNN: Oh, the shame of being a woman who has to dine alone, and be thought a loser or a lurer. Some of them fake cellphone conversations. Others simply stay home. But hope may beckon from a new Web site for meeting dinner companions. (Via .) -- Patrick Farrell 
Westchester Magazine: The tireless Julia Sexton culls a list of 50 fine places to grab a drink in the county just north of New York City. -- Jeff Gordinier 
: A sous chef at Tertulia reimagines his grandmother's sambhar -- fragrant, spicy vegetable stew from Pune, near Mumbai. -- Julia Moskin
The New York Post: Hire your own chef? Could be no more outlandish an idea than hiring a house cleaner, especially if you spend a lot eating out in New York. One freelance cook charges $350 a week (not including groceries) to make seven meals. -- Patrick Farrell
New York: A seasonal celebration of the "cruciferous contorno" -- the bunchy, bitter-tasting glory of broccoli rabe. And there's a spicy rabe recipe from Mario Carbone and Rich Torrisi of Parm. -- Glenn Collins
Food & Wine: Want a cocktail mixed by a repurposed antique paint-can shaker? Go to Citizen R + D, one of five bars looked at in this survey of high-tech U.S. cocktail dens. -- Robert Simonson
Discover: Eyeless shrimp? Clawless crabs? A very unappetizing report on the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. -- Jeff Gordinier 
The Wall Street Journal: They come often. They stay but don't linger too long. They tip well. They're the regulars, and more New York bars and restaurants are trying to cultivate them. -- Patrick Farrell
: A very good vintage from Costa Rica? Jancis Robinson looks at wines from some unlikely sources. -- Eric Asimov
: For a low-cal, gluten free kind of gal, a visit to a Quebec farm leads to sugar shock: a plateful of food, from beans to eggs, cooked or coated in maple syrup. -- Patrick Farrell

HEADLINE: The Unconscious Impact of 'The Conflict'

BYLINE: MARIE C. BACA


HIGHLIGHT: Do economic and societal pressures influence women's career choices without our registering their impact? 

 BODY:
 
Jess, I too was skeptical of the pressure to embrace the natural parenting movement -- and then my husband and I decided to conceive and I suddenly found myself surrounded by the pregnancy police. Perhaps the stronghold of liberal activism that is the San Francisco Bay Area is a hot spot for this type of thing, but Elisabeth Badinter's claims about a hyper-judgemental brand of modern motherhood did not seem particularly out of line with my own experiences and those of a few local friends who already have children. 
Case in point: one friend of mine dutifully used cloth diapers on her infant until she moved to an apartment without a laundry facility, at which point she switched to disposables. The mothers in her attachment parenting play group were speechless with disapproval when they found out. Finally, one of the mothers told her that the only appropriate alternative was to use no diapers at all and instead hold the baby over a toilet when she believed the infant was ready to eliminate waste. 
AsKJsuggested, when mothers judge each other, they may really be judging themselves. But why has this phenomenon seemed to reach such a fever pitch? "The Conflict" provides insight here, not in the fighting wordsabout the "voluntary servitude" of natural parenting, but in its discussion of the economic factors that bring women in and out of the workforce. 
We tend to talk about poorer mothers as "having to work" and wealthier mothers as "not having to work" (see the hullabaloo between Hilary Rosen and Ann Romney), but the truth is more complicated. In times of economic downturn, Ms. Badinter points out, women are often the first to be laid off and many withdraw from the workforce because child care becomes financially infeasible. To what extent, then, are the "mommy wars" fueled -- or at least, fanned -- by the frustration women feel about their prospects outside of the home at a given point in time?
I've worked primarily from home for the past six years and hope to continue doing so in some capacity after my child is born. While Ms. Badinter's book did not make me question these plans, it did leave me wondering about the extent to which economic and societal pressures might have influenced my decisions about motherhood without consciously registering as such. In a parallel universe where high-quality child care was free and my dream job required me to work outside of the home, would I choose the same path? Would I feel as frustrated by the pregnancy police, and fear the imminent arrival of the parenting police? It's hard to say.

HEADLINE: That Brawl? Elite Club Wants Nothing Said

BYLINE: ANDY NEWMAN and CHRISTOPHER REEVE


HIGHLIGHT: A table-tossing, bench-clearing melee in the Tap Room of the New York Athletic Club led to three arrests and a stern note from the president not to discuss the matter publicly. 

 BODY:
The 144-year-old New York Athletic Club is known for its nurturing role in the history of American amateur sports, the hundreds of Olympic medals its members have won, and its fancy headquarters on Central Park South featuring squash courts, guest rooms, a library and a strict dress code. 
It has no wish, apparently, to be known for an unscheduled fisticuffs session: a knock-down, drag-out, coed brawl that unfolded at the club's Tap Room in the wee hours of April 13 and ended with two people sent to the hospital and three men under arrest. 
"I cannot state forcefully enough how abhorrent this event is to me," the club's president, S. Colin Neill, wrote in a letter to members on April 18. Then he got to the point: 
"Distribution via the various social media of photographs and letters that are detrimental to the club and its reputation will not be tolerated. It is the responsibility of each and every member to protect and embellish the standing of the N.Y.A.C." 
The club's attempt to bury the matter did not succeed. Last Friday, a witness account that had been making the rounds was posted on the blog Wall Street Jackass. "It was the best fight I've ever seen," the anonymous witness wrote. "Young people, old people, girls, members, nonmembers - it was a nondiscriminatory ragematch."
The witness's note says that the initial fight seemed to have commenced over a woman, and escalated into a brawl involving three fighting "wolf packs." Tables were overturned or moved to the room's periphery to create a "lion's pit" for the battle. 
Other highlights, the witness wrote, included "probably 2 broken noses," "glasses thrown," a woman cut badly enough to require stitches and a "fat pudgy kid" who laid out a larger man with a blow to the head and was tackled by a crowd. 
The police, who arrived after much of the dust had settled, confirmed only the arrests of three men: Peter Doran, 28, of Glen Head on the North Shore of Nassau County, charged with misdemeanor assault and accused of punching a 49-year-old man in the face; Matthew O'Grady, 31, of neighboring Glen Cove, charged with misdemeanor assault on a 48-year-old man; and Colin Drowica, 30, also of Glen Head, who was charged with attempted menacing. Mr. Drowica, a police spokeswoman said, grabbed a 58-year-old security guard's arm and "made some kind of aggressive motion with his fist to the victim, threatening physical injury." 
There is a Colin Drowica listed onLinkedIn as a director at Knight Capital Group, and a brokerage database shows a Colin Drowica at Knight Capital who during a period of unemployment was based in Glen Head. 
The Fire Department, which runs the Emergency Medical Service, said one man with a lacerated head was taken to New York Downtown Hospital and another man with unspecified injuries was taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center.
Last Friday at the club, which costs $8,500 to join and more than $3,000 a year for a membership, James O'Brien, the director of communications, declined to confirm what the witness described as the "epicness" of the brawl, or much of anything else.
"We are not making any comment about anything," Mr. O'Brien said when asked about the brawl and the response letter. He then affirmed the club's policy of silence on internal matters - a policy reinforced by Mr. Neill in his letter to the membership. 
"The club's constitution does not permit publicizing internal matters of the club, or otherwise undermining the private nature of the club," he wrote. Those who breach the club's norms "will be subject to disciplinary action." 
A call to the club on Tuesday inquiring whether an episode involving the summoning of New York's Police and Fire Departments was really an "internal matter" was not returned.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Chairman Previews General Election Campaign

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Reince R. Priebus, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, talks about working with Mitt Romney's campaign, the states he's most focused on and the biggest obstacle to Mr. Romney's election. 

 BODY:
SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. -- In the coming days, the Republican National Committee will merge its operation with Mitt Romney's presidential campaign in an effort to form a more formidable political organization to wage battle with President Obama in the fall. 
That process will probably begin after Tuesday's Republican primaries -- in New York, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Delaware -- when expected victories by Mr. Romney finally close the door on the intraparty competition. The campaign and the party have been quietly talking for weeks, but a formal arrangement is not far away.
But how would it work, practically speaking? The Caucus discussed that issue with Reince R. Priebus, the Republican National Committee's chairman, during the committee's annual spring meeting in the suburbs outside of Phoenix. Here is an edited and condensed transcript of that conversation. 
Q: 
A: Part of this conversation, I still think is a little bit premature. I know, probably to the outside world, you know, what are you talking about? But for us, still, it's a little bit premature. But I don't want to avoid the question, either. As we move in the direction of formalizing Governor Romney as a nominee, I think it's important that we show respect to Speaker Gingrich and Congressman Paul. I think they understand as well, though, that we need to start getting ourselves into a place where we're not just lightly communicating with Mitt Romney's campaign. We need to start formalizing our relationship with Governor Romney. It's my intention to have a seamless and complete merger between the presumptive nominee and the Republican National Committee. That means political, communications, fund-raising, research and the chairman's office, along with the governor's main operational team, are completely merged. 
Q: 
A. I think we've improved a lot in our rapid response and research through communications and getting facts and figures. Our video messaging program is vastly improved. We're going to have these social victory centers that will plug in every person in American through Facebook platforms. Not just our victory centers and phoning from home, but the tools to communicate on research, rapid response. All of those things that we would normally do through e-mail, we're now unveiling through a new Facebook platform that I think is going to be very unique.
Q: 
A: Anytime you run against an incumbent, I mean, naturally there are advantages to being an incumbent. In the case of Barack Obama, though, he's made it much easier. We can talk about issues that really resonate with the American people no matter what distractions the president wants to put forward. We have at the R.N.C., I think, the blessing of being able to use the facts, no matter where they come from, to show that Barack Obama hasn't met the promises and standards that he set himself for the American people.
Q: 
A: The hurdles are that he's an incumbent and he does nothing except raise money and use the leverage and power of incumbency in a way that no American president has ever used before in raising money. He is addicted to raising money. He is addicted to campaigning. If it was a drug, he'd have to go to Campaigning Anonymous to get cured. George Bush did like half of the fund-raisers that Barack Obama did. So that's the hurdle. But the advantage is that truth of where we sit in the American economy and what this president promised he would do are vastly far apart.
Q: 
A: It's like making baseball predictions early in the season. It's hard to tell. We're all fairly trained on the battleground states. You know what dozen states they are. I could rattle them off and you could rattle them off right with me. My sense, though, is that if the Republican nominee and the party and the movement is effective in making this campaign about a campaign of truth as to what the president promised and where we sit, I think we are going to be playing in states that no one is even talking about. States that you would believe to be safe for the president, but in the end, very, very close. Look at Wisconsin. If you look at most of these maps, it will all tell you it's likely Dem. But I look at it as likely Republican. All recent indicators would tell you, from two Supreme Court races, failed attempt on the state Senate, it will be a failed attempt on Scott Walker. It will be very difficult for them to come back and win Wisconsin. There is not a single state that John McCain won in 2008 that we're not going to win in 2012. Nothing.

HEADLINE: Watson Is Said to Bid $5.9 Billion for Actavis

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Watson Pharmaceuticals is expected to offer 4.5 billion euros for the Swiss drug maker Actavis Group, in a deal that would create one of the world's largest generic drug manufacturers. 

 BODY:
12:03 p.m. | Updated 
LONDON -- Watson Pharmaceuticals is expected to offer 4.5 billion euros ($5.9 billion) for the Swiss drug maker Actavis Group in a deal that would create one of the world's largest generic drug manufacturers, according to people with direct knowledge of the matter.
The deal, which is expected to be announced on Wednesday, would involve an upfront payment of 4.25 billion euros and an additional fee of 250 million euros dependent on Actavis meeting its earnings targets for 2012, said one person, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly. The additional payment is based on Actavis increasing its pretax profit by 13 percent for this year. 
The acquisition would help bolster Watson's international presence. While both companies have operations in the United States, Actavis has a larger share of generic drug manufacturing overseas, particularly in Eastern Europe. Last year, Watson reported a 28 percent increase in revenue, to $4.6 billion.
Watson's acquisition of Actavis would be the second-largest takeover of a European company by an American rival this year, according to the data provider S&P Capital IQ. The largest deal was United Parcel Service's $6.8 billion acquisition of the Dutch shipping company TNT Express, which was announced last month. 
American acquisitions in Europe, including the pending deal for Actavis, would total $39 billion this year, a 39 percent increase over the same period in 2011. 
The deal would be welcome news for Deutsche Bank, which remains Actavis's largest creditor after it financed the $5 billion leveraged buyout of Actavis by the Icelandic billionaire Bjorgolfur Thor Bjorgolfsson in 2007. 
In the aftermath of the financial crisis, Actavis has been bogged down by the high cost of its debt. The situation has put pressure on Deutsche Bank, which in its fourth quarter reported an impairment charge of 407 million euros related to Actavis.
The proposed takeover of Actavis is the latest in a flurry of deal activity in the pharmaceuticals industry. Also this month, SXC Health Solutions agreed to buy Catalyst Health Solutions for $4.4 billion, and GlaxoSmithKline made an unsolicited $2.59 billion offer for Human Genome Sciences. 
About $43 billion worth of transactions in the global health care sector have been announced this year, an 18 percent drop compared with the same period in 2011, according to the data provider Thomson Reuters.
A Watson Pharmaceuticals spokesman declined to comment.

HEADLINE: Obama Opens Two-Day Trip to Try to Recapture Youth Vote

BYLINE: PETER BAKER


HIGHLIGHT: At his first stop at the Chapel Hill campus of the University of North Carolina, Mr. Obama pressed Congress to stop student loan interest rates from rising significantly this summer. 

 BODY:
BOULDER, Colo. - President Obama opened a two-day, three-campus swing on Tuesday designed to recapture the youth vote that helped propel him to the White House four years ago, presenting himself once more as a product of poverty in implicit contrast to his wealthy opponent.
At his first stop at the Chapel Hill campus of the University of North Carolina, Mr. Obama pressed Congress to stop student loan interest rates from rising significantly this summer, recalling in vivid terms the "mountain of debt" that he and his wife accumulated when they were students. While he did not mention Mitt Romney's name, the comparison was hardly lost on his audience.
"I didn't just read about this," Mr. Obama told some 6,000 students and others in the university's arena. "I didn't just get some talking points about this. I didn't just get a policy briefing on this. Michelle and I, we've been in your shoes. Like I said, we didn't come from wealthy families."
Mr. Obama went on to say that he and Mrs. Obama paid more for student loans than the mortgage on their first condominium and only paid off the debt eight years ago. "When we married, we got poor together," he said. "We added up our assets and there were no assets. And we added up our liabilities and there were a lot of liabilities."
His speech came less than a week after he declared at another stop that he "wasn't born with a silver spoon in my mouth." Mr. Obama became a millionaire off the success of best-selling books once he became a nationally known political figure.
The specific issue on Mr. Obama's agenda was the cost of federally subsidized student loans. Interest rates for seven million students are due to double to 6.8 percent on July 1. The president criticized Congressional Republicans for not committing to legislation to stop that from happening. Some Republicans have said they are open to or support such legislation and that the real question was how to pay for the $6 billion cost, a question that Mr. Obama has not answered.
Mr. Romney, now the presumptive Republican nominee, said Monday that "I fully support the effort to extend the low interest rate on student loans" because of "the extraordinarily poor conditions in the job market," conditions he attributes to Mr. Obama.
Other Republicans criticized Mr. Obama for having no plan to pay for the extension of lower student loan rates, pointing to a radio interview by a White House official who said that could be negotiated and "really isn't the issue." Speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One, Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, suggested one possibility would be closing tax loopholes for S chapter corporations.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said Mr. Obama was trying to manufacture an issue and that his campus speeches were intended to distract from economic policies that have made it harder for young people to get jobs.
"I'm sure he'll give a very rousing speech, full of straw men and villains who stand in the way of their dreams," Mr. McConnell said on the Senate floor before the president's first appearance. "I'm sure he'll also express his strong support for things that all of us agree on. But what he won't talk about is the extent to which the decisions he's made are limiting their opportunities in the years ahead."
After his speech in Chapel Hill, Mr. Obama was planning to tape an appearance on the Jimmy Fallon show, then fly here to address students at the University of Colorado in Boulder. On Wednesday, he planned to take his campus tour to the University of Iowa before returning to Washington.

HEADLINE: North Carolina, I Love You. I Really, Really Love You.

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: At Chapel Hill, the president repeatedly stated that he loves North Carolina, and said nothing about Amendment One. 

 BODY:
During his speech at the University of North Carolina today, President Obama mentioned North Carolina 10 times, mostly to say how much he loves it. "Love North Carolina," he said. "I love North Carolina. I do. Every time I come down to this state I just love it that much more."
He finished up by declaring his faith in the University's students. "No matter how tough these times have been, no matter how many obstacles that may stand in our way, I promise you, North Carolina, there are better days ahead. We will emerge stronger than we were before. Because I believe in you. I believe in your future. I believe in the investment you're making right here at North Carolina."
This much is clear: The president loves North Carolina. The state the university.

For all that, minus the references, he could have delivered the speech anywhere. It was noticeably lacking in specifics as to the political situation in the real North Carolina, the one that lies outside the basketball stadium where he spoke - the state he barely won in 2008 and that he may well lose in 2012; where unemployment is in double digits; where the Democratic governor, Bev Perdue, is not even bothering to run for re-election; and where residents will be voting in two weeks on what has to be one of the most depressing ballot initiatives of the year.
The proposal, called Amendment One, would ban not only same-sex marriages, but also civil unions. It's causing a huge commotion in North Carolina.
Mr. Obama never mentioned it.
The president has made some effort to end officially sanctioned discrimination against gay couples, one of the last remaining formal barriers to true equal rights. His administration has stopped defending the Defense of Marriage Act, which prohibits federal recognition of same-sex unions.
Yet he still refuses to come out in support of marriage equality, claiming that his position is "evolving." His silence on Amendment One this afternoon, and on gay marriage throughout his presidency, may keep his campaign managers happy, but hardly reflects the "yes we can" attitude that got him elected.

HEADLINE: Flamboyant Son of Fallen Chinese Leader Makes a Statement

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: Bo Guagua, 24, a graduate student at Harvard, has been at the center of the remarkable downfall of his father, Bo Xilai, a former Politburo member. The son, who was famously said to have driven around Beijing in a red Ferrari, was even mentioned in the official statement about his father's scandalous ouster. Through it all, the younger Mr. Bo has been silent. Until now. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - In the most sensational political drama in decades in China, the fall of the former Politburo member Bo Xilai has captivated the country for months with its cloak-and-dagger intrigue, charges of corruption and murder, and a compelling cast of personalities.
Among the central characters in the tumult is Mr. Bo's son, Bo Guagua, 24, a graduate student at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. He was even mentioned in the official statement describing the reasons for his father's removal from power. 
Over the past few months, although the younger Mr. Bo became a regular focus of social-media attention, he has remained silent. A photographer from Hong Kong even climbed up to a second-floor window to take pictures of an apartment that he allegedly rented in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Rumors also circulated last week that he had dropped out of school.
But now Mr. Bo has spoken. 
In a statement to the Harvard Crimson newspaper, he said, in part: "I am deeply concerned about the events surrounding my family, but I have no comments to make regarding the ongoing investigation. It is impossible to address all of the rumours and allegations about myself, but I will state the facts regarding some of the most pertinent claims."
His entire statement can be found here.
Naturally, social-networking sites and microblogs in China were alive with the news Wednesday morning. To avoid government censors, snarky bloggers sometimes refer to the younger Mr. Bo as "Prince B." 
There has been much speculation how Mr. Bo's family could have afforded the costs of his education - not to mention the travel, living expenses and lavish parties - at an exclusive prep school in Britain, then Oxford, then Harvard.
His reply: "My tuition and living expenses at Harrow School, University of Oxford and Harvard University were funded exclusively by two sources - scholarships earned independently, and my mother's generosity from the savings she earned from her years as a successful lawyer and writer."
He once reportedly arrived - at the wheel of a red Ferrari - at the U.S. ambassador's residence in Beijing for a date with a daughter of Jon M. Huntsman Jr. 
Mr. Bo's reply: "I have never driven a Ferrari. I have also not been to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing since 1998 (when I obtained a previous U.S. Visa), nor have I ever been to the U.S. Ambassador's Residence in China. Even my student Visas were issued by the U.S. Consulate in Chengdu, which is closer to my home of five years."
About his reputation as "an academically indifferent bon vivant," as my colleagues Andrew Jacobs and Dan Levin have described him, Mr. Bo went into some detail about his performance at his various schools:
* My examination records have been solid throughout my schooling years. In the British public examination of GCSEs, which I completed at the age of 16, I achieved 11 'A Stars,' whereas the necessary requirement is no more than 9 and 'A' grades are considered good marks. I also earned straight A's for both AS level and A-level Examinations at the ages of 17 and 18, respectively.
* At the University of Oxford, I studied Politics, Philosophy and Economics. I was a 'tripartite', being enrolled in all three subjects, rather than dropping one in the second year, as is the norm. Upon graduating, I earned a 2:1 degree (Second Class, First Honours) overall and achieved a First in Philosophy.
* During my time at Oxford, it is true that I participated in 'Bops,' a type of common Oxford social event, many of which are themed. These events are a regular feature of social life at Oxford and most students take part in these college-wide activities.
Mr. Bo's statement concludes with his acknowledgment that "the public interest in my life has not diminished."
"However, I wholeheartedly request that members of the press kindly refrain from intruding into the lives of my teachers, friends and classmates."
He signs his statement: "Faithfully, Guagua Bo."

HEADLINE: Kabul Toasts the Queen With a Cool Drink, and the Fizz of Diplomacy

BYLINE: GRAHAM BOWLEY


HIGHLIGHT: On an occasion of celebrating Queen Elizabeth II's birthday at the British Embassy in Kabul, remarks tiptoed around Afghan, British and American interests, not always gracefully. 

 BODY:
Strains of "God Save the Queen" floated over Kabul on Sunday.
They were coming from behind the fortified blast walls of the British Embassy in the diplomatic quarter of Wazir Akbar Khan, where diplomats, top military brass, members of the Afghan Parliament and police chiefs gathered to celebrate the birthday of Queen Elizabeth II.
About 600 people, probably more, stood shoulder to shoulder on the embassy's hockey pitch to sip mango juice and gin and tonics beneath a sweeping red, white and blue canopy, like a huge Union Jack.
Security was high -- Gurkhas and Afghan guards patrolled the rooftops and gates.
After all, exactly a week earlier, on a similarly fragrant blue spring Sunday afternoon, bullets and rocket-propelled grenades had loudly rained down on this district from one of the three squads of insurgents who had climbed into half-finished tower blocks and launched attacks, paralyzing the city for 18 hours and giving a reminder of just how tenuous the peace is here.
The polite chatter, British accents and colorful patriotism were a reminder of the days when Britain was the big fish in this town, more than a century ago now, and the British imperial representatives were the people to be seen with -- rather than the United States diplomats cloistered in the sprawling American Embassy just around the corner.
The Americans had sent one of their deputy ambassadors, the impeccably-dressed Richard G. Olson, who stood tall in the crowd. But Ambassador Ryan Crocker had something else more important on this afternoon - initialing, finally, the long-term strategic partnership agreement, which will shape American commitments to Afghanistan for the next 10 years. Above all, the agreement is supposed to demonstrate that the United States will not simply abandon the country like it did after the Soviets were routed in the 1990s, paving the way for even greater turbulence in this turbulent nation and the rise of the Taliban.
As well as politely toasting the Queen's 86th birthday, the crowd was welcoming the new British ambassador, Sir Richard Stagg, a venerable gray-haired diplomatic veteran recently arrived from India. President Hamid Karzai had sent flowers. The Afghan minister of commerce and industry, Anwar ul-Haq Ahadi, gave a speech - which surprisingly, for an afternoon drinks party, was not without its tensions.
Afghanistan and Britain had had a long relationship, he said - which was "bound to have its up and downs."
That helpfully glossed over the bloody episodes of the Anglo-Afghan wars, and drew nervous titters from the crowd.
(Ironically, Wazir Akbar Khan, the neighborhood in which the ceremony was held, was named for one of Afghanistan's chief independence fighters, who killed more than a few British soldiers in his day.)
The minister moved on to praise British parliamentary democracy, which Afghanistan has proudly adopted. It was, he said, the best in the world.
En masse, the crowd seemed to hold its breath.
Quickly the minister added that of course American presidential democracy was also the best in the world.
Even at a someone else's garden party, he was quick to recognize who pays most of the bills in Kabul. The United States may be leaving, but its billions in aid could prop up the Afghan economy for years to come.

HEADLINE: After Delaware Primary, Gingrich Campaign Will 'Reassess' Race

BYLINE: RICHARD A. OPPEL JR.


HIGHLIGHT: For now, Newt Gingrich places all of his bets on the Delaware primary on Tuesday. 

 BODY:
Could this finally be Newt Gingrich's swan song? After a roller-coaster campaign that saw the former House speaker stage multiple comebacks -- hitting his high moment when he clobbered Mitt Romney in South Carolina three months ago -- Mr. Gingrich now seems to be thinking about dropping out of the race altogether.
His debt-laden campaign has put a lot of marbles on a strong showing Tuesday night in Delaware, one of five states holding a Republican presidential primary on Tuesday. With no polling available, it is hard to gauge his chances of carrying the state.
But if he doesn't, Mr. Gingrich suggested in an interview Monday with NBC News, he would have to "reassess" his campaign, which is candidate-speak for maybe calling it quits.
"I think we need to take a deep look at what we are doing," Mr. Gingrich told NBC News on Monday. "We will be in North Carolina tomorrow night, and we will look and see what the results are."
"This has been a good opportunity for us, we have been here seeing a lot of people," he added, about Delaware. "We have got really positive responses, and I would hope we would do well here - either carry it or come very, very close."
On Tuesday, Jackie Gingrich Cushman, the candidate's daughter, repeated Mr. Gingrich's comments about re-evaluating the campaign.
"He talked about waiting for results and looking to see what happens and then potentially reassess," Ms. Cushman told MSNBC.
Mr. Romney has all but won the Republican nomination, and Delaware and its 17 delegates are hardly the stuff of a campaign turnaround.
But that hasn't deterred Mr. Gingrich from campaigning feverishly: According to his official schedules, he has made at least nine campaign stops in Delaware over the past two weeks.
And he has been collecting - and publicizing - endorsements as if it were the early days of the Iowa campaign, promoting support from county Republican leaders in Delaware at a point when even big-name national Republican leaders' throwing their support to Mr. Romney barely makes the news anymore.

HEADLINE: Romney Delivers Big Primary Wins, Assails Obama in Speech

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney has won primaries in Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Delaware and Connecticut, according to The Associated Press, giving the presumed nominee early victories in an evening expected to cement his status as the party's new standard-bearer. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney declared that he had accomplished a sweep of five states Tuesday night and laid claim to the Republican presidential nomination after what he said were 43 primaries and caucuses and "many long nights."
"I can say with confidence and gratitude that you have given me a great honor and solemn responsibility, and together, we are going to win on Nov. 6," he said.
Speaking to those frustrated by the economy, he said: "Hold on a little longer, a better America begins tonight."
Making it clear that he intends to campaign vigorously against President Obama, Mr. Romney said: "Tonight is the start of a new campaign" and then added: "Tonight is the beginning of the end of the disappointment of the Obama years."
Mr. Romney won primaries in Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Connecticut, according to The Associated Press, giving the presumed nominee early victories in an evening expected to cement his status as the party's new standard-bearer. 
The Associated Press also declared Mr. Romney the victor in Delaware, a state that Newt Gingrich had said would be a critical state for him as looks to continue his battle with Mr. Romney all the way to the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla., this summer.
The results in New York had not yet been called by news organizations. 
Mr. Romney sought to reintroduce himself Tuesday night as the nation begins to tune into the general election competition. He described his father as growing up poor and failing to graduate from college before becoming a car executive and governor.
"You might have heard that I was successful in business. And that rumor is true," he said. "You might not have heard that our business helped start other businesses, like Staples and Sports Authority and a new steel mill and a learning center called Bright Horizons."
He added: "After 25 years, I know how to lead us out of this stagnant Obama economy and into a job-creating recovery."
But he spent much of his time criticizing the president's economic policies and put forth what he said was a different vision for America - an America that is "fundamentally fair," he said.
"In the America I see, character and choices matter. And education, hard work and living within our means are valued and rewarded," he said. "And poverty will be defeated, not with a government check, but with respect and achievement that is taught by parents, learned in school and practiced in the workplace."
"Because he has failed, he will run a campaign of diversions, distractions, and distortions," Mr. Romney said. "That kind of campaign may have worked at another place and in a different time. But not here and not now. It's still about the economy -- and we're not stupid."
In his speech, Mr. Romney responded directly to Mr. Obama's attempts to talk about the unfairness of the economic situation in the country for the poor and the middle class. Mr. Romney said he, too, is focused on unfairness, but he defined it differently.
"We will stop the unfairness of politicians giving taxpayer money to their friends' businesses; we will stop the unfairness of requiring union workers to contribute to politicians not of their choosing," he said. 
He went on: "We will stop the unfairness of government workers getting better pay and benefits than the taxpayers they serve; and we will stop the unfairness of one generation passing larger and larger debts onto the next."
Mr. Romney also sought to provide a more positive vision after a campaign that has been dominated by negative campaigning, much of it by his own advisers and allies.
Several big-name Republicans have called in recent days for Mr. Romney to spend more time describing how he would fix America and less time describing a dreary, depressing future if Mr. Obama is re-elected.
In the speech Tuesday night, Mr. Romney appeared ready to take some of that advice.
"I have a very different vision for America, and of our future," he said. "It is an America driven by freedom, where free people, pursuing happiness in their own unique ways, create free enterprises that employ more and more Americans. Because there are so many enterprises that are succeeding, the competition for hard-working, educated and skilled employees is intense, and so wages and salaries rise."
He also said that he sees "an America with a growing middle class, with rising standards of living. I see children even more successful than their parents -- some successful even beyond their wildest dreams - and others congratulating them for their achievement, not attacking them for it."
Mr. Romney started speaking even as Mr. Gingrich was holding his own news conference. Cable networks, including CNN and C-SPAN, which had been broadcasting Mr. Gingrich, quickly broke away to hear what Mr. Romney had to say.
Before the networks broke away, Mr. Gingrich had told reporters that "this is the most important election of our lifetime" and had pledged to continue his campaign, saying that "we are determined to fight all the way to Tampa."
Still, Mr. Gingrich had said on Monday that if he didn't win in Delaware, he would have to "reassess" whether he would continue to go forward.
In an interview on CNN after Mr. Romney's speech, Rick Santorum repeatedly refused to say he was endorsing the presumed nominee, saying only that "it's very clear that he's going to be the Republican nominee."
Under questioning from Piers Morgan, the CNN host, Mr. Santorum said that "yeah, absolutely, he's the person that is going to go up against Barack Obama." And he praised Mr. Romney's remarks as "a good speech," adding "it set the right tone."
But he said he had not yet decided to endorse him. He said he was hoping to talk with Mr. Romney in the next two weeks and would consider what to do after that. 
"We've been trying to decompress a little bit," Mr. Santorum said.
He also denied that he would be trying to get Mr. Romney to help him retire campaign debt or to ask for a position in the administration.
"That's not what this is about," Mr. Santorum said. "This is about winning the election, making sure we have the right person."

HEADLINE: Playing the Mormon Card

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney should start talking more openly about his Mormonism - before others define it for him. 

 BODY:
During the long Republican primary season, the highest-profile attack on Mitt Romney's Mormon faith came in October during the Values Voters Summit in Washington, when the pastor who introduced Rick Perry to the assembly, Robert Jeffress of Dallas's First Baptist Church, told reporters that "born-again followers of Christ should always prefer a competent Christian" for the presidency and dismissed Mormonism as a pseudo-Christian "cult."
The polls suggested that Jeffress spoke for at least some Republican primary voters. The fallout from his comments, though, turned out to be a boon for Romney. Their bald sectarianism gave the front-runner a chance to cry "bigotry"; they prompted a chorus of denunciations from prominent conservatives; and they forced Perry's campaign on the defensive when it was fumbling already. The way the controversy played out suggested that while Romney's Latter Day Saint affiliation might be an electoral liability, any direct attempt to raise the issue was likely to backfire on his political opponents.
Hence the dilemma for the Obama White House. The president is entering a general election campaign in which his best chance of victory is to brand the Republican nominee as dangerously outside the mainstream, and in a sense Romney's Mormon faith offers an ideal path to doing just that. It isn't only evangelicals who regard the L.D.S. Church with a significant measure of distrust: In Gallup polling, 19 percent of Independents (and 27 percent of Democrats) state that they would prefer not to elect a Mormon to the White House. These numbers have been consistent for decades. The polling company notes that "Americans' reluctance to support a Mormon for president has held close to the 20% level since Gallup first measured this in 1967, and long after historical biases against voting for blacks, Catholics, Jews and women have dwindled." (Less than 10 percent of Americans express doubts about voting for a member of each of those groups.)
But it will be difficult for the White House to exploit these suspicions directly. If it seems like prominent Democrats are playing the religion card, then the Romney camp will have a chance to re-run the Jeffress controversy and paint its opponents as bigots. There's also the awkward matter of President Obama's own religious background: The White House probably would rather not do anything that might revive the 2008 debate over the Reverend Jeremiah Wright.
This explains why the White House was so quick to distance itself from Brian Schweitzer, the governor of Montana, when he raised the fact that Romney's great-grandfather practiced polygamy. And it explains why the dog whistles that some conservatives have detected coming from the White House - an Obama spokesman contrasting Romney's "faith" with the president's "Christianity," the repeated references to Romney's "weirdness" from unnamed administration officials - have been pitched too faintly to be heard by most voters.
For Romney's religion to become a significant issue in the general election, the White House probably needs the media to play the Mormon card for them. Not through overt attacks on Mormon theology and practice, which would be out of bounds for most mainstream outlets. Rather, the Obama campaign's best-case scenario involves a wave of theoretically evenhanded coverage come August and September - newsmagazine cover stories on Mormon theology, 60 Minutes specials on L.D.S. history, pieces about Romney's own family tree - that end up reminding undecided voters of the things that they find strange and alien about the Republican nominee's faith.
The media would have good reason to pursue at least some coverage along these lines. If there's ever a year when the Mormon story is worth telling, it's a year when a Mormon is on the presidential ballot. And there's no way to tell the Mormon story comprehensively without bringing up issues (polygamy, race, the Book of Mormon's alternative pre-history of the Americas) that highlight the distance between the Latter Day Saints and other forms of American Christianity.
For Mitt Romney himself, this is the strongest case for not just playing defense on the faith question. The Obama White House may not make Mormonism an issue directly, but that doesn't mean that the incumbent won't benefit from the coverage that Romney's religion will inevitably receive. And it's possible that Romney would stand to gain if he spoke more directly and in more detail about a worldview that's clearly at the heart of his identity, and that provides one of the most authentic and deeply-felt influences on his often inauthentic-seeming personality. In one form or another, there will be plenty of attempts to define Romney's religion for him, and he might be better off doing his own defining first.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart Vows to Fix Its Controls

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN; Randal C. Archibold and Charlie Savage contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Allegations of widespread bribery at Wal-Mart's Mexican subsidiary continued to reverberate on Tuesday, with the company beginning a campaign to limit the damage as its shares declined further.
In a statement, Wal-Mart said it had beefed up its internal controls to make sure it was complying with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which prohibits American companies from bribing foreign officials to secure business. In a newly created position, a top-level compliance official will be responsible for ensuring that the company abides by the law and will oversee five regional compliance directors based in international markets.
In Mexico, the retailer said it had bolstered its training, auditing and internal controls to ensure better compliance with laws against bribery. 
''We are taking a deep look at our policies and procedures in every country in which we operate,'' said David Tovar, a Wal-Mart spokesman.
The New York Times disclosed on Sunday that Wal-Mart's own investigators had found evidence that Wal-Mart de Mexico had paid millions of dollars in bribes to help advance its expansion in a crucial market. When executives at Wal-Mart's Arkansas headquarters were told of the findings, they shut down the investigation, The Times found.
But on Tuesday, Mr. Tovar shot back, ''We believe it's also important to keep a few things in context: The allegations in the New York Times story about the decisions made in Bentonville are more than six years old.'' In addition, he noted that Wal-Mart began its own investigation six months ago and was cooperating with law enforcement authorities.
Shares of Wal-Mart, the world's largest retailer, fell an additional 3 percent on Tuesday, after a 5 percent decline on Monday, closing at $57.77. Shares of Wal-Mart de Mexico, which trades separately, fell 4 percent Tuesday, after a 12 percent decline on Monday.
In a related matter on Tuesday, one of the executives identified in the Times article as a driving force behind the bribery in Mexico, Eduardo Castro-Wright, announced that he had resigned from the board of MetLife, on which he had served since 2008. Mr. Castro-Wright was promoted to vice chairman of Wal-Mart in 2008 and is scheduled to retire this summer.
''Over the past weekend, I notified you of recent events that will require my immediate and personal attention,'' he said in his letter of resignation, adding later, ''I now must focus my energy in spending personal time with my family and in protecting my good name and business reputation.''
MetLife officials declined to comment further on the resignation.
In late 2011 the Justice Department opened a Foreign Corrupt Practices Act investigation into Wal-Mart -- apparently after the corporation had learned of The Times's reporting and disclosed the problems to the government. Wal-Mart said at the time that it was conducting an internal inquiry, a person with knowledge of the matter confirmed.
While the inquiry continues, it is not clear to what extent the case is being actively investigated by federal agents. In cases in which the evidence is overseas and corporations have a strong legal incentive to cooperate with the government to avoid indictment, the work of assembling the facts is often performed largely by counsel retained by the corporation.
In a statement over the weekend, Wal-Mart said that it had continued to meet with federal officials to ''report on the progress'' of its internal inquiry.
The Times article prompted calls for outside investigations in both the United States and Mexico, as well as angry protests from union leaders and activist groups that have long been critical of the retailer's practices.
On Monday, two Democratic representatives, Elijah E. Cummings, of Maryland, and Henry A. Waxman, of California, said they had requested a meeting with Wal-Mart officials and others who might be familiar with the bribery allegations. But Representative Darrell Issa, the Republican chairman of the House oversight committee, appeared to shoot down the idea of Congressional hearings.
''In the case of Wal-Mart, they will be punished under existing laws,'' he said Tuesday in an interview on Bloomberg Television. ''As we review Wal-Mart, it has to be to look at government's role, not simply hauling people in because it makes good headlines.''
A similar dynamic was playing out in Mexico, as candidates for the presidency called for an investigation, while the government said it was a matter better left to state and local authorities.
A spokesman for Enrique Pena Nieto, the front-runner in the Mexican presidential race, set to vote July 1, said the candidate was in favor of a government investigation of the allegations against Wal-Mart, echoing lawmakers from his party.
Another major party candidate, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who has often criticized Wal-Mart's practices, said Sunday that the case showed the government was ''rotten.''
But late Monday night, the Mexican Economy Ministry issued a statement saying that the Wal-Mart allegations referred to permits and licenses obtained at the municipal and state level, outside federal jurisdiction, and did not indicate involvement of federal officials.
''The federal government does not have province in the matters which the investigation alludes to,'' the statement said.
Government officials have generally lavished praise on Wal-Mart, now Mexico's largest private employer and retailer with more than 2,000 stores and restaurants. Just a few weeks ago President Felipe Calderon, after meeting with its chief executive, celebrated its clean energy goals in its stores and its contributions to the economy, including a promised 23,000 new jobs, although labor groups have complained about its wages and the placement of a subsidiary store near archaeological ruins.
Mr. Calderon's office had no comment.

HEADLINE: New-Home Sales Fell in March, Following a Surge

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Sales of new homes fell sharply in March as the housing market remained under pressure, but the monthly decline appears in part to reflect an upsurge in home buying in February. 
The Commerce Department said Tuesday that new-home sales dropped 7.1 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 328,000. February's figures on new-home sales, however, were revised sharply upward to show a 7.3 percent gain, instead of the 1.6 percent decline that was initially reported. This suggests that warm winter weather might have pulled some sales into February that normally would have occurred in March.
As a result, new-home sales were 7.5 percent higher in March than they were a year earlier.
The median sales price of a new home was $234,500 in March, down 1 percent from the February price, the Commerce Department reported. That decline is consistent with the trend shown in the Standard & Poor's/Case-Shiller home price index, also released Tuesday, which showed that prices dropped in February from January in 16 of the 20 cities it tracks. That is the sixth consecutive decline.
Sales of new homes stand at just about half the approximately 700,000-a-year pace that analysts consider evidence of a healthy market.
The supply of unsold new homes fell to just 144,000 in March -- the fewest on records dating to 1963. The supply has been falling over the last two years as builders have cut back on construction.
Michael Gapen, an economist at Barclays Research, said the low inventory level should prompt a moderate pickup in housing construction and provide some support to the economy.
And the pace of decline in the S.& P./Case-Shiller home-price index has slowed. Some economists said that suggested prices were stabilizing. The index fell 3.5 percent over the 12 months that ended in February. That is the smallest annual drop in a year.
The Case-Shiller index showed that prices rose in Phoenix, San Diego and Miami only. They were unchanged in Dallas.
Sales of previously owned homes, meanwhile, rose in January and February, making this winter the best for sales in five years. Such purchases dropped back in March, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 4.48 million, the National Association of Realtors reported last week.
Builders are laying plans to construct more homes in 2012 than at any other point in the last 3.5 years. More jobs and a better outlook among buyers could also make 2012 the first year since 2008 that construction added to the American economy.
Separately, Americans' confidence in the economy remained resilient this month despite continuing job cuts and declining home values.
The Conference Board, a private research group, said Tuesday that its Consumer Confidence Index was at 69.2, down slightly from a revised 69.5 in March. Economists were expecting a reading of 70, according to a FactSet poll of analysts. The current level is below February's 71.6, which was the highest level it had been in about a year.
Consumer confidence is widely watched because consumer spending accounts for 70 percent of economic activity. The current level is significantly below the 90 reading that indicates a healthy economy. But it is well above its record low of 25.3 in February 2009.

HEADLINE: United Technologies' Profit Rises 19%, Topping Expectations

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
HARTFORD (AP) -- United Technologies, the big diversified manufacturer, reported Tuesday that its earnings rose more than 19 percent in the first quarter, though it acknowledged some slowing from weak economic growth in the United States, China and Europe. 
The company posted net income from continuing operations of $1.2 billion, or $1.31 a share, if the businesses that it put up for sale are factored out. That compares with earnings for those same operations last year of $1.05 billion, or $1.06 a share. The results beat Wall Street's expectations for earnings of $1.21 a share.
United Technologies, the parent company of the jet engine maker Pratt & Whitney, the Otis elevator business and Carrier heating and cooling systems, said its revenue was $12.42 billion in the quarter from January to March, down 2 percent from the comparable period last year.
It was the first drop in revenue since early 2010. The company said the costs of a major restructuring now under way would cost more because of what its chief financial officer, Gregory J. Hayes, said would be a ''tough year.''
The company last month announced the sale of numerous businesses, including rocket engine and wind power operations, for $3 billion to help finance its $16.5 billion acquisition of the aerospace supplier Goodrich. It also will take on $8 billion to $10 billion in short- and long-term debt, use $3 billion in cash and $1.5 billion in mandatory convertible issues.
Including the discontinued operations, net income fell to $330 million, compared with $1.01 billion last year. Carrier is credited with helping increase earnings toward the end of the quarter with stronger residential orders in North America, ''obviously, better than we expected,'' Mr. Hayes told investor and analysts in a conference call on Tuesday. However, new equipment orders for Otis elevators fell in China and refrigerated truck sales declined in Europe.
Sales were down slightly at Otis elevator as orders fell 9 percent over the first quarter of 2011, driven by a slow start to the year in China, which was expected. Mr. Hayes said efforts by the government to bring down housing prices had hurt higher-end residential sales that represent about half of Otis's sales in China.
In addition, Otis raised prices in response to cost increases in metals in China, resulting in some order declines, he said.
Citing the ''uneven economic environment,'' United Technologies said it would spend $450 million on restructuring costs to this year, up from previous predictions of $350 million. It expects one-time gains to rise to $600 million, from $500 million.
''It's going to be a tough year this year but I think it will be a solid year and we'll be able to deliver on the commitments,'' Mr. Hayes said.
The company's stock rose 0.1 percent to $79.85 on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Dying Art, Lost Occupation

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
BALTIMORE -- Mike Ricigliano practices a nearly extinct newspaper art: he is a sports cartoonist, poking fun at sports figures with pen, paper and a gag writer's shtick.
How much longer he can earn a living doing what he loves -- he barely gets by now -- rests on finding new work to replace what he has lost. Last year was a brutal recession for him. The Los Angeles Times, The Buffalo News and USA Today Sports Weekly all dropped him for financial reasons.
He still draws a Sunday cartoon for The Baltimore Sun in a raw, busy style influenced by Sergio Aragones, a Mad magazine artist, and Tom Toles, a Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist for The Washington Post. But he recently learned there was no money to keep him sketching the Orioles bird on The Sun's front page in various poses after wins and losses.
''I haven't lost confidence in myself,'' he said in his small, cluttered house. ''I'm just perplexed about which way to use my talents. I haven't lost my voice in this town. It's just not producing income.'' 
Ricigliano's upstairs desk and basement drafting table are overwhelmed by the toys, dolls, pennants, hats, pens and Pez dispensers that have taken residence there. He has no filing system for his large archive and little space to work in, but there has not been much to do lately. He hopes that a Web site designed by one of his sons will attract business -- even if he has to draw without pay for a while.
''I feel like I'm not doing my job if I don't put cartoons out there,'' said Ricigliano, 59, who was wearing an Orioles cap over his gray hair, a hoodie and faded jeans. ''I'm out on a limb with no safety net.''
Drew Litton and Rob Tornoe -- who are among the nation's few remaining regularly published major daily newspaper sports cartoonists -- are struggling less but still feel the pinch of an industry that no longer prizes them. There is more job security in being an editorial cartoonist and dipping into sports, as many do.
''Most editors, especially sports editors, are word people who don't see the sports cartoon as a succinct form of journalism and a different way of covering sports,'' said Tornoe, 34, whose sports cartoons appear in The Philadelphia Inquirer but who also draws editorial cartoons for various outlets.
Litton said: ''It's a part of America that's dying away. I feel we're losing a vital medium.''
It was easier for their predecessors, especially in the golden era from the 1930s to the 1960s.
They blended the skills of a caricaturist and the mind-set of a columnist. They were entertainers and ink-stained jokesters. They were newsroom denizens and deadline artists who churned out five or six cartoons a week that received prominent display. If they possessed power, it was that they drew players, owners and managers in ways that reporters could not with their words.
Sports cartoons were usually more amusing and informative than critical, which reflected the times when the sports section was the fun-and-games department.
Some cartoonists created indelible characters that engaged and comforted readers.
Who can forget the unshaven Brooklyn Bum, created in the 1930s by Willard Mullin of The New York World-Telegram, who connected with fans viscerally long after the Dodgers' Bum days were over? Or Bill Gallo's Basement Bertha, the Mets' washerwoman fan, and his George Steinbrenner-like General von Steingrabber (with spiked helmet and exaggerated German accent) in The Daily News?
''They were kind of visual columnists,'' said Larry Merchant, a former New York Post sports columnist who has an original Mullin cartoon of Casey Stengel hanging in his office in Santa Monica, Calif. ''With the stroke of a pen, they animated the page, maybe in a way that even photographs could not.''
Mullin was the dean of newspaper sports cartoonists, a gifted draftsman and writer whose signature looked like blades of grass. He spent 33 years at The World-Telegram before it closed in 1966; his work also appeared in books; Life, Collier's, and Time magazines; the covers of Mets yearbooks; and in advertisements.
His final cartoon for The World-Telegram (by then merged with The New York Sun) was a vivid illustration of the boxers Dick Tiger and Emile Griffith. He loved to draw boxers because ''they're completely basic; you don't have to know what inning it is,'' he told The New York Times in 1978.
Bob Staake, an artist whose Web site features a gallery of Mullin cartoons, said that Mullin had a ''highly nuanced understanding of anatomy and sports, such as the way he drew a thigh guard on a running back in the '50s.'' He added, ''He captured animation in a still image in an uncommon way.''
One of Mullin's disciples, Charlie McGill, the former sports cartoonist for The Record in northern New Jersey, which is now based in Woodland Park, N.J., recalled a nugget of practical advice from Mullin: ''Keep the Sears Roebuck catalog for research. Say you're drawing a vacuum cleaner; it's tough to make it up out of your head if you're on deadline.''
There were others, of course: Leo O'Mealia, who preceded Gallo at The Daily News, and Bruce Stark, who was also at The News; Karl Hubenthal at The Los Angeles Examiner; John Pierotti of The New York Post and Thomas Paprocki of The New York Sun; Dick Dugan at The Cleveland Plain Dealer and Lou Darvas at The Cleveland Press; Jerry Dowling of The Cincinnati Enquirer; and Murray Olderman of the syndicated Newspaper Enterprise Association.
Long before the recent contraction in the newspaper industry, editors began to view sports cartoonists as vestiges of a bygone era and as budgetary luxuries.
''Sports cartooning is an antiquated form of commentary that hinged on tried-and-true tricks that are considered passe and corny,'' Staake said.
McGill, who still draws The Record's high school athlete of the week, remembered editors telling him to stop drawing his cartoons in 1974 because his work was old-fashioned and circulation was falling.
No full-time sports cartoonist has won the Pulitzer Prize for editorial cartooning, but at least two past winners -- Rube Goldberg (1948) and Paul Szep (1974 and 1977) -- drew sports cartoons early in their careers.
Gallo was the bridge between his craft's heyday and its lean times in New York. When he died last year, the tradition of the star sports cartoonist left with him.
''I wanted to be a sports cartoonist because of him,'' said Ricigliano, who grew up in Brooklyn.
Gallo was a man about town, a major figure for a half-century at The Daily News who also loved and wrote about boxing. In addition to the broad humor of his von Steingrabber cartoons, he moved readers emotionally, no more so than on the day after Thurman Munson died in a plane crash in 1979.
Gallo drew one of his recurring characters, the neighborhood youngster Yuchie, and his pal (both were seen in silhouette) leaving a sandlot crying as Munson looked down from heaven.
''Naw, Yuchie,'' his friend says, ''I just don't feel like playin' ball today.''
In his book ''Drawing a Crowd,'' Gallo wrote: ''The look on Munson's face is almost saying, 'Don't be sad.' But the kids, they're walking the earth, they're in the real world, so they have no heart to play.''
One of Gallo's sons, Bill Jr., said his father ''was a gifted artist, but he didn't dwell as much on the art as much as the message.''
He continued, ''He was very funny, in a soft-spoken way; basically, he was writing six jokes a week.'' He sent in cartoons from his hospital bed until he was too ill to work, Bill Gallo Jr. said.
''He plodded along and did what he loved,'' he said. ''He was a lifer.''
At The Daily News, which still sells copies of Gallo's cartoons, no one is drawing in his place.
''I applied,'' Ricigliano said, ''but they said they just weren't replacing him.''
Litton felt he would be a lifer, too, until The Rocky Mountain News folded in 2009. He had arrived in Denver from El Paso in late 1982, months before John Elway was traded to the Denver Broncos.
It was also early in Dan Reeves's coaching tenure there.
''So I was able to cover Elway and develop those wonderful teeth of his,'' Litton said. ''And I was able to draw Reeves two inches tall. I imagined him as a mouse in the maze that was his offensive plan that he couldn't figure his way out of. He had a paranoid personality, like Nixon.''
Litton, 53, has recovered from The Rocky Mountain News's shutdown by building his Web site, adding The Chicago Tribune and ESPN.com as freelance outlets and moving to the Universal Press Syndicate.
Still, he seems concerned. In 2010, he did a weekly animated cartoon on ESPN.com for its ''Monday Night Football'' coverage but it was not renewed after it failed to garner enough advertising support.
''We're moving to a more visual society,'' Litton said, ''so I'm waiting for editors and publishers to say, 'Wait a second, we're going in the wrong direction by cutting these cartoons.' ''
The view was echoed by Larry Johnson, a former sports cartoonist for The Boston Globe and The National whose work now appears on the Web site of WEEI Radio, where he is a weekend sports-talk host.
''Off-the-field things like the New Orleans Saints' bounties scream out for more people with a visual point of view,'' he said. ''The Internet is really changing the culture.''
Like Ricigliano and Litton, Tornoe said that readers had a strong reaction to his cartoons.
''People will cut out cartoons and put them on a fridge, but not a column,'' he said.
Ricigliano's natural optimism is balanced by thoughts of his career being prematurely sidelined. His talent has not dissipated, and he can still dash off a cartoon about the ups-and-downs of the Orioles or the Ravens, tackle a national subject as he regularly does, or adapt to other local markets, as he did in Buffalo and Los Angeles before the cash ran out.
''My challenge is to reinvent myself,'' he said, but later added, ''I hate to think this is in the past.''

HEADLINE: Pioneers Who Helped Fill More Than a Breadbasket

BYLINE: By DANIEL M. GOLD

 BODY:
In 1910 a dozen young Eastern European Jews moved to the Jordan Valley, then under Ottoman rule, and began to build an agrarian community based on a utopian socialist vision. Men and women were treated equally, everyone shared all they had, and no one had more than anyone else.
That collective, called Degania, was a kibbutz, the first of a communal movement that symbolized aspirations for a Jewish homeland and became, after Israel's statehood, an influential force that eventually was overwhelmed by the capitalistic society that it had helped to foster. 
As ''Inventing Our Life: The Kibbutz Experiment,'' an engrossing documentary by Toby Perl Freilich, shows, the kibbutz movement, now more than 100 years old, has been under constant siege of one form or another. The film meshes interviews with first-, second- and third-generation kibbutzniks -- including those from Sasa, the first kibbutz founded by Americans -- and commentary from Israeli scholars with tours of numerous kibbutzim today and vintage footage from as far back as the 1920s.
While the movement never represented more than 5 percent of Israel's population, it had an outsize impact. The kibbutzim, as the saying goes, ''made the desert bloom.'' They also made huge contributions to an infant nation: their agricultural innovations helped to feed it; their boundaries helped to define its borders; their members made up a large part of its security forces. In both the 1948 and 1967 wars, kibbutzniks played important leadership roles.
It's startling to recall how revolutionary the original vision was, and how rigid its strictest precepts were. Not only was communal dining required, for example, but outside gifts also had to be turned over to the kibbutz. The most controversial decision was to raise children collectively, housing and educating them in separate quarters, keeping them from their parents for all but perhaps an hour a day.
Generations of kibbutzniks have memories and grievances. To the pioneer generation, their sacrifices are forgotten, their socialist principles pushed aside. ''We're not an example anymore,'' one woman rues. Some from the second generation speak glowingly of their communal upbringing, while others say they hated it. ''If you were a little bit outside the norm,'' one man says, ''you were miserable.''
And some from the third generation say that life outside the collective is often tempting. Since a kibbutz's survival depends on the interest of its younger members, compromises are struck; new models are evolving. Not all kibbutzes are agrarian anymore, and members can include professionals who keep most of their income. Today, the film reports, only a quarter of the remaining 270 kibbutzes are purely communal; even Degania has switched to differential salaries.
At 80 minutes, the documentary is at times frustratingly light in its examination, fuzzy on details. The kibbutzim made substantial contributions across a wide spectrum -- from economics to behavioral sciences to education theory to nation building -- each of which bears further study, though few receive more than a cursory nod here. Even so, ''Inventing Our Life'' is a fascinating introduction to a movement scrambling to adjust enough to guarantee a future, without severing all ties to its principled past.

HEADLINE: David W. Levinson

BYLINE: By VIVIAN MARINO

 BODY:
Mr. Levinson, 63, is the chairman and chief of the L & L Holding Company, which is based in New York and owns and operates five million square feet of office space in the Manhattan area. Its portfolio includes 200 Fifth Avenue, once called the International Toy Center, and 425 Park Avenue, which is about to be redeveloped.
He co-founded the company in 2000 and was a vice chairman of CB Richard Ellis until 2005. 
Interview conducted and condensed by
VIVIAN MARINO
Q.What's your take on the Manhattan office market these days?
A. Our outlook is positive. We're seeing a gradual improvement in our economy. We see a supply-constrained market -- in fact, the last 10 years has seen the lowest amount of development in 110 years. We're getting an improvement in the vacancy rates. And in 2011 rents over all in New York have gone up 11 percent.
So business has gotten better. It was a difficult time after Lehman collapsed in 2008.
Q.Lehman was one of your capital partners at the time, at 200 Fifth.
A. I'm very proud to say that every building we had in 2008 we still have today. In fact, during that period of time, a lot of institutions came to us for assistance. Buildings that had been foreclosed on we took over and operated them until they were able to decide what they wanted to do.
Q.Are you working on many projects right now?
A. Some of our existing buildings are going through redevelopments. We are doing a very large retail development down at 195 Broadway, and probably our most important and most exciting new development is 425 Park Avenue.
Q.Let's talk about your plans there.
A. We'll be demolishing about 75 percent of the building. There'll be a podium -- of course the brick skin will come off -- and we'll build a new tower on top of the podium. The current condition of the building -- it's so dated -- is that it's not economically feasible to try to rehabilitate it. It's not a sustainable building in terms of energy efficiency: there's single-pane glass, old mechanical systems.
This is a very special and unique opportunity -- it's a full-block building. There has not been a full-block building built on Park Avenue in 50 years, and there's no other in the foreseeable future.
Q.How do you envision the new building?
A. We'll leave it to the architects, but I would guess probably the first six floors of steel will remain -- that would be the podium -- and then there will be a tower on top of that. We'll start getting Central Park views probably about 300 feet up. There will probably be a variety of floor sizes. We're looking to do it column free, floor-to-ceiling glass and sustainable -- LEED platinum or gold. It's going to be in the range of three-quarters of a billion dollars. So you have to create value.
We just invited 11 of the greatest architects in the world to compete for the design, and then we'll get it down to a short list. We would like to hear back from them some time in early May to see if they're interested. Hopefully we'll have our architect selected by the early fall.
Q.What's the development timetable?
A. It's all ''as of right,'' which means we don't need any special permission or permits. We just have to comply with all of the regulations. We'll begin early spring 2015. All the current leases expire on the same day in April 2015. And we expect we'll complete it by the end of 2017. None of us have ever seen a building demolished on Park Avenue.
Q.Before this project, your last big undertaking was the conversion of the former International Toy Center at 200 Fifth Avenue.
A. 200 Fifth Avenue was a great example of what we're capable of doing. This was a 100-year-old structure of 850,000 square feet, and full capitalization of that building is almost three-quarters of a billion dollars.
We bought it in 2007 and built it through the recession. Not only was there a physical challenge to building this building, there was a financial challenge. And today we're very happy. We have Tiffany & Company headquarters at 350,000 feet and the Grey Group at over 370,000 feet. We're negotiating with one tenant for the last floor in the building. That's 57,000 feet.
Q.You have some history with that building, don't you?
A. My dad had a toy store in Queens and we used to go there and buy electric trains and toys. I never really thought about the building when I was a kid. I was only interested in the toys. I was the official toy tester for my dad. If I liked it, it would get in the store.
Q.You had a successful career as a broker. What drew you to real estate development?
A. The ownership side and development side and construction was always something that I wanted to do. I worked my way through college renovating buildings. I went to Northeastern University and that's how I got through school. And when I graduated college I was the largest landowner in Woodstock, N.Y. I tried to build a ski resort and hotel complex in the mid-'70s, and that sort of collapsed and I essentially lost everything. Then I became a broker.
Q.Is your stake in the Yankees 10 percent, as some reports have said?
A. It's not correct. I don't know where that came from. I don't disclose how much I own. But I wish I owned more.

HEADLINE: In Area Hit by '92 Riot, a Change in Complexion

BYLINE: By JENNIFER MEDINA

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- When racially charged riots blazed here two decades ago, South Central became a national symbol of rage in a poor black neighborhood.
But the population of the area has changed significantly in the time since the acquittal of white police officers in the Rodney King beating inflamed racial tensions across this city.
Today, immigrants from Mexico and Central America live on blocks that generations ago were the only places African-Americans could live. In the former center of black culture in Los Angeles, Spanish is often the only language heard on the streets.
Now, signs for ''You buy, we fry'' fish markets catering to Southern palates have been replaced by Mexican mariscos and Salvadoran pupuserias. In the historic jazz corridor, where music legends once stayed when they were barred from wealthy white neighborhoods in the city, botanicas sell folk and herbal remedies from Latin America. 
In the 1990s, black residents made up roughly half the population in South Central. Today, Latinos account for about two-thirds of the residents in what is now called South Los Angeles -- ''Central'' was officially scrubbed from the neighborhood's name by the City Council in 2003. In the 20-some square miles that make up the area, stretching southwest of downtown from the Santa Monica Freeway to the Century Freeway and as far west as Inglewood, there are 80,000 fewer blacks than there were in 1990.
''This is a huge, pivotal shift, as important as any other population change or migration we've had in the city,'' said Raphael J. Sonenshein, the executive director at the Pat Brown Institute at California State University, Los Angeles, who has studied racial politics in Los Angeles for decades. ''It affects the African-American community's sense of self as it sees a geographic core that really matters to people erode. It changes the whole sense of the neighborhood.''
Even before the civil unrest, as many activists refer to it, there were signs of a changing neighborhood. One oft-cited statistic shows that half of those arrested in the riots were Latino. South Los Angeles still faces the same kind of economic troubles it did 20 years ago: unemployment is high, and those who are able to secure a job typically earn little more than minimum wage. Empty lots dot the streets, a stubborn reminder of the broken promises to rebuild the area after buildings were burned and razed in 1992.
The new buildings that have gone up are mostly thanks either to government or to projects financed by nonprofit or church groups. Crime is down as it is throughout the city, but the dropout rates at high schools remain persistently high. Residents complain of a lack of public transportation and healthy food, though they succeeded in shutting down some of the liquor stores.
For many black residents, particularly those who have been in the area for decades, the changes represent both a loss of history and a sign of upward mobility. Strains lie mostly beneath the surface, typically bubbling up when someone gets angry about construction jobs taken by illegal immigrants who are willing to work for less than minimum wage.
''It's not that I hold it against them to work,'' said Danny Bakewell, a real estate developer and civil rights activist who held protests to shut down construction sites that did not employ blacks. ''But if we can't get jobs and make money in our own neighborhood, where can we get them? This is from where we came; there are other people living in it and they are welcome, but this is our community.''
The changes are evident even at the city's largest black newspaper, The Los Angeles Sentinel, of which Mr. Bakewell is the publisher. For decades, the paper's offices were on Central Avenue, the western border of where blacks were allowed to live during restrictive housing covenants and the street that gave its name to the South Central neighborhood. Then in 1993, it moved four miles west to Crenshaw Boulevard, which Mr. Bakewell now calls the heart of black-owned businesses in Los Angeles.
Bordered by freeways, South Los Angeles is made up of many smaller neighborhoods. On the west side they largely remain predominantly black and middle class; farther east are mostly immigrants, who often share housing with multiple families. Home ownership is common; the small stucco houses with wrought iron fences have served as a starting point for first-time buyers for generations of residents.
Starting in the 1980s, many black families began moving to new developments far away from the urban core, buying up affordable and sprawling homes in then-growing cities like Riverside in the east and Palmdale in the north.
Even now, it is easy to spot signs of the deep history of the black community here butting up against change. Across the street from the Hotel Dunbar, once the best-known hotel for black elites, is a mural created in 1984 featuring black leaders, including Biddy Mason, a former slave who became one of the first black women to own land in Los Angeles. At one end of the mural is a small sign reading ''Don't move, improve,'' a reminder of the campaign some leaders waged decades ago to stem the tide to the suburbs.
A few blocks north is the Second Baptist Church, the host of several N.A.A.C.P. conventions and speeches by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X. Today, the church remains one of the most vibrant black congregations in the city, its early Sunday service broadcast on local radio. But few of the members live in the area anymore; immigrants make up roughly half the population in the neighborhood, blacks are around 10 percent.
The church's preschool program, one of the first in the country created by federal money in the 1960s for low-income families, is almost entirely Latino. The Rev. William S. Epps said that after 25 years as the church's lead minister, he is convinced the church should stay put. Last year, the church commissioned a study with Esperanza, a local community advocacy group, and the University of Southern California to better assess the needs of neighborhood residents and to create programs for them.
''What we need to be doing is serving the area around us without losing our identity or our history,'' Mr. Epps said. ''That means we have to serve two different communities, but that can be done.''
Many community leaders here say that aside from improvements in relations with the Police Department, the most positive change since 1992 is the easing of racial tension. Children whose parents might have looked askance at each other have now grown up together; the influx of immigrants has turned into a large population of second-generation Latinos, many of whom want to bring about the same sorts of improvements that blacks have struggled to bring for decades.
Lilian Marenco, 65, who bought a home near the University of Southern California in the 1970s, was at the time one of just a handful of Salvadorans in the neighborhood. She has since rallied with both black and Latino neighbors to open a new park and a grocery store. That sense of cooperation, though, has ebbed in recent years, she said.
''There's not a great sense of community, people stay in their own worlds until there is some crisis to bring them together,'' she said. ''It happens with every group. Mexicans say things only to other Mexicans, blacks to blacks.''
And what people say in public, she said, often masks the suspicions that groups harbor behind closed doors. Despite the demographics, nearly all of the elected officials who represent the area are black.
''To some extent there is always unity and there is always tension because there is competition for dwindling resources,'' said Marqueece Harris-Dawson, the executive director of Community Coalition, a group that has worked in South Los Angeles for decades. ''People can live together and not see things through the lens of race most of the time, because at some point everyone is getting frustrated by the same problems.''
He looked across the street from his office and pointed to a lot whose buildings were destroyed in the riots, where Bill Clinton and other political leaders stood in 1992 promising a dawn of a new economy in the area. The lot has still not been rebuilt.

HEADLINE: Muddy Waters

BYLINE: By PATRICK M. CRONIN. 
Patrick M. Cronin is the director of the Asia program at the Center for a New American Security and the editor and a co-author of ''Cooperation From Strength: The United States, China and the South China Sea.''

 BODY:
Washington
THIS month's maritime standoff between China and the Philippines in the South China Sea isn't the first time the region's navies have gone toe-to-toe. But while past tensions revolved around resources under the ocean floor, this most recent event is part of a growing strategic rivalry pitting Chinese power against the United States and its East Asian allies. How Washington responds may determine the prospects for continued peace in the Pacific.
The latest crisis arose after the pocket-size Philippine Navy, with an old United States Coast Guard cutter as its new flagship, tried to apprehend Chinese fishermen it claimed were operating illegally near the Scarborough Shoal. China then sent two surveillance vessels -- part of a recent effort to protect its claims in the East and South China Seas -- to block the Philippine ship. 
The message was stark: escalate and risk a violent run-in with the Chinese Navy, or stand down and negotiate with Beijing from a position of weakness.
Manila wisely chose the latter, first substituting a civilian vessel for its combat vessel, and then containing the dispute through diplomatic channels. But China was also sending a flare to Washington, to the effect that American efforts to strengthen the military capacity of its regional allies would be checked.
It's easy to see the standoff as an act of quasi-aggression, but it's not. Because China is looking for influence rather than spoiling for a fight, it will seek a minimal show of force, as it did in the Scarborough incident by sending surveillance vessels instead of warships. Drawing attention to its rapid military modernization or its intensifying nationalist sentiment, after all, could undermine China's core interests.
The key take-away from the recent showdown is that the United States needs to remain coolheaded. Not only are such skirmishes at sea inevitable, but they are also of minor consequence -- assuming they are managed shrewdly.
Given our allies' overlapping interests in the South China Sea, we are bound to feel pressure to act aggressively against what appears to be Chinese expansionism. But as wiser heads in the United States have understood for decades, China is not truly expansionist. Its mercantilist international policies have material rather than imperial ambitions. China is testing the limits, not necessarily trying to pick a fight.
And we would do well to remember that for all their differences, China and the United States are not the cold war ideological adversaries of old. They both benefit enormously from an open global maritime commons. Globalization is possible only because of the unfettered sea lanes over which the vast majority of goods and resources move around the world. And the South China Sea, which joins the Indian and Pacific Oceans, is the narrow throat of our globalized economy.
That said, we shouldn't ignore the underlying risk in such incidents, either. At least in the South China Sea, China's military might will continue to bump up against the American Navy's role as guarantor of freedom of the seas.
Nor will the two powers always see eye to eye. The United States has a treaty commitment to help defend the Philippines, but it has always been careful to maintain neutrality over sovereignty disputes. American diplomatic exertions have thus gone into supporting multilateral approaches that would make it more difficult for one power -- China -- to coerce its neighbors.
China, on the other hand, prefers to deal with the players in the region one by one, starting with a country like the Philippines, which it knows lacks the military capacity to defend its disparate islands.
While the current standoff may be under control, more are likely to occur, especially as our allies turn to us for protection -- something we may see at next week's meeting between the United States and the Philippines in Washington. And it hasn't helped that soon after the dispute began, the United States and the Philippines started a long-planned military exercise nearby involving thousands of soldiers, sailors and Marines.
At the same time, separate disputes are guaranteed to continue among the countries around the South China Sea -- including Malaysia, Vietnam and Japan as well as China and the Philippines -- as long as oil and natural gas continue to be discovered under its waters.
Should a fight erupt, China is increasingly ready to rumble. Years of double-digit growth in its defense budgets are providing a historic land power with a blue-water naval capability and missile and air forces that put the American military presence in East Asia at risk.
This new reality, in short, recommends a specific course of action, one we are at risk of losing sight of: namely, to understand that China is testing the waters and sending signals but nothing more -- but also to respond with precise, measured steps to ensure it doesn't push the limits too far.
The maritime drama near Scarborough Shoal is just another salvo in a growing strategic rivalry that can be managed but not resolved. A resolute but prudent American position that seeks region-wide cooperation on common rules, but backed by American strength, remains the best means of keeping the waters tranquil.

HEADLINE: A Test for Arizona's Immigration Law

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Peter J. Spiro's take on Arizona's draconian anti-immigration law, S.B. 1070 (''Let Arizona's Law Stand,'' Op-Ed, April 23), is the free-market approach to legislation.
He urges the Supreme Court, which hears arguments on Wednesday, to uphold the law so it can ''wither away on its own.'' Mr. Spiro would let targeted populations suffer economic disaster, injustice, prejudice and false arrest until the pain of this legislation forces its repeal. 
Social justice demands that those most helpless and disadvantaged have the protection of law. Mr. Spiro's solution is heartless, antisocial and exploitative.
WILLIAM O. BEEMAN Minneapolis, April 23, 2012
The writer is chairman of the anthropology department at the University of Minnesota.
To the Editor:
Peter J. Spiro makes a curious case for Supreme Court inaction. He acknowledges, almost parenthetically, that federal law trumps state initiatives on matters of immigration status, and that these state laws ''are misguided at best, mean-spirited and racially tainted at worst.'' Then, he argues that ''immigrant interests'' would be better served if the court upholds the Arizona statute at issue.
How so? By Mr. Spiro's reckoning, economic imperatives would steadily drive a new political agenda. Arizona, after all, has already lost tens of millions of dollars in convention business as a result of S.B. 1070.
Companies large and small would continue to shun Arizona and other states viewed as anti-immigrant, Mr. Spiro says. In the end, Arizona's law would ''wither away on its own,'' as would, presumably, similar laws in other states.
Mr. Spiro may be right, but aren't such unintended consequences beside the point? Shouldn't we expect the justices to decide the case on the merits?
Or have we come to that sorry state where such expectations seem merely naive, given our polarization in politics and, yes, in judicial decision-making, too?
MIKE RUBY Cave Creek, Ariz., April 23, 2012
To the Editor:
Business interests do not oppose anti-immigration state laws such as this out of humanity. Corporate interests like illegal immigrants because they provide an oversupply of cheap laborers who have absolutely no power.
This is why -- to cite just one example -- the wages of meat packers have declined from around $18 an hour (inflation-adjusted) in the mid-1970s to about $11 an hour at present, and the conditions they labor under have become atrocious over the last generation.
This is why many pro-big-business Republicans such as our last president supported amnesty until the base made that support toxic.
And this is why Cesar Chavez, the legendary founder of the United Farm Workers, denounced illegal immigrants to the federal authorities.
DAVID C. HOLZMAN Lexington, Mass., April 23, 2012
To the Editor:
Re ''Defining Moment on Immigration'' (front page, April 23):
I know someone who is living in the United States illegally. He is European, has fair hair and fair skin, and speaks English perfectly. Does anyone truly believe that if he were stopped by the police in one of the states with harsh immigration laws, he would be asked to prove he was in the country legally?
Clearly, the answer is no, which shows that these laws are not really about immigration. They are about race and ethnicity, nothing more and nothing less.
Expressing such sentiments openly would be unacceptable. So instead the states passing these laws, and the groups promoting them, claim that what they are really concerned about is jobs, resources, security and the rule of law. But the blatant racial profiling that these laws engender demonstrates how false these claims are.

HEADLINE: Robust Quarterly Earnings Buoy Markets

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose on Tuesday, lifted by strong earnings reports and upbeat outlooks from big manufacturers like 3M.
The Nasdaq finished lower, weighed down by caution ahead of the postclosing release of Apple's earnings report.
Apple's results turned out surprisingly strong, however, as its quarterly revenue handily beat Wall Street's estimates. Its stock rose more than 7 percent in extended trading after closing at $560.28, down 2 percent. 
Its stock has fallen in recent weeks. At the close on Tuesday, Apple's stock was up 38 percent for the year compared with earlier this month, when it was up nearly 60 percent for the year to date.
During the regular session, 3M reported an increase in quarterly profit and slightly lifted its full-year outlook, helping the Dow. AT&T also helped lift the Dow after reporting a profit of $3.6 billion in its last quarter, topping Wall Street estimates.
The earnings season so far has been stronger than analysts expected. With results in from 153 S.& P. 500 companies, more than three-fourths have topped analysts' estimates, according to Thomson Reuters Proprietary Research.
''U.S. corporate earnings are actually coming in pretty strong,'' said Natalie Trunow, chief investment officer of equities at Calvert Investment Management in Bethesda, Md.
''Negatives are being paid attention to more at the moment than the positives, but the positive earnings reports are providing some support here.''
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 74.39 points, or 0.58 percent, to close at 13,001.56. The S.& P. rose 5.03 points, or 0.37 percent, to 1,371.97. But the Nasdaq composite index slipped 8.85 points, or 0.30 percent, to 2,961.60.
Adding to weakness in tech, Netflix sank 13.9 percent to $87.68, a day after it forecast slower subscriber growth this quarter.
Texas Instruments forecast second-quarter revenue growth above estimates, signaling the end of a prolonged inventory-related decline in demand, but the results were not enough to counter the broader weakness in the technology sector. Its stock slid 1.7 percent to $31.36.
Many analysts have cautioned that a correction is near, given the stock market's sharp rally since October. The S.& P. 500 is up 9.1 percent so far for the year.
''When you see the big spread between the Dow and the Nasdaq, you know that there's a bit of a flight to safety there, so people are leaving the over-the-counter stocks and buying the higher-quality securities. So New York didn't look as strong as it might have appeared,'' said Douglas Davis, chief executive of Davis-Rea in Toronto.
AT&T advanced 3.6 percent to $31.72, while 3M gained 1.6 percent to $88.49. Shares of United Technologies, which also reported results that beat forecasts, edged up 0.1 percent to close at $79.85.
Economic data took a back seat to earnings news.
Single-family home prices rose for the first time in 10 months in an encouraging sign the battered sector was starting to stabilize, according to the latest S.& P./Case-Shiller report.
Separately, the government said that single-family home sales sagged to their lowest level in four months, but that sales in the previous three months were revised higher than initially thought. Consumer confidence edged slightly lower in April, according to a report from the Conference Board, a private research group.
Interest rates were slightly higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 11/32, to 100 8/32, and the yield rose to 1.97 percent from 1.94 percent late Monday.

HEADLINE: As Demand Rises, Ohio's Steel Mills Shake Off the Rust and Expand

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

 BODY:
CANTON, Ohio -- The Ohio steel industry, led by a drilling boom in the gas and oil industry and a resuscitated demand for cars and light trucks, is growing again. Steel makers across the state are racing to keep pace with plans to add a total of two million square feet of production space at a cost of $1.5 billion.
At the Timken Company's mill here on Faircrest Street, orders for steel from domestic and export markets plunged so low in May 2009 that the plant operated just four days that month.
Nearly three years later, with demand for steel soaring and the Faircrest mill operating around the clock, Timken has started building a $200 million, 83,000-square-foot addition that will increase the plant's production. 
''The need for specialty steel, much of it for oil and natural gas producers, is high in the United States and around the world,'' said Salvatore J. Miraglia Jr., the president of Timken's steel group. ''We see demand in that market continuing to be healthy for quite some time.''
That optimism is reflected in Timken's new building, which will rise 26 stories high and will sharply expand the plant's capacity to cast steel billets to be made into parts for drilling platforms, heavy equipment, and other oil and gas industry tools. Two other new buildings also are under way at the 27-year-old mill, one of which will house a new forge press and a facility where minerals and other compounds that strengthen finished steel will be added to molten metal.
In October, United States Steel opened a $100 million, 325,000-square-foot mill at its Lorain plant to manufacture steel pipe for the drilling industry. Vallourec & Mannesmann, a French company, is completing a $650 million, 1.1 million-square-foot steel pipe mill in Youngstown, and is building a separate 200,000-square-foot mill nearby to add threads to the pipes. Both plants serve the oil and gas sector.
United States Steel is collaborating with a Japan-based partner, Kobe Steel, to build a $400 million, 454,000-square-foot addition to what is known as the Pro-Tec plant in Leipsic, south of Toledo, to serve the growing market for high-tensile lightweight steel used by makers of fuel-efficient vehicles.
''We haven't had this kind of expansion in steel since the 1980s,'' said Eric Burkland, the president of the Ohio Manufacturers' Association. ''It's a tremendous turnaround.''
When all the projects are completed this year and next, those plants alone are expected to add roughly 630 new manufacturing jobs. The unemployment rate in Ohio was 7.5 percent in March, below the 8.2 percent national rate in March, and down from a statewide peak of 10.6 percent in July 2009.
The projects also will help Ohio's steel industry, the nation's second-largest behind Indiana's, to exceed the annual production figures of 14 million to 15 million tons that were achieved in the years before 2009, when production dropped to 4.8 million tons and investment in plants was just $166 million, according to the Ohio Steel Council, a state trade group. One reason for the industry's revival, said Mr. Burkland, was anticipated: the recovery of the auto industry. ''People feel more confident and they are buying cars again,'' he said.
Auto manufacturing in the United States is a big buyer of steel. Carmakers expect this year to sell 13.8 million cars and light trucks in the United States, and could reach 14 million to 15 million sales by 2014, according to monthly sales figures and industry estimates. Sales peaked at 17 million vehicles in 2005, but plunged to 10.9 million sales in 2009 in the depths of the recession. The Ohio Department of Development, in a February 2011 report, said 72,000 people were employed in the state's car and light truck vehicle assembly plants, and dozens of parts manufacturing plants.
But the surge in oil and gas drilling and the swift rise in the market for steel pipes and oil field equipment has come as a surprise. The clanging of long lengths of steel pipes being heated and cooled, pounded and straightened inside a new finishing plant at United States Steel in Lorain provides a rare inside view of the industry's revival in Ohio.
The bright lights and charged furnaces, the powerful hiss of cold water on hot steel, and the jarring din that makes ear plugs mandatory safety equipment describe a company and an industry making investments few thought possible only a few years ago.
''We're shipping pipe to drilling operations in Pennsylvania, North Dakota, Texas, China,'' said John Wilkinson, United States Steel's interim plant manager. ''All over the country. All over the world. Some of it is being used here in Ohio.''
New production practices have made it practical to tap the dense and deep hydrocarbon-rich shale beneath much of the Great Plains, the Gulf Coast, the Rocky Mountain West and the mid-Atlantic states, and they are being tapped at a frantic pace. Last year, according to the Energy Information Administration of the Department of Energy, a monthly average of 1,876 oil and gas rigs were in operation, the highest count since 2008. More than 45,000 oil and gas wells were drilled in 2011, and a third of the nation's natural gas is now generated from shale.
In eastern and central Ohio, drillers focus on two layers of deep gas- and oil-bearing shale, the Marcellus and Utica. Early production results indicate the Utica wells alone are capable of producing millions of cubic feet of gas and hundreds of barrels of oil daily.
It takes a lot of steel to tap reserves that generally lie a mile or more beneath the surface. Each of the drilling pipes rolling off the production line in Lorain is 4.5 inches in diameter, 50 feet long and weighs 850 pounds. Drilling vertically to the depth of the shale in Ohio, and horizontally through it to tap gas and oil, typically takes 200 to 250 lengths of pipe -- or some 100 tons of steel. As of April 8, Ohio had issued 207 shale drilling permits.
David Mustine, the general manager of JobsOhio, a state economic development group, said that natural gas was a favored fuel for heating steel and that the new supplies were lowering prices, saving steel plants millions of dollars a year. ''Drilling for natural gas has given Ohio steel producers a larger market for their products and a competitive advantage on cost,'' Mr. Mustine said.
In Canton, Timken executives said they expected to complete the Faircrest mill's additions by 2014, and production will increase to 925,000 tons annually from 750,000 tons this year. Mr. Miraglia said 425 people worked at the plant and that automation in the new buildings most likely meant that few if any jobs would be added.
Behind him, long, rectangular slabs of steel the color of the sun were being poured, turned and pounded in a fury of smoke and flame. ''This is the largest investment made in this plant since we built it,'' he said.

HEADLINE: That Brawl? Elite Club Wants Nothing Said

BYLINE: By ANDY NEWMAN and CHRISTOPHER REEVE

 BODY:
The 144-year-old New York Athletic Club is known for its nurturing role in the history of American amateur sports, the hundreds of Olympic medals its members have won, and its fancy headquarters on Central Park South featuring squash courts, guest rooms, a library and a strict dress code.
It has no wish, apparently, to be known for an unscheduled fisticuffs session: a knock-down, drag-out, coed brawl that unfolded at the club's Tap Room in the wee hours of April 13 and ended with two people sent to the hospital and three men under arrest. 
''I cannot state forcefully enough how abhorrent this event is to me,'' the club's president, S. Colin Neill, wrote in a letter to members on April 18. Then he got to the point:
''Distribution via the various social media of photographs and letters that are detrimental to the club and its reputation will not be tolerated. It is the responsibility of each and every member to protect and embellish the standing of the N.Y.A.C.''
The club's attempt to bury the matter did not succeed. Last Friday, a witness account that had been making the rounds was posted on the blog Wall Street Jackass. ''It was the best fight I've ever seen,'' the anonymous witness wrote. ''Young people, old people, girls, members, nonmembers - it was a nondiscriminatory ragematch.''
The witness's note says that the initial fight seemed to have commenced over a woman, and escalated into a brawl involving three fighting ''wolf packs.'' Tables were overturned or moved to the room's periphery to create a ''lion's pit'' for the battle.
Other highlights, the witness wrote, included ''probably 2 broken noses,'' ''glasses thrown,'' a woman cut badly enough to require stitches and a ''fat pudgy kid'' who laid out a larger man with a blow to the head and was tackled by a crowd.
The police, who arrived after much of the dust had settled, confirmed only the arrests of three men: Peter Doran, 28, of Glen Head on the North Shore of Nassau County, charged with misdemeanor assault and accused of punching a 49-year-old man in the face; Matthew O'Grady, 31, of neighboring Glen Cove, charged with misdemeanor assault on a 48-year-old man; and Colin Drowica, 30, also of Glen Head, who was charged with attempted menacing. Mr. Drowica, a police spokeswoman said, grabbed a 58-year-old security guard's arm and ''made some kind of aggressive motion with his fist to the victim, threatening physical injury.''
There is a Colin Drowica listed on LinkedIn as a director at Knight Capital Group, and a brokerage database shows a Colin Drowica at Knight Capital who during a period of unemployment was based in Glen Head.
The Fire Department, which runs the Emergency Medical Service, said one man with a lacerated head was taken to New York Downtown Hospital and another man with unspecified injuries was taken to St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center.
Last Friday at the club, which costs $8,500 to join and more than $3,000 a year for a membership, James O'Brien, the director of communications, declined to confirm what the witness described as the ''epicness'' of the brawl, or much of anything else.
''We are not making any comment about anything,'' Mr. O'Brien said when asked about the brawl and the response letter. He then affirmed the club's policy of silence on internal matters - a policy reinforced by Mr. Neill in his letter to the membership.
''The club's constitution does not permit publicizing internal matters of the club, or otherwise undermining the private nature of the club,'' he wrote. Those who breach the club's norms ''will be subject to disciplinary action.''
A call to the club on Tuesday inquiring whether an episode involving the summoning of New York's Police and Fire Departments was really an ''internal matter'' was not returned.

HEADLINE: Stylish Hotels Sprouting in Brooklyn and Queens

BYLINE: By SUSAN STELLIN

 BODY:
The New York City hotel market managed to defy the slump most of the country experienced during and after the recession.
Occupancy rates in the city were 85 percent last year, compared with a national average of 60 percent. And despite a tough market for financing, at least 15 hotels opened in the five boroughs in 2011 -- roughly half of them outside Manhattan. From 2006 to 2011, 42 percent of the city's new hotels were built in the outer boroughs, according to data from NYC & Company, the local tourism organization.
Brooklyn's hotel building boom began a few years ago, and competitors continue to pop up around the borough, mostly focused in popular neighborhoods like Williamsburg and the up-and-coming downtown.
Lately, Long Island City in Queens has become another hotel hot spot, as guests trade the congestion of Midtown for skyline views and cheaper prices, just one subway stop from Manhattan. 
''My idea was to offer proximity, a good view and a good value,'' said Henry Zilberman, the owner of Z NYC Hotel, which opened in Long Island City last July. ''We try to be about 30 to 40 percent off a similar hotel in Manhattan -- that's our draw.''
Easy access to Manhattan has become part of the standard pitch for borough hotels, which count subway stops and list nearby trains prominently on their Web sites. Free Internet access is practically a universal amenity outside Manhattan, and a rooftop bar with a view follows close behind.
Mr. Zilberman includes free domestic and international phone calls and says he is catering to the ''Apple crowd'': guests toting MacBooks and iPads. He built the 100-room hotel on land he bought in 1996 to park cars for his limousine business.
Long Island City's advantages include quick trips to La Guardia and Kennedy airports; new restaurants and parks that have joined nearby cultural attractions like MoMA PS1, the Museum of the Moving Image and Socrates Sculpture Park; and proximity to film and television production facilities like Silvercup Studios. Citigroup's office tower is also a factor for developers, who like to locate hotels near commercial hubs.
Other recent additions to Long Island City include the boutique Hotel Vetiver, which opened in January, and a Four Points by Sheraton that had its debut last May, promoting Manhattan skyline views. A Wyndham Garden hotel welcomed its first guests this spring, and Marriott is putting the finishing touches on a Fairfield Inn & Suites, which is scheduled to open this summer. Marriott was a pioneer in the outer boroughs, with a 666-room hotel that opened in 1998 near the Brooklyn Bridge that dominated the market long before newer competitors arrived. But these days, smaller midmarket properties are more typical, even in Manhattan, because it is still a challenge to get financing to build a large luxury hotel.
''It's easier to build these small hotels that are moderately priced because they're less expensive,'' said John Wolf, a Marriott spokesman. ''And you get a return on your investment more quickly.''
While the Brooklyn Bridge Marriott still captures big event and conference business -- it was just named the official hotel of the Barclays Center, the new Nets arena -- downtown Brooklyn's hotel center has been shifting to Duffield Street, where Sheraton and Aloft have opened properties in the last two years.
The 128-room Hotel 718 is set to join them on Duffield Street this spring, with amenities that include a spa, a rooftop deck and a restaurant called the Marrow, run by Harold Dieterle and Alicia Nosenzo, co-owners of Kin Shop and Perilla in the West Village.
''That street in particular is going to be kind of a hotel row,'' said Brian Dunne, the director of marketing for Benchmark Hospitality International, the operator of Hotel 718.
With all the residential development in the area, Mr. Dunne said downtown Brooklyn was becoming more of an evening destination, rather than a neighborhood that empties out when municipal and corporate workers go home.
Hotel 718 is part of a more upscale wave of independent hotels opening in Brooklyn, with a carefully fashioned restaurant or bar that aims to attract locals as well as hotel guests. And those guests tend to be more stylish and wealthier travelers, not just budget-conscious visitors who cannot afford to stay near Times Square.
''Brooklyn isn't being viewed as the less expensive option to Manhattan,'' Mr. Dunne said. ''It's a place people are starting to want to come to first rather than second.''
The quarry for hotel developers in Williamsburg is the travelers at the vanguard of fashion, music and design.
The 64-room King & Grove Williamsburg opened on North 12th Street last November, hoping to attract international travelers and the creative set. Originally named the Hotel Williamsburg, the property was recently bought by King & Grove, which also owns Ruschmeyer's in Montauk and the Tides South Beach in Miami.
Some rooms have balconies overlooking the outdoor pool, and the new owners are working on a rooftop bar and shifting to a more casual focus for the restaurant.
''We've kind of become a retreat for parents who are visiting their 30-year-old son who just had his first kid with his wife,'' said Maggie Houston, a spokeswoman for King & Grove. ''We really do have a pretty big mix at the hotel.''
Just down the street, the 72-room Wythe Hotel plans to open in May, in a former factory on the Williamsburg waterfront. The guest room options include two ''band rooms'' that sleep four or six people in bunk beds, and the hotel's restaurant, Reynards, is run by Andrew Tarlow, of the popular area restaurants Marlow & Sons and Diner.
Other hotels are venturing into less-trafficked parts of Brooklyn: a Fairfield Inn & Suites opened last July on Third Avenue in Gowanus. And Hotel BPM is expected to open later this spring on 33rd Street in Sunset Park.
Developed by the hip-hop D.J. Bijal Panwala, Hotel BPM -- as in ''beats per minute'' -- streams a soundtrack selected by the owner in its public spaces. Soundproofed guest rooms offer an amenity many travelers will appreciate: laptop-size safes.
Sean Hennessey, the chief executive of Lodging Advisors, which evaluates the financial prospects of hotels, said one cloud over the otherwise sunny New York City market was that prices had not matched the strength of occupancy rates.
''In 2011, room rates were still 18 percent below where they were in 2007,'' Mr. Hennessey said, adding that hotels in Brooklyn or Queens command rates that are $50 to $60 less than a property of comparable quality in Manhattan.
''That's good for travelers,'' he said. ''But not as good for hotel developers.''
Still, Mr. Hennessey said, areas outside Manhattan are well suited to the midprice hotels that are popular now and can often be built on a faster timetable.
''You can get a project up and running somewhat easier in the boroughs,'' he said, ''which I think is why we're seeing more interest there.''

HEADLINE: Using U.S. Dollars, Zimbabwe Finds a Problem: No Change

BYLINE: By LYDIA POLGREEN

 BODY:
HARARE, Zimbabwe -- When Zimbabweans say they are waiting for change, they are usually talking about politics. After all, the country has had the same leader since 1980.
But these days, Robson Madzumbara spends a lot of time quite literally waiting around for change. Pocket change, that is. He waits for it at supermarkets, on the bus, at the vegetable stall he runs and just about anywhere he buys or sells anything.
''We never have enough change,'' he said, manning the vegetable stall he has run for the past two decades. ''Change is a big problem in Zimbabwe.'' 
For years, Zimbabwe was infamous for the opposite problem: mind-boggling inflation. Trips to the supermarket required ridiculous boxloads of cash. By January 2009, the country was churning out bills worth 100 trillion Zimbabwean dollars, which were soon so worthless they would not buy a loaf of bread (the notes now circulate on eBay, as gag gifts).
But since Zimbabwe started using the United States dollar as its currency in 2009, it has run into a surprising quandary. Once worth too little, money in Zimbabwe is now worth too much.
''For your average Zimbabwean, a dollar is a lot of money,'' said Tony Hawkins, an economist at the University of Zimbabwe.
Zimbabweans call it ''the coin problem.'' Simply put, the country hardly has any. Coins are heavy, making them expensive to ship here. But in a nation where millions of people live on a dollar or two a day, trying to get every transaction to add up to a whole dollar has proved a national headache.
Still, the new predicament is an improvement. By virtually wiping out inflation, analysts say, use of the United States dollar saved Zimbabwe from total economic collapse and brought the country back from the brink. The country's political future remains deeply unsettled since the disputed 2008 election gave way to a shaky power-sharing government. But its economy is growing, if from a very low base.
Zimbabweans have devised a variety of solutions to get around the change problem, none of them entirely satisfactory. At supermarkets, impulse purchases have become almost compulsory. When the total is less than a dollar, the customer is offered candy, a pen or matches to make up the difference. Some shops offer credit slips, a kind of scrip that has begun to circulate here.
But for small merchants who sell handfuls of tomatoes, onions and lemons to poor people, customers may not always have the luxury of buying a dollar's worth of merchandise.
Christine Mhalanga, 27, a hospital orderly, went to buy tomatoes from Evelyn Chikandiwa, who runs another vegetable stall. She selected a stack of tomatoes and some onions for stew. Mercifully, her purchase was exactly a dollar because Ms. Chikandiwa had no coins in her gingham apron to break any bills.
''I already had to buy clothespins I don't need today,'' Ms. Mhalanga said. ''A dollar is a lot of money for me. I need every bit of it. Trust me.''
According to the United States Federal Reserve, at least five countries have officially adopted the United States dollar as their currency. Several more, like Zimbabwe, use it almost exclusively but hold on to a national currency, even if it is not in circulation.
But United States coins seldom circulate more than 100 miles beyond the country's borders because of their weight and high shipping costs.
Most countries that use the dollar get around this problem by minting local coins: Ecuador uses the dollar as legal tender but mints centavo coins. The government guarantees that anyone who wants to exchange 100 Ecuadorean centavos for a genuine United States dollar can do so.
But that requires confidence in the local government, something that is in even shorter supply here than coins. Zimbabweans say they want no legal tender issued by their government.
''I won't accept any Zimbabwean money,'' said Ms. Chikandiwa, the vegetable seller, who saw her life savings wiped out by hyperinflation. Back then, the value of the currency dropped so fast that prices for milk, cigarettes, sugar and flour would change by the hour, if not the minute. These days, Ms. Chikandiwa keeps all her earnings in cash, not trusting her precious dollars to the bank. ''We can't trust these people,'' she said, referring to the government.
Many Zimbabweans use coins from neighboring South Africa. But that presents its own difficulties. South African coins -- the currency is the rand -- are in short supply. Complicating matters, the rand, like most currencies, fluctuates against the dollar, making prices tough to fix.
Tendai Biti, Zimbabwe's finance minister and a senior politician in the opposition Movement for Democratic Change, said that he had tried, to no avail, to find a solution.
''We have been seeking help from the Fed in the States, but we haven't got a lot of joy,'' he said, an edge of frustration seeping into his voice.
Supermarket cashiers are frustrated, too, and they devise their own ways to defuse the tension. Every transaction is a miniature drama of anticipation, annoyance and negotiation. The shopper tries to add up purchases to avoid needing change. And at the register, shoppers must make up their minds on how to compensate for failure.
As Lydia Zhuwawu worked the cash register at the Classic Supermarket in Harare during the evening rush this week, she tried to size up her customers to guess what they might accept in lieu of change.
A basket full of tomatoes and onions comes to $2.80. Ms. Zhuwawu has two well-worn singles for the $5 note, but no nickels or dimes.
''Sorry, no change,'' Ms. Zhuwawu said, waving a hand at her assortment of wares.
The customer chooses a packet of four aspirin, 5 cents apiece.
Next up: a customer with $3.90 worth of groceries. Ms. Zhuwawu offers up a steel bottle opener.
''This is for 10 cents?'' the customer asks, wearily. She takes it.
With single dollar bills in heavy rotation, they tend to suffer a lot of wear and tear. Many are filthy -- almost black. Ms. Zhuwawu takes note of the cleanliness of the legal tender each customer hands her. Two-dollar bills, rare in the United States, circulate widely here.
Most people, she said, have a sense of humor about the problem. After all that Zimbabwe has been through, it is not that big a burden, she said. It is a give-and-take.
A man comes in to buy staples. A box is 30 cents; he has only a dollar. Her change drawer is empty.
''Just take it,'' Ms. Zhuwawu said. ''It's your lucky day. Nothing is free in Zimbabwe.''

HEADLINE: Disability Insurance Causes Pain

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER

 BODY:
Every year, when the trustees of Social Security and Medicare publish their report on the programs' finances they set off a round of partisan bickering about the solvency of the twin programs covering pensions and health care for retired Americans.
Every year, a vitally important issue gets lost in the din: disability insurance payments, which account for almost $1 out of every $5 spent by Social Security, are growing out of control.
Disability insurance takes too many workers out of the job market prematurely. It reduces their lifetime income and, to top it off, slows economic growth. Yet in contrast to the heated arguments about Social Security and Medicare, fixing the disability problem inspires hardly any discussion.
The trustees reported Monday that the government made $128.9 billion in insurance payments to 10.6 million disabled workers and their family members last year, 25 percent more than it received from payroll taxes. 
On top of that, five million adults received $33 billion worth of disability benefits from the Supplemental Security Income program for poor Americans. Medicare spent more than $90 billion on benefits for disabled workers, who are eligible for the government health insurance after two years on disability, regardless of their age. And Medicaid spent $110 billion more on the poor disabled.
The disability program offers essential support for disabled workers -- many of whom have no chance of holding another job. Some of its growth reflects changes in the population: we are growing older and becoming fragile with age. Similarly, disability rates among women should be expected to rise because more of them entered the work force.
But these factors account for only a small share of the growing cost. They fail to explain why the rolls of the disabled are expanding rapidly for men of all ages, even though Americans are generally in better health.
''The health of nonelderly Americans is improving consistently, and we have more technology to help people at work,'' observed Mark Duggan, an economist at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who has advised Social Security on the assumptions underpinning the trustees' forecasts. ''Yet every year the fraction of people on this program is growing.''
The breakneck growth in the disability program is not simply about demography. Rather, it is driven by two other factors: a job market that has become tough to navigate for workers with low skills, especially men, whose jobs have gone abroad or been taken by machines; and a basic flaw in the disability program that discourages people from ever working again.
In hard times, disability becomes an attractive alternative for unemployed people who might have toiled through back pain or depression if the job market were strong. A study of coal miners in Appalachia found that disability applications spiked when energy prices fell, underscoring how workers turn to the program as a response to layoffs. In 2009, when the unemployment rate rose to 10 percent, applications for disability jumped by a fifth.
The problem is that once someone goes on disability, it is extremely unlikely that that person will ever go back to work, regardless of job opportunities or medical condition. So disability can help turn a temporary stint of unemployment into a permanent condition.
The disability insurance program was meant for another era, in the late 1950s when working conditions were tougher and disabilities were expected to put an end to someone's working life. It was hard to get into the program -- for starters, it required applicants to be out of the labor force. Once a worker was accepted, nobody worried about trying to help him back into the work force. He was, after all, disabled.
In the mid-1980s, however, Congress softened the criteria. The Social Security Administration, which usually required medical diagnoses as proof of disability, was required to give more weight to subjective factors like pain. This opened the door for applicants who reported mental ailments like anxiety, or back pain and other muscular problems, claims more difficult to verify.
Collecting disability became even easier as rejected applicants were allowed to appeal before an administrative judge without anyone from Social Security present to defend its decision. So even though two-thirds of applicants were initially rejected, 50 to 60 percent ultimately joined the program.
And the rolls soared, outstripping population growth. There are 1.5 times more people on disability than there were in 1990. Almost one in 20 Americans from the ages of 25 to 64 now collects benefits, more than twice the share of two decades ago. And the cost has risen in tandem. Disability outlays have grown about 5.6 percent a year after inflation in the last two decades, compared with just 2.2 percent for other Social Security spending.
Though the intent was laudable, Congressional efforts to help disabled workers were short-sighted. Crucially, lawmakers failed to consider the long-term effect of easing entry to a program that would take many young workers out of the job market for good. Congress offered nothing to help recipients into less physically demanding work that might be appropriate despite their disabilities. It offered nothing for employers who kept hurt workers in a job.
The trustees said on Monday that the disability fund will be exhausted by 2016, two years earlier than they estimated last year. Disability payments won't stop. But once the fund is depleted, a bigger share of payroll taxes will be diverted from the fund that pays benefits to old age pensioners and their survivors.
The growth in disability payouts has other drawbacks. The payments hardly provide a living, at just over $1,100 a month, on average, plus Medicare coverage. Beneficiaries are allowed to earn up to about $1,000 more, but only about one in 10 makes any extra money. Though disability might offer a needed respite now, with unemployment exceeding 8 percent, keeping productive people out of work will harm the economy in the long run.
The good news is that the disability program is easier to fix. Unlike Social Security and Medicaid, whose financial strains are driven mostly by demographic forces, the disability program suffers from artificial woes that can be corrected. Fixing the system requires providing incentives to enable disabled workers to continue working if they can.
This doesn't mean slashing benefits. But it does mean offering incentives so that disability is no longer the first, most desirable choice for an unemployed worker with a back problem. Mr. Duggan and David Autor of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have suggested several ways to do this.
For instance, employers who send lots of workers into the disability program pay no more into the system than those who send none. This could change if employers were required to buy private insurance, whose premiums increase as more workers draw benefits. The public system's finances would improve. And bosses would have an incentive to change working conditions or add rehabilitation programs to keep workers with physical and mental ailments on the job.
The disability program could also let workers apply for benefits while still working -- encouraging them to take a less demanding job at a lower wage. And requirements to join the system could be tightened, including closer monitoring of recipients to check for improvements.
Despite growing concern about the budget deficit, nobody seems to have noticed disability's billion-dollar inefficiencies. To be fair, disability payments create a barrier that politicians find hard to breach, lest they appear heartless and unfair by slowing enrollment and moving some people off payments.
Still, disability payments are not an effective solution to long-term unemployment. A good response might be a more generous form of earned income tax credit for adults with no dependents, something that would encourage disabled beneficiaries to work. And the system itself could be reconceived as a way to help the disabled cope in the job market and leave it only when they must.
The Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 argues that the nation must assure disabled citizens with ''equality of opportunity, full participation, independent living, and economic self-sufficiency.'' Disability insurance does not live up to this standard.

HEADLINE: U.S. Files First Criminal Charges in BP Spill Case

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS; Reporting was contributed by John M. Broder in Washington, John Schwartz in New York and Daniel Cadis in Houston.

 BODY:
HOUSTON -- Two years after the immense BPoil spill that killed 11 people and blackened beaches along the Gulf of Mexico, federal prosecutors have filed the first criminal charges related to the accident, accusing a former company engineer of destroying evidence by deleting text messages that discussed the amount of oil leaking from the stricken well.
Federal authorities arrested the engineer, Kurt Mix of Katy, Tex., on Tuesday and charged him with two counts of obstruction of justice in a complaint filed in the Eastern District of Louisiana and unsealed on Tuesday.
However, court documents filed with the charges and Mr. Mix's relatively low rank within BP suggested that the charges were just the opening salvo in the government's case against the company and the contractors involved in the explosion of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig and oil spill on April 20, 2010. The stricken well spewed millions of barrels of oil over months, sickening birds and marine life, idling oil rigs and fishing vessels, and causing economic damages in the billions of dollars. 
The long-term effects of the spill are still being assessed, and the government has yet to levy fines against BP for the pollution it caused.
The attorney general, Eric H. Holder Jr., said the criminal investigation was still developing. ''The Deepwater Horizon task force is continuing its investigation into the explosion and will hold accountable those who violated the law in connection with the largest environmental disaster in U.S. history,'' he said in a statement.
The prosecution's interest in the text messages, legal analysts said, indicated that prosecutors might argue that corporate officers had wanted to hide the full extent of the spill to protect BP from fines and bolster its falling stock price.
BP has already reached a multibillion-dollar settlement with lawyers representing individuals and businesses for economic losses and medical claims. But criminal prosecution would be a stinging slap to the company, based in London.
It has tried to portray itself as doing everything it could to make amends for the accident. If criminal charges were brought against the company itself, its participation in government contracts could be suspended.
Richard J. Lazarus, a Harvard law school professor who was executive director of the panel appointed by President Obama to investigate the BP spill, said he would be surprised if Mr. Mix were the only person charged. ''The government is trying to use what they have against some people as leverage to implicate higher-ranking people,'' Mr. Lazarus said.
According to an affidavit filed with the criminal complaint, Mr. Mix, a drilling and completions project engineer for BP until last January, was involved in efforts to monitor and stop the oil leak.
In October 2010, despite notices from BP that he must retain all information about the well, Mr. Mix deleted a string of more than 200 text messages with a BP supervisor, the complaint said. Some of the messages suggested that company officials had known that an effort to stop the leak in the early days of the spill -- a procedure known as a top kill -- was likely to fail, in part because of the great amount of oil flowing out.
According to the affidavit, BP's internal estimates of the flow exceeded 15,000 barrels a day, far higher than the rate the company acknowledged at the time.
During the top kill procedure, senior BP executives, including Tony Hayward, then the chief executive, estimated that chances for success were 60 to 70 percent even as people involved in the effort were telling reporters that the flow was probably too powerful to control.
''The information contained in the arrest warrant raises anew questions whether BP was forthcoming with the government and the public about the size of the spill during the spring of 2010,'' said David M. Uhlmann, a law professor at the University of Michigan and former head of the Justice Department's environmental crimes section.
''If there is sufficient evidence, it is possible the government may charge BP and senior BP officials with misleading the government and the public about the size of the spill,'' he said.
Professor Uhlmann also suggested the company might have tried ''to bolster its stock price at a time when the stock price was plummeting.''
The flow rate of the spill was also important because the Clean Water Act sets a civil fine of $1,100 for every barrel of oil released in a spill, in addition to payments for cleanup and economic loss. And if the government determines that a spill was caused by gross negligence, the fine can jump to $4,300 a barrel.
''If people at BP knew and failed to disclose to the government what the flow rate was, that obstructed more than justice,'' Mr. Lazarus said. ''It may have impeded the effort to contain the flow and allowed it to continue longer than it did, increasing the damage.''
BP said in a statement Tuesday that it was cooperating with the Justice Department and other official investigations. ''BP had clear policies requiring preservation of evidence in this case and has undertaken substantial and ongoing efforts to preserve evidence,'' the company said. ''We will not comment on the government's case against former BP employee Kurt Mix.''
The criminal complaint said that in August 2010, the S.E.C., in coordination with the Justice Department, subpoenaed BP for all flow rate documents.
A few months later, the government said, Mr. Mix deleted from his iPhone more than 200 messages with a supervisor, and he deleted an additional 100 messages before the phone data was copied by a contractor working for BP lawyers.
Joan McPhee, Mr. Mix's lawyer, said the contents of the deleted messages were also available in e-mail and other messages provided to the government. ''These misguided charges over failure to retain text messages constitute startling government overreaching,'' she said.
According to the government, on May 26, when BP was trying but failing to plug the well, Mr. Mix sent a text that said, ''Too much flow rate -- over 15,000,'' an apparent reference to a rate of greater than 15,000 barrels a day. Two days later, the complaint noted, ''BP continued publicly to state that top kill was broadly proceeding according to plan.''
On May 29, the top kill procedure was stopped, the complaint noted, and ''BP's stock price dropped approximately 15 percent on the next trading day.''
A technician involved in BP's efforts to plug the well said on Tuesday that there were various opinions on the flow rate among the experts at the time.
The technician, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the internal workings of the response effort, said that Mr. Mix had personally resisted accepting the high estimates of some contractors, insisting that much less oil was flowing out.
BP has already spent $14 billion responding to the spill and paid $8 billion to individuals and businesses for damages related to the accident.
Investigations have shown there were multiple causes of the blowout, leaving the possibility of prosecution of not only BP, which designed the well, but also Halliburton, the company that was in charge of cementing the well, and Transocean, which owned and operated the rig itself.
Mr. Mix, wearing a light purple shirt and pair of khakis without a belt, surrendered in Houston. A judge agreed to release him on $100,000 bond but said that he could not travel outside of Texas and Louisiana.
If convicted, Mr. Mix faces a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 for each count.

HEADLINE: Push to Give Midsize Farms A Hub at a Bronx Market

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
Decades after the slow-food movement began championing the benefits of locally grown fruits and vegetables, pressure is mounting for New York City to stand up to big vendors and make room for the region's midsize farms at the Hunts Point wholesale produce market in the South Bronx.
The region has no big wholesale hub for local produce, and advocates of local food and farmers argue that this is the logical time to make it happen. The city is deep in lease negotiations with the cooperative that owns the 45-year-old market, which stretches across 105 acres of city land, and is exploring how to pay for much-needed renovations there.
Complicating matters, New Jersey is hoping to lure the cooperative and its 3,000 jobs across the Hudson River, which gives the city less leverage in pushing for change. And the cooperative's owners are wary of competition from the smaller farmers, whose costs do not include expensive labor contracts. 
Proponents of adding a wholesale farmers' market at Hunts Point say that even as the Bloomberg administration supports sustainability, only 4 percent of the $2.3 billion worth of food sold annually at Hunts Point comes from New York State, and only 8 percent from New Jersey. The rest is brought in from 47 other states and an estimated 55 countries, according to the cooperative.
''It is critical that state and city officials seize this opportunity,'' said Mark A. Izeman, a senior lawyer with the Natural Resources Defense Council, which advocates for farmland preservation in New York State and the environmental benefits of growing food locally. He said it was ''crazy'' that New York had not created a central wholesale hub for local food as cities like Paris and Toronto have.
In an interview in his office at the terminal, the co-op's co-president, Matthew D'Arrigo, said the issue of including midsize regional growers had not come up in negotiations with the city, but ''it's there.''
Mr. D'Arrigo said he was concerned that oversupply problems could worsen if midsize farmers were admitted. And New York State's limited growing season, about five months of the year, might not make the hub as successful as its supporters predict in any case, he added.
The city and the cooperative, which pays about $4.5 million a year in rent, are in exclusive negotiations on a new lease with the goal of reaching an accord by June 29. If they do not, New Jersey officials say, they are ready to reopen talks.
Local farm supporters want the city to insist that a new lease include year-round indoor space for New York growers that are modest in size yet too large to profit from the small green markets in the New York area's parks and streets. Such farms are typically under 300 acres in the Hudson Valley, on Long Island and in the upstate areas that can supply the city, according to studies.
Pressed on the issue, city officials would say only that their first priority is reaching an accord on the lease and on resolving nagging storage, refrigeration and traffic issues.
''Our current focus is on securing a long-term lease with the market co-op and creating a larger, modernized market,'' said Julie Wood, a spokeswoman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's office. So far, the city and state have committed to shouldering $137 million of an anticipated $350 million in renovation costs.
Advocates of a local presence say that a local wholesale hub would help keep struggling farms afloat while helping to satisfy the demand from New York institutions and grocery stores for fresh local food.
Andrew Rigie, an executive vice president of the New York State Restaurant Association, pointed out that more restaurants were promoting the freshness of their ingredients and local sourcing. Creating an attractive, convenient hub to buy those ingredients in bulk, he said, would give restaurants access to more quantity and variety of produce.
Other potential buyers, like Rhys W. Powell, president of Red Rabbit, a farm-fresh and organic food provider that serves about 10,000 meals a day in New York City schools, said that such an outlet would simplify his currently frenzied buying routine. ''It's like shopping at 12 different grocery stores,'' he said.
The 150 or so New York farmers selling through Hunts Point now, state agricultural experts said, are mostly large-scale growers of state staples like onions and apples that sell enough volume to absorb the 12 percent to 15 percent commissions set by the cooperative's wholesalers.
At the other end of the growing spectrum are small-scale farmers that can profitably sell directly to customers at retail farmers' markets like the one in Union Square.
But most upstate farmers fall into the middle, and they say they are falling through the cracks in the distribution system.
GrowNYC, the agency that runs a network of 57 retail green markets with 240 small-scale farmers, has proposed a $12 million center at or near the Hunts Point terminal. It would have indoor space providing refrigeration and storage for 80 farmers and space for complementary businesses like makers of local cheeses and preserves. The plan also envisions an outdoor site for an additional 50 farmers.
Marcel Van Ooyen, the agency's executive director, said that such a hub would allow farmers to set their own prices, sell directly to wholesale customers and keep more money in their pockets, just as the small farmers do. ''We think this is a huge game changer,'' he said.
Frank Dagele Jr., a fourth-generation farmer with Dagele Brothers Produce, 60 miles north of the city in the Orange County village of Florida, said his dream was to introduce his family's artichokes to the Hunts Point market. ''When people think of artichokes,'' he said with regret, ''they think of California.''
Mr. Dagele, 53, sells 5 percent of his 40 varieties of vegetables in the New York metropolitan area through various channels, including direct purchases by Whole Foods and sales to a Hunts Point wholesaler under the commission system. The bulk of his production goes to upstate supermarkets.
If he could sell directly from a year-round wholesale market, he said, he could plant an extra 50 acres on his farm, ramp up his fledgling greenhouse production and quadruple his sales in New York City.
The idea for the local hub has long been talked up by officials from the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets. More recently, it has drawn support from Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, who has said that her office is pushing for it, and from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, who last year outlined how it could benefit the upstate economy.
Whether the tight-knit cooperative of 38 companies at Hunts Point will ever agree to it remains unclear.
Mr. D'Arrigo, the co-op's president, said some members were worried about being outflanked by farmers with advantages like potential city subsidies and not being required to hire unionized labor. If the midsize farms are to sell there, he added, he would agree only to their selling outdoors.
But that would fall short of what advocates of local food have in mind.
''We call New York the restaurant capital of the world,'' Mr. Rigie said of the industry association, ''and we should have the most cutting-edge, accessible market in the world for local produce.''

HEADLINE: S.E.C. Asks If Hollywood Paid Bribes In China

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT, MICHAEL CIEPLY and BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
The Securities and Exchange Commission has begun an investigation into whether some of Hollywood's biggest movie studios have made illegal payments to officials in China to gain the right to film and show movies there, according to a person with knowledge of the investigation.
The inquiry creates a potential roadblock for the industry's plans to expand in one of the world's largest markets. 
The S.E.C. investigation has so far focused on at least three studios, the person said, but all of the largest and some smaller studios have been contacted or made aware of the inquiry, according to the person, who has direct knowledge of the investigation but who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the matter could end up in court.
In the last year, both the S.E.C. and the Justice Department have increased investigations under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, known as F.C.P.A., which forbids American companies from making illegal payments to government officials or others to ease the way for operations in foreign countries.
Government investigators have been particularly interested recently in the practices of United States companies in China, one of the largest potential markets and one that Hollywood executives have been particularly keen to enter.
An S.E.C. spokesman declined to comment on Tuesday.
The investigation was first reported on Tuesday by Reuters, which said that five companies had been contacted by the S.E.C., including 20th Century Fox, which is owned by News Corporation, the Walt Disney Company and DreamWorks Animation.
Officials at those companies declined to comment, as did a spokesman for the Marvel Entertainment unit of Disney, which recently said it would film part of ''Iron Man 3'' in China.
Spokesmen for the other major Hollywood studios, none of which are known to be under investigation, either declined to comment or did not respond to a request for comment.
Hollywood has been trying to get more films into the Chinese market for decades, but efforts have picked up in recent years in large part because China has identified cinema as a growth priority. China is racing to build more modern theaters to entertain an expanding, cinema-loving middle class. The country is also escalating local film production, partly as a way to spread its culture across the globe.
In February, Xi Jinping, China's vice president and likely future leader, visited politicians in Washington and movie executives in Hollywood. Soon after, China raised the number of foreign-produced films that can be shown there each year and increased the portion of box-office revenue from China that the movie studios get to keep.
Under the agreement, China agreed to allow 34 foreign-produced films to be shown annually, up from a quota of 20, as long as the additional films use either Imax or 3-D technologies. China also agreed to let studios keep about 25 percent of the box-office revenue; currently, Hollywood gets about 15 percent.
The discussions leading to the deal were conducted at a high level, as Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. joined Mr. Xi in personal negotiations. Given the level of diplomacy involved in reaching the agreement, the S.E.C. inquiry could be an embarrassment to the Obama administration.
Jeffrey Katzenberg, the DreamWorks Animation chief executive, and Robert A. Iger, Disney's chief executive, also helped forge the agreement.
China currently has about 6,000 movie screens, up from roughly 1,500 three years ago, according to studio distribution executives. The Chinese government has said it expects 20,000 screens to be operating by 2015 and 40,000 by 2040, bringing it on par with movie exhibition in North America.
Ticket revenue in China is expected to reach $5 billion by 2015, up from $2.1 billion last year, according to box office tracking companies.
Hollywood is facing a slowing movie market at home. Last year, attendance in North America dropped to its lowest level since 1993. Studios, contending with a dying DVD business, are more reliant than ever on showings in theaters and see China as a major antidote to their various economic problems.
All of that means that movie and entertainment deals in China have become a routine occurrence in Hollywood. DreamWorks Animation has announced plans to build, with a trio of Chinese partners, a $330 million offshoot studio called Oriental DreamWorks focused on family-friendly entertainment. Disney has its own partnership to develop and produce films and television shows; Disney is also building a major theme park in Shanghai.
Imax, the large-format film company, is teaming with China's largest theater operator, the Wanda Cinema Line Corporation, to spent $100 million to build 75 theaters by 2014. Imax currently has 45 theaters open in China, with an additional 57 in the works.
Even as they covet the Chinese market, however, executives and filmmakers in Hollywood have remained wary of Chinese censorship rules, which are so restrictive that most of the films being made and shown there are heavy on fantasies to avoid being perceived as commentaries on political affairs.
In an interview earlier this month, Peter A. Chernin, the chief executive of the Chernin Group, a media company that joined in producing ''Rise of the Planet of the Apes'' for Fox, said he was more inclined to deploy his own company's next investments in India or Indonesia. The chase for media investments in China had become ''overheated,'' he said, and heavy regulation has made China less attractive to him than other Asian markets.
Government officials have contended that American companies might be cutting corners to enter the growing Chinese market. As part of a reorganization at the S.E.C. over the last two years, the commission created a specialized investigative unit devoted to violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
The S.E.C.'s crackdown on foreign bribery grew to 20 cases in the year ended last September, up from 16 the previous year and 13 in 2009. The commission has brought seven cases so far in the current fiscal year.
Kara Brockmeyer, the chief of the S.E.C.'s Foreign Corrupt Practices Act unit, said in February that the commission had begun receiving better cooperation recently from financial regulators in other countries, noting that new antibribery laws had been passed in Russia and China.
Foreign bribery allegations have recently touched some of the largest companies doing business in the United States, including Aon, Siemens and Johnson & Johnson.

HEADLINE: Subsidize Students, Not Tax Cuts

 BODY:
In 2007, President George W. Bush signed a bill that cut in half interest rates on subsidized student loans until 2012. Those low rates will expire on July 1 -- going back to 6.8 percent from 3.4 percent -- and, to prevent college from becoming even more unaffordable for millions of students, the obvious move is to renew them. But nothing is that easy or sensible anymore in Washington, where House Republicans are far more interested in cutting taxes, largely for the rich, than they are in helping low- and middle-income students get a college education. 
House Republicans say the country cannot afford the $6 billion a year that it costs to pay for the lower rates. The Ryan budget, recently approved by the House, would allow the rates to double, and, at the same time, would cut taxes by $10 trillion over a decade. Representative John Kline Jr., the chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, said keeping the rates low would mean ''piling billions of dollars on the backs of taxpayers.''
Instead, Republicans would rather pile that burden on the backs of taxpayers-to-be, specifically the 7.4 million students who now have federally subsidized Stafford loans and the millions more who will need them. At a time when many graduates are desperate for jobs, the interest rate increase would add an average of $1,000 a year to their debt. Already, many Republican lawmakers around the country have made it clear that they don't even want students to vote, imposing identification requirements that would keep students away from polling places.
In the first of several speeches about the cost of higher education, President Obama urged students on Tuesday to demand that Congress renew the rates. ''At this make-or-break moment for the middle class,'' he said at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, ''we've got to make sure that you're not saddled with debt before you even get started in life.''
Nothing is more important to this country's future than ensuring a good education for coming generations. The issue also plays directly into Mr. Obama's own need to re-energize younger voters, who turned out in overwhelming numbers for him in 2008 but seem far less enthusiastic these days.
Once the White House began its effort, Mitt Romney broke with House Republicans and said Monday that he supports renewing the loan subsidies. As usual, though, that also meant breaking with himself, since he had fully embraced the House budget and never expressed any reservations about the student loan provisions. Indeed, only a few months ago, he argued repeatedly in interviews that student subsidies were a bad idea that encouraged colleges to raise their tuition.
Mr. Romney, along with the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, said that the $6 billion cost of the subsidy should be offset with cuts to other programs, but predictably neither man said where those cuts should come from. The White House and Democrats have proposed raising the money by ending a loophole used by high-paid employees of S-corporations to avoid paying full payroll taxes.
The Republican response to that idea is also predictable. This is a party that shows time and again that it wants to protect only those who have made it, not help those struggling to get started.

HEADLINE: Changes in Europe Could Help Google In Antitrust Case

BYLINE: By JAMES KANTER

 BODY:
BRUSSELS -- For the past two years, Google has worked hard to avoid facing formal antitrust charges in Europe that could mean years of expensive litigation and encourage the authorities in other parts of the world to take comparable action.
Time is running out. The European Commission could bring charges against the U.S. company for abusing its dominance in the search and advertising market in the next few weeks.
But there remains hope for a deal that would spare Google the arduous court orders and huge fines once imposed on Microsoft, another U.S. technology titan that ran afoul of European competition laws more than a decade ago.
That hope is the result, at least in part, of a changed environment in Brussels. The bitter fight with Microsoft taught regulators that long-running cases, even if won, may not result in effective remedies in the fast-moving technology sector. 
Perhaps more important has been the role played by Joaquin Almunia, a Spanish politician who took over as the European Union's competition commissioner just as the investigation into Google was getting under way.
Mr. Almunia has been a low-key figure compared with his predecessor, Neelie Kroes, who earned the nickname ''Steely Neelie'' for the apparent relish with which she wielded her considerable power in antitrust cases. Mr. Almunia has gained a reputation for attempting to reach settlements, where possible, rather than trying to win scalps.
Mr. Almunia, who took office in 2010, has said that the challenge in antitrust cases ''is to intervene in a timely fashion, before it's too late.''
''One trend that is emerging from a growing number of antitrust cases is our search for effective -- and sometimes structural -- commitments when they would more efficiently prevent competition concerns in the longer term,'' he said at a conference in St. Gallen, Switzerland, last year.
In his brief tenure, Mr. Almunia has successfully concluded cases with International Business Machines, Standard & Poor's and Apple. The cases lasted no more than two years or so. Of those three cases, only the S.&P. case was not settled before formal charges were filed. By comparison, the cases against Microsoft lasted more than a decade and spanned the tenure of two of Mr. Almunia's predecessors.
But far from weakening enforcement of antitrust regulations, settlements show the formidable power that European investigators have over companies. Unlike their counterparts in the United States, antitrust regulators in Europe can impose penalties without first winning a court order. A company can appeal to a court but usually must comply in the interim.
Trevor Soames, a partner at the Brussels office of Shearman & Sterling, a law firm, said judges were perceived as giving ''unjustified deference'' to decisions by the European Commission, and so many companies avoid fighting cases. The result is that companies ''enter into settlements that they shouldn't, as the case against them is weak,'' said Mr. Soames, who has represented Microsoft and Qualcomm in antitrust cases.
Without a settlement, Google would leave itself open to being fined as much as 10 percent of its annual worldwide revenue, which reached nearly $38 billion last year, and conform to any E.U. law it was found to violate before being allowed to appeal to the General Court of the European Union.
Google and Mr. Almunia have repeatedly left the door open for negotiations.
More than a year ago, at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Mr. Almunia assured Eric E. Schmidt, then Google's chief executive, that he would give the company a chance to offer a solution without incurring a penalty.
This year, again in Davos, Mr. Almunia met with David C. Drummond, the chief legal officer of Google. At that meeting, Mr. Drummond suggested that the Google case provided an opportunity to change the model of European antitrust inquiries to resolve cases more rapidly, according to people with knowledge of the discussion who spoke on condition of anonymity because it had been private.
The two men also discussed the desirability of addressing any concerns about Google's business practices without going through all of the steps in previous cases, these people said.
''Our size and success rightly generate scrutiny, which is why we've worked hard to explain how our business works, cooperating with the European Commission since this investigation began,'' said Al Verney, a Google spokesman. ''Because there's always room for improvement, we're happy to discuss any concerns the commission might have.''
During its battles in Europe, Microsoft was able to continue consolidating its command over some aspects of desktop and server software before it finally consented to change some of its business practices. Microsoft also eventually paid fines totaling 1.7 billion, or more than $2 billion at the time, but those sums went to the Union's budget rather than to competitors or to consumers that might have been harmed by its practices.
In another lengthy case against a U.S. technology giant, Intel was fined 1.1 billion, the largest single fine levied by the European antitrust authorities, by Ms. Kroes in 2009 for abusing its dominance in the computer chip market.
Intel has appealed that ruling, saying the commission did not follow procedure. A four-day hearing is scheduled for July, and a judgment could come late this year. Any finding against the commission could limit its scope for extracting settlements in the future.
In the case of Google, Mr. Almunia suggested last year that his approach would be ''a good example that timely intervention is crucial in fast-moving technology markets, which often feature network and lock-in effects.''
Last month he said he would review the findings by his case team some time after Easter, which was April 8. But there are factors that may delay any presentation of charges, known as a statement of objections.
One is the complexity of the case. With at least 14 complaints from sectors including publishing, advertising, mapping and search under consideration, the ''Google case is already bloated compared to cases like Microsoft and Intel,'' said Nicolas Petit, a law professor at the University of Liege in Belgium. ''If Mr. Almunia sends formal charges anytime soon,'' he said, ''I believe he will be seeking to channel the investigation toward a narrower set of allegations and will be hoping to quiet down the clamoring for action by all of the complainants.''
In an important respect, Google's strength is a more sensitive issue in Europe than in the United States, where its share of online searches is about 67 percent, according to comScore, a research company.
In Germany, France, Italy, Spain and Britain, Google's share of online searches rose to 94.3 percent in February from 92.1 percent when Mr. Almunia started his investigation, comScore said. The next closest competitor is Microsoft's Bing, with a share of about 2 percent.
Mr. Almunia also may be seeking to align the European investigation with an inquiry by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission that began a few months later.
Last month, speaking in Washington, Mr. Almunia called the relationship between Europe and the United States ''the bedrock on which global competition enforcement will be based.''
That relationship is especially important in the case of Google, experts said.
''The Google case is hugely important to the technology industry, and the danger is that if more mature agencies in the West fail to sing from the same hymn sheet, then there's a risk that the younger agencies will feel entitled to regulate in conflicting ways,'' said William E. Kovacic, a former F.T.C. commissioner and a law professor at George Washington University in Washington.
''I'd expect the Europeans and Americans to be talking about Google as much as they can, perhaps even on the timing of any decisions they take,'' he said.
Google also has strongly hinted that Microsoft, which is an official complainant in the case, would be one of the main beneficiaries of any legal action that bogged it down in Europe.
That may be yet another reason for caution for Mr. Almunia, whose department has long been accused of relying too much in its investigations on outside complaints from companies, rather than gathering evidence of actual harm to consumers.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Letter From Georgetown: A Jesuit Rebuke for Ryan

BYLINE: By LAURIE GOODSTEIN

 BODY:
Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee, has been excoriated by some Roman Catholic leaders ever since he claimed this month that his budget plan, which slashes antipoverty programs, was inspired by the moral teachings of his Catholic faith.
The latest criticism comes in a letter released Tuesday and signed by nearly 90 faculty members and priests at Georgetown, the Jesuit university in Washington, in advance of Mr. Ryan's visit there on Thursday. Mr. Ryan is to deliver the prestigious Whittington Lecture, named for an associate dean who was killed on the airplane that crashed into the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001. 
The letter says, ''We would be remiss in our duty to you and our students if we did not challenge your continuing misuse of Catholic teaching to defend a budget plan that decimates food programs for struggling families, radically weakens protections for the elderly and sick, and gives more tax breaks to the wealthiest few.''
''Your budget appears to reflect the values of your favorite philosopher, Ayn Rand, rather than the Gospel of Jesus Christ,'' says the letter, which the faculty members sent to Mr. Ryan along with a copy of the Vatican's Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church -- ''to help deepen your understanding of Catholic social teaching.''
The pressure on Mr. Ryan is part of an effort by some Catholic leaders who are political independents, liberals and Democrats to make it clear that the Catholic church is not an arm of the Republican Party. In the last year, Catholic bishops have emerged as vocal critics of the Obama administration over what they regard as violations of religious freedom, in particular the mandate that even religious employers must provide health insurance that covers birth control.
Their condemnation has grown so heated that this month, Bishop Daniel Jenky, of Peoria, Ill., said in a homily that President Obama was so intolerant of religion that he was ''following a similar path'' as Hitler and Stalin. Dozens of faculty members at Notre Dame, also a Catholic university, sent a letter to the president and chairman of the board of trustees last Friday asking them to rebuke Bishop Jenky's comments and seek his resignation from the board. Bishop Jenky has stood by his comments.
The budget authored by Mr. Ryan, a rising star among conservatives, has given Catholic leaders an opportunity to distance the church from the Republican Party. In an interview this month on the Christian Broadcasting Network, Mr. Ryan claimed that his budget was consistent with Catholic moral teaching because it pushes the poor to become independent of government assistance.
''The preferential option for the poor, which is one of the primary tenants of Catholic social teaching, means don't keep people poor, don't make people dependent on government so that they stay stuck at their station in life, help people get out of poverty out onto life of independence,'' he said.
The letter released Tuesday by the faculty at Georgetown took Mr. Ryan to task for that argument, saying that Catholic teaching calls for government to step in and help when communities ''face problems beyond their means to address, such as economic crises, high unemployment, endemic poverty and hunger.''
The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops has also issued several letters to members of Congress calling for a budget that prioritizes aid to the poor. Mr. Ryan claimed in a recent interview that those letters did not speak for all bishops, but the conference responded that those letters do indeed represent the bishops' collective opinion.

HEADLINE: With 5 More Victories, Romney's Focus Is Fall

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER and JEFF ZELENY; Ashley Parker reported from Manchester, and Jeff Zeleny from Washington. Jennifer Steinhauer contributed reporting from Washington.

 BODY:
MANCHESTER, N.H. -- Mitt Romney effectively assumed the helm of the Republican Party on Tuesday after five primary victories across the Northeast solidified his stature as the presidential nominee-in-waiting who is trying to unite conservatives and persuade independent voters that President Obama does not deserve a second term.
As Mr. Romney received a significant boost in delegates from New York, Pennsylvania, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware, moving closer to the total needed to formally secure the nomination, he marked the milestone by outlining themes of the fall campaign in a visit to this battleground state. 
''Americans have always been eternal optimists,'' Mr. Romney said during a speech to supporters here. ''Over the last three and a half years, we have seen hopes and dreams diminished by false promises and weak leadership. Everywhere I go, Americans are tired of being tired.''
Mr. Romney, who fought back challenges from a Republican field that once included nearly a dozen rivals, has been shifting his campaign toward the general election since Rick Santorum left the race two weeks ago. But as Newt Gingrich indicated a new willingness to reassess his candidacy after his defeat in Delaware, a primary he considered crucial, the formal end to the race finally seemed at hand, giving Mr. Romney latitude to assert control over the Republican National Committee and concentrate on how to confront Mr. Obama.
The Romney campaign, which has been expanding rapidly, is settling on a message for the fall campaign. Mr. Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, laid out a succinct argument for his economic leadership and urged Americans to consider whether they are better off now than when Mr. Obama took office three years ago.
''President Obama is not going to run on his record, but we are,'' said Ed Gillespie, a senior adviser to the Romney campaign. He said Mr. Romney would detail his economic vision as he prepared to challenge Mr. Obama, declaring, ''It's not just about the last three years, but the future.''
More than 200 delegates were at stake on Tuesday. With the outcome of the nominating contest no longer in doubt, Mr. Romney barely campaigned in the states, but he was expected to win the lion's share of the delegates and accelerate his effort to reach the 1,144 required for the nomination.
''Is it easier to make ends meet? Is it easier to sell your home or buy a new one?'' Mr. Romney asked, ticking through a litany of challenges facing Americans. He added, ''If the answer were yes to those questions, then President Obama would be running for re-election based on his achievements and rightly so, but because he has failed, he will run a campaign of diversions and distractions and distortions.''
Although Mr. Romney often talks about how he and the president offer competing visions of the country's future, he will try to turn the focus to a contrast between his vision and Mr. Obama's record. The campaign will mine details of the president's actions in office, particularly his stewardship of the economy.
Mr. Romney will also begin introducing himself to a wider audience of voters who have yet to focus on the general election. In addition to having him talk about his background and business experience, the campaign will increase the presence of his wife, Ann, and five sons on the trail. On Monday night, Mrs. Romney headlined a Republican dinner in Stamford, Conn., choking up when she talked about how her husband stood by her side when she was found to have multiple sclerosis.
The Republican primary campaign, which was defined by the acrimony among Mr. Romney, Mr. Santorum and their rivals over the party's direction, is drawing to a close in an anticlimactic fashion. Some Republicans have done little to mask their tepid response to Mr. Romney, but several party leaders said Tuesday that they did not worry about getting conservatives to rally behind him.
''It's Obama that's going to get Republicans jazzed up,'' said Senator Jim DeMint of South Carolina, who has expressed support for Mr. Romney. ''As he gets his positions across and shows the contrast with where Obama's taken the country and where he wants to take us, people will clearly see what he is talking about.''
As Mr. Romney attends fund-raisers in New York and New Jersey on Wednesday, many of his top aides will gather in Boston for what one adviser described as a day of ''serious meetings'' to discuss building his campaign into a general election operation ready to take on Mr. Obama. Already, the Romney campaign has started creating a ''cubicle village'' in the now-empty first floor of its headquarters to accommodate all of its new hires.
One campaign challenge will be keeping Mr. Romney in the spotlight, particularly as he competes with the White House for attention. To that end, his campaign manager, Matt Rhoades, is devising a rollout calendar with the intent of introducing national endorsements (former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York on Monday) or big-name campaigners (Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who spent Monday with Mr. Romney in Pennsylvania) almost daily.
The Romney campaign is aggressively looking into all aspects of the Obama administration, with a plan to present the president as a nice and likable but unsuited to solving the country's economic challenges. Aides said they intended to keep the conversation focused on Mr. Obama's record in the White House and not his personal biography.
''There is a pretty broad view that President Obama is a good family man and decent guy, but may be in over his head,'' said Mr. Gillespie, a former counselor to George W. Bush, who was brought into the Romney campaign this month. He said the argument against re-election would be built around the suggestion that Mr. Obama ''has not displayed strong leadership, but failed leadership and weak leadership.''
Mr. Obama offered his take on Mr. Romney during a taping on Tuesday of ''Late Night With Jimmy Fallon,'' saying: ''I've met him, but we're not friends.''

HEADLINE: Warmth of Campus Spotlight Beckons Obama Back

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER; Reporting was contributed by Dan Frosch from Boulder, Paul Cuadros from Chapel Hill, N.C., and Joe Doakes and Jennifer Steinhauer from Washington.

 BODY:
BOULDER, Colo. -- The arenas are rocking, the students are whooping and President Obama is feeling the love.
''I love you back, I really do!'' he calls out to thousands of young people packed to the rafters. When one shouts, ''We believe in you!'' he yells back, ''I believe in you!'' When he emphasizes a point, he calls out, ''Can I get an amen?''
For a president facing a tough re-election and a stubborn economy, there is no better amen corner, no more invigorating audience, than on campus. For a few exuberant moments, it can feel like 2008 all over again, when the youth vote actually showed up and helped propel an unlikely outsider to the White House. 
But the cheers Mr. Obama heard on Tuesday as he opened a two-day, three-college swing masked a more daunting reality as he seeks to mobilize young voters to his side once again. Mr. Obama is no longer the avatar of promise and possibility; he is the incumbent presiding over an anemic job market awaiting future graduates. He is a figure of compromised ideals asking for forbearance as he seeks to live up to the sky-high expectations he inspired the first time around.
''It's definitely not the same as it was in 2008,'' said Ariana van den Akker, a 22-year-old senior at the University of North Carolina, the president's first stop on Tuesday. ''You saw it a lot more on campus then. I feel like the reality of the economy has set in. If you look at the pictures of when he visited in 2008, when he was looking at the Democratic bid, I think a lot more people were excited then than now.''
College students face an intimidating job market. Nearly 54 percent of graduates under 25 years old last year were unemployed or underemployed. ''They bought into the message of hope and change four years ago; now they think it's time for something new,'' said Beaumont Allen, a spokesman for a Republican youth group called Concord 51.
That does not mean that young people are shifting in large numbers to Mr. Romney. A new Web-based survey by Knowledge Networks for Harvard University's Institute on Politics found that Mr. Obama leads Mr. Romney 43 percent to 26 percent among those 18 to 29 years old, six points higher than last winter.
But surveys and interviews suggest that enthusiasm for the president has waned, and his challenge will be rousing young people to actually turn out. Among 18- to 34-year-olds surveyed by land line and cellphone by NBC News and The Wall Street Journal, 45 percent expressed high interest in the election, compared with 63 percent in April 2008.
That remains critical in swing states like those Mr. Obama visits this week, North Carolina, Colorado and Iowa. In such states, the Obama campaign has recruited students as volunteers with the possibility of becoming paid field organizers as it focuses on 15 million people, 6 million of whom are registered, who were not old enough to vote last time.
The policy focus of Mr. Obama's swing -- termed an official trip, financed by taxpayers -- is the cost of federally subsidized student loans. Interest rates for 7 million students are set to double to 6.8 percent on July 1, and the president has called on Congress to prevent that. It was an issue stoked by Democrats to put Mr. Romney on the defensive.
Mr. Romney tried to defuse the issue on Monday by supporting an extension of the interest rates because of ''the extraordinarily poor conditions in the job market'' under Mr. Obama.
Democrats said Mr. Romney's position contradicted his support for the budget by Representative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, and his previously expressed skepticism about ''taxpayers having to subsidize people who want to go to school.''
Without naming Mr. Romney, Mr. Obama mocked his statement. ''Everybody will give lip service to this,'' he said. ''You'll hear a lot of folks say, 'Yes, education is important -- it's important.' But it requires not just words but deeds.''
Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, plans to introduce a bill on the interest rates, and Democrats said it would offset its cost by preventing some individuals from paying taxes as corporations.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said Mr. Obama was trying to distract from economic policies that had made it harder to find jobs. ''I'm sure he'll give a very rousing speech, full of straw men and villains who stand in the way of their dreams,'' Mr. McConnell said. ''I'm sure he'll also express his strong support for things that all of us agree on. But what he won't talk about is the extent to which the decisions he's made are limiting their opportunities in the years ahead.''
Some students were willing to give Mr. Obama the benefit of the doubt. Alex Zaczek, 26, a junior at the University of Colorado, Boulder, who volunteered for Mr. Obama in 2008, credited him for affordable loans.
Taia Butler, a freshman, said many students were excited by Mr. Romney because he was wealthy and unlikely to be corrupted. But she said women's rights would determine her vote.
Still, dismal job prospects hung over the campuses. ''It's just so scary to hear my classmates who are so smart having trouble finding a job,'' said Becky Bush, 20, a junior at North Carolina. ''Whether it's the president's fault they can't find a job, I don't know. I do know he's making a conscious effort to fix that.''

HEADLINE: Study Points to Roles for Industry and Organics in Agriculture

BYLINE: ANDREW C. REVKIN


HIGHLIGHT: A new analysis finds higher yields from industrial-style agriculture, but a role for organic farming in certain circumstances. 

 BODY:
A paper in this week's issue of Nature reinforces the argument that a hybrid path in agriculture -- incorporating both industrial-style production and organic practices where they make sense -- gives the best chance of feeding some 9 billion people by midcentury with the fewest regrets. 
The paper, "Comparing the yields of organic and conventional agriculture," is by a doctoral student, Verena Seufert, and the geography professor Navin Ramankutty, both of McGill University, and Jonathan Foley, the director of the Institute on the Environment of the University of Minnesota. They found that, over all, conventional farming methods produced 25 percent higher yields than organic techniques, but organic came close for certain crops in certain soils. The authors' core conclusion? 
[T]here are no simple ways to determine a clear 'winner' for all possible farming situations. However, instead of continuing the ideologically charged 'organic versus conventional' debate, we should systematically evaluate the costs and benefits of different management options. In the end, to achieve sustainable food security we will probably need many different techniques - including organic, conventional, and possible 'hybrid' systems - to produce more food at affordable prices, ensure livelihoods for farmers, and reduce the environmental costs of agriculture....
To establish organic agriculture as an important tool in sustainable food production, the factors limiting organic yields need to be more fully understood, alongside assessments of the many social, environmental and economic benefits of organic farming systems.
I caught up with Foley by e-mail, saying that the paper appeared to paint a picture in which cereals, particularly, benefit from fertilizer and the other inputs favored in large-scale farming, while specialty crops can offer smaller farming operations sustainable levels of income. Here's his reaction:
 We really need new "hybrid" approaches, taking the best of the conventional and organic paradigms, and deploying them when and where they make the most sense. 
In this study we found that organic systems can compete very well with conventional farms when it comes to fruits and many kinds of vegetables. And they do very well (understandably) with legumes. That's the good news for organic farming.
Where organic has a lot of ground to make up is in the major grains, especially staples like wheat and rice. There we found that organic farms have significantly lower yields than their conventional counterparts.. And since most of the world's bulk calories come from these cereals, this is a really big deal. Organic practices, as we know them today, just cannot produce the same volume of grain calories that conventional farms do on the same land base. That assumes, of course, that our goal is to grow calories -- which is only one measure of food production and only one aspect of food security.
The bottom line? Today's organic farming practices are probably best deployed in fruit and vegetable farms, where growing nutrition (not just bulk calories) is the primary goal. But for delivering sheer calories, especially in our staple crops of wheat, rice, maize, soybeans and so on, conventional farms have the advantage right now.
Looking forward, I think we will need to deploy different kinds of practices (especially new, mixed approaches that take the best of organic and conventional farming systems) where they are best suited -- geographically, economically, socially, etc.

HEADLINE: Surpassing the Great American Consumer

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: Upwardly mobile consumers from much poorer countries are about to displace Americans in their share of the world economy. 

 BODY:
Once upon a time, the world vied primarily for the attention (and dollars) of American consumers. Just a decade ago, they were responsible for nearly a quarter of the world's economy.
Now, however, Americans on their way to being displaced by upwardly mobile consumers from much poorer countries.
The chart above, created by economists at IHS Global Insight, shows the share of the world's gross domestic product that is contributed by personal spending in various countries. The blue line represents American consumers, and shows that in percentage terms, their share of the world's domestic product has fallen significantly in the last decade.
That is partly because American spending had been artificially inflated by the credit bubble. When the credit bubble burst, consumers retrenched and their spending plunged. Consumer spending returned to its prerecession peak only in the last quarter of 2010.

The other major factor is that living standards in the developing world are improving so quickly that these countries are now driving global economic growth.
The green line in the chart above shows consumer spending in four important emerging market economies: Brazil, Russia, India and China. Collectively these are known as the "BRICs."
As you can see, the green and blue lines have been steadily converging. That indicates that residents of these emerging markets are contributing almost as much to the global economy as Americans are.
Would being surpassed by the BRIC consumers be a bad thing for Americans? Not necessarily. More and richer shoppers in places like India and China mean growing market opportunities for American companies. In fact, economists have been saying for years that the American economy is too dependent on its own consumers and should work toward increasing its exports to customers abroad.
But to the extent that American companies decide to move their high-paying, high-skilled jobs closer to their new customer base - for example, by building R.&D. centers in China, following the lead of Microsoft,General Motors,Caterpillar,Avon,Merckand DuPont - the waning influence of American consumers could be considered more concerning.

HEADLINE: What is the Ministry of Health Trying to Tell Doctors?

BYLINE: SRUTHI GOTTIPATI


HIGHLIGHT: Deciphering the message behind recent reports that Indian doctors studying overseas will be forced to return home. 

 BODY:
A top government minister, Ghulam Nabi Azad, this week delivered a jolt to India's aspiring doctors that became front-page news on Tuesday: Any student wishing to continue their medical education in the United States would now have to sign a "bond" binding them to return to India once their studies were completed. Why? Mr. Azad said the tougher regulation was linked to a change in United States policy. 
Yet for those happy with the status quo, there's good news.
It's not true.
"There's no bond," said Sanjay Prasad, an official from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, who's familiar with the situation.
The U.S. also hasn't made any new demands for enrollment in American programs, a spokesperson from the U.S State Department said.
So, what's all the fuss about?
Turns out, the U.S. government has always required some certificates from the Indian health ministry to issue a visa to Indian doctors who want to go to medical school in the United States. To fulfill this requirement, and receive the necessary certificates, Indians students in the past had to provide a "written assurance" to the ministry that after completing their medical studies, they would return to India to practice. But now, the Indian government is requiring these students to sign an affidavit promising to return to India in order to get those same certificates. The affidavit appears to have more weight than the written assurance -- Mr. Prasad says it can be "legally enforced." 
But whether the Indian government will ask the U.S. government to deny doctors permission to work in the country, as the health and family minister, Ghulam Nabi Azad, reportedly said, remains to be seen.
The Indian government's new affidavit appears unlikely to immediately affect the number of Indian doctors rushing to immigrate to the U.S. -- the world's top destination for doctors. But it does draw into focus an ethical, and often heated, debate about "brain drain."
Mr. Azad's announcement Monday appears to be an arm-twisting approach by the government to keep doctors in India that is more reminiscent of the socialist ethos India had in the past than the ideals it embraced with liberalization in 1991.
How is the U.S. able to suck up the world's medical talent
For starters, physicians practicing primary care in the U.S. made a median annual salary of $202,392 in 2010, according to the Medical Group Management Association. Those in medical specialties averaged $356,885. Compare that to the salary range of $2,300 to $32,300 in India.
America is also on the cutting edge of the medical profession and offers opportunities to doctors that India simply can't. Moreover, the failings of the education system in India and the poor working conditions in public hospitals make a shift to America more enticing.
But measures to curb a brain drain have found some support because of the pressing health challenges India faces combined with the dearth of health care professionals in the country. India has a dismal ratio of one doctor for 1,676 people, according to the World Health Organization as compared to the one doctor per 1,000 people recommended by WHO.
Critics of the brain drain also point out that in India, the government often subsidizes the education and provides resources for those doctors the country loses to emigration. 
A widely reported study by a doctor at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences or A.I.I.M.S, the pre-eminent public hospital, found that A.I.I.M.S spends at least $60,000 a year on every undergraduate student studying medicine there. The student pays an annual fee of $16 for tuition, room and board.
"I'm of the considered opinion that we should allow some sort of bond system where maybe after five years working there, doctors should come back," said Dr. Shakti Gupta, who authored the A.I.I.M.S study, noting that doctors should pay compensation if they don't return. Dr. Gupta said it's not just doctors who are headed abroad: about 500 nurses from their 3,500 nursing staff at A.I.I.M.S head to foreign shores every year. 
According to another 2006 study, more than half of students who graduated from A.I.I.M.S. went abroad.
But the "brain drain" argument has been countered by proponents who say that India is the recipient of robust remissions from those very same doctors who migrated abroad. Moreover, the concept of a "brain drain" has shifted to a global "brain circulation" where immigrants, and the skills they acquire abroad, and what they might be able to offer their native countries, are viewed favorably.
A spokesperson for the MCI said he couldn't comment for this story.
An earlier version of this post incorrectly said that the Indian government's crackdown could deter Indian students from going to medical school in the United States, because of the high cost of education there. The affidavit only applies to post-graduate students who are typically attending their residencies in the United States, which are paid positions.

HEADLINE: Watson to Buy Actavis for $5.9 Billion

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Watson Pharmaceuticals agreed on Wednesday to buy the Swiss drug maker Actavis Group for up to 4.5 billion euros ($5.9 billion), as the American company looked to expand its presence in overseas markets. 

 BODY:
LONDON - Watson Pharmaceuticals agreed on Wednesday to buy the Swiss drug maker Actavis Group for as much as 4.5 billion euros ($5.9 billion), as the American company looks to expand its presence in overseas markets.
The deal, which would create one of the world's largest generic drug manufacturers, represents the latest in a series of pharmaceutical deals this month. SXC Health Solutions agreed to buy Catalyst Health Solutions for $4.4 billion, while the British drug maker GlaxoSmithKline made an unsolicited $2.59 billion offer for Human Genome Sciences.
Under the terms of the deal, Watson, based in Parsippany, N.J., will pay 4.25 billion euros up front for Actavis, a Swiss manufacturer of generic drugs that has operations in more than 40 countries. Watson will pay an additional 250 million euros dependent on Actavis meeting certain profit goals for the year, according to a joint statement from the companies.
The acquisition would help strengthen Watson's presence outside the United States. Both companies have American operations, but the Swiss company has a larger stake in the generic drug industry outside the United States, particularly in Europe. Watson said the acquisition should boost international sales of generic drugs to 40 percent of the total, up from 16 percent now. 
"The acquisition of Actavis will create the third largest global generics company, substantially completing Watson's expansion as a leading global generics company," Paul M. Bisaro, C.E.O. of Watson, said in a statement. "Actavis dramatically enhances our commercial position on a global basis and brings complementary products and capabilities in the United States."
Watson's acquisition of Actavis comes as American companies are looking for deals in Europe, which continues to struggle from a debt crisis. American acquisitions on the Continent, including the deal for Actavis, total $39 billion this year, a 39 percent increase over the same period in 2011, according to the data provider S&P Capital IQ. The largest deal was United Parcel Service's $6.8 billion acquisition of the Dutch shipping company TNT Express, which was announced last month.
The sale will offer some relief for Deutsche Bank, which is Actavis's largest creditor after financing a $5 billion leveraged buyout of Actavis by the Icelandic billionaire Bjorgolfur Thor Bjorgolfsson in 2007. Over the last five years, Actavis has been burdened by the high cost of its debt. Deutsche Bank took a charge of 407 million euros related to Actavis during the last three months of 2011.
Watson's takeover of Actavis is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2012. 
Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch and Latham & Watkins are advising Watson, while Blackstone Advisory Partners and Deutsche Bank are working with Actavis.

HEADLINE: Hedge Fund Managers See Tough Year for Industry

BYLINE: JANET MORRISSEY


HIGHLIGHT: A study of 400 hedge fund managers found about half believed that 2012 would be "a difficult or somewhat difficult" year for the industry, partly because of new regulations and cutthroat competition. 

 BODY:
Hedge fund managers are predicting a tough year for the sector in 2012.
A report by the consulting firm Rothstein Kass found about half of the 400 hedge fund managers who responded believed that 2012 would be a "a difficult or somewhat difficult" year for the industry. Almost 40 percent expressed concerns that the United States would enter a double-dip recession. Only about 32 percent of those who responded in 2011 thought it would be a rough year for hedge funds. 
Political and economic uncertainty, tougher requirements by the Securities and Exchange Commission and brutal competition for investment dollars are among the challenges facing the industry in 2012, said Howard Altman, co-chief executive of the Financial Services Group at Rothstein Kass. "Less people are optimistic; they're thinking about the economy, the way the markets have behaved post-crisis, and the regulatory environment that's facing them," he said.
 E-mails were sent to hedge fund managers identified through industry databases to participate in the study. The 400 managers who responded represent 771 hedge fund vehicles, Rothstein Kass said.
"A lot of larger funds will fail to meet the performance expectation of their investors, which may dampen overall investor interest in hedge funds," predicted one respondent in the 20-page report. "Many funds had negative returns in 2011 despite a flat stock market - the pressure is really on in 2012!"
About one third of those who replied indicated that they did not plan to use leverage when making investments in 2012 while about 52 percent planned to use less than 2-to-1 leverage this year. Mr. Altman said that trend was surprising.
"This business has always had higher leverage in its moniker," he said. The decrease in leverage likely reflects demands made by investment banks and other lenders in this economic environment and tougher regulatory requirements.
Still, 66 percent plan to raise assets by at least 25 percent in 2012. 
Raising capital in this cutthroat era is among the toughest challenges facing the sector this year: The study found 79 percent believe seeding was critical to a successful fund start, and almost 43 percent indicated they would be willing to lower fees in exchange for early-stage or seed capital. 
"Capital has been going to the very large funds," which makes it tougher for funds with less than $1 billion under management, Mr. Altman said. "Capital raising is a very large challenge." He expects industry consolidation will play a role in the industry.
Meeting new S.E.C. requirements is also a major concern for hedge funds. About 52 percent expressed concerns about the scope and frequency of reporting requirements under new regulatory rules, and about 43 percent worried about having the staff and resources needed to comply with the new reporting requirements. 
The report also found that women- and minority-owned companies were still a small segment of the industry. About 6 percent of the respondents said that their firms were owned or managed predominantly by women, while 10 percent reported that they were predominantly owned or managed by minorities.

HEADLINE: Banks Form Alliances to Buy A.I.G. Assets

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Barclays and Deutsche Bank formed the latest partnership to bid for Maiden Lane III assets, following similar alliances struck this week among other titans of finance. 

 BODY:
Big banks, gearing up for a bidding war on assets tied to the collapse of the American International Group, have created unlikely alliances to mount offers for what was once viewed as the dregs of Wall Street. 
Barclays and Deutsche Bank formed the latest partnership on Wednesday, according to a letter to investors obtained by DealBook, following similar deals struck this week among other titans of finance. Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Credit Suisse were the first to team up, while Bank of America recently formed a union with Morgan Stanley. Nomura, the Japanese firm, also joined forces with Bank of America on Wednesday. 
At the height of the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York created a special entity, known as Maiden Lane III, to take on nearly $30 billion in assets from Wall Street banks. The banks, including some of the same institutions that are now bidding, had bought insurance on the assets from A.I.G. But the insurer could not post sufficient collateral to honor the policies as it struggled to survive. 
As Maiden Lane III came to the rescue, saving the banks from major losses on the securities known as collateralized debt obligations, the move was seen as a backdoor bailout of Wall Street. 
On Thursday, the New York Fed will auction the so-called MAX C.D.O., a package of commercial real estate securities, to the highest bidder. It is the latest effort to whittle down the bailout of A.I.G., which received a $182 billion federal lifeline to stay afloat.
The alliance of Barclays and Deutsche Bank could have the upper hand. Barclays, the big British bank, is already party to a contract tied to the MAX C.D.O. The contract would have to be unwound if the winning bidder decided to chop up the C.D.O. and sell its various parts to investors. Deutsche Bank, meanwhile, owns slices of the C.D.O. 
Until the auction begins Thursday morning, Barclays and Deutsche Bank are soliciting bids of their own from investors who are interested in buying the underlying securities. The investors have until 8 a.m. to file their bids with either Barclays or Deutsche Bank.
BlackRock Solutions, an arm of the giant asset manager, will then conduct the bidding process with all the banks. Ultimately, the New York Fed will decide what securities, if any, to sell. The determination, the New York Fed said, will depend on the "strength of the best bid."
The auction is connected to a broader effort to unwind the insurer's lifeline from the government, which still holds a roughly 70 percent stake in the company. The Treasury Department, for instance, recently sold $6 billion worth of A.I.G. stock and the insurer repaid $8.5 billion in other obligations to the government.

HEADLINE: Did Blankfein Snub Paulson?

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: In television appearances on Wednesday, Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, claimed that "my predecessors didn't go to China." That would be news to Henry M. Paulson Jr. 

 BODY:
On Wednesday morning on CNBC, Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief of Goldman Sachs, made a rare on-camera appearance to defend the embattled firm from its detractors.
But he may have inadvertently snubbed another Goldman legend - Henry M. Paulson, Jr. - in the process. 
Asked by Bloomberg TV what the future held for Goldman, Mr. Blankfein replied, "To refer back to the rise of the emerging markets and wealth creation around the world, my predecessors didn't go to China. They called it Red China. They didn't go to Russia or India because there were people in poverty, not people growing their businesses and trading with the rest of the world to the extent they are."
 On CNBC minutes earlier, Mr. Blankfein also mentioned China, saying: "My predecessors didn't go to China three or four times a year like I do."
We'd imagine that Mr. Paulson, if he tuned in to Mr. Blankfein's interviews, was scratching his head.
Mr. Paulson, of course, is the former Goldman chief and Treasury secretary who was famous for engineering Goldman's push into China. Back in 2006, Mr. Paulson told The Wall Street Journal about his focus there:
I've been to China about 70 times since the end of 1990. I just got back from the Middle East. There are huge amounts of capital in that region. They have much more capital than investing opportunities. So there are real opportunities there.
Indeed, Mr. Paulson is among the Goldman alumni with the closest ties to China. A 2006 profile in BusinessWeek described the depth of his knowledge about the country:
Paulson does have plenty of guanxi, or connections, thanks to years of building up street cred with Beijing's power elite. He traveled extensively to China during the 1990s on behalf of Goldman, has served as advisor to the Tsinghua University's School of Economics and Management, and engaged in environmental projects in China's Southwestern Yunnan Province. He's familiar with Chinese President Hu Jintao's top economic team including People's Bank of China Governor Zhou Xiaochuan and Finance Minister Jin Renqing.
After leaving Goldman, Mr. Paulson continued to deal intimately with China. As Treasury secretary, he was known for his outreach to the Asian nation, leading the Strategic Economic Dialogue between China and the United States. And after leaving office, he continued to speak and write as an expert on United States-China relations.
On Wednesday, David Wells, a Goldman Sachs spokesman, sought to stem any damage resulting from Mr. Blankfein's omission of Mr. Paulson's work in China. He characterized the chief's words as pertaining to the period before Mr. Paulson's tenure, when Goldman was a private company and had less international reach.
"Hank's work in China ensured that all future Goldman Sachs C.E.O.'s devoted a significant amount of their time to building on his legacy there," he said.
These, Mr. Blankfein, are the dangers of live television.

HEADLINE: At House Hearing, Schapiro Says Cost Analyses Are Slowing S.E.C.'s Work

BYLINE: EDWARD WYATT


HIGHLIGHT: At an oversight hearing, the S.E.C.'s chairwoman, Mary L. Schapiro, said that the increased analyses that Republicans have been pushing had slowed down progress toward new rules. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Republicans on a House Financial Services subcommittee on Wednesday questioned whether the Securities and Exchange Commission had strengthened the cost-benefit analyses it conducts on newly proposed regulations.
At an oversight hearing for the agency, its chairwoman, Mary L. Schapiro, said that the increased analyses that Republicans have been pushing had slowed down progress toward new rules.
"We firmly believe that cost-benefit analyses are very important," Ms. Schapiro said. "One reason we need more resources is that we're hiring many more economists" to perform the studies.
A United States Court of Appeals struck down an S.E.C. rule that would have made it easier for investors to put resolutions on ballots for shareholder vote, an issue known as proxy access. In striking down the rule, the appeals court ruled in part that the agency failed to perform an adequate cost-benefit analysis.
Ms. Schapiro said that the S.E.C. circulated new guidelines to its staff last month on how a cost-benefit study must be structured and what it should contain. But, she said, the S.E.C. is unlikely to try to propose a proxy access provision again. 
"We don't have the capacity to take that on at this time," she said, adding that the agency is required to write many new rules as part of the Dodd-Frank and JOBS acts.
Ms. Schapiro also addressed efforts to change the rules governing money-market funds, which she said were still vulnerable to runs by investors seeking to withdraw assets.
Despite some initial changes put in place in 2010, resulting from big losses suffered by the Reserve Fund in 2008, money funds still suffer from "structural weakness" that could cause funds to lose significant value again, she said.
For decades, investors have expected money-market funds fund prices to remain fixed at $1 a share. As a result, most investors consider money funds almost as safe as bank accounts. But in 2008, Reserve Fund faced a huge wave of redemptions after its funds suffered losses on Lehman bonds. That forced the Reserve Fund to "break the buck," or report a share price below a dollar and caused panic in the money-market industry.
"Investors still don't understand these investments," Ms. Schapiro said. In addition, the limited reforms made since the financial crisis "don't protect against a credit event that could cause a money market fund to break the buck."
The S.E.C. is expected to propose soon major changes in the way the funds are structured and governed. The most likely proposals, Ms. Schapiro said, are either a floating net asset value - making money funds similar to other mutual funds, whose portfolio values are calculated daily - or additional capital requirements, which would provide sponsors of the funds with more of a cash cushion for investor withdrawals.
Several members of the subcommittee objected to the proposed reforms, saying that they would make it harder for municipalities to invest in money funds and could depress returns.
Nan Hayworth, a Republican from New York, said she believed that because of changes made in 2010, money funds "are really not broken at this point," and therefore don't need to be fixed.

HEADLINE: Dewey & LeBoeuf Crisis Mirrors Legal Industry's Woes

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Michael H. Trotter, a partner at Taylor English Duma in Atlanta, says the struggles facing the law firm Dewey &#038; LeBoeuf reflect a change in the industry: too many lawyers and not enough work. 

 BODY:
The crisis confronting the law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf has stunned the legal profession. About 70 of Dewey's 300 partners have left since January after their salaries were slashed because of the firm's weak financial performance.
Dewey's woes hardly surprise Michael H. Trotter, a partner at Taylor English Duma in Atlanta who, in addition to a five-decade career as a corporate lawyer, has written two books about the economics and management of law firms.
After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1962, Mr. Trotter began his career as an associate at the predecessor firm to Alston & Bird. His first book, "Profit and the Practice of Law" (University of Georgia Press, 1997), chronicled the growth and changes in the field from 1960 to 1995. His latest, "Declining Prospects," will be released next month by Create Space, a self-publishing program owned by Amazon.com.
 In an interview, Mr. Trotter, 75, discussed the Dewey case and the broader problems facing many of the country's largest law firms.
Q.
The publication of "Declining Prospects" comes at a moment when Dewey faces the risk of collapse. The turmoil at the firm appears to be a manifestation of a lot of the issues that you discuss in your book.
A.
 I don't think Dewey's problems are just a matter of a management mistake here or there but instead reflect a change in the fundamental competitive environment in the legal services industry. Many of the larger firms that serve major business clients are caught up in these changes. We've already seen several go under, and I think we'll see quite a few more over the next few years.
Q.
What has changed?
A.
There are now far more capable lawyers and law firms than there is work for them to do. The financial costs of legal services have gotten so high that most clients are determined to reduce them. Many legal services have become commodities that can be supplied by a large number of firms with sufficient quality to meet the needs of most clients in most situations, and corporate general counsel now know that they can get what they need at a lower cost if they force the major firms to compete for the work.
Q.
One reason for Dewey's trouble is that it poached lawyers from rival firms by offering them multiyear, multimillion-dollar guaranteed contracts.
A.
 That's a very risky strategy. For one thing, people don't always produce what they promise; often not all the clients that they currently have move with them, so to give anyone a guaranteed contract based on their past success is basically a mistake. Imagine the environment where profits are dropping and there are some partners getting the full amount they were guaranteed and you're getting half of what you expected. It generates a lot of hard feelings.
Q.
 A few chapters of your latest book are devoted to the working conditions at big law firms. You describe a grim environment.
A.
 Law firms expect associates to put in 1,800 to 2,000 billable hours, and at some firms it's up to 2,500. That's 50 hours a week, 50 weeks a year. And that's just the billable time. Every lawyer has to make an investment every day of time that's not billable. You have to study and learn, improve your skills, administer to your practice. If you're working 50 hours a week of billable time, you're probably working 65 to 70 hours of total time. So the burden is tremendous. Now, with the Internet and cellphones, you're in demand possibly every hour of every day of every week.
Q.
But haven't these issues been around for years? Big law firms became big businesses a long time ago, and some will say you're just an out-of-touch, bow-tie-wearing Southern lawyer romanticizing the practice and yearning for the days of Atticus Finch.
A.
 I'm mostly reporting the feeling and attitudes that are widespread in the profession rather than my own views. The American Bar Association has concluded that lawyers at every level are unhappy with the transformation of the profession to a business and were leaving the profession in droves. And many are unhappy with their careers and their lives. I'm not against lawyers having profitable careers; I've had one myself. What "Declining Prospects" says is that our capitalistic system will adjust economic imbalances and develop more cost-effective ways of delivering legal services.
Q.
 What does the practice of corporate law look like five years from now?
A.
 We will continue to see the growth and importance of corporate law departments. The firms that are doing the commodity work, the fairly standardized stuff that any one of a number of firms could do, are going to see more of their work move in-house. It's estimated that the full cost of using outside counsel is 35 to 50 percent higher than the cost of doing their own legal work. And there are advantages in terms of controlling their time, making the in-house services more effective. That means the leverage that law firms have utilized to generate profits will go down and they aren't going to need as many associates.
Q.
 Would you encourage your grandchildren to go to law school?
A.
 I would not. It's extraordinarily competitive. We are turning out 45,000 or so law school graduates a year. The quality is very high, and there aren't jobs for them. Roughly half the lawyers in the country are sole practitioners. Seventy percent practice in firms with fewer than 20 lawyers, and for the most part they do not have the very high levels of income enjoyed by the major firms. Making a go requires three years of your life and $150,000 for a legal education. If you get a job at an elite firm, the odds of becoming a partner are probably less than 10 percent. So, it's a very rough row to hoe, and much of the work that's done is not challenging and interesting work.
Q.
 After 50 years of practice, you have a rather dim view of your profession.
A.
 My generation has been able to ride the wave of change and stay ahead of it, which has enabled me and many others to enjoy our careers. For some time now and into the future, I fear it will be much more difficult for most major business practice lawyers to maintain the high levels of compensation they have enjoyed without further sacrificing the quality of their lives and the satisfaction that they derive from the practice of law. Indeed, the danger is that compensation will decline but the present rigors of law practice will remain unabated or increase.
An earlier version of this article omitted part of an answer by Mr. Trotter to a question about Dewey's practice of recruiting lawyers by offering them multiyear, multimillion-dollar guaranteed contracts. Mr. Trotter said: "That's a very risky strategy. For one thing, people don't always produce what they promise; often not all the clients that they currently have move with them, so to give anyone a guaranteed contract based on their past success is basically a mistake." (The words "not all" had been omitted.)

HEADLINE: Ex-Morgan Stanley Executive Pleads Guilty to Violating Anticorruption Laws

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A former high-ranking Morgan Stanley real estate executive in China pleaded guilty on Wednesday to violating federal anticorruption laws as the government continued to crack down on citizens who commit fraud and bribery abroad. 

 BODY:
One of Morgan Stanley's former real estate executives in China pleaded guilty on Wednesday to violating federal anticorruption laws as the American government continues to crack down on citizens who commit fraud and bribery abroad.
The executive, Garth R. Peterson, who once ran the Shanghai office of Morgan Stanley's global real estate business, was charged with secretly acquiring millions of dollars' worth of property investments for himself and a Chinese government official. The official, in turn, steered business to Morgan Stanley's funds, the government said.
Mr. Peterson on Wednesday also settled a civil action brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission on the same matter.
 Mr. Peterson, 42, an American citizen living in Singapore, faces a maximum of five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 over the criminal charge.
As part of his settlement with the S.E.C., Mr. Peterson agreed to be barred from the securities industry, pay more than $250,000 in disgorgement and give up his interest in Shanghai real estate - currently valued at about $3.4 million.
His sentencing is set for July 17.
Frank Wohl, a lawyer for Mr. Peterson, did not immediately return a request for comment.
"Mr. Peterson admitted today that he actively sought to evade Morgan Stanley's internal controls in an effort to enrich himself and a Chinese government official," said Lanny A. Breuer, the head of the Justice Department's criminal division. "Because of his corrupt conduct, he now faces the prospect of prison time."
The case is the latest in a flurry of activity surrounding the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a 35-year-old federal law that prohibits American companies and executives from bribing government officials in foreign countries to win business.
Both the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which brought a parallel case against Mr. Peterson, have redoubled their efforts to crack down on international bribery.
The New York Times reported on Wednesday that the S.E.C. had begun an inquiry into whether Hollywood movie studios had illegally made payments to Chinese officials to ease the way for expanding into the huge potential market there. And on Sunday, The Times reported on allegations of widespread bribery at Wal-Mart's Mexican subsidiary. In response to the reports, Wal-Mart said it had enhanced its internal controls to ensure that it was complying with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
The case filed against Mr. Peterson, the former Morgan Stanley executive, dates back to the 2008 financial crisis. It was a time in which the real estate boom in China had gone bust, saddling Morgan Stanley with large losses in its Chinese real estate portfolio. Mr. Peterson was fired in 2008.
In February 2009, the bank disclosed in an S.E.C. filing that it had fired an employee in China after uncovering potential violations of the act. That employee was Mr. Peterson, the bank's highest-ranking real estate executive in the country. Morgan Stanley said that it had provided both American and Chinese officials with evidence that Mr. Peterson had secured deals by bribing Chinese officials.
Federal authorities laid out the specifics of Mr. Peterson's misconduct on Wednesday. Mr. Peterson, who speaks fluent Chinese, helped establish Morgan Stanley as one of the most prominent property investors in China. Through its real estate vehicles, known as MSREF, the bank put hundreds of millions of dollars into Chinese real estate. Mr. Peterson was involved in at least 28 deals in China, according to the S.E.C. complaint.
Mr. Peterson also had a secret business relationship with the former chairman of the Yongye Enterprise Company, a state-owned entity that exerted substantial control over real estate investing in Shanghai. In one instance, Mr. Peterson defrauded Morgan Stanley by transferring a multimillion-dollar ownership stake in a Shanghai office building to himself and Yongye's former chairman, according to court documents.
The government said that Mr. Peterson and his co-conspirators, including an unnamed Canadian lawyer, later made a profit of more than $2.5 million on the illegal deal.
The government, which places a premium on corporate cooperation in Foreign Corrupt Practices Act cases, said that Morgan Stanley voluntarily disclosed Mr. Peterson's conduct and cooperated throughout the investigation. It added that the bank had an adequate system of internal controls in place to guard against the illegal bribing of foreign government officials.
Mark Lake, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, said the firm was pleased that the matter was resolved.
Robert S. Khuzami, the director of enforcement at the S.E.C., said: "Peterson crossed the line not once, but twice. He secretly bribed a government official to illegally win business for his employer and enriched himself in violation of his fiduciary duty to Morgan Stanley's clients."

HEADLINE: Obama Sings for College Affordability

BYLINE: LILY ALTAVENA


HIGHLIGHT: As federally subsidized student loan interest rates are set to double to 6.8 percent this July, Mr. Obama visited the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, to talk about his efforts in preventing the increases. 

 BODY:
On Wednesday night, President Obama appeared on "Late Night With Jimmy Fallon" and participated in one of the show's funnier features: slow-jamming the news. The president sang about the rising interest rates on Stafford loans, using a similar refrain he'd used earlier in the day at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill.
"Now is not the time to make school more expensive for our young people," Mr. Obama said.
As federally subsidized student-loan interest rates are set to double to 6.8 percent this July, Mr. Obama visited the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, to talk about his efforts in preventing the increases.
Mr. Obama favors a temporary extension of a low interest rate on federal student loans, which Mitt Romney, the presumed Republican presidential nominee, said he also supported during a news conference on Monday afternoon. 
Mr. Obama dedicated most of his address, which lasted about 40 minutes, to the Stafford loan, which faces an increased interest rate that the president is attempting to stop through Congress.
Here is an excerpt from the speech:
Americans now owe more on their student loans than they do on their credit cards. And living with that kind of debt means that this generation is not getting off to the same start that previous generations -- because you're already loaded up with debt. So that means you've got to make pretty tough choices when you are first starting out. You might have to put off buying a house. It might mean that you can't go after that great idea for a startup that you have, because you're still paying off loans. Maybe you've got to wait longer to start a family, or save for retirement... 
....And this is something Michelle and I know about firsthand. I just wanted everybody here to understand this is not -- I didn't just read about this. I didn't just get some talking points about this. I didn't just get a policy briefing on this. Michelle and I, we've been in your shoes. Like I said, we didn't come from wealthy families.
So when we graduated from college and law school, we had a mountain of debt. When we married, we got poorer together. We added up our assets, and there were no assets. (Laughter.) And we added up our liabilities, and there were a lot of liabilities, basically in the form of student loans. We paid more in student loans than we paid on our mortgage when we finally did buy a condo. For the first eight years of our marriage, we were paying more in student loans than what we were paying for our mortgage. So we know what this is about.
And we were lucky to land good jobs with a steady income. But we only finished paying off our student loans -- check this out, all right, I'm the president of the United States -- we only finished paying off our student loans about eight years ago. That wasn't that long ago. And that wasn't easy, especially because when we had Malia and Sasha, we're supposed to be saving up for their college educations, and we're still paying off our college educations.
So we have to make college more affordable for our young people. That's the bottom line. And like I said, look, not everybody is going to go to a four-year college or university. You may go to a community college. You may go to a technical school and get into the workforce. And then, it may turn out that after you've had kids and you're 35, you go back to school because you're retraining for something new. But no matter what it is, no matter what field you're in, you're going to have to engage in lifelong learning. That's the nature of the economy today. And we've got to make sure that's affordable.

HEADLINE: Bernanke on What the Fed Can Do

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: What the chairman said about the consistency between his prescription for the Bank of Japan in the 1990s and his policies today. 

 BODY:
It's worth reading the entirety of this response from the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, to a question I raised at a news conference on Wednesday. It's a very clear statement of his views on what is probably the most important current question of economic policy: Why won't the Fed do everything in its power to reduce unemployment?
It also addresses a version of that question raised most recently and forcefully by Paul Krugman: Hasn't Mr. Bernanke himself advocated stronger measures?
Q.
A.
 Yeah, let me - let me tackle that second part first. So there's this view circulating that the views I expressed about 15 years ago on the Bank of Japan are somehow inconsistent with our current policies. That is absolutely incorrect. My views and our policies today are completely consistent with the views that I held at that time.
I made two points at that time to the Bank of Japan. The first was that I believe that a determined central bank could and should work to eliminate deflation, that is, falling prices. The second point that I made was that when short-term interest rates hit zero, the tools of a central bank are no longer - are not exhausted. There are still other things that - that the central bank can do to create additional accommodation.

Now, looking at the current situation in the United States, we are not in deflation. When deflation became a significant risk in late 2010, or at least a modest risk in late 2010, we used additional balance sheet tools to help return inflation close to the 2 percent target.
Likewise, we have been aggressive and creative in using non-federal-funds-rate-centered tools to achieve additional accommodation for - for the U.S. economy. So the - the very critical difference between the Japanese situation 15 years ago and the U.S. situation today is that Japan was in deflation. And, clearly, when you're in deflation, and in recession, then both sides of your mandate, so to speak, are demanding additional accommodation.
In this case, we are not in deflation. We have an inflation rate that's close to our objective.
Now, why don't we do more? Well, first, I would, again, reiterate that we are doing a great deal. The policy is extraordinarily accommodative. We - and I won't go through the list again, but you - you know all the things that we have done to try to provide support to the economy.
I guess the - the question is, does it make sense to actively seek a higher inflation rate in order to achieve a slightly increased reduction - a slightly increased pace of reduction in the unemployment rate?
The view of the committee is that that would be very reckless. We have - we, the Federal Reserve, have spent 30 years building up credibility for low and stable inflation, which has proved extremely valuable in that we've been able to take strong accommodative actions in the last four, five years to support the economy without leading to an unanchoring of inflation expectations or a destabilization of inflation. To risk that asset for what I think would be quite tentative and perhaps doubtful gains on the real side would be, I think, an unwise thing to do.

HEADLINE: A Conversation With: USIBC Chairman Ajay Banga

BYLINE: HEATHER TIMMONS


HIGHLIGHT: "India can't just sit there and wait for investment to come in." 

 BODY:
. 
Q.
India's trade push in recent months seems to be toward partners in Pakistan, China and the Middle East, and away from Europe and the United States. Would you agree and why is this happening now?
A.
It is a little more nuanced than that. From India's perspective when all the conversations and doors went nowhere, the country couldn't wait for its global dreams, and that's how all these deals, from Australia to Singapore, were done. In terms of Pakistan and China, it's about time they did something on that point, to reduce tensions and boiling points with these nations.
India did try to move forward with Europe in recent years, and that got nowhere. With all these bilateral deals going on, the real issue is 'should United States companies be concerned by this?'
It is very important that the U.S. corporations and the U.S. government work as hard as they can with India, on the bilateral investment treaty, or the U.S. India economic cooperation agreement.
The U.S. and the world need strong, stable growth in India.
Q.
What are the biggest issues looming this year that might affect the U.S.-India trade relationship? Iran? Visa fees? Something else?
A.
There is no doubt that the visa issue keeps popping up. Also if something unexpected happens in the price of oil, or in Europe that slows down growth, you'll always get countries acting in ways that are not the easiest environments for trade. There is so much pressure coming from domestic politics in the United States and in India now.
What is going to happen to the central government in India? That is the bigger issue. How do we keep the commercial angle on the table? That is the big picture. We want to keep all the big ideas on the table, from infrastructure funds to visa agreements to treaties.
Q.
How open is the Indian central government right now to listening to the USIBC and other foreign groups?
A.
I have perspective on India and the government, going back to all my years of living there. India has had an amazing trajectory over the past few years.
Reform is needed, and everyone gets it. The problem is politics and its compulsions, and who are we to talk about India politics, look at U.S. politics. Politics doesn't always allow reform in the way that corporations would like to see.
What we can do is talk about Indian leadership. Recent policies coming out of India have confused investors and not just in the U.S.
India can't just sit there and wait for investment to come in; [officials] have to create the environment to make sure their lunch doesn't get taken away from them.
Q.
The USIBC has been in conversations with Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee and other top politicians here about the proposed tax reform and other changes that may deter foreign investment. What is the latest?
A.
I cannot find agreement with the idea of playing around with the tax retroactively, that doesn't make sense to me. You make companies and business very confused. The ability to make sensible predictions about what happens is very important to any business model.
There has to be pressure on the Indian government by Indian business people who are raising these issues.
I think the best way to grow is to think about how to make India a more attractive destination. India needs to grow; it doesn't need to change the rules of the game. Two billion dollars [what the retroactive tax proposal could cost Vodafone, the company it is targeting first] is a really expensive price to pay.
There are so many other interesting things that can be done, from reforming the pension sector to shareholder voting rights to opening up retail foreign direct investment, to Walmart importing Alfonso mangoes, which could help this mutually beneficial relationship. There's far greater strategic benefit to be had from, say, American companies helping Indian manufacturers get better at domestic production.
All these are important ways to grow, rather than look for $2 billion [from Vodafone]. That's a really small number in a big picture.
Our two-way trade is going to be $100 billion, we should be looking at doubling that, that's going to provide way more benefit to India than the $2 billion retroactive tax.
There is so much more positive that can be done.
Q.
Do you think it matters whether the USIBC is run by someone of Indian origin or not?
A.
Yes and no. Previously you had Terry and Indra [Nooyi] and others run it successfully and now you have me, and the jury's still out on what I can do. The USIBC is much more than its chairman. With the business realities on the ground, I think I can be helpful. I was lucky, I grew up and studied in India, then I came overseas, lived in Asia and the U.S. and I've done global jobs.

HEADLINE: Romney's Victory Speech

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: The Republican Party is more to blame for the weak recovery than the president. Naturally Mitt Romney didn't mention that last night in New Hampshire. 

 BODY:
In his victory speech in New Hampshire last night, Mitt Romney mentioned the strains on working people who were hit hardest by the recession and have not seen anything like the recovery enjoyed by wealthy people - like Mitt Romney.
He mentioned President Obama, too, blaming him for that dire situation. "The last fear years have been the best that Barack Obama can do, but that's not the best America can do," Mr. Romney said. "Tonight is the beginning of the end of the disappointment of the Obama years, and the start of a new and better chapter that we will write together."

He did not mention the Republican Party, which holds more responsibility for the nation's economic sluggishness than Mr. Obama.
Mr. Romney said that in 2008, "Barack Obama dazzled us in front of Greek columns with sweeping promises of hope and change." (What exactly is wrong with Greek columns? The White House, Congress and Boston, where Mr. Romney was governor are filled with them.) And then, he said, "We came down to earth."
We sure did. As soon as Mr. Obama took office, the Republican Party announced its intention to destroy the new president by denying him everything he wanted. Mr. Obama tried to appease the opposition by making damaging compromises, but this strategy failed. The obstruction only worsened, especially after the Republicans won control of the house in 2010.
The Republicans insisted on extending the Bush tax cuts on the nation's highest earners, which were a major factor in taking the government from a budget surplus in 2000 to huge deficits by the time George W. Bush left office. And they will insist on repeating mistake again this year. They forced cuts in Mr. Obama's stimulus package, which was already too small.
They argued against extending unemployment benefits, which are not only a direct economic stimulus, but help the very Americans-the working people-that Mr. Romney says he cares so much about. And they ginned up a phony emergency over the growth of the national debt, using it to compel budget cuts that are not only too big, but are directed at programs that, again, help the very Americans Mr. Romney says he cares so much about.
Mr. Romney promised he would "stop the unfairness of politicians giving taxpayer money to their friends' businesses"-a reference, I guess, to so-called earmarks. Apart from the fact that ending earmarks won't fix the deficit or spur recovery, Mr. Romney seems to have missed the news, reported by Politico, that 65 House Republican want to "bring back a certain type of earmark so that they can help companies back home in an election year."
Not only did Mr. Romney try to blame the president for all of the country's ills, he also drew a completely false distinction between his view of government and Mr. Obama's. "Government is at the center of his vision," Mr. Romney said. "It dispenses the benefits, borrows what it cannot take, and consumes a greater and greater share of the economy." He added, "He's asking us to accept that Washington knows best, and can provide all."
The actual President Obama, as opposed to Mr. Romney's mythical socialist, has repeatedly outlined a vision of government that does for ordinary people what they cannot do for themselves, not one that makes all of their decisions for them.
If Mr. Romney wins, the government will not magically stop borrowing what it cannot take. The government cannot function otherwise-especially if Mr. Romney's party continues to demand unfairly low tax rates for the richest Americans.

HEADLINE: Debt Unforgiveness

BYLINE: DAVID FIRESTONE


HIGHLIGHT: The president blasted Congresswoman Virginia Foxx, who said she has "very little tolerance" for students who graduate with massive amounts of debt. 

 BODY:
At the University of North Carolina yesterday, President Obama blasted a congresswoman who said she has "very little tolerance" for students who graduate with debt. He did not name her, but many people in North Carolina knew (or could have guessed) that he was talking about Virginia Foxx, the snarling Republican from the northwest corner of the state, whose lack of tolerance in many areas is not a secret.
Ms. Foxx was already well known for being one of only 11 Republicans to vote against a relief package for victims of Hurricane Katrina in 2005 and for denying the need for hate crimes legislation. (The aid was likely to be abused, she said, and those who believe Matthew Shepard was killed in Wyoming because he was gay were perpetrating a "hoax.") She proposed a bill ordering the Census to identify and count all illegal immigrants, and said Obamacare was worse than any domestic terrorist.

Unfazed by Ms. Foxx's record, the current House leadership made her chairwoman of the House Subcommittee on Higher Education and Workforce Training, an enormously powerful position in a vital area. So people paid attention last week when she heaped contempt on students with big college loans.
"I have very little tolerance for people who tell me that they graduate with $200,000 of debt or even $80,000 of debt, because there's no reason for that," she said, speaking on the G. Gordon Liddy radio program. "We all live in an opportunity society and people are forgetting that."
Ms. Foxx explained that when she went to college, in the mid-1960s, she worked for her tuition and never borrowed a dime. But students these days, she suggested, think they're entitled to a government-funded education.
"I remind folks all the time that the Declaration of Independence says 'life, liberty, and the of happiness,'" she said. "You don't sit on your butt and have it dumped in your lap."
When Ms. Foxx entered the University of North Carolina in 1961, the in-state tuition for a semester there was $87.50. (To be fair, fees were another $50 or so.) That won't buy you a textbook in 2012. The price for a semester is now $3,500, having grown five times faster than inflation. With room and board and other costs, an in-state student at UNC now pays nearly $21,000 a year, and out-of-state students pay twice that. State college prices have gone up largely because state governments have drastically cut college aid. That's why students are graduating with an average debt of more than $25,000.
What exactly is Ms. Foxx's remedy? In January, when the president urged colleges to find ways to lower costs, she said he "sounds like a dictator." (Perhaps she reacted so furiously because a large number of for-profit colleges have contributed to her campaigns.) Five years ago, when Democrats passed a plan to cut subsidized student loan interest rates in half, she voted no, calling it a "big-government takeover." And Ms. Foxx, along with other House Republicans, just approved a budget plan that would let student interest rates double. So much for that opportunity society.

HEADLINE: The Water Fight That Inspired 'Chinatown'

BYLINE: FELICITY BARRINGER


HIGHLIGHT: A look at the history and the lingering impact of the water wars invoked in the1974 movie "Chinatown." 

 BODY:
For many people, at least outside the far West, the mention of California's water wars tends to conjure Roman Polanski's "Chinatown." The 1974 film classic, starring Jack Nicholson, Faye Dunaway and John Huston, is loosely based on the success of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power in siphoning off most of the Owens River, a stream fed by the snowmelt of the Eastern Sierra, and bringing it to the Los Angeles basin about a century ago.
In an article that Adam Nagourney and I just wrote for The Times, we describe angry exchanges between San Diego's water agency and a consortium of its neighbors over the roots of their 20-year fight over water. Lots of lawyers are involved. 
But six decades before San Diego squared off in court with its neighbors -- including the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power -- over the cost and reliability of its water deliveries, an even more ferocious battle was under way. The farmers of the Owens Valley were actually dynamiting the aqueducts taking their water to Los Angeles, prompting the city to send in guards with machine guns to guard its infrastructure.
There are many fine accounts of this history, among them Marc Reisner's well-known book "Cadillac Desert", which describes water issues throughout the West and epic bureaucratic battles like one between the federal Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers over control of dam building. 
But as this blog post by Christopher Hawthorne in The Los Angeles Times relates, Los Angeles's resolve to win the rights to the Owens River by any means necessary arguably redefined the city and its character.
An alternative perspective is cogently summarized in this book by Gary D. Libecap, a fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution who argues that the Owens Valley deal was the first major instance of water markets' effectively working. He casts it as a farm-to-urban transfer in which the farmers got fair value for the water, particularly because the Owens Valley was not an agricultural paradise but a marginal area with alkaline soil and low productivity.
Whichever version of the history is correct -- the scriptwriters of "Chinatown" certainly took sides -- no one was more crucial to the outcome than William Mulholland, the Irish-born civil engineer whose vision of finding water for his adopted town was as inspired as his methods were ruthless.
The movie splits his character virtually in two. One character is the visionary, careful and concerned civil engineer Hollis Mulwray, whose name lightly echoes Mulholland's. The other is the charming, brutal magnate Noah Cross, who gets to utter one of the best bits of dialogue in the movie: "Most people never have to face the fact that at the right time and the right place, they're capable of ." Cross is the Machiavellian genius behind a scheme to torque political and economic forces to ensure the transfer of water from distant farmlands.
Mulholland was both a visionary and a tactician, finding a likely source of water for his city in an inland valley 200 miles away and arranging, with the help of a federal official who did double duty working for Los Angeles, to buy up strategic parcels of land. The property lay along the route of the aqueduct they hoped to build but also in the districts that could provide them with the political and economic power they needed to control more water.
When enough farmers who shared the responsibility for and the benefits of a particular water district were lured into selling to the water and power department, the financial pressure on the remaining farmers became intense. That was mainly because there were fewer people to share the cost of maintaining the plumbing that supported local agriculture.
When 95 percent of the water rights along the river were in the hands of Mulholland's department, an aqueduct some 233 miles long was built to take the water to the city. But because the amount that was flowing to Los Angeles was more than it could use, Owens Valley water soon made the San Fernando Valley bloom and enriched inside investors who were champions of Mulholland's plans. (The relevant line from the movie, spoken by Jack Nicholson's character, J.J. Gittes: "Do you have any idea what this land would be worth with a steady water supply? About $30 million more than they paid for it.")
Eventually Los Angeles incorporated those farmlands into its boundaries. In an effort beginning in 1905, Dr. Libecap reports, the city acquired the land and water rights of 1,167 Owens Valley farms comprising 262,000 acres for about $20.7 million. (The latter figure is the equivalent of more than $220 million today.)
The one serious misjudgement in Mulholland's plan was his calculation of how fast the newly watered city would outgrow the initial infusion of water. So Mulholland and Los Angeles came back for more of the river in 1926 and 1927, and some local farmers responded by repeatedly blowing up the pipeline. Mulholland then sent dozens of armed guards to protect his aqueduct. Soon, agricultural resistance dissipated. But the legend of injustice persisted.
For decades thereafter, the Owens River was reduced to a trickle; the department Mulholland built into a powerhouse still owns much of the floor of the Owens Valley. Public ownership proved handy when the federal government was looking for sites for interning Japanese citizens during World War II; the Manzanar War Relocation Center near Lone Pine was built on land leased from Los Angeles.
Mulholland's legacy, then, is at best, ambiguous. (The catastrophic 1928 collapse of the St. Francis dam, built to hold some of the Owens Valley water, did not help.)
Whether or not the popular conception of this history, deeply reinforced by "Chinatown," is correct -- and Dr. Libecap's book argues that it is not -- there is no question that it still infects latter-day arguments about transfers of water from agricultural to urban uses in the West.
 "The Owens Valley history is important for understanding the politics of water reallocation and the difficulties faced by water markets today," Dr. Libecap writes.

HEADLINE: Super PAC Ad Tries to Tie Romney to Oil Companies

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: A TV ad supporting President Obama responds to Republican attacks on high gasoline prices. 

 BODY:
Even as Mitt Romney continues to assail President Obama on the price of gas at the pump, Democrats are pushing back by trying to tie Mr. Romney to oil companies and the wealthy interests behind them.
A new television ad financed by a "super PAC" backing Mr. Obama accuses Mr. Romney of being a "$200 million man" and says that "Big Oil's fingerprints are all over him."
The ad is by Priorities USA Action, a pro-Obama super PAC, and the League of Conservation Voters, an environmental organization, and the groups are spending about $1 million to run it in Colorado and Nevada, according to people familiar with the effort. The ad will also run online.
In it, images of Mr. Romney are partially obscured by black, oily fingerprints.
"Big Oil's pledged $200 million to help Mitt Romney. And Romney's pledged to protect their profits and billions in special tax breaks," an announcer says. "So when you fill up your tank, remember who's in the tank for Big Oil. Mitt Romney. The $200 million man."
Republicans have seized on high gas prices this spring to criticize Mr. Obama. In his victory speech after Tuesday's primary elections, Mr. Romney mentioned high gas prices several times, at one point asking the audience: "Are you paying less at the pump?" The audience yelled, "No!"
But Democrats hope that they can tie oil companies reaping big profits to Republican candidates who have opposed the elimination of tax breaks for those companies.
Andrea Saul, a spokeswoman for Mr. Romney, responded to the ad, saying that "when Americans go to the pump, if they ask themselves if gas costs are a smaller or bigger part of their budget since President Obama took office, the answer will be that they're paying twice as much. President Obama and his allies will do whatever they can to try to deflect blame and cover up for Obama's failure to control gas prices."

HEADLINE: White House Returns Fire Over Claim About Big Tax Increases

BYLINE: PETER BAKER


HIGHLIGHT: The Obama administration fired back at an adviser to Mitt Romney who had asserted that the president's economic plans would mean a huge tax increase for all Americans. 

 BODY:
The Obama administration on Wednesday fired back at an adviser to Mitt Romney who had asserted that the president's economic plans would mean a huge tax increase for all Americans.
 R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush and now an adviser to Mr. Romney, wrote in The Wall Street Journal that the spending Mr. Obama proposes for the next decade would require an 11 percent tax increase for Americans who make under $200,000 a year. That would be on top of tax increases Mr. Obama has proposed for higher-income Americans.
 The president has long pledged not to raise taxes on the middle class and poorer Americans. "President Obama's budget fails to identify the choices he will ask us to make," Mr. Hubbard wrote. "But the arithmetic is clear: His path means large tax increases for all Americans."
 Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner offered a harsh retort in an interview with John Harwood of CNBC and The New York Times on Wednesday. "That's a completely made-up, remarkably hackish observation for an economist," he said.
 Austan Goolsbee, who held the same job as Mr. Hubbard in Mr. Obama's White House before returning to the University of Chicago, offered his own rebuttal on a blog. 
 "Glenn and I have been friends for pushing 20 years, but on this one, Glenn seems to have jumped the shark," Mr. Goolsbee wrote.
Mr. Hubbard responded that his article simply relied on two arguments that are hard for Mr. Obama's advisers to refute.
 "The first is arithmetic -- raising taxes on high-income individuals generates much too little revenue to close the budget gap," he said by e-mail. "The second is policy -- righting the ship requires reducing the size of government or raising taxes more broadly. These points may be uncomfortable, but they are not controversial."

HEADLINE: 10 Questions for Timothy F. Geithner

BYLINE: JOHN HARWOOD


HIGHLIGHT: The treasury secretary discusses the still fragile recovery and the quickening economic debate in the presidential campaign. 

 BODY:
The attacks on Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner that marked the early part of the Obama administration have died down somewhat as the economy has recovered. But struggles in Europe have created new economic challenges as Mr. Geithner serves out the remaining months of Mr. Obama's first term, as the president implored him to. After touring a manufacturing plant in Clackamas, Ore., Mr. Geithner sat down Wednesday with John Harwood of The Times and CNBC to discuss the still fragile recovery and the quickening economic debate in the presidential campaign. 
Below is a condensed, edited transcript of their conversation.
Q.
We now know that the United Kingdom is in recession, the Euro Zone is in recession. Are we now looking at the prospect of another springtime disappointment after positive economic signs, like we experienced in 2010 and 2011?
A.
We're not an island of prosperity unto ourselves. And so we get affected by what happens beyond our shores. We saw in 2010 and 2011 as the economy was recovering, you know, we got hit by Europe, by oil, by Japan. That caused growth to slow here. But we're gradually getting stronger. And Europe is doing a better job of managing their crisis. The most likely thing you're going to see is that Europe contains the risk of a major cataclysm. They can let these reforms take some time to work. And our economy should continue to get gradually strengthened through that.
Q.
Austan Goolsbee, the former chairman of the president's economic advisers, thinks odds are at least 50-50 that private forecasters are right, that we're looking at growth of 2 or 2.5 percent of G.D.P, and that if it's at that level, you can "kiss job market improvements goodbye." Is the administration helpless to do anything about that?
A.
 Well, the most important thing, the most valuable thing we could do for the economy now is for Congress to act to pass some concrete things -- to strengthen infrastructure, help export growth, help Americans refinance their mortgages, take advantage of lower rates, prevent student loan rates from increasing, as you heard the president talk about this week. Most private business forecasters look at the American economy, they see the economy growing between 2 percent and 3 percent. Not surprising as we dig out of this recession. But it's looking more resilient and the strength is more broad-based.
Q.
The fact that the U.K. is in recession is fueling debate over whether austerity policies are at odds with recovery. The Wall Street Journal editorial page had a piece today saying that Germany had done the world a favor by rejecting advice from President Obama and you to join the global spending party. Why are they wrong?
A.
 An important big debate for the United States right now. But Germany did about the same level of actual stimulus we did in 2009. And they did it for the same reason we did, which is the world was burning. It's important for everybody to recognize we're going to have to act to bring our long-term deficits down. We have to do that in a way where we phase in the reforms, so they don't damage growth. It would be a terrible mistake, economically, for the United States to lurch, prematurely, to extreme austerity, to severe austerity. That would undo a huge amount of the progress we made repairing the damage from the crisis, would push unemployment up. It would push us back into recession.
Q.
 There's an emerging critique from the other party that President Obama's a nice guy, well-intentioned guy, but he's in over his head. What do you say to that?
A.
 It's just politics. If you look at what the president did, he didn't sit back and let this crisis burn. He didn't commission a bunch of studies. He didn't play politics with it. He acted with enormous courage, no political support from his opposition, and put together a remarkably effective rescue strategy for the American economy and the global economy. 
We have more than four million private industry jobs created. We should have a debate about what is going to make the economy stronger in the future. And there are big differences between the strategy the president has put in place and the strategy of his opponents. A huge part of the president's strategy is a growth strategy, designed to improve opportunity by making sure Americans can take advantage of better educational training opportunities.
We're rebuilding America's infrastructure. We're investing in innovation. And we're protecting the basic safety net for low-income Americans and seniors. We can do all that and still put in a place a balanced plan to bring down our deficits over time. I'm very confident that's the right strategy for the country. It's a very different strategy than the strategy of our opponents, who are focused primarily on how to cut regulation, even in the financial sector, how to roll back health care reforms that provide health care to millions of Americans, and how to bring deficits down without asking even a modest additional burden on the top 2 percent of Americans.
Q.
 They argue that your plan is to raise taxes. Glenn Hubbard, dean of the Columbia Business School, wrote a piece today saying that the
president's spending commitments would require an 11 percent tax increase on people under $200,000 a year.
A.
 That's a completely made-up, remarkably hackish observation for an economist. The president's fiscal reform plan would bring our deficits down to below 3 percent of G.D.P. over the next four years, so that the debt burden stops growing as a share of the economy. We propose a series of tax reforms that would modestly increase the burden, but only on the top 2 percent of Americans -- 98 percent of Americans would see no increase in their effective tax burden. 
Now the alternative strategy of our opponents asks no additional burden on even the most fortunate Americans. And as a result puts a huge burden on reducing benefits for low-income Americans, for retirees. And would completely gut and erode our capacity to support things like education and infrastructure that are absolutely essential to our capacity to grow in the future.
Q.
 Do you and the administration accept any responsibility for the contribution that the prospect of higher taxes and increased regulation under Dodd-Frank might play in slowing economic recovery?
A.
 It is true that we are putting in place some tough reforms on the financial system, because we don't want the country to face the risk of another crisis like we've been through. You know, we're still living with the scars of the crisis. And the reasons why unemployment is so high today, why housing is still so hard, why this is still such a tough economy, is overwhelmingly because of the damage and the aftershocks of that basic crisis, which, of course, the financial sector was central to. 
But there is no evidence to suggest that those regulations are having a material impact on slowing the economy down. The profitability of the American business sector today is much higher than it was before the crisis. The debate we're having on taxes is just about whether 2 percent of American individuals and about 3 percent of small businesses would face a modest increase in their effective tax rates. There's no plausible argument you can make that that modest increase in such a small fraction of the American economy is having a material effect on behavior today.
Q.
 You're going to Beijing for the strategic economic dialogue. As you know, Mitt Romney, the, presumptive Republican nominee, has said that your administration and previous administrations have been played by the Chinese. He will fix that, negotiate more effectively, by declaring them a currency manipulator on Day 1. Why wouldn't that be a more effective strategy?
A.
 By just calling them a name? Like you can solve problems in the world, a very complicated world we live in, by calling people
names? It's true China presents a very complicated mix of
opportunities and challenges for the American economy today. But our exports to China over the last few years have been growing very, very rapidly. China has let the exchange rate appreciate by roughly 13 percent against the dollar, in real terms, over that period of time. The
competitive playing field is shifting in our direction. That's the results of a very successful and very tough strategy of the president.
Q.
 Mitt Romney has a record as a fairly sophisticated businessman. Why shouldn't Americans have more confidence in his ability to negotiate with China? What would happen if you named China a currency manipulator?
A.
 Nothing would happen, except you would diminish the incentive they have to move. It comes with no effective sanction or action. If it had been an effective way to get change in China, then bipartisan, Democrat and Republican presidents over time would have embraced that basic strategy. But it had no merit as a basic strategy. And it does carry the risk of a trade war, which is why there's so much opposition to that basic policy.
Q.
 Walmart recently lost a huge proportion of its market value as a result of a controversy over potential violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. There's now an S.E.C. investigation of Hollywood into whether or not improper payments were involved in some marketing openings there. How extensive of a problem do you believe it is? If a corporate executive said to you, "Competitive world -- we've got to do whatever we can to get an advantage," what would you say to them?
A.
 I don't have a good feel for it, John, and don't feel I can comment on either of those two cases. I'd say: "You've got to follow the law of the land. And you've got to make sure that you're honoring the letter and the spirit of the laws that you are governed by, in that context." We're going to make sure we have strong, consistent, credible enforcement of those rules.
Q.
 There was a report quoting your father-in-law the other day, suggesting that the president's appointment of the president of Dartmouth to be the head of the World Bank was connected with a plan to have you become the president of Dartmouth. Do you want to become the president of Dartmouth? Was that part of the president's decision-making? Have you talked to your father-in-law about it?
A.
 Completely contrived myth. Played no role in that context. He called me about it. He said, "I didn't say that."

HEADLINE: Rallies Will Kick Off Obama Re-election Bid

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: President Obama and the first lady will hold two campaign rallies next week in what Mr. Obama's political advisers are calling the official opening of his re-election effort. 

 BODY:
President Obama and the first lady will hold two big campaign rallies next week in what Mr. Obama's political advisers are calling the official opening of his effort to win a second term in the White House.
"Welcome to the general election," Jim Messina, Mr. Obama's campaign manager, told reporters on a conference call Wednesday evening.
A text message went out to millions of Mr. Obama's supporters shortly after the call: "Big news," it said. "President Obama is holding the first public rallies of the campaign on May 5."
The announcement came swiftly after Mitt Romney claimed the Republican nomination on Tuesday evening and after the Republican National Committee on Wednesday morning formally announced its intention to integrate with his campaign. Aides to Newt Gingrich also said Wednesday that Mr. Gingrich planned to leave the race next week.
The declaration that Mr. Obama would formally begin campaigning brought quick scoffs from Republicans -- including Mr. Romney's advisers -- who have argued for weeks that Mr. Obama has been campaigning for weeks at events disguised as official presidential trips. The R.N.C. wrote a letter to the General Accountability Office asking for an inquiry into whether Mr. Obama might be using taxpayer resources for what are effectively campaign events.
David Axelrod, a senior strategist for the president, dismissed the Republican criticism, saying that the president's decision to argue for the lower student loan rates during a tour of college campuses in recent days was "a very important issue" for students and graduates facing higher payments.
He said the campaign was "not going to get hot and bothered by R.N.C. stunts."
Mr. Axelrod and Mr. Messina described the two coming rallies -- one in Columbus, Ohio, and the other in Richmond, Va. -- as the kickoff events of a campaign in which Mr. Obama would steadily begin to ramp up his direct campaigning.
Mr. Messina said that the president's re-election strategy remained unchanged now that Mr. Romney is the clear Republican nominee.
"What Governor Romney decides to do or doesn't decide to do doesn't affect us at all," Mr. Messina said. He and Mr. Axelrod both described the choice facing voters as one of moving forward with the president's policies or going backward to policies that have already failed.
Gail Gitcho, the communications director for Mr. Romney, quickly responded with a statement, saying: "If President Obama's record was as good as Mitt Romney's, he'd be running on it. Instead, he is running away from it. No matter how hard President Obama tries to make this election about something else, as Mitt Romney said last night, 'It's still the economy, and we're not stupid.' "
Mr. Romney's campaign also quickly put out a statement from Bob McDonnell, the Republican governor of Virginia.
"In less than two weeks, President Obama will bring his failed policies and broken promises to Virginia," said Mr. McDonnell, a possible vice presidential pick for Mr. Romney. "His policies have taken our country in the wrong direction, and Virginia and the rest of the nation can't afford four more years of the same."

HEADLINE: We Are Not Stupid

BYLINE: CHARLES M. BLOW


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney is trying to frame the election as an economic referendum, but there's a lot more to it than that. 

 BODY:
It's still about Mitt Romney, and we're not stupid.
After his primary wins on Tuesday, Mitt Romney delivered a nice speech with some punchy lines, and the pundits jumped and flipped like a troupe from Cirque du Soleil.
But it was all about framing an argument. It was tactical.
I don't give two cents about tactics at the moment. I prefer to keep my eyes squarely trained on the issues and where the parties and their candidates have either demonstrated or indicated that they plan to take the country.
That reveals their values. That reveals a contrast so stark that no theatrical triumph or failure can disguise or ameliorate it.
Romney is still Romney and he's still running as the head of a party that has spent the last few years pursuing a profoundly regressive agenda.
Romney tried Tuesday night to frame the debate largely around economic issues, but as the 2010 midterm elections showed, economic issues are something of a Trojan horse for the right.
Let's just get this out of the way: Times are tough. But most people are smart enough to know that these tough times were long in the making and will be long in the fixing. There are no magic words or silver bullets or emerging bubbles that will quickly and easily return us to a pre-recession, pre-collapse sense of prosperity.
That is because we were all complicit in a lie. The government spent too much (on tax cuts and wars), many banks gambled too much and many people borrowed too much. That was the economy. All that money swirling around lulled us into a false sense of security.
When it all fell apart, an overextended government had to help overextended banks and overextended borrowers. The money stopped swirling. Jobs that flourished during the boom became scarce.
The debt grew and the economy shrank.
The government underestimated the crisis and underfinanced the stimulus package aimed at fixing it. So things got worse before they slowly began to get better. And structural economic issues, like the deflation in the housing market, remain.
In an oversimplified nutshell, that is what happened: a complex mix of poor choices and inadequate responses. Now we have to ask ourselves if things have fundamentally changed forever.
The president tried to help fix a mess that he didn't make, but the fixing has come slowly. Is that failure? Romney and the Republicans say yes.
And, if they can keep framing it as a failure, they can push for, and maybe even push through, their brutal budgets, which cut programs that help the poor and struggling and benefit the rich.
And while they push their budgets, they make savage attacks on a broad range of issues: voting rights, women's rights, gay rights, immigration, etc.
This is the trick: Run on fiscal conservatism; bring social conservatism along for the ride. The Trojan horse platform.
Mitt Romney has made clear during this primary season that he was willing to be neither moderate nor independent - but rather "severely conservative" - in seeking the Republican nomination. He was willing to court the far right wing of his party and advance its agenda - a frightening fiscal agenda and an even more frightening social agenda.
Yes, this election is about the economy. Every election is to some degree. But it is also about priorities and values and the social direction of this country. This is about the uniquely different visions of our country as presented by Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, and about which man is most likely to be effective and fair.
No number of tactical speeches will make us forget that. We are not stupid.

HIGHLIGHT: Highlights from the DealBook newsletter. 

 BODY:
TOP STORIES
Credit Suisse Profit Falls 96% in First Quarter | Credit Suisse said on Wednesday that profit fell 96 percent in the first quarter, as the big Swiss bank continued to contend with the dual headwinds of a new regulatory environment and an economic slump.
Profit in the first three months of the year fell to 44 million Swiss francs ($48 million) from 1.1 billion francs in the first quarter of 2011, driven by a charge on the value on its own debt and a pullback in its investment banking business. Net revenue dropped to 5.9 billion francs from 7.8 billion francs.
Despite the weakness, the bank exceeded analysts' estimates. It also showed a marked improvement from the previous quarter, when it reported a loss of 637 million Swiss francs. DealBook 
Fraud Heightens Jeopardy of Investing in Chinese Firms | You might think that if you bought shares of a Chinese company that was listed on an American stock market, you would actually own a piece of that company.
Unfortunately, it is not that simple, the Deal Professor writes. The recent cases of the ChinaCast Education Corporation and the Sino-Forest Corporation show that in many instances, foreign investors in Chinese companies might have bought shares that do not really represent much. It is a problem that has the potential to extend to even the soundest Chinese company listed in the United States.
The ChinaCast case is not the most egregious, but it is certainly the most scandalous. In March, its chief executive, Ron Chan, was ousted in a battle for shareholder control of the company. An American investor succeeded not only in replacing Mr. Chan, but also in obtaining control of the ChinaCast board. Yet that turned out to be only the beginning of the battle. DealBook

HIGHLIGHT: In presidential campaigns dating to 1972, the national polling leader in late April has won the election only half of the time. 

 BODY:
Since Rick Santorum suspended his presidential campaign, essentially ending the Republican primary contest, the starting positions for the general election have taken shape. About 10 national polls have been released: President Obama leads Mitt Romney 47.7 percent to 43.7 percent, according to the RealClearPolitics average of recent surveys.
Already, partisans and pundits are criticizing individual polling samples and pollster methodologies. Entire "-gates" - Rosen-gate and dog-gate, for example - have erupted, been fought over and then forgotten in mere days, and each poll is scrutinized to see how the latest controversy has affected the race.
It is easy to get lost in the weeds. But, of course, the election is still more than six months away, and in the past 10 presidential campaigns, the national polling leader in late April has won the election only half of the time. 
Drawn from FiveThirtyEight's polling database, which includes thousands of surveys, here is the average of the 10 most recent national polls as of late April in each election year going back to 1972 (for the 1980 election and before, fewer than 10 general election polls conducted in the first four months of the year were available).
The leader in national polls at the end of April in the past two elections has gone on to win. Before 2004, however, the April leader lost the popular vote more often than not. 
The two biggest misses came in 1980 and 1992, both years that featured legitimate third-party candidates. President Jimmy Carter was narrowly leading a three-way race in 1980, with the independent John Anderson garnering nearly 21 percent of the vote (Mr. Carter actually led Ronald Reagan by 15 percentage points when polls tested a head-to-head match-up).
Of course, the race shifted quickly. By June 30, The Times's William Safire wrote:
In the federal bureaucracy, the sense of the inevitability of Reagan permeates the attitude of "Schedule C" appointees; 2,000 plum-holders in the middle reaches of the Carter administration are busily preparing rsums.
Mr. Carter would lose to Mr. Reagan by almost 10 percentage points, and Mr. Anderson would win just 7 percent of the vote.
In late April 1992, Bill Clinton was statistically tied with the independent Ross Perot, and both were trailing President George Bush. Mr. Clinton would go on to outperform his April polling in November by 16 percentage points.
The list goes on: In late April 1976, President Gerald R. Ford was more than five percentage points ahead of Mr. Carter. Mr. Ford would lose by 2 points. Michael Dukakis was ahead of George Bush in April 1988, and Mr. Bush's son, George W., was ahead of Al Gore in April 2000. The elder Bush went on to win the election outright, while George W. lost the popular vote but won the presidency after a protracted court fight.
The polls were not necessarily "wrong" in these cases. They may have been an accurate measure of each race at that time. But the quality of campaigns and candidates can sway allegiances, and real-world events often intervene.
On April 24, 1980, the United States launched Operation Eagle Claw, a covert mission to rescue the American hostages being held in Iran. The mission would end in disaster, deeply wounding Mr. Carter's re-election effort.
In 1992, the elder Mr. Bush saw the sky-high approval ratings he enjoyed in early 1991 tumble into the 30s as the economy stalled. In 2004, President George W. Bush eked out re-election, helped, many believe, by an Osama bin Laden video message released days before the vote.
In the 2012 election, the daily push-and-pull between the Obama and Romney campaigns, as well as intermittent swings in the horse-race polling, will often be the focus on political blogs and television. But general election polls have a stronger tendency to revert to the mean, and the fruits of a well-executed campaign strategy or the lasting implications of a news event are likely to take time to truly manifest themselves.
The winner of each day's news cycle might seem important in the moment, but there are still 195 days, and news cycles, remaining till Nov. 6. And since 1972, winning in April has been no guarantee of winning in November.

HEADLINE: China Slows Down, and Grows Up

BYLINE: By RUCHIR SHARMA. 
Ruchir Sharma, the head of emerging market equities at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, is the author of ''Breakout Nations: In Pursuit of the Next Economic Miracles.''

 BODY:
MORE than half of Americans think China is already the world's leading economy -- an astonishing misperception, given that China's gross domestic product is still less than half of America's. As George Orwell once observed, ''Whoever is winning at the moment will always seem to be invincible.'' China has grown at a breakneck pace for so long that its aura of invincibility has grown to outsize proportions in the Western imagination.
Now, however, there are signs that China's growth is slowing to a rate that is ideal for the interests of the United States: fast enough to remain an important pillar of global economic growth, but not fast enough for China to remain a disruptive threat to American power. 
The news of a slowdown in China, which just posted its worst quarter since 2009, has reignited the debate over its future. The consensus remains bullish, and is captured in the latest forecast by the International Monetary Fund, which expects China's G.D.P. to continue growing at an annual rate of around 8 percent for five more years. A bearish minority, however, reads the warning signs -- labor unrest, a housing bubble, an unprecedented investment binge -- as a sign of impending collapse. Neither side has got it right. In fact, China has reached a stage at which all ''miracle economies'' have slowed significantly, but not disastrously.
It is well known that developing nations hit a ''middle-income trap,'' and stop catching up to rich nations, when per-capita income reaches about $5,000 to $15,000 (in current dollars). The examples (Brazil, Mexico, Malaysia) are numerous. What is less known is that even those rare economies that broke through the middle-class trap started to decelerate -- still catching up, but more slowly -- after reaching a per capita income of around $5,000 (in current dollars). Japan in the 1970s, Taiwan in the 1980s and South Korea in the 1990s all slowed from a growth rate of about 9 percent to around 5 percent, simply because the bigger the economy, the harder it becomes to grow fast.
China passed the $5,000 per capita income level last year, and is now showing the same signs of deceleration that Japan, Taiwan and South Korea exhibited at that level: rising labor demands for higher wages and a decreasing demand for new investments. China's growth model is similar to Japan's in the 1970s, and the most likely scenario is that China will follow the path of Japan in that decade, when its growth rate slowed to 5 percent. China will continue to catch up to the United States, but its growth will slow to a pace of around 6 to 7 percent over the next 5 to 10 years. At that point, China's economy will be even larger, and may decelerate again.
This process is under way, and it signals a basic power shift in the global economy. China became the biggest contributor to global G.D.P. growth in 2007, and it has held the lead ever since. But if the United States continues to grow at its current pace of about 2.5 percent, and China slows to 6.5 percent, then the United States will regain the lead this year -- contributing 23 percent of global growth in 2012, compared to 18 percent for China -- and it will hold that lead at least through 2015, according to Morgan Stanley research.
Investors who have bet big on near-double-digit growth in China will be troubled by this slowdown and will start looking for a safer destination. With Europe and Japan both growing at less than 2 percent, the focus of global attention will shift to the improving competitive position of the United States, and capital flows will follow.
China's slowdown is setting the stage for a drop in the price of oil, which has had a crippling effect on growth in the United States. In recent years China has accounted for nearly half of global growth in oil demand, and every 1 percent of G.D.P. growth in China added 10 to 30 percent to the price of oil.
China's slowdown is also opening the door to a revival in American manufacturing. China is suffering many symptoms typical of a maturing miracle economy, from a strengthening currency to rising wages, land prices and transport costs, while the United States has a weak currency, stagnant wages and a moribund property market. The dollar is near record lows (in inflation-adjusted terms) against many of its trading partners, including China. The long-term decline in the United States' share of global manufacturing exports bottomed out in 2008 at 8 percent, but has since been inching higher. The Boston Consulting Group predicts that by 2015, China will have lost most of its cost advantages, accelerating the ''reshoring'' that is already bringing some factory jobs back home from China.
These shifts will reshape the global balance of economic power, mostly for the better. A collapse in China to zero percent growth would be disastrous for the world economy, but it is unlikely, in large part because Chinese leaders understand that the current slowdown is inevitable. They are lowering growth targets and trying to manage rather than fight the deceleration (which would only make it worse).
At the near double-digit growth rate of the last 15 years, China was the equivalent of a company with disruptive technology -- destroying competitors, lifting suppliers, sucking in capital, stealing jobs and moving so fast that rivals couldn't keep up. A smooth downshift to 6 or 7 percent makes China a more normal rival, one the world can do business with and compete head to head against -- one that should generate a lot less worry.

HEADLINE: Durable Goods Orders Show The Sharpest Drop in 3 Years

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Orders for long-lasting factory goods fell by the largest amount in three years last month, mostly because demand for commercial aircraft plummeted. 
But companies also ordered less machinery and other equipment, in a sign that manufacturing output may slow.
Orders for durable goods dropped 4.2 percent in March, the steepest since January 2009, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. Commercial aircraft orders, a volatile category, fell by nearly 50 percent.
Durable goods, which include appliances, cars and heavy machinery, are products that are expected to last at least three years.
Excluding transportation equipment, orders declined 1.1 percent. That is the second drop in that category in three months.
And orders for so-called core capital goods, a solid measure of business investment plans, declined 0.8 percent. Companies cut their orders for steel and other metals, industrial machinery and computers.
Shipments of durable goods increased last month, which added to growth in the first three months of the year. The government will report on the economy's first-quarter growth on Friday.
But the decline in orders indicates that growth may slow in the months ahead, economists said. ''This was a weak report,'' said Ellen Zentner, senior economist at Nomura Securities. It ''certainly points to slowing business investment as we enter the second quarter.''
Orders for autos and auto parts ticked up 0.1 percent, far below February's 2 percent gain. Auto production increased as Americans bought more cars and trucks this year, bolstering output at auto plants and their suppliers. But March's tiny increase suggests auto output is slowing.
Changes in aircraft orders mostly reflect orders received by Boeing. The company has generally reported rising demand since last fall, but Ms. Zentner said that it received orders for 53 aircraft in March, compared with 237 in February.
In March, orders for durable goods totaled $202.6 billion -- 36 percent above the recession low. But orders remained 17 percent below their peak in December 2007.

HEADLINE: Chasing Fees, Banks Court Low Earners

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG and BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
When David Wegner went looking for a checking account in January, he was peppered with offers for low-end financial products, including a prepaid debit card with numerous fees, a short-term emergency loan with steep charges, money wire services and check-cashing options.
''I may as well have gone to a payday lender,'' said Mr. Wegner, a 36-year-old nursing assistant in Minneapolis, who ended up choosing a local branch of U.S. Bank and avoided the payday lenders, pawnshops and check cashers lining his neighborhood.
Along with a checking account, he selected a $1,000 short-term loan to help pay for his cystic fibrosis medications. The loan cost him $100 in fees, and that will escalate if it goes unpaid.
An increasing number of the nation's large banks -- U.S. Bank, Regions Financial and Wells Fargo among them -- are aggressively courting low-income customers like Mr. Wegner with alternative products that can carry high fees. They are rapidly expanding these offerings partly because the products were largely untouched by recent financial regulations, and also to recoup the billions in lost income from recent limits on debit and credit card fees. 
Banks say that they are offering a valuable service for customers who might not otherwise have access to traditional banking and that they can offer these products at competitive prices. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a new federal agency, said it was examining whether banks ran afoul of consumer protection laws in the marketing of these products.
In the push for these customers, banks often have an advantage over payday loan companies and other storefront lenders because, even though banks are regulated, they typically are not subject to interest rate limits on payday loans and other alternative products.
Some federal regulators and consumer advocates are concerned that banks may also be steering people at the lowest end of the economic ladder into relatively expensive products when lower-cost options exist at the banks or elsewhere.
''It is a disquieting development for poor customers,'' said Mark T. Williams, a former Federal Reserve Bank examiner. ''They are getting pushed into high-fee options.''
''We look at alternative financial products offered by both banks and nonbanks through the same lens -- what is the risk posed to consumers?'' said Richard Cordray, director of the bureau. ''Practices that make it hard for consumers to anticipate and avoid costly fees would be cause for concern.''
Analysts in the banking industry say that lending to low-income customers, especially those with tarnished credit, is tricky and that banks sometimes have to charge higher rates to offset their risk. Still, in an April survey of prepaid cards, Consumers Union found that some banks' prepaid cards come with lower fees than nonbank competitors.
While banks have offered short-term loans and some check-cashing services in the past, they are introducing new products and expanding some existing ones. Last month, Wells Fargo introduced a reloadable prepaid card, while Regions Financial in Birmingham, Ala., unveiled its ''Now Banking'' suite of products that includes bill pay, check cashing, money transfers and a prepaid card.
The Regions package is meant to attract the ''growing pay-as-you-go consumer,'' said John Owen, the bank's senior executive vice president for consumer services.
The packages are the latest twist on ''cross-selling,'' in which lenders compete to win a larger share of customer business with deals on checking, savings accounts and mortgages.
Reaching the so-called unbanked or underbanked population -- people who use few, if any, bank services -- could be lucrative, industry consultants said. Kimberly Gartner, vice president for advisory services at the Center for Financial Services Innovation, said that such borrowers were a $45 billion untapped market.
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation estimates that about nine million households in the country do not have a traditional bank account, while 21 million, or 18 percent, of Americans are underbanked.
Mr. Wegner, the U.S. Bank customer, said that once he mentioned that he needed a bank account, an employee started selling him prepaid cards, check cashing and short-term loan options. Mr. Wegner, who makes about $1,200 a month, said that he felt like a second-tier customer.
''It was clear that I was not getting the same pitches that wealthy clients would,'' he said. Since that initial visit, Mr. Wegner said he avoided the branch so he was not approached with offers. ''I go through the drive-through now,'' he said.
Bank payday loans, which are offered as advances on direct-deposit paychecks, are a particularly vexing part of the new pitch from lenders, consumer advocates said. The short-term, high-fee loans, like the one Mr. Wegner received, are offered by a handful of banks, including Wells Fargo. In May, Regions introduced its ''Ready Advance'' loan after determining that some of its customers were heading to storefront payday lenders.
The loans can get expensive. When the loan comes due, the bank automatically withdraws from the customer's checking account the amount of the loan and the origination fee -- typically $10 for every $100 borrowed -- regardless of whether there is enough money in the account. That can lead to overdraft and other fees that translate into an annual interest rate of more than 300 percent, according to the Center for Responsible Lending.
The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which oversees the nation's largest banks, said in June that the loans raised ''operational and credit risks and supervisory concerns.'' Last summer, federal bank regulators ordered MetaBank, which is based in Iowa, to return $4.8 million to customers who took out high-interest loans.
Lenders are also joining the prepaid card market. In 2009, consumers held about $29 billion in prepaid cards, according to the Mercator Advisory Group, a payments industry research group. By the end of 2013, the market is expected to reach $90 billion. A big lure for banks is that prepaid cards are not restricted by Dodd-Frank financial regulation law. That exemption means that banks are able to charge high fees when a consumer swipes a prepaid card.
The companies distributing the cards have drawn criticism for not clearly disclosing fees that can include a charge to activate the card, load money on it and even to call customer service. Customers with a ''convenient cash'' prepaid card from U.S. Bank, for example, pay a $3 fee to enroll, a $3 monthly maintenance fee, $3 to visit a bank teller and $15 dollars to replace a lost card.
Capital One charges prepaid card users $1.95 for using an A.T.M. more than once a month, while Wells Fargo charges $1 to speak to a customer service agent more than twice a month.
Some smaller banks even offer prepaid cards with credit lines, which carry steep interest charges.
''This is a two-tiered, separate and unequal system and it is worsening,'' said Sarah Ludwig, a lawyer who started the Neighborhood Economic Development Advocacy Project.
Some lenders are even styling their offices to look like check-cashing stores. In June, Redstone Federal Credit Union, the largest credit union in Alabama, will open two stores that are designed to look exactly like check cashers.
One of the stores, in Decatur, Ala., is part of a run-down strip mall and includes a sign that says ''Right Choice, Money Services.'' An adjacent store, not affiliated with Redstone, advertises loans for people who ''need money fast.''
''It looks like a check casher, but once you get inside you get the best of both worlds,'' Peter Alvarez, Redstone's emerging markets manager. The stores will offer traditional checking and savings accounts alongside prepaid cards, money transfer and bill paying. ''We wanted to attract people who wouldn't naturally come to a bank.''

HEADLINE: Ex-Morgan Stanley Official Pleads Guilty to Violating Anticorruption Laws

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
One of Morgan Stanley's former real estate executives in China pleaded guilty on Wednesday to violating federal anticorruption laws as the American government continues to crack down on citizens who commit fraud and bribery abroad.
The executive, Garth R. Peterson, who once ran the Shanghai office of Morgan Stanley's global real estate business, was charged with secretly acquiring millions of dollars' worth of property investments for himself and a Chinese government official. The official, in turn, steered business to Morgan Stanley's funds, the government said.
Mr. Peterson on Wednesday also settled a civil action brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission on the same matter. 
Mr. Peterson, 42, an American citizen living in Singapore, faces a maximum of five years in prison and a fine of up to $250,000 over the criminal charge.
As part of his settlement with the S.E.C., Mr. Peterson agreed to be barred from the securities industry, pay more than $250,000 in disgorgement and give up his interest in Shanghai real estate - currently valued at about $3.4 million.
His sentencing is set for July 17.
Frank Wohl, a lawyer for Mr. Peterson, did not immediately return a request for comment.
''Mr. Peterson admitted today that he actively sought to evade Morgan Stanley's internal controls in an effort to enrich himself and a Chinese government official,'' said Lanny A. Breuer, the head of the Justice Department's criminal division. ''Because of his corrupt conduct, he now faces the prospect of prison time.''
The case is the latest in a flurry of activity surrounding the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a 35-year-old federal law that prohibits American companies and executives from bribing government officials in foreign countries to win business.
Both the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which brought a parallel case against Mr. Peterson, have redoubled their efforts to crack down on international bribery.
The New York Times reported on Wednesday that the S.E.C. had begun an inquiry into whether Hollywood movie studios had illegally made payments to Chinese officials to ease the way for expanding into the huge potential market there. And on Sunday, The Times reported on allegations of widespread bribery at Wal-Mart's Mexican subsidiary. In response to the reports, Wal-Mart said it had enhanced its internal controls to ensure that it was complying with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.
The case filed against Mr. Peterson, the former Morgan Stanley executive, dates back to the 2008 financial crisis. It was a time in which the real estate boom in China had gone bust, saddling Morgan Stanley with large losses in its Chinese real estate portfolio. Mr. Peterson was fired in 2008.
In February 2009, the bank disclosed in an S.E.C. filing that it had fired an employee in China after uncovering potential violations of the act. That employee was Mr. Peterson, the bank's highest-ranking real estate executive in the country. Morgan Stanley said that it had provided both American and Chinese officials with evidence that Mr. Peterson had secured deals by bribing Chinese officials.
Federal authorities laid out the specifics of Mr. Peterson's misconduct on Wednesday. Mr. Peterson, who speaks fluent Chinese, helped establish Morgan Stanley as one of the most prominent property investors in China. Through its real estate vehicles, known as MSREF, the bank put hundreds of millions of dollars into Chinese real estate. Mr. Peterson was involved in at least 28 deals in China, according to the S.E.C. complaint.
Mr. Peterson also had a secret business relationship with the former chairman of the Yongye Enterprise Company, a state-owned entity that exerted substantial control over real estate investing in Shanghai. In one instance, Mr. Peterson defrauded Morgan Stanley by transferring a multimillion-dollar ownership stake in a Shanghai office building to himself and Yongye's former chairman, according to court documents.
The government said that Mr. Peterson and his co-conspirators, including an unnamed Canadian lawyer, later made a profit of more than $2.5 million on the illegal deal.
The government, which places a premium on corporate cooperation in Foreign Corrupt Practices Act cases, said that Morgan Stanley voluntarily disclosed Mr. Peterson's conduct and cooperated throughout the investigation. It added that the bank had an adequate system of internal controls in place to guard against the illegal bribing of foreign government officials.
Mark Lake, a spokesman for Morgan Stanley, said the firm was pleased that the matter was resolved.
Robert S. Khuzami, the director of enforcement at the S.E.C., said: ''Peterson crossed the line not once, but twice. He secretly bribed a government official to illegally win business for his employer and enriched himself in violation of his fiduciary duty to Morgan Stanley's clients.''
David Barboza contributed reporting.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Expand Minds, Not the N.Y.U. Campus

BYLINE: By ERNEST DAVIS, PATRICK DEER and MARK CRISPIN MILLER. 
Ernest Davis is a professor of computer science at New York University, where Patrick Deer is an associate professor of English and Mark Crispin Miller is a professor of media, culture and communication.

 BODY:
FOR much of the last decade, universities across the country have been spending many millions on construction projects, building grand new campuses to draw more students.
That national trend has a strong champion in New York University's president, John Sexton, the driving force behind N.Y.U. 2031 -- a plan for a huge expansion of the school's Greenwich Village campus as well as additional buildings in other parts of the city, including downtown Brooklyn.
The project has roused fierce opposition in the Village, which has largely been belittled or ignored. In Mr. Sexton's view, N.Y.U.'s angry neighbors just can't see that ''universities need to grow to maintain excellence,'' as he said recently. Newspaper editorials have dismissed the plan's opponents as a small but loud minority of ''Luddites'' and ''anti-building zealots.'' 
Such mockery vastly understates the opposition. As was quite clear at the packed and raucous public hearings earlier this year, Village residents are overwhelmingly opposed to it -- and so, in fact, is N.Y.U.'s own faculty. We see this project as a clear and present danger to the neighborhood and a grave risk to the university itself.
As of April 25, 23 faculty departments -- including economics, history, politics, mathematics, anthropology, art history, sociology and English -- have passed resolutions strongly urging Mr. Sexton to drop the plan, all of them unanimous or nearly so.
Why do we oppose it? On one hand, we share the personal fears of the community at risk, since many of us live there. The plan targets the area bounded by West Third Street, Houston Street, Mercer Street and LaGuardia Place, where two apartment complexes, Silver Towers and Washington Square Village, house more than 2,000 families -- including 40 percent of the faculty. The project would put all of us through 20 years (or more) of demolition and construction. Roughly two acres of green space would be destroyed, including the acclaimed Sasaki Garden, and in the end, four giant buildings would be crammed into the area, three placed smack against the older buildings, blocking most of the apartments from the sun. With the whole area rezoned for commercial use, there will be lots of stores, and a hotel.
What about N.Y.U. itself? First, the plan is a financial risk. The administration won't reveal its business plan, but according to N.Y.U.'s Web site, the plan will cost an estimated $6 billion. The debt service alone could strain N.Y.U.'s annual budget. A $2 billion loan, for instance, would mean more than $100 million a year in interest. How will we cover that new debt? Tuition increases? More students? Bigger classes? Unlike Yale or Harvard, we have no large endowment to cushion yearly drops in income. Most of N.Y.U.'s income comes from tuition -- a dicey strategy today.
Nationwide, costs of tuition and fees have more than doubled since 2000. Most students take out loans to pay their way -- and struggle more and more to pay them back. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, more than a quarter of indebted students are in arrears. Now that outstanding United States student debt has topped $1 trillion -- more than the entire population's credit-card debt -- that bubble could finally pop.
But it's not just risky to finance this project with more student debt. It's also wrong. Our graduates are among the most indebted in the nation. We'd rather see such misery ended than prolonged. This brings us to the academic impact. While Mr. Sexton has said often that his plan will make N.Y.U. strong, it will very likely have the opposite effect. This expansion of the university will eventually degrade our student body. Many of our best students have come from poor and middle-income families. If N.Y.U. must raise tuition to handle all that extra debt, applicants with money will be favored over those without. And if we need more students to defray our costs, we must be that much less selective.
The project will degrade our faculty at once. Like Columbia and Rockefeller, N.Y.U. has drawn top faculty members to this expensive city by offering affordable -- and livable -- housing. If this plan proceeds, many of our best will move to schools that would not house their employees on construction sites. We who are supposed to hire new talent either have to scare top candidates away by telling them the truth or get them here by keeping mum.
And as top faculty members depart, or stay away, fewer bright college seniors will be drawn to graduate school at N.Y.U.
What, then, does this project have to do with education? That N.Y.U. needs space is a reality. That universities must grow to maintain excellence is a delusion. As faculty members who care about our mission at this university, we are obliged to tell the difference.

HEADLINE: Viacom Signs A New Lease To Expand In Times Sq.

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI

 BODY:
Viacom Inc., the entertainment conglomerate that owns MTV, Comedy Central, Nickelodeon and Paramount Pictures, is expanding its presence in Times Square with one of the largest leases signed in New York City.
The company signed a deal this week that would let it stamp its name on the 54-story skyscraper that it occupies at 1515 Broadway, between 44th and 45th Streets, and ultimately to take over all of the space in the tower.
The deal was noteworthy for its size and its timing. The Midtown Manhattan office market has been in the doldrums for months as the vacancy rate has risen -- a reflection, in part, of economic uncertainty and layoffs by financial companies. 
It also closes widespread speculation in the real estate industry that Viacom, which has made its corporate home in Times Square for two decades, might move downtown to the World Financial Center or the World Trade Center when its lease expired in 2015.
After first threatening to relocate in 2008, Viacom renewed its lease for five years. This year, it began another search.
Now, Viacom is committing to take over the entire building as old tenants move out, increasing its space to 1.6 million square feet from 1.4 million.
''New York City is the undisputed media capital of the world and a vibrant source of inspiration for Viacom's innovative and creative employees,'' the company's chief executive, Philippe Dauman, said in a statement released on Wednesday.
The deal is a victory for SL Green Realty Corporation, which owns 1515 Broadway. Independent of the lease, the company also refinanced the tower for $775 million based on having doubled the net income since it bought the building 10 years ago.
''It is an enormously positive transaction for the city,'' said Marc Holliday, chief executive of SL Green, ''when a company like Viacom makes a long-term commitment to maintain its headquarters right in the heart of Times Square.''
With Viacom now out of the market, developers are focusing on media and technology companies like Time Warner, rather than financial companies, as a possible anchor tenant for a new office tower they are all eager to build, whether it is in Midtown, downtown or on the Far West Side.
Last year, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, the chief executive of Time Warner, expressed his desire to consolidate the company's operations, which include HBO, Time Inc., Warner Brothers and CNN, in new quarters by 2017. He described the company's current headquarters at the Time Warner Center as ''indulgent'' and said he hoped to save tens of millions of dollars by moving.
Earlier this month, Time Warner's real estate broker, Studley, asked roughly a dozen developers to submit preliminary proposals for from one million to three million square feet of office space. The developer Larry Silverstein submitted information about the towers he is building at the World Trade Center, while Brookfield proposed either the World Financial Center downtown, or, better yet, the company's large development site across Ninth Avenue from the Farley Post Office.
Alloy Development, in a partnership with Boston Properties, threw its West Side site, between 35th and 36th Streets, into the mix. And separately, Boston Properties, in partnership with Related Companies and Extell Development, offered an office site on Eighth Avenue at 45th Street. Extell also submitted plans for a tower on 11th Avenue, opposite the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.
Related, which built the Time Warner Center, has also proposed building a new headquarters for Time Warner at the southwest corner of 33rd Street and 10th Avenue, as part of its 26-acre Hudson Yards project. Related has told city officials that it plans to start work on a new headquarters for Coach in October on a site nearby.
But Time Warner is moving slowly. It is expected to review the preliminary proposals and narrow the list before asking for formal proposals. Developers say a final decision may not come until the end of the year.

HEADLINE: South Sudan To Get Aid From China; No Oil Deal

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Bree Feng contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China has welcomed the president of South Sudan and agreed to provide bank loans and humanitarian aid, but it has stopped short of moving forward on an oil pipeline, a sign of the delicate position Beijing finds itself in as the biggest energy investor in both the new nation of South Sudan and its bitter foe, Sudan.
As the two new nations continued to edge toward outright war this week and Salva Kiir, the president of South Sudan, cut short his trip to China, the government here urged both sides to use international mediation. 
Before oil-rich Sudan was partitioned into two countries last year, China financed the pipelines and refineries in the north to carry and process the oil that largely lies in the south.
Energy analysts say Sudanese oil makes up only 3 to 4 percent of China's total oil imports, but China, traditionally reluctant to get involved in foreign disputes, is now at the center of attention in a looming conflict between two developing countries that depend on its economic largess.
A new Chinese special envoy, Zhong Jianhua, a former ambassador to South Africa, visited Sudan and South Sudan last month as China tried to maintain neutrality.
The United States also has a special envoy, Princeton Lyman, a former ambassador to South Africa, and the two diplomats have been in touch, a senior Chinese official said Wednesday.
''We hope the China-United States cooperation will pay off,'' said Cui Tiankai, a vice foreign minister, at a briefing at the Foreign Ministry in Beijing.
In the 1990s, when China first invested in Sudan as a source of oil, Beijing cultivated a close relationship with President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, who has been charged by the International Criminal Court with orchestrating genocide in Darfur.
The United States scorned Mr. Bashir but maintained close ties with the rebels in southern Sudan, and supported the breakaway province's claim to statehood.
Mr. Kiir's visit to China showed that Beijing was seeking to secure and expand its footprint in South Sudan's oil sector, said Zach Vertin, senior analyst on Sudan and South Sudan for the International Crisis Group in Nairobi, Kenya. The China National Petroleum Corporation is the primary Chinese operator in South Sudan, Mr. Vertin said.
South Sudan stopped producing oil in late January after it accused Sudan of stealing some of its oil meant for export. The tensions have since erupted into violence, with Sudanese war planes dropping bombs and South Sudanese forces rushing in at one point to occupy an oil-producing region, Heglig, in Sudan.
As a chief partner to the warring sides, China has also found itself a target.
In January, 29 Chinese workers involved in building a $63 million road financed by the Export-Import Bank of China were abducted by rebels in the oil-rich region of South Kordofan Province in Sudan.
In February, South Sudan, angered that China was not sufficiently on its side, expelled the president of the Chinese oil consortium based in Juba, the capital of South Sudan.
Mr. Kiir's trip to Beijing was interpreted as an effort, in part, to secure financing for a pipeline that South Sudan would like to build through Kenya to a port on the Indian Ocean. The new route would give South Sudan's oil access to a port other than Port Sudan, located on the Red Sea, the main exit point for oil from the south.
China would be a logical financier for such a pipeline, said Li Xinfeng, a researcher at the Institute of West Asian and African Studies at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. But any decision by China would be made on a commercial, not political, basis, he said.
While the visit of Mr. Kiir showed that China was interested in improving its relationship with South Sudan, Beijing did not want to appear to be taking sides by announcing a major pipeline investment as the two countries seemed headed for war.

HEADLINE: In Milan, Plush Reality

BYLINE: By JULIE LASKY

 BODY:
SOME of the most thought-provoking ideas at the International Furniture Fair in Milan, which ended on Sunday, issued not from the thousands of exhibition booths and off-site venues or even from the lips of the designers, pundits and producers who bring this stalwart city to life every April. They were written on the walls.
''Thanks Starck,'' read one such message, scrawled in the neighborhood of Ventura Lambrate, where for the third consecutive year emerging designers have shown work and staged Oedipal battles with the masters. The words accompanied a drawing of Philippe Starck's Juicy Salif lemon squeezer from 1990, an aluminum teardrop on spidery legs with a knob intended for mauling citrus -- but the artist had substituted a toilet paper roll for the lemon.
Such an irreverent treatment of a classic object suggests that Mr. Starck may have lost his mojo in today's design world, but he shows no sign of receding from the scene. On the contrary, his notoriously paradoxical nature defined this year's fair, which was marked by the contradictory pursuits of social consciousness and unrestrained luxury. 
Mr. Starck may be best known for a whimsical $100 sculpture that does nothing more than extract juice. But he also is -- or claims to be -- as idealistic as any young designer.
He alternately caters to lovers of luxury and slaps them on the wrist. This year, he collaborated with Lenny Kravitz on upholstered versions of his Mademoiselle chair for the high-end Italian company Kartell, but he also touted his Broom chair for the American company Emeco, made of 90 percent recycled post-industrial factory waste and 10 percent glass. ''With this new chair, I start to feel happy,'' he said in a promotional film for the product, ''because it is made of nothing.''
A decade ago, socially conscious design was a sideshow at the fair, but now it's in the center ring. A number of companies boasted of earth-friendly materials and showed off efficient packing methods that reduced their carbon footprints. The Swedish company Offecct went so far as to display Luca Nichetto's Robo chair from 2010 along with its box to show how compactly it can be taken apart and shipped.
Food was a popular medium for commentary. In Lambrate, Rui Pereira and Ryosuke Fukusada baked tiny cakes shaped like chairs, lamps and vases to protest the hyperabundance of new furniture and the inability of consumers to ''digest'' it. And in the Tortona district, Marleen Jansen presented her Seesaw Table, which requires two diners to sit down to meals and depart from the table at precisely the same time -- or else risk sending one of the pair flying.
''It's a courtesy table,'' Ms. Jansen said. ''I want to manipulate behavior, and it's rude to leave the table while eating.''
On the frontiers of experimentation, the ''Open Design Archipelago'' exhibition organized by Domus magazine and Audi demonstrated methods for harnessing the desert sun to melt sand and produce glass objects; for manufacturing inexpensive chairs with a robotic arm (no human hands needed); and for training crows to pick up bottle caps littering the landscape.
And yet, while there were plenty of designers trying to redirect human habits and prepare for a world with scarce resources, many conventional products seemed to have gotten bigger and softer, assuming a standard of padded comfort one might even call American.
Furniture came with names like Soft Box, the Swiss designer Alfred Haberli's cushy sofa for Moroso. And the body-cradling Bunny armchair by Iskos-Berlin, for the Danish company Normann Copenhagen, was all but infantilizing.
But nothing conveyed the sensuality of textiles (or their facsimile) this year so much as the flowing tablecloth carved into the wood of Ferruccio Laviani's Twaya table for Emmemobili. A representative of the Italian company Emmemobili noted that, by the end of the fair, the number of hands rubbing the table's surface had left ''the left side smoother than the right.''
ACTS of aesthetic indulgence seemed to compensate for the fact that Southern Europe's economy was in tatters. Several onlookers suggested that Italy's recent austerity measures had whetted the appetite for comfort. Others attributed bigger furniture to an obesity epidemic. Beyond dispute is that European producers are catering to the tastes of prosperous foreigners in South America, Russia, India and East Asia, many of whom value the look and feel of luxury.
FederlegnoArredo, an Italian furniture industry association that is a sponsor of the Milan Furniture Fair, reported a decrease of 9.7 percent in local purchases between 2010 and 2011, but an increase of 4.3 percent in exports. And Claudio Luti, president of Kartell, noted that ''last year was the worst for the industry, but we profited,'' citing the company's 127 stores throughout the world, including seven in China.
''Business is very difficult, very bumpy,'' said Rossana Orlandi, whose sprawling Milanese design gallery was filled with such marvels as the Surface Tension Lamp, a continually inflating and popping soap bubble surrounding an LED designed by Front for Booo Studio in the Netherlands. ''We are lucky because we have plenty of foreign customers, but the mood is very depressing.''
Still, given the crowds stuffed into booths and the lavish displays by international furniture producers and materials suppliers, it took a discerning eye to detect adversity.
Superstudio Piu, an exhibition space in Tortona, for instance, presented nine massive sculptures created by prominent designers at the invitation of the Turkish stone industry. Mr. Haberli, who was a participant, said he was given few constraints in fashioning a pavilion built from several varieties of marble and that the cost was about $100,000 for materials and construction alone, forget shipping.
Far from wearing its charms openly, Milan usually hides its treasures behind blistered, mustard-colored walls. But this fair was notable for penetrating a number of eye-popping sites that would have been off-limits or simply invisible to the casual visitor.
The clothing labels Blumarine and Roberto Cavalli both introduced home collections, and Cavalli's was displayed in an ornate old home on Corso Venezia. (No photographs, visitors were warned, lest the flash bulbs disturb the Canaletto paintings.) Intricate parquet floors and coffered ceilings set off a bed upholstered in buttery leather and covered with a velvet-lined fur throw. Glittering Murano glass balls lacked any discernible function other than to look impressive heaped on a dining table.
And Meissen furnished the 16th-century Casa Carcola-Grandi on Via Montenapelone with a sumptuous assortment of furniture, lighting, textiles and jewelry -- brave new territory for the 300-year-old German porcelain company. There, a proffered bed was displayed under a fresco painted by Raphael's students. Meissen even produced the mattress.
Most likely, fairgoers would not have set foot in the National Museum of Science and Technology Leonardo da Vinci either, were it not for the British designer Tom Dixon. Mr. Dixon organized several exhibitions in the museum complex -- which is housed in a former monastery and a train station -- with displays placed around an immense courtyard and among antique locomotives and planes. Another path led to ''The Secret Garden,'' an installation designed by Paola Navone and Zaha Hadid that featured Barovier & Toso glass chandeliers suspended in twiggy blue yurts in the botanical gardens of the Brera neighborhood.
But even attendees who chose not to seek out obscure corners of Milan could walk down a corridor and see the world. The fair has never stretched so far internationally or represented so many transcontinental partnerships. A few examples: INCH, a furniture company that showed refined wood shelving and tables, works in close collaboration with Indonesian designers, although its founders are based in Switzerland. Paola C. presented wood tabletop objects designed by Aldo Cibic, of Italy, and Bijoy Jain, of India, carved in Mr. Jain's workshop near Mumbai.
And at the Salone Satellite, an exhibition of young designers' work now in its 15th year, Francesca Lanzavecchia and Hunn Wai, a former couple -- she from Milan, he from Singapore -- showed products to assist the elderly: canes attached to rolling carts, chairs that help propel sitters into a standing position.
''People appreciate beautiful things,'' Ms. Lanzavecchia said. ''Why should they be degraded by old age?''
Ms. Orlandi, the Milanese gallery owner, offered a final word on this year's offerings. Surrounded by mobs of fairgoers in her gallery's garden one afternoon, she peered through her signature owl-like glasses and announced, ''Particularly now, a product has to be honest, concrete, beautiful.''
She paused to puff on a cigarette. ''I should say only one word: honest,'' she amended. ''We don't need other words.''
Nendo, Nendo Everywhere
THE scale of the Milan Furniture Fair -- 5.7 million square feet of exhibition space in the main fairgrounds alone -- would seem to ensure that no single design studio could stand out in the crowd. But this year, the Tokyo-based Nendo, which was founded in 2002 by Oki Sato, now 34, seemed to be everywhere.
On Via della Spiga, the Nilufar gallery showed tiny bowls made of glued sheets of paper lacquered and sanded to resemble wood. At Spazio Rossana Orlandi, LED-illuminated glass bulbs to which the blowers' pipes remained attached dangled from a chandelier produced by Lasvit. At Moroso's booth in Rho, thick white canvas looked tossed over the backs of metal-frame sofas and chairs: meet the upholstery. And at Established & Sons' display on Via Savona, a desk lamp called Hood tilted forward like a hawk. Nearby, bath fixtures for Bisazza in pale larch and gleaming white serenely dotted the space.
Nendo, all Nendo.
The bath collection was typically restrained. Bisazza produces glass tiles in flamboyant hues, but Mr. Sato chose transparent tiles for his mosaics, which he combined with Carrera marble to create a pattern of Japanese and European flowers. (He was raised in Canada until the age of 10 and routinely mixes East and West.)
''Transparency is not only making things disappear,'' he said. ''When things disappear, you notice light and texture.''
Nasir Kassamali, the chief executive of Luminaire, a furniture store in Coral Gables, Fla., praised Mr. Sato's precise eyes for proportions. ''There's minimalism,'' he said. ''And then there's intelligent minimalism.''
A New Source of Lighting Catches On
THE pioneering German designer Ingo Maurer has worked with the thin, flexible lighting elements known as OLEDs -- or organic light-emitting diodes, which use organic compounds that produce light in response to electrical current -- since 2005. But only in 2008 did he introduce a lighting product that used the technology: a limited-edition table lamp called Early Future, which had five OLED panels extending like wings from either side of an angled stem. The cost of the lamp: $10,000.
Four years later, OLEDs are cheaper, longer-lasting and gaining visibility. In Milan, the Japanese company Lumiotec presented a dramatic installation designed by Naohiko Mitsu, which mixed OLEDs and LEDs. And in celebration of its 50th anniversary, Flos presented the limited-edition Light Photon lamp, a table lamp designed by Philippe Starck that consists of a giant OLED backed by a mirrored surface, on a stainless steel base. OLEDs were also spotted at the Salone Satellite show for emerging designers.
Asked about the technology today, Mr. Maurer is reserved. ''Everyone thought this was going to be a gold mine, but it has a long way to go,'' he said. ''It makes a monotonous light, with no depth, no dimension. I hope we don't have a future only with OLEDs but with other light sources.''
Such as? ''Incandescent light,'' he said with a twinkle. ''Fire.''

HEADLINE: Dewey & LeBoeuf Crisis Mirrors the Legal Industry's Woes

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
The crisis confronting the law firm Dewey & LeBoeuf has stunned the legal profession. About 70 of Dewey's 300 partners have left since January after their salaries were slashed because of the firm's weak financial performance.
Dewey's woes hardly surprise Michael H. Trotter, a partner at Taylor English Duma in Atlanta who, in addition to a five-decade career as a corporate lawyer, has written two books about the economics and management of law firms.
After graduating from Harvard Law School in 1962, Mr. Trotter began his career as an associate at the predecessor firm to Alston & Bird. His first book, ''Profit and the Practice of Law'' (University of Georgia Press, 1997), chronicled the growth and changes in the field from 1960 to 1995. His latest, ''Declining Prospects,'' will be released next month by Create Space, a self-publishing program owned by Amazon.com.
In an interview, Mr. Trotter, 75, discussed the Dewey case and the broader problems facing many of the country's largest law firms. 
Q.
The publication of ''Declining Prospects'' comes at a moment when Dewey faces the risk of collapse. The turmoil at the firm appears to be a manifestation of a lot of the issues that you discuss in your book.
A.
I don't think Dewey's problems are just a matter of a management mistake here or there but instead reflect a change in the fundamental competitive environment in the legal services industry. Many of the larger firms that serve major business clients are caught up in these changes. We've already seen several go under, and I think we'll see quite a few more over the next few years.
Q.
What has changed?
A.
There are now far more capable lawyers and law firms than there is work for them to do. The financial costs of legal services have gotten so high that most clients are determined to reduce them. Many legal services have become commodities that can be supplied by a large number of firms with sufficient quality to meet the needs of most clients in most situations, and corporate general counsel now know that they can get what they need at a lower cost if they force the major firms to compete for the work.
Q.
One reason for Dewey's trouble is that it poached lawyers from rival firms by offering them multiyear, multimillion-dollar guaranteed contracts.
A.
That's a very risky strategy. For one thing, people don't always produce what they promise; often not all the clients that they currently have move with them, so to give anyone a guaranteed contract based on their past success is basically a mistake. Imagine the environment where profits are dropping and there are some partners getting the full amount they were guaranteed and you're getting half of what you expected. It generates a lot of hard feelings.
Q.
A few chapters of your latest book are devoted to the working conditions at big law firms. You describe a grim environment.
A.
Law firms expect associates to put in 1,800 to 2,000 billable hours, and at some firms it's up to 2,500. That's 50 hours a week, 50 weeks a year. And that's just the billable time. Every lawyer has to make an investment every day of time that's not billable. You have to study and learn, improve your skills, administer to your practice. If you're working 50 hours a week of billable time, you're probably working 65 to 70 hours of total time. So the burden is tremendous. Now, with the Internet and cellphones, you're in demand possibly every hour of every day of every week.
Q.
But haven't these issues been around for years? Big law firms became big businesses a long time ago, and some will say you're just an out-of-touch, bow-tie-wearing Southern lawyer romanticizing the practice and yearning for the days of Atticus Finch.
A.
I'm mostly reporting the feeling and attitudes that are widespread in the profession rather than my own views. The American Bar Association has concluded that lawyers at every level are unhappy with the transformation of the profession to a business and were leaving the profession in droves. And many are unhappy with their careers and their lives. I'm not against lawyers having profitable careers; I've had one myself. What ''Declining Prospects'' says is that our capitalistic system will adjust economic imbalances and develop more cost-effective ways of delivering legal services.
Q.
What does the practice of corporate law look like five years from now?
A.
We will continue to see the growth and importance of corporate law departments. The firms that are doing the commodity work, the fairly standardized stuff that any one of a number of firms could do, are going to see more of their work move in-house. It's estimated that the full cost of using outside counsel is 35 to 50 percent higher than the cost of doing their own legal work. And there are advantages in terms of controlling their time, making the in-house services more effective. That means the leverage that law firms have utilized to generate profits will go down and they aren't going to need as many associates.
Q.
Would you encourage your grandchildren to go to law school?
A.
I would not. It's extraordinarily competitive. We are turning out 45,000 or so law school graduates a year. The quality is very high, and there aren't jobs for them. Roughly half the lawyers in the country are sole practitioners. Seventy percent practice in firms with fewer than 20 lawyers, and for the most part they do not have the very high levels of income enjoyed by the major firms. Making a go requires three years of your life and $150,000 for a legal education. If you get a job at an elite firm, the odds of becoming a partner are probably less than 10 percent. So, it's a very rough row to hoe, and much of the work that's done is not challenging and interesting work.
Q.
After 50 years of practice, you have a rather dim view of your profession.
A.
My generation has been able to ride the wave of change and stay ahead of it, which has enabled me and many others to enjoy our careers. For some time now and into the future, I fear it will be much more difficult for most major business practice lawyers to maintain the high levels of compensation they have enjoyed without further sacrificing the quality of their lives and the satisfaction that they derive from the practice of law. Indeed, the danger is that compensation will decline but the present rigors of law practice will remain unabated or increase.

 CORRECTION:
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An interview on the DealBook page on Thursday with Michael H. Trotter, an author of two books about the economics and management of law firms, omitted two words in an answer by Mr. Trotter to a question about a practice of recruiting lawyers by offering them guaranteed contracts. Mr. Trotter said: ''That's a very risky strategy. For one thing, people don't always produce what they promise; often not all the clients that they currently have move with them, so to give anyone a guaranteed contract based on their past success is basically a mistake.'' (The words ''not all'' were omitted.)

9:30 P.M. (NBC) PARKS AND RECREATION Amy Poehler wrote and directed this episode, in which her character, Leslie, finally goes against Bobby Newport (the guest star Paul Rudd, above, with Ms. Poehler), her chief campaign rival, in a televised debate. The Thursday night comedy lineup begins with ''Community,'' at 8, in which the study group, after discovering that its yam experiment has been sabotaged in the science lab, goes in search of the perpetrator for a mock trial presided over by Professor Kane (Michael K. Williams). In a live broadcast of ''30 Rock,'' at 8:30, Kenneth (Jack McBrayer) tries to convince his Kabletown bosses, as well as Liz (Tina Fey) and Jack (Alec Baldwin), that ''TGS'' should remain a live show. And in ''The Office,'' at 9, an unemployed Andy (Ed Helms) crashes a fund-raiser for Senator Lipton (Jack Coleman) and ends up adopting 12 disabled dogs.
11:15 A.M. (Sundance) BLUE BLOOD (2007) Stevan Riley follows the boxers who made the 2005 Oxford University Amateur Boxing Club varsity squad as they fight their peers at Cambridge, a rivalry that has existed for more than 100 years. 
2:15 P.M. (IFC) CURSE OF THE GOLDEN FLOWER (2006) A cruel emperor (Chow Yun-Fat, below) and his secretive wife (Gong Li) plot each other's annihilation: he by destroying her sanity with a rare fungus; she by planning a bloody coup during a festival and persuading one of her three sons (Jay Chou) to join her revolt. Writing in The New York Times, Jeannette Catsoulis said that this martial-arts drama from the director Zhang Yimou, set in A.D. 928, ''achieves a kind of operatic delirium, opening the floodgates of image and melodrama until the line between tragedy and black comedy is all but erased.''
2:25 P.M. (HBO2) GLORIA: IN HER OWN WORDS (2011) After making headlines as a journalist in the 1960s in New York City with an expose on the working conditions of Playboy Bunnies, Gloria Steinem felt her political ideals expanding when she covered an abortion hearing for New York magazine in 1969 and learned of the horrifying experiences women had endured while trying to exercise reproductive rights. (Ms. Steinem kept secret the abortion she'd had at 22.) On Aug. 26, 1970, she helped lead the Women's Strike for Equality on the 50th anniversary of the enactment of women's suffrage. By 1972 she had co-founded Ms. Magazine, beginning her ascent as a public face of feminism. This documentary from Peter Kunhardt chronicles Ms. Steinem's life through interviews and archival footage. Topics include her childhood in Toledo, Ohio; the inspiration for her work; her battle with breast cancer; and her late-in-life marriage and subsequent widowhood. Barbara Walters, Helen Gurley Brown, Phil Donahue and Larry King weigh in.

HEADLINE: Strong Profits on Wall St., And Markets Move Higher

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
Stocks advanced on Wednesday, giving the Nasdaq 100 index its biggest gain this year, as Apple's earnings almost doubled and the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said the Fed was prepared to do more to stimulate growth.
Apple surged 8.9 percent for the biggest gain since November 2008. Boeing added 5.3 percent as earnings beat estimates after the company delivered more commercial jets while pushing production to record levels. Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of construction equipment, slumped 4.6 percent as revenue missed projections. 
The Nasdaq composite index rose 68.03 points, or 2.30 percent, to 3,029.63. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 18.72 points, or 1.36 percent, to 1,390.69. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 89.16 points, or 0.69 percent, to 13,090.72.
''It's encouraging,'' James Swanson, chief investment strategist at MFS Investment Management in Boston, said in a telephone interview. ''The earnings season shows that companies can have good profitability in a low-growth environment. As long as these earnings hold up, I'd say that's a bright sign for the market.''
The S.& P. 500 has risen 11 percent in 2012 on better-than-estimated economic and corporate data. Companies in the United States are beating earnings estimates at the highest rate in two years as growth at home helps counter a drag from Europe. Profits have topped forecasts at 80 percent of S.& P. 500 companies reporting since April 10.
Stocks also rallied as policy makers said they expected growth to gradually accelerate, while refraining from new actions to lower borrowing costs. Central bankers upgraded their forecasts for economic growth and unemployment while repeating their view that borrowing costs were likely to remain ''exceptionally low'' at least through late 2014.
''The Fed is providing an insurance policy to the economy,'' said Ann Miletti, senior portfolio manager for Wells Fargo Advantage Funds in Menomonee Falls, Wis. ''There's a sense that things are improving, yet there's some instability. The Fed is saying that it will be there to help keep things going. Earnings have been strong. The market likes it.''
Interest rates were slightly higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 3/32, to 100 8/32, and the yield rose to 1.99 percent from 1.97 percent late Tuesday.
All 10 groups in the S.& P. 500-stock index rallied, led by technology, which composes 20 percent of the index. The group jumped 3.2 percent, the biggest advance since November. The Morgan Stanley cyclical index of companies most tied to the economy increased 1.6 percent. The Russell 2000 index of small companies rallied 1.8 percent to 812.12.
Apple surged 8.9 percent to $610. The chief executive, Timothy D. Cook, said there would be ''a lot more opportunity'' in China as the company expanded operations there.
Boeing gained 5.3 percent to $77.08. It shipped 137 jetliners last quarter, compared with 131 deliveries by its main rival, Airbus.
Coca-Cola rose 1.1 percent to $74.93 after voting to recommend a 2-for-1 stock split to keep shares available to smaller investors.
Caterpillar slumped 4.6 percent, the most in the Dow, to $103.44. The company said sales in developing nations this year would be lower than anticipated.

HEADLINE: After Recalls and Missteps, J.&J.'s New Chief Confronts Critical Challenges

BYLINE: By KATIE THOMAS

 BODY:
Johnson & Johnson needs to rethink the way it brings drugs to market, expand its reach into global markets and rebuild consumer confidence by returning recalled brands to pharmacy shelves, the incoming chief executive, Alex Gorsky, said in an interview Wednesday.
Mr. Gorsky, who is scheduled to take over formally during Johnson & Johnson's annual meeting Thursday, did not lay out plans for major changes at the company, which has been troubled in recent years by a succession of product recalls, manufacturing problems and government inquiries. 
He said he intended to build on the company's long legacy of success. Still, he said, ''I think we're going to need to be bold, disciplined and decisive about how we go forward.''
Essential to the company's future, he said, was a rethinking how it develops new drugs. ''I think the markets are going to demand a higher bar around innovation and really making a difference for patients,'' he said.
Les Funtleyder, a portfolio manager at Miller Tabak & Company, agreed that Johnson & Johnson's research and development operation has been sluggish recently, failing to turn out as many profitable drugs and devices as it once did.
''It's more of a question of steering it back to where it was,'' said Mr. Funtleyder, whose fund owns the stock. ''I'm not sure you need a total redo. You need a course correction.''
Mr. Gorsky also sees major opportunities in global markets. Already, 55 percent of Johnson's sales come from overseas, but the company can do better, Mr. Gorsky said.
Developing markets, he said, are growing at three to five times the rate of markets like the United States and Europe. ''And as more people move into the middle class, they represent even more of an opportunity,'' Mr. Gorsky said.
There is no question that Mr. Gorsky, who is replacing William C. Weldon, has his work cut out for him. Consumer confidence in Johnson & Johnson, once one of the most trusted brands, has dipped in recent years as the company recalled dozens of products, including millions of bottles of children's Tylenol and other medications, as well as artificial hips and other products.
Last week, company officials told analysts that efforts to fix the manufacturing problems that had caused the recalls of over-the-counter brands were taking longer than expected, and that some brands might not return to shelves until 2013.
Mr. Gorsky said Wednesday that the company has made changes to its supply chain and quality control procedures and that working with a third-party firm as well as the Food and Drug Administration was taking a long time. ''We're learning as we go through this process,'' he said. ''We believe we're starting to see the benefits of some of that, but we still realize that there's work that we have to do.''
When the products return to shelves, Mr. Gorsky said he was confident that customers would continue to buy them. He said this has already happened with some returning brands. ''The events over the last couple of years have had a negative impact, but we've been, I think, encouraged by how resilient our brands and our company reputation has been,'' he said.
Mr. Gorsky, who is 51, joined Johnson & Johnson as a sales representative in 1988. He ran the company's pharmaceutical businesses in Europe, Africa and the Middle East, then left in 2004 to head the North American pharmaceuticals business at Novartis. He returned to Johnson & Johnson four years later.
Mr. Gorsky won the chief executive job over Sherilyn S. McCoy, who had led the pharmaceuticals and consumer groups, but resigned to become chief executive of Avon this week. Mr. Weldon will remain as chairman.
Manufacturing problems are not the only troubles that the company faces.
A judge in Alabama fined the company $1.2 billion over accusations that it had hidden and diminished the risks of Risperdal, an antipsychotic drug, and the company is facing similar lawsuits by state attorneys general across the country. The Alabama case is being appealed, and Mr. Gorsky declined to comment on the matter, citing the litigation.
He also declined to comment for similar reasons on his role in an artificial hip implant that has failed in thousands of patients, crippling some of them. Mr. Gorsky was head of the device and diagnostics group at the time that critical decisions were being made about the implants.
Although some have criticized Johnson & Johnson for hiring an insider to lead the company during a difficult time, Mr. Gorsky said he has a track record of taking decisive, sometimes counterintuitive, action. He described himself as a ''realistic optimist'' and cited as an example the company's decision last year to stop making drug-coated heart stents.
Recent research has shown that stents were overused and that drugs might be a better alternative to avoiding heart attacks or strokes. At the same time, he said, he chose to expand the company's orthopedics business by negotiating the deal to acquire Synthes, a medical device maker.
Of the decision on the heart stents, ''I think that represents the kind of decisiveness that we're going to need again, even in an area where I think that few would have felt that Johnson & Johnson would do that,'' he said. ''That's the realist in me.''

HEADLINE: Fall of Chinese Official Is Tied to Wiretapping Of His Fellow Leaders

BYLINE: By JONATHAN ANSFIELD and IAN JOHNSON; Edward Wong contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- When Hu Jintao, China's top leader, picked up the telephone last August to talk to a senior anticorruption official visiting Chongqing, special devices detected that he was being wiretapped -- by local officials in that southwestern metropolis.
The discovery of that and other wiretapping led to an official investigation that helped topple Chongqing's charismatic leader, Bo Xilai, in a political cataclysm that has yet to reach a conclusion.
Until now, the downfall of Mr. Bo has been cast largely as a tale of a populist who pursued his own agenda too aggressively for some top leaders in Beijing and was brought down by accusations that his wife had arranged the murder of Neil Heywood, a British consultant, after a business dispute. But the hidden wiretapping, previously alluded to only in internal Communist Party accounts of the scandal, appears to have provided another compelling reason for party leaders to turn on Mr. Bo.
The story of how China's president was monitored also shows the level of mistrust among leaders in the one-party state. To maintain control over society, leaders have embraced enhanced surveillance technology. But some have turned it on one another -- repeating patterns of intrigue that go back to the beginnings of Communist rule. 
''This society has bred mistrust and violence,'' said Roderick MacFarquhar, a historian of Communist China's elite-level machinations over the past half century. ''Leaders know you have to watch your back because you never know who will put a knife in it.''
Nearly a dozen people with party ties, speaking anonymously for fear of retribution, confirmed the wiretapping, as well as a widespread program of bugging across Chongqing. But the party's public version of Mr. Bo's fall omits it.
The official narrative and much foreign attention has focused on the more easily grasped death of Mr. Heywood in November. When Mr. Bo's police chief, Wang Lijun, was stripped of his job and feared being implicated in Bo family affairs, he fled to the United States Consulate in Chengdu, where he spoke mostly about Mr. Heywood's death.
The murder account is pivotal to the scandal, providing Mr. Bo's opponents with an unassailable reason to have him removed. But party insiders say the wiretapping was seen as a direct challenge to central authorities. It revealed to them just how far Mr. Bo, who is now being investigated for serious disciplinary violations, was prepared to go in his efforts to grasp greater power in China. That compounded suspicions that Mr. Bo could not be trusted with a top slot in the party, which is due to reshuffle its senior leadership positions this fall.
''Everyone across China is improving their systems for the purposes of maintaining stability,'' said one official with a central government media outlet, referring to surveillance tactics. ''But not everyone dares to monitor party central leaders.''
According to senior party members, including editors, academics and people with ties to the military, Mr. Bo's eavesdropping operations began several years ago as part of a state-financed surveillance buildup, ostensibly for the purposes of fighting crime and maintaining local political stability.
The architect was Mr. Wang, a nationally decorated crime fighter who had worked under Mr. Bo in the northeast province of Liaoning. Together they installed ''a comprehensive package bugging system covering telecommunications to the Internet,'' according to the government media official.
One of several noted cybersecurity experts they enlisted was Fang Binxing, president of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, who is often called the father of China's ''Great Firewall,'' the nation's vast Internet censorship system. Most recently, Mr. Fang advised the city on a new police information center using cloud-based computing, according to state news media reports. Late last year, Mr. Wang was named a visiting professor at Mr. Fang's university.
Together, Mr. Bo and Mr. Wang unleashed a drive to smash what they said were crime rings that controlled large portions of Chongqing's economic life. In interviews, targets of the crackdown marveled at the scale and determination with which local police intercepted their communications.
''On the phone, we dared not mention Bo Xilai or Wang Lijun,'' said Li Jun, a fugitive property developer who now lives in hiding abroad. Instead, he and fellow businessmen took to scribbling notes, removing their cellphone batteries and stocking up on unregistered SIM cards to thwart surveillance as the crackdown mounted, he said.
Li Zhuang, a lawyer from a powerfully connected Beijing law firm, recalled how some cousins of one client had presented him with a full stack of unregistered mobile phone SIM cards, warning him of local wiretapping. Despite these precautions, the Chongqing police ended up arresting Mr. Li on the outskirts of Beijing, about 900 miles away, after he called his client's wife and arranged to visit her later that day at a hospital.
''They already were there lying in ambush,'' Mr. Li said. He added that Wang Lijun, by reputation, was a ''tapping freak.''
Political figures were targeted in addition to those suspected of being mobsters.
One political analyst with senior-level ties, citing information obtained from a colonel he recently dined with, said Mr. Bo had tried to tap the phones of virtually all high-ranking leaders who visited Chongqing in recent years, including Zhou Yongkang, the law-and-order czar who was said to have backed Mr. Bo as his potential successor.
''Bo wanted to be extremely clear about what leaders' attitudes toward him were,'' the analyst said.
In one other instance last year, two journalists said, operatives were caught intercepting a conversation between the office of Mr. Hu and Liu Guanglei, a top party law-and-order official whom Mr. Wang had replaced as police chief. Mr. Liu once served under Mr. Hu in the 1980s in Guizhou Province.
Perhaps more worrisome to Mr. Bo and Mr. Wang, however, was the increased scrutiny from the party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, which by the beginning of 2012 had stationed up to four separate teams in Chongqing, two undercover, according to the political analyst, who cited Discipline Inspection sources. One line of inquiry, according to several party academics, involved Mr. Wang's possible role in a police bribery case that unfolded last year in a Liaoning city where he once was police chief.
Beyond making a routine inspection, it is not clear why the disciplinary official who telephoned Mr. Hu -- Ma Wen, the minister of supervision -- was in Chongqing. Her high-security land link to Mr. Hu from the state guesthouse in Chongqing was monitored on Mr. Bo's orders. The topic of the call is unknown but was probably not vital. Most phones are so unsafe that important information is often conveyed only in person or in writing.
But Beijing was galled that Mr. Bo would wiretap Mr. Hu, whether intentionally or not, and turned central security and disciplinary investigators loose on his police chief, who bore the brunt of the scrutiny over the next couple of months.
''Bo wanted to push the responsibility onto Wang,'' one senior party editor said. ''Wang couldn't dare say it was Bo's doing.''
Yet at some point well before fleeing Chongqing, Mr. Wang filed a pair of complaints to the inspection commission, the first anonymously and the second under his own name, according to a party academic with ties to Mr. Bo.
Both complaints said Mr. Bo had ''opposed party central'' authorities, including ordering the wiretapping of central leaders. The requests to investigate Mr. Bo were turned down at the time. Mr. Bo, who learned of the charges at a later point, told the academic shortly before his dismissal that he thought he could withstand Mr. Wang's charges.
Mr. Wang is not believed to have discussed wiretapping at the United States Consulate. Instead, he focused on the less self-incriminating allegations of Mr. Bo's wife's arranging the killing of Mr. Heywood.
But tensions between the two men crested, sources said, when Mr. Bo found that Mr. Wang had also wiretapped him and his wife. After Mr. Wang was arrested in February, Mr. Bo detained Mr. Wang's wiretapping specialist from Liaoning, a district police chief named Wang Pengfei.
Internal party accounts suggest that the party views the wiretapping as one of Mr. Bo's most serious crimes. One preliminary indictment in mid-March accused Bo of damaging party unity by collecting evidence on other leaders.
Party officials, however, say it would be far too damaging to make the wiretapping public. When Mr. Bo is finally charged, wiretapping is not expected to be mentioned. ''The things that can be publicized are the economic problems and the killing,'' according to the senior official at the government media outlet. ''That's enough to decide the matter in public.''

HEADLINE: In Shift, Mexico to Review Wal-Mart Permits

BYLINE: By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD; Karla Zabludovsky and Elisabeth Malkin contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- Two days after declaring it would not investigate bribery allegations tied to Wal-Mart's rapid expansion in Mexico, the Mexican government said Wednesday that it would review permits related to the approval of stores and seek information from American authorities. 
The announcement came two days after Mexico's economic ministry said the government had no jurisdiction in the matter because state and local agencies had issued the permits and zoning approvals for the company, now Mexico's largest private retailer and employer.
But the administration of President Felipe Calderon, who has championed business development and in recent years had met frequently with the head of Wal-Mart's Mexico division, faced calls from lawmakers and good government groups to not let such bribery allegations be taken lightly.
The New York Times reported Sunday that Wal-Mart's own investigators had found evidence that Wal-Mart de Mexico had paid millions of dollars in bribes to speed approvals for its stores and then sought to cover up the payments.
The government tapped the office of the Secretary of Public Administration to review any federal permits and paperwork involved in opening the stores. A statement from the agency said it would turn over any evidence of wrongdoing to the appropriate authorities.
The agency, however, does not have a strong track record in rooting out corruption.
In 2009, Mr. Calderon had proposed eliminating the agency, which functions as a watchdog over federal public officials, as part of an austerity plan. Critics of the agency had said it was costly and failed to deliver results, but Congress blocked the move.
Wal-Mart presents a thorny problem for the government.
Mr. Calderon has celebrated Wal-Mart's growth in Mexico; since first entering the market here in 1991, the retailer has opened more than 2,100 stores and restaurants. In turn, Wal-Mart had taken steps to support Mr. Calderon's pet environmental causes, including promoting clean energy in its buildings.
Gerardo Esquivel, an economist at El Colegio de Mexico, a university, said he believed Mexico had reacted slowly to the bribery allegations and blamed confusion in the government over a tangle of federal, state and local laws that appeared to make the authority to investigate unclear.
''There was no coordinated reaction,'' he said. ''It was late, it was tepid.''

HEADLINE: At Disney, a Splintering of Power Makes It Tough to Find a Chief

BYLINE: By BROOKS BARNES

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS -- At a convention of movie theater owners here on Tuesday, Walt Disney Studios displayed plenty of fanfare, trotting out Johnny Depp to promote his 2013 remake of ''The Lone Ranger'' and hiring 11 bagpipe players to herald ''Brave,'' a film about a Scottish princess.
What the studio notably did not have on hand was a leader. Last week Rich Ross resigned under pressure as Disney's movie chairman. But no matter. The studio's powerful subchiefs, John Lasseter of Pixar, Kevin Feige of Marvel and Sean Bailey of live-action Disney movies, smoothly presented their slates of coming films.
Their presence, and Mr. Ross's absence, crystallized the difficult questions that confront Disney as it starts the arduous task of finding a new chairman, with no obvious candidates. Does running Walt Disney Studios require a brand manager, or a strong movie hand? 
Can Robert A. Iger, chief executive of the Walt Disney Company, find someone stronger than those division chiefs, a statesman who can navigate Hollywood's murderous upper ranks? Or will he turn to another air traffic controller like Mr. Ross, someone primarily charged with keeping the egos from clashing over release dates and shared marketing resources?
''It's either an incredibly powerful job or no job at all,'' said Harold Vogel, a media analyst and the author of ''Entertainment Industry Economics.'' ''That may speak to the unusual lack of candidates to succeed Ross.''
Mr. Vogel added, ''There used to be a time when people would kill for these jobs, but running a studio is not what it used to be.''
In the days of the great studio chiefs -- Louis B. Mayer, Lew Wasserman -- movie operations were still autonomous, allowing the executives in charge to wield absolute power. Even when consolidation swept deeper into Hollywood in the 1980s, studio chiefs still reigned supreme because, as Mr. Vogel put it, ''The movies were still big enough parts of the puzzle that they could sway the stock prices and earnings of the conglomerates that were buying them.''
Today, studios are embedded so deeply in media and technology giants like Sony and Viacom that their activities barely register on Wall Street. Disney had total revenue of $41 billion last year, but only $6.4 billion came from the studio. When Mr. Ross left, or even when Disney said last month that ''John Carter,'' one of the movies made on his watch, would require a $200 million write-down, the company's stock price remained stable.
As studios have become less prominent, the talent pool of executives competing to run them has also receded, analysts say. Silicon Valley has added to the problem. Why run a movie studio when you can build the next YouTube? Add the movie industry's difficulties -- a dying DVD business, shrinking attendance in North America, social media undermining traditional marketing techniques -- and the jobs are even less desirable.
When Mr. Iger last looked for a studio chairman, he had to turn to television. Mr. Ross had previously run Disney Channels Worldwide. But the challenge has not been unique to Disney. Faced in 2010 with finding a successor to Barry M. Meyer as chairman of Warner Brothers, Jeffrey L. Bewkes, chief executive of Time Warner, instead persuaded Mr. Meyer to postpone retirement until 2013.
Other studios, including Universal, have had problems finding top executives who have both creative and business credibility, two attributes that often do not coexist in one person.
But Disney does have one problem that is unique: its studio is organized in a way that makes the job of chairman unusually complicated.
Disney is set up to release about 15 movies a year, on par with Universal, 20th Century Fox and Paramount. But most of those movies come from units that primarily run independently, except for their distribution and marketing. Those units are Pixar, Marvel and a partnership with Steven Spielberg's DreamWorks Studios. Disney's live-action label is set up to make five or six movies a year.
So when push came to shove, Mr. Ross in his best year would have been chairman of six movies. The rest of the job is managing marketing and release dates for the four brands -- making sure the Pixar, Marvel and DreamWorks labels are getting along -- while overseeing a music label (Hollywood Records) and Disney's Broadway division, which has for years been run by Thomas Schumacher.
What senior movie executive wants to be chairman of six movies?
Mr. Iger, who has been traveling in China on business since the ouster of Mr. Ross, has told senior lieutenants that it could be weeks before he settles on a new leader. On Wednesday, a Disney spokesman declined to comment.
Names that have been floating around Hollywood, including Mr. Feige of Marvel and Stacey Snider, a co-owner of DreamWorks and its chief executive, are unlikely to get the job even if they want it, according to people with knowledge of the matter who insisted on anonymity to preserve their relationship with Mr. Iger. Other potential candidates, including Alan Bergman, the respected president of Walt Disney Studios, are viewed as lacking the necessary swagger, these people said.
Mr. Iger's decision to push out Mr. Ross before having a successor in place partly reflects the power of Hollywood's gossip mill. The people close to Mr. Iger pointed out that conducting a search behind Mr. Ross's back would quickly get back to him and humiliate and undermine him. They also said Mr. Iger believed that the studio was in good enough shape to operate without a chairman for a stretch, in no small part because of its strong division chiefs.
Mr. Iger's ease may also reflect his own oversight of the studio, which appears to be much closer than many people in Hollywood realize. For instance, he urged Mr. Feige to add more humor to ''The Avengers,'' a superhero event film that opened in international markets on Wednesday and arrives in North America next week. He visits Pixar's headquarters outside of San Francisco several times a month, and discusses scripts with important Disney partners like the producer Joe Roth, who is working on ''Oz,'' and Jerry Bruckheimer, whose Disney projects include ''The Lone Ranger'' and another ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' movie.
Still, Mr. Iger, who has described film as important fuel for the rest of the company's products, like theme park rides and merchandise, will not want to wait too long to answer the questions hanging over Walt Disney Studios. ''What is a Disney movie? What does it mean to be a Disney movie?'' Mr. Bailey said during part of his presentation to theater owners on Tuesday. ''It's not an easy question to answer.''

HEADLINE: White House Announces Intention to Encourage Biological Manufacturing Methods

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

 BODY:
The Obama administration is expected to announce a broad plan on Thursday to foster development of the nation's ''bioeconomy,'' including the use of renewable resources and biological manufacturing methods.
The National Bioeconomy Blueprint, as the plan is called, discusses a variety of measures and strategies to spur research and development of medical treatments, crops, biofuels and biological manufacturing processes that would replace harsher industrial methods.
Use of biology ''can allow Americans to live longer, healthier lives, reduce our dependence on oil, address key environmental challenges, transform manufacturing processes, and increase the productivity and scope of the agricultural sector while growing new jobs and industries,'' the report says. 
Much of what is in the 43-page-report, which the administration released before its planned announcement on Thursday, is a list of government programs that are already under way. So it is not clear what concrete changes, if any, will result.
Still, some biotechnology industry executives and scientists welcomed the plan as a sign of the government's commitment, saying it would now be easier to push for specific new programs to foster biotechnology development.
''This may be the first time the country has recognized the total impact that biological sciences has for the current and future economy,'' Dr. Phillip A. Sharp, a Nobel laureate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who was not involved in the project, said in an e-mail.
The government is expected to announce some fairly new efforts on Thursday that fit with the blueprint. One would strengthen a program that encourages federal agencies to procure bio-based products, like lubricants made from soybeans. Another would allow a repository of clinical trial data at the Food and Drug Administration to be used for disease research.
President Obama is under pressure to create jobs and has long supported innovation as a key to the future of the American economy. But some people in the biotechnology industry have grumbled that the White House's idea of innovation focused on electronic devices, social media and solar energy.
''We've been ringing the bell saying, 'Don't forget us,' '' James Greenwood, the president of the Biotechnology Industry Organization, a trade group, said in an interview. The blueprint is ''a sign that the message has been received,'' he said.
Other countries are also pursuing bioeconomy plans. The European Commission adopted its strategy in February.
But the term bioeconomy is not that well defined. The European strategy focuses on sustainable industrial processes. The White House blueprint is aimed at fostering all biology-based businesses, including pharmaceuticals and medical devices.
President Obama announced last September that the administration would develop the blueprint. The White House Office of Science and Technology Policy then sought public comment on what such a plan should contain, including whether there were particular ''grand challenges'' that should be tackled. It received 135 comments from individuals or organizations.
But the blueprint does not commit the government to embark on any particular grand challenges, like curing cancer.
The report says that advances in genetic engineering, DNA sequencing, computing and other disciplines might make possible things like liquid fuels produced directly from carbon dioxide, biodegradable plastics made from biomass, tailored foods to meet specialized dietary requirements and personalized medical treatments based on a patient's genetic makeup.
The plan lays out five strategies, all of which are already being pursued.
One is to support research and development, including by offering prizes for innovation. Another is to better move discoveries from the laboratory into commerce, in part by having companies get more involved with universities.
Two others are to improve education and work force training, and to encourage collaborations between the public and private sectors.
The fifth strategy, to make regulation faster and more predictable, is likely to be most welcomed by the biotechnology industry. Some pharmaceutical and medical device industry executives have complained that the F.D.A. can be too stringent and nontransparent, discouraging investment in their fields.
The agency is already making some changes to device regulations. And the Department of Agriculture is seeking to speed up reviews of genetically engineered crops.
Yet some consumer advocates say that regulation, particularly of medical devices, has been too lax, allowing unsafe products onto the market.
Some groups are also calling for regulation of a field that could be a cornerstone of the bioeconomy, synthetic biology, which involves synthesizing DNA to create novel organisms to perform specific tasks. The blueprint does note that creation and use of novel organisms ''carry potential safety and security risks if misapplied.''
Jim Thomas of the ETC Group, an environmental organization, said the whole idea of a bioeconomy was misguided. Using crops and other plants for energy or manufacturing could lead to destruction of forests, particularly in the tropics, and increases in food prices
''A biomass economy is the recipe for more land grabs, increased hunger, particularly in the developing world, and putting more control of land and food production in the hand of large agribusiness,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Allies Urge Romney to Shift to Positive Campaign

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
Republicans have a message for Mitt Romney: it's time to go positive.
Prominent party leaders, unsettled by the frequently combative tone of Mr. Romney's presidential campaign, are pressing the presumptive Republican nominee to leaven his harsh criticism of President Obama with an optimistic conservative vision that can inspire the party faithful, appeal to swing voters and set out a governing agenda should he win in November.
Their worry: that the angry tenor of the Republican primary season could carry over into the general election, leaving Mr. Romney trapped in a punch-counterpunch campaign that would limit his ability to define fundamental differences with the Democrats. In interviews, these Republicans said that Mr. Romney must focus more on what he is for, not just what he is against.
''Mitt Romney has to come up with a plan and policy and principles that people can rally around,'' said Gov. Gary R. Herbert of Utah, a strong supporter of Mr. Romney who said it was ''fair game'' to point out differences with the president. ''It can't just be negativity.'' 
Calls for Mr. Romney to adjust his approach, which the campaign has so far resisted, carry special weight because they come from many of his best-known supporters, like Jeb Bush, the former governor of Florida, and Mitch Daniels, the governor of Indiana.
In interviews, Republican leaders said they agree with Mr. Romney's attacks and understand that he is trying to harness the anger of the Republican base. But they said he has not yet struck the right balance between explaining what is wrong with his opponent's record and what is admirable about his own.
The goal, they said, should be to capture the sunny conservatism embodied by Ronald Reagan and to a lesser extent George W. Bush, neutralizing liberal efforts to portray Mr. Romney as biting and backward-looking.
The issue is important for Mr. Romney because he has often had difficulty talking about his conservative principles without sounding forced and off key (describing himself as ''severely conservative'') or creating policy problems for himself (calling for illegal immigrants to self-deport). And it does not help that polls show Mr. Obama starts with an advantage among voters when it comes to likability.
When Rick Snyder, the Republican governor of Michigan, endorsed Mr. Romney recently, he delivered this advice: ''The American people want to hear a positive vision for America.''
''You want to have a situation where people have a reason to vote for you, not a campaign based on why not to vote for somebody else,'' Mr. Snyder said.
William Kristol, the conservative writer, gently chided Mr. Romney this week in the pages of his magazine, The Weekly Standard, for engaging in small-bore squabbles with the president, including a withering speech in Charlotte, N.C., that the Romney campaign billed as a ''prebuttal'' to Mr. Obama's address at the Democratic National Convention.
''Instead of giving rebuttals and prebuttals to Obama's speeches, Romney can give serious speeches about the Constitution and the Supreme Court, the case for limited government and the threat of bankruptcy and penury, about undoing Obamacare and what will replace it,'' Mr. Kristol wrote.
''Romney should run for president rather than run against Obama,'' he wrote. Mr. Romney has touched on some of those issues on the campaign trail, but they are rarely the thrust of his speeches.
The sustained nastiness of a presidential nominating contest traditionally gives way, eventually, to a finer-tuned, more upbeat message in the general election. But Mr. Romney was forced to wage a longer and harder nominating fight than expected, which could make it tricky for him to quickly pivot into a gentler mode.
And in the days since Rick Santorum dropped out of the race, effectively crowning Mr. Romney the nominee, the former Massachusetts governor has only intensified his attacks on Mr. Obama, traveling to North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Ohio to deliver often slashing assessments of what he has called the president's ''record of failure,'' his habit of ''punishing people'' and his plan to ''attack success.''
In an interview, Mr. Daniels said, ''I do think he ought to shift gears now.''
He added, ''Very few Americans need anyone, Governor Romney or anyone else, to tell them much about the president's record. It's there for them to see. I don't think there is any particular tactical reason for Governor Romney to keep belaboring that.''
Several Republican leaders said they are not hearing enough of Mr. Romney's own plans for fixing what's broken.
Jeb Bush said that Mr. Romney ''needs to stay above the fray.'' In an interview a few days ago with Newsmax, a conservative media organization, he called on Mr. Romney to ''offer a hopeful message that can lift people's spirits, because after the end of this four or five months of really negative campaigning, I think people are going to be motivated by a more positive message.''
It is a sentiment echoed by several voters attending Mr. Romney's campaign events. Linda Heck showed up at a factory in Lorain, Ohio, late last week to hear Mr. Romney explain his plans for the economy. She was disappointed that much of his speech ticked off a list of grievances against the president.
''I didn't hear a lot of 'This is what I'm going to do and this is how I'm going to do it,' '' Ms. Heck said.
Mr. Romney's aides privately acknowledged that they must find a way to evoke the kind of optimism that can attract moderate Republicans and independent voters. (Mr. Romney seemed to take a half-step in his speech Tuesday night, after winning five primaries, declaring that ''Americans have always been eternal optimists.'')''Mitt Romney is going to present a positive plan for how he would govern and contrast that with President Obama's failures,'' said Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior campaign adviser to Mr. Romney.
The campaign shows no immediate sign of shifting from attack mode, precisely the approach some supporters want him to maintain. Terry Branstad, the Republican governor of Iowa, said Mr. Obama was the candidate running the negative campaign. ''He is spending his time personally attacking Romney,'' said Mr. Branstad, who encouraged Mr. Romney to keep highlighting the president's shortcomings.
''I believe if we do that, we will win this general election.''
Mr. Herbert, the Utah governor, said that he wanted to hear Mr. Romney discuss a topic he routinely skirts, for fear of reminding voters of his prodigious wealth: his successful career.
Mr. Romney, he said, should frame his financial success as a totem of the America he is fighting to restore -- a free-market economy, unburdened by overregulation and big government, in which entrepreneurs thrive and, in turn, employment grows.
''He has been way too timid about talking about his successes in the private sector,'' Mr. Herbert said. ''It's what's great about America. I can be the next Bill Gates or Mitt Romney.''

HEADLINE: Geithner Replies To Tax Plan Critique

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
The Obama administration on Wednesday fired back at an adviser to Mitt Romney who had asserted that the president's economic plans would mean a huge tax increase for all Americans. 
R. Glenn Hubbard, chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush and now an adviser to Mr. Romney, wrote in The Wall Street Journal that the spending Mr. Obama proposes for the next decade would require an 11 percent tax increase for Americans who make under $200,000 a year. That would be on top of tax increases Mr. Obama has proposed for higher-income Americans.
The president has long pledged not to raise taxes on the middle class and poorer Americans. ''President Obama's budget fails to identify the choices he will ask us to make,'' Mr. Hubbard wrote. ''But the arithmetic is clear: His path means large tax increases for all Americans.''
Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner offered a harsh retort in an interview with John Harwood of CNBC and The New York Times on Wednesday. ''That's a completely made-up, remarkably hackish observation for an economist,'' he said.
Austan Goolsbee, who held the same job as Mr. Hubbard in Mr. Obama's White House before returning to the University of Chicago, offered his own rebuttal on a blog.
''Glenn and I have been friends for pushing 20 years, but on this one, Glenn seems to have jumped the shark,'' Mr. Goolsbee wrote.
Mr. Hubbard responded that his article simply relied on two arguments that are hard for Mr. Obama's advisers to refute.
''The first is arithmetic -- raising taxes on high-income individuals generates much too little revenue to close the budget gap,'' he said by e-mail. ''The second is policy -- righting the ship requires reducing the size of government or raising taxes more broadly. These points may be uncomfortable, but they are not controversial.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Yielding to 'the Real World,' Gingrich Tells Romney He'll Quit the Race

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Newt Gingrich's presidential campaign was always improbable: He was a Washington insider, twice divorced, with a lavish lifestyle and a penchant for off-the-cuff bluntness that is perfect for a pundit, not a politician.
But Mr. Gingrich, a former speaker of the House, tapped into conservative qualms about Mitt Romney and umbrage at the press, and he used new financial rules that repeatedly resurrected his struggling campaign with millions of dollars from a single wealthy donor. 
In the end, though, Mr. Gingrich's roller-coaster campaign of ''big ideas'' was brought down by a combination of gaffes and a furious barrage of negative advertising that left him largely on the sidelines after Florida's primary at the end of January.
On Wednesday came word that Mr. Gingrich would formally end his campaign next week and join the swelling ranks of onetime critics of Mr. Romney who have pledged to help him retake the White House for Republicans.
Mr. Gingrich informed Mr. Romney of his decision on Wednesday morning as the Republican National Committee was officially embracing Mr. Romney's claim to the party's nomination. A Gingrich spokesman described the conversation as ''cordial and respectful.''
''I think you have to at some point be honest with what's happening in the real world, as opposed to what you'd like to have happened,'' Mr. Gingrich said at a Republican Party event in North Carolina on Wednesday morning.
The decision leaves only Representative Ron Paul of Texas in the race with Mr. Romney and helps clear away distractions for Republicans as they gear up for what is likely to be a six-month, $2 billion clash with President Obama.
For weeks, Mr. Gingrich had appeared unwilling to take his own advice, pushing forward to the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla., this summer and pinning his hopes on delegates who he predicted would abandon Mr. Romney in favor of a conservative alternative.
But the lack of money and the lack of primary victories finally caught up with him. His campaign owes more than $4 million to vendors after winning just 2 of 43 contests. Mr. Romney scored commanding victories Tuesday in five primaries, including one in Delaware, where Mr. Gingrich had campaigned enthusiastically.
Aides said Mr. Gingrich and his wife, Callista, had decided to spend the next several months as ''citizens,'' helping to turn out conservative voters on behalf of Republicans.
Even before Mr. Gingrich's announcement, the Republican National Committee had announced plans to put its resources at the disposal of Mr. Romney's Boston-based campaign.
''Governor Romney's strong performance and delegate count at this stage of the primary process have made him our party's presumptive nominee,'' said Reince Priebus, the committee's chairman. ''In order to maximize our efforts, I have directed my staff at the R.N.C. to open lines of communication with the Romney campaign.''
Three veteran Republican strategists with ties to Mr. Romney's brain trust will be the primary conduits between the two operations, officials said. They are Brian Jones, a former party official; Ward Baker, a political consultant from Tennessee; and Kevin Madden, a former spokesman for Mr. Romney.
The Romney campaign has begun to convert the primary-season operation to a general-election behemoth able to take on Mr. Obama's Chicago-based organization. It will also include the quiet search for a vice-presidential nominee.
In Washington on Wednesday, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida continued his unofficial audition with a foreign policy speech intended to highlight his grasp of national security. In the speech, at the Brookings Institution, he called for continued engagement by the United States abroad.
''On the most difficult transnational challenges of our time, who will lead if we do not?'' asked Mr. Rubio, who campaigned with Mr. Romney earlier in the week. ''The answer, at least today, is that no other nation or organization is willing or able to do so.''
Also on Wednesday, Gov. Rick Perry of Texas endorsed Mr. Romney, three months after ending his presidential bid. ''Mitt's vision and record of private sector success will put America back on the path of job creation, economic opportunity and limited government,'' his statement said.
But the day's news cycle belonged primarily to Mr. Gingrich, whose decision to abandon his presidential bid was expected and notable at the same time.
He announced his presidential intentions almost a year ago, pledging solutions to the nation's ills in spite of forces aligned against change. But his gauzy promise of ''hope and opportunity'' amid economic strife fizzled quickly amid reports that he held a $500,000 line of credit at Tiffany's and blowback over his bluntly critical assessment of the budget proposals offered by House Republicans as ''right-wing social engineering.''
That might have been the end of his candidacy if not for two factors: his ability to take command of the debates, often by assailing the press, and his relationship with Sheldon Adelson, a billionaire casino magnate who pumped $20 million into a ''super PAC'' backing Mr. Gingrich.
The debate performances forced Americans to take a second look at Mr. Gingrich, and his numbers shot up in polls. The money gave his campaign the ability to withstand brutal ads, mostly from Mr. Romney and his allies, that would have destroyed a campaign with fewer resources.
But after a victory in South Carolina, Mr. Gingrich stumbled in the Jan. 31 Florida primary and beyond. After weeks of hanging on to the faint hope of a contested convention, he set up his own exit strategy this week by suggesting that he might have to reassess if he did not win the Delaware primary. He did not, and on Wednesday he told Mr. Romney of his plans during a phone call.
R. C. Hammond, a spokesman for Mr. Gingrich, said the candidate had made no deals with Mr. Romney in exchange for dropping out and had never asked Mr. Romney for help paying off his campaign debt.
''We take responsibility for all the debt obligations that we have,'' Mr. Hammond said, adding that Mr. Gingrich planned to spend the coming months trying to raise money to pay them off. He said Mr. Gingrich planned to spend the fall campaigning for Republicans.
''Victory only comes for Republicans with a strong conservative turnout in the fall,'' Mr. Hammond said.

HEADLINE: Two Parties Find a Way to Agree, and Disagree, on Student Loan Rates

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Peter Baker reported from Iowa City, and Jennifer Steinhauer from Washington.

 BODY:
IOWA CITY -- As President Obama wrapped up a barnstorming tour of college campuses in swing states on Wednesday, Democrats and Republicans agreed that they wanted to avoid a steep increase in the student loan interest rate this summer. But the chief issue remained unsettled: how to pay the cost of doing so.
In a second day of campaign-style rallies, Mr. Obama pressed his attack on Republicans, depicting them as unsympathetic to college students in need. Republicans countered by accusing the president and his Democratic allies of playing politics with the issue and trying to raise taxes on small businesses to pay for the subsidized rate. 
Caught in the middle were seven million college students who will see the interest rate on their federally subsidized loans double to 6.8 percent on July 1 unless Congress and the White House come together on a plan to prevent that, at a cost of $6 billion. For a typical student, the White House said the higher rate could mean as much as $1,000 in additional debt per year at a time of high unemployment among recent graduates.
Mr. Obama has made the issue his top talking point in recent days as part of an effort to put Republicans on the defensive and duplicate the political success of the payroll tax cut extension last winter. Speaking at the University of Iowa here, he seized on a comment by an aide to Speaker John A. Boehner that the president should focus on fixing the economy.
''This is the economy,'' Mr. Obama said with indignation in his voice. ''What economy are they talking about? You are the economy.''
Republicans were equally indignant at what they saw as game-playing, saying that they, too, want to forestall the rate increase. They quickly tried to outmaneuver the president.
Late Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Boehner hastily called a news conference to announce that the House would vote Friday on a student loan bill that seemed to take shape just as suddenly. The proposal would extend the current interest rate for federal student loans for one year. The $6 billion cost would be offset by eliminating the remainder of the money from the Prevention and Public Health Fund, a portion of the health care law.
''You know, this week the president's traveling the country on the taxpayers' dime,'' Mr. Boehner said, ''campaigning and trying to invent a fight where there isn't one and never has been one on this issue of student loans. We can and will fix the problem without a bunch of campaign-style theatrics. ''
House Democrats quickly countered that they would offer a bill to maintain the rate by ending tax subsidies for oil and gas companies.
Congress first cut the interest rate on federally subsidized loans in 2007 when Democrats controlled both houses but allowed the cuts to expire after five years because of the cost. The rate moved down gradually each year to 3.4 percent last summer from a high of 6.8 percent. If no action is taken, the rate will jump back up to 6.8 percent this summer.
Mr. Obama included money in his budget to extend the cut, but just for one year. Republicans, in the budget advanced by Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, did not finance an extension. But following the lead of Mitt Romney, the party's presumptive presidential nominee, Republican leaders say they, too, favor extending the lower rate at least temporarily.
''It took me seven years to work my way through college, working every job I could get my hands on,'' Mr. Boehner said. ''And what Washington shouldn't be doing is exploiting the challenges that young Americans face for political gain.''
White House officials said the only reason Republicans were speaking out in support was because the president had embarrassed them, and they pointed to a number of past comments by individual members of the opposition questioning the government role in student loans.
Senator Harry M. Reid of Nevada, the Democratic majority leader, introduced a bill to extend the cuts and pay for that extension by preventing some business owners from sheltering their income from Medicare and Social Security taxes.
He plans to hold a vote to try to overcome a potential filibuster, most likely after next week's recess, giving Mr. Obama a chance to talk about the issue all next week, Democrats said.
Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, responded with legislation introduced Wednesday to keep the low rate and pay for it by taking money from Mr. Obama's health care program.
Each plan was devised in a way to make it unpalatable for the other party to vote for it, thus setting the stage for a potentially protracted fight over how to finance the student loan measure. It was a reflection of the fact that Republicans do not want to have the fight Mr. Obama seemed eager for.
''It sounds to me that they know this is not someplace where they want to go,'' said Representative George Miller, Democrat of California, who sponsored the original 2007 legislation. ''So I think it really is down to how we will pay for it. In this economy at a time when families are struggling and people are concerned about the load of debt, it makes no sense to charge students 6.8 percent.''

HEADLINE: Fed Demurs On Adding To Stimulus

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, on Wednesday dismissed proposals to escalate the Fed's economic stimulus campaign as ''reckless,'' arguing that the costs would be high and the benefits uncertain.
Mr. Bernanke spoke after the Fed's policy-making committee ended a two-day meeting with a statement affirming its intention to continue until late 2014, and possibly longer, policies that aim to increase spending by holding down interest rates, rewarding borrowers and punishing savers. 
The committee again demurred, however, from expanding those efforts, despite its prediction that millions of Americans would not find jobs for years to come.
The Fed also released a set of economic forecasts by 17 senior officials, only some of whom vote on monetary policy, showing that their expectations for domestic economic growth for this year have increased modestly since January. These documents showed that a majority of the 10 officials who vote on policy now foresaw the Fed raising interest rates by the end of 2014.
Taken together, the documents suggested that Mr. Bernanke, who effectively has control over monetary policy, may be facing increased pressure from Fed officials concerned that the central bank has promised too much, even as he confronts mounting external criticism from those who say he is not doing enough.
The central bank has held short-term interest rates near zero since late 2008, and it has sought to further reduce long-term rates through the purchase of Treasury securities and mortgage bonds. Nine of the 10 members of the committee supported the public declaration that the Fed planned to continue these policies at least through late 2014. Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, dissented, saying rates would need to rise sooner.
''The committee expects economic growth to remain moderate over coming quarters and then to pick up gradually,'' the statement said. It said that unemployment would ''decline gradually'' and that inflation remained under control despite the impact of the recent rise in oil prices, which it regarded as temporary.
At a news conference Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Bernanke offered his most complete public explanation to date for the calibration of the Fed's policies.
The Fed is charged by Congress with minimizing unemployment and maintaining stable prices. The Fed predicts that unemployment will remain high for years to come, and it predicts that inflation will remain under control. Under those circumstances, he was asked, why not take stronger action to reduce unemployment?
Mr. Bernanke said that he was concerned about the high level of unemployment but that the Fed's ability to encourage job creation was constrained by its responsibility to keep inflation low and stable.
Lowering the cost of borrowing to spur job creation tends to increase inflation. The current pace is already close to the 2 percent level the Fed considers ideal for long-term economic growth.
Mr. Bernanke said it would be irresponsible for the Fed to pursue a temporary increase in the rate of inflation because it would surrender the credibility of its longstanding commitment to keep inflation around 2 percent. Moreover, he said, the impact on job growth would be ''quite tentative and perhaps doubtful.''
''The question is, 'Does it make sense to actively seek a higher inflation rate in order to achieve a slightly increased pace of reduction in the unemployment rate?' '' he asked. ''The view of the committee is that that would be very reckless.''
The Fed also could expand its purchases of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities, which it views as a way to reduce borrowing costs without the same risk of increased inflation. Mr. Bernanke said this remained under discussion, but he added that he regarded the current level of Fed policy as an appropriate response to existing and projected economic conditions.
The Federal Open Market Committee ''does not appear inclined to take any further aggressive steps, as the labor market recovery has picked up since the fall of 2011,'' Stuart G. Hoffman, chief economist at PNC, wrote in an e-mail on Wednesday.
The statement, released at 12:30, and the economic projections, released at 2 p.m., are not completely consistent, reflecting their different origins. The statement, which declared the Fed's commitment to its current policies, is strongly shaped by Mr. Bernanke, who effectively controls the 10-member policy panel.
The projections, which reflected a somewhat more cautious view of current policy, are compiled from the projections of a broader group of 17 officials, including the 12 presidents of the Fed's regional banks, only five of whom vote each year.
Mr. Bernanke suggested in his news conference that investors and other observers should pay more attention to the statement. He described the projections as the raw material from which the committee's view emerges.
Analysts, however, said the views of the broader group should be viewed as a leading indicator of the direction of policy, suggesting that the Fed had become slightly less likely to maintain current policy through 2014.
The broader group of officials predicted that the economy would grow 2.4 percent to 2.9 percent this year, an increase from their January forecast of growth of 2.2 percent to 2.7 percent. They predicted that the economy would expand 2.7 percent to 3.1 percent in 2013, and 3.1 percent to 3.6 percent in 2014.
There was little change in their views about the long-term path of unemployment, which they predicted would fall no lower than 6.7 percent by the end of 2014.
The Fed also made no policy changes at its last meeting, in March. There are indications that this relative stability will persist for some time.
The Fed's plans are always contingent on economic conditions. In normal times, relatively small changes in the health of the economy produce small changes in monetary policy. But that calculus is different now because, with interest rates near zero, the only options available are big steps. Any new effort at stimulus must be enormous to produce even a small economic boost. And any reduction in existing efforts, however small, would carry the outsize significance of a change in direction. As a result, no change in policy is likely until conditions change significantly.
''If there's a substantial change in the economic outlook in either direction, then there would be a change in the outlook,'' Mr. Bernanke said. ''But for now I think the committee is comfortable.''

HEADLINE: Part 4: Answers to Readers' Questions on Financial Aid

BYLINE: MARK KANTROWITZ


HIGHLIGHT: This week's fourth installment of expert financial aid advice from Mark Kantrowitz, the publisher of FinAid.org and FastWeb.com. 

 BODY:
Mark Kantrowitz, the financial aid expert and publisher of FastWeb.com and FinAid.org, is spending a week with The Choice to answer your questions about scholarships, loans and financial aid offers from colleges.
Mr. Kantrowitz is the author of "Secrets to Winning a Scholarship," published in 2011, and has helped several readers of The Choice navigate the Free Application for Federal Student Aid during his Fafsa Q. and A. series in January.
To submit a question to Mr. Kantrowitz, please use the comment box in our original post or the one below. His answers are scheduled to continue throughout the week.
Questions and answers have been edited, including for space and style. - Tanya Caldwell
Q.
When a college says they are need-blind, is that usually true, or they just blowing hot air?
- SH
A.
Need-blind admissions mean that the college does not discriminate against students who demonstrate financial need. The college admits them without regard to ability to pay.
However, some colleges that are need-blind during the regular admissions cycle become need-sensitive when admitting students off the waiting list, especially if they've already exhausted the financial aid budget. Some colleges may be need-blind for U.S. citizens and permanent residents, but become need-sensitive for international students. 
A need-blind admissions policy doesn't prevent a college from granting admissions preferences to developmental admits, which are students with exceptionally wealthy parents who might donate significant sums of money to the college. Likewise, some colleges with need-blind admissions policies will grant admissions preferences to children of alumni.
Need-blind admissions does not mean that the college meets the full demonstrated financial need of all admitted students. This can lead to an "admit-deny" situation, where the college grants the student admission but fails to provide the student with the financial aid needed to be able to afford the college costs.
A need-blind admissions policy also works against low-income students. Few, if any, colleges maintain an admissions preference for low-income students. The greater selectivity of more elite colleges may indirectly discriminate against low-income students. Low-income students cannot afford to pay for SAT test prep classes. Instead of participating in extracurricular activities, athletics or learning a musical instrument, they may be working one or two part-time jobs to help put food on the table. Frankly, a low-income student who succeeds academically despite adversity is much more impressive than a wealthy student who had every opportunity handed to him or her on a silver platter. But the elite colleges don't seem to recognize this.
Q.
Please explain in detail your often-repeated assertion that everyone should apply for financial aid. I have used every financial aid calculator out there, and they all say the same thing. Our expected family contribution is double the cost of attending the school. My daughter has a list of 22 potential schools. Most offer no merit aid. Those that do, do not require a Fafsa or other need-based form to be submitted in order to apply for merit aid. She is applying to at least two schools that are "need-aware." We definitely have no interest in obtaining a loan. So why would we want to take the time to fill out a financial aid form?
- AJ
A.
If a family is capable of paying for all college costs without incurring any debt, perhaps they do not need to apply for financial aid. But families have a tendency to overestimate eligibility for merit-based aid and underestimate eligibility for need-based aid.
There are also subtle factors that can have a significant impact on eligibility for need-based aid, like the number of children enrolled in college. For example, a family might not qualify for need-based aid when their first child enrolls in college, but will qualify for financial aid when their second child enrolls in college. When there are two children in college at the same time, the parent contribution portion of the expected family contribution, or E.F.C., is cut in half.
The E.F.C. can also be affected by changes in assets. Assets in the child's name increase the E.F.C. by 20 percent of the asset value. The only exception is for 529 college savings plans, which are treated as though they are parent assets. (A portion of parent assets are sheltered from the need analysis process, and the remaining reportable assets are assessed according to a bracketed scale with a top bracket of 5.64 percent.) Families who save for college in the student's name often spend down the child's assets first, yielding a significant improvement in aid eligibility each subsequent year. 
Thus, it is important to apply for financial aid every year, even if the family did not qualify for financial aid last year.
Q.
If our family has absolutely no chance of receiving any need-based financial aid, is it necessary to complete Fafsa forms to be considered for merit-based scholarships?
- Anonymous Guest
A.
Some merit-based scholarships require all applicants to file the Fafsa to ensure that they receive all financial aid to which they are entitled. This is especially the case for college-controlled merit aid. Some merit-based scholarships have a financial need component that determines the amount of the award. There are also about 200 merit-based scholarships that require the applicant to file the CSS Financial Aid PROFILE form.
The Fafsa is also a prerequisite for the unsubsidized Stafford and Parent PLUS loans, which do not depend on financial need.
Q.
 How are trusts treated for financial aid purposes? I am the beneficiary of a very modest trust. My daughters are not beneficiaries until I die. Is the trust counted as part of my assets?
- Polly
A.
A trust fund is considered to be an asset of the beneficiary, even if the beneficiary's access to the trust is restricted. Restrictions established by the benefactor who established the trust are considered to be voluntary.
There are only a few exceptions. If the trust was involuntarily restricted by a court order, it is not reported as an asset on the Fafsa. For example, a trust might be established by a court to pay for future medical expenses for an accident victim. If ownership of the asset is in dispute (e.g., a testamentary trust established by a will that is being contested), the trust is not reported as an asset until the dispute is resolved.
Contingent beneficiaries are ignored until they become actual beneficiaries.
If there are several beneficiaries, each beneficiary reports as an asset only their share of the trust. If the trust does not specify otherwise, each is assumed to have an equal share of the trust.
Some trusts have complicated structures, in which some beneficiaries receive the income from the trust while other beneficiaries receive the principal balance of the trust at a future date. In such a situation, the value of the asset is based on a net present value calculation. This discounts future cash flows from the trust according to an assumed discount rate, like an inflation rate or a risk-free rate of return. The trustee can calculate this figure for the beneficiaries, or one can use a calculator like FinAid's Trust Fund Calculator to calculate the net present value.
Otherwise, the value of a trust is the current principal balance of the trust.
Q.
If you don't apply for need-based financial aid for the freshman year, can you apply for it in subsequent years?
- Sarah Murray
A.
A family may file the Fafsa even if they did not apply for financial aid last year. If the student did not apply for financial aid as a freshman, most colleges will allow the student to apply for institutional grants in subsequent years. The main exception is when a student is admitted off of the waiting list. If a college admits the student off the waiting list because the student does not demonstrate financial need, some colleges will refuse to award institutional grants in subsequent years, unless the family's financial circumstances have changed significantly.
Q.
My daughter has secured admission to an excellent college for her freshman year, with an amazing financial aid package that does not include loans. I had quite a low adjusted gross income for 2011 which, in great part, helped make the offer so good. I am worried about how to calculate any increase in my E.F.C. for her sophomore year (it was barely $1,000 for this year). I've also found conflicting information regarding putting money into an I.R.A. as a way of lowering adjusted gross income for Fafsa renewal purposes. Can you please give me some advice on financial aid for years 2 to 4? Thanks so much!
- Wisconsin
A.
The E.F.C. is calculated the same way for the renewal Fafsa. If the family's financial circumstances are unchanged, the new E.F.C. should be within a few hundred dollars of the previous year's E.F.C. The E.F.C. typically increases by about $3,000 for each $10,000 increase in total income. However, a change in the number of children in college can have a big impact on the E.F.C. There are also some income thresholds built into the formula that can cause a big increase in the E.F.C. when income exceeds these thresholds.
Even if the student's E.F.C. is unchanged, the financial aid package may differ. Financial need is based on the difference between the cost of attendance and the E.F.C. Financial aid is based on financial need. If the college costs increase or the E.F.C. decreases, the applicant may qualify for more financial aid.
Money contributed to an I.R.A. or other qualified retirement plans will not be reported as an asset on the Fafsa. However, the current year's contributions will be counted as untaxed income on the Fafsa. Since the E.F.C. is more heavily dependent on income than assets, contributing more money to a retirement plan will not significantly affect eligibility for need-based financial aid.
Distributions from a I.R.A. will also count as income to the beneficiary, hurting aid eligibility. Even a tax-free return of contributions from a Roth I.R.A. will count as untaxed income on the Fafsa. So retirement plans are not an effective way of saving for a child's college education.
Q.
I will be applying to graduate schools, and there is limited information on financial aid out there. I am seriously concerned about financing this experience but also understand I will not get far in my major without going to graduate school. Do you know of a great Web site that explains options? Right now, it seems as though I have to go to each school's Web site, and it is getting a bit tiring.
- Megan
A.
Many Web sites about financial aid for undergraduate school also include information about financial aid for graduate and professional school. For example, the FastWeb scholarship matching service also includes information about graduate fellowships and FinAid includes information about loans for both undergraduate and graduate students.
Federal aid for graduate school is mostly in the form of loans. Graduate students are eligible for higher loan limits in the federal Stafford and Perkins loan programs and can borrow up to the full cost of attendance, minus other aid received, from the federal Grad PLUS loan program.
Institutional financial aid tends to be less centralized at the graduate level, with each graduate department managing its own fellowships and assistantships. Many graduate students are financed through teaching and research assistantships, in which the student gets a full or partial tuition waiver and possibly a living stipend in exchange for performing teaching or research duties. Some graduate students, especially those in M.B.A. programs, may be able to get their employers to pay for their graduate degree in exchange for a service requirement (e.g., agreeing to work one or two years after graduation for each year of support). Graduate students are usually not eligible for the Hope Scholarship tax credit (also known as the American Opportunity Tax Credit) and must instead rely on the Lifetime Learning tax credit.
The National Association of Graduate-Professional Students (Nagps) provides a national voice for graduate students. Their Web site includes lists of resources for graduate and professional students.
Q.
I'm 17 and will be when (at this point, if) I enter college. I've received acceptances from two Ivies. What if my parents are divorced and neither one wants to provide financial information or pay for college? How should I handle the financial aid process? It seems paying for college is really attached to the parent and not the student (who is, after all, the beneficiary of the education). I don't even think the Fafsa will be processed without information from at least one parent.
- esimo
A.
When a student's parents are divorced, only one parent is responsible for completing the Fafsa. However, some colleges require the noncustodial parent to complete a supplemental financial aid form for the student to qualify for institutional grants. About 250 colleges require students to complete the CSS Financial Aid PROFILE form, which may require the other parent to complete a Noncustodial PROFILE form.
Divorced parents are sometimes reluctant to complete financial aid forms because of privacy concerns. They fear that the college may release their income and asset information to the other parent or the student.
The best solution is to let the college know about the situation. Colleges may not grant a dependency override merely because of parental refusal to complete the financial aid forms or to pay for college. But the college financial aid administrator can talk to the parents and sometimes convince them to complete the financial aid application forms by addressing their concerns.

HEADLINE: A Daunting Emissions Quest for U.S. Cities

BYLINE: DYLAN WALSH


HIGHLIGHT: A case study shows that overall emissions reductions in the Pittsburgh area were achieved through a contraction in the steel industry and population declines -- hardly an ideal strategy. 

 BODY:
More than 1,000 American cities have voluntarily committed themselves to ambitious targets for reducing carbon dioxide emissions. A recent case study focusing on Allegheny County, Pa., home to Pittsburgh, highlights how hard it will be for some to meet those goals, however.
At first glance, one would think that the county is on track. According to a study published this month in the journal Environmental Science and Technology, total carbon dioxide emissions in Allegheny County declined by an average of 1 percent a year from 1970 to 2000. And the Pittsburgh region's current carbon reduction goals are, conveniently, 1 percent per year through 2023.
The difficulty here is that over the same three decades, Allegheny County lost one-quarter of its population and the bulk of its energy-intensive steel industry; that's what accounts for the overall decline in fossil fuel emissions. Per-capita emissions were actually unchanged. 
If continued economic contraction and depopulation were a policy prescription for the Pittsburgh area -- and it's not -- the targets set through 2023 might seem more achievable.

More broadly, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University analyzed trends for energy use and fossil fuel emissions from 1900 to 2000 in Allegheny County. The team then paired these trends with historical changes in the local economy to shed light on the feasibility of the Pittsburgh area's present climate commitments.
Hard study of the numbers gives one "a sobering pause," said H. Scott Matthews, a professor of civil and environmental engineering who co-authored the study with Rachel Hoesly, a doctoral student. "This isn't going to be as easy as it looks."
"We want the results to help people understand the magnitude of change that's required," Dr. Matthew said. 
He said he recognized the rallying effect of sweeping emissions reduction proclamations but that he was concerned that they often are no more than lip service. 
Pittsburgh and some 1,000 other cities have signed the Conference of Mayors' Climate Protection Agreement promoting strong and voluntary commitment to cuts in municipal greenhouse gas emissions. On average, participating cities have agreed to reductions of 1 to 2 percent per year.
Across Europe, almost 4,000 cities have signed a similar agreement.
"The effort required to make significant change is truly astounding," said Matthew Mehalik, a program manager at the nonprofit group Sustainable Pittsburgh, which coordinates local business and government sustainability initiatives. 
Dr. Mehalik, who has collaborated with Dr. Matthews, said he agreed with the paper's basic conclusion. "The grass-roots organic process alone is not going to cut it," he said of emissions reductions.

HEADLINE: A Worrisome Rise in Jobless Claims

BYLINE: DAVID LEONHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: The odds increased that the economy has fallen into a spring slowdown for the third straight year. 

 BODY:
 The odds that the economy has fallen into a spring slowdown - for the third straight year - rose this morning.
 The number of people who filed new claims for jobless benefits held roughly steady last week, according to the seasonally adjusted numbers released by the Labor Department today. The report was bad news because it suggested that the rise in claims over previous weeks might not have been, as some optimists hoped, a statistical fluke caused by the timing of Easter. 
 Last week, 388,000 people filed an initial claim for unemployment insurance (again, according to the seasonally adjusted numbers, which is why the timing of holidays matters). That number was largely unchanged from 389,000 the prior week and 388,000 the week before. Three weeks earlier, though, only 362,000 people filed initial claims, which seemed to be a sign that the labor market was continuing to improve.
 The weekly jobless-claims statistics are notoriously volatile. But three straight weeks of elevated claims suggests that job growth in April may have been as disappointingly modest as March job growth had been, following much better numbers in late 2011 and early this year.

 As Annie Lowrey wrote in The Times last week:
Some of the same spoilers that interrupted the recovery in 2010 and 2011 have emerged again, raising fears that the winter's economic strength might dissipate in the spring. 
In recent weeks, European bond yields have started climbing. In the United States and elsewhere, high oil prices have sapped spending power. American employers remain skittish about hiring new workers, and new claims for unemployment insurance have risen. And stocks have declined .
A third straight year of economic disappointment could have major political implications, hurting President Obama's re-election campaign and helping Mitt Romney, the likely Republican nominee, make the case against Mr. Obama.
 Some optimists, like Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics, still think that the rise in jobless claims and other numbers is more of a blip than a real trend. As last week's article in The Times noted, "The slowdown in part reflects an unusually warm winter, which pulled forward economic activity, making January and February seem artificially good and perhaps making recent weeks look worse than they truly were."
 Mr. Shepherdson said on Twitter Thursday morning that next week's number of jobless claims would be the true test of how large the Easter effect had been and whether the recent trend was real.
 Next week will also bring a new monthly report on jobs, which is far broader than the weekly jobless-claims reports, because the monthly report covers every aspect of the job market, including hiring and firing. (The April jobs report will also be a better measure than Friday's report on gross domestic report, which covers only the first three months of the year.)
 The last monthly jobs report showed that the economy added only 120,000 jobs in March, down from an average of more than 240,000 jobs a month in the previous three months.

HEADLINE: Laura Tyson: The Public University Dilemma

BYLINE: ECONOMIX EDITORS


HIGHLIGHT: Laura D'Andrea Tyson, an economist at the University of California, talks about the financial challenges of public universities and the plight of middle-class applicants. 

 BODY:
Laura D'Andrea Tyson, a contributor to this blog and an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, spoke with Catherine Rampell about the toll that state cutbacks have taken on public universities. Middle-class applicants are most seriously affected, as they may lack the assets or the financial aid to enroll. "It's part of the broader polarization of the United States," she says. Part of the solution might be to raise the sticker price for those who can afford it, in order to subsidize others -- but such plans run up against state restrictions designed to ensure the university's public mission.

HEADLINE: Pick-by-Pick Analysis: The 2012 N.F.L. Draft

BYLINE: MIKE TANIER


HIGHLIGHT: Mike Tanier is at the Radio City Music Hall covering the 2012 N.F.L. draft. He'll provide live updates and analysis of all the first round picks. 

 BODY:
11:09 PM | No. 32: Giants Select David Wilson, RB, Virginia Tech.
Six-Word Scouting Report: Low center of gravity means short!
Strengths: Balance, cutback ability, quickness.
Weaknesses: Fumbling, tap-dancing.
We wrap up the first round with the team no one is talking about: the world champion New York Giants. In a first round full of trades, the Giants stayed put and attracted no undue attention. Of course, no team likes successful anonymity quite like the Giants, and they do not mind at all if you worry about Quentin Coples and the Jets, or the Rangers in the second round of the playoffs, or anything else, while they quietly develop their latest quietly-acquired prospect. Even the Giants fans kept quiet for much of the draft. Spring belongs to Redskins fans, after all. 
Like Doug Martin, Wilson is a short, quick, one-cut runner who can finish his runs. Unlike Martin, he has had some fumbling issues, and he will sometimes tap dance instead of hitting the hole. The fumbles and size make Wilson a little like the second coming of Ahmad Bradshaw. The Giants may hope he develops into something better: perhaps the next Joe Morris.
That concludes tonight's Fifth Down coverage of the N.F.L. draft. If you see a guy walking through Manhattan holding up a Robert Griffin III poster and nodding, remember that you saw him here first!
Giants take RB David Wilson, VT. Crowd goes nuts when Goodell says "World Champion New York Giants."

10:59 PM | No. 31: Buccaneers Select Doug Martin, RB, Boise State
Six Word Scouting Report: Tough subcompact with a winning attitude.
Strengths: Versatility, finishing power, dedication.
Weaknesses: Lateral quickness.
O.K., how on earth did the Buccaneers end up with this pick? It is all a blur. A Patriots-and-Broncos-caused blur.
Martin is a likable young man. He earns high marks for his work ethic and character, and he comes across as friendly and pleasant during interviews. Plus, he is short (5-foot-9), and who doesn't like a tough little running back with a wide smile?
Okay, this is a draft, not a congeniality contest. Martin did not get drafted for his personality, though it helped a bit. He is a classic low-center-of-gravity runner who excels at finishing his runs: he often gains two or three extra yards while getting tackled. He rushed for 2,559 yards and 28 touchdowns in his final two seasons at Boise State, and he also had an impact as a receiver and a critical-situation kick returner. He is similar to former Eagles running back Brian Westbrook, though he is more powerful and less nifty.
Martin is much more versatile than Buccaneers incumbent LeGarrette Blount. Blount recently said that he would not be happy if the Buccaneers drafted a challenger for the featured back role. Martin is not a challenger. He is a flat-out replacement.
10:55 PM | No. 30: 49ers Select A.J. Jenkins, WR, Illinois
Six-Word Scouting Report: Skinny, productive playmaker with good moves.

Strengths: Quickness, productivity, running after the catch.

Weaknesses: Strength, blocking, hands.
With Randy Moss, Mario Manningham, and now Jenkins, the 49ers have made sure that they will never enter a conference title game missing Ted Ginn's services again. Jenkins had 90 catches last year. He was very productive in the slot and when working the middle of the field. He dropped a few passes, and is not the kind of blocker you associate with Jim Harbaugh's run-heavy system, but with Moss and Manningham stretching the field and Vernon Davis threatening the safeties, Jenkins will have a lot of room to work.
Hey, the Giants are on the clock. We are almost done! And the 11 o'clock news is not even on yet!
10:54 PM | Photo: Happy Patriots Fan
10:49 PM | No. 29: Vikings Select Harrison Smith, S, Notre Dame
Six-Word Scouting Report: Best safety not named Mark Barron.

Strengths: Size, range, coverage.
Weaknesses: Run defense, tackling.
The Vikings recorded just eight interceptions last year, so they can use a rangy defender like Smith, who picked off seven passes in 2010. But Smith had zero picks last year, and while he makes a lot of tackles, he misses quite a few. This was a "need" pick, but the Vikings have enough needs that they did not have to reach (there is that word again) for Smith.
There have been so many trades at the end of the first round that it is hard to figure out who is picking and where they got the pick from. When the smoke clears, guaranteed, the Patriots will own the entire third round.
10:42 PM | No. 28: Packers Select Nick Perry, OLB, U.S.C.
Six-Word Scouting Report: Edge rusher passes tape measure tests.
Strengths: Speed, athleticism.
Weaknesses: Instincts, run defense.
Perry ran the 20-yard shuttle at the scouting combine in 4.66 seconds. Out of context, that stat is meaningless. Within context, it is nearly meaningless. It can be nearly impossible to sort through the jumble of "measurables" collected by the league and draft experts and emerge with anything but a headache to two decimals places.
The Football Outsiders do their best to tame all of the hundredths of a second and fractions of an inch with their SackSEER formula, which analyzes several variables and crunches one easy-to-use number. SackSEER took Perry's size, speed, sack totals (21.5 in three years) and workout numbers and gave him a rating of 90.6%. That's an "A."
Here's Nathan Forster, the brains behind SackSEER, explaining what made Perry's workout numbers special. "Perry's vertical leap and broad jump are a full standard deviation above the mean performance for edge rushers, and his 40-yard dash is nearly as good." If standard deviations above the mean are not your bag, just stick with this bullet point from Pro Football Weekly: "physical marvel." Same thing. 
The Packers recorded just 29 sacks despite a blitz-heavy Dom Capers system. Their strategy of surrounding Clay Matthews and Charles Woodson with guys they found on other teams' practice squads had gone too far. Perry gives Matthews a true athletic standout who can draw away a few blockers.
10:38 PM | No. 27: Bengals Select Kevin Zeitler, G, Wisconsin
Six-Word Scouting Report: Great guard. Not a great center.
Strengths: Athleticism, blocking in space.
Weaknesses: Cannot play center.
Poor Zeitler was forced to move to center during Senior Bowl practices after a series of Spinal Tap drummer accidents befell the North squad's center. Zeitler had never played center, even in high school. During one set of practices, a Zeitler shotgun snap sailed over Kellen Moore's head, through the back of the end zone, and bounced off the top of a chain link fence, nearly hitting a nearby writer, who lived to tell of the incident.
So Zeitler is not a center. He is an outstanding guard, however, who can pull block and pass protect. He is the second guard off the board. If Cordy Glenn is selected soon, we will have three guards taken in the first round. Go guards!
10:35 PM | Photo: The Newest Jet
What do you think of the Jets' selection? Let us know in the comments section below.
10:31 PM | No. 26: Texans Select Whitney Mercilus, OLB, Illinois
Six-Word Scouting Report: Sack specialist with a double spike.
Strengths: Athleticism, hand-fighting technique, hustle.

Weaknesses: Experience. 
Mercilus was lifting weights with teammates during spring practices in 2011 when he noticed that a teammate was struggling under a particularly ambitious barbell. Mercilus reached over to try to help the spotter corral the weights, but when everyone's strength gave out, the tip of Mercilus' left index finger was pinned beneath 400 pounds of iron. Mercilus himself was several feet away, cradling his damaged hand.
As a public service to readers, this is a good time to review the do's and don'ts of weightlifting:
Do: Lift with a spotter who is paying attention to your weights, not the aerobics instructor stretching by the mirrors. Select weights that are within your strength range. Push yourself within reasonable limits. Be cognizant of those around you, and never drop weights to the floor if you can help it.
Don't: Put an index finger beneath a 400 pound barbell.
Mercilus needed stitches, a splint for his glove, and peroxide baths for his hand that sound like the horror movie equivalent of old Palmolive commercials. (Madge: "Relax. You are soaking in it." Mercilus: "AAARRRGGGHHHHHH!!!!") The accident kept Mercilus out of the Illinois spring game, but it did not hold him back in 2011, when he led the nation with 16 sacks and nine forced fumbles. 
Mercilus has the quickness to start outside, then knife back inside of his blocker. He has a pass rush move called the "double spike," with one Illinois coach describes as a "wax on, wax off" maneuver. (A warning to anyone who still makes original "Karate Kid" references: no one under 25 has any idea what you are talking about.) The inside-out game and double spike make Mercilus a menace to Big Ten blockers and Cobra Kai troublemakers alike, but Mercilus is very technically raw when you get past his signature moves: he misreads plays, and he can be easily blocked by left tackles who figure him out.
Mercilus is a high-energy player on the field and is well regarded off the field. He will be groomed for Mario Williams' former role with the Texans. He has the athleticism to grow into that role.
10:27 PM | No. 25: Patriots Select Dont'a Hightower, LB, Alabama
Six-Word Scouting Report: 1970s linebacker in a 2010s world.
Strengths: Size, awareness, tackling.
Weaknesses: Man coverage.
Remember how the Patriots traded out of the first round with one of their picks? They traded back. They are as busy as ever. Meanwhile, a quick survey of the team tables has some guys leaning back, a few chit-chatting, and one person literally twiddling his thumbs.
Hightower is a big, tough, smart, hard-hitting, in-the-box defender who can plug holes, smother ball carriers, and drop into zones in a pinch. Unfortunately, he is entering a league in which teams do not run up the gut anymore, where linebackers must drop into coverage 45 times per game and chase running backs with 4.5 speed. In other words, Hightower is a linebacker in a league that prefers pumped-up safeties.
That does not mean Hightower will not be good. Like most Alabama defenders, he arrives ready-to-play, having called the signals in Nick Saban's complicated defense. His ability to blitz will keep him on the field on passing downs. Hightower just has to find the right system, one that does not ask him to chase Shady McCoy around the field all afternoon. Bill Belichick never asks defenders to do what they cannot do, and Hightower will play inside linebacker in the Patriots' scheme, where he can do the grunt work between the hash marks and contribute to the occasional blitz. 
Hightower and Chandler Jones: the Patriots just got much better. That is because they never twiddle their thumbs.
Patriots have moved up twice in the first round. Who is this team and what have they done with bill Belichick?
- Judy Battista (@judybattista)27 Apr 12
10:23 PM | No. 24: Steelers Select David DeCastro, G, Stanford
Six-Word Scouting Report: Retro chic Lombardi-style pulling guard.
Strengths: Blocking on the move, leverage, finishing.

Weaknesses: Size-Power, footwork.
Guards are the bass guitarists of the offensive line. Left tackles are the strutting front men. Centers are the brainy creative element. Right tackles are hard-hitting drummers. Guards are indispensable, yet they are easy to overlook, and somewhat interchangeable. Bill Wyman was one of the greatest bass players in history, but the Rolling Stones replaced him with a session musician 20 years ago, and "Gimmie Shelter" sounds just as good live now as it did in 1991, which is to say, about one-tenth as good as it sounded in 1971.
This draft marks the triumphant return of the guard as difference maker. DeCastro is a superb technician, like Jon Entwistle or James Jamerson. Cordy Glenn of Georgia is more like Lemmy Kilmister, ready to pummel the world into a rumbling submission. Kevin Zeitler of Wisconsin is smooth and precise like early Sting. Washington's Senio Kelemete is fiery and energetic like Geezer Butler. 
It's time to stop before someone gets compared to Tina Weymouth.
DeCastro's strength is his ability to block on the move. He pulls out quickly to lead sweeps, can slip behind fellow linemen to trap block, and has quick feet in pass protection. One of the hardest elements of pull blocking is knowing what to do when you turn the corner and see three defenders closing on your running back, but DeCastro understands blocking schemes and chooses the right opponent to hit. Once he engages, DeCastro stays locked to his defender.
Those were great attributes for a guard to have for most of football history, but pull-blocking techniques have fallen out of favor in the pass-happy modern N.F.L.The Steelers are more of a drive blocking team, but they cannot be choosy when a lineman of DeCasto's caliber slides down the draft board. The Steelers allowed 42 sacks last year, and no lineman was healthy enough to start more than 14 games.
10:20 PM | No. 23: Lions Select Riley Reiff, OT, Iowa
Six-Word Scouting Report: Classic Iowa lineman with surprising elusiveness.
Strengths: Quickness, technique, experience.
Weaknesses: Power, stopping inside moves.
When Reiff was a 19-year old incoming college freshman, he was seen acting disoriented and disrobing in an Iowa City alley. When police officers confronted him, Reiff ran into the kitchen of a nearby restaurant, knocked over some trays, then somehow escaped back into the city, leading a total of eight officers on a 20-minute chase on foot.
We recount this story not to cast aspersions on Reiff's character - teenagers do dumb things sometimes - but to plant the image of a half-naked offensive lineman careening through a busy kitchen, with a policeman requesting backup, shouting into his radio and ducking behind his cruiser door as deviled eggs splatter against the windshield in John Woo-directed slow motion. What kind of offensive lineman can run for 20 minutes? Is it possible to run for 20 minutes and still be in Iowa City? Did Reiff start on the city's western border before finally being apprehended on the eastern border, squad cars and bloodhounds in hot pursuit? The incident sounds more like a Scooby Doo chase sequence, with Reiff running in and out of hallway doors and disguising himself inside an old suit of armor while groovy music plays on the soundtrack.
It does not matter: that all happened long ago. Reiff went on to become a three-year starter for the Hawkeyes and is the most fundamentally sound tackle in this year's draft class. He has fine technique, mirrors and counters the attacks of pass rushers well, and opens holes in the running game by taking good angles on his defender and keeping him away from the ball. Reiff does not have overwhelming power, and he can be beaten to the inside when blocking for deep passes, but he should be an immediate starter. His first job will be to keep Lions quarterbacks alive against the Lions defensive line during practice.
10:17 PM | No. 22: Browns Select Brandon Weeden, QB, Oklahoma State
Six-Word Scouting Report: Great arm, remembers first Bush administration.
Strengths: Arm, release.
Weaknesses: Age.
The Browns' offense is like a malfunctioning home entertainment center. You can tell it is not working, but the best way to figure out what is wrong is to unplug everything, test it independently, and troubleshoot on an item-by-item basis. Did Colt McCoy's ineffectiveness limit the receivers and the running game? Did Peyton Hillis (now with the Chiefs) hold everyone else back with his nagging injuries and sudden willingness to hit the ground at the slightest contact? Did rookie Greg Little drop so many passes that it made McCoy look bad? Should the game system run though the speakers, or the Blu-ray player? 
Unfortunately, football teams do not come with HDMI cables, and all we had to work with last year was the static on the screen: a meager 4.5 yards per offensive play, four lowly rushing touchdowns, a 56.1 percent team completion rate. Trent Richardson will help, but the Browns have just opted for the low-tech solution: throw away the television (McCoy) and get something old fashioned.
Weeden was born on October 14, 1983. He is one month older than Aaron Rodgers. He spent several seasons in the Yankees organization as a pitcher, then red-shirted at Oklahoma State, spent two seasons on the bench, then finally earned a starting job for the Oklahoma State Cowboys at an age when most successful N.F.L. quarterbacks are settling in to starting jobs with teams like the Dallas Cowboys.
Baseball analysts, with their sabermetric precision, know that prospects in their late 20s are not really prospects: the 27-year old outfielder who hits 35 home runs in AAA projects as a major league pinch-hitter, but not a star. Football analysis is not quite so advanced, so some are projecting the grown man who threw 37 touchdowns in the Big 12 as an immediate starter who can play at a high level until his mid-30s, five or six years or now. But only the best quarterbacks play until they are 33 years old. Joey Harrington is 33 years old. Brooks Bollinger is 32. Weeden is just good enough to create a quarterback controversy on a weak team, win a job by default, then put the same team back on the quarterback market as his skills fade.
That is just what he is about to do. The Browns just got older and less experienced at quarterback at the same time. And they consider it progress.
10:12 PM | No. 21: Patriots Select Chandler Jones, DE, Syracuse
Six-Word Scouting Report: Defensive line: the original Ultimate Fighting.
Strengths: Athleticism, hand-and-punch technique.
Weaknesses: Edge quickness.
The Patriots had four picks in the first two rounds this season because of past trades. There appeared to be a method to their seemingly compulsive need to acquire extra picks. The original plan: start with four this year, use them to acquire eight next year. Then 16, 32, and so on, exponentially. By the year 2044, the Patriots would have over eight billion draft picks, and since the population of earth is just over six billion, we would all be under Bill Belichick's direct authority.
Lucky for us, the Bengals made the Patriots an offer they could not accuse, and Belichick values Chandler Jones more than world domination. Or perhaps, Jones is just the latest tool for world domination.
Jones' brother is Ultimate Fighting champion Jon Jones. His other brother plays for the Ravens. Family arguments about which cartoon to watch on Saturday morning must have looked like pay-per-view wrestling events. Chandler admits that Jon is the toughest sibling in a very tough family. "But the best football player, I would say, is me," he said in a radio interview.
Jones brings some ultimate fighting tactics to the defensive line. He has the most refined hand technique among defenders in this draft class. He knows how to deliver an initial punch, how to keep his arms inside his blockers arms, and how to rip away from blocks. This makes Jones hard to latch onto, even though he is not as quick or as muscular as the other elite linemen in this draft class. 
Jones has great athleticism to go with his punch-and-rip tactics. Against Pitt, he sniffed out a screen pass at the last second, leaped into the air, and hauled in an interception on what should have been an easy toss. Big East blockers did not know what to do with Jones, and many opponents rolled away from his side of the field.
10:08 PM | No. 20: Titans Select Kendall Wright, WR, Baylor
Six-Word Scouting Report: Robert Griffin's little nifty, shifty sidekick.

Strengths: Quickness, hands, yards-after-catch.

Weaknesses: Size, route running.
Wright is often described as a Victor Cruz type. Remember eight months ago, when you had no idea who Victor Cruz was? Now he's a "type." At the combine, Wright compared himself to Steve Smith. Remember Smith? You tore your garments with despair when he signed with the Eagles. Now, you are more interested in Victor Cruz types.
Wright's college career was nothing like Cruz's: instead of looking like just another guy at Hofstra, Wright paired with Heisman Trophy winner Robert Griffin III to catch 108 passes as a senior, some of them eye-popping one-handed grabs or short slants that turned into huge gains. The slant-and-go ability probably fuels the Cruz comparison, but Wright looks more like one of the Steelers receivers (Mike Wallace or Antonio Brown) on closer examination. Let him lose against zone coverage in your secondary, and he will run away from everyone. Throw him a screen, and he will turn one move into 30 yards. Jam him at the line or make him run tight routes, and you have a good chance of slowing him down. That's why Wright projects to Cruz's (and Smith's) favorite position: the slot. 
10:03 PM | No. 19: Bears Select Shea McClellin, LB-DE, Boise State
Six-Word Scouting Report: Lineman? Linebacker? McClellin defies easy labels.
Strengths: Speed, versatility, effort.
Weaknesses: No natural position.
It was a routine 7-on-7 drill during Senior Bowl practices. Dan Herron, a hiccup-quick running back whose nickname is "Boom," ran a wheel route, sliding toward the sideline before twisting and darting up the field. The quarterback threw to Herron, but someone was running stride for stride with him, some 6-foot-3 lineman with a blue helmet who adjusted to the ball and swatted it away from its target.
Who the heck was that?
It was McClellin, the 250-pound pass rush specialist turned all-purpose linebacker. McClellin ended the season as a mid-round developmental prospect at defensive end. After playing weakside linebacker at the Senior Bowl, he has become a multipurpose linebacker with the size and tenacity to be an edge rusher but the speed to be an asset in coverage, as opposed to the typical pass rusher who must be hidden when he drops into a zone.
That practice rep introduced many scouts to Shea McClellin, coverage linebacker, but it was hardly his first time covering a running back. "I've done some wheel routes in my career," he said on that January afternoon. Versatility is almost a double-edged sword in the N.F.L. - some teams think so scheme-dependently that they have little use for a multitool player - but McClellin is one of the few outside linebackers in this draft who actually looks like an outside linebacker, not an end who will get on-the-job training at a new position. 
With the Bears selecting McClellin, he is almost certainly going to move to linebacker: he is too small to play end in their scheme. But then again, he should never be counted out.
10:00 PM | Sign Man Is an RG3 Fan
There is a Redskins fan here in a maroon shirt with a maroon cap. He has a Robert Griffin III "Hope" poster, modeled after the old Barack Obama campaign posters. He is standing in the aisle where fans are allowed to wander. He has been holding up the sign for at least 15 minutes.
He holds the sign up to the team tables, and nods with conviction. He holds it to the press corps. He holds it to the crowd. He holds it to the stage. No one is acknowledging him: no "RG3" chants, no back-slaps, or anything.
As the Bears selected Shea McClellin, he held the sign high so the commissioner could ignore it. I picture him walking back to the train station with that sign held high, or holding it up during a bar crawl, or in his sleep.
He is still holding it. He is dedicated.
And he is far less annoying than the dude with the plastic trumpet.
09:56 PM | No. 18: Chargers Select Melvin Ingram, OLB, South Carolina
Six-Word Scouting Report: A pass rusher for all positions.
Strengths: Athleticism, strength, versatility,
Weaknesses: Experience, "tweener" type.
Is Ingram an end? A linebacker? Maybe he's a tackle. Or perhaps a point guard: Ingram spoke at the combine about his days running the floor as a prep basketball star. "I was a scorer," he explained, noting that he was "only" 225 pounds back when he would drive the lane against 16-year-olds. You can picture opposing point guards leaping into the bleachers in self defense.
Ingram is not an end, or linebacker, or even a point guard. He is a football player. He is Mathias Kiwanuka, only faster. Slide him around the formation. Drop him into coverage. Put him at nose tackle on third-and-20. Ingram is a defensive wild card who will be a superstar if his coaches resist the urge to label him and confine him to one role. 
This is a fine pick for the Chargers, who have been slowly leaking talent for about five years. More than anything else, they needed a threat, a player other teams have to scheme for. Maybe that is what Ingram's position should be listed as: threat.
09:48 PM | No 17: Bengals Select Dre Kirkpatrick, CB, Alabama
Six Word Scouting Report: Tall and tough, but mistake prone.
Strengths: Height, hitting, agility.
Weaknesses: Tackling technique, mental lapses.
The Alabama defense was so good last year that it sometimes made scouting difficult. On any given play, C.J. Mosely might collapse the pocket, sending the quarterback straight to Courtney Upshaw, who causes a wobbly pass with a crushing hit, but the Tide fail to get an interception because Kirkpatrick and Mark Barron get such a great jump on the errant pass that they crash into each other. So, how do you scout that? You say "the Alabama defense is good."
Kirkpatrick is the best tall cornerback in a draft full of 5-foot-10 guys. He is a big hitter who sometimes whiffs, and unlike most Alabama defenders, he is susceptible to critical judgment lapses. Kirkpatrick was not letting receivers race right past him in 2011 as he was in 2010, but he remains a high-risk, high-reward defender: Antonio Cromartie, but without great hands.
The Bengals recorded just ten interceptions last year. With two first round picks, they are looking for two impact defenders. Kirkpatrick fills an immediate need and has some upside. Unlike Morris Claiborne and Stephon Gilmore, who were selected earlier, he faces a steeper N.F.L. learning curve.
09:40 PM | No. 16: Jets Select Quinton Coples, DE, North Carolina 
Six-Word Scouting Report: Who can stop Coples? Only Coples.
Strengths: Size, power, run defense.
Weaknesses: Explosiveness, consistency.
So, Quinton, how do you feel about playing with Tim Tebow? Do you think Tebow will inspire you to become a better player? How do you feel about one of the most exciting moments of your life being hijacked and turned into another opportunity to fawn over a backup quarterback with a 49% completion percentage? Why are your eyes glazing over? Is it because you are overcome with joy about getting to play with Tebow?
Just warming up for the next dozen news conferences.
One of the highlights of the Senior Bowl practices in Mobile in January, besides occasionally getting stuck on a pedestrian walkway over an interstate a during tornado warning, was watching Coples battle Georgia's Cordy Glenn in line drills. They crashed together like tectonic plates. They clutched and growled after the whistle. It was like noisy sumo wrestling in pads.
Glenn got the better of Coples in many of those drills, and tape analysis of Coples shows a strong, relatively fast defensive end who rarely has his whole game together. Coples stacks at the line of scrimmage well, and he racks up some sacks against second-tier blockers. But there is a lot of tape of Coples doing a lot of nothing. He appeared to be trying to get by on brute strength in 2011. 
Some defensive line coaches relish the chance to "coach up" raw talent, and Rex Ryan is no exception. Coples should hold the point of attack as a 3-4 end, and he has untapped potential that Ryan may be able to get the most from.
Or perhaps the presence of you-know-who will help Coples elevate his game.
The JEts fans here are restless - not happy wtih the Coples pick at all.

09:34 PM | No. 15: Seahawks Select Bruce Irvin, LB, West Virginia 
Six-Word Scouting Report: Pete Carroll finds a new elephant

Strengths: Quickness, aggressiveness.
Weaknesses: Technique, experience.
Pete Carroll's defense has a special "elephant" role: basically, a linebacker who lines up in various positions and stomps through the backfield in search of quarterbacks. Irvin, with 22.5 sacks in two seasons, is a fine fit as an elephant. The downside: Irwin started just six games in his college career, as the Mountaineers saw him as a situational pass rusher. Carroll excels at finding roles for players like Irvin, but with Melvin Ingram and others on the board, let us say the dirtiest word in all of draft coverage: reach.
The Jets are on the clock. The joint is rocking.
Jets fans want Ingram. They should!

09:28 PM | No. 14: Rams Select Michael Brockers, DT, L.S.U.
Six-Word Scouting Report: Big body. Big potential. Big beard.
Strengths: Quickness, raw power, versatility.
Weaknesses: Experience, production. 
Brockers' beard deserves its own scouting report. Here it is:
Strengths: Full and thick. Well structured. Distinctive. Sometimes makes him resemble a cross between a 19th century congressman and one of the Elbonians from Dilbert.
Weaknesses: Inconsistent. Sometimes inexplicably short. Sometimes sprouts unusual fronds. Appeared lopsided during combine interviews. (That happens when you trim your own beard, because your hand naturally veers during your strong side during the shaping process. This is information you cannot get from any other draft coverage, folks.)
Extensive beard coverage can only mean one thing: writing about defensive tackles has grown tiresome. Brockers is another huge, nimble guy who can be difficult to block: this draft class is crawling with them. He is a converted linebacker who bulked up to 300 pounds, but he still has some of that linebacker quickness. The main downside: Brockers left college as a redshirt sophomore with only one year of starting experience. His game is unrefined, but teams are always willing to provide on-the-job training for young men of his size and talent. The Rams' defensive coordinator, whoever he turns out to be, will be happy with this pick.
And the beard looks terrific. Jeff Fisher knows his facial hair.
09:21 PM | No. 13: Cardinals Select Michael Floyd, WR, Notre Dame 
Six-Word Scouting Report: 37 touchdowns, three alcohol-related incidents.
Strengths: Size, hands, production.
Weaknesses: Play speed, off-field issues.
Type the words "talented wide receiver" into a standard word processor, and AutoText may automatically add the words "with character issues." In Floyd's case, those issues involve three alcohol-related citations in three years, including one for D.U.I. 
Floyd underwent campus counseling and says he is making an honest effort to change his ways. He has also made an honest effort to change his foot speed. Floyd ran the 40-yard dash in 4.4 seconds at the scouting combine. It was impressive, but that figure may have been the result of the kind of performance training that has little impact on what happens when a player is wearing a helmet and getting hit by defenders. Floyd had above average speed at Notre Dame, but his best asset was his large frame, which made him an outstanding possession receiver who could get open simply by putting his body between the defender and the ball.
Floyd was one of the trickiest players to evaluate in this draft class. Three legal incidents were too frequent to shrug off as college life, and the combine numbers do not match the tape. With the Cardinals, he goes to a good situation: Larry Fitzgerald is the go-to receiver, so there will not be pressure to become an immediate superstar. 
09:17 PM | Photo: Andrew Luck, No.1 Pick of the Colts
09:12 PM | No. 12: Eagles Select Fletcher Cox, DT, Miss. State
Six-Word Scouting Report: Quick, hard-working, all-purpose lineman.
Strengths: Quickness, versatility, hustle, tackling.
Weaknesses: Pass-rush technique.
The Eagles already made a major move on Wednesday, if you call getting robbed by Thomas Dimitroff, the Dandy Highwayman, a "major move." Dimitroff, the Falcons general manager who channels Bill Belichick through Beau Brummell, saw the opportunity to liberate the disgruntled cornerback Asante Samuel from the Eagles, leapt in front of the carriage with a hearty "Stand and Deliver!" and left the Eagles with just a seventh-round pick and a scarlet pimpernel. The Eagles are usually on the positive side of such larceny - backup quarterback for second round pick is their favorite tactic - but this time they found themselves on the business end of Dimitroff's rapier.
About two weeks ago, a rumor circulated in Philadelphia that Eagles defensive line coach Jim Washburn really liked Cox. Anyone who was dealt with Washburn knows that he does not keep his feelings to himself: he stops just short of hiring a skywriter if he really likes a prospect. Before long, this bit of non-confidential information bloomed into speculation that the Eagles would trade up to grab Cox and slake Washburn's yearnings.
Of course, Washburn was one of about 32 defensive line coaches with an interest in Cox. Cox played all over the line at Mississippi State; there is no reason to fussily assign him to a certain "technique." (This is a good thing for the Eagles, whose Wide-9 defense often puts linemen in unusual places.) He is quicker than most defensive tackles but big enough to be a load to block at defensive end. He fights through blocks very well and often beats opponents with a second effort. Best of all, he has Michael Strahan's old knack for recognizing a screen, ignoring the quarterback, and sprinting over to hammer the poor running back just as he catches the ball.
The Eagles have a habit of trading up to get their lineman of choice, and Cox came for the price of a fourth- and sixth-round pick. And do not forget: they got a seventh-rounder for Samuel. Stand and deliver! 
09:04 PM | No. 11: Chiefs Select Dontari Poe, DT, Memphis
Six-Word Scouting Report: Choose five synonyms for "he's big."
Strengths: Size, bigness, hugeness, enormity.
Weaknesses: Technique, productivity.
Poe's scouting report reads like the scene from Madagascar II in which a ladies' man hippo tries to woo Gloira, the Jada Pinkett Smith hippo. "You're huge," he says, trying to enumerate her charms. "Large. Vast." This is great pillow talk for animated hippos and nose tackles, but Gloria the Hippo wants a man or giraffe who loves her for who she is, and a first-round pick needs to be more than just girth in a helmet.
What does Poe offer besides size and brute strength? Not much. He recorded just five sacks in three seasons as a regular player, and when you watch tape of him, you see a 350-pound man slamming into a double team of blockers and stopping. Granted, slamming into a double team of blockers and not flying backward is a marketable skill, but the Chiefs did not draft him because they liked the tape. They like the 44 bench press reps, the 350 pounds, and the surprising 4.9-second 40-yard sprint result, which suggest that Poe, like Gloria, has more to offer than just inertia.
The Eagles have just traded up. The Redskins fans let the world know what they think of the Eagles. The Acela ride up from Washington must have been a blast.
09:00 PM | No. 10: Bills Select Stephon Gilmore, CB, S. Carolina
Six-Word Scouting Report: Safest pick at the riskiest position.
Strengths: Size, speed, tackling, experience.

Weaknesses: Footwork, technique.
Sportswriter Michael Schottey said it best on Twitter earlier this week. "Stephon Gilmore has a ton going for him, but his best trait is not being named, 'Janoris Jenkins.'"
There are a lot of talented-but-risky cornerbacks in this year's class, including Jenkins. Gillmore is the talented-but-safe one. He earned a starting job as a freshman, had three productive seasons as a solid cover corner who also blitzes and plays the run well, and got through his college career without generating any police paperwork. He then ran a 4.37 at the combine, showing that he has untapped athletic potential to go with his experience. Gilmore would be a top-10 pick if his technique were better: his feet and hips are all over the place, and receivers sometimes get past him when he tries to gather his body and turn to run.
Even with the footwork issues, Gilmore will become, at worst, a fast, dedicated defender who knows his assignments. That's a heck of a high downside. The upside is also high. The Bills added pass rushers Mario Williams and Mark Anderson in free agency to bolster their pass defense. A great pass rush can make a rookie cornerback's life easy.
08:55 PM | No. 9: Panthers Select Luke Kuechly, LB, Boston College
Six-Word Scouting Report: Provides tackles by the baker's dozen.
Strengths: Productivity, instincts, tackling.
Weaknesses: Quickness, power.
If we could invade Tom Coughlin's daydreams, Inception-style, we would probably find ourselves in a fantasy world populated entirely by hard-nosed, clean cut Boston College linebackers. It would be a world full of Kuechly, with Mark Herzlich driving an ice cream truck that sells only healthy vegetables.
Alas, Kuechly had no chance of staying on the draft board until the Giants' selection, not after recording 191 tackles in 12 games last season and 532 tackles in three seasons as a starter for the Eagles. Watch tape of a Boston College game, and Kuechly is everywhere: making tackles in the middle of the field, chasing rushers out of bounds, or racing back in zone coverage to pick off a pass. He is a step slower than many of the running backs he faces, but Kuechly reads plays well, gets into good position, and uses proper technique when tackling. They may not be high-impact, highlight-reel plays, but when you make about 16 per game, they add up.
Kuechly is often compared to Dan Morgan, so it is only fitting that he was drafted by the Panthers, Morgan's former team. Paired with Jon Beason, Keuchly will be part of one of the most active linebacking corps in the N.F.L.
08:52 PM | No. 8: Dolphins Select Ryan Tannehill, QB, Texas A&M
Six-Word Scouting Report: A potential franchise quarterback. In 2015.
Positives: Athleticism, long-range potential.

Weaknesses: Experience, fundamentals.
This off-season saw the greatest redistribution of quarterback talent in league history. In the course of a few weeks, the fates of franchises changed forever as Hall of Famers, hot prospects, cultural icons, and draft picks stretching halfway into the next political administration changed hands.
The Dolphins emerged from this generation-defining swap meet with David Garrard. It was like spending three days at the original Woodstock and only seeing Melanie. And being sober the whole time.
But the Dolphins have a brand new pair of roller skates! Will Tannehill, along with new coach Joe Philbin, be the key to rescuing the franchise from the doldrums?
In scouting, as in politics or any other venture, we must be careful that the slogan does not become the entire philosophy. It has become fashionable to say that teams must "go all in" when seeking and acquiring a franchise quarterback. The meaning of the phrase "go all in," however, has drifted from "make a concerted effort to evaluate, develop, and surround with talent," to "abandon all common sense and trade every resource to acquire." The term "franchise quarterback" has also undergone dangerous meaning drift; if you do not believe that, read what was being written about Eli Manning nine months ago.
In Tannehill, we have an exceptional athlete who played two years at wide receiver for the Aggies before moving to quarterback midway through the 2010 season and throwing for 3,744 yards and 29 touchdowns in 2011. Tannehill can run. And he can throw: the arm is great, and the accuracy is very good.
But Tannehill's inexperience is also obvious. He holds the ball too long and relies on his athleticism too often. Worse, he locks onto his primary receiver, whether that receiver is open or not. Jeff Fuller, who will be drafted in the second or third round, was Tannehill's top target, and sometimes it looked as if Tannehill was going to throw to Fuller, even if the receiver was in a bunker, surrounded by barbed wire and the 1978 Steelers defense. That lock-on mentality was a major problem in games like the Aggies' loss to Oklahoma State: Tannehill threw three interceptions because he just stared at Fuller until the defense converged, then threw anyway.
So Tannehill is a long range prospect, the kind a team with a 30-something quarterback should draft and groom for two years. Ah, but that was before the "all in" philosophy took hold. Now, the logic is to draft players like Tannehill early, throw them into the lineup, and cross your fingers that they become Cam Newton. Tannehill is working with Chris Weinke, the mechanics guru who accelerated Newton's career, but Weinke does not have a magic wand, And Tannehill has issues that can only be resolved by throwing against live opposition in training camps and preseason games.
Tannehill could develop into Aaron Rodgers. Or, he could be thrown to the wolves early and watch as his bad habits become engrained.
If that analysis ran a little long, we can cut to what the Jets fans here at the draft are chanting: "overrated." Harsh. Essentially true.
They've chanting "overrated" here for Tannehill. Then again, the guy is so impressive he wants to be an orthopedic surgeon. So who cares.

08:45 PM | No. 7: Buccaneers Select Mark Barron, Safety, Alabama 
Six-Word Scouting Report: Another Nick Saban central casting standout.
Strengths: Hitting, range, cherry picking.
Weaknesses: Man coverage.
Barron is a big hitter who loves to hammer ball carriers. Are we still aloud to say that? Are we still allowed to like that? 
Yes, it is still socially acceptable to enjoy hard (legal, not-intentionally-injurious) hits, as long as we don't take the actions or the rhetoric too far. Right, Barron? "The way I've been taught to play the game, I hit hard," Barron said at the combine. "I guess I'll have to make some adjustments I'm not sure if I will, because that's the way I was taught to play the game." Um, you may just want to go ahead and make those adjustments, pal.
Don't get the wrong impression: Barron is tough, but he is not a horse collar tackler, a clothes-liner, or whatever James Harrison fancies himself as. He's a good, fundamentally-sound tackler. He is also excellent in deep coverage, where he can read the play, anticipate the throw, and make a leaping interception. His only weakness is man coverage: he cannot turn and cut with slot receivers or top tight ends. Even with that flaw in his game, Barron has Pro Bowl potential.
The Buccaneers plan to move cornerback Ronde Barber to free safety. Barron will play strong safety. As mentors go, it is hard to imagine a better one than Ronde.
08:40 PM | No. 6: Cowboys Select Morris Claiborne, CB, L.S.U.
Six-Word Scouting Report: Covers No. 1 receivers, not No. 2 pencils.
Strengths: Size, speed, technique, experience.
Weaknesses: Tackling.
The Truth in Sports Blogging Act requires any writers who mention a prospect's leaked Wonderlic score to also disclose their entire standardized testing history to readers. Lest the unpleasantness of falling asleep during the GRE in 1992 come to the fore, we will simply state that the Wonderlic, which is an odd hybrid of a Sudoku puzzle and the Jeopardy contestant test, has little to do with an individual's ability to cover wide receivers, or do much else besides take Wonderlics.
Claiborne has just about everything a team could want in a cornerback. He is tall enough to cover big receivers and quick enough to handle most speedsters. He has great hands for intercepting passes, and two years starting experience in the toughest conference in the nation. He is not a great tackler, and jitterbug types can get away from him, but Claiborne will be an immediate starter.
We would say more, but a deafening anti-Cowboys chant is reverberating through Radio City Music Hall. Here's a hint: Eagles fans learn to say it right after "mama" but before "thank you." But do not blame Eagles fans (yet): this is a Redskins crowd!
08:33 PM | No. 5: Jaguars Select Justin Blackmon, WR, Oklahoma State
Six-Word Scouting Report: 232 catches? What else you got?
Strengths: Hands, agility, productivity, competitiveness.
Weaknesses: Size, playing speed, spread offense receiver.
Blackmon is a great, multidimensional athlete, but he cannot golf. Matt Crossman described his misadventures on the links in this Sporting News profile.
"On his first shot, Blackmon looks like an octopus trying to catch butterflies, all arms and legs flailing all over. Rube Goldberg thinks Blackmon's swing has a lot going on. He pops up like a jack in the box when he makes contact. By the time his swing is done, both of his feet have left the ground and he is facing forward. It sounds like he crushed the ball, but he hit it straight into the morning sun, and nobody sees where it went. 
'It might have disintegrated,' he says."
So ends Blackmon's golf career; it may also mark the last time anyone hits the links with Crossman, lest they get a Rube Goldberg octopus scouting report. No matter: Blackmon caught 232 passes for 3,304 yards and 38 touchdowns in his two seasons as a starter for Oklahoma State. He is strong, he can jump to the rafters, and snatches the ball out of the air with authority. With those skills, teammates will gladly run for cover during charity golf tournaments.
Blackmon burst onto the draft scene with a 111 catch effort in 2010, and a full year in the spotlight made him the Andrew Luck of receivers. Blackmon is not huge and lacks sprinter's speed, caught a lot of short hitch passes in a pinball offense, fumbled in one or two key situations, and has a DUI on his record from 2010. In draft speak, Blackmon now "lacks special qualities" and "has character issues," two flaws the Jaguars overlooked because they are trivial, and because Blackmon had 50 percent more touchdown catches (18) than the entire Jaguars receiver corps combined.
08:31 PM | More Trades! Cowboys Move Up
The Cowboys have traded up! Repeat: the Cowboys have traded up! Grandstanding is just minutes away. And the top of the draft board is all higgedly-piggedly.The Cowboys replace the Rams, who will pick after the Jaguars, replacing the Buccaneers.
And you thought there would be no action this year.
- 
08:27 PM | No. 4: Vikings Select Matt Kalil, Tackle, U.S.C.
Six-Word Scouting Report: Pass protection is his family business.
Strengths: Quickness, Power, Athleticism.
Weaknesses: Balance, Technique.
When the young Kalil went to the park to play football with his father (a former U.S.F.L. lineman) and brother (now the center for the Panthers), the family did not play catch or draw plays in the dirt. They worked on their blocking techniques. "'Let's play football' meant 'let's work on kick-steps' or 'let's do line drills,'" Kalil said at the scouting combine. If dad brought a football at all, it was so big brother Ryan could work on his snaps. Later, when Ryan enrolled at U.S.C. and Matt was still in high school, the younger Kalil became his brother's blocking dummy/chew toy. A youth coach once gave Matt a tryout at tight end, but his father quickly nixed the plan and ordered his son back to left tackle, lest all those idyllic kick-step drills at the playground go to waste.
Stories of Kalil's indoctrination into left tackle orthodoxy stop just short of pushing a blocking sled uphill through the snow five miles to and from school, but you cannot argue with results. Kalil is smooth and powerful as a pass protector. He blocks very well on the move and is also a skilled cut blocker. He reads blitzes well and finds the right man to block. 
Despite a lifetime of line drills, he sometimes gets his torso twisted when trying to stop faster pass rushers, and he loses leverage once in a while. But Kalil can use athleticism to make up for his mistakes. That athleticism sometimes manifests in unusual ways: Kalil blocked four field goals in his career, perhaps motivated by the chance to actually touch a football, something he never got to do very much in childhood.
Kalil also has the nasty on-field disposition that separates good blockers from great ones. He said at the combine that he is not really sure where his "mean streak" comes from. Read between the lines of his boyhood tales, and it is easy to guess. 
08:24 PM | Trades! Socks! Jaguars Move Up
The Buccaneers have traded down. The Jaguars are on the clock. Of course, the announcements are two picks behind the selections as the commissioner receives them. No two drafts are alike, folks.
By the way, Robert Griffin III is wearing maroon and gold socks that say "Catch Your Dreams." No word when they go on sale inside the Beltway.
08:20 PM | No. 3: Browns Select Trent Richardson, RB, Alabama
Six-Word Scouting Report: Too old school for social networking.
Strengths: Interior running, instincts and vision, productivity.
Weaknesses: Long speed, receiving skills.
Richardson sure looks thrilled up on that Radio City stage right now. And his Twitter accounts are blowing up. "So thrilled to be a member of the Browns" he Tweeted on @NotReallyTrentRichardson. "Cannot wait to play with Browns" he added on another account, @ObviouslyAnImposter. He somehow manages to use social networking while both hands are occupied, but you know how young people and smart phones are these days.
Oops. Our fact-checkers have discovered that the Twitter accounts above are not real, so please disregard. This happens all the time to Richardson. An imposter sent several Tweets in early April hinting that Richardson was preparing to play for the Browns, and the Internet being what it is (a slag heap of dubious information and cute panda videos), that misinformation was uncritically passed around. 
Richardson does not have a Twitter account, which could have real implications down the road. Who will Tweet "Rise N Grind" every morning, if not Richardson? Who will re-Tweet shout-outs to number one fan SteffiePooRollTide on her 20th birthday, if not Richardson? How will we know what Richardson thinks of "The Hunger Games"? Someone get this young man wired, pronto!
Here is a story that is not made up: two weeks ago, Richardson escorted cancer survivor Courtney Alvis to her senior prom. This touching ESPN video tells the story. Look carefully, and you will notice that the prom theme is "Starry Night," because nothing suggests a romantic evening of adolescent bliss like a man painting the view from his sanitarium window. But that is neither here nor there: it was a wonderful gesture by Richardson. Also, "Stairway to Heaven" did not make too much sense, back in the day.
There is not much to say about Richardson on the field. He gained 1,679 rushing yards and scored 24 touchdowns for the national championship winners last season. He was so good as an underclassman that he forced Heisman Trophy winner Mark Ingram to share his carries. He is a powerful runner who knows how to find holes in the middle of the line and churn out yardage. He doesn't have outstanding open field speed, but he can crank out 25-carry, 100-yard rushing performances like clockwork. The Browns' featured running back last season, Peyton Hillis, broke just four tackles, according to Football Outsiders. (The league leader, Shady McCoy of the Eagles, broke 50.) Richarson will pass Hillis's total before the Browns play their second game. 
In short, Richardson is an old-fashioned workhouse of a back, which may explain why he cannot be bothered with things like Twitter. He is no doubt thrilled that the Browns traded up for him, even if he neglects to tweet it.
08:13 PM | No. 2: Redskins Select Robert Griffin III, QB, Baylor
Six-Word Scouting Report: Infatuated Dan Snyder's four pick gamble.
Strengths: Arm, mobility, touch, intelligence.
Weaknesses: N.F.L. readiness.
Trading three first-round picks and one second-round pick to acquire one player is like taking out a 40-year variable-rate mortgage on a dream house. The house may be gorgeous, but that is one heck of an investment, and there will almost certainly be some buyer's remorse down the road.
To extend the real estate metaphor, imagine Dan Snyder and Mike Shanahan on the television program, with Snyder as the gung-ho, ready-to-move head of the household and Shanahan as the unreasonably demanding spouse ("The ocean view and 8,000 square foot closets are nice, but I had my heart set on granite countertops and a breakfast sconce in our Javanese bungalow.") It is no wonder that both Snyder and Shanahan fell in love with House Number Two, a.k.a. Griffin: he has a great arm, quick release, runs like the wind, makes good decisions, and has an infectious personality. The price tag was just a little high, and the Redskins will be taking Thursday nights in April off for the next two years so they could move up four spots. But then, those House Hunters couples always find a way to afford their homes of choice ("We are $3000 per month over budget, but we are going to love having breakfast every morning overlooking Krakatoa from our patio, as soon as we can afford breakfast.")
There are no obvious flaws in Griffin's game, but he is a Big 12, spread-offense quarterback, and Big 12 games often look like the easy smart phone versions of football video games. Griffin must adapt from that bombs-away style to Shanahan's conservative take on the West Coast Offense, though there is some evidence that Shanahan will also adapt to Griffin. Kyle Shanahan, the Redskins offensive coordinator, visited Griffin several times in the past few weeks, though it is not clear who learned what from whom during the skull sessions. Assuming that everyone meets in the middle, Griffin will be the Redskins' opening day starter, and since the Redskins have much more talent than the Colts, he is a more likely Rookie of the Year candidate than Luck.

08:06 PM | Under way at the N.F.L.Draft
And with the thundering chords of an old Van Halen song that knocked the press pool 30 feet backward, we are under way. And deaf.
Goodell's greeting this time was a little more cheer-like, though the fans tried to drown him out.

08:06 PM | No. 1: Colts Select Andrew Luck, QB, Stanford
Six-Word Scouting Report: Superlative prospect with one flaw: familiarity.
Strengths: Accuracy, intelligence, experience.
Weaknesses: No "elite" properties.
Pity the prospect that peaks too soon. He enters his final college season as the consensus No. 1 player in the nation, so he suffers from unrealistic expectations, contrarian backlash, and the fickle undertow of public opinion. By bowl season, he has been pulled out to sea, and our attention is focused on The Next Big Thing.
Such is the plight of Luck. After completing 70.8 percent of his passes with a 32-8 touchdown-interception ratio in a complex offense as a junior, he was at the top of everyone's 2012 draft board before most of us even had 2012 draft boards. By early September, Colts fans were wearing homemade Luck jerseys.
Inevitably, we started watching Luck closely, as opposed to what we do for other top prospects: judge them by their highlight montages on SportsCenter. Instead of a glittering replica of the John Elway of our collective memory, we saw a flesh-and-blood mortal who throws incomplete passes (nearly 30 percent of the time!), gets rattled by pass rushers (see the U.S.C. game) and is guilty of various other sins of imperfection. It didn't help that Robert Griffin III emerged as the John Lennon to Luck's Paul McCartney: an edgier alternative with equal-but-different talents, even if the harmonies are not quite as precise.
The most common criticism of Luck is that he lacks special qualities, "special" being the latest vague intangible marshaled to the cause of erasing all critical thought from sports journalism (soon we will only communicate in gibbering nonsense syllables, a changeover which has already begun on ESPN2). Luck is capable of calling three plays in the huddle, surveying the defense at the line of scrimmage, and choosing the best option, which is pretty darned special, but he does suffer from sub-Elway level physical gifts. Add A-minus arm strength and accuracy to B-plus mobility and mechanics, package them with A-plus decision making and work habits, and you get a prospect worthy of the distinguished honor roll. But maybe that is just grade inflation at work.
So pity Luck, but not too much. He will soon be fabulously wealthy. The painfully invasive prospect evaluation process, which lasted about two years for him, is finally over. Luck now replaces Peyton Manning, who faced similar scrutiny and backlash when he left college in 1998. The past is prologue for Luck and Manning: Oliver Luck, Andrew's father, replaced Archie Manning at quarterback for the 1983 Houston Oilers.
The senior Luck ended his N.F.L. career with a 3-6 record as a starter. But then again, he lacked special qualities.

07:44 PM | Commissioner Gets Booed, Sort Of
Last year, Commissioner Roger Goodell was booed lustily at the start of the draft. The lockout was still on, and fans vented with a "we want football" chant and a Rage Boo.
This year, Goodell was met with Catcall Boos when he took his place on the risers among the 26 prospects in attendance tonight.
A Catcall Boo is different from a Rage Boo. As a Philadelphian, I have 275 words for "boo" and only one word for "championship." The Rage Boo is pure, throaty anger, the kind Mike Schmidt did not even hear until he struck out with the bases loaded. Even Donovan McNabb did not hear rage boos. J.D. Drew got a few of them. 
The Catcall Boo is similar to what a Scott Rolen might here at Citizens Bank Park, or a Flyers opponent might here after getting a major. It expresses defiance and disrespect, not out-and-out hatred. The vice principal gets a catcall boo when he cancels the pep rally.
So Goodell is moving up in the world. And New Yorkers are perfecting their boo subtlety.
Booing the commissioner when he's introduced. I understood during the lockout, not quite clear why this year - unless it's all Saints fans.

07:23 PM | Browns-Vikings Trade
The Browns traded the fourth overall pick in the draft, and the fourth, fifth, and seventh round picks to the Vikings in exchange for the third overall pick.
The Browns are expected to select running back Trent Richardson with the pick. The Vikings also had interest in Richardson, but with running back Adrian Peterson recovering from a knee injury and needs elsewhere, the Vikings were in great position to trade down, especially when offered a three-pick-for-one-spot deal.
It now appears almost certain that Andrew Luck, Robert Griffin III, and Richardson will be the first three players taken in the draft. The spectacle begins at 8:00 p.m. ET here, but the drama will not start until about 8:30

07:08 PM | M&M Analysis
The only thing more colorful than Robert Griffin's suit here at Radio City Music Hall are the jars of team-specific M&Ms at each team's table. 
Each team has its own color scheme, and the colors bear an incredible likeness to the team's uniforms. The Jets' green M&Ms are much lighter than the Eagles' midnight green M&Ms. Both sets of executives are advised to lay off the green M&Ms. They have to concentrate, and this is a family draft.
The Chargers have A.F.L. M&Ms, having opted for their light blue classic uniform colors. Let us hope that does not mean the M&Ms have been sitting around since 1964, when one of them melted in John Hadl's mouth but not his hands. The Raiders have black and ... well it is not quite silver. It is more like gray: an M&M wrapped in duct tape.
No word on whether the Seahawks opted for Skittles instead. Actually, their candies are very visible and look great. The Bears, by contrast have candies that appear to be left over from Halloween.
The Redskins still have their candies; they were not thrown into the Griffin trade.
06:41 PM | RGIII's Sock Mystery
Robert Griffin III will not unveil his socks until he is drafted. No amount of cajoling could make him execute a Marilyn Monroe-style leg display.
Here is what the red carpet did reveal: Griffin is wearing a baby blue suit with a magenta knit tie.
Andrew Luck is dressed more conservatively that Griffin, which was expected. With his crisp white shirt, Luck is ready to interview at an insurance company if he has a sudden falling out with Jim Irsay.
Mark Barron's braids are well-braided; his choice of a plaid shirt was bold. Michael Brockers' beard is in full bloom; more on that later.
Neither Hightower nor Upshaw's suits fit. Unbutton the top button!
- Michael Tanier (@FO_MTanier)26 Apr 12
A light drizzle let up early in the red carpet ceremony, and good thing: sitting around in a soaking wet suit for two hours would make Cordy Glenn angry. And you would not like him when he is angry, unless you are his offensive line coach.

This year's draft kicks off with an Academy Award style red carpet promenade along 6th Avenue outside Radio City Music Hall. It is raining. There is no cover. And the press is crowded into a tiny patch of sidewalk on the corner of 51st Street.
The Fifth Down has one question that must be answered: what kind of socks is Robert Griffin III wearing? As soon as we know, you will know.
Let's hope they are absorbent.

HEADLINE: U.S. Assets at Work, Unsupervised

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: The United States has made strong financial commitments to the International Monetary Fund and needs to monitor them more closely, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Most Americans paid no attention last weekend when the International Monetary Fund announced it was well on its way to roughly doubling the money that it can lend to troubled countries - what the organization calls a $430 billion increase in the "global firewall."
The United States declined to take part in this round of fund-raising, so the monetary fund has instead sought commitments from Europe, Japan, India and other larger emerging markets.
At first glance, this might seem like a free pass for the United States. The additional monetary fund lending capacity is available to euro zone countries that now face pressure, like Spain or Italy, so it might seem that global financial stability is increased without any cost to the American taxpayer. 
But such an interpretation mistakes what is really happening - and actually represents a much broader problem with our budgetary thinking.

The International Monetary Fund represents a contingent liability to taxpayers in the United States - much as the Federal National Mortgage Association (known as Fannie Mae) and Freddie Mac (formally the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation) have in the past - and as too-big-to-fail megabanks do now. 
The budgetary consequences of all those government-supported enterprises are known as "contingent liabilities - simply meaning that when something goes wrong, the taxpayer is on the hook. 
The International Monetary Fund is not a corporation, nor does it exactly resemble any other legal entity you are likely to encounter. To understand the way in which the American taxpayer is on the hook, focus on the fact that, like any corporation, the fund finances its activities with a combination of equity and debt.
Traditionally, the monetary fund was financed mostly with "equity" - contributions paid in by member governments. In the 1940s, when the organization was created, the United States paid in dollars and gold (this was when gold was the mainstay of the international payments system). Other countries have also paid in gold, as well as in acceptable "strong" currencies.
According to the International Monetary Fund Web site, "The I.M.F.'s gold holdings amount to about 90.5 million troy ounces (2,814.1 metric tons), making the I.M.F. the third largest official holder of gold in the world."
(On Tuesday, gold was trading around $1,640 a troy ounce, so the market value of the I.M.F.'s holdings was close to $148 billion. For more detail, including on how countries might get back "their" gold, see this fact sheet.)
More recently - and particularly since 2009 - the monetary fund has increased its lending capacity not so much through additional equity (known as "quota" in fund jargon), but through debt. In effect, the I.M.F. is borrowing from some countries in order to lend to other countries.
There is a simple reason for this switch. The monetary fund quota comes with voting rights - and these are currently skewed toward those countries that held the balance of power in the 1940s and 1950s (the fund was created in 1944). The United States has a veto, and the Europeans are overrepresented. 
Now the emerging-market nations, like China and the oil producers, have the cash reserves. These countries would be happy to put up more equity to get a bigger say at the monetary fund, but there is no way that Europe or the United States and its allies would be comfortable with a big shift in who is calling the shots within the international monetary system.
But there's the catch, and to see it, think about the European Union's recent decision to lend 200 billion euros (about $260 billion) to the fund. If the European Union lends to European countries under duress, it could lose this money, in the event of a complete default. But if the union lends to the fund and the fund lends to stressed European countries, then the union has some downside protection - from fund shareholders.
In the event of default or complete nonpayment on official borrowing, including loans from the monetary fund, the losses would be borne in the first instance by shareholders. In this sense the fund is like a bank, with loss-absorbing shareholder capital. If that capital were exhausted by losses, then the fund would be unable to pay back what it in turn had borrowed.
Some officials assert that none of this could happen, because the International Monetary Fund is always paid back - one way or another. Certainly that has been the pattern in the past, but then again we have not seen this level of stress on the international system at least since the 1930s, when all the rules were torn up repeatedly. 
A major euro zone meltdown would cause severe damage around the world. Anyone who thinks otherwise has not been paying attention.
Over the weekend, the monetary fund became a lot more leveraged - that is, its debt increased relative to its equity. The potential future liability to American taxpayers went up, because the risk of large credit losses increased, and those losses would need to be covered by shareholders (and the American stake in the fund is 17.69 percent of quota, with 16.8 percent of the votes). 
There is also an implicit guarantee - arguably without limit - from the United States to the monetary fund. The United States set up the world trading system after World War II, and has a huge amount to lose if it fails. It also has deep pockets, compared with almost all other countries.
Therefore, unlike those at a typical corporation, the shareholders in the International Monetary Fund do not have limited liability, so we should care a great deal about the downside risks. The Europeans are currently increasing those risks - by lending to the fund and planning to use fund loans as part of future bailouts.
The Congressional Budget Office is getting better at scoring contingent liabilities, including United States obligations to the International Monetary Fund, but there is still a lot more work to do. 
It's time for Capitol Hill to pay more attention to the implications for the United States budget (and therefore the likely path for the national debt) of what is happening at the monetary fund - points also made by Desmond Lachman, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, in Congressional testimony (see his Points 12-16). 
Do not take the statements of global leaders at face value. Congressional leaders on both sides of the aisle should begin by asking the Congressional Budget Office to update its scoring of American commitments - explicit and implicit - to the fund.

HEADLINE: Newt Gingrich's Debt

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: Mr. Gingrich currently has $4.3 million in debt- about 20 percent of his Gross Campaign Product, which puts him in Greece territory. 

 BODY:
Newt Gingrich is preparing to make the transition from forgotten-but-not-gone to gone-and-hopefully-forgotten by dropping his presidential campaign next week. And he's doing it in good Reagan-and-Bush-era Republican fashion - carrying on about fiscal responsibility while piling up a nice fat budget deficit.
Mr. Gingrich currently has $4.3 million in debt, according to TPM Muckraker - about 20 percent of his Gross Campaign Product, which puts him in Greece territory. He has more debt than any other failed Republican presidential candidate since 1992.

TPM said he has $1.5 million in cash on hand, but don't expect him to use that to pay down his debt. He'll surely do what politicians have always done: Go back to the well. He'll hit up the same supporters who just finished throwing away vast sums on his candidacy.
The other not-Romneys managed to lose a lot more economically. Rick Santorum owes $1.9 million, and he was actually a contender for the nomination for a while there. Mr. Gingrich never had a chance.
Rep. Virginia Foxx must be appalled by Mr. Gingrich's debt load. Ms. Foxx, you may recall, is the North Carolina Republican who has nothing but contempt for lazy, shiftless people who take out loans to get through college. "I have very little tolerance for people who tell me that they graduate with $200,000 of debt or even $80,000 of debt, because there's no reason for that," she said, speaking on the G. Gordon Liddy radio program.
She added: "I remind folks all the time that the Declaration of Independence says 'life, liberty, and the of happiness. You don't sit on your butt and have it dumped in your lap."
A lot certainly was dumped into Mr. Gingrich's lap - by friends and supporters who contributed to his super PAC. Well, more like Most of the super PAC money came from Sheldon Adelson, the casino magnate, and his family. In Mr. Gingrich's defense, it's not like all he did was sit and wait. He also raised $22.5 million on his own and spent it largely on attack ads.
So to whom does Mr. Gingrich's campaign owe all that money? He owes the single biggest chunk, about $1 million, to a private jet company. It's called Moby Dick Airways. I'm not even going to touch that one.

HEADLINE: Will The Stars Align for Small Nuclear Reactors?

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: Westinghouse has lined up a commercial partner for its small modular reactor, which gives it an advantage in seeking licensing approval and federal aid. 

 BODY:
 A company that wants to build a new kind of nuclear reactor, one small enough that it could be delivered by truck, has found a potential customer. 
The Westinghouse Electric Company has lined up Ameren, a St. Louis-based electric company, as a partner for its small modular reactor project. Getting a strong indication of commercial interest is critical because the Nuclear Regulatory Commission can review only a few of the many proposed reactor designs and gives priority in the licensing process to those with a stronger chance of getting built.
Some utility analysts have argued that small reactors would be good "drop-in replacements" for 1950s and 1960s-era coal plants that are now being retired, given that that their generating capacity would be about the same. But Ameren is looking at its Callaway nuclear plant near Fulton, Mo., where it runs one reactor and had hoped to build 
That would be a multibillion-dollar project, however, and the Missouri state legislature refused to allow Ameren to bill customers for construction costs. So now it is now interested in a plant that is supposed to cost far less, although the companies did not give a price estimate in their announcements.

A commercial partner could also give Westinghouse a leg up in seeking aid from the Energy Department, which said in January that it was seeking applications for grants to help develop small modular reactors. President Obama said then that the department would disburse up to $450 million. 
Holtec International, a company known in the nuclear industry for manufacturing dry casks that are used to store spent nuclear fuel, said it was seeking money to develop a 160-megawatt reactor that would be about one-sixth the size of a full-scale plant. And NuScale Power of Corvallis, Ore., is seeking money for a 45-megawatt plant at the Savannah River Site, a government-owned nuclear weapons complex near Aiken, S.C. 
Gen4 Energy, formerly Hyperion, is also working on a modular design. The Energy Department said in March that it had an agreement with both Holtec and Gen4 to advance the development of their technologies.. 
The Tennessee Valley Authority meanwhile says it wants to build modular reactors near Oak Ridge, Tenn. But that agency has also promised to hold down the number of nuclear projects it oversees to a manageable level, and it already has one plant under construction and plans to complete a second that has lain dormant for decades. 
The underlying logic of modular reactors is that in nuclear power plant construction, there are no economies of scale; in fact, there are dis-economies of scale. Small ones can be built in factories, in serial production if not actual mass production, and this will lower costs, the theory goes. 
Whether any actually get built, or any beyond a handful that are heavily subsidized, is not yet clear. Construction of conventional large reactors than it is achieved.
Still, the small modular reactor might fit a market niche in countries with power grids that are poorly developed. In such countries, the grid often cannot absorb a new full-size reactor.

HEADLINE: Biden Paints Romney as Out of Touch on Foreign Policy

BYLINE: MARK LANDLER


HIGHLIGHT: Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. traveled to New York to praise President Obama as the man who got Osama bin Laden and to paint Mitt Romney as a Cold War relic who would leave American troops stranded in Afghanistan. 

 BODY:
Taking the battle with Mitt Romney to the foreign policy front, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. praised President Obama on Thursday as the man who got Osama bin Laden and painted Mr. Romney as a Cold War relic who would leave American troops stranded in Afghanistan.
 The president, Mr. Biden said in a speech at New York University, ended the war in Iraq, set an exit strategy in Afghanistan, and crippled the leadership of Al Qaeda. Mr. Romney, he asserted, has distorted the president's record and would take the United States back to the go-it-alone policies of the Bush administration that culminated in the Iraq war.
 "Governor Romney, I think, is counting on our collective amnesia," Mr. Biden said to a gathering of about 500 people that included law students and Democratic foreign-policy figures like Wesley K. Clark, the former NATO commander, who plans to campaign for Mr. Obama. "But Americans know we cannot afford to go back to the future."
 The Romney campaign fired back even before Mr. Biden spoke, fielding its own team of foreign-policy advisers who said Mr. Obama had abdicated American leadership on Iran and Syria, downgraded the alliance with Israel, buckled to Russian pressure on missile defense and hollowed out the military with cuts to the Pentagon's budget.
 Mr. Biden was offering a "fantasy narrative" of the president's record, Dan Senor, a Romney adviser who was a spokesman in Iraq during the Bush administration, said in a conference call with reporters. 
 "If anything," he said, "it is President Obama's track record that has sent a message to our friends and allies, be they in governments or be they in dissident movements that want to stand with us, lock arms with us, who are looking to American leadership, who are really left exposed and isolated in a way I have not seen in American foreign-policy history for years."
 It was a rare day of geopolitical combat in a campaign that has been dominated by domestic concerns like jobs and taxes. But the back-and-forth had a familiar feel, as Mr. Biden tried to portray Mr. Romney as a throwback, eager to recycle discredited policies, while Mr. Romney's advisers portrayed the president as presiding over an America in decline.
 For Mr. Biden, who has given five speeches in recent weeks designed to sharpen the differences between the candidates on key issues, it was a chance to return to his foreign-policy wheelhouse.
 The vice president walked through the major national security challenges of the Obama presidency, contending that where Mr. Romney disagreed with the president, Mr. Obama's judgments had been vindicated, and where his views did not differ from the president's - as on Iran, Mr. Biden said - Mr. Romney distorted the policies.
 Noting that the president and Mr. Romney have both called for crippling sanctions on Iran, backed up by a credible threat to use military force, to prevent Tehran from acquiring nuclear weapons, Mr. Biden said, "It's hard for me to understand what the governor means by a very different policy" - unless, he added, it means going to war.
"If that's what Governor Romney means by a very different policy, he should tell the American people," Mr. Biden said, adding that "loose talk" about war was irresponsible.
Mr. Biden also rejected Mr. Romney's charge that the president was "throwing Israel under a bus," pointing to increased military cooperation between the United States and Israel.
The vice president reprised his story of Mr. Obama's lonely decision to order a commando raid on Bin Laden's hideout in Pakistan and played off Theodore Roosevelt's famous admonition to "speak softly and carry a big stick."
"I promise you, the president has a big stick," Mr. Biden said, drawing titters from the otherwise subdued audience.
Mr. Biden quoted Mr. Romney from an interview in 2007 in which he said, "It's not worth moving heaven and earth, spending billions of dollars just trying to catch one person."
"If you're looking for a bumper sticker that sums up how President Obama handled what we inherited, it's pretty simple, 'Osama bin Laden is dead, and General Motors is alive,'" Mr. Biden said. With Mr. Romney in office, he mused, the reverse might be true.
In describing Mr. Romney as someone who views the world "through a Cold War prism," Mr. Biden was borrowing from Russia's departing president, Dmitri A. Medvedev. Last month, he criticized Mr. Romney's description of Russia as the nation's "No. 1 geopolitical foe" as outmoded thinking, more suited to the 1970s than the 21st century.
Mr. Romney's foreign-policy advisers inadvertently played into that theme in the conference call. Pierre-Richard Prosper, who served as an ambassador handling war crimes issues for President George W. Bush, accused Mr. Obama of appeasing Russia by abandoning plans to put missile defense sites in "Poland and Czechoslovakia," the latter having been split into the Czech Republic and Slovakia in 1993. 
Later in the call, John F. Lehman, a secretary of the Navy in the Reagan administration, said that the "Soviets" were capitalizing on the weakening of the American military. Mr. Lehman also predicted that reductions in nuclear stockpiles agreed to by the United States and Russia in the START treaty could be the "central issue in the campaign."
The Romney campaign did outline some clear differences with the Obama administration. Mr. Senor said Mr. Romney would provide arms and other aid to opposition groups in Syria. The president has so far resisted that step, arguing that it would only worsen the bloodshed.
Mr. Romney's advisers also said that he would never have announced a deadline for withdrawing troops from Afghanistan. He would decide whether to stick to a NATO timetable for turning over security to the Afghans by 2014 after consulting with his commanders, they said.
Mr. Biden, however, accused Mr. Romney of reversing his position on winding down the war and said: "He seems to want to leave American forces indefinitely in Afghanistan. He may have a reasonable explanation. The American people deserve an explanation."

HEADLINE: Politicians Find a Way to Agree, and Disagree, on Student Loan Rates

BYLINE: TANYA CALDWELL


HIGHLIGHT: Republicans and Democrats agree: nobody wants to see the interest rates of student loans go up this summer. They disagree, however, about how to cover the costs that would keep that from happening. 

 BODY:
Republicans and Democrats agree: nobody wants to see the interest rates of student loans go up this summer. They disagree, however, about how to cover the costs that would keep that from happening, our colleagues Peter Baker and Jennifer Steinhauer report this week.
President Obama has been touring college campuses this week to promote college affordability, even spreading his message in a slow-jam with Jimmy Fallon. Mr. Obama characterized Republicans in Congress as unsympathetic to college students; Republicans accused the president of playing politics, our colleagues report:
Caught in the middle were seven million college students who will see the interest rate on their federally subsidized loans double to 6.8 percent on July 1 unless Congress and the White House come together on a plan to prevent that, at a cost of $6 billion. For a typical student, the White House said the higher rate could mean as much as $1,000 in additional debt per year at a time of high unemployment among recent graduates. 
Mr. Obama has made the issue his top talking point in recent days as part of an effort to put Republicans on the defensive and duplicate the political success of the payroll tax cut extension last winter. Speaking at the University of Iowa here, he seized on a comment by an aide to Speaker John A. Boehner that the president should focus on fixing the economy.
"This is the economy," Mr. Obama said with indignation in his voice. "What economy are they talking about? You are the economy."
Republicans were equally indignant at what they saw as game-playing, saying that they, too, want to forestall the rate increase. They quickly tried to outmaneuver the president.
Late Wednesday afternoon, Mr. Boehner hastily called a news conference to announce that the House would vote Friday on a student loan bill that seemed to take shape just as suddenly. The proposal would extend the current interest rate for federal student loans for one year. The $6 billion cost would be offset by eliminating the remainder of the money from the Prevention and Public Health Fund, a portion of the health care law.
(The article goes on to report that Mitt Romney, the Republicans' presumptive presidential nominee, favors extending the lower rate, too, at least temporarily.) 
After you've read the full report, we'd love to hear your thoughts. What, if anything, should the government do about student loan rates? Let us know your thoughts in the comment box below.

HEADLINE: Natural Gas Is on a Roll, Executive Declares

BYLINE: ERIC LIPTON


HIGHLIGHT: The effects of the shift from coal to natural gas will be felt for decades to come, a top executive says. 

 BODY:
A "perfect storm" of economic and regulatory factors is driving major United States utilities to rapidly switch from coal to natural gas as an electric power source, the top executive of one of the nation's largest utilities said on Thursday.
 Nicholas K. Akins, chief executive of Ohio-based AEP, said the company plans to retire 5 of its 25 coal-burning plants and shut down coal-powered units at other plants it owns in a shift that collectively means the elimination of about 5,000 megawatts of capacity. The result will be that by 2020, only about half of the power AEP produces will come from coal, down from about 67 percent last year.
 The surge in domestic production of cheap natural gas, largely yielded by the rise of the controversial technique of forcing gas out of shale through hydraulic fracturing, has been a big factor in this shift. A series of new environmental regulations and pressure from environmentalists are also leading major utilities to either shut down older plants or spend billions of dollars to upgrade them.
 Mr. Akins estimated that the industry would have to spend about $300 billion through the end of the decade to expand natural gas power generation capacity or retrofit older coal-fueled plants so they can meet new environmental standards -- investments that it is asking regulators to allow it to pass on to its customers, at least in part, which total five million accounts in 11 states.

 Renewable energy is expected to contribute a larger share of power to AEP's mix by 2025, Mr. Akins said, but perhaps not as much as expected because of a decline in federal subsidies and continuing repercussions from the bankruptcy of Solyndra, the California solar manufacturer that collapsed last year despite receiving a $535 million federal loan guarantee. 
And the once-anticipated nuclear power renaissance will probably not materialize, he added, in view of the Fukushima disaster in Japan last year.
 Domestically, coal mining will be the hardest hit by this historic shift, he said. Last year alone, the amount of electricity produced by AEP's gas-powered plants jumped 24 percent, with most of that resulting from a drop in production at coal plants.
 "Our industry is in the midst of an extraordinary period of transformation and investment which will affect how we produce and delivery electricity - and what you pay for it - for decades to come," Mr. Akins said in his remarks before the United States Chamber of Commerce, 
 At the Southern Company, another major coal-burning utility, natural gas is now responsible for 46 percent of its electricity, up from 16 percent four years ago. That translates into about 45 million tons of coal slated to be burned this year by Southern, down from 80 million tons in 2007, Southern's chief executive, Tom Fanning, said in his own remarks on the topic on Wednesday. 
 Mr. Akins said he was somewhat concerned that the nation may end up too reliant on natural gas, particularly given the history of price volatility of natural gas. The price has dropped from $10.8 per thousand cubic feet at the wellhead as of July 2008 to $2.89 as of January.

HEADLINE: Watchdog Group Discloses Cost of First Lady's Vacation

BYLINE: PETER BAKER


HIGHLIGHT: Michelle Obama's summer vacation to Spain in 2010 cost taxpayers more than $467,000 in transportation and security expenses, according to a watchdog group that obtained federal records. 

 BODY:
Michelle Obama's summer vacation to Spain in 2010 cost taxpayers more than $467,000 in transportation and security expenses, according to a watchdog group that obtained federal records.
 The disclosure came at a time when Republicans were already pressing President Obama about billing trips to the government that seem campaign-oriented. Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, called on the president Thursday to reimburse taxpayers for this week's trip to three battleground states.
 The first lady's trip to Spain caused a stir because it seemed jarring to some in the midst of economic turmoil at home. For the Mediterranean beach getaway, Mrs. Obama took her younger daughter, two friends and four of their daughters. A columnist for The Daily News in New York branded her "a modern-day Marie Antoinette." 
 The White House said then that Mrs. Obama and her friends paid for their own rooms, food and transportation. The first lady reimbursed the government for the equivalent of first-class commercial tickets for herself and her daughter, Sasha, with the rest of the seats on her government plane occupied mainly by Secret Service employees. Her friends flew on separate commercial flights, the White House said at the time.
 But as with every first lady, the cost of actually flying the government plane far exceeded the money Mrs. Obama reimbursed, and security is paid for by the government. Secret Service agents travel with any first lady when she leaves the White House, and they typically insist on government transportation to better secure her. Some aides came along as well because Mrs. Obama paid a courtesy call on King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia on the island of Majorca.
Judicial Watch, a public interest group, obtained documents showing that, based on the normal hourly rates, the cost of flying the plane to Malaga, then to Majorca and back to the United States, added up to $199,323.75. For the 15-member flight crew, the government paid $10,290.60 for hotel rooms, $2,633.50 for rental cars and $876.30 for food, including $57.68 for four bottles of maple syrup and a package of pancake mix.
 The cost of Secret Service protection totaled $254,461.20, including $26,670.61 for a chauffeured tour of Costa del Sol and $50,078.78 for the services of a travel planning company, according to Judicial Watch. The government paid for lodging for a security dog and its handler as well.
Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said he had no comment.

HEADLINE: European Regulator Warns Silicon Valley About Privacy

BYLINE: SOMINI SENGUPTA


HIGHLIGHT: A European regulator urged Silicon Valley companies to innovate in privacy protection or face more regulation. A Microsoft lawyer said no company loses market share by violating privacy. The European Commission has proposed a right to be forgotten,which would allow consumers to demand that personal data, from shopping records to photographs, be deleted forever. 

 BODY:
The European data protection supervisor, Peter Hustinx, on Thursday urged technology companies to "innovate" in the area of consumer privacy, saying that lawmakers on the continent would press ahead on a contentious proposed law that would, in part, compel companies to pare down the personal data kept in their digital vaults. 
"It really is based on the idea that when there is not good enough reason to keep the data, it should be deleted," Mr. Hustinx told a conference on digital privacy, sponsored by the Berkeley Center for Law and Technology, which is part of the University of California at Berkeley School of Law. 
"When data have been published or have been shared and it is within your power to get them back, you have to make reasonable effort to get the spirit back in the bottle,"he said.
The European Commission proposed earlier this year a wide ranging new law designed to protect personal data online. It has met with strong resistance from some Silicon Valley companies on the grounds that it would be costly, logistically difficult and a hindrance to innovation. One of the most contested parts of the law, known as the right to be forgotten, would allow consumers to demand that personal data, from shopping records to photographs, be deleted forever. 
The proposed E.U. law would impose stiff fines on companies that break the law. 
The daylong privacy conference repeatedly raised the question of the value of privacy, with Michael Hintze, a lawyer for Microsoft, pointing out that despite privacy flaps at companies like Facebook, Google and Microsoft, no company seems to have lost market share as a result. "A company may get bad press on privacy but large numbers of its customers aren't leaving in droves," he said. 
Mr. Hustinx was undeterred. "It is true that people behave sometimes in a different manner," he said. "But we get continued, strong feedback for stronger protection."

HEADLINE: Culture Warriors Don't Win

BYLINE: GIL TROY


HIGHLIGHT: Is Mitt Romney learning the right lessons from Ronald Reagan? Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich didn't. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney's apparent nomination proves that Republican voters are more pragmatic and centrist than their reputation suggests. The Republican candidates this year fought a classic political battle. Rick Santorum, Newt Gingrich and Ron Paul campaigned as purists, echoing Henry Clay's famous expression from 1844, "I'd rather be right than president." The realist Romney updated the belief of nineteenth-century partisans that a candidate's most important ability is what they called his "availability," as in "his ability to avail" - and prevail.
Gingrich and Santorum frequently justified their extremism by invoking the modern Republican demigod, Ronald Reagan. Gingrich is just now giving up on campaigning as a "Reagan conservative" against Romney, the "Massachusetts moderate." In March, Santorum visited a Reaganite holy site - the Jelly Belly factory in Fairfield, Calif., which produced Reagan's favorite jelly beans. "They're asking you, people of principle, to compromise your principles and to be for someone who is less corely convicted than Ronald Reagan because we need to win," Santorum said. He had a pragmatic argument too: "Every time we run someone that the moderate establishment of the Republican Party said we need to win, we lose."
Santorum's diction - corely convicted? - is as flawed as his historical memory. Republican voters have rejected culture wars and fanaticism in presidential campaigns repeatedly - they know culture warriors don't win. Despite the talk about the rightward lurch of their party, a majority of Republicans have learned Reagan's central political lesson. A Republican candidate can only win by wooing the center, and a president must govern as a national leader, not a factional chief or a cultural crusader.
Even when it began in the 1850s as an ideological anti-slavery breakaway group, the Republican Party favored more "available" nominees. The first Republican nominee, John C. Frmont, was most famous as "The Pathfinder." In 1860, Abraham Lincoln was the compromise candidate, defeating the zealots Salmon P. Chase and William Henry Seward. Lincoln's strategy was "to give no offence to others - leave them in a mood to come to us, if they shall be compelled to give up their first love." He even made his acceptance letter "sufficiently brief to do no harm."
There has been a more substance-oriented counter-tradition, epitomized by Grover Cleveland's challenge, "What is the use of being elected or re-elected, unless you stand for something?" But the need to appeal broadly to America's diverse electorate has usually prevailed. American voters' weakness for popular icons over articulate ideologues ultimately frustrated even Henry Clay, the conscience of the Whig Party. As the Mexican War hero Zachary Taylor, who had never even voted for president before, conquered his party in 1848, Clay, well aware that Americans loved turning soldiers into presidents, moaned, "I have thought that I might yet be able to capture or to slay a Mexican."
In the twentieth century, Ronald Reagan delivered his best lines as a culture warrior, including the grand slam - "A hippie is someone who looks like Tarzan, walks like Jane and smells like Cheetah" - while governing California, not while he was running for president. Reagan won in 1980 by moving beyond Barry Goldwater's cranky conservatism, which had triggered the Democratic landslide of 1964.
Reagan's conservatism with a smiley face emphasized economic issues. Within weeks of his inauguration in 1981, conservatives were complaining that Reagan's Cabinet was too moderate. Their cry - "Let Reagan be Reagan" - demanded a more ideological and confrontational "corely convicted" leadership. But in compromising and popularizing, Reagan being Reagan.
Nevertheless, conservatives revered Reagan because they never doubted his essential conservative identity. In Puritan terms, Reagan had a "covenant of grace" with conservatives, not a "covenant of works." His salvation came from sharing core beliefs not engaging in particular acts.
Since Reagan, conservative ideologues like Santorum have inspired voters, disrupted primaries, enraged Democrats, alienated independents, but lost. In 1988, the evangelical preacher Pat Robertson surged in Iowa, then faltered. In 1992, Pat Buchanan was only popular enough to hurt President Bush, not to win. This pattern has held, with flareups of varying incandescence from Alan Keyes to Gary Bauer to Mike Huckabee. George W. Bush did not run as the conservative ideologue many saw when he governed but as the Romneyesque "compassionate conservative" whom many on the right at first mistrusted.
Winning candidates need a broad national reach. The appeal of the culture warrior is far more limited than the Tea Party crowd claims. If Americans actually embraced Rick Santorum's worldview, the rates of premarital sex, abortion, births to single mothers, divorce, and same-sex relationships would be much lower, especially in the "red states." But these are not "blue state" phenomena or liberal Democratic behaviors. 
Most Americans are not ready to jettison traditional moral strictures even as many live non-traditional lives. Especially in this election, with no particularly pressing social or cultural issue demanding the attention of voters, Santorum's sanctimony functioned as a form of identity politics, telegraphing membership in a self-selected club of the "virtuous," while churning divisive emotions.
Romney should be wary because culture warriors can sabotage presidential campaigns. When, at the Republican National Convention in 1992, Pat Buchanan declared a "religious war," a "cultural war," a war "for the soul of America," it was President Bush who suffered. Karl Rove blamed the 2000 electoral deadlock on millions of evangelical voters who stayed home because harsh conservative attacks on George W. Bush made them doubt his ideological purity.
Romney also has to worry because when smartphones and Facebook make everyone a reporter and modern journalists can shamelessly eavesdrop at Palm Beach fundraisers, it gets harder to reconcile primary-driven genuflection toward the right with more moderate inclinations. Both Republican conservatives and liberal Democrats will resurrect his most extreme statements as he veers toward the center. But in recalibrating, he will be behaving like most nominees. As one Republican Party founder, the passionate, wild-bearded Gideon Welles, advised his ambitious friend Franklin Pierce in 1852, when Welles was an anti-slavery Jacksonian Democrat: "Be the candidate of all."
In 1984, Reagan's chief of staff, James Baker, offered a recipe for victory that was more apple pie than red meat: "Crime, Education, Economics - Unity." Reagan understood that Americans had complex feelings about many issues. He knew that a presidential campaign was not a Christian camp meeting. His covenant of grace gave the conservatives a popular victory they never would have achieved otherwise. And it taught Republicans (and Democrats) that even in primary season, winning the center and the swing voter remains the candidate's central mission; political purity is useless if you lose.

HEADLINE: The Curious Case of the Telus Proxy Battle

BYLINE: STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF


HIGHLIGHT: The proxy fight involving the Telus Corporation is shaping up to be the most interesting of the year, involving allegations of empty voting, vote buying and secret share accumulations. 

 BODY:
The proxy battle involving the Telus Corporation, the $19 billion Canadian telecommunications company, is shaping up to be the most interesting of the year, involving allegations of empty voting, vote buying and secret share accumulations. What fun! 
It began on Feb. 21, when Telus announced it would collapse its dual-class share structure. The two classes of shares are identical, except that one has voting rights. 
The structure is a relic of Canadian government regulations and ownership restrictions, which cap Telus's foreign ownership at 33.3 percent. In 1999, Verizon, based in the United States, acquired a 26 percent stake in Telus. To avoid running afoul of the rules, Telus issued nonvoting shares and listed them on the New York Stock Exchange and Toronto Stock Exchange. Telus's voting shares remain listed only on the Toronto Stock Exchange. 
 The nonvoting shares have typically traded at a discount. On the eve of Telus's move, the nonvoting stock sold at about $2 a share below the voting stock. 
Telus's plan to collapse its share classes did not recognize this difference. Instead, the nonvoting shares are to be exchanged for voting shares on a one-for-one basis. 
Telus explains the decision by highlighting its organization documents, which provide for a one-to-one exchange if the Canadian government lifts the voting cap. In addition, there are other equal treatment provisions in the documents, including a requirement that the shares receive the same amount in a sale. 
Telus's announcement enticed American hedge funds. The Globe and Mail in Toronto has an excellent write-up of the hedge funds' initial strategy -- simply buy the nonvoting shares, and then short the voting shares. If the share collapse was approved, then the prices of the two classes should converge, with the nonvoting shares going up and the voting shares going down. 
In anticipation of this trade, Telus's shares initially moved in that direction, with the nonvoting shares trading up by 5.5 percent the day after the announcement and the voting shares rising less so by about 2.2 percent. 
Mason Capital, a hedge fund with more than $2 billion in capital, stepped in and disrupted this strategy, however. In March, Mason bought 32,722,739 common shares and 602,300 voting shares. Mason also shorted 10,963,529 common shares and 21,672,700 voting shares. 
The net economic effect of its bet is that Mason will profit if the dual-share class is not collapsed and the shares revert to their former trading value. Because Canada only requires an interest this large to be reported at the end of the month, Mason was able to accumulate its position without the knowledge of the rest of the market. 
Other hedge funds are probably changing course and following Mason's strategy. Foreign ownership has increased so much that on March 21, Telus was required to issue a news release stating that its restrictions on foreign ownership -- no more than 33.3 percent -- might be breached. Prior to this, Telus reported that its foreign ownership was below 20 percent. 
On Monday, Mason started a proxy fight to oppose the share-class change. Mason is claiming that voting shareholders would lose out. In other dual-share-class restructurings, including that of Telephone and Data Systems, which is based in the United States, the nonvoting shares were exchanged for the voting shares at a discount. 
Here, Mason argues, no discount is being applied, giving the nonvoting shareholders an undeserved payment. Mason also cites a research report by Scotiabank, which claims that collapsing the shares will require foreign holders to sell 2.8 million Telus shares, given the foreign ownership restrictions. 
Institutional Shareholder Services, a proxy advisory service, has typically recommended that a discount be applied in these situations, and it did so in the case of Telephone and Data Systems. But in this matter, I.S.S. has sided with Telus. 
In a report released this week, I.S.S. said that the "increased trading liquidity of a single, larger class of common shares; the additional market opportunity from a listing on the N.Y.SE.; and the elimination of any lingering investor uncertainty associated with a more complicated capital structure. ..." mitigated against a premium being applied. 
I.S.S. appeared to be particularly swayed because Telus's organization documents already required such a conversion if the ownership cap was lifted, and that in other situations the nonvoting shares were illiquid, justifying a discount in exchange for the provided liquidity. 
I see Telus and I.S.S.'s point. But the fact that there is a disparity between the two shares, probably because of the voting rights, seems to be a strong argument for a differential premium, even if such a conversion is likely to occur automatically in the future. 
It is here that things get really interesting. Telus is accusing Mason of empty voting. 
Empty voting is when a shareholder buys a substantial number of shares and simultaneously shorts the position in a roughly equivalent amount. The contrary positions mean the shareholder has no real economic stake in the company anymore, but can still vote the shares it holds. 
Telus argues that Mason's common-share position is offset by its short position in the nonvoting stock. The effect is that while Mason owns about $1.97 billion in stock, Mason's economic exposure is only about $25 million. 
Empty voting has been criticizedbecause it divorces the economic interests in a share from the actual vote. This can be pernicious because it means a shareholder vote can be influenced in ways that might harm the company.
But while empty voting has spurred much hand-wringing, to date there have been few examples of the potential ill effects, or even examples of empty voting at all. The most prominent case was in 2004, and it involved the Perry Corporation's purchase of shares in Mylan Pharmaceuticals, which was seeking to acquire King Pharmaceuticals at the time. In that instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission eventually fined Perry $100,000 for a failure to file a timely Schedule 13D report disclosing its position.
To approve Telus's proposal to collapse the share structure, two-thirds of the stock in each class are required to approve the move. Telus argues that Mason will have an outsize vote different than its economic position, and that this constitutes empty voting. Mason counters that it is merely hedging its position, and that its interests are set up to favor the voting shares, according to a person close to the money manager.
You can draw your own opinion. But either way, Mason will have a head start in the vote since any share not voting is a no vote. Mason therefore already has about half the shares necessary to block the proposal. 
Meanwhile, Telus is paying a dealer solicitation fee of 10 cents for each share of Telus stock voted in favor of the proposal. While this is fairly common in Canada, this looks like "vote buying," the person close to Mason said. According to Mason's public statements, the practice, which is forbidden in the United States, indicates that the hedge fund's proxy solicitation has the support of some Telus shareholders. 
All in all, it adds up to quite a ride for Telus -- and for those who have the good fortune to watch these things only as case studies in how the capital markets can sometimes work in odd ways. 
Perhaps this is also a warning for companies, including Google, that have proposed adopting a nonvoting share class. 
A previous version of this post included an incorrect value for the Telus Corporation. It has a market capitalization of $19 billion, not $4 billion. The value of Mason Capital's shares in Telus was also incorrect. It owns $1.97 billion in stock, not $1 billion, and its economic interest is $25 million, not $40 million. Also, the amount of the dealer solicitation fee Telus is paying was incorrect. It is 10 cents a share, not 50 cents.

HEADLINE: Despite Budget Cuts And Base Expansion, Trying to Save Energy

BYLINE: By KATE GALBRAITH. 
kgalbraith@texastribune.org

 BODY:
EL PASO -- Outside a building that provides medical care for wounded soldiers at Fort Bliss, two long, dark lines of hundreds of solar panels stand on supports over the parking lot, moving to follow the sun.
''Everybody wants to park under the solar panels,'' said B. J. Tomlinson, the renewable energy and sustainable engineering program manager at Fort Bliss. The roughly $1 million system, paid for by the Army, began producing power this year.
Solar panels are popping up across Fort Bliss, which is the nation's largest Army post by physical size, covering an area slightly larger than Rhode Island. The panels are part of the base's effort to cut its net energy and water use, reduce waste and thus demonstrate self-sufficiency, a concept that can have a large impact on operations abroad. The military refers to it as ''net zero,'' and bases like Fort Bliss and Fort Hood have embraced it, but high upfront costs pose challenges. 
In Central Texas, Fort Hood has a goal of net zero waste by 2020. The base, second to Fort Bragg in total number of soldiers, will claim success if about 90 percent of its trash avoids a landfill, according to Brian Dosa, Fort Hood's director of public works. Right now, more than half goes into the base's landfill.
Achieving these goals will be tough, officials at both bases said.
''It's really as much about behavior change as it is about technology,'' said Mr. Dosa. Recycling rates at soldiers' housing complexes, for example, are low, he said. In addition to recycling, Fort Hood wants to reduce packaging and encourage reuse of materials like household goods.
Fort Bliss's plans are especially ambitious. It is the only base besides Fort Carson in Colorado selected by the Army to achieve net zero in three categories -- energy, water and waste. And it must do this by 2018 despite a huge increase in size. Because of the First Armored Division's return from Germany, the number of soldiers assigned to Fort Bliss is more than tripling, to about 30,000. Electricity use, for example, could jump by up to 60 percent between fiscal 2010 and 2015.
Solar power is a logical choice for Fort Bliss, which extends from relentlessly sunny El Paso into New Mexico. A large field of solar panels, which will more than double the existing solar capacity, should be producing power by the end of the year, bringing the base up to 1 percent solar electricity.
The new panels will be adjacent to the headquarters of the First Armored Division, where the base's commanding general has an office. ''He's going to be able to look out the window and see all of that,'' Mr. Tomlinson said.
Prices for solar power remain expensive, and cost-cutting has become a watchword for the government. Mr. Tomlinson hopes that construction will start next year on a 20-megawatt solar project that would be two-thirds the size of the largest existing solar array in Texas. The Army is trying to arrange private financing for the multimillion-dollar project.
Solar power alone will not take the base to net zero energy, Mr. Tomlinson said, so he is considering a range of other technologies, including wind turbines, geothermal wells and a plant that would convert garbage into energy. But those projects would have to go through multilayered permit processes.
Some outside experts are impressed with the Army's efforts. ''When the military makes up its mind to do something, I think they can get it done,'' said Doug Lewin, executive director of the South-central Partnership for Energy Efficiency as a Resource, who visited Fort Hood in February. The projects at Fort Bliss, he added, are ''really exciting.''
Cutting water use will be a particular challenge for Fort Bliss. El Paso is the driest big city in Texas, and the drought resulted in just 5 inches of rain last year compared with the normal 10 inches.
Water-efficient fixtures like low-flow showerheads are being installed in soldiers' quarters, according to Mr. Tomlinson, although the Army is wary of associated costs and water is already inexpensive. Many buildings on the base use xeriscaping outdoors, with small rocks and desert shrubs.
Yet the older part of the base, the site of expansive parade grounds and housing for some top commanders, still has plenty of grass. On a recent day, dozens of sprinklers sprayed water across some of the grounds at 10 a.m., when losses to evaporation in the sunlight are high. The Army is trying to change its watering schedules, and a plan also calls for bringing reclaimed -- or nonpotable -- water to the base, but that project would cost at least $17 million and would not be complete for several years, Mr. Tomlinson said.
The base's net zero goals do not include areas related to military training operations, like the fuel used in the tanks on the base. But the military is working on these lines as well. On May 18, Fort Bliss soldiers will demonstrate the use of solar panels for small patrol bases, efficient batteries and other technologies to an audience that will include the assistant secretary of defense for operational energy. Reducing the amount of energy used by such army equipment translates to smaller loads for supply convoys, a favorite target for insurgents in places like Afghanistan.
At Fort Hood, going greener has meant some major shifts. Three or four years ago, Mr. Dosa said, the entire base had one electric meter. Back then, ''you had no idea and you didn't care about how much electricity you were using,'' he said.
Now the base is putting meters on virtually every building and using behavioral techniques to reduce use. For example, the bill for every brigade is now sent to its commander and is discussed in the presence of the commanding general of the base.
''Now we're getting units to be interested, just like they would be if they were in their own home,'' Mr. Dosa said.
Last month Fort Hood turned on a one-megawatt solar installation, its largest, to provide power for a housing village. The army paid none of the $3 million cost; instead, the private housing company shouldered it and will recoup the cost through reduced electric bills.
Still, Mr. Dosa said, ''the challenge, to be honest, is the economics.''

HEADLINE: As Bison Return to Prairie, Some Rejoice, Others Worry

BYLINE: By NATE SCHWEBER

 BODY:
WOLF POINT, Mont. -- Sioux and Assiniboine tribe members wailed a welcome song last month as around 60 bison from Yellowstone National Park stormed onto a prairie pasture that had not felt a bison's hoof for almost 140 years.
That historic homecoming came just 11 days after 71 pureblood bison, descended from one of Montana's last wild herds, were released nearby onto untilled grassland owned by a charity with a vision of building a haven for prairie wildlife. Some hunters and conservationists are now calling for bison to be reintroduced to a million-acre wildlife refuge spanning this remote region. 
''Populations of all native Montana wildlife have been allowed to rebound except bison; it's time to take care of them like they once took care of us,'' said Robert Magnan, 58, director of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation's Fish and Game Department, who will oversee the transplanted Yellowstone bison program.
But with several groups now navigating a complex and contentious path to return bison to these plains, agribusiness is fighting back. Many farmers and ranchers fear that bison, particularly those from Yellowstone, might be mismanaged and damage private property, and worry that they would compete for grass with their own herds.
''Bison are a romantic notion, but they don't belong today,'' said Curt McCann, 46, a Chinook rancher who this month drove four hours to a public meeting in Jordan to speak against bison reintroduction.
When the explorer Meriwether Lewis followed the Missouri River through this region in 1805, he came across bison herds he described as ''innumerable.'' Just eight decades later, a young Theodore Roosevelt noted that all that remained were ''countless'' bleached skulls covering the Montana badlands.
Scientists estimate that tens of millions of bison once roamed America, but by 1902 there were only 23 known survivors in the wild, all hiding from poachers in a remote Yellowstone valley. For decades, attempts to transplant bison from the rebounding Yellowstone herd were thwarted, despite requests from tribes to steward some of the animals.
''I call them my brothers and sisters because they are a genetic link to the same ones my ancestors hunted,'' said Tote Gray Hawk, 54, a Sioux who has brought the Fort Peck bison hay and water each day since their arrival. Their meat, lower in cholesterol than beef, will feed elderly tribe members and their skulls will be used in traditional sun dance ceremonies, he said.
The last hunt for indigenous bison on the Fort Peck reservation happened in 1873. In the 1880s, hundreds of tribe members starved to death on the barren land. Around them homesteaders from Europe began wresting an agricultural living from this windswept expanse of rolling amber in northeast Montana. Most of the neighboring farmers and ranchers today are descendants of those pioneers, and they safeguard their traditions with generational grit.
''Bison is a big issue that could really impact our livelihood,'' said Brett Dailey, 52, who ranches near Jordan.
Today there are three million cattle in Montana and agribusiness is the state's biggest industry, but not a single bison roams free. A 2011 survey commissioned by the National Wildlife Federation showed that a majority of state residents support reintroducing huntable bison to the vast Charles M. Russell National Wildlife Refuge, similar to a Utah herd created in 1941 from the last few bison allowed out of Yellowstone.
''Within this sea of agriculture there is room for small islands of conservation,'' said Sean Gerrity, president of the American Prairie Reserve, the charity that brought the group of genetically pure bison back to a pasture just north of the refuge.
The arrival of Yellowstone bison was welcome news around the troubled Fort Peck reservation. When the first calf was born on Sunday, a rust-colored baby bull, tribal flags still hung at half-staff for a teenage boy who had committed suicide days earlier. Rates of poverty, unemployment, disease and addiction hover stubbornly above national averages here.
Census data shows that around northeast Montana, a prairie expanse almost the size of Indiana, most county populations peaked in the early 1900s and have since dropped by almost half.
The region's fastest growing economic engine, oil production, is proving a mixed blessing. In 2010 the Environmental Protection Agency reported that toxic chemicals from nearby drilling contaminated drinking water supplies for Poplar, a reservation town of around 3,000. This year a schoolteacher from Sidney, near the North Dakota border, was kidnapped during her morning jog and murdered. The suspects are two Colorado roughnecks.
''These bison represent healing,'' said Iris Greybull, 62, of Poplar.
The bison debate has dredged up old tensions between tribes and their neighbors. Before Ms. Greybull, a Sioux, spoke in favor of the animals last fall at a fractious meeting in Glasgow, dozens of farmers and ranchers walked out in protest.
She and other tribe members say they see an ugly double standard in the fact that there are more than 130 private bison ranches in the state, including one belonging to the mogul Ted Turner housing dozens of controversial Yellowstone bison, and yet only the Fort Peck herd has been visited by protesters.
But some say the bison on the ranches do not pose the threat that the wild ones do.
''Unless they have the German wall and a moat with a bunch of crocodiles and piranhas, they're not going to contain those woolly tanks,'' said State Senator John Brenden of nearby Scobey, who has long done battle on the bison issue in the state Legislature.
Around a century ago some Yellowstone bison contracted disease from domestic livestock and in recent decades thousands have been slaughtered in an effort to protect ranchers' herds. At the direction of Gov. Brian Schweitzer of Montana, a few of these bison were quarantined for years and certified healthy. Some may soon go to the Fort Belknap Indian Reservation, about 170 miles west of Fort Peck, pending the outcome of a lawsuit filed by opponents.
''I took a lot of arrows for this, but it was the right thing to do,'' Mr. Schweitzer said. ''If you want to get into a fistfight in Montana, go into a bar and share your opinion about bison or wolves.''

HEADLINE: A Year in the Life of Social Security

 BODY:
The trustees of Social Security reported this week that absent reforms, the system will be able to pay full benefits until 2033 -- versus 2036 in last year's report -- and three-fourths of benefits after that. One of the reasons for the grim new projection is the increase in oil prices, which the trustees assumed are here to stay and will exert a drag on the economy and worker pay for decades to come. Less pay means less tax revenue for the system. 
Whether that and other assumptions turn out to be true, the report is a reminder that lawmakers should act soon to bolster the system's financing -- the sooner reforms are enacted, the less wrenching they have to be. What is needed is a balanced mix of modest benefit cuts and moderate tax increases, phased in slowly, to ensure both solvency and a fair sharing of the burden of reform. What is not needed is a ''fix'' that relies on disproportionate benefit cuts, or privatization, threatening the retirement security of millions of Americans.
Equally important, the report is a reminder that anything that affects the economy affects Social Security and that sound public policy is essential. The impact of rising oil prices seen in this year's report, for instance, could be mitigated by a comprehensive energy policy that reduced dependence on oil. In last year's report, the system's finances were hit by a drop in immigration, which lowers tax revenues, and could be mitigated by saner immigration policy.
With a weak recovery weighing on tax receipts, a sure way to bolster the program would be more public investment to create jobs and foster demand. A bolstered economy would also raise interest rates, which would mean higher earnings for the system's trust funds.
When Republicans claim that the country can't afford more public investment -- or that the way to ''fix'' Social Security is with privatization -- consider these numbers: Letting the Bush-era tax cuts expire for people making more than $250,000 a year would raise $800 billion over 10 years for needed spending. And the revenue loss from making those tax cuts permanent is nearly as large as the entire Social Security shortfall over the traditional 75-year time horizon for measuring the system's solvency.
Ultimately, the biggest threat to Social Security would be the failure of lawmakers to take the needed steps to strengthen the system and the economy.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Indicate Hiring Is Near a Standstill

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (Reuters) -- The number of Americans lining up for new jobless benefits fell slightly last week but remained above levels posted earlier this year, suggesting improvement in the labor market is stalling. 
Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped by 1,000 to 388,000, the Labor Department said on Thursday.
''This was a disappointing number and offers more evidence that the labor market continues to lose traction,'' said Joe Manimbo, an analyst at Western Union Business Solutions.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected new jobless claims to fall to 375,000.
A separate report offered hope for a resurgence in the housing market, which has been a drag on wider economic growth since the 2007-9 recession. The National Association of Realtors said contracts to purchase previously owned homes rose 4.1 percent in March.
The report on jobless claims was the latest example of fizzling momentum in the labor market recovery. Employers added 120,000 new jobs to their payrolls in March, the least since October, after averaging 246,000 jobs per month over the previous three months.
New claims for unemployment benefits fell sharply over the winter, but the improvement has largely reversed over the last month.
The four-week moving average for new claims, a closely followed measure of labor market trends, rose 6,250 last week to 381,750, its highest since the week that ended Jan. 7.
Many economists say they believe that a mild winter bolstered payroll growth and lowered claims for jobless benefits. They viewed recent stagnation as payback for those gains.
But the longer jobless claims stay at elevated levels, the more likely it is that an underlying deterioration in the labor market is occurring.
''It's certainly disturbing that we are not seeing these numbers heading down,'' said Beth Ann Bovino, a senior economist at Standard & Poor's Ratings Services.
Other reports have shown the economy losing a step at the close of the first quarter. New orders for long-lasting manufactured goods tumbled in March and industrial output was flat for the second straight month.
The unemployment rate fell to 8.2 percent in March, although that level is still high.
Thursday's report on jobless claims showed the number of people still receiving benefits under regular state programs after an initial week of aid rose 3,000, to 3.32 million, in the week ended April 14.
A total of 6.68 million people were claiming unemployment benefits in the week that ended April 7, down 87,160 from the previous week.

HEADLINE: Profit at U.P.S. Climbs 6%, But Is Short of Expectations

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
ATLANTA (AP) -- United Parcel Service reported Thursday that its first-quarter profit rose 6 percent, but its results came in below Wall Street's expectations as Asian exports and other international shipments slowed. 
U.P.S., the world's largest package company, said its net income rose to $970 million, or $1 a share, from $915 million, or 91 cents a share. Revenue rose 4.4 percent to $13.14 billion.
Analysts had expected earnings of $1.02 a share and revenue of $13.3 billion, according to FactSet.
Much of U.P.S.'s growth in profit came from its core business in the United States, where revenue was up 6.1 percent on higher volume and prices. But that was offset by a shift toward lighter packages and slower shipping methods. U.P.S. is handling more e-commerce packages from online businesses directly to consumers, which tend to be lighter and cheaper to ship.
U.P.S., based in Atlanta, also said online sales drove some of its speedy shipping options, including next-day air. Ground volume rose 4 percent on demand for lightweight, less expensive shipments.
International revenue was up only 2.3 percent to $2.97 billion, and revenue per package fell. Asian exports have slowed as China's economy cools. And some European countries are sliding into recession. The international business, which had been racking up double-digit quarterly sales gains, has been slowing since last summer.
U.P.S. said part of the reason that shipments from Asia to the United States were down was that some businesses were putting factories in Mexico or other countries closer to home to keep tighter control of inventory. The company's chief financial officer, Kurt P. Kuehn, said in an interview that volumes within Asia and between countries in Europe were surprisingly strong. Some strength in Europe bodes well for the company, which in March offered $6.77 billion to buy its Dutch rival TNT Express, which would be the biggest deal ever for U.P.S.
Revenue in U.P.S.'s smallest segment, the supply chain and freight unit, rose 1.3 percent.
The company stuck with its forecast for the year, saying it expected to earn $4.75 to $5 a share.
U.P.S. and its smaller rival FedEx tend to be indicators of broader economic health because they move millions of packages for businesses and consumers every day.
Shares of U.P.S. shares fell $1.40, or 1.8 percent, to close at $78.25. FedEx shares dropped 67 cents, to $87.55.

HEADLINE: Death Of a Fairy Tale

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
This was the month the confidence fairy died.
For the past two years most policy makers in Europe and many politicians and pundits in America have been in thrall to a destructive economic doctrine. According to this doctrine, governments should respond to a severely depressed economy not the way the textbooks say they should -- by spending more to offset falling private demand -- but with fiscal austerity, slashing spending in an effort to balance their budgets.
Critics warned from the beginning that austerity in the face of depression would only make that depression worse. But the ''austerians'' insisted that the reverse would happen. Why? Confidence! ''Confidence-inspiring policies will foster and not hamper economic recovery,'' declared Jean-Claude Trichet, the former president of the European Central Bank -- a claim echoed by Republicans in Congress here. Or as I put it way back when, the idea was that the confidence fairy would come in and reward policy makers for their fiscal virtue. 
The good news is that many influential people are finally admitting that the confidence fairy was a myth. The bad news is that despite this admission there seems to be little prospect of a near-term course change either in Europe or here in America, where we never fully embraced the doctrine, but have, nonetheless, had de facto austerity in the form of huge spending and employment cuts at the state and local level.
So, about that doctrine: appeals to the wonders of confidence are something Herbert Hoover would have found completely familiar -- and faith in the confidence fairy has worked out about as well for modern Europe as it did for Hoover's America. All around Europe's periphery, from Spain to Latvia, austerity policies have produced Depression-level slumps and Depression-level unemployment; the confidence fairy is nowhere to be seen, not even in Britain, whose turn to austerity two years ago was greeted with loud hosannas by policy elites on both sides of the Atlantic.
None of this should come as news, since the failure of austerity policies to deliver as promised has long been obvious. Yet European leaders spent years in denial, insisting that their policies would start working any day now, and celebrating supposed triumphs on the flimsiest of evidence. Notably, the long-suffering (literally) Irish have been hailed as a success story not once but twice, in early 2010 and again in the fall of 2011. Each time the supposed success turned out to be a mirage; three years into its austerity program, Ireland has yet to show any sign of real recovery from a slump that has driven the unemployment rate to almost 15 percent.
However, something has changed in the past few weeks. Several events -- the collapse of the Dutch government over proposed austerity measures, the strong showing of the vaguely anti-austerity Francois Hollande in the first round of France's presidential election, and an economic report showing that Britain is doing worse in the current slump than it did in the 1930s -- seem to have finally broken through the wall of denial. Suddenly, everyone is admitting that austerity isn't working.
The question now is what they're going to do about it. And the answer, I fear, is: not much.
For one thing, while the austerians seem to have given up on hope, they haven't given up on fear -- that is, on the claim that if we don't slash spending, even in a depressed economy, we'll turn into Greece, with sky-high borrowing costs.
Now, claims that only austerity can pacify bond markets have proved every bit as wrong as claims that the confidence fairy will bring prosperity. Almost three years have passed since The Wall Street Journal breathlessly warned that the attack of the bond vigilantes on U.S. debt had begun; not only have borrowing costs remained low, they've actually fallen by half. Japan has faced dire warnings about its debt for more than a decade; as of this week, it could borrow long term at an interest rate of less than 1 percent.
And serious analysts now argue that fiscal austerity in a depressed economy is probably self-defeating: by shrinking the economy and hurting long-term revenue, austerity probably makes the debt outlook worse rather than better.
But while the confidence fairy appears to be well and truly buried, deficit scare stories remain popular. Indeed, defenders of British policies dismiss any call for a rethinking of these policies, despite their evident failure to deliver, on the grounds that any relaxation of austerity would cause borrowing costs to soar.
So we're now living in a world of zombie economic policies -- policies that should have been killed by the evidence that all of their premises are wrong, but which keep shambling along nonetheless. And it's anyone's guess when this reign of error will end.

HEADLINE: Earnings and Home Sales Outweigh Troubling Signs

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Stocks rose Thursday as Wall Street was encouraged by some stronger earnings reports and hopeful news about home sales.
Those upbeat signs muscled out a disappointing report on unemployment claims, mixed European results and weakness at prominent companies like Aetna, U.P.S. and Dow Chemical.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 113.90 points, or 0.9 percent, to close at 13,204.62. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index climbed 9.29 points, or 0.7 percent, to 1,399.98. The Nasdaq composite index rose 20.98 points, or 0.7 percent, to 3,050.61. 
The National Association of Realtors reported that its index for the number of contracts to buy homes rose 4.1 percent in March. That pushed up the stocks of home builders like PulteGroup and Lennar.
Companies like Lockheed Martin and Starwood Hotels and Resorts climbed after beating analysts' predictions for first-quarter earnings.
Amazon.com, which rose 1.6 percent during the trading day, reported much-higher-than-expected earnings after the close. In after-hours trading, Amazon's stock climbed 14 percent.
Still, investors did not need to look far to find potential economic problems looming. The Labor Department reported that the number of people applying for unemployment benefits fell by only 1,000 last week, to 388,000. Economists had been expecting a bigger drop, and the report stoked uncertainty about when and if companies would return to prerecession levels of hiring.
European markets were mixed as investors sought direction about the sovereign debt crisis. Stock indexes rose in Germany and Britain but fell in Greece, Spain and France. Banco Santander of Spain reported that it set aside more money to cover bad loans, heightening concerns that Spain could join Greece, Ireland and Portugal in asking for a bailout.
John De Clue, global investment strategist at U.S. Bank's wealth management business in Minneapolis, described the situation in Europe as ''two steps forward and one step back.''
''The situation doesn't look as serious as it did back in October,'' Mr. De Clue said. ''But it's very difficult to understand what the market looks like with the need for austerity but also the need to avoid a recession.''
But Doug Cote, chief market strategist at ING Investment Management in New York, said he thought concerns about Europe were overblown. Though the debt crisis has not been solved, he said, the European Central Bank has set up safeguards to keep Europe's problems from spilling across the ocean for the near future.
American companies' earnings reports also underscored the European problem. Dow Chemical and U.P.S both fell, citing a cooling down of business in Europe.
Despite those declines, first-quarter earnings reports have been mostly positive. Of the roughly 200 companies on the S.& P. 500 that have reported earnings, about 80 percent have beat analysts' forecasts, according to calculations by John Butters, senior earnings analyst at the financial data provider FactSet. That is better than the past four quarters, which averaged about 72 percent, he said.
Earnings growth has also come in better than expected. Four weeks ago, analysts had expected year-over-year earnings growth of about 0.1 percent. So far, companies have turned in about 5.9 percent.
Much of the growth is being driven by a few giant companies. Strip Apple out of the S.& P. 500, and earnings growth would drop to 3.6 percent, Mr. Butters calculates. And banks, which have also turned in strong first-quarter earnings, were helped by one-time items like accounting adjustments.
In the bond market, the price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 11/32, to 100 15/32, while its yield fell to 1.95 percent, from 1.99 percent late Wednesday.

Museums
- American Folk Art Museum: 'Jubilation Rumination: Life, Real and Imagined' (through Sept. 2) Having escaped the ugly, West 53rd Street tomb of a building it inhabited from 2001 to 2011, the American Folk Art Museum has reoccupied its old space on Lincoln Square. This wonderful show of about 100 works from the permanent collection samples all the varieties of artistic expression under the museum's purview, from portraits and quilts by anonymous craftspeople to otherworldly fantasies envisioned by so-called Outsiders like Henry Darger and Martin Ramirez. The revival of this irreplaceable institution is cause for rejoicing. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue, at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson) 
Asia Society and Museum: 'Princes and Painters in Mughal Delhi 1707-1857' (through May 6) This exhibition covers the late reign of the rich and powerful Mughals, from whom we derive the word mogul; it tracks their decline, which coincided with the rise of British rule in India. Wall texts describe imperial intrigue and violence, while paintings depict serene landscapes and interiors and exquisitely drawn courtly figures. There are British colonial patrons called ''White Mughals'' because they had Indian families and adopted local customs, and a final section in which the gruesome narrative told in the texts fuses with the images, in the medium of photography, in works like ''Zafar in Captivity,'' which shows the last Mughal emperor as a profoundly defeated man. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Martha Schwendener)
Bronx Museum of the Arts: 'Juan Downey: The Invisible Architect' (through June 10) In the wilder moments of his career, Mr. Downey, who died of cancer in 1993 at 53 and is getting his first United States museum retrospective here, reversed the traditional dynamic of sculpture, examining how humans could affect objects rather than the other way around; administered oxygen to pedestrians on the street in New York in ''Fresh Air'' (1972); and cohabitated as a kind of gonzo anthropologist -- or early implementer of art as social practice -- with the Yanomami Indians in Venezuela. Central to his vision, which drew on Frederick Kubler, critical theory and hallucinogenic states of mind, Mr. Downey also developed a concept of ''invisible architecture,'' which he described in 1973 as ''an attitude of total communication within which ultra-developed minds will be telepathically cellular to an electromagnetic whole.'' 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, the Bronx, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Schwendener)
Brooklyn Museum: 'Keith Haring: 1978-1982' (through July 8) Heavy on the party photographs and punk-to-New Wave soundtrack, this show repackages the mythic Haring -- club kid, Warhol protege and maker of friendly street art -- for a younger generation. But other Harings emerge in rarely seen early drawings, collages, journals and, especially, in short performative videos like ''Painting Myself Into a Corner'' and ''Tribute to Gloria Vanderbilt.'' 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
Brooklyn Museum: 'Rachel Kneebone: Regarding Rodin' (through Aug. 12) Ms. Kneebone, a British artist, has been invited by the Brooklyn Museum to riff on Rodin and chose 15 works from the museum's permanent collection to show with her own porcelain sculptures. She is drawn to Rodin's maquettes, or the smaller models on which larger sculptures were based. Some works recall wedding cakes and Baroque or Rococo fountains. Chef d'oeuvre of the show, ''The Descent'' (2008), recalls Rodin's ''Gates of Hell'' and is comprised of dozens of little figures descending into a cauldron-shaped pit. That Ms. Kneebone's project is installed in the museum's Elizabeth A. Sackler Center for Feminist Art might suggest that you're going to get a feminist flogging of Rodin, but Ms. Kneebone does not head down that path. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Schwendener)
- Brooklyn Museum: 'Connecting Cultures: A World in Brooklyn' (continuing) This eclectic, imaginatively thought-out one-gallery immersion experience in world art, all from Brooklyn's collection and installed in the museum's revamped Great Hall, serves as a teaser to the fabulous collections in the galleries beyond. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
- Frick Collection: 'Renoir, Impressionism and Full-Length Painting' (through May 13) Impressionism, like fashion, is dedicated to the fleeting sensation: this moment's light, this season's dress. Yet the works in this exhibition, which transforms the Frick's mohair-upholstered East Gallery into a runway for Renoir's soigne Parisians, don't at first register as Impressionist. With their traditional portrait format and imposing scale, they seem at odds with the modest plein-air paintings that define the movement. Central among them is the Frick's own Renoir, ''La Promenade'' (1875-6), in which a stylish young woman guides two equally well-dressed little girls along a public garden path. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)
- Guggenheim Museum: 'John Chamberlain: Choices' (through May 13) The postwar sculptor John Chamberlain, who died in December, manipulated crushed car parts into abstract clusters that are both gorgeous and terrifying. As installed on the Guggenheim Museum's curved ramps for this full-dress retrospective, they look, inevitably, like mangled wrecks on a speedway. Yet the show goes to great lengths to extricate Mr. Chamberlain from what he called ''the car-crash syndrome.'' It includes work made from foam, aluminum foil, paper and plexiglass, and it emphasizes the collage process behind the metal sculptures rather than the material that went into them. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Rosenberg)
- Guggenheim Museum: 'Francesca Woodman' (through June 13) Francesca Woodman, the photographer who at 22 took her own life in 1981, is as close to a true saint as the putatively secular world of contemporary art can claim. The dreamy, formally playful and disarmingly erotic pictures she made -- mostly of herself partly unclothed or naked -- project a self surrendering unreservedly to the spirit of art. Viewing this riveting survey of her sadly abbreviated career, it is hard to shake off the admittedly absurd notion that she was too pure an artist for this muddy world. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Johnson)
International Center of Photography: 'The Loving Story: Photographs by Grey Villet' (through May 6) Richard and Mildred Loving, an interracial couple from Virginia whose marriage prompted a benchmark 1967 Supreme Court ruling overturning state miscegenation laws, are portrayed not as political activists, but as political heroes who fell into history by accident. The story began on July 11, 1958, when a Virginia county sheriff and two deputies entered the Lovings' bedroom at 2 a.m. and arrested them, saying they had violated the Racial Integrity Act. Mr. Villet's images represent the heyday of social documentary, but also the midcentury photo-essay format. Ms. Loving later became a conscious activist when, on the 40th anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling, she made a statement supporting the right to marry, whether ''black or white, young or old, gay or straight.'' 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Schwendener)
- International Center of Photography: 'Weegee: Murder Is My Business' (through Sept. 2) From the home of Weegee's voluminous archive, the latest exhibition about this great documentary photographer (1899-1968) revisits his frenetic, formative first decade of work, starting in 1935, when his often sensational images of murder and mayhem appeared in New York's daily newspapers. His penchant for self-promotion, the work of his competitors and peers, the evolution of tabloid journalism and the great city that was both his subject and his audience are emphasized, with fresh curatorial precision and deftly used touch screens. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Roberta Smith)
- Japan Society: 'Deco Japan: Shaping Art and Culture, 1920-1945' (through June 10) This beautiful, surprising and sociologically intriguing exhibition reveals how Japanese artists, designers and craftsmen cultivated their own version of Art Deco, that excruciatingly suave style of art, design and decor that prevailed in Europe and America during the 1920s and '30s. The 200 paintings, sculptures, ceramics, glassware, jewelry, fashion and printed ephemera on display seamlessly blend East and West and old and new. You could almost believe it was the Japanese who invented Art Deco. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 832-1155, japansociety.org. (Johnson)
Jewish Museum: 'Kehinde Wiley / The World Stage: Israel' (through July 29) After earning a master of fine arts at Yale in 2001, Kehinde Wiley began exhibiting his large, figurative oil-on-canvas portraits of young black men in hip-hop apparel. With their emphasis on bright, acid colors and ghetto-fabulous outfits, the paintings borrowed heavily from the work of Barkley Hendricks, although Mr. Wiley's contribution was to push things in a more bombastic direction, hijacking the format of old master portraits. Mr. Wiley's work hasn't changed much over the last decade, although his scope has gone global. This exhibition, which focuses on Ethiopian Israeli Jews, is shown alongside historic paper cuts and textile works he selected from the museum's collection. The result is a fusion of Pattern and Decoration painting with figuration, a mash-up or sampling of historical styles and references. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3337, thejewishmuseum.org. (Schwendener)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Byzantium and Islam: Age of Transition' (through July 8) Concluding the Met's series of Byzantine art blockbusters, this show tells the story of the Byzantine Empire in the Eastern Mediterranean, from Syria through Egypt and across North Africa, as it made contact with (and lost ground to) the emerging Islamic world between the seventh and ninth centuries. Loans from Egypt could not be secured, because of the continuing turmoil of the Arab Spring, but important pieces from Jordan, Greece and Georgia are among the show's highlights. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Dawn of Egyptian Art' (through Aug. 5) The predynastic roots of the grand dynastic Egyptian art that we all know and sometimes love are exposed in this sublime, view-changing show. The most riveting and least familiar offerings are a selection of small objects, painted pottery and figures in clay or ivory that date from 3900 to 3100 B.C., quite a few of which are usually on view in the Met's Egyptian galleries. Here they are supplemented by extraordinary outside loans and elegantly displayed in the Robert Lehman Wing. Sometimes it takes an exhibition. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Naked Before the Camera' (through Sept. 9) This resonant, illuminating if sometimes fraught exhibition traces the progress of the naked, mostly female body through photography from its early years nearly to the present with some 90 images, all owned by the Met. In works variously artistic, erotic, scientific, ethnographic, forensic and experimental, we see a medium stretched by human use and imagination. The male gaze is often relentless, but as time passes, individual faces, personalities and relationships come into focus on all sides; consciousness rises and oppressiveness decreases, which is a relief. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Rembrandt and Degas: Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man' (through May 20) This lovely small show, focused on self-portrait paintings and prints, proposes that Rembrandt was a greater influence on Degas than has generally been recognized. Degas as a young man studied Rembrandt prints, copied at least one and made others imitating Rembrandt-type effects. But a group of four captivating self-portraits at the heart of the show -- two by each artist painted at age 23 -- suggests that the men were temperamentally about as alike as a cat and a dog. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Rembrandt at Work: The Great Self-Portrait From Kenwood House' (through May 20) This late, magnificently plain-spoken self-portrait finds the artist in his studio, brush and palette in hand, contemplating his homely visage. Surrounded by, and generally overshadowing, several of the Met's own Rembrandts, it is among the high points of European painting, not the least for the pale background wall where two drawn circles echo, abstractly and much enlarged, the painter's intent gaze. Its emotional gravity and psychic complexity underscore why Rembrandt is often likened to Shakespeare in his epoch-changing grasp of human interiority. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Spies in the House of Art: Photography, Film, and Video' (through Aug. 26) This exhibition of 17 contemporary works inspired by museums doesn't mention Theodor Adorno by name, but it nods toward his ideas in a wall text, which jokes that artists often see museums as ''mausoleums, places where art goes to die.'' Andrea Fraser's video ''Museum Highlights: A Gallery Talk'' (1989) leans toward the anti-museum view, while a 16-millimeter film by Nashashibi/Skaer, the duo of British artists Rosalind Nashashibi and Lucy Skaer, made by gliding through the Met in the dark with a camera and a flash strobe, treats the museum like a darkened crypt. Lutz Bacher's video offers another museum tour, while the museum appears in poetically distorted form in photographs by John Pilson, Tim Davis and Lothar Baumgarten. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Schwendener)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Steins Collect: Matisse, Picasso, and the Parisian Avant-Garde' (through June 3) Like the family it chronicles, this exhibition is fragmented and contentious with flashes of brilliance. It explores the closely intertwined collections of the siblings Leo, Gertrude and Michael Stein (and Michael's wife, Sarah), casting these wealthy American expatriates as ahead-of-the-curve art patrons whose tastes and social networks shaped Modernism as we know it. And it shows Matisse and Picasso vying for the Steins' attention. Highlights include Matisse's Fauvist ''Woman With a Hat'' and, naturally, Picasso's proto-cubist portrait of Gertrude. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Storytelling in Japanese Art' (through May 6) An uncannily contemporary sense of fluidity, action and emotion courses throughout this captivating exhibition, which traces the Japanese penchant for narrative through hand scrolls, hanging scrolls and books, on to the expanded field of folding screens. The sublime 13th-century ''Illustrated Legends of the Kitano Tenjin Shrine'' -- five hand scrolls never before shown together -- is a must-see. And the show's second rotation of fragile treasures is every bit as good as the first, perhaps better, with even more in the way of radiant color and an added demon or two. Return visits are rewarded. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
- Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Durer and Beyond: Central European Drawings in The Metropolitan Museum of Art, 1400 -- 1700' (through Sept. 3) How do we get beyond Albrecht Durer (1471-1528), the ne plus ultra draftsman and all-around Northern Renaissance master, an artist so secure in his greatness that he painted himself as Jesus? We don't, at least not often in this show, which surveys the Met's holdings of drawings made before 1700 by artists working in the Holy Roman Empire. But the offerings should nevertheless entice viewers to look more closely at the art of Central Europe, which absorbed diverse religious and stylistic influences from Italian, Dutch and Flemish art. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
- Morgan Library & Museum: 'Dan Flavin: Drawing' (through July 1) The artist Dan Flavin (1933-96) is so closely identified with his signature medium, the fluorescent light sculpture, that a show of his drawings is bound to surprise. And it's particularly exciting to find that Flavin was not only a devoted draftsman but also a freewheeling polymath on paper. The Morgan's show includes drawings from Flavin's personal collection, which encompasses Hokusai, Mondrian and the Hudson River School and will completely change the way you see his art. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, Ext. 560, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
- El Museo del Barrio: 'Testimonios: 100 Years of Popular Expression' (through May 6) The city's premier museum of Latin culture explores its holdings in urban folk art, so-called handicraft and other forms of vernacular expression and comes up with visual gold. Among the kaleidoscopic displays are Puerto Rican santos and the winsome cellophane animals, birds and insects of Gregorio Marzan (1906-97). Splendid textiles include Haitian voodoo banners; densely appliqued molas; and the patchwork scenes called arpilleras, with which Chilean women kept hope alive for disappeared relatives during the regime of Augusto Pinochet. An intoxicating, if sometimes bittersweet, vitality is revealed. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Smith)
Museum of Arts and Design: 'Swept Away: Dust, Ashes, and Dirt in Contemporary Art and Design' (through Aug. 12) From the department of unsolicited advice for aspiring artists: avoid dust, dirt, ashes, soot, smoke, sand, mud and lint, especially if you want to make a statement about life, death, history and the ephemerality of it all. The dangers are well-illustrated in this 25-artist show. While formally various, almost every piece trades on stereotypical associations with the entropic end to which we all are destined. 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Johnson)
- Museum of Modern Art: 'Born Out of Necessity' (through Jan. 28) The title may or may not have an extra preposition, but the show itself is a fascinating array of recent acquisitions that have a fairly direct bearing on quality of life or actual survival. They range from classic (the 1908 Dixie Cup) to cutting edge; cover both analog and digital; and include the tiny (the latest in ear plugs) and the quite large (the 1952 United States Army Jeep). Whether born 'of' or 'out of' necessity, the displays attest to human ingenuity responding to human need. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Exquisite Corpses: Drawing and Disfiguration' (through July 9) This entertaining little show includes five products of the Surrealist parlor game ''exquisite corpse'' and rustles up other examples of distorted or disjointed figuration from MoMA's permanent collection. There's much here to amuse, provoke and titillate, though the curators don't include more performance-based forms of collaboration. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Print/Out' and 'Printin' ' (through May 14) ''Print/Out'' presents printed works by 40 artists and artist groups from the museum's permanent collection. Produced over the past two decades, most involve public modes of address borrowed from the worlds of advertizing and design and concepts promoting critical suspicion of mainstream media, culture and society. ''Printin','' a related print-focused exhibition, is full of surprises addressing multiple aspects of human experience. With fearless eclecticism, it ranges from a Krazy Kat cartoon by George Herriman to Puritan stocks cut from cardboard by Cady Noland. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Diego Rivera: Murals for the Museum of Modern Art' (through May 14) This show reunites five of the eight free-standing frescoes that Rivera made for a 1931-32 exhibition at MoMA. Some of these paintings seem ripped from current headlines. In ''The Uprising,'' protesting laborers are brutally suppressed by uniformed soldiers; the stratified New York cityscape of ''Frozen Assets'' tops a bank vault with a crowded homeless shelter. Timely as they are, they lack the multitudinous energy and narrative sweep of Rivera's permanently sited murals. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Cindy Sherman' (through June 11) Aided by ever-shifting arrays of costumes, wigs, makeup, props, masks and prosthetic body parts, the leading light of postmodern photo-based art spent nearly four decades turning photography against itself, laying waste to a lexicon of mostly female stereotypes and exposing both the tyranny and the inner lives of the images of women that bombard and shape us all at every turn. This retrospective could have been larger, more clearly organized and less familiar, but its strengths, like the achievement it honors, are undeniable. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
- Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Whitney Biennial 2012' (through May 27) With remarkable clarity of vision, striking spatial intelligence and a generous stylistic inclusiveness, one of the best Whitney Biennials in recent memory confidently weaves together art objects and time-based art -- dance, theater and performance as well as film and video -- on a scale unprecedented in New York. So doing, this especially poetic incarnation also reinvents the museum's signature show and places future biennial curators in its debt, while offering the out-of-control, money-saturated art world a bit of redemption. Visit early and often. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
Galleries: Chelsea
Tamy Ben-Tor: 'New Performance Work' (through Saturday) An exceptionally talented comic performer, Ms. Ben-Tor dons bad wigs and fake facial hair to transform herself into funny and despicable stock characters. In the best of four videos here, she plays a laughably humorless conceptual artist describing her ''practice'' in the kind of fatuously arid and convoluted language favored by scholarly journals and symposium participants. Zach Feuer Gallery, 548 West 22nd Street, (212) 989-7700, zachfeuer.com. (Johnson)
Douglas Florian: 'Dawn Thieves' (through May 5) In 24 works mostly from the past two years, this artist, who is also a poet and a writer-illustrator of award-winning children's books, successfully shifts from (mostly) gouache on paper bags to oil on small wood panels. The visually scrumptious, jewel-colored results suggest a familiarity with Indian miniatures, Tibetan thangkas, Japanese calligraphy and several varieties of modern and post-modern abstraction, consummately assimilated, distilled and unleashed to joyful, freewheeling effect. BravinLee Programs, 526 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 462-4404, bravinlee.com. (Smith)
'Virginia Overton' (through May 6) Made from detritus scavenged from the Kitchen's basement, Ms. Overton's Post-Minimalist sculptures generate an air of excruciatingly sophisticated decorum. On a squarish wall, a single, 17-foot-long pipe reaches diagonally from one corner to its opposite. Wedged between opposite walls, a set of eight, scuffed, white pedestals seems to levitate. The floor of one room is entirely covered by two-by-four scraps. Viewing these works is like browsing through an issue of Artforum magazine from about 1970. The Kitchen, 512 West 19th Street, (212) 255-5793, thekitchen.org. (Johnson)
Public Art
Josephine Meckseper: 'Manhattan Oil Project' (through May 6) Two pristine, full-size oil pumps seemingly toiling away in an empty lot of the theater district are intended to raise alarm about waste and the environment, but mainly they exemplify Surrealist cliche, highlight public sculpture's all-too frequent role as light entertainment and -- highlighted with red on black -- are presentable enough to appear on the Broadway stage, perhaps in an update of ''Oklahoma!'' Eighth Avenue, at 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 966-0193, artproductionfund.org. (Smith)
Out of Town
- Philadelphia Museum of Art: 'Van Gogh Up Close' (through May 6) Nature both inspired van Gogh's extraordinary art and calmed his perpetually jangled nerves, and this modest yet groundbreaking show of 45 often small, unfamiliar canvases -- devoted almost entirely to landscapes -- examines his crucial connection to its bounty. The selection cuts a narrow, well-organized path through his art, examining the terrains he painted, the often close-up viewpoints he used and the shifting topographies of his paint textures, leading us to the fullness of his achievement along a fresh and eye-opening route. 26th Street at Benjamin Franklin Parkway, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org. (Smith)
Phillips Collection: 'Snapshot: Painters and Photography, Bonnard to Vuillard' (through May 6) The focus on Bonnard, Vuillard and a few other post-Impressionists -- among the earliest adopters of the hand-held camera -- brings some order to an unwieldy topic: the competitive relationship between painting and photography at the dawn of the 20th century. And throughout this exhibition's more than 200 photographs and 70 paintings, prints and drawings press us to think about our own fast-changing photographic culture. (You wonder what these artists would have done with Instagram.) 1600 21st Street NW, Washington, (202) 387-2151, phillipscollection.org. (Rosenberg)
Last Chance
- 'Yuji Agematsu' (closes on Sunday) The found-object aesthetic is pushed to beautiful, ephemeral and mind-blowing extremes by an extensive display of tiny bits of trash, collected from the streets and gutters of New York over the past 25 years and carefully preserved in cardboard file boxes by this Japanese-born artist. His often breathtaking finds attest to the urban environment as a kind of random art-making machine and to the human capacity for appreciation and obsessive focus. Also on display: 100 of the cardboard files from a total of around 500, which further confirm his commitment. Real Fine Arts, 673 Meeker Avenue, at Sutton Street, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, realfinearts.com. (Smith)
Pally Apfelbaum: 'Flatterland Funkytown' (closes on Saturday) This pair of solo shows is intended as a playful retort to Euclidean geometry, along the lines of the Victorian novel ''Flatland.'' At D'Amelio, the hand-dyed velvet floor piece ''Flatterland Funkytown'' surrounds two columns in the center of the gallery with a mossy panoply of abstract shapes. A few blocks away, at Hansel and Gretel Picture Garden (511 West 20th Street, Chelsea), the related project ''Flatland: Color Revolt'' consists of small piles and stripes of brightly hued glitter, each resting on a rolled-out blob of Plasticine, and looks a bit like a preschool version of Josef Albers's ''Homage to the Square'' series. D'Amelio Gallery, 525 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 352-0325, dameliogallery.com. (Rosenberg)
- 'Colorful Realm: Japanese Bird-and-Flower Paintings by Ito Jakuchu (1716-1800)' (closes on Sunday) This miraculous exhibition presents for the first time outside of Japan all the pieces of a famous suite of scroll paintings that Ito Jakuchu (1716-1800) created for a monastery in Kyoto. Three representing enthroned Buddhist deities are comparatively dull, but the 30 depicting flowers, trees, birds, insects, seashells and much more are astoundingly beautiful. Formally virtuosic and magically realistic, they will leave you helplessly enchanted. National Gallery of Art, Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Johnson)
Robert De Niro Sr.: 'Paintings and Drawings, 1960-1993' (closes on Saturday) This exhibition features more than three decades of work by a painter who emerged from the whirlwind of the New York School in the 1940s and '50s, pledged allegiance to Fauvism and Matisse, and still managed to achieve a seductive rigor that is very much his own and a bluntness of scale and brushwork that easily identify as postwar American. His art deserves a more prominent place in the history to which it so indelibly belongs. DC Moore, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 247-2111, dcmooregallery.com. (Smith)
Frick Collection: 'White Gold: Highlights From the Arnhold Collection of Meissen Porcelain' (closes on Sunday) Porcelain lovers will not want to miss this show of domestic ware made in Germany in the early 1700s, but the big news is the new wing, the Portico Gallery, that it inaugurates. The Frick has transformed an outdoor colonnade into an indoor exhibition space. Floor-to-ceiling windows enclose a long, narrow space that feels bigger and airier than its actual 850 square feet. In the small rotunda at one end, a life-size, nude Diana by Jean-Antoine Houdon looks out over the traffic on Fifth Avenue with divine indifference. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Johnson)
Douglas Huebler: 'Crocodile Tears' (closes on Saturday) Works from the 1980s here revolve around a satiric screenplay about the art world called ''Crocodile Tears,'' which the pioneering Conceptualist Mr. Huebler wrote. Several plotlines having to do with money, power and ambition emerge from the mix of photographs, texts, drawings, comics and painted imitations of works by Cezanne, Mondrian and de Chirico. Sadly, the movie was never made. Paula Cooper Gallery, 521 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 255-1105, paulacoopergallery.com. (Johnson)
- MoMA PS1: 'Frances Stark: My Best Thing' (closes on Monday) ''My Best Thing,'' a 99-minute film that Los Angeles presented at the 2011 Venice Biennale, features digitally animated, childlike figures isolated on green-screen backgrounds. In computer-generated voices, they candidly converse about art, literature and sex to improbably engaging effect. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org. (Johnson)
- Morgan Library & Museum: 'Rembrandt's World: Dutch Drawings From the Clement C. Moore Collection' (closes on Sunday) You won't see much of Rembrandt in this exhibition of about 90 works on paper, which includes just four drawings attributed to that master. What the show lacks in star power, though, it makes up for with a keen, all-encompassing look at life in the Dutch Republic during its Golden Age (which corresponds, roughly, to the 17th century). Seascapes assert naval dominance; genre scenes show bustling markets and tipsy taverngoers; botanical illustrations tell cautionary tales about economic speculation. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
Neuberger Museum of Art: 'American Vanguards: Graham, Davis, Gorky, de Kooning, and Their Circle, 1927-1942' (closes on Sunday) This exhibition, organized by the Addison Gallery of American Art in Andover, Mass., reunites the Four Musketeers of New York painting: John Graham, Arshile Gorky, Stuart Davis and Willem de Kooning. For a time -- the 1930s, give or take a few years -- these artists linked arms to defend modern American art against the dreariness and insularity of the Depression. One might see this show as an expansion of the first few galleries of the Museum of Modern Art's recent de Kooning retrospective, with their eerie still lifes and fidgety figure paintings that seemed to collapse abstraction and representation. Purchase College, State University of New York, 735 Anderson Hill Road, Purchase, N.Y., (914) 251-6100, neuberger.org. (Rosenberg)
Agathe Snow: 'I like it here. Don't you?' (closes on Saturday) The artist makes more room for herself at the crowded table of current assemblage by appending the found objects of her dangling mobiles with elements of robustly painted papier-mache. The results are a trifle mystifying narratively, but the new color and bulk are livelier than before. Implicit digs at the overpriced, highly finished, heavy-metal objects endemic in recent sculpture since the advent of Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst also add muscle. Maccarone, 630 Greenwich Street, at Morton Street, West Village, (212) 431-4977, maccarone.net. (Smith)

HEADLINE: In Europe, A Marriage Shows Signs Of Fraying

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
If the European monetary union is something like a bad marriage, what can be done to avoid a messy and disastrous divorce?
Broadly speaking, there are now two prescriptions. One calls for sacrifices and compromises from all sides. The other, echoing the law that used to exist in many societies, is simple: the husband -- Germany -- should rule. Did not the wife promise to obey? It is too late to try to get out of that agreement.
At the heart of the euro system problem now is that most of the rest of the countries are no longer competitive with Germany. They are running large current-account deficits, and the existence of the euro means they cannot devalue their currencies to make their exports cheaper and their companies more competitive.
With no currency adjustment possible, a German central banker, Andreas Dombret, explained this week in a speech in Berlin, ''other things must therefore give instead: prices, wages, employment and output.'' 
The question now, said Dr. Dombret, a member of the executive board of the Bundesbank, ''is which countries have to shoulder the adjustment burden.''
Dr. Dombret's answer is blunt: Not Germany.
''The deficit countries must adjust,'' he said. ''They must address their structural problems, reduce domestic demand, become more competitive and increase their exports.''
Suggestions that ''surplus countries should shoulder at least part of the burden,'' he said, simply miss the point. No one can expect Germany to do anything that might affect its competitive position relative to the United States or China, as could happen if German inflation were allowed to rise.
Until now, Germany has seemed to more or less get its way, albeit at the cost of having to put up money to avert disaster. The other Golden Rule -- he who has the gold rules -- has applied. Faced with German anger, and pressure from financial markets, both Greece and Italy jettisoned elected governments in favor of governments that would be run by ''technocrats'' who would do the right thing, as seen from Berlin. ''Merkozy,'' the combination of Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and President Nicolas Sarkozy of France, dominated European summit meetings.
But now the European political winds seem to be moving against Germany. The Dutch government, which had been Germany's staunchest ally in demanding more and more austerity from the so-called peripheral countries, found it could not get that prescription through its own Parliament. Elections are expected later this year.
More ominously from a German point of view, Mr. Sarkozy's own future seems to be tenuous. On Sunday, he finished second in his bid for a second term, behind Francois Hollande, the Socialist candidate who has been calling for less austerity and more efforts to stimulate economic growth. The runoff vote will be held May 6.
Given the fact that France has its own problems, Ms. Merkel might be tempted to go it alone in ruling Europe. But as one German official told me a few months ago, France is an essential partner because of Germany's ''special history.'' German domination of Europe has an unfortunate precedent.
The day after the French voted, I listened to Jens Weidmann, the president of the Bundesbank and formerly a top adviser to Ms. Merkel, speak to the Economic Club of New York and throw down the gauntlet.
Departing from his prepared text, he warned that agreements previously made must be respected, adding that the necessary fiscal union meant that some ''national sovereignty'' would have to be sacrificed. Mr. Hollande talks about amending Europe's fiscal treaty mandating austerity; Dr. Weidmann views it as sacred.
The European Central Bank's sole mandate under the law is to preserve price stability for the euro area as a whole, defined as keeping inflation under 2 percent. At the moment, with Germany doing well and much of Europe in or entering recession -- and Spain being closer to a depression -- there is no such thing as the euro area as a whole in any reasonable sense. But a central bank trying to live up to its mandate might focus on rampant deflation in countries being forced to slash wages and spending and decide that a little inflation elsewhere -- such as in Germany -- makes perfect sense.
The Germans are having none of that. ''Let us say that monetary policy becomes too expansionary for Germany,'' Dr. Weidmann told the Economic Club, making it clear that it is not German national sovereignty that needs to be sacrificed. ''If this happens,'' he said, ''Germany has to deal with this using other, national instruments.'' He did not specify what those instruments would be.
The idea that Germany knows best -- that what is best for it is best for the euro zone as a whole -- is growing less and less popular in the rest of Europe. In northern Italy, some companies are muttering about a German conspiracy to devastate the Italian economy, to enhance the prospects for German companies.
It may be significant that in the first round of the French election, extremist parties of the right and left garnered more than 30 percent of the votes, up from about 18 percent five years ago. The biggest surprise was the strength of the anti-immigrant National Front Party, which received nearly 18 percent of the votes. Both Mr. Sarkozy and Mr. Hollande wasted no time in trying to appeal to those voters. In the Netherlands, it was the defection of a right-wing, anti-immigrant party that led to the government's collapse.
Anger is on the rise in many countries. That worries a lot of people, and politicians in many countries are now talking about the need to pursue policies that will bring growth soon, rather than in some distant future.
But there is little evidence that the Germans are concerned. In his speech to the Economic Club, Dr. Weidmann conceded that the German prescription of austerity for all ''might, under normal circumstances, dampen aggregate demand and economic growth.'' But, he added, these are not normal times.
''A widespread lack of trust in public finances weighs heavily on growth,'' he said. ''There is uncertainty regarding potential future tax increases, while funding costs are rising for private and public creditors alike.'' In those circumstances, continued austerity ''might inspire confidence and actually help the economy to grow.'' Andrew Mellon, Herbert Hoover's Treasury secretary, could not have said it better.
Germany has been by far the biggest beneficiary of the euro. Its manufacturers have prospered in no small part because the lack of competitiveness of other euro area countries has held down the value of the currency.
Were the currency to collapse, Germany would suffer greatly. A new Deutsche mark would no doubt rise rapidly against other currencies, making Germany's goods more expensive and in that way damaging the country's competitiveness.
I asked one German I know how Ms. Merkel would cope without Mr. Sarkozy at her side. He professed unconcern. A President Hollande, he said, would no doubt come around once he was in office.
The fact that there is no easy way to break up the euro zone -- and that no one can be sure just how painful it would be -- is the best reason to think that, somehow, the euro will endure in all the countries that now use it. Germany's rigid belief that others must suffer to preserve the system may yet make some other country decide to take the risk of ending what has become a very bad marriage.

HEADLINE: An Aging Town In Japan Trusts Its Fate to Youth

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
YUBARI, Japan -- Most young people have already fled this city of empty streets and shuttered schools, whose bankrupt local government collapsed under the twin burdens of debt and demographics that are slowly afflicting the rest of Japan.
Now, Yubari, a former coal-mining town on Japan's northernmost main island, Hokkaido, is hoping an unlikely savior can reverse its long decline: a 31-year-old rookie mayor who has come to symbolize the struggle confronting young Japanese in the world's most graying and indebted nation.
''Japan will tread the same path someday,'' said Naomichi Suzuki, who a year ago this month became the youngest mayor of the country's most rapidly aging city. ''If we can't save Yubari, what will it mean for the rest of Japan?''
Indeed, the city's plight and attempt to fight back -- which has become a story line in the national media -- could offer a glimpse of Japan's future. 
Japan's overall population fell by a record quarter-million to 127.8 million last year, hurt by falling birthrates and people departing for other countries. By 2060, the Japanese population is expected to fall by an additional one-third, to as few as 87 million -- and 40 percent of those remaining will be over 65 years old.
Japan's national debt has not preoccupied the world the way Europe's has. But after years of government spending to shore up the economy, Japanese public I.O.U.'s have mushroomed to almost $12 trillion -- more than twice the size of its economy and the heaviest government debt burden in the world. (Its treasury is able to keep financing that debt load by issuing government bonds because Japan, like the United States, is still a global investment haven.)
But in Yubari, the demographic and fiscal demise is on fast-forward. The city's population has plunged by 90 percent since its heyday as a coal-mining hub in the 1950s and '60s. Currently, fewer than 10,500 people live in a geographic area approximately the size of New York City. And of those remaining Yubari residents, nearly half are older than 65.
And unlike the national government, Yubari has already faced its day of reckoning with creditors. Crippled by the closure of its coal mines as Japan moved to petroleum-based fuels and nuclear power, and after a failed bid to revive its tourism economy with subsidies from the central government, Yubari went bankrupt in 2007, owing more than $400 million to holders of its municipal bonds.
Under Japanese law that debt must still be repaid under a bankruptcy reorganization the city will be laboring under for the next 15 years.
The city's services have been cut to the bone, and the public work force of about 300 has been cut by half. Yubari's winter festivals have been canceled, its public bath closed and its six elementary schools consolidated into one. The aftermath of the March 2011 tsunami further decimated local tourism.
Yubari cut back on its snow-clearing, and its treasured art museum collapsed under the weight of the accumulated snow. There was no money to rebuild.
Even the growers of the region's famed cantaloupe melon, which can sell for almost $100 each, are struggling as a younger generation has left farms behind for better jobs elsewhere. Meanwhile, the handful of companies still here complain of a dearth of workers; all but 4 of the 20 employees at the Yubari Tsumura pharmaceutical plant commute from outside the city.
''Something needed to be done to stop the bleeding,'' said Shizuo Shibata, 77, a retired school district worker who has spent his whole life in Yubari. ''But anyone who had prospects is leaving.''
It was into these depths of despair that Mr. Suzuki, then a 26-year-old public servant in the city of Tokyo's social welfare department, was dispatched to Yubari on a yearlong loan from the Tokyo Metropolitan Government.
By all accounts here, he quickly established rapport with the locals, volunteering his free time to help resuscitate the city's annual film festival and checking in regularly with his elderly neighbors. (Mr. Suzuki concedes he had little else to do during the long winter evenings.) At the same time, the city's younger people came to consider him a generational leader. Mr. Suzuki began to advocate a new way of thinking in Yubari: what if the city could do more to safeguard the most essential public services, while negotiating better terms on its debt repayments with the central government?
He began a door-to-door survey to get a better grasp of how the city's cuts were affecting living standards. He also pushed for the city to set up regular three-way meetings with the central government and the prefecture of Hokkaido, to discuss Yubari's debt repayments.
In late 2010, eight months after Mr. Suzuki had returned to his old job with the Tokyo government, a group of Yubari locals called on him with a bold request: come back to the city, and run for mayor.
''We needed a break from the past, and he represented a fresh start.'' said Naoya Sawada, 44, an entrepreneur and early supporter of Mr. Suzuki who now runs Yubari's revived film festival. ''He's young and he's an outsider, but in Yubari, that might be a good thing.''
Still, Mr. Suzuki was politically untested and a relative unknown. He seemed to have little hope against the incumbent, Hajime Fujikura, a 70-year-old former auto industry executive, or Yukari Iijima, 46, a former national parliamentarian.
Then something remarkable happened in this country usually dominated by the elderly ranks. Mr. Fujikura, hearing of young Mr. Suzuki's intended candidacy, declared he would step aside and settle for a city council seat instead.
''Look, our children and grandchildren have all left Yubari, but Mr. Suzuki came all the way from Tokyo to try to save us,'' said Mr. Fujikura. ''If we seniors don't support him, who will?''
Emboldened, Mr. Suzuki's camp unleashed a campaign blitz. Trudging through the heavy snow and flashing his winning smile, Mr. Suzuki visited more than 5,000 of the city's 6,000-odd households, laying down his message: Yubari can be saved. The Tokyo governor, Shintaro Ishihara, flew to Yubari to cheer on his former employee.
A record voter turnout produced a landslide victory for Mr. Suzuki over Ms. Iijima, who stared dumbfounded into local news cameras. Pensioners turned out in droves to the young mayor's first policy speech to the city council, some in Suzuki fan T-shirts.
In his first year, Mr. Suzuki has moved swiftly, abolishing the post of vice mayor and putting the resultant savings on salary toward medical care for the city's infants. He is moving to sell off some of the city's bad investments, like Melon Castle, a liquor brewery that sits abandoned in the Yubari foothills.
''He's just like a son or grandson to many of us,'' said Machiko Yoshikawa, 64, a local retiree. ''He is working so hard for Yubari.''
Mr. Suzuki has also pushed the central government to shorten Yubari's debt repayment schedule, a move that would free the city sooner from the budgetary constraints of operating under bankruptcy protection. But with tax revenues also falling in the tough economy, debt revamping would be a tall order.
Chronic lack of funds has also slowed Mr. Suzuki's progress. Postponed, for example, are much-needed fixes to the city's only public clinic, a crumbling gray building that lost all but 19 of its 170 beds when the city's finances collapsed.
Municipal workers, meantime, complain in private that Mr. Suzuki has so shaken up city hall personnel that its affairs are in disarray. Supporters of the defeated Ms. Iijima dominate the city council, blocking proposals and hurling criticism at the young mayor.
Critics cannot deny, though, that Mr. Suzuki is making his share of sacrifices for Yubari. He is not only Japan's youngest mayor, but also thought to be its lowest-paid one. His annual salary of 3.74 million yen (about $46,000) is a third less than what he was making in Tokyo and lower than some first-year salaries there.
He was initially refused a loan to buy his home in a 60-year-old Yubari housing project because his four-year term mayoral term fell short of the five-year stable employment outlook required for new mortgages. And Mr. Suzuki and Manami, his wife of 11 months, have registered their marriage at city hall, but are unsure when they can afford a wedding. ''Both Yubari and I have a mountain of debt,'' Mr. Suzuki jokes.
''In many ways, it's not my generation's fault that Japan has so much debt,'' he said. ''But blaming others won't get us anywhere. We just need to find a way forward. It's the responsibility of all of us born into this age.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Escalating Inquiry Studying Google's Power

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD and EDWARD WYATT; David Streitfeld reported from San Francisco. Edward Wyatt reported from Washington.

 BODY:
Federal regulators escalated their antitrust investigation of Google on Thursday by hiring a prominent litigator, sending a strong signal that they are prepared to take the Internet giant to court.
The Federal Trade Commission is examining Google's immensely powerful and lucrative search technology, which directs users to hundreds of millions of online and offline destinations every day. The case has the potential to be the biggest showdown between regulators and Silicon Valley since the government took on Microsoft 14 years ago.
Then as now, the core question is whether power was abused. The agency's inquiry has focused on whether Google has manipulated its search results, making it less likely that competing companies or products appear at the top of a results page. 
A spokeswoman for Google, which is based in Mountain View, Calif., declined to comment.
Federal Trade Commission officials cautioned that no decision had been made about whether to bring a formal case against Google. But the hiring of Beth A. Wilkinson, a former Justice Department prosecutor who played a lead role in the conviction of the Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh, immediately catapulted the investigation to another level. The agency has hired outside litigators only twice in the last decade.
''It's a watershed moment when you hire someone like this,'' said David Wales, a former Fed-eral Trade Commission official now in private practice with Jones Day. ''This shows Google that if it doesn't give you the remedy you want, you're going to litigate.''
Several antitrust experts compared the hiring of Ms. Wilkinson -- who has brought about 40 major cases in government and private practice and won them all -- to the government's hiring of David A. Boies to represent it against Microsoft.
''It increases the likelihood that there will be a case,'' said Douglas Broder, a law partner at K&L Gates in New York and the author of several textbooks and articles on antitrust law.
The Microsoft case in the late 1990s transformed the tech industry, reining in its most powerful company and allowing for the rise of new companies like Google. Now Google wields the same sort of power that Microsoft once did, and is under the same sort of scrutiny.
It has been involved in one privacy controversy after another over the last year. Indeed, the announcement of the hiring of Ms. Wilkinson -- made by the Federal Trade Commission's chairman, Jon Leibowitz, at a meeting in San Francisco with reporters -- eclipsed Google's formal response earlier Thursday to a fine by the Federal Communications Commission for obstructing a separate investigation.
''In an important case, you want to do a thorough investigation,'' Mr. Leibowitz said, calling Ms. Wilkinson ''a world-class litigator.''
Ms. Wilkinson is a partner at the law firm of Paul, Weiss in Washington. She previously worked at Latham & Watkins, where she was co-chairwoman of the white-collar crime practice group. Her work at the F.T.C., which will be part-time, begins on Monday.
''Technology is transforming our society,'' Ms. Wilkinson said in an interview. ''It affects people at every level. As a mother, I see it with my kids. As a professional, I see it affecting our work. And in society, it impacts privacy, competition, our interactions with other people -- just about everything.''
She added: ''Working on the investigation will be a great challenge. I don't underestimate Google.''
No one else was underestimating it Thursday either.
Mr. Broder said antitrust cases charging the abuse of a monopoly are difficult to prove.
''There is a lot of very complex economics involved,'' he said. ''It can be done. But Google will undoubtedly bring to bear tremendous resources itself.''
Any decision about filing a suit is likely to be months away.
''Judgments about litigation are made at the end,'' said Richard Feinstein, director of the Federal Trade Commission's Bureau of Competition. ''We're not at the beginning but we're not at the end either.''
The general issue underlying the investigation is whether Google abuses its power in the market for Internet search. Google controls about 66 percent of the United States search market, according to comScore. Microsoft's Bing accounts for about 15 percent of Internet searches, with Yahoo gathering 14 percent.
Competitors have said that Google at times adjusts the algorithm that produces its search results to lower the likelihood that a link to a competitor or a potential competitor for its products appears near the top of the results.
For example, if Google were to program its system so that a consumer's search for ''washing machines'' is more likely to produce as its top result a link to Google-related shopping sites, that could be interpreted as putting its competitors at a disadvantage.
Questions have also been raised about whether Google has done the same thing with the paid advertisements that appear on the right-hand side of a Google search page.
While critics might say that Google is manipulating its results to hinder competitors, Google might assert that it is tweaking its model to provide the best results to consumers.
''Google's power in my view comes not from its large market share, but from the fact that consumers are unable to evaluate the product,'' said Mark R. Patterson, a law professor at Fordham who focuses on antitrust law. ''It would be difficult to decide in many cases whether the results are exclusionary in a bad way or in a way that helps consumers.''
Google argues the latter, and has said many times that ''competition is a click away.'' When the company announced in June that the F.T.C. had begun a review of its business, it noted that it makes public much information about how its rankings work.
Earlier Thursday, Google formally denied obstructing a Federal Communications Commission investigation into whether privacy laws had been violated in its Street View project, but agreed to pay a small fine anyway.
Online Correction: April 26, 2012, Thursday
This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article published online referred incorrectly to the number of major cases brought by Beth A. Wilkinson, an antitrust lawyer. They total about 40 of all kinds, not just those in private practice.

HEADLINE: A Familiar Divide Splits The Student Loan Debate

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER and ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The subject of interest rates on subsidized college loans, once reserved for the deep weeds of Congressional committees, has touched off a blazing battle between Democrats and Republicans at a volume usually reserved for debates over tax cuts or immigration.
The election-year fight for the allegiance of college students and their hard-pressed parents grows out of a combination of soaring college costs, mounting student debt and a sluggish job market for graduates. This has made a top-tier issue of preventing the interest rate, now 3.4 percent, from reverting to 6.8 percent. 
Under attack from President Obama, House Republicans have hurriedly set a vote for Friday on legislation that would prevent the July 1 rate increase. Senate Democrats have their own competing proposal that they intend to consider in early May.
The Republicans moved after President Obama spent the last week attacking them for failing to introduce legislation to stop the increase -- resulting from a bill pushed by Democrats years ago to lower the rate -- as he went from college campuses to late night talk shows to hammer away at the issue. House Republicans are determined not to allow Mr. Obama to spend the next week, when Congress is in recess, continuing his attacks unanswered.
Encapsulated in this political brawl is the running theme of the partisan fights from the 112th Congress: Both sides agree on a desired result, but they disagree on how to pay for it. Republicans want to offset costs by taking money from a program within the health care law -- itself a contentious issue in the Republican-controlled House -- while Democrats, as they have with other costly bills this year, want the money to come from taxes on high earners or oil companies.
And as in the fight over a once bipartisan bill to protect women against domestic assault, each side is presenting itself as the voice of sympathy.
''For the president to make a campaign issue out of this and then to travel to three battleground states and go to three large college campuses, on taxpayers' money, to try to make this a political issue is pathetic,'' said Speaker John A. Boehner at a news conference Thursday as he leveled some of his harshest attacks to date on the president. ''This is the biggest job in the world, and I've never seen a president make it smaller,'' he added.
The debate comes as student-loan debt, like mortgage debt, has become a major burden on households: In 2010, student-loan debt surpassed credit-card debt for the first time.
For the past three decades, increases in college tuition have outpaced the overall rate of inflation, and increases in room and board have risen even faster. That has driven a substantial increase in the volume of student-loan debt. American students took out twice the value of student loans in 2011, about $112 billion, as they did a decade before, after adjusting for inflation. Overall, Americans now owe about $1 trillion in student loans.
''This is different than a number of years ago,'' said Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, who said constituents frequently want to discuss these costs. ''Ten years ago, 15 years ago, college funding was a significant investment, like buying a car. Today it is the second-largest that you're making.''
In 2006, as part of their campaign agenda, Democrats promised to cut student loan interest rates in half. After taking a majority in the House, Democrats looked at their fiscal limitations and moved to temporarily reduce interest rates for the low- or middle-income undergraduates who receive subsidized Stafford loans to 3.4 percent from 6.8 percent, with the rate reverting to 6.8 percent in July 2012. (Graduate students with Stafford loans pay the higher rate, as do students with unsubsidized Stafford loans. Most undergraduates take out both unsubsidized and subsidized loans to cover the cost of their education.)
Some Republicans have expressed concerns about allowing the rates to remain low, citing fear of default in a poor economy. The default rate for all federal student loans was 8.8 percent in the 2009 fiscal year, the latest year for which data was available; it was 4.6 percent in 2005, mirroring the rest of the economy.
With the lackluster economy and high rates of unemployment for young workers, Mr. Obama had asked Congress to deal with the impending increase, but until this week no big moves were made. The House budget, known as the Ryan plan, made no effort to block the increase and the Senate has no budget. Democrats did try to amend the Ryan budget in committee to prevent the doubling of rates; Republicans voted it down.
Without legislative action, the rate will snap back to 6.8 percent -- acting as a $1,000 tax on new college graduates entering a challenging labor market, President Obama has argued. Indeed, the average student with Stafford loans graduates with about $13,000 in debt. At a fixed 3.4 percent interest rate -- one of the lowest in recent decades -- a student would spend about $15,350 paying the loan off over 10 years. At a fixed 6.8 interest rate, that student would pay about $17,950 -- about $2,600 more.
Representative Fred Upton, Republican of Michigan, said the issue would not go quietly away. ''Most families really do rely on student loans,'' he said. ''I went to a state school; it was $330 a semester.''
Then, he said, ''You could have a summer job and you could do that. Today you can't.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Seeing Positive Signs From Chinese

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER and STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When China suddenly began cutting back its purchases of oil from Iran in the last month, officials in the Obama administration were guardedly optimistic, seeing the move as the latest in a string of encouraging signs from Beijing on sensitive security issues like Syria and North Korea, as well as on politically fraught economic issues like China's exchange rate.
As with so many signals from Beijing, though, its underlying motives for reducing its imports of Iranian oil remain a mystery: Are the Chinese embracing Western sanctions? Or, as some experts suspect, are they trying to extract a better price from one of their main suppliers of crude?
The answer is probably a bit of both, according to senior administration officials who acknowledge that they do not know for certain. But for the White House, which has labored to build a more constructive relationship with China, Beijing's motives may matter less than the general direction in which it appears to be moving. 
For years, China stymied efforts to pressure Iran. Now, in addition to throwing its weight behind the sanctions effort, officials say, Beijing is also playing a more active role in the recently revived nuclear talks between Iran and six world powers -- the United States, China, Russia, Britain, France and Germany. While in past negotiations, Beijing has followed in lockstep the positions taken by Russia, this time Chinese diplomats are offering their own proposals.
''One of the key elements of making this work is unity among the major powers,'' said a senior administration official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss diplomatic exchanges. ''The Chinese have been very good partners in this regard.''
There are also signs of new cooperation on Syria. Only weeks after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton called China's veto of a United Nations Security Council resolution ''despicable,'' China is supporting Kofi Annan's peace plan for the strife-torn country and is deploying monitors to help oversee it. Even on North Korea, which China has long sheltered from tougher international action, the Chinese government quickly signed on to a United Nations statement condemning the North's recent attempt to launch a satellite.
And there is progress on the economic front: American officials said China recently loosened trading on its currency, the renminbi, which could help close a valuation gap with the dollar that has stoked trade tensions between China and the United States during an election year.
To some seasoned observers of China, these developments are less a harbinger of a new era of cooperation between Beijing and Washington than evidence that, at least for now, the interests of the two countries coincide in some important areas. And these positive signs come despite new American efforts to bolster its troop presence and military alliances to counter China's dominance in the region.
''Over time, there are interests that overlap to some degree and differ to some degree,'' said Jeffrey A. Bader, a former China adviser to President Obama. ''The relationship tends to move up and down over time, as if along a sine curve. But the recent story is mostly a positive one.''
With American and Chinese officials preparing for high-level consultations in Beijing next week, the Obama administration is accentuating these positive developments and playing down potential sources of friction like the recent announcement that it would station 2,500 Marines in Australia and the talks it has begun with the Philippines to conduct more joint military exercises and allow more frequent visits by American warships, which both prompted public rebukes from China.
The White House has also thrown a blanket of silence over the role an American consulate played in briefly harboring a former associate of the deposed Communist Party official Bo Xilai.
Speaking at the Brookings Institution last week, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said, ''The cumulative effect of what China has done is very significant and very promising.'' At the Naval Academy earlier in the month, Mrs. Clinton declared, ''Geopolitics today cannot afford to be a zero-sum game; a thriving China is good for America and a thriving America is good for China.''
Mrs. Clinton's choice of words was noteworthy. A new appraisal of the American-Chinese relationship by Brookings concludes there is deep-seated distrust between the two countries. Beijing, in particular, views the relationship as a ''long-term zero-sum game,'' the report said.
American officials are realistic about the limits to cooperation between China and United States. Though China joined in the United Nations' rebuke of North Korea after its missile launching, President Hu Jintao later welcomed a top official of the ruling Workers' Party to Beijing, while another senior Chinese official hailed the relationship between Beijing and Pyongyang as a ''precious gem.''
And North Korea may carry out its vow to conduct a nuclear test. In the aftermath of the failed satellite launching, North Korea staged a military parade featuring a missile-launching vehicle that administration officials say they think was sold to the North by a Chinese manufacturer. While the United States does not believe the Chinese government willfully violated a United Nations ban on military sales to Pyongyang, officials say the sale demonstrates China's inconsistent approach to enforcing it. ''I don't think China is going to do anything to stop, or get to know, which companies are involved in this,'' said Victor Cha, who negotiated with North Korea during the administration of President George W. Bush. ''We should identify a few of these companies, and sanction them.''
China's calculations on Iran are just as complex. It is Iran's biggest energy customer, accounting for more than a fifth of its oil exports. But under American sanctions law, it will be subject to punitive measures at the end of June, unless it shows a ''significant reduction'' in its imports from Iran or wins a waiver from Mr. Obama on national security grounds.
The Chinese government wants to avoid those punitive measures, American officials and Western diplomats said. Given Iran's isolation, analysts said China might also have concluded that it should diversify its sources of supply. And American officials said China shares the urgency of the United States and Europe in preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear bomb.
The Chinese, said Clifford Kupchan, the Middle East director for the Eurasia Group, a Washington consultancy, ''have been bad actors'' in the years of diplomacy over Iran, though in recent weeks ''their diplomatic rhetoric is tougher and their oil purchases are lower,'' he said.
The question is whether China is simply waiting out Iran to extract a better price. With Japan and South Korea also cutting purchases to avoid American sanctions, Iran is being forced to stockpile oil in tankers anchored in the Persian Gulf. Unless it shuts down its oil wells, analysts say Iran will run out of storage capacity by summer.
That is when China's intentions will become clearer. By then, however, Mr. Obama will have had to make a critical decision on whether to exempt China from the new sanctions.

HEADLINE: Intrigue in Chongqing

BYLINE: By QIU XIAOLONG. 
Qiu Xiaolong is the author of the forthcoming novel ''Don't Cry, Tai Lake.''

 BODY:
St. Louis
ONE day, in the early '80s, at the Graduate School of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, I was playing Ping-Pong, brandishing my favorite red Double Happiness racket with exceptional speed and spin, trouncing schoolmates both known and unknown to me. As I was about to leave, a tall one asked if he could borrow my premium racket, and I agreed. That was the only encounter between me and Bo Xilai. I remember it not because his father was one of the most powerful Communist Party seniors in the Forbidden City but because he never returned the racket.
After graduation, I moved to the United States and eventually began writing detective stories set in Shanghai. As for Mr. Bo, I read that he was rising quickly in the party, no surprise for a ''high cadre's child'' -- what we now call a princeling -- in China. I would never have guessed that, this spring, he would be expelled, accused of corruption, his wife investigated for murder, that rumors would swirl of his spying on members of the Politburo, on President Hu Jintao himself. 
A few years ago he became the party secretary of Chongqing, a city of around 30 million in southwestern China. There he introduced the ''Chongqing model,'' in which populist economics, tough-on-crime policing and Maoist nostalgia were combined in an attempt to counteract the modern lack of social cohesion. The program had a slogan: ''To sing the red, to crush the black.''
To ''sing the red'' referred to songs in praise of Mao and the Communist Party that Chongqing residents were once ordered to sing. To ''crush the black'' referred to Mr. Bo's crackdown on organized crime. Some 5,000 people were arrested as a result, though determining whether they were truly ''black'' was largely left to those in power.
At first I was surprised by this nostalgia for the ''red and black'' of the Cultural Revolution. But two or three years ago, at a karaoke room during a trip to Shanghai, I was flabbergasted by the number of red songs being sung. For me, they do not bring back memories of a purer China but of Red Guards, who, in the name of the proletarian dictatorship, crushed those they saw as counterrevolutionary -- the ''black'' ones like my father.
He was forced to turn in one confession after another, pleading guilty for being a ''capitalist'' before 1949. Once he had to write one from the hospital, blindfolded, while recovering from eye surgery. I penned the words for him. Another time, I stood beside him for hours, like a human crutch, while he posed under a portrait of Mao as a gesture of penitence, red songs playing in the background.
In the semidarkness of that karaoke room, while scantily clad waitresses popped in and out, I listened again to those songs. One girl giggled. ''You know what! A sick man got well miraculously singing the red songs.'' Apparently, Mr. Bo's move to turn the clock back was gaining popularity.
Like the detective in my novels, I tried to figure out why. It was not that difficult. With increasing economic inequality, the bankruptcy of traditional ethics, the rise of unbridled materialism, the absolute power of the one-party system leading to absolute corruption, people were simmering with frustration and discontent. But where did Mr. Bo fit in? Somehow I did not see him as a true Maoist but as someone who believed in nothing except his personal interest.
This March, I made another trip to China. It was after Wang Lijun, Mr. Bo's police chief, had fled to the American Consulate in a most dramatic move, and after Mr. Bo had been dismissed as the Chongqing party chief, but before he lost his seat on the Politburo and before we knew his wife was under investigation for the death of Neil Heywood, a British businessman. People everywhere were speculating about the scandal, rumors buzzing like flies at the smell of blood.
The day Mr. Bo was suspended from the Politburo, a friend of mine compared his downfall to that of Lin Biao, the famous Red Army commander who was eventually accused of plotting against Mao and died under mysterious circumstances. Except back then, the Chinese took the scandal seriously; everyone was worried about Mao and his safety. Now they compare the events unfolding in Chongqing to TV drama.
That same day, at lunch, before even the tea was served, my friends were talking in high spirits about the bizarre details in the case. Was Mr. Heywood murdered because he threatened to expose the Bos' attempt to wire money out of the country? Could the huge wealth they amassed be taken back? Was it true that the way Mr. Bo fashioned himself after Mao, playing the role of his successor, alarmed the other top leaders and led to his ruin? All the scenarios spread out among the spicy dishes.
Indeed, life in China can be so much stranger than fiction. Murder, conspiracy, ambition, corruption. ''You should write a book about it,'' a young friend suggested over a cup of rice wine. An American friend had suggested that, too, but didn't think it would work: ''If you wrote a novel with a plot like what has happened, the publisher would surely have rejected it as being too crazy.''
One way or another, I'm sure some details of the Bo scandal will make it into my next book. After all, he still owes me my Ping-Pong racket. When he failed to return it, I remember thinking of a couple of lines from ''The Book of Songs'': ''All the land stretching out to the horizon, / belongs to his lord alone.'' He believed that.

HEADLINE: In China, One Man's Fall From Grace May Aid Another's Rise to Power

BYLINE: By EDWARD WONG; Jonathan Ansfield and Didi Kirsten Tatlow contributed reporting, and Li Bibo and Shi Da contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- When Xi Jinping, the vice president of China and its presumed next leader, returned from a crucial image-polishing tour of the United States in February, he faced an even more delicate matter at home.
A former Chinese police chief had recently shown up at an American consulate, offering what he said was evidence of the murder of a British businessman by the wife of another top Chinese politician, Bo Xilai. Mr. Xi, 58, took part in weeks of secret negotiations over the fate of Mr. Bo, whose father, like that of Mr. Xi, had been a powerful figure in the Communist Party. The two sons are ''princelings.''
But despite their similar backgrounds, Mr. Xi sided with top leaders in deciding to remove the ambitious Mr. Bo from his position as party chief of the city of Chongqing, according to interviews with officials and people in Beijing with high-level party ties.
Mr. Xi did not take the lead in the purge that ended Mr. Bo's political career, these insiders say, in keeping with the political style he had honed throughout his career. He cannily stayed in the background while supporting a process that removed a man who had threatened to become his biggest rival in the next group of Chinese leaders. 
Mr. Bo, 62, was a loud, charismatic politician pushing Maoist nostalgia in a desperate attempt to get on the party's nine-person Politburo Standing Committee, which rules China by consensus. People in Beijing say he might have sought to eclipse Mr. Xi if he had made it, and so Mr. Xi is emerging from the scandal with greater standing as China's once-a-decade leadership transition enters its final months.
''Xi will benefit from this,'' said a former Chinese ambassador now working in the Foreign Ministry who, like many people interviewed during the scandal, spoke only on the condition of anonymity. ''It will make his situation much easier.''
The party said this month that it was investigating Mr. Bo for ''serious disciplinary violations,'' and his wife, Gu Kailai, in connection with the murder of Neil Heywood, the British businessman who died in Chongqing last November. The scandal poses the biggest challenge to the party elite since the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989.
But as the investigations continue, the party is moving quickly to ensure that the leadership transition stays on course. In June, about 400 senior party members, including those in the Central Committee, are expected to meet in Beijing to, among other things, set a date in the autumn for the 18th Party Congress, when the new Standing Committee will be finalized. After the June meeting, intense horse-trading over the committee seats will enter its endgame, perhaps at a secret meeting in July, or possibly at an August retreat in the seaside town of Beidaihe, say people with knowledge of the process.
The party has begun naming the more than 2,000 delegates to the Party Congress, political observers with official connections say. The timetable has intensified the pressure on the party to decide Mr. Bo's fate swiftly, so that the scandal does not linger over the succession process.
''The timing and impact of this investigation is a very pressing matter right now, with the 18th Party Congress approaching,'' said an academic with high-level ties.
No matter what happens, Mr. Xi is almost certain to take over the titles held by President Hu Jintao, while one of Mr. Hu's proteges, Li Keqiang, is expected to succeed Prime Minister Wen Jiabao. Despite Mr. Xi's expected promotions to party secretary and president, many political observers expect Mr. Hu to remain head of the Central Military Commission for up to two years, as did his predecessor, Jiang Zemin.
The rest of the Standing Committee seats will be divvied up between the two main factions in China's system of power patronage: that of Mr. Hu, and that of Mr. Jiang, who is a supporter of Mr. Xi and had backed Mr. Bo.
Mr. Xi has not commented directly on Mr. Bo's case. But Seeking Truth, an important party magazine, notably printed an earlier speech of his the day after Mr. Bo was dismissed from his post in March. ''Strict discipline is a strong guarantee for the maintenance of the purity of the party,'' Mr. Xi said.
The Xi and Bo families are mirror images in the Communist pantheon. Mr. Xi's father, Xi Zhongxun, was a revolutionary hero purged by Mao who ended his career as one of Deng Xiaoping's favored reformers. Mr. Bo's father, Bo Yibo, was also purged and came back into power, but earned a reputation among party elites as a back-stabber.
Their sons inherited their personalities. Even the third generations are a study in contrast: Xi Jinping's daughter, Xi Mingze, maintains a low profile as an undergraduate at Harvard, while Bo Xilai's younger son, Bo Guagua, is known for his grandiose lifestyle as a graduate student there.
Besides giving Mr. Xi more confidence in taking the crown, the scandal over Mr. Bo could affect the succession process in another way -- it might push the party to carry out more consultative procedures as it selects new members for the 25-member Politburo and its Standing Committee.
''Particularly in the wake of the Bo Xilai case, there is more pressure on them to make it more transparent, to give it more legitimacy,'' said Cheng Li, a scholar of Chinese politics at the Brookings Institution. ''The leaders are quite weak. They need to find some sources to make them look strong.''
Chinese officials might bolster a system of conducting straw polls among party elites that they began years ago. In 2007, at a meeting of the Central Committee and other senior party members, attendees were asked to name the people they thought should be promoted to the Politburo. Mr. Xi got the most votes, followed by Mr. Li, and that helped build the rationale for giving them their current status. Some say Zeng Qinghong, a powerful ally of Mr. Jiang, phrased the poll question in a way that would help ensure that Mr. Xi came out on top.
Party leaders are likely to hold the same kind of poll at the large session in June, to lend legitimacy to the front-runners for Politburo and Standing Committee seats, according to experts on the ins and outs of elite Communist Party politics.
If the scandal had not erupted, it is unclear how hard Mr. Jiang, 85, would have tried to push Mr. Bo for a Standing Committee post, particularly after top leaders learned that Mr. Bo had been engaged in a wiretapping campaign of officials visiting Chongqing.
Mr. Jiang has several strong candidates to fill the seats that will be allotted to his faction. Among that camp's favorites for promotion are Yu Zhengsheng, party secretary of Shanghai; Zhang Gaoli, party secretary of Tianjin; and Zhang Dejiang, a vice prime minister who was sent to Chongqing in March to fill Mr. Bo's position as party chief. Each of their chances to make the Standing Committee has improved now that Mr. Bo has been eliminated as a rival for one of the seats allotted to Mr. Jiang's faction, which Mr. Li, the analyst, asserts has become one of princelings.
Mr. Jiang's meeting in Beijing last week with Howard Schultz, chief executive of Starbucks, has been widely interpreted as a way for him to broadcast, just through word of his appearance, that he is healthy and deeply involved in decisions over Mr. Bo and the leadership transition.
In the aftermath of Mr. Bo's fall, there is more talk of the chances for promotion of Wang Yang, the party chief of Guangdong Province who is associated with Hu Jintao's faction, dominated by former Communist Youth League officials. Mr. Wang, whose economic model in Guangdong was seen by some party intellectuals as a challenge to that of Mr. Bo's in Chongqing, is now believed by some analysts to be an almost certain pick for the Standing Committee.
As the speculation swirls, Mr. Xi, perhaps more assured in his future path, is carrying out his normal duties as vice president. On Wednesday, he met in Beijing with Robert A. Iger, chief executive of the Walt Disney Company. The encounter, which took place as the United States government is investigating Hollywood studios for paying bribes in China, was noted Thursday on the front page of People's Daily, the Communist Party mouthpiece.
Like those of other leaders, Mr. Xi's official meetings are often recorded in the state news media. But one has been struck from the public record. In December 2010, Mr. Xi flew to Chongqing to meet with Mr. Bo. At the time, many people speculated that Mr. Xi was trying to build up an alliance with his fellow princeling and rival. Now, the report of that meeting by Xinhua, the state news agency, has vanished from Xinhua's Web site.

HEADLINE: Move on Oil Company Draws Praise in Argentina, Where Growth Continues

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Charles Newbery and Emily Schmall contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BUENOS AIRES -- President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner of Argentina has incurred the wrath of the European Union by expropriating a controlling stake in YPF S.A., the oil and gas company owned by the Spanish energy giant Repsol, prompting retaliatory salvos in a budding trans-Atlantic trade war.
But for many Argentines, the nationalization does not go far enough.
''They should expropriate 100 percent, not just a part of it,'' said Fernando Solanas, a congressman and filmmaker who belongs to an opposition party. ''Oil is a public interest.'' 
In seizing control of YPF, Mrs. Kirchner has adroitly shifted attention away from her country's soaring inflation, capital flight and her own falling approval ratings, focusing instead on a longstanding subject of resentment here: the market-oriented policies of the 1990s, which preceded a severe economic crisis at the start of the last decade.
The nationalization has been so warmly received here that Argentina's Senate voted 63 to 3 early Thursday to take control of YPF, the country's leading energy company, during a lengthy special session in which most senators used their allotted time to laud Mrs. Kirchner's initiative. Some members of the political opposition from oil and gas-producing provinces came close to tears expressing gratitude for the measure. The expropriation bill will be taken up on May 3 by Argentina's lower house of Congress, where it is also expected to pass by a large margin.
Even Carlos Menem, the former president who oversaw the start of YPF's privatization in 1992, now supports the takeover. ''The scenario has changed,'' said Mr. Menem, now a senator.
To critics here and abroad, the nationalization -- and the readiness of many Argentines to invite a clash with Spain, one of their nation's largest trading partners -- is the kind of step that has made Argentina seem like a ''truant of economic management,'' in the words of Walter Molano, an American financial expert.
Indeed, some here contend that Argentina has gone to the dogs, literally. So many nervous citizens have taken their money out of the country that Argentina's tax agency now uses Labrador retrievers trained to detect the ink used to print dollar bills in an effort to stanch capital flight at the airports, ferry terminal and bus terminal in Buenos Aires.
''It's a marvel to watch them,'' Ariel Viola, a tax agent at the Buquebus terminal, where ferries travel to Uruguay, said of the dogs. ''They're incredibly effective. They've smelled out millions of dollars travelers were attempting to smuggle.''
Capital flight accelerated to $22 billion in 2011 as fears spread over soaring inflation. Unofficial measures suggest that annual inflation is between 20 percent and 25 percent. But the authorities have fined researchers for disseminating such figures, and the official estimate stands at 9.8 percent.
Dollar-sniffing dogs and fines for publishing statistics might point to an economy in crisis. But Argentina's is growing robustly, albeit at a slower pace than in recent years. A decade-long recovery has given Mrs. Kirchner broad support to pursue nationalist policies that sometimes perplex -- and enrage -- foreign banks, companies and governments, not to mention some Argentines who view her moves as a return to the protectionism that long hobbled the economy.
Riding an export boom for commodities like soybeans, Argentina's economy grew at an average rate of 7.7 percent from 2004 to 2010, almost twice the average annual growth of 4.3 percent in Chile, a country often cited as a model for economic policies, over the same period.
Some controversy also swirls over the way Argentina officially measures economic growth, which the government said reached 9.2 percent in 2011. But even the I.M.F. sees Argentina growing 4.2 percent this year, a rate outstripping the 3 percent growth foreseen for Brazil, the region's economic powerhouse.
Argentina's postcollapse boom underscores the shifting fortunes on both sides of the Atlantic. Thousands of young Spanish emigrants have recently made their way to Buenos Aires; in the hipster restaurants of the city's Palermo district, Spanish accents are heard among the wait staff and bartenders.
After Mrs. Kirchner was elected in 2007, succeeding her husband, Nestor Kirchner, as president, she increased social spending on programs like the ''universal allocation per child,'' which provides poor families with monthly cash stipends.
These programs, along with other antipoverty initiatives, reduced inequality, helping Mrs. Kirchner cruise to re-election in 2011. At the same time, the buying power of Argentines soared as incomes climbed and the government maintained controls on energy prices.
Meanwhile, YPF and other oil companies, wary of investing in a country where low energy prices curb profitability, limited spending that could have lifted energy production. The result: Argentina went from being an energy exporter to importing fuel from countries as far away as Qatar.
This reliance on foreign energy sources grew acute in the past year. The authorities now struggle with a $3 billion energy deficit to meet domestic demand for oil and natural gas, according to Esteban Fernandez Medrano, an independent economist.
In addition to giving the government more control over Argentina's energy industry, seizing YPF from Repsol also allows Mrs. Kirchner to tap into lingering bitterness over the policies that allowed many state companies to be sold more than a decade ago to private investors.
This sentiment, described as ''anti-noventista'' (roughly ''anti-1990s''), is symbolized by the rise of La Campora, a nationalist youth organization led by Mrs. Kirchner's 34-year-old son, Maximo. Members of La Campora now hold supervisory or senior management positions in nationalized companies like YPF and the state airline.
But the nation is also sharply divided politically, as symbolized by Mrs. Kirchner's clashes with two leading newspapers, Clarin and La Nacion, and her strengthening of an array of pro-government media organizations. Some here question whether the nationalizations, which have already encompassed seven companies in the two Kirchner administrations, will stop at YPF.
One company in Mrs. Kirchner's cross hairs is Papel Prensa, Argentina's only newsprint manufacturer. A new law calling newsprint a ''commodity of public interest'' allows the government to increase its stake in Papel Prensa, potentially taking control of the company away from Clarin and La Nacion.
''We're extremely concerned by the government's maneuvering on this issue,'' said Eduardo Lomanto, La Nacion's director. ''It fits within a systematic plan for the domination of the media.''
Broadly popular social policies, like keeping energy prices low, have pleased Mrs. Kirchner's constituents. But they come with costs, as reflected in Argentina's yawning energy imports and the nationalization of YPF.
Galloping inflation is yet another cost, and price increases are absorbed largely by people without the means to try slipping packages of dollars past the dogs at the ferry terminal.
Ramona Gonzalez, 43, a maid who lives in Florencio Varela, a city on the southern outskirts of Buenos Aires, said she was well aware of the state takeover of YPF. ''What is Argentine should be Argentine.''
But she has other concerns. ''Inflation is what is worrying me the most, not YPF,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Group Criticizes Cost Of First Lady's Vacation

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
Michelle Obama's summer vacation to Spain in 2010 cost taxpayers more than $467,000 in transportation and security expenses, according to a watchdog group that obtained federal records. 
The disclosure came at a time when Republicans were already pressing President Obama about billing trips to the government that seem campaign-oriented. Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, called on the president Thursday to reimburse taxpayers for this week's trip to three battleground states.
The first lady's trip to Spain caused a stir because it seemed jarring to some in the midst of economic turmoil at home. For the Mediterranean beach getaway, Mrs. Obama took her younger daughter, two friends and four of their daughters. A columnist for The Daily News in New York branded her ''a modern-day Marie Antoinette.''
The White House said then that Mrs. Obama and her friends paid for their own rooms, food and transportation. The first lady reimbursed the government for the equivalent of first-class commercial tickets for herself and her daughter, Sasha, with the rest of the seats on her government plane occupied mainly by Secret Service employees. Her friends flew on separate commercial flights, the White House said at the time.
But as with every first lady, the cost of actually flying the government plane far exceeded the money Mrs. Obama reimbursed, and security is paid for by the government. Secret Service agents travel with any first lady when she leaves the White House, and they typically insist on government transportation to better secure her. Some aides came along as well because Mrs. Obama paid a courtesy call on King Juan Carlos I and Queen Sofia on the island of Majorca.
Judicial Watch, a public interest group that considers Mr. Obama a 'corrupt politician,' obtained documents showing that, based on the normal hourly rates, the cost of flying the plane to Malaga, then to Majorca and back to the United States, added up to $199,323.75. For the 15-member flight crew, the government paid $10,290.60 for hotel rooms, $2,633.50 for rental cars and $876.30 for food, including $57.68 for four bottles of maple syrup and a package of pancake mix.
The cost of Secret Service protection totaled $254,461.20, including $26,670.61 for a chauffeured tour of Costa del Sol and $50,078.78 for the services of a travel planning company, according to Judicial Watch. The government paid for lodging for a security dog and its handler as well.
Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said he had no comment.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HIGHLIGHT: The International Monetary Fund is raising cash from emerging economies including India. 

 BODY:
Most Americans paid no attention last weekend when the International Monetary Fund announced it was well on its way to roughly doubling the money that it can lend to troubled countries - what the organization calls a $430 billion increase in the "global firewall," Simon Johnson writes in the Economix blog of The New York Times.
"The United States declined to take part in this round of fund-raising, so the monetary fund has instead sought commitments from Europe, Japan, India and other larger emerging markets," Mr. Johnson writes. 
At first glance, this might seem like a free pass for the United States, he writes. "The additional monetary fund lending capacity is available to euro zone countries that now face pressure, like Spain or Italy, so it might seem that global financial stability is increased without any cost to the American taxpayer."
"But such an interpretation mistakes what is really happening - and actually represents a much broader problem with our budgetary thinking," he writes.

HEADLINE: How Richer States Finance Poorer Ones

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: A plan for helping the indebted nations of the euro zone may find a model in a currency union of a different sort, the United States, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
From time to time I attend symposiums on the euro crisis. I find the topic fascinating in its own right, and it also provides therapeutic relief from the dreariness of health policy in the United States. In comparison with international banking and finance, the American health sector is functioning rather well.
The discourse on the euro crisis is dominated by experts who come from the world of finance; these experts seek a solution in "financial stability." To them, that means shielding major international banks from the fate of Lehman Brothers, however recklessly these banks may have mismanaged their loan portfolios. 
Furthermore, it means that interest rates on sovereign debt should be kept artificially low, lest they push the already deeply indebted peripheral nations of Europe - Greece, Italy, Spain, Portugal and Ireland - even further into the debt trap that their public or private sectors had busily built for them during the last decade, abetted by reckless bankers inside the countries and abroad.
To achieve this "financial stability," a standby pool of money between 1 trillion and 2 trillion euros is said to be needed now to prop up the price of the risky sovereign of the periphery and thus to keep interest on it lower than it would otherwise be.

Naturally, assembling that pool of funds from other nations - notably Germany - is a major political challenge. 
From their discussions, one gains the impression that finance experts view "financial stability" almost as an end in itself rather than a means to an end. After all, money is not a real resource. It merely is the terrestrial analogue of the Force by which Jedi knights in the "Star Wars" films could move real things with their minds. On Earth, money merely moves real resources - sometimes through the souls and votes of politicians, as my fellow blogger Simon Johnson has noted - much as magnetic force can move paper clips. 
Viewed from the perspective of the real economy, then, "financial stability" has become code for sizable and long-term transfers of real resources from the hitherto better-managed, more productive and internationally more competitive European economies to the heavily indebted countries in the euro club. The latter will ultimately have to be forgiven much of the debt they will have accumulated. 
It would not be amiss to call these transfers welfare payments. 
Now, it can be and has been asserted that the designated donor countries - again, notably Germany - owe these transfers to the peripheral countries. 
By this thesis, the donor countries have benefited from more than a decade of European currency union, which effectively enhanced their international price-competitiveness vis--vis the peripheral countries relative to the old system of national currencies. At least one economist went so far as to call Germany "the vampire squid of Europe." 
Be that as it may, persuading the citizenry of the donor countries of this thesis - and the sustained transfers of real wealth that it requires - is a major political challenge, which many Americans and their news media routinely seem to underestimate. 
All of which must make an American wonder how we have been able to flourish in a currency union - the United States dollar zone - so well and for so long. 
Here we have three advantages not yet achieved by Europeans, if ever they can achieve them. 
First, we have a high degree of fiscal integration in this country that goes along with its elected central government. That federal government can directly tax citizens in the states.
Second, the constitutions of most of the states require balanced operating budgets (as distinct from capital budgets, which properly tend to be debt-financed). While clever accountants and governors can always find ways around this stricture at the margins - by booking some operating expenditures as capital expenditures - the budget constraints do help to enforce fiscal discipline at the state level. 
Third, and most important, we have found a number of camouflaged vehicles through which we can indirectly make sizable transfers of real wealth among the states, without exciting the citizenry by booking them as explicit transfers. 
Chief among these are Medicaid and Medicare, as Bruce Vladeck notes in his classic paper, "The Political Economy of Medicare." There is also vast military spending, along with sundry other federal programs directing federal money to the states. 
The table below, based on data regularly assembled by the nonpartisan Tax Foundation, convey a feel for the direction of these transfers. The data clearly identify donor and recipient states.
Readers contemplating the table will discover in it a certain paradox - that those residents who most often denounce big government and call for sharp cuts in government spending often benefit themselves from such spending or live in regions that receive significant government support. This was also noted by the Tax Foundation. In presenting the data in the form of a geographic map, the foundation wryly observes:
As you can see from the map, states that get the "worst deal" - that is, have the lowest ratio of federal spending to taxes paid - are generally high-income states either on the coasts or with robust urban areas (such as Illinois and Minnesota). Perhaps not coincidentally, these "donor" states also tend to vote for Democrat candidates in national elections. Similarly, many states that get the "best deal" are lower-income states in the Midwest and South with expansive rural areas that tend to vote Republican.
In an illuminating article, "Even Critics of Safety Net Increasingly Depend on It," Binyamin Appelbaum and Robert Gebeloff of The New York Times note this as well. The article comes with interactive charts and video clips of interviews with residents of the heartland. I encourage readers of this blog to spend some time with that article. 
Of particular interest in that article is an interactive map that shows the incidence of government benefits by county, in total and broken down by type of program. One can click on a county to discover the amount of transfer income per capita in the county and the fraction of the county's income represented by transfer payments. It appears that there are quite a few Greeces within the American borders.
One wonders, though, what would happen to the economies of the "best deal" states in the chart above, and in the "best deal" counties in the interactive map, if the federal government carried out the drastic spending cuts of which there is so much talk in this election campaign season. 
The ensuing austerity might be no more welcome here than it is in Europe.

HEADLINE: New Bankruptcy Documents Reveal Outsize Pay at Lehman Before Collapse

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: New documents from the Lehman bankruptcy case reveal the extraordinary compensation bestowed upon dozens of the bank's employees in the years leading up to the investment bank's demise in September 2008. 

 BODY:
It is no secret that Richard S. Fuld Jr., the former chief executive of Lehman Brothers, and his fellow officers earned hundreds of millions of dollars in the years leading up to the bank's collapse.
But new documents from the Lehman bankruptcy case reveal the extraordinary compensation bestowed on dozens of the bank's employees in the years leading up to its demise in September 2008. 
Wall Street critics blame the outsize salaries of bank employees as a core reason for the global financial crisis, arguing that the promise of large pay packages led to excessive risk taking. While the compensation for a handful of Lehman executives like Mr. Fuld had previously been known, the documents reveal the compensation for the 50 highest-paid employees. 
Robert Millard, the head of Lehman's proprietary trading operations -- the group that traded the bank's own money -- was in line to make $51.3 million in 2007, making him the highest-paid employee on a list of the top-50 paid employees that year. The list shows that he was paid $44.5 million in 2006 and $3.8 million in 2005. Mr. Millard now runs Realm Partners, a hedge fund in New York.
The $51.3 million paid to Mr. Millard approximates the pay package received by Mr. Fuld that year, which, depending on how it was calculated, was worth $40 million to $51.6 million. 
No. 2 on the employee list was Marvin Schwartz, the low-profile, legendary money manager at Lehman's Neuberger Berman unit. He was paid $31.2 million in 2007, $27 million the year before and $14.8 million in 2005. Mr. Schwartz is still at Neuberger, which spun out of Lehman and is now an independent, privately held company. 
The bronze medal for Lehman employee pay in 2007 was Jonathan Hoffman, who is listed as trading "global rates," which is trading in government bonds and more complex instruments including derivatives tied to interest rates. It is unclear where Mr. Hoffman works today. 
The bankruptcy documents also include a presentation to the board's compensation committee in January 2008 and the compensation review process for the firm's equity research personnel. It is unclear how much of this compensation was paid in Lehman stock, which soon turned out to be worthless.
The documents were earlier reported on by The Los Angeles Times. A Lehman spokeswoman had confirmed their authenticity to DealBook.

HEADLINE: The Service-Sector Mystery

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Why is service spending growing so slowly in the United States, at least according to the G.D.P. numbers, even though service companies say business has been getting better for some time? It's not clear. 

 BODY:
The G.D.P. figure for the first quarter -- growth at an annual rate of 2.2 percent -- is disappointing, even if it could reflect cautious estimates that will be revised in coming months as more data comes in.
Among the more interesting -- and perhaps questionable -- long-term trends has been the very slow growth in service businesses. Real spending on personal services -- everything from health care to transportation -- rose at an annual rate of only 1.2 percent in the quarter, and is up just 3.2 percent since the end of the recession in the second quarter of 2009. 
Before the recession that began in 2007, real spending on services had never grown less than 4.2 percent over a comparable period -- whether in boom or bust. That low was set in the deep double-dip recession of the early 1980s, not in a period of recovery.
And yet the Institute for Supply Management figures for the service sector -- in which companies are asked about whether new business is growing or shrinking -- have been very strong, showing consistent expansion since 2009.
The news release from the Bureau of Economic Analysis reports:
The annual revision of the national income and product accounts (NIPAs), covering the first quarter of 2009 through the first quarter of 2012, will be released along with the "advance" estimate of G.D.P. for the second quarter of 2012 on July 27, 2012. The August Survey of Current Business will contain an article that describes the annual revision in detail. 
When that comes out, I'll be looking to see if the service numbers are substantially revised.

HEADLINE: Big Ticket | Sold for $19,397,662.50

BYLINE: VIVIAN S. TOY


HIGHLIGHT: A full-floor penthouse apartment in a building designed by Jean Nouvel has a 4,500-square-foot terrace with panoramic views of Manhattan. 

 BODY:
A full-floor penthouse at 100 11th Avenue that sold for $19,397,662.50 was the biggest sale of the week, according to city records. The penthouse, which has a 4,500-square-foot terrace, was also the last sponsor unit to sell in the building, which was designed by Jean Nouvel.
Holly Parker, a managing director at Prudential Douglas Elliman who oversaw sales at 100 11th Avenue, on the Hudson River, said the actual sale price for the apartment was $19.75 million. She did not know why city records showed a lower number.
A 4,675-square-foot four-bedroom on the 23rd floor, the apartment had an asking price of $22 million, and it sparked a three-way bidding war. Ms. Parker said interested parties included a Nigerian buyer who offered well above $20 million. But after several weeks of uncertainty, in which the Nigerian repeatedly promised but failed to wire money for a deposit, the developer moved on to the second-highest bidder, who bought the apartment through a limited liability company. Ms. Parker declined to name the buyer, but said he was not foreign, as the other two bidders were. 
In addition to generating the highly charged bidding war, the apartment recently received screen time on the Bravo program "Million Dollar Listing New York." Ms. Parker, who appeared briefly on the show, confided that it was a little more fiction than fact.
In the episode, in which a party was held in the apartment for brokers and clients, Ms. Parker said, she already had contracts out on the apartment. "They just pretended for the show," she said. "It was all make-believe."
The building first came to market in 2007, but as with many new developments, sales lagged when the financial crisis hit, and several buyers walked away from hefty deposits when they could not close their deals. In fact, the 23rd-floor penthouse went into contract in 2009, but the buyer backed out and lost a $4.5 million deposit.
The listing describes this apartment as "the jewel in the crown that is Jean Nouvel's iconic masterpiece." It has 14-foot-high ceilings, two fireplaces, floor-to-ceiling windows and an enclosed loggia in addition to the roof terrace. With so few high-rise buildings in the area, Ms. Parker said, "you get 360-degree views of Manhattan and the water that are really unbelievably spectacular."
Big Ticket includes closed sales from the previous week, ending Wednesday.

HEADLINE: Tardec FED Bravo: A Deeper Shade of Army Green

BYLINE: AZADEH ENSHA


HIGHLIGHT: The Army claimed that the diesel hybrid concept, which had its debut in Detroit this week, burned fuel twice as efficiently as the Humvee. 

 BODY:
By its own admission, the Army tends not to fret over the fuel efficiency of its terrestrial vehicle fleet. But at the Society of Automotive Engineers World Congress in Detroit this week, the armed forces played against type, unveiling a new concept vehicle, the FED Bravo.
With a curb weight of 16,760 pounds, the FED Bravo, or Fuel Efficient ground vehicle Demonstrator, is a diesel hybrid said by the Army to achieve 8.2 miles per gallon in the city and 14.2 m.p.g. on the highway. The front axle is assisted by an electric motor, and a twin-turbodiesel 4.4-liter Ford V-8 engine, generating 268 horsepower, works with an electric motor to spin the rear wheels.
Financed by the secretary of defense and developed over four years, the hybrid was a collaboration between the Army's Tank Automotive Research, Development and Engineering Center, or Tardec, and students at the College for Creative Studies in Detroit.
"The focus has always been on survivability and the capabilities of the vehicle, but not fuel efficiency," Bruce J. Huffman, a Tardec spokesman, wrote in an e-mail. "However, since about 70 to 80 percent of the convoys in Afghanistan are hauling fuel, reducing our consumption and the number of fuel convoys will take thousands of soldiers out of harm's way. 'Less fuel, more fight' is the new mantra."
Though 8.2 m.p.g. may not seem mantra-worthy, the Army says the FED Bravo is intended to perform similar missions as the Humvee, which returns roughly half the fuel economy. The concept, which has a 24-gallon tank, can also travel five miles purely on electricity and features a stop-start feature to conserve fuel under idle.
The Army said it would continue to use research centers like Tardec to develop more fuel-efficient concept cars.
"The technology we are testing on the FED Bravo could potentially be integrated into future military ground vehicles," Mr. Huffman said. "Having the energy we need, when we need it, to accomplish the mission is vital, and even small cost savings can add up to a lot over time."

HEADLINE: The South, the War and 'Christian Slavery'

BYLINE: THOM BASSETT


HIGHLIGHT: Confederates believed that Civil War losses were divine punishment for mistreating slaves - but not for owning them. 

 BODY:
In the minds of many Southerners, the capture of New Orleans on April 25, 1862, by Union forces was more than simply a troubling military loss. It also raised the disturbing possibility that divine punishment was being inflicted on a spiritually wayward and sinful Confederacy. 
The loss of the South's most important port and largest city had followed on the heels of the loss of Tennessee's Fort Henry and Fort Donelson in February and the ignominious retreat from Shiloh in early April. These setbacks, after the virtually uninterrupted Southern successes of 1861, caused many across the Confederacy to wonder, in the words of the South Carolina diarist Pauline DeCaradeuc Heyward, if "these reversals and terrible humiliations ... come from Him to humble our hearts and remind us of our total helplessness without His aid."
Such thinking was in fact typical of mid-19th-century America. With varying degrees of sophistication and conviction, Americans believed that the fates of individuals and nations unfolded in accordance with an unshakeable divine plan; all events, large and small, reflected God's will and were expressions of his favor, testing or judgment. Of course, some, like the Confederate Edward Porter Alexander, would say of the conflict that "Providence did not care a pin about it." But most Northerners and Southerners struggled throughout the Civil War to discern the purposes and intentions of their God. 
While countless Union soldiers and northern civilians depended on theological narratives to sustain them, a providential view of history particularly influenced how Southerners reacted to and interpreted the events of the war. After all, the preamble to the Confederate constitution, unlike the federal one it replaced, explicitly invoked "the favor and guidance of Almighty God." They were, Southerners believed, a people chosen by God to manifest His will on earth. "We are working out a great thought of God," declared the South Carolina Episcopal theologian James Warley Miles, "namely the higher development of Humanity in its capacity for Constitutional Liberty." 
Miles held, though, that divine mandate extended beyond simply the Confederate interpretation of states' rights, and that Southerners were bound by the Bible to seek more than merely "a selfish independence." The Confederacy must "exhibit to the world that supremest effort of humanity" in creating and defending a society built upon obedience to biblical prescriptions regarding slavery, a society "sanctified by the divine spirit of Christianity." In short, as the Episcopal Church in Virginia stated soon after the war began, Southerners were fighting "a Revolution, ecclesiastical as well as civil." This would be a revolution that aimed to establish nothing less than, in the words of one Georgia woman, "the final and universal spread of Gospel civilization."
This "Gospel civilization," many believed, didn't just permit slavery - it required it. Christians across the Confederacy were convinced that they were called not only to perpetuate slavery but also to "perfect" it. And they understood the Bible to provide clear moral guidelines on how to properly practice it. The Old Testament patriarchs owned slaves, Jewish law clearly assumed its permissibility and the Apostle Paul's New Testament letters repeatedly compelled slaves to be obedient and loyal to their masters. Above all, as Southerners never tired of pointing out to their abolitionist foes, the Gospels fail to record any condemnation of the practice by Jesus Christ.
There is consequently a fascinating, if unsettling, paradox in the efforts of slaveholders to fulfill what they considered divinely imposed duties toward their slaves. Southern Christians believed that the Bible imposed on masters a host of obligations to their slaves. Most fundamentally, masters were to view slaves as fully members of their own households and as fellow brothers and sisters in the Lord. Therefore, as the South Carolina Methodist Conference declared before the war, masters sinned against their slaves by "excessive labor, extreme punishment, withholding necessary food and clothing, neglect in sickness or old age, and the like." 
Moreover, masters were not to let economic considerations govern treatment of their slaves. Religious leaders implored slaveholders to acknowledge that marriage and the family were divinely ordained and that, as a result, they must not separate husbands from wives or parents from children, even when it was financially advantageous to do so. (Almost no legislative action, however, resulted from these pleas; only the force of conscience would determine whether these biblical prescriptions were honored.) Many Southern Protestants advocated the repeal of laws banning slave literacy, so that slaves could read the Bible as a means to securing their eternal salvation. Before the war these practices were primarily justified as biblical mandates. Not coincidentally, though, they were also held out as a means to secure happier, more productive slaves, and to defang religious objections to the practice of slavery itself. 
But beginning in the spring of 1862 and continuing even past the end of the war, the theological significance of "Christian slavery" changed. Southern pastors and theologians combined a providential view of history with their understanding of what was biblically required of slaveholders to conclude that widespread failure to engage in "Christian slavery" was a main cause of divine favor's being withdrawn from God's own chosen people. In other words, they blamed the fall of New Orleans on the excesses of slave owners - though never on slavery itself. 
To be sure, these were not the only sins thought to bring down retribution on the Confederacy. "Blasphemy, Sabbath-breaking, selfishness," the Lutheran Church of South Carolina warned, also brought God's punishment in the form of battlefield setbacks, along with "avarice, hardness of heart, unbelief, and many other evils." This was of course a well-thumbed catalog of sins preachers in both the North and the South had railed against for decades. But as the fighting wore on and Confederate fortunes darkened, Southerners grew increasingly afraid it was their treatment of slaves that caused God to turn against them. 
For example, even while he was convinced God ultimately would vindicate the Confederacy, the influential Baptist minister Isaac Taylor Tichenor spoke for many Southerners when he addressed the Alabama General Assembly in 1863. "We have failed to discharge our duties to our slaves," he charged. "Marriage is a divine institution, and yet marriage exists among our slaves dependent upon the will of the master," leaving God's command perversely "subject to the passion, avarice, or caprice of their owners." 
Similarly, the theologian and college president John Leadley Dagg saw Confederate setbacks as "fatherly chastisements, designed for our profit." Nevertheless, he was insistent during the war that the failure to protect slave marriages "is only part of the general evil. We have not labored, in every possible way, to promote the welfare, for time and eternity of our slave population, as of dependent and helpless immortals whom God has placed in our power and in our mercy." In September 1862 Bishop Stephen Elliott warned Southerners that the "great revolution through which we are passing certainly turns upon the point of slavery, and our future destiny is bound up with it. As we deal with it, so shall we prosper or suffer."
A year after the war ended Dagg would insist that the Confederacy's defeat was due to white Southerners' failure to take proper care of their black charges. The war was "a scourge of God," according to Bishop John McGill of Richmond, Va., inflicted on the Confederacy for its failure to respect slave marriages and protect slave families.
Not all Southerners agreed. Some, like the South Carolinian Louis Blanding, simply dismissed all efforts to explain God's purposes in allowing the destruction of the South as "vague scholastic playthings, fit for the keen of edge discussion and of no earthly account." Others, like the Tennessee diarist Eliza Fain, were mystified why God would permit the end of slavery when the Bible so clearly justifies it; still, she concluded, "we cannot know now, but he does and this is all we deserve to know." 
Many Southerners, though, came to embrace the interpretation of their history suggested by Elliott and made explicit by the Reverend J.C. Mitchell. "Read the annals of other nations," the Alabaman admonished, "and see what destroyed them. It was not foreign force, but internal evil." After the war, then, for countless chastened white Southern Christians, the evil that provoked the Lord to destroy their nation was the myriad wrongs committed against the slaves they had kept. Vanishingly few asked whether their true sin might be claiming to own those whom the Bible called their brothers and sisters in Christ.

"Blasphemy, Sabbath-breaking, selfishness," the Lutheran Church of South Carolina warned, also brought God's punishment in the form of battlefield setbacks, along with "avarice, hardness of heart, unbelief, and many other evils." This was of course a well-thumbed catalog of sins preachers in both the North and the South had railed against for decades. But as the fighting wore on and Confederate fortunes darkened, Southerners grew increasingly afraid it was their treatment of slaves that caused God to turn against them. 
For example, even while he was convinced God ultimately would vindicate the Confederacy, the influential Baptist minister Isaac Taylor Tichenor spoke for many Southerners when he addressed the Alabama General Assembly in 1863. "We have failed to discharge our duties to our slaves," he charged. "Marriage is a divine institution, and yet marriage exists among our slaves dependent upon the will of the master," leaving God's command perversely "subject to the passion, avarice, or caprice of their owners." 
Similarly, the theologian and college president John Leadley Dagg saw Confederate setbacks as "fatherly chastisements, designed for our profit." Nevertheless, he was insistent during the war that the failure to protect slave marriages "is only part of the general evil. We have not labored, in every possible way, to promote the welfare, for time and eternity of our slave population, as of dependent and helpless immortals whom God has placed in our power and in our mercy." In September 1862 Bishop Stephen Elliott warned Southerners that the "great revolution through which we are passing certainly turns upon the point of slavery, and our future destiny is bound up with it. As we deal with it, so shall we prosper or suffer."
A year after the war ended Dagg would insist that the Confederacy's defeat was due to white Southerners' failure to take proper care of their black charges. The war was "a scourge of God," according to Bishop John McGill of Richmond, Va., inflicted on the Confederacy for its failure to respect slave marriages and protect slave families.
Not all Southerners agreed. Some, like the South Carolinian Louis Blanding, simply dismissed all efforts to explain God's purposes in allowing the destruction of the South as "vague scholastic playthings, fit for the keen of edge discussion and of no earthly account." Others, like the Tennessee diarist Eliza Fain, were mystified why God would permit the end of slavery when the Bible so clearly justifies it; still, she concluded, "we cannot know now, but he does and this is all we deserve to know." 
Many Southerners, though, came to embrace the interpretation of their history suggested by Elliott and made explicit by the Reverend J.C. Mitchell. "Read the annals of other nations," the Alabaman admonished, "and see what destroyed them. It was not foreign force, but internal evil." After the war, then, for countless chastened white Southern Christians, the evil that provoked the Lord to destroy their nation was the myriad wrongs committed against the slaves they had kept. Vanishingly few asked whether their true sin might be claiming to own those whom the Bible called their brothers and sisters in Christ.

HEADLINE: Growing Up Lost in Appalachia

BYLINE: JAMES ESTRIN


HIGHLIGHT: The photographer Ian Bates examines the perils of his generation - being left behind as the economy flails and technologies upend order. 

 BODY:
Update | May 10
Ian Bates is photographing a group of Appalachian teenagers coping with a tough economy. The project, "Growing Up Lost in Appalachia," is now the first installment of an exploration of his generation's experiences growing up amid high unemployment and breathtaking technological change.
But it didn't start out that way.
It began with a blast - from a carrot cannon.
In October 2011, Mr. Bates, a 20-year-old sophomore at Ohio University, was driving around looking for something interesting to shoot. He was passing through New Straitsville, a former coal mining town in southeastern Ohio, when he came across a scene that made him stop.
"I saw this house that had tons of old stuff in the yard and a big old oil rig truck, and these two young men were making a carrot cannon in the front yard," he said.
To the uninitiated, a carrot cannon involves taking a pressurized air tank, attaching a hose and a release lever, and inserting carrot pieces and blasting them across the yard. This was how J.R. Harrison and Cameron Blosser were occupied when Mr. Bates happened by.
He walked over and asked if he could take some pictures. This was his entree into a small group of teenagers and young adults tied together by friendship, frequent unemployment and a general feeling of hopelessness.
Mr. Bates grew to enjoy spending time with them. They would help out their neighbors if they needed wood chopped or yardwork done, and they would find creative ways to entertain themselves, like shooting flaming arrows or attaching skateboards to lounge chairs and going down hills. Because they couldn't afford a car, they rode their bicycles everywhere.
"There's nothing much to do but go hang out with your friends and drink," Mr. Bates said. "It's not how they want to live, but unless you can pay to go to college, the only jobs available are Walmart or McDonald's, and you can't really make a living there."
Before Mr. Bates started, one member of the group shot himself after several minor brushes with the law.
Though he is of the same generation as his subjects, Mr. Bates had an upbringing that was quite different. He grew up in a middle-class suburban New Jersey town with two parents who were always present. His father Todd Bates is a reporter for The Asbury Park Press. His mother Andrea is a kindergarten teacher.
When a high school photography teacher showed his class Matt Eich's "Love in the First Person" photographs, Mr. Bates was mesmerized. He e-mailed Mr. Eich, immediately asking what a photojournalist did and where he had gone to school. Mr. Eich had attended Ohio University, so Mr. Bates applied and was accepted. Mr. Eich, a member of Luceo Images, a photo collective, is coaching Mr. Bates on these Appalachian youth photos and will have him as an intern this summer in Norfolk, Va.
While Mr. Bates learns the basics in school, he is making powerful photos of these aimless young people. Though he is about the same age as his subjects, his focus is clear: to make intimate photo essays that speak of his generation's uncertain place in a rapidly changing world.
"I come to Ohio and drive 10 minutes outside of town and see people in run-down houses living on whatever they can get to survive," he said. "The kids help out the parents, but many of them are single parents who are working all the time, struggling to get by, and there isn't much structure in the family."
UPDATE: In response to numerous comments, Mr. Bates has emphasized that this is an ongoing project that will encompass other dimensions of life in the area. 
"My intention with creating this collection of images was to provide the outside world with some insight into the ways in which a group of friends grow up together in an area that is geologically more separated then most places in our country," Mr. Bates wrote in reply to one reader. "This chapter of images is the first installment of a larger body of work that will touch on geologically, demographically and financially different groups of young adults in many areas of our country and how they grow up."
CORRECTION: This post has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this post included an incorrect description of the young people depicted in the project. While they are indeed grappling with a tough economy and an uncertain future, it is not the case that they are all "poor" or "aimless."

HEADLINE: Obama Will Need Young Voters to Keep His Job, Even if They Don't Have One

BYLINE: FRANKIE EDOZIEN


HIGHLIGHT: The kids are revolting. And their displeasure over education costs and job prospects are shaking up politics from France to Canada to Chile to the United States. 

 BODY:
NEW YORK - If he's to have any hope of keeping his job, President Barack Obama needs to regain the love of young voters. But with 50 percent of Americans under 30 jobless or underemployed, the once cozy relationship is strained.
So Mr. Obama has kicked off his now re-election campaign by wooing university students with a charm offensive that began with an appearance on a late-night television show popular with young people, "Late Night With Jimmy Fallon."
For those not used to U.S.-style presidential campaigns, the appearance of a head of state on a late-night comedy show might seem a little odd - and Mr. Obama's Republican critics pounced. But young people are a critical voting bloc and while the group favors Mr. Obama over the certain Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, Mr. Obama needs to win them by a large margin given Republicans' advantage among older voters, white voters and male voters. 
The night that Mr. Romney was celebrating winning Republican primaries in five states and making the case that his campaign is one of hope for a better America, the president was pressing for a freeze on the interest rate charged on government student loans by trading lines with comedian Jimmy Fallon.
The Roots, an R&B band jammed, as the young audience squealed. 
For the president, the issue could be a winning one as American college debt is expected to hit $1 trillion, more than credit card debt. This motivated angry students to demonstrate in New York on Wednesday. 
Students around the world have flexed their collective muscle when pushed and political leaders have taken note. In 2010, thousands of British university students violently took to the streets when plans to increase tuition where announced. The protests continued last year. 
Chilean student protests last year forced reforms then students took to the streets this week to protest the reforms not going far enough. And this week protests by French-Canadian students over proposed tuition hikes turned violent in Montreal. The student movement, which has led a student strike for the last 11 weeks, could trigger a snap election in Quebec.
Presidential candidates going on TV to court young voters isn't new. But once elected part of being the commander-in-chief requires projecting an aura of strength. 
So comedic turns on television, even for serious matters, could be seen as a gamble. (The other gamble was the comedy: Student loans? Funny?) 
Though Mr. Obama's appearance was a hit among its intended audience, selling himself going forward is not likely to be as easy as it was four years ago. 
A recent poll by Harvard University's Institute of Politics found that only 20 percent of people between the ages of 18 and 29 believe the country is headed in the right direction. 
Four years ago, Mr. Obama fired up the enthusiasm in young voters. That enthusiasm is waning with the Harvard poll suggesting that only 43 percent would vote for him now. 
As a lawmaker he didn't show up to vote on the student loan bill he's now pushing Republican lawmakers in Congress to extend. Still his "jam session" only buttressed his cool factor to segments of America's youth who already know that he can sing. 
At least he isn't channeling rap stars Jay-Z and Kanye West the way French presidential aspirant, Franois Hollande, did to ratchet up his hip quotient. Maybe it worked, since Jean-Luc Mlenchon, the far-left leader and a youth favorite did less well than expected in Sunday's first round of elections.
Next week the Obama campaign will hold its first official re-election rallies with campus stops in Virginia and Ohio. Mr. Obama and his wife will reiterate that they only recently paid off their own student loans. 
"I didn't just get a policy briefing on this. Michelle and I, we've been in your shoes," the president has told students. 
Still Mr. Romney isn't ceding the youth vote. 
He asked: "When you look at 50 percent of kids coming out college today can't find a job or can't find a job which is consistent with their skills, how in the world can you be supporting a president that has led to that kind of economy?" The businessman however did an about face and now supports the student loan proposal after seeming to not agree. 
The president's pressing the issue appeared to work. Republican leaders announced they would vote for the interest rate freeze on Friday. It remains to be seen if it will be enough to push job seekers to the polls this fall.

HEADLINE: Ministers Wrap Up Clean Energy Meeting

BYLINE: JOHN M. BRODER


HIGHLIGHT: Ministers meeting in London agreed to share technology on energy-efficient appliances, map the potential for solar and wind energy and bring modern lighting to two million people in India by the end of 2015. 

 BODY:
Their work is not sexy and generates little controversy or media coverage, but a group of energy and environment ministers from 22 countries and the European Union is claiming substantial progress in spreading energy efficiency and more affordable energy around the globe.
 The third session of the so-called Clean Energy Ministerial concluded on Thursday in London with agreements to share technology on energy-efficient appliances, to map the potential for solar and wind energy, to finance a competition to develop low-energy flat-screen televisions and to bring modern lighting to two million people in India by the end of 2015. 
 The projects are relatively small in scale but their achievements can be measured on the ground. In that, the group stands in sharp contrast to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, which includes more than 190 countries and is dedicated to addressing global warming on a planetary scale. The United Nations body, which has been meeting for 20 years, has set ambitious goals for reducing global emissions of climate-altering gasses but has so far failed to produce a workable international agreement to achieve them.
 The ministerial group, which is coordinating its efforts with the Sustainable Energy for All initiative of the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, has shorter-term goals, including eliminating the need to build 650 power plants, accelerating the spread of clean energy technology and providing energy access to more than 10 million people who today lack electricity. The nations in the ministerial group, which include the United States, Russia, China and India, produce roughly 80 percent of the world's greenhouse gases.

 Steven Chu, the secretary of energy, represented the United States at the two-day meeting. "By working together, we can seize the clean energy opportunity - saving money for consumers, promoting sustainable economic growth and protecting the planet for future generations," he said of the participants.
 India will be the host of next year's session.

HEADLINE: Obama vs. Romney: Battle of the Fairness Doctrines

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: For months, President Obama has been making his case for greater economic fairness. But now it is clear Mitt Romney is not about to cede the fairness issue. 

 BODY:
For months, President Obama has been making the case for what he calls the "American values of fair play" and accusing Republicans of pushing policies that unfairly benefit the rich over the middle class.
The message is at the core of the campaign Mr. Obama's aides want to run against Mitt Romney, a man who they believe personifies the advantages wealthy people enjoy in an economy that has struggled for years to recover.
But now it's clear that Mr. Romney is not about to cede fairness to his rival. 
In a new argument that he first offered in a primary victory speech on Tuesday, Mr. Romney is laying claim to his own version of the fairness issue. He argues that the policies pursued by Mr. Obama and his Democratic allies are fundamentally unfair to Americans.
"I see an America with a growing middle class, with rising standards of living," he said, speaking in New Hampshire. "This America is fundamentally fair."
"And as I look around at the millions of Americans without work, the graduates who can't get a job, the soldiers who return home to an unemployment line, it breaks my heart," Mr. Romney added. "This does not have to be. It's the result of failed leadership and a faulty vision." 
Call it the clash of the fairness doctrines.
Mr. Obama and his advisers are betting on the frustration that many Americans feel when they see the growing gap between the economic successes of the wealthy and the continuing struggles of the middle class. And they scoff at the idea that Mr. Romney might lay claim to a fairness argument.
"I have a high regard for the American people," said David Axelrod, a senior strategist for Mr. Obama. "I don't think that they are going to be ultimately taken in by rhetoric that completely contradicts the reality of who he is and what his program would do."
In an interview with The Caucus, Mr. Axelrod said that Mr. Romney argues for a trickle-down economic policy that directly benefits the wealthy. He quipped that Mr. Romney's embrace of fairness reminded him of a line by George Burns: "All you need to succeed in show business is sincerity, and if you can fake that, you got it made."
"He can moralize about those things," Mr. Axelrod said of Mr. Romney. "But his records don't match."
Mr. Obama and his Democratic allies have spent much of the last several months trying to highlight the fairness issue. The president spoke about it in his State of the Union address in January. And Congress has debated Mr. Obama's "Buffet Rule," which the president casts as a measure to address fairness in the tax code.
"When Americans talk about folks like me paying my fair share of taxes, it's not because they envy the rich," Mr. Obama said to the joint session of Congress. "It's because they understand that when I get a tax break I don't need and the country can't afford, it either adds to the deficit, or somebody else has to make up the difference."
But Mr. Romney, in his New Hampshire speech, made it clear he is unwilling to let his rival own that issue. And his words suggested that he wants to redefine how the American public looks at the question of fairness.
Mr. Romney assailed what he called the "unfairness" of a lack of school choice, contribution requirements for union workers, higher benefits for government workers and growing federal debt that will burden future generations.
"We will stop the unfairness of government workers getting better pay and benefits than the very taxpayers they serve," he said to loud applause. "And -- and we will stop the unfairness of one generation passing larger and larger debts onto the next."
Stuart Stevens, a senior adviser to Mr. Romney, declined to discuss the specific thinking about the campaign's embrace of fairness as a new theme in Mr. Romney's speeches.
But he hinted that the new language would help Mr. Romney frame the next six months as a referendum on Mr. Obama's record in office and the impact on people's lives.
"This is the beginning of an ongoing conversation where people are going to have to ask themselves do they believe that President Obama has accomplished what he set out to accomplish," Mr. Stevens said. "Do they think their lives have improved?"
Mr. Stevens said that efforts to dissect Mr. Romney's speech in New Hampshire was "green room chatter" that would not matter in the end.
"Someone who just got a promotion, got a new house, got a new car, and is able to tell their kid that they can go to college - that person is someone that believes that life is going in a positive direction," Mr. Stevens said. "Unfortunately, there are a lot fewer of those people because of Barack Obama's policies and his failure."
Neither campaign seems willing to give an inch on the question of which candidate would better address the sense of unfairness among the middle class. 
That suggests that the debate will intensify during the next six months as Mr. Romney and Mr. Obama both fight over how to define fairness in the context of the country's economic crisis.
Whichever candidate wins that rhetorical battle may have the upper hand in convincing voters to turn out for him.

HEADLINE: European Fiscal Crisis Could Shape Debate Over U.S. Economy

BYLINE: RICHARD W. STEVENSON


HIGHLIGHT: As distant as it might appear to voters in the United States, the British economic situation has a direct bearing on the central debate in the presidential campaign. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney effectively wrapped up the Republican presidential nomination. Newt Gingrich said he would drop out. President Obama stumped through key swing states. But there's a case to be made that the developments this week with the greatest long-term meaning for American politics took place across the Atlantic, not in Washington or New Hampshire or Iowa. 
 In Britain, the economy lapsed into a double-dip recession, a result in part of a strict fiscal austerity plan imposed by the conservative government. And political tremors swept across the Continent as the European Union engaged in a fierce battle over whether Germany is demanding excessively deep budget cuts in the effort to keep debtor countries from financial collapse.
At a minimum, Europe's woes could create another headwind for the United States economy. More broadly, events there, as distant as they might appear to voters here, have a direct bearing on the central debate in the presidential campaign, over the size and role of government and the degree and timing of deficit reduction necessary to forestall a long-term fiscal crisis.
 But whichever side of the ocean you are on, few topics are more ideologically divisive than fiscal policy, so it's no surprise that left and right are drawing very different conclusions from what is happening. 
 From one perspective, the European experience provides yet more evidence that trying to slash budget deficits too aggressively can backfire in a big way when economies in most nations remain fragile. 
 Britain's austerity experiment in particular has been judged by economists to have been ill-timed and poorly constructed at best. It is a reminder, in the consensus view, that the basic tenets of Keynesian economics - primarily, that government spending plays a key role in maintaining demand when the private sector is struggling in a severe financial crisis -- remain as valid as ever. 
 In the United States, the British experience is being held up, by Democrats and mainstream economists, as an object lesson in the risks inherent in aggressive short-term budget-cutting amid signs that the recovery could be losing traction again.
 However flawed the stimulus plan Mr. Obama pushed through Congress more than three years ago, fiscal policy has helped the United States generate stronger growth rates coming out of the recession than Britain or the euro zone countries.
 "The U.K. made a stupid mistake," said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics. "Theoretically, the U.S. is in a less-bad situation than the U.K. to deal with fiscal tightening - but less-bad does not mean good."
 From another perspective, the European upheaval is a warning that cleaning up the mess from chronic over-borrowing is a long and deeply painful process, both economically and politically, and that the best option is to clamp down on government profligacy before it gets out of hand.
 To many Republicans, Europe today represents what will happen to the United States if it does not act now to rein in spending, cut taxes and free businesses from many of the costs of regulation.
 "What we're seeing here is what happens when politicians make so many empty promises to their citizens, and then they turn into broken promises when they can't keep spending other people's money," said Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee.
Mr. Ryan's recent budget proposal embodies the conservative view that shrinking government in an immediate and substantial way will clear the way for more robust private sector growth and remove the threat of the United States being brought down by a mountain of debt.
 "We're trying to pre-empt austerity," Mr. Ryan told Jonathan Weisman of The Times on Thursday. "We want to prevent that bitter kind of European austerity mode which is what we will have if we have a debt crisis: austerity round after austerity round after austerity round, cutting benefits to current seniors, cutting people in the safety net, raising taxes, slowing down your economy, making it harder for youth to get employed and get careers. That's what you do after a debt crisis hits."
 The problems facing Greece and the other most deeply troubled European economies are different from what is facing the United States in many ways, including scale. The United States, unlike, Europe, faces little immediate pressure from financial markets and has the ability to operate its fiscal and monetary policy in tandem, while European governments gave up direct national control of monetary policy when they agreed to adopt a common currency.
 But the comparisons to Britain, which stayed out of the currency union and now has a government very much in synch philosophically with the Republican Party in Washington, are far more direct in both political and economic terms.
 Mr. Ryan's plan proposes roughly the same scale of deficit reduction as is being sought by the British government. The British budget calls from reducing that nation's deficit from a current level of 8.3 percent of gross domestic product to 1.1 percent in five years, while the Ryan plan would bring the deficit in the United States from 7.6 percent of G.D.P. to 0.9 percent over the same period purely through spending cuts. 
Mr. Obama's budget proposal, which cuts spending more gradually than the Ryan plan, has a goal of reducing the deficit to 2.5 percent of G.D.P. in five years.
 To Democrats and economists outside the partisan wars, the results in Britain leave little room for argument. Austerity in the short run, they say, does not strengthen economies still recovering from severe credit crunches of the sort that sent the United States into its deepest downturn since the Great Depression.
 Conservatives, in a familiar echo of a long-running domestic argument, say the problem with the austerity plan put in place by Prime Minister David Cameron's coalition government in Britain is not that it was ill-timed or too aggressive, but that it relied too heavily on tax increases. 
 About a third of its deficit reduction comes from higher revenues. Mr. Ryan's plan contains no tax increases, and Mr. Obama calls for tax increases to make up about a third of his deficit reduction plan.
 "The problem with the British consolidation was too much tax increase," said Kevin A. Hassett, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who co-authored a study
 concluding that successful fiscal tightening plans tend to be those that rely on spending cuts for at least 80 percent of deficit reduction. 
 If there is any shared lesson from Europe, it is that the United States cannot afford to let the clashes over budget cutting in the short term keep it from finding some consensus on how to begin addressing the mounting long-term costs of supporting an aging population. At some point, the two parties will have to reach some kind of compromise to fix the imbalances looming in the decades ahead - something Mr. Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner came tantalizingly close to achieving last year.
 "It's not an issue of whether the U.S. has to go through a fiscal consolidation," said Domenico Lombardi, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and president of the Oxford Institute for Economic Policy. "It's a matter of devising an appropriate pace at which the U.S. can credibly and sustainably consolidate."

HIGHLIGHT: The defense of Rajat K. Gupta got a boost from the disclosure of an insider inquiry targeting a Goldman banker in California. In China, big banks are starved for capital after a lending spree. And Andrew Ross Sorkin finds "tainted" executives sheltered on boards. A look back on our reporting of the past week's highs and lows in finance. 

 BODY:
 The defense of Rajat K. Gupta got a boost from the disclosure of an insider inquiry targeting a Goldman banker in California. In China, big banks are starved for capital after a lending spree. And Andrew Ross Sorkin finds "tainted" executives sheltered on boards. 
A look back on our reporting of the past week's highs and lows in finance.
Mergers & Acquisitions
NESTLE TO BUY PFIZER UNIT FOR $11.9 BILLION The Swiss food giant made its largest ever acquisition as it expands its global presence in the baby food market, Michael J. de la Merced reported. The deal will help Nestl tap into the growth of the emerging markets, like China and Saudi Arabia, and allow Pfizer to focus on developing new prescription drugs.
AMYLIN IS SAID TO BE LOOKING FOR A SUITOR The maker of diabetes drugs is working with Credit Suisse, Goldman Sachs and the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom after rebuffing an unsolicited $3.5 billion takeover offer from Bristol-Myers Squibb earlier this year, Mr. de la Merced reported.
Investment Banking
EUROPE'S DEBT WOES CRIMP BANK PROFITS The economic malaise depressed trading and investment banking activities at Deutsche Bank, and Banco Santander experienced a sharp rise in troubled loans, Mark Scott reported. Even Barclays of Britain, which bucked the trend, cautioned that Europe's economic woes could take a toll on future earnings.
CREDIT SUISSE CUTS COSTS, BUT SUFFERS A 96% PROFIT SLIDE "The big Swiss bank continued to contend with the dual headwinds of a new regulatory environment and an economic slump," Julia Werdigier reported. 
AFTER A LENDING BOOM, CHINA'S BIG BANKS ARE SQUEEZED FOR CAPITAL "Chinese firms have maintained that their profit growth is strong and their balance sheets are solid, raising red flags among some analysts about the banks' persistent capital needs," Neil Gough reported.
"For the first time, a large number of Chinese banks are beginning to face cash pressures," Charlene Chu, a banking analyst at Fitch Ratings, wrote in a research report. "It is because of this cash constraint that the forthcoming wave of asset quality issues has the potential to become uglier and more destabilizing than in previous episodes of loan portfolio deterioration."
I.P.O./Offerings
FACEBOOK'S PROFIT FALLS 12% AHEAD OF EXPECTED OFFERING The latest financial figures "may raise questions about whether Facebook will be able to command a high stock value when it goes public, a number built largely on the promise of continued growth," Mr. de la Merced reported. 
Legal/Regulatory
INSIDER INQUIRY FOCUSES ON GOLDMAN BANKER Federal prosecutors in California are said to be investigating whether Matthew E. Korenberg leaked confidential information about health care deals to the Galleon Group, Peter Lattman reported. The disclosures could aid in the defense of Rajat K. Gupta, a former Goldman board member facing charges that he leaked boardroom secrets about Goldman and Procter & Gamble.
AFTER QUIET YEARS, BRITISH REGULATOR GETS TOUGH ON ABUSES "Britain's securities regulator once had a reputation for taking a light-touch approach to regulation." No longer, reported Mr. Scott. "The regulator, the Financial Services Authority, is acting instead more and more like a heavy, conducting predawn raids and bringing a rising number of cases for insider trading and other market abuses."
CHASING FEES, BANKS COURT LOW EARNERS The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said it was examining whether banks ran afoul of consumer protection laws in marketing alternative products that can carry high fees, Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Ben Protess reported. 
"I may as well have gone to a payday lender," said David Wegner, a 36-year-old nursing assistant in Minneapolis.
DEWEY & LEBOEUF CRISIS MIRRORS THE LEGAL INDUSTRY'S WOES In an interview with Mr. Lattman, Michael H. Trotter, a partner at Taylor English Duma in Atlanta, discussed the Dewey case and the broader problems facing many of the country's largest law firms.
"There are now far more capable lawyers and law firms than there is work for them to do," Mr. Trotter said.
EX-MORGAN STANLEY OFFICIAL PLEADS GUILTY TO VIOLATING ANTICORRUPTION LAWS Garth R. Peterson was charged with secretly acquiring millions of dollars' worth of property investments for himself and a Chinese government official, Mr. Lattman reported, "as the American government continues to crack down on citizens who commit fraud and bribery abroad."
AN MF GLOBAL TRUSTEE DEFENDS HIS INQUIRY Louis J. Freeh, who has drawn heat for his handling of the case, "brushed away criticism at a Congressional hearing that he had prevented the brokerage firm's customers - hedge funds and farmers among them - from recovering their money," Mr. Protess and Azam Ahmed reported.
DEAL PROFESSOR: INVESTORS FACE FRAUD IN CHINA Steven M. Davidoff says that foreign investors in Chinese companies might have bought shares that don't really represent much.
The variable interest entity structure may be the root of the problem when foreign investors own shares in Chinese companies, but it is only part of it. The norms for business are different in China, and enforcing legal contracts or rights is sometimes impossible. Legal title to assets is often not formalized, and even when it is, Chinese executives can use the lack of rule of law to take advantage of foreign shareholders.
DEALBOOK COLUMN: 'TAINTED,' BUT SHELTERED ON BOARDS Andrew Ross Sorkin says that many executives who had tumultuous reigns are board members of major public companies.
"It always surprises us when we see these directors without any questions being asked," Paul Hodgson, senior research associate at GMI, a governance ratings firm, said generally of executives who oversaw failed companies or companies that were involved with scandals. "Shareholders are starting to wake up to this."
FORMER CHIEF OF CALPERS IS CHARGED WITH FRAUD The S.E.C. charged Federico R. Buenrostro with defrauding Apollo Global Management into paying $20 million to Alfred J. R. Villalobos, Mr. Lattman reported. It is "the latest case to raise questions about suspected conflicts of interest at state retirement funds."
EX-PREMIER OF ICELAND CONVICTED OF ONE CHARGE IN '08 CRISIS Geir H. Haarde "was the first politician to face a court over his actions - or, in this case, inactions - during the financial crisis as three of the nation's largest banks collapsed," Ms. Werdigier reported.
S.E.C. SUES SINOTECH OF CHINA The legal action against the oil field services company delisted by the Nasdaq in January "is the latest example of a continuing crackdown on accounting fraud and other financial crimes at Chinese companies listed in the United States," Mr. Gough reported.

HEADLINE: In Ohio, Romney Hails Two Entrepreneurs Named John

BYLINE: MICHAEL BARBARO


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney recounts two success stories - Jimmy John's and Papa John's -- to college students in Ohio. 

 BODY:
WESTERVILLE, Ohio - This is the story of two John's - Jimmy John's and Papa John's.
Both have made it big in the fast food world. Mitt Romney, it turns out, has met both of them. And he likes their stories.
Because their stories are a bit like his own (in some respects, anyway). They are entrepreneurs - and, usefully, they are emblems of the economic opportunity in America that Mr. Romney highlights in just about every campaign speech he delivers.
On Friday afternoon here, Mr. Romney recounted their tales during a guest lecture to students at Otterbein University, a private liberal arts college in suburban Ohio.
Mr. Romney started with Jimmy John, the founder of Jimmy John's Gourmet Sandwiches.
"He graduated from high school and he didn't want to go to college," Mr. Romney said. "And he said to his dad, can I borrow some money, I want to start a business."
His father was skeptical, but he loaned him $20,000. "The only thing that would work for $20,000 was a sandwich shop, so he started making sandwiches," Mr. Romney said.
The rest, Mr. Romney said, is more or less history. His outfit went national. "His sandwiches are doing pretty well," Mr. Romney said, chuckling.
Mr. Romney encouraged the students in the room to follow Mr. John's path. "Take, take a shot, go for it. Take a risk. Get the education. Borrow money if you have to from your parents. Start a business."
This led, naturally, to the second John. "The other night I was with, another restaurant guy, Papa John," Mr. Romney said. He did not say how the two had met, but given Mr. Romney's heavy schedule of fundraisers these days, there is a strong chance it was at one of them.
"I think he said it was in 1966 he opened his first pizza restaurant and today employs thousands of people," Mr. Romney said.
"We welcome that. We celebrate that in this country. It's one of the reasons we are the nation we are."

HEADLINE: John Thain, 'Grade A' Dad

BYLINE: KEVIN ROOSE


HIGHLIGHT: John Thain, along with three other high-profile fathers, is being honored at the 71st annual Father of the Year awards, which are organized by the Father's Day/Mother's Day Council. 

 BODY:
John A. Thain, the former chief executive of Merrill Lynch, did a less-than-ideal job parenting Merrill through its 2008 merger with Bank of America. (Remember the $35,000 "commode on legs?")
But Mr. Thain's actual parenting skills - to his two sons and two daughters - are apparently top notch.
Mr. Thain, along with three other prominent fathers, is being honored at the 71st annual Father of the Year awards, which are organized by the Father's Day/Mother's Day Council. Mr. Thain will be honored by the nonprofit group at a luncheon on June 14, along with other famous fathers like Oscar Feldenkreis, the president of Perry Ellis International; Reynold Levy, the president of the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts; and Shaquille O'Neal, the basketball legend and television commentator.
 Past honorees by the group have include the studio mogul Harvey Weinstein, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and the rapper LL Cool J.
Mr. Thain, who now runs the CIT Group, is a noted philanthropist whose charity projects have included a prenatal care center at a New York hospital and a forest in the Bronx. And he was recently interviewed for a PBS Frontline special about the roots of the financial crisis.
At the lunch, perhaps Mr. Thain and Mr. O'Neal can talk about recovering from high-profile mistakes. Mr. O'Neal, after all, starred in "Kazaam".

HEADLINE: Murdoch's Denials of Political Favors Hard to Swallow in New York

BYLINE: JENNIFER PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: News Corporation subsidiaries have asked for help -- and received it -- from several New York politicians, most notably from former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. 

 BODY:
Former Mayor Edward I. Koch said he was in his West Village apartment early one morning in 1977 when the phone rang and the man on the other end of the line said, "Good morning, Congressman. It's Rupert."
"I say to myself: 'Rupert? That's not a Jewish name. Who could be calling me named Rupert?' "
Then, Mr. Koch said, he recognized an Australian accent. It was Rupert Murdoch, the new owner of The New York Post.
" 'I don't know if it will help, but we are endorsing you on the front page of The New York Post,' " Mr. Koch recalls Mr. Murdoch telling him.
"I said, 'Rupert, you have just elected me.' "
Mr. Murdoch's relationships with British politicians from Margaret Thatcher to David Cameron were dissectedthis week during his two days of testimony before a judicial inquiry in London looking into the phone hacking scandal that has shaken the media mogul's $60 billion News Corporation. Throughout his testimony, Mr. Murdoch adamantly denied ever using his considerable political influence to win favor for his business interests.
So what about Mr. Murdoch's relationships with politicians here in New York City, where he bought The New York Post in 1976, founded the Fox News Channel in 1996 and purchased The Wall Street Journal in 2007?
Without question, Mr. Koch said in an interview on Thursday, Mr. Murdoch's decision to use The New York Post to throw its support behind his candidacy helped him defeat Mario Cuomo in the 1977 Democratic mayoral primary, the runoff and then in the general election.
"That made the difference between winning and losing, and I am very grateful," Mr. Koch said about the endorsement.
What did Rupert want in return? "He never, ever in the course of the 12 years that I was there asked me for a single thing, except one small thing," Mr. Koch recalled.
Mr. Koch said he remembered getting a request from a representative of The New York Post to temporarily lift the ban on trucks using the West Side and East Side Highways so The Post could get its newspapers out more quickly during a newspaper strike. "I said, sure," Mr. Koch said.
But things were different with Rudolph W. Giuliani's administration.
In 1989, Mr. Murdoch's New York Post endorsed Mr. Giuliani over David N. Dinkins, who became the city's first African-American mayor. Mr. Giuliani's media adviser, as it turns out, was Roger E. Ailes, who would go on to start and run Fox News.
In 1993, Mr. Giuliani defeated Mr. Dinkins's bid for a second term, becoming mayor in 1994. Two years later, Mr. Ailes was the founding chief executive officer of Fox News, a subsidiary of Mr. Murdoch's News Corporation.
Mr. Murdoch said in London that he did not use his political ties for his business interests, but he and his executives did turn to Mayor Giuliani for help after the Time Warner Cable New York City Group rejected their request for Fox News to have a channel, according to court records and news accounts at the time.
In an interview on Thursday, Richard Aurelio, then the president of Time Warner Cable New York City Group, said there were only 80 channels in the city when the Fox News 24-hour channel began in the fall of 1996 and wanted access to Time Warner's 1.1 million New York City cable customers.
Mr. Aurelio, a former deputy mayor for John Lindsay, said he told Fox News that he would not have a channel to give them until more channels became available when they went digital.
Fox News did not want to wait. My colleague Clifford Levyreported in 1996 that Mr. Ailes contacted Mr. Giuliani to try to persuade Time Warner to change its position.
Then, on Oct. 1, 1996, at a launch party for the new Fox News Channel, Mr. Murdoch himself expressed concern about the situation to some of New York's leading politicians who attended, including Mr. Giuliani, Gov. George E. Pataki and Dennis C. Vacco, the state attorney general.
"He complained to them at the party that I was the big bottleneck, and that I refused to carry Fox News," Mr. Aurelio said. "They tried to put pressure on me. I said, 'I can't help you right now.' "
Mr. Aurelio also got a call from Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato. "Both Pataki and D'Amato were pretty pleasant about it," he said. "They didn't twist any arms. They were unhappy. But, it seemed to me, in their case, they were doing it because they were asked to do it by Murdoch."
Mr. Aurelio said Mr. Giuliani and his staff took a different approach. "He summoned us down to City Hall, and had one of his advisers try to browbeat me."
Then, the Giuliani administration decided to help Fox News by turning over one of the city's five municipal channels, as Mr. Levy reported.
"This was illegal," Mr. Aurelio said. "We got an injunction and the court agreed."
To "Time Warner executives," Mr. Levy reported, "the contacts demonstrate that Mr. Murdoch, a prominent conservative who also owns The New York Post, wields excessive influence over the mayor."
Mr. Giuliani was unavailable to comment on Friday, according to an aide. A spokeswoman for Mr. Ailes did not immediately respond to a request to speak to him.
There are other examples of a cozy relationship between the News Corporation and the Giuliani administration, as the investigative reporter Wayne Barrettdescribedin The Daily Beast last year.
In 1996, Mr. Giuliani and his aides fiercely defended their conversations with the News Corporation. They emphasized that their interest was in protecting local jobs.
Protecting jobs prompts elected officials to do a lot on behalf of business owners, even when they don't benefit from Mr. Murdoch's media empire. Mr. Murdoch did not endorse former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo during the 1977 mayoral race and urged Mayor Koch to run for governor against him in the 1980s. But Mr. Cuomo recalled in an interview on Friday that he helped Mr. Murdoch on multiple occasions, including winning a waiver from the Federal Communications Commission so that Mr. Murdoch could run The New York Post.
"The paper beat me to a pulp, but my feeling was that 800 jobs or so were on the line," he said.
Finally, after Mr. Aurelio retired in July 1997, Mr. Murdoch got the channel for Fox News on Time Warner's cable system in New York City.
At the same time, another New York City media mogul got a channel on Time Warner for his cable programming. The Giuliani administration was looking to help him, as well.
That mogul's name was Michael R. Bloomberg.
What did Mr. Murdoch have to say about Mr. Bloomberg during his testimony in London this week?
In response to a question about the perception that he trades political support for favors, Mr. Murdoch cited Mr. Bloomberg as proof that was not the case.
"I think it's a myth," he said about political influence. "And everything I do every day, I think, proves it to be such. Have a look at -- well, it's not relevant, but how I treat Mayor Bloomberg in New York. Sends him crazy. But we support him every time he runs for re-election."
An earlier version of this article incorrectly identified Roger E. Ailes's role in Rudolph W. Giuliani's campaign in 1989. Mr. Ailes was his media adviser, not his campaign manager.

HEADLINE: Osama Bin Laden Joins the U.S. Presidential Race

BYLINE: FRANKIE EDOZIEN


HIGHLIGHT: An April with the candidates already decided might slip into the political doldrums. Not this year. Before the Republicans define the president, the Obama camp is trying to remind voters he has accomplished some big things. 

 BODY:
NEW YORK - By Monday morning, the newest skyscraper rising from the site of the September 11, 2001 attacks is expected to be the tallest building in New York's skyline.
The tower at One World Trade Center, at 1776 feet (541 meters) and 104 floors, will be 403 feet taller than the twin towers it is replacing. When finished in 2013 or 2014, it will be the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere. The tallest building in the world will remain Dubai's Burj Khalifa in the United Arab Emirates, at 2,717 feet or 828 meters.
Next week could be a moment of triumph for Americans who, one year ago, were celebrating in the streets of Lower Manhattan and Washington, D.C. when President Barack Obama announced that Osama bin Laden, the mastermind behind 9/11, had been killed. 
Back then the Democratic president refused to do a victory dance, saying Americans didn't "need to spike the football."
But that was a year ago.
Facing an onslaught of criticism from Republican rivals who try to paint him as a lightweight celebrity, the Obama White House and campaign are engaging in a media blitz meant to remind everyone who has been calling the shots on foreign policy.
Mr. Obama's aides enlisted former president Bill Clinton to narrate this web ad that suggests that Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, would not have pursued the Qaeda leader as aggressively. 
Mr. Clinton's involvement in this ad reminded many of the fierce primary contest four years ago when Hillary Rodham Clinton, now Mr. Obama's Secretary of State, questioned his foreign policy credentials in her own national security ad.
As Peter Baker and Michael D. Shear note in the Times, the president has actually been talking about Bin Laden for months - including in his State of the Union address. Only now the intensity has changed. 
Mr. Obama will be on national television on Wednesday, the anniversary of Bin Laden's death, doing part of the interview in The Situation Room. The president's aides have been interviewed for a Time Magazine special report, and there's much more.
Republicans have seized upon Mr. Obama's reluctance to score political points with the death of Bin Laden last year. His 2008 opponent, Senator John McCain of Arizona, called the new web ad "shameless" and "pathetic." 
"Barack Obama is not only trying to score political points by invoking Osama bin Laden, he is doing a shameless end-zone dance to help himself get re-elected," Mr. McCain said. Romney campaign spokespeople accused the president of trying to divide the country. 
Usually disciplined and on message, Mr. Obama rarely raised the issue, but when pushed he has reminded foes that he has tackled some big challenges.
No doubt the White House's attempt to capitalize on the anniversary of the Bin Laden death is meant to counter the Republican message that Mr. Obama has been an ineffectual and incompetent president who is out of his depth. 
Normally, an April with the presidential candidates already decided, might slip into the political doldrums for a while. Not this year. Before the Republicans define the president in their terms, the Obama camp is trying to make it clear that he did accomplish some big things, despite the enduring economic malaise and the health care overhaul that is far less popular than they had expected. 
Vice President Joseph Biden Jr. gave a speech saying that the re-election slogan would be "Bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive," referring to the car-company bailout orchestrated by the administration.
Mr. Obama's opening salvo of his re-election campaign should not have caught Republicans by surprise. On Thursday night, Mr. Biden told an audience at New York University that Mr. Romney and the Republicans had ideas that were from another era.
His boss, he said, talked softly but carried a big stick. "I promise you, the president has a big stick. I promise you."
Of course, the danger of trumpeting foreign successes is that between now and the election in November there are any number of foreign challenges that could explode.

HEADLINE: A Ballpark That May Be Louder Than the Fans

BYLINE: By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN

 BODY:
MIAMI -- After 20 years of retro-style ballparks since the opening of Oriole Park at Camden Yards in Baltimore, nearly all decked out with brick facades and calculated quirks that came to seem as predictable and interchangeable as the old doughnut-shaped arenas, Major League Baseball has its first unapologetic 21st-century stadium.
Lumbering and dizzyingly white in the Florida sun, the new Marlins Park is an elliptical concrete, steel and glass boulder looming above the low-rise houses and empty lots of the Little Havana neighborhood. With retail on the outside and a public plaza in front, it's designed partly to gin up some street life. Economic development is supposed to follow -- that was the rationale for the public financing that covered most of the $634 million project ($515 million for the park itself) and contributed to the recall of Miami-Dade County's mayor. Cities are always building new stadiums with the justification that they'll catalyze the local economy. They rarely do. 
At the same time, the ballpark is unlikely to satisfy aficionados of the latest trends in architecture, but it is nonetheless a modern building, with genuine panache, as opposed to another pastiche. Give the team's owner, Jeffrey Loria, credit. An art dealer, he cares more than most about aesthetics and took a gamble -- part old-school civic improvement plan, part marketing strategy -- that Miamians will recognize themselves in the stylishness of the place.
He has festooned concourses and stairwells with art, photographs and sculpture. Most fans will no doubt focus more on the grass field, air-conditioning and retractable roof, which slides over the entry plaza onto slender, palm-shaped pillars, illuminated by pulsing lights. Because of the oppressive heat and rain, the roof isn't likely to be opened for more than a dozen or so games a year, but even when it is closed, there are sweeping views of the city skyline through 60-foot-tall windows.
The challenge now will be filling the park's seats. With a capacity of 37,442, this is one of the smallest arenas in the big leagues, but Miamians have notoriously stayed away from Marlins games in droves. Mr. Loria and the city are banking, as so many other owners and cities have, that a new stadium can change a team's and a neighborhood's fortunes.
Can it? The Miami Marlins, until this year the Florida Marlins, have labored since their inaugural season in 1993 in a 75,000-seat suburban football arena, where the Dolphins play, which can be as much as an hour's drive from downtown, with lousy sightlines, crippling summertime humidity and no roof. The Miami Herald's Marlins beat reporter, Clark Spencer, told me on a recent night that he used to pass the time with colleagues in the press booth counting attendance.
''Once we counted 80-something people,'' he said, ''and that included some confused foreign tourists.''
Mr. Loria, who took over in 2002, argued that it was pointless to spend money on top players without a domed stadium. Detractors said he was blackmailing the city into paying for a new park, meanwhile pocketing revenue-sharing millions from other teams that were meant to go toward a beefier payroll.
But then in 2007, Miami officials consented to a new stadium on the site of the former Orange Bowl, a couple of miles from downtown. The city provided the land and $13 million. Miami-Dade County paid nearly $350 million for the bulk of construction, with the Marlins kicking in $161.2 million. The pliant architecture firm Populous, formerly HOK Sport, which designed Yankee Stadium and nearly every retro ballpark during the last two decades, was hired to do the architecture.
Orel Hershiser, the pitcher turned ESPN analyst, got in first dibs as critic on opening night when, apropos the swooping ''Star Trek'' curves on the outside, he said that the stadium looked ''like a cruise ship had a baby with a spaceship.''
Almost endearingly, when we met, Mr. Loria countered with a few wishful comparisons to the Getty Center in Los Angeles and Frank Lloyd Wright's Guggenheim Museum. He said the inspiration for the stadium's electric color scheme, with its fluorescent-green outfield wall, was the palette of the Spanish painter Joan Miro. Public art and native plantings are meant to lend his building's exterior what might be called an aspirational gravitas.
Inside Mr. Loria has also installed giant reproductions of paintings by blue-chip modernists like Roy Lichtenstein on or near the main concourse, called the Promenade, amid a souk of food stalls hawking $12 mahi-mahi tacos and $14 Cuban sandwiches. Nobody seemed to take much notice of the art the other night, fans clustering instead four-deep before a bobble-head-doll display. But Mr. Loria professed not to care. The goal is a mix of visual distractions.
These include two narrow saltwater aquariums behind home plate, giving off a bright blue glow. The intended spirit is light-hearted. For the same reason that Florida's hockey team never installed a panther cage in its rink, it's now clear why no one had put an aquarium in a backstop before. Animal rights activists were traumatized after the team tested the glass with a pitching machine.
The game aside, the main attraction is clearly the kinetic sculpture by the Pop maestro of kitsch, Red Grooms, in left-center field: marlins spin, flamingos flap and water splashes whenever a Marlin hits a homer. Miamians have been competing to come up with a name for it (the Marlinator and the Marlinstrosity are two, so far). This over-the-top gizmo is to the Mets' homely home-run apple what the video game Call of Duty is to a jack-in-the-box. Considering how few homers have been hit so far, the fences might need to be brought in before too long to make sure it is exercised.
Mr. Hershiser was close to the mark about the architecture. Stadiums these days emulate cruise ships. They've got their first-class cabins and exclusive restaurants and nightclubs. (The one at Marlins Park even has a swimming pool.)
The game is no longer necessarily the point for many people who buy a ticket. Baseball used to be a sport of reverie, with the murmur of the crowd, the chatter of announcers on transistor radios and the crack of bats. Now parks are entertainment palaces, telling us when to cheer and selling us overpriced food and merchandise. The longest line I saw on the Promenade was to get into the team's souvenir store.
Retro stadiums catered to nostalgia for an era before steroids and artificial turf, but even the past gets old. Fans may someday come to long for the doughnut stadiums. I almost miss Shea. Whether the tropical colors and aquariums at Marlins Park will appeal to local Latino fans, on whom Miami is relying to fill most of the seats, or play to outsiders' cliches of the city, time will tell.
Sightlines are good. Those at the top and behind the outfield fences feel close to the action, and field-level seats benefit from the narrow foul territory. With the roof closed, Marlins Park is chilled to a dry 75 degrees, a family-friendly environment in which to pass a hot summer day or night. Angled walls and cantilevered ramps on the building's outside create a few elegant geometries, and multicolored tiles provide decorative pizzazz. It's more than what you find in the grim concrete corridors of Yankee Stadium.
Yes, baseball isn't what it used to be -- the modern game panders to the corporations and rich patrons who buy luxury boxes and seats behind home plate. But stadiums are about as close as many cities come today to creating large-scale public spaces. They attract untold numbers of fans who might never have gone to a game back when baseball was played before cigar-chomping men in jackets and fedoras.
''A lot of us weren't expecting something this nice,'' said Adam Brownstein, a 38-year-old native Miamian, who spoke for what seemed like every resident I met.
Ten clubs have opened new homes since 2001. The Phillies thrive in Citizens Bank Park, where they keep winning. Pittsburgh flounders in PNC Park -- which may be the most beautiful of all the parks to be built in recent years -- because the Pirates are perennial losers.
Now that Mr. Loria has gotten his new stadium, he is doling out big money for marquee players, talking about World Series games played with the roof open, under the stars. Through seven home games, according to ESPN, the Marlins have sold an average of more than 29,000 tickets.
If the Marlins are bottom dwellers in late September, that home-run sculpture may come to seem forlorn, the new team uniforms clownish and the cost of the stadium a renewed scandal.
But that's then. For now, Miami has reason to cheer.

HEADLINE: More Than a 'Breath of Fresh Air'

 BODY:
Growing up in the Stanley M. Isaacs Houses on 92nd Street and First Avenue in Manhattan, Yvette Vasquez was never allowed to play outside. But around the projects there was mostly just asphalt littered with crack vials, recalled Ms. Vasquez, who is now 30. ''There was nothing to look forward to,'' she said, until she was 9, when the Fresh Air Fund sent her to spend two glorious weeks with a host family in St. Catharines, Ontario. 
Thanks to Doug and Carol Hardy and their children, Jeff and Erin, Ms. Vasquez got to taste carefree summer life out in the country, learning to fish, to make s'mores, to name flowers. ''I got to be a kid over there,'' she said.
The Hardys became her second family, and Ms. Vasquez continued her visits through the fund until she was 14 and even on her own after that. It changed her life.
The Hardys were the only people she knew who had attended college, and they encouraged her to get an education. Ms. Vasquez, influenced by Mrs. Hardy, who was a nurse, studied occupational therapy at LaGuardia Community College. Today she has a good job in the field.
''Getting away from the city was not just a breath of fresh air for me,'' she said recently. ''It was a geography, history, economics, agriculture and sociology lesson all rolled into one.''
The Fresh Air Fund hopes this year to reach 9,000 New York City children -- 4,000 will stay with host families across 13 states and Canada; 3,000 will go to Fresh Air Fund camps. An additional 2,000 kids will take part in year-round programs. A two-week stay costs the fund $923, and a session at camp is $1,563. These programs are available only to New York City children whose families cannot afford such trips. The fund hopes to raise $11.7 million by the end of September.
Tax-deductible donations can be sent to the Fresh Air Fund, 633 Third Avenue, 14th Floor, New York, N.Y. 10017, or made online at www.freshair.org. Families who wish to be hosts can write to the same address, fill out a host inquiry online or call (800) 367-0003.

HEADLINE: Still Wary On Stocks

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
Americans may be starting to feel more financially secure, but many remain wary of investing in the stock market, a new poll from Bankrate.com finds.
About three fourths of those interviewed for Bankrate's Financial Security Index said they were less inclined to invest in the stock market than they were a year ago. (Those being paid more than $75,000 a year were more inclined to invest in stocks). 
Princeton Survey Research Associates International surveyed 1,000 adults by telephone in early April. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 4 percent.
The overall index rose to a new high of 99.9 (the previous high was 98.5, reached almost a year ago. Bankrate began its monthly financial security polling in December of 2010).
About a third of Americans surveyed for the index said their overall financial situation was better now than it was 12 months ago (compared to about a quarter saying it is now worse). Those under 50 were more likely to say they were better off.
Job security remains a weak spot, however, with just 20 percent saying they felt more secure in their employment than a year ago.
Greg McBride, senior financial analyst at Bankrate, attributed that to the ''lackluster'' job growth reported at the beginning of April, when the survey was conducted. ''That seemed to resonate with consumers,'' he said.
Continued unease about jobs, as well as rising gas prices and the continuing debt crisis in Europe, could weigh on financial security heading into the summer, he said.
Are you leery of investing in the stock market? And are you feeling more secure about your finances, compared with a year ago?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Flicker of Hope Appears in the Housing Market

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
THE boom in housing in the middle of the last decade created a huge oversupply of homes in the United States. But now that oversupply appears to be close to vanishing, at least in most parts of the country.
That reduction of supply does not in itself guarantee a revival for the depressed homebuilding industry, but it does remove one obstacle.
Historically, there was a loose relationship between the population over 16 years of age and the number of new homes sold each year, with an average of 376 homes sold for every 100,000 people from 1963 though 1996. The rate fluctuated with the economy, of course, falling during recessions and when interest rates were high, and rising when the economy recovered or interest rates were declining. But the booms were mild compared with the one that came in the middle of the last decade. Then, when the credit crisis and recession arrived, homebuilding collapsed. 
Combining the boom and the bust, new-home sales have actually adhered to the historical average. From 1997 through March of this year, the average rate was 375 homes sold per 100,000 people. But, during the boom from 1997 until 2007, 1.8 million more new homes were sold than would have been expected under the historic average. Since 2007, two million fewer homes have been sold than would have been expected.
That calculation would seem to indicate that there is no longer a large overhang of available new homes for sale. That is confirmed by government figures indicating that at the end of March, there were only 144,000 new homes for sale, the lowest level since the government began collecting data in 1963. Of those, 48,000 had been finished, with the rest either planned or under construction. In early 2008, 199,000 finished homes were for sale.
The supply has not been exhausted in all areas, of course. Areas where speculation was most intense, like Las Vegas, still may have too many homes available for sale.
A low supply of new homes does not, by itself, affect demand, and there are reasons demand remains subdued. Many new homes are historically sold to homeowners moving up. Those homeowners need buyers for their existing homes, and they may be hard to find now. In addition, many homeowners cannot trade up now because they owe more on their old homes than the houses are worth.
Other impediments to a significant rise in new-home sales include stringent credit standards for new mortgages and the psychological scars left from the collapse in home prices.
There are indications that fewer households have been formed in recent years than would have been expected from population growth. More young adults have stayed with their parents, while other people who lost their homes or jobs were forced to move in with relatives. If and when the economy improves, many of those people could seek housing of their own, creating a sudden increase in demand.
A major reason the recovery from the 2007-9 recession got off to a slow start was the lack of a contribution from the homebuilding industry. That may be changing. In the first quarter of this year, reported Friday, residential investment was estimated to have grown at an annual rate of 19 percent. The figure was up 8.8 percent from the same quarter a year ago, for the largest annual rise since 2004.
Similarly, while sales of new homes remain low by historic standards, the number of sales in the first quarter of this year was up 17 percent from the same period of 2011. That was also the best year-over-year gain since 2004.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Working Off a Housing Oversupply: A major difference between the recovery from the 2007-9 recession and previous recoveries is that residential construction, usually a major contributor to recovery, has contributed very little. In part, that is because the homebuilding industry was a victim of past recessions but a major cause of the most recent one. Overbuilding, brought on by easy credit, left the economy vulnerable. Now, there are some signs that the overbuilding has been worked off. (Sources: Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics, via Haver Analytics)

HEADLINE: Higher Taxes and a Loss in Europe Hurt Ford Profit

BYLINE: By NICK BUNKLEY

 BODY:
DEARBORN, Mich. -- The Ford Motor Company on Friday said that its profit fell by almost half in the first quarter, as higher taxes and a loss in Europe overshadowed improvements in its North American business.
Ford reported net income of $1.4 billion, 45 percent less than the $2.55 billion it earned in the same period of 2011. Revenue declined 2 percent, to $32.4 billion.
Officials attributed about half of the decline to the company's tax rate quadrupling from a year ago. In addition, its European business swung to a $149 million pretax operating loss from a $293 million operating profit. 
Excluding taxes and special items, Ford earned $2.29 billion, or 39 cents a share, its 11th consecutive quarterly operating profit. That is 19 percent less than a year ago, when it earned $2.84 billion, or 47 cents a share, but higher than Wall Street's average estimate of 35 cents.
''Our team delivered a solid performance during the first quarter, with particularly strong results in North America, despite a challenging global external environment,'' Ford's chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, said in a statement. ''We remain focused on investing for future growth and developing outstanding products with segment-leading quality, fuel efficiency, safety, smart design and value.''
Ford earned $2.13 billion in North America, compared with $1.84 billion in the first quarter of 2011. The company said that was the highest quarterly profit for the region since at least 2000, when it began reporting North American results separately.
The improvement was a result of higher sales and prices paid by customers, even as increasing gasoline prices prompted a shift toward smaller vehicles.
Ford's chief financial officer, Robert Shanks, pointed out that Ford's previous high mark in North America came in 2004, when sales volumes were double and customers were flocking to big, expensive sport utility vehicles. Its profit margin last quarter was 11.5 percent, compared to 9.2 percent in 2004.
''We're making that same profit with substantially less volume and with a greater mix of cars versus trucks,'' Mr. Shanks said in a conference call with analysts and reporters.
The automaker recorded positive automotive operating-related cash flow for the eighth consecutive quarter, increasing cash reserves to $23 billion from $21.3 billion a year ago.
Separately, Ford said it would begin offering 90,000 salaried retirees and former employees in the United States the option of taking a lump-sum pension payment, a move that should decrease the liabilities of its underfinanced pension plans.
The payments, which will vary based on an individual's age, years of service and earnings history, are intended to reduce overall obligations and save the pension plans more money in the future than they will have to pay out now. Ford will begin making the offers in July and roll them out over the course of a year.
''This is the first time a program of this type and magnitude has been offered by a U.S. company for ongoing pension plans,'' Ford said in its statement.
Ford's global pension plans had $74 billion in liabilities at the end of 2011 but were underfinanced by $15.4 billion.
For the full year, Ford said it expected operating profit and margins in North America to be ''significantly higher'' than in 2011, allowing global operating profits to be roughly flat. It said operating profit would be higher in the second half than in the first half because of product introductions and production increases, including plants scheduled to open in Thailand and China.
''We feel really good about the quarter and what it portends for the rest of the year,'' Mr. Shanks said. ''It demonstrates not only the much leaner cost structure that we have, but our ability to do well no matter what the customer wants to buy.''
Ford this month increased its industry light-vehicle sales forecast for the United States in 2012 to a range of 14.3 million to 14.8 million. But it said it expected its market share to decline because it would not be able to raise output quickly enough to match the market's growth.
''We just simply can't keep up with what we think will be the level of consumer demand,'' Mr. Shanks said. ''It's not going to affect profitability because we'll still build what we thought we would or a little bit more.''
Ford, like other automakers, has been cautious about increasing production capacity after closing plants and eliminating tens of thousands of jobs in the last decade.
Peter Nesvold, an auto analyst with Jefferies and Company, said Ford's ''extraordinary'' profit margin in North America easily surpassed his and other forecasts. ''These are levels of profitability that few ever expected to see from the Detroit Three,'' he wrote in a note to clients on Friday.
The higher tax rate decreased first-quarter net income by $612 million. At the end of 2011, Ford released a tax-valuation allowance that had reduced its effective tax rate in recent years. The move, which signaled an expectation of considerable profit in the years ahead, added $12.4 billion to its 2011 net income, which totaled $20.2 billion.
The profits and sales gains that Ford has made since 2009 have brought the company closer to regaining control of assets, including its blue oval logo, that it pledged as collateral on more than $23 billion in loans in 2006. The loans allowed Ford to avoid following Chrysler and General Motors into bankruptcy, though it now has more debt on its balance sheet than its Detroit rivals.
Fitch Ratings this week upgraded Ford's credit rating to investment grade, a status it lost in 2005. An investment-grade rating from either Moody's Investors Service or Standard & Poor's, would release the collateral.
Compared to its crosstown rivals, Ford is the furthest along in its recovery from the recession, but all three are now profitable. Chrysler reported first-quarter net income of $473 million on Thursday, a fourfold increase from a year ago. General Motors is expected to report a profit next week, after earning $7.6 billion in all of 2011.

HEADLINE: China Dissident Said To Be Hiding At U.S. Embassy

BYLINE: By ANDREW JACOBS and JONATHAN ANSFIELD; Reporting was contributed by Edward Wong, Sharon LaFraniere, Michael Wines and Jane Perlez from Beijing, and Steven Lee Myers from Washington. Mia Li and Shi Da contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The dramatic nighttime escape of a blind rights lawyer from extralegal house arrest in his village dealt a major embarrassment to the Chinese government and left the United States, which may be sheltering him, with a new diplomatic quandary as it seeks to improve its fraught relationship with Beijing.
The lawyer, Chen Guangcheng, one of the best-known and most politically savvy Chinese dissidents, evaded security forces surrounding his home this week and, aided by an underground network of human rights activists, secretly made his way about 300 miles to Beijing, where he is believed to have found refuge in the American Embassy, according to advocates and Chinese officials.
An official in the Chinese Ministry of State Security on Friday said that Mr. Chen had reached the United States Embassy, but American officials would not confirm reports that Mr. Chen had found shelter there. 
Mr. Chen's escape represents a significant public relations challenge for the Chinese government, which has sought to relegate him to obscurity, confining him to his home in the remote village of Dongshigu and surrounding him with plainclothes security guards, even though there are no outstanding legal charges against him.
The case also poses a major new diplomatic test for the United States. In February, the Obama administration was thrust into an internal Chinese political dispute when Wang Lijun, the former top police official from the region of Chongqing, sought refuge in the American Consulate in Chengdu. Mr. Wang revealed details about the killing of a British businessman, setting off a cascade of events that led to the downfall of Bo Xilai, who was the party chief in Chongqing and a member of China's Politburo. American diplomats said they had determined that Mr. Wang's case did not involve national security, and he was turned over to Chinese officials, prompting criticism from some in Washington about their handling of the case. Both sides insist Mr. Wang left of his own accord.
But with Mr. Chen now believed to be on the grounds of the American Embassy in Beijing, administration officials are likely to be far more cautious in handling his case. His advocacy for the handicapped and for families subject to forced abortions and other coercive population control methods is widely known in the West. He also became a symbol of the deficiencies of China's legal system after he was convicted of criminal charges in 2006 in a prosecution that Chinese lawyers -- and even some officials in Beijing -- felt made a mockery of China's claims to be developing better legal norms.
Mr. Chen, according to those who have spoken to him, slipped away on Sunday evening from his home in Shandong Province, where he has been held incommunicado since his release from prison in September 2010. Ai Weiwei, the artist and government critic who has also been subjected to residential detention, though far less draconian, said he had spoken to a friend who met with Mr. Chen in Beijing on Wednesday. The friend said Mr. Chen had climbed over a wall at night and evaded multiple lines of guards.
''You know he's blind, so the night to him is nothing,'' Mr. Ai said the friend told him. ''I think that's a perfect metaphor.''
Among those who helped Mr. Chen was He Peirong, a family friend who said Mr. Chen had planned his escape far in advance, staying in bed for long periods of time to trick guards into thinking he was too sick to walk. In an account she wrote on her microblog early Friday, Ms. He said that Mr. Chen had called her after fleeing the village. She said she then picked him up in her car, and they drove to Beijing. By late morning on Friday, Ms. He had been taken by public security agents from her home in Nanjing, according to Bob Fu, president of China Aid, a Christian rights group in Texas. Her microblog account was later deleted.
A spokesman for China's foreign minister on Friday said he had no information about the episode, but one intelligence officer expressed bewilderment that Mr. Chen had evaded his local government captors and had probably entered the embassy.
''It's still not clear how this happened,'' the intelligence officer said. ''Was this happenstance, or was it planned this way? Are there others planning to do the same?''
The timing is especially inopportune for Beijing, given that it is preparing to welcome Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner and other American officials next week for the annual Strategic and Economic Dialogue.
A vice foreign minister, Cui Tiankai, said Saturday morning that the meeting would go ahead as planned next week. Mr. Cui also played down the Chen case. ''I don't think this issue will occupy much time or focus,'' he said, regarding the meeting. ''So I have no information for you on it.''
The escape creates headaches for Washington, which has been eager to improve relations with the Chinese on various economic and security issues. Those efforts have lately paid dividends, with Beijing increasingly cooperating with American diplomatic moves to pressure Iran and North Korea over their nuclear programs. China has also shown a willingness to support United Nations efforts to broker a cease-fire in Syria.
Mrs. Clinton has addressed Mr. Chen's case on several occasions, most recently in a speech on Asian policy in November that prompted a sharp rebuke from Beijing. ''We are alarmed by recent incidents in Tibet of young people lighting themselves on fire in desperate acts of protest,'' she said then, ''as well as the continued house arrest of the Chinese lawyer Chen Guangcheng. We continue to call on China to embrace a different path.''
On Friday, however, the State Department's spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, said she would make no comment about Mr. Chen's escape or his whereabouts. The White House also declined to comment, and a scheduled briefing on Mrs. Clinton's planned visit was postponed.
''Chen Guangcheng is a very strong candidate for asylum,'' said Susan L. Shirk, a former State Department official who is now a professor at the University of California, San Diego. ''A blind lawyer who is being persecuted for exposing forced abortions? I don't think there's any question about it.''
But, as in the exploding scandal surrounding Bo Xilai, the Obama administration has sought to keep itself out of China's internal politics.
Rights advocates said Mr. Chen was not seeking to leave China, but would try to negotiate his freedom with the Chinese authorities.
''He is reluctant to go overseas and wants only to live like a normal Chinese citizen,'' said Mr. Fu.
Shortly after news of Mr. Chen's daring escape began circulating, a video appeared on YouTube on Friday, filmed in the days since he gained his freedom, in which he described life under house arrest. The video, in the form of an appeal to Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, detailed the abuse that he and his family suffered.
He told of how his daughter was followed to school by three guards each day and how guards had kicked his wife for hours on end. ''Prime Minister Wen, you owe the people an explanation,'' he said. ''Are these atrocities the result of local officials violating the law or a result of orders from the top leadership?''
It is not the first time that Mr. Chen has sought to publicize the details of his confinement. Last year, he and his wife were reportedly severely beaten after a video they secretly recorded inside their home was smuggled out of the village and posted on the Internet. Friends say the subsequent abuse by their captors had left Mr. Chen in frail health.
Mr. Chen, 40, is a self-taught lawyer, who was once lauded by the state media for his work defending farmers and the disabled. But he angered local officials after taking on the case of thousands of women who had been forcibly sterilized in Linyi County. During a brief trial in 2006, he was sentenced to 51 months in jail on charges of destroying property and assembling a crowd to disrupt traffic -- charges that advocates say were trumped up, given that he was under house arrest at the time.
After his release, he was taken directly to his family's stone farmhouse, which was turned into a makeshift prison. His wife, and for a time his young daughter, were also confined inside the house, which was ringed by surveillance cameras, floodlights and a rotating cordon of guards.
Reporters, diplomats and Chinese activists who tried to visit Mr. Chen were violently repelled by guards.
Rights advocates on Friday expressed concern for Mr. Chen and for his wife, Yuan Weijing, who activists said was left behind. Still, Mr. Fu of China Aid said he was optimistic that Mr. Chen might be able to negotiate his freedom. ''The fact that he's escaped will really shake up Chinese security forces,'' he said. ''It tells them that they are not almighty God.''

HEADLINE: Markets Shrug Off a Disappointing G.D.P. Number

BYLINE: By BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index capped its best week in a month as retailers surged to a record and improving corporate earnings and consumer confidence tempered lower-than-forecast economic growth.
Retailers in the S.& P. 500 climbed 3.5 percent, the biggest gain among 24 groups. Amazon.com and Expedia, an online travel company, surged more than 15 percent as earnings beat estimates. A gauge of home builders in S.& P. indexes rallied 3 percent, to the highest level since October 2008. Starbucks tumbled 5.3 percent as same-store sales trailed analysts' projections.
The S.& P. 500 added 3.38 points, or 0.24 percent, to climb to 1,403.36 on Friday. The benchmark gauge for equities in the United States has rallied 1.8 percent since April 20, for back-to-back weekly gains. 
The Dow Jones industrial average gained 23.69 points, or 0.18 percent, to 13,228.31. The Nasdaq composite index rose 18.59 points, or 0.61 percent, to 3,069.20.
''It all tells me that the economy continues to grow at a slow, steady pace,'' said Jeffrey Layman, chief investment officer of BKD Wealth Advisors in Springfield, Mo. ''Consumers are feeling more confident, and it's a good thing. We're pleased with the overall improvement in earnings.''
Equities rose even after data showed the United States economy expanded at a 2.2 percent annual rate in the first quarter, less than the 2.5 percent increase forecast by economists. Confidence among consumers climbed in April to the highest level in a year, according to a separate report.
Mohamed El-Erian of the Pacific Investment Management Company said that lower-than-forecast growth suggested additional monetary stimulus remained an option for the Federal Reserve, even though there was no immediate need for action.
The rally trimmed this month's decline in the S.& P. 500 to 0.4 percent. The index has gained 12 percent so far this year.
Six out of 10 groups in the S.& P. 500 rose on Friday as companies that rely on consumer discretionary spending and industrial shares had the biggest gains. Ten of 11 stocks in a measure of home builders in S.& P. indexes advanced.
Amazon surged 15.8 percent, to $226.85. The company posted an earnings-per-share figure that was four times the average of analysts' estimates.
Expedia rose 23.5 percent, the most in the S.& P. 500, to $40.31. ''Gross bookings and revenue growth were again driven by strength in our hotel business, with global room-nights growing 24 percent, a nice acceleration from the 19 percent we saw for the fourth quarter,'' Dara Khosrowshahi, the company's chief executive, said in a conference call Thursday.
Vivus, which won federal approval for a pill that treats erectile dysfunction, rose 3 percent, to $25.15, its highest closing mark since 1997.
Starbucks fell 5.3 percent, to $57.43. Sales at stores open at least 13 months rose 7 percent globally in the quarter; analysts had projected a gain of 8.2 percent
Procter & Gamble, the consumer products company, fell 3.6 percent, to $64.44, after it reduced its full-year earnings forecast, with higher costs for raw materials.
Allscripts Healthcare Solutions, which makes clinical software, fell 35.7 percent, the most in the Russell 1000 index, to $10.30. The company cut its earnings forecast for 2012. Its chief financial officer, Bill Davis, will leave the company on May 18, and three directors resigned after disagreeing with a decision to terminate the chairman, Phil Pead.
Interest rates were steady. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 3/32, to 100 18/32, and the yield slipped to 1.94 percent, from 1.95 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Says He Makes History, Then Repeats It

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is making history.
How can New Yorkers know for sure? Mr. Cuomo says so -- and has almost every week since he took office 16 months ago.
On his fifth day in office, he challenged lawmakers to ''write a new page in the history book of New York State government,'' and his administration has done just that more than 80 times, judging by the number of press releases issued by his office that described one of the governor's actions as historic.
Sometimes the accomplishments seemed destined for some history books, like the legalization of same-sex marriage. But the governor has called a loan program for energy-efficient home improvements historic, as well as the creation of a new application process for economic development grants. The establishment of a Medicaid spending commission? That was historic, too.
''There's that word again,'' one Albany reporter, Liz Benjamin of the YNN cable network, noted as she live-blogged a news conference last year. And a Democratic state senator, Ruben Diaz Sr. of the Bronx, mocked the construct as he complained that the governor had staged a signing of the state budget for the news media before the Legislature had finished voting on it last month. 
''Can you imagine: this was history in the making to sign into Law a Budget that had not been approved by the legislature ... only in New York,'' Mr. Diaz wrote. (In his missive, Mr. Diaz reached for the history books himself, declaring, ''The whole situation only reminds me of when Rome was controlled by emperors.'')
An eager student of history and of politics, Mr. Cuomo enjoys analyzing the political footwork of Albany power brokers present and past, and he frequently offers play-by-play commentary on his own administration -- at news conferences, on speaking tours, and in radio interviews, video recordings and news releases.
On New Year's Day, his office sent an e-mail to New Yorkers with the subject: ''A Look Back at a Historic Year.'' In a book his office produced touting his first year's accomplishments, something was described as ''historic'' or history-making every other page -- 21 times over 39 pages.
In appearances around the state, Mr. Cuomo has cued a PowerPoint slide with the proclamation, ''A historic year.''
''Last year's legislative session will go down in the history books as one of the most successful legislative sessions in modern political history,'' Mr. Cuomo told an audience on Long Island in February. He repeated a variation of that line in Plattsburgh the next day, and in case anyone was worried that he was exaggerating, he added, ''Literally.''
Mr. Cuomo rarely needs a thesaurus. When lawmakers passed his budget last year, he championed the spending plan as ''historic'' and ''transformational.'' When they passed his budget this year, he declared it a ''historic'' moment that would spur a ''major transformation'' for the state.
''Politicians as a class seem to be more concerned than most of us about their place in history,'' said Robert Lehrman, who was chief speechwriter for Vice President Al Gore and now teaches at American University. ''This is a sort of thing with a long historical tradition -- I think maybe Plutarch was the first to use the term, though he probably didn't use it in English.''
Mr. Lehrman, who wrote speeches for Mr. Cuomo when he was an assistant federal housing secretary, said Mr. Cuomo's use of ''historic'' probably indicated ''some hapless assistant press secretary in his office has a tic like that.''
Mr. Cuomo's spokesman, Josh Vlasto, was unapologetic for the governor's fondness for history-making.
''Anyone who knows New York knows that New York makes history every day,'' he said. Mr. Cuomo declined to be interviewed for this article , but at a news conference last year, after one of his aides described an overhaul of the state ethics laws as ''historic,'' the governor reflected on the characterization, saying, ''It's a word I think that's often overused in Albany -- 'historic legislation.' '' But that observation did not discourage him. He continued: ''I think it's actually justified today. This is a historic piece of legislation.''
Some say his frequent use of the word comes at the risk of ringing hollow.
''A rich person does not brag about it -- only the nearly rich does,'' said Elvin T. Lim, an associate professor of government at Wesleyan University and the author of ''The Anti-Intellectual Presidency,'' a critique of presidential oratory.
And Martin J. Medhurst, a professor of rhetoric and communication at Baylor University, advised caution.
''Not only does the term lose its power, but it undercuts the credibility of the person saying it,'' he said. ''When people start noticing it over and over, they attribute that to the speaker trying to puff himself up, and that hurts the ethos of a communicator.''
Mr. Cuomo has a history with history. When he was attorney general, many of his accomplishments were also ''historic.'' (''Attorney General Cuomo Expands Historic Health Insurance Reform,'' read one news release.).
His frequent citation of his place in history, according to rhetoricians, provides a frame for how he hopes the public in New York and across the country will view him -- as someone who turned a dysfunctional state capital from a place of corruption to competence.
George Lakoff, a professor of cognitive science and linguistics at the University of California, Berkeley, said Mr. Cuomo, oft-mentioned as a potential Democratic presidential candidate in 2016, is trying to project that ''he realizes that the country has 'historic' challenges, and he has met them in New York and can meet them in the country.'' ''If he's going to run for president,'' Professor Lakoff said, ''he can't just be the so-so son of a great former governor. What he has to do is make his mark on his own.''
Mr. Cuomo's history lessons began early -- his father, Mario M. Cuomo, was a three-term governor renowned for his philosophical oratory. The elder Mr. Cuomo was himself fond of citing history, and at one point, assessing a decade in office, he wrote, ''We have tried to advance, in all areas of our public life, New York's historic governmental mission.''
These days, at the Executive Mansion, the younger Mr. Cuomo recites for guests a history of the sprawling home. At the Capitol, Mr. Cuomo ordered the portraits of his predecessors rehung, and installed new exhibits and a historical timeline in the building. He often alludes to the tenure of previous governors (not always in flattering ways) and he refers proudly to New York's historic role in the women's suffrage and workers' rights movements.
''Be proud -- you're part of history,'' Mr. Cuomo said was the message he hoped would be sent by calling attention to history in the Capitol's halls. ''And it's true. And when you think of what you're doing that way, through that lens, you know, it brings you to a different place.''

HEADLINE: Turning TVs Into Tablets

BYLINE: By AMY CHOZICK and NICK WINGFIELD

 BODY:
The same consumers who delight in navigating the iPad still click frustratingly through cable channels to find a basketball game. Their complaint: Why can't television be more like a tablet?
The technology industry is trying to address that question for the millions of customers ready to embrace the next generation of viewing options. In the process it could transform the clunky cable interface, with its thousands of channels and a bricklike remote control, into a series of apps that pop up on the television screen.
While still in its early stages, the idea has taken off among tech-loving consumers, and companies are trying to satisfy them. Already, apps for Hulu Plus, Netflix and Wal-Mart's Vudu streaming service, among others, are built into Internet-enabled televisions. Devices like Microsoft's Xbox 360 and the streaming video player Roku let viewers watch apps that mimic channels. New sets by Samsung and others come with built-in apps loaded with television shows, movies and sports. 
Apple has a video player called Apple TV with apps to Netflix, Major League Baseball and other content. Many media executives predict Apple will ultimately enter the television market in a more aggressive way, with either a new set-top box or an Apple-made TV set. Both would rely on apps scattered across the screen as they are on the iPad. Apple declined to comment.
''I've told my bosses, 'This is beachfront real estate. Buy in now,' '' Lisa Hsia, executive vice president of digital media at NBCUniversal's Bravo channel, said of developing TV apps.
A model built around TV apps, however, could let viewers use favorite apps on the screen on an a la carte basis, thus bypassing cable subscriptions and all the extraneous channels they don't watch. And therein lies the tension that has the television industry delicately assessing how to balance the current system with an Internet-based future that some feel is inevitable.
''The question that hasn't yet been answered is whether television viewing will consist of a single app that mimics the pay TV bundle or a series of different apps that together form a content experience,'' said Jon Miller, the chief digital officer at News Corporation, which owns Fox Broadcasting and cable channels like Fox News and FX.
A la carte apps would upend the entrenched and lucrative economics of television, which have long relied on a system in which cable customers pay for channels even if they don't watch them.
The so-called bundle setup helps little-watched channels bring in revenue from monthly cable fees and allows the most popular channels to get high fees from every subscriber, even the ones who don't watch them.
The idea of undermining this model is so sensitive that media executives who think that apps are the future of television would not discuss the subject publicly, for fear of disturbing their cable and satellite partners.
But many analysts caution against predicting the near-term demise of cable and satellite delivery, pointing out that the spending and viewing habits of consumers are also firmly entrenched.
''The model we have is the model we have, and while it's tempting to imagine an app for TNT and an app for ESPN, that's not the likely outcome,'' said Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. A la carte apps might seem like a bright idea, Mr. Moffett said, but it is unlikely consumers would pay $20 a month for individual channels when the traditional cable bundle provides a bargain price.
Currently, most TV apps created by networks work on an authentication model that requires cable subscribers to log in before gaining access to a channel's app. The handful of apps already available on television screens also largely require a cable subscription.
For the most part, the apps being offered today are intended as complements to traditional TV viewing and are available only on tablets and mobile devices. For instance, NBC Sports will soon introduce its NBC Olympics Live Extra app, which will allow subscribers to stream every Olympic event from London this summer. It is available only on iPads, tablets and other mobile devices, not on TV screens through Xbox or Roku.
''No one on the digital side wants to take away audience from the TV,'' said Rick Cordella, vice president and general manager for NBC Sports Digital.
Time Warner's HBO still relies heavily on the cable bundle because it does not have the customer service or sales force of a company like Comcast or Time Warner Cable. But HBO Go does allow subscribers to have access to the pay channel's library of almost every series, movie, documentary and heavyweight fight directly on the TV screen, via the Xbox.
''The HBO Go app is seen as a doorway into the entire world of HBO programming,'' said Eric Kessler, co-president at HBO. ''That adds tremendous value to the subscription.''
As such, HBO Go could help the channel lay the groundwork to eventually break out on its own on an a la carte basis, even if that might not happen soon, said James McQuivey, an analyst at Forrester Research. ''HBO has the largest subscriber base of any video service in the world, but they know none of their customers by name,'' Mr. McQuivey, said. ''That will be a huge liability in the future. HBO knows that; that's why they need a direct relationship.''
The ability of any channel to strike out on its own, even strong ones like HBO or the Walt Disney Company's ESPN, remains problematic. ESPN makes about $5 a month from each of the country's more than 100 million cable subscribers. If ESPN ever sold its live sports and talk shows directly to the consumer, it would need to charge several times that rate. ''We have no plans to bisect our partnerships with distributors,'' said Sean Bratches, the ESPN executive vice president for sales and marketing.
But just as with previous transformations in television, the economics will have to catch up as technology evolves, said Jeremy Allaire, chief executive of Brightcove, a technology firm based in Boston that builds apps for media companies.
By 2014, an estimated 89.5 million people in the United States will use tablet computers, up from 54.8 million users in 2012, according to the research firm eMarketer. ''You have to achieve scale before the economics will work,'' Mr. Allaire said. ''But at some point, we think direct-to-consumer will be very important.''
That model may prove attractive to smaller cable channels, many of whom dislike how they are buried within the traditional electronic guides that viewers use to navigate their cable boxes.
Bigger cable channels may find it appealing as well. The head of digital strategy at one major channel said he was excited about the idea of having an app that sat on the home screen of a television. It would provide a ''safer passage'' to eventually sell the channel directly to customers, rather than through a cable package, said the executive, who declined to be identified to avoid upsetting the company's cable partners.
Cable and satellite companies have sped up the development of their own TV apps in the hope that they will eventually mimic the set-top box. In an ideal cable industry model, customers will have one or two apps that offer hundreds of channels rather than dozens of apps for individual networks. ''You download all these apps, and then you get app fatigue,'' said Matt Strauss, Comcast Cable's senior vice president for digital and emerging platforms.
''Apps create amazing experiences,'' Mr. Strauss said. ''But I believe most customers and households are still looking for an aggregated experience that's intuitive and personalized.''

PERSON: Enoch H. Williams 

HEADLINE: Enoch Williams, 84, New York Councilman

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
Enoch H. Williams, a former New York City councilman who used his leadership positions to pass a law banning smoking in most public spaces and to help stop the Giuliani administration from selling city-owned hospitals, but who also came under fire from gay rights groups, died on Tuesday at his home in Heathrow, Fla. He was 84. 
His wife, Marian, confirmed the death.
Mr. Williams was a moderate Democrat who represented the largely minority Brooklyn neighborhoods of Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brownsville, East Flatbush and Crown Heights for five terms, from 1978 to 1997. As chairman of the Council's Health Committee during his last term, he was a principal force behind the law that in 1994 banned smoking in restaurants, offices and many outdoor locations.
The same year, when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani proposed selling city hospitals to private companies, Mr. Williams was a leader in taking the administration to court. In its lawsuit, the Council argued that the mayor had overstepped his authority in proposing the sale of hospitals in Coney Island and other neighborhoods. The Court of Appeals, New York State's highest court, agreed.
Mr. Williams, who had opposed a series of gay rights bill in the 1980s, drew protests from gay activists after being quoted by The New York Post as saying that the city had helped spread AIDS by ''condoning homosexuality.'' Despite Mr. Williams's insistence that he had been misquoted, activists interrupted a Council meeting with demands for his resignation and shouts of ''Help me! I'm dying'' and ''You are killing us!''
He countered that as the representative of minority communities, he felt compelled to question whether gay groups were getting more federal and state resources than black and Hispanic agencies that served populations in which AIDS had become rampant.
''I fully recognize that gay and lesbian civil rights do not cause AIDS,'' he told a news conference. ''Ignorance causes AIDS.''
Mr. Williams was also publicly criticized for opposing a public health program that had been set up to inhibit the spread of AIDS by distributing clean needles to drug users. He said he worried that free needles would encourage drug use.
Enoch Hill Williams was born in Wilmington, N.C., on June 21, 1927. His father died when he was very young, and his mother took him to live in Harlem. He served in the Army during World War II and the Korean War. He received a bachelor's degree in business management from Long Island University and studied urban renewal at New York University and the New School. He then ran a coin laundry business and a church housing program.
Mr. Williams held the rank of major general in the New York Guard, the part of the state militia responsible for military jobs within the state. He was the first black person to command one of the four active units of the state militia.
Mr. Williams was for many years the civilian director of the selective service system in New York City. He was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention three times and in 2008 was one of 27 presidential electors in Florida.
His first marriage ended in divorce. In addition to his wife, he is survived by his sons, Kamau Bandele Kokayi and Robert Williams; his daughter, Chareese Adamson; his stepson, Derrick Johnson; his stepdaughter, Yolonda Johnson; 17 grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Economic Growth Slows Unexpectedly to 2.2%

BYLINE: By SHAILA DEWAN

 BODY:
The economic recovery slowed more than expected early this year, raising fears of a spring slowdown for the third year in a row and giving Republicans a fresh opportunity to criticize President Obama's policies.
The United States gross domestic product grew at an annual rate of 2.2 percent in the first quarter, down from 3 percent at the end of last year, according to a preliminary report released Friday. It was the first deceleration in a year, but it was not nearly as severe as other setbacks in the last couple of years.
Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has been hammering on economic issues all week, insisting that the president has held back the recovery and intends to do further damage. 
But the White House focused on the bright spots in the report, like solid growth in consumer spending and a surge in residential building.
''When you look at the report in the totality, I think it shows that the private sector is continuing to heal from the financial crisis,'' said Alan Krueger, chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers. Congress should pass elements of the president's jobs plan, he said, like one that would subsidize the employment of teachers and first responders to emergencies. ''We would like to see the pace of economic growth pick up, and those additional measures which the president proposed are well targeted to the areas of weakness in the economy now.''
Representative Kevin Brady, a Republican from Texas and vice chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, called the numbers ''beyond disappointing.''
''The damage being done by the Obama administration's policies have produced a weak recovery,'' he wrote in a statement.
The American economy has been growing since the second half of 2009, coming close to a 4 percent growth rate in early 2010 before faltering. Growth slowed nearly to a halt in the first quarter of 2011 but accelerated throughout the rest of the year.
The first-quarter growth was weaker than expected. United States stock markets largely shrugged it off, however, perhaps in part because the country is growing while many economies are contracting.
Economists initially predicted a much weaker showing in the latest quarter, partly because of a large accumulation of inventories in the fall and winter that needed to be worked off. But in the last few weeks, expectations rose on strong jobs reports and rising consumer confidence.
Consumer spending did turn out to be the major strength early this year, growing 2.9 percent compared with 2.1 percent in the last quarter of 2011. Business investment, which had been a bright spot, declined in the most recent quarter.
Government spending also fell more than anticipated, lopping more than half a percentage point off total growth, thanks in part to a particularly large drop in military outlays.
Many economists pointed out that consumer spending, mostly on cars and other large items, seemed to have come at a cost. Consumer savings declined. That suggests that spending growth could become unsustainable as households exhaust their reserves. But estimates of personal income tend to be revised upward, and past declines in the savings rate have been erased by later estimates.
Economists were also troubled by the decline in business investment. Businesses spent more on equipment and software but much less on infrastructure. Some of that decrease was expected because a tax break for capital investment expired at the end of the year.
By far the steepest decline in investment in the first quarter was in construction related to mining, oil and gas, while manufacturers actually increased their spending on factories and office buildings.
Mark Zandi of Moody's Analytics said the low investment numbers showed that businesses remained ''very cautious.''
Growth in residential housing swelled by 19 percent, the fourth consecutive increase in that much-diminished sector and the first time it has shown a straight year of growth since 2005. Economists argued over how much of that increase -- and, for that matter, the surprising strength in consumer spending -- was caused by the unseasonably warm winter.
Other factors that contributed to the growth have already appeared to soften, contributing to fears of another false dawn. Shipments of durable goods increased last month, but new orders showed the steepest drop since January 2009. The trade balance improved, but job growth weakened and, more recently, new claims for unemployment benefits have risen.
''The G.D.P. report was disappointing,'' economists at Morgan Stanley wrote. ''The mix of activity pointed to slower growth ahead.''
But Ian Shepherdson of High Frequency Economics dismissed fears of another significant slowdown, saying that last year's hiccup was the result of a series of external shocks, like a spike in gas prices (this year's was less severe and is already subsiding) and the Japanese earthquake.
''What have we got this year that's comparable?'' he asked. ''Nothing. Europe is sort of a constant rather than a variable now.''
A growth rate of 2.2 percent is barely enough to nudge the unemployment rate down, and it is substantially lower than the 3 percent that is considered the comfort zone for incumbent presidents.
''I don't think the issue is whether or not the growth rate is sustainable,'' said Steven Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research. ''I think the question is whether the growth rate that's sustainable is acceptable -- politically and socially acceptable.''
Still, 2.2 percent was enough to generate envy in Europe, where many countries are already in recession and where this week Britain announced that it had entered the dreaded ''double dip.'' Stagnation in Europe and a slowing of China's breakneck expansion have weakened global demand even as corporate profits have continued to outpace expectations.

HEADLINE: Opponents Pounce as Obama Trumpets the Killing of Bin Laden

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER and MICHAEL D. SHEAR; Scott Shane contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Presidents running for re-election typically boast of programs they created, people they helped or laws they signed. They talk about rising test scores or falling deficits or expanding job rolls. President Obama is increasingly taking the unusual route of bragging about how he killed a man.
To be sure, that man was Osama bin Laden, and he is not mourned among either the president's supporters or detractors. But in the days leading up to the first anniversary of the raid that finally caught up to the Qaeda mastermind, Mr. Obama has made a concerted, if to some indecorous, effort to trumpet the killing as perhaps the central accomplishment of his presidency.
Mr. Obama has used the rarefied setting of the Situation Room to give an interview about how he made the decision to send in Special Operations forces. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. gave a speech saying the re-election slogan would be ''Bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive.'' The president's campaign released a Web video showing former President Bill Clinton praising Mr. Obama's fortitude, as it questioned whether Mitt Romney would have made the same decision. 
Other presidents have boasted of their toughness, of course, notably Mr. Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush, who campaigned for re-election in 2004 on a record of having deposed Saddam Hussein in Iraq, while his vice president, Dick Cheney, warned that electing John Kerry could lead to a terrorist attack. But few presidents have talked about the killing of an individual enemy in such an expansive way.
No doubt, the raid on a house in Abbottabad, Pakistan, a year ago Tuesday is a more favorable story for the president politically than the latest report showing slowing economic growth. With the general election effectively under way, it is part of an effort by both sides to define Mr. Obama's presidency.
Senator John McCain of Arizona, Mr. Obama's Republican opponent four years ago, lashed out at the Web video, saying the president was turning ''the one decision he got right into a pathetic, political act of self-congratulation.'' He added, ''Shame on Barack Obama for diminishing the memory of September 11th and the killing of Osama bin Laden by turning it into a cheap political attack ad.''
Heading into a weekend in which Mr. Obama will appear with the comedian Jimmy Kimmel before a star-studded crowd at the White House Correspondents' Association dinner, Mr. Romney and his allies once again tried to turn Mr. Obama's own celebrity against him.
A Web video released this week by American Crossroads, a Republican ''super PAC,'' made the case that the president's focus on image had preoccupied him from more important issues, mocking his mingling with the stars, including his ''slow-jamming the news'' with Jimmy Fallon on ''Late Night'' this week.
''Four years ago, America elected the biggest celebrity in the world, and Americans got one cool president,'' the video says amid grim images and statistics on out-of-work recent college graduates. ''But after four years of a celebrity president, is your life any better?''
The Romney team amplified the message on Friday in a memorandum from the campaign manager, Matt Rhoades, arguing that Mr. Obama was counting on ''his winning TV persona'' for re-election. ''This election will be decided by adults casting their ballots in their precincts, not teenagers texting votes from in front of their television sets,'' Mr. Rhoades wrote. ''That apparently frightens the president and his advisers.''
The contrast between the two campaign videos could not be starker. Set to ominous music and narrated by Mr. Clinton, the Bin Laden video describes the life-or-death stakes that confronted Mr. Obama and shows him standing silhouetted in front of an Oval Office window, shouldering the burdens of a nation.
The ad then presents Mr. Romney as if he were the one not ready to lead, saying, ''Which path would Mitt Romney have taken?''
Claiming public credit for national security victories has long been a balancing act for presidents. Mr. Bush was criticized when a Republican ad showed pictures of ground zero.
Mr. Obama has been finding ways of talking about the Bin Laden raid for months. When a reporter asked in December about charges that he was appeasing the nation's enemies, Mr. Obama offered a strikingly blunt retort. ''Ask Osama bin Laden and the 22 out of 30 top Al Qaeda leaders who have been taken off the field whether I engage in appeasement,'' he said. ''Or whoever's left out there about that.''
He then cited his leadership in the Bin Laden raid both in the opening passages of his State of the Union address in January and again in the closing sections, always making sure to credit the military and intelligence agencies. But the focus has intensified with the approach of the anniversary. On Thursday, he gave an interview to Brian Williams of NBC News in the Situation Room.
Tony Fratto, a deputy press secretary under Mr. Bush, said that it was ''unseemly'' to use the room for such a purpose. ''I don't believe it ever would have occurred to us to conduct an interview in the Situation Room,'' he said, ''and don't believe we would have considered it appropriate.''
Joshua Earnest, Mr. Obama's deputy press secretary, said the White House was responding to news media requests. ''There certainly is interest around the one-year anniversary, so I'd be surprised if nobody asked about it in the context of the one-year anniversary,'' he said.
Martha Joynt Kumar, a Towson University specialist in presidential communication, said it was not surprising that Mr. Obama would use the Situation Room to argue his case. ''When they are running for re-election, presidents favor discussions of their successes,'' she said. ''The killing of Bin Laden is a natural item for President Obama to highlight.''
The anniversary has rekindled some of the longstanding debates about the methods that Mr. Bush and Mr. Obama have used to combat terrorism. Jose A. Rodriguez Jr., a former top Central Intelligence Agency official, defended the harsh interrogations of prisoners under Mr. Bush by contrasting them with Mr. Obama's use of drones to kill suspected terrorists.
''How could it be more ethical to kill people rather than capture them?'' he asked in a segment taped for Sunday's episode of ''60 Minutes'' on CBS.
An official familiar with a still-incomplete investigation by the Democratic staff of the Senate Intelligence Committee said the evidence did not support Mr. Rodriguez's assertion that the rough methods, widely condemned as torture, were necessary.

HEADLINE: Ignoring Obama's Veto Threat, House Passes Student Loan Bill

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Moments after an unusual fiery appeal from Speaker John A. Boehner, the House ignored a veto threat from President Obama and voted 215 to 195 on Friday to prevent a doubling of student loan rates.
The bill, which would strip $5.9 billion from a program within the health care law to pay to keep rates on subsidized undergraduate loans at 3.4 percent, is all but certain to fail in the Senate, where lawmakers have put together their own measure to keep the rate from reverting to 6.8 percent by closing tax loopholes for some wealthy business owners.
While the House legislation has little chance of becoming law in its current form, the bill -- the last piece of legislation considered before a one-week recess -- was an instructive metaphor for the current state of Congressional politics. 
As with other measures designed to appeal to middle-class voters, the fight between Democrats and Republicans was less over the substance of the bill than how to pay for it, with Republicans, as they have all year, looking to cut government spending and Democrats, as has been their approach, looking to extract more money from high earners.
Republicans, continuing their yearlong assault on the health care law, proposed it as a source for the money while Democrats, persisting with their accusation that the other party has been waging a ''war on women,'' pushed that meme further, arguing that the money would reduce spending on preventive health programs.
In an election-year twist, 13 Democrats, largely moderates facing tough re-election fights, actually pushed the bill to passage, because 30 Republicans voted against the measure, either because they did not believe in a subsidized loan program or the short-term nature of the solution. Tellingly, hours before the vote, the Club for Growth, a conservative pro-business group, issued a warning against voting for the bill.
''That's the work of Congress now,'' fumed Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont. ''They go to their trick bag, which is to eviscerate the health care bill. We go to our trick bag, which is to vilify the oil companies, and nobody in the country cares. But what they do care about is getting whacked because they can't pay college costs.''
Both sides immediately moved to paint the other as anti-college student. ''Seven-term Congresswoman Shelley Berkley today chose to allow student loan interest rates to spike rather than eliminate a wasteful 'Obamacare' slush fund,'' Senator Dean Heller, Republican of Nevada, who faces a challenge from Ms. Berkley, a Democrat, in November, said in a statement.
Mr. Obama has been traversing the country, especially swing states, pushing for the continuation of the current rate, which was set by Democrats in 2007 through legislation that temporarily reduced interest rates for the seven million low- and middle-income undergraduates who receive subsidized Stafford loans. The rate dropped to 3.4 percent from 6.8 percent and is scheduled to revert to the higher figure in July without Congressional intervention. Graduate students with Stafford loans pay the higher rate, as do students with unsubsidized Stafford loans.
With partisan accusations flying on the House floor, Mr. Boehner made an unusual appearance Friday to denounce the other party.
''Ladies and gentlemen, this is beneath us,'' he barked. ''This is beneath the dignity of this House and the dignity of the public trust that we enjoy from our constituents!''
After denouncing Democrats for several minutes for not embracing the Republican proposal and saying instead that it would cut off health care services to women and children, Mr. Boehner added, to thunderous applause from his side of the aisle: ''To pick this big political fight where there is no fight is just silly. Give me a break!''
Mr. Boehner has spent much of the week sharply criticizing the president in escalating language and tone, setting the stage for a bitter and nasty finish to a deeply divisive legislative session.
Representative Judy Biggert, a moderate Republican from Illinois who had the job of carrying the House bill and is in a tough re-election fight, seemed almost deflated by the challenge to her measure. ''It just seems this is so hard to do in this political time,'' she said on the floor of the House, adding: ''I know that everybody agrees on the program itself and how we have to do it, but we can't seem to do anything without giving a cynical view. It bothers me.''
Republicans also pointed out that Democrats were willing to raid $5 billion from the Prevention and Public Health Fund, set up as part of the health care law, to help pay for a the payroll tax cut extension this year. There is currently $11.9 billion in the fund; under the bill passed by the House, all of those funds would be repealed; the bill directs $5.9 billion to pay for the one-year interest rate freeze and puts the remainder toward deficit reduction.
However, the White House has already issued a veto threat that read in part: ''This is a politically motivated proposal and not the serious response that the problem facing America's college students deserves.''

HEADLINE: Political Memo: Europe's Ills Reach the Heart of the Presidential Race

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON; Jonathan Weisman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Mitt Romney effectively wrapped up the Republican presidential nomination. Newt Gingrich said he would drop out. President Obama stumped through key swing states. But there's a case to be made that the developments this week with the greatest long-term meaning for American politics took place across the Atlantic, not in Washington or New Hampshire or Iowa.
In Britain, the economy lapsed into a double-dip recession, a result in part of a strict fiscal austerity plan imposed by the conservative government. And political tremors swept across the Continent as the European Union engaged in a fierce battle over whether Germany is demanding excessively deep budget cuts in the effort to keep debtor countries from financial collapse.
At a minimum, Europe's woes could create another headwind for the United States economy. More broadly, events there, as distant as they might appear to voters here, have a direct bearing on the central debate in the presidential campaign, over the size and role of government and the degree and timing of deficit reduction necessary to forestall a long-term fiscal crisis. 
But whichever side of the ocean you are on, few topics are more ideologically divisive than fiscal policy, so it's no surprise that left and right are drawing very different conclusions from what is happening.
From one perspective, the European experience provides yet more evidence that trying to slash budget deficits too aggressively can backfire in a big way when economies in most nations remain fragile.
Britain's austerity experiment in particular has been judged by economists to have been ill-timed and poorly constructed at best. It is a reminder, in the consensus view, that the basic tenets of Keynesian economics - primarily, that government spending plays a key role in maintaining demand when the private sector is struggling in a severe financial crisis -- remain as valid as ever.
In the United States, the British experience is being held up, by Democrats and mainstream economists, as an object lesson in the risks inherent in aggressive short-term budget-cutting amid signs that the recovery could be losing traction again.
However flawed the stimulus plan Mr. Obama pushed through Congress more than three years ago, fiscal policy has helped the United States generate stronger growth rates coming out of the recession than Britain or the euro zone countries.
''The U.K. made a stupid mistake,'' said Ian Shepherdson, an economist at High Frequency Economics. ''Theoretically, the U.S. is in a less-bad situation than the U.K. to deal with fiscal tightening - but less-bad does not mean good.''
From another perspective, the European upheaval is a warning that cleaning up the mess from chronic over-borrowing is a long and deeply painful process, both economically and politically, and that the best option is to clamp down on government profligacy before it gets out of hand.
To many Republicans, Europe today represents what will happen to the United States if it does not act now to rein in spending, cut taxes and free businesses from many of the costs of regulation.
''What we're seeing here is what happens when politicians make so many empty promises to their citizens, and then they turn into broken promises when they can't keep spending other people's money,'' said Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the Republican chairman of the House Budget Committee.
Mr. Ryan's recent budget proposal embodies the conservative view that shrinking government in an immediate and substantial way will clear the way for more robust private sector growth and remove the threat of the United States being brought down by a mountain of debt.
''We're trying to pre-empt austerity,'' Mr. Ryan told Jonathan Weisman of The Times on Thursday. ''We want to prevent that bitter kind of European austerity mode which is what we will have if we have a debt crisis: austerity round after austerity round after austerity round, cutting benefits to current seniors, cutting people in the safety net, raising taxes, slowing down your economy, making it harder for youth to get employed and get careers. That's what you do after a debt crisis hits.''
The problems facing Greece and the other most deeply troubled European economies are different from what is facing the United States in many ways, including scale. The United States, unlike, Europe, faces little immediate pressure from financial markets and has the ability to operate its fiscal and monetary policy in tandem, while European governments gave up direct national control of monetary policy when they agreed to adopt a common currency.
But the comparisons to Britain, which stayed out of the currency union and now has a government very much in synch philosophically with the Republican Party in Washington, are far more direct in both political and economic terms.
Mr. Ryan's plan proposes roughly the same scale of deficit reduction as is being sought by the British government. The British budget calls from reducing that nation's deficit from a current level of 8.3 percent of gross domestic product to 1.1 percent in five years, while the Ryan plan would bring the deficit in the United States from 7.6 percent of G.D.P. to 0.9 percent over the same period purely through spending cuts.
Mr. Obama's budget proposal, which cuts spending more gradually than the Ryan plan, has a goal of reducing the deficit to 2.5 percent of G.D.P. in five years.
To Democrats and economists outside the partisan wars, the results in Britain leave little room for argument. Austerity in the short run, they say, does not strengthen economies still recovering from severe credit crunches of the sort that sent the United States into its deepest downturn since the Great Depression.
Conservatives, in a familiar echo of a long-running domestic argument, say the problem with the austerity plan put in place by Prime Minister David Cameron's coalition government in Britain is not that it was ill-timed or too aggressive, but that it relied too heavily on tax increases.
About a third of its deficit reduction comes from higher revenues. Mr. Ryan's plan contains no tax increases, and Mr. Obama calls for tax increases to make up about a third of his deficit reduction plan.
''The problem with the British consolidation was too much tax increase,'' said Kevin A. Hassett, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who co-authored a study concluding that successful fiscal tightening plans tend to be those that rely on spending cuts for at least 80 percent of deficit reduction.
If there is any shared lesson from Europe, it is that the United States cannot afford to let the clashes over budget cutting in the short term keep it from finding some consensus on how to begin addressing the mounting long-term costs of supporting an aging population. At some point, the two parties will have to reach some kind of compromise to fix the imbalances looming in the decades ahead - something Mr. Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner came tantalizingly close to achieving last year.
''It's not an issue of whether the U.S. has to go through a fiscal consolidation,'' said Domenico Lombardi, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and president of the Oxford Institute for Economic Policy. ''It's a matter of devising an appropriate pace at which the U.S. can credibly and sustainably consolidate.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In Virginia, 2 Ex-Governors Vie For Senate and Balance of Power

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. -- Seven months before Virginia voters elect their next United States senator, former Gov. Tim Kaine, the Democrats' choice for the slot, was rallying a college crowd here, trying to impress upon them the magnitude of the decision to come.
The swing seat in a swing state will decide control of the Senate, Mr. Kaine, 54, told about 400 people gathered on the city's gracious pedestrian mall. ''It is going to be very, very close,'' he warned. ''I don't mind it, because I'm a close specialist. Close is what I know and close is what I do. I'm like the Buy-Your-Maalox candidate.''
The day before and 60 miles to the north, another former governor, George Allen, was making much the same pitch to the patrons of the Raven's Nest Coffee House in Culpeper. ''Where Virginia goes will determine where the Senate goes,'' said Mr. Allen, 60, who narrowly lost the seat six years ago in a Democratic show of power and now wants it back. ''This is the 51st Senate seat.'' 
It is a debatable assertion, with so many Senate seats up for grabs in November, from Montana to Missouri to Massachusetts. But no other race appears to be quite so evenly matched, featuring two former governors with near-universal name recognition, rich campaign war chests and national patrons. It is seen by those on both sides as potentially decisive when it comes to party control of the Senate.
Mr. Kaine, then the national Democratic Party chairman, was dragged into the race reluctantly after the current Democratic senator, Jim Webb, announced his retirement after a single term. During six agonizing weeks, Mr. Kaine was pressed hard by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee to drop his chairmanship and re-enter electoral politics. He consulted former and current Virginia senators, including John W. Warner, a Republican, and Mark Warner, a Democrat. Finally he talked it over at length with President Obama before announcing last April that he had changed his mind and would run.
For Mr. Allen, 2012 is about redemption. He was once considered a leading presidential prospect and a rising Republican star. Then came 2006 and his stumbling, bumbling campaign for re-election, followed by defeat at the hands of Mr. Webb, a political neophyte. The fatal hiccup may have come when he introduced a dark-skinned Democratic Party ''tracker'' filming his every move as ''macaca.'' The incident quickly escalated into a racial controversy.
Mr. Allen really never stopped running after he lost his re-election campaign by a few thousand votes. He barnstormed Virginia for a succession of Republican candidates before restarting his own political career months later. Once again, the Virginia Democratic Party has deployed a tracker, a dark-skinned, bearded young man. But Mr. Allen is more prepared. ''I lost my last election,'' he told the gathering at the Raven's Nest. ''It was a close loss. It was a humbling experience. But sometimes you learn more from losing than winning.''
The contest will play out in a state as purple as any in the nation, divided by race and geography, prosperity and poverty -- and critical to the balance of power in Washington, both on Capitol Hill and the White House. And the winner may be determined as much by the larger forces of presidential politics as by the two candidates' rich histories in Virginia, for better or for worse.
''It's going to be a close election, no question about it,'' Mr. Allen said in an interview.
Polling bears that out. The race has fluctuated between an Allen advantage of seven percentage points in a Roanoke College poll released in early April to a three-point edge for Mr. Kaine in a mid-March Quinnipiac University poll. In both surveys, the difference between the candidates is within each poll's margin of sampling error.
In past Virginia elections, Republicans have been able to marshal their strengths in conservative rural areas of south and central Virginia, disaffected Appalachia and military-dominated Norfolk to overwhelm urban Democratic pockets. But the growth of Washington's Northern Virginia suburbs -- with their affluent, educated core and ethnic polyglot -- has changed the political equation.
The election in 2001 of Mr. Warner as Virginia's governor -- and Mr. Kaine as his lieutenant governor -- reinvented the Democratic Party's brand; from liberal and ideological to technocratic and practical. Mr. Warner, a telecommunications entrepreneur, bequeathed his almost nonpartisan image to Mr. Kaine, who succeeded him as governor in 2005. A year later, former Navy Secretary Jim Webb, another loosely affiliated Democrat, shocked the political establishment by beating the heavily favored Mr. Allen by 9,329 votes.
After Mr. Warner's election to the Senate in 2008, and Mr. Obama's historic Virginia victory, Republicans stormed back in 2009 when Bob McDonnell won the governorship with an economic message that recaptured the Washington suburbs. The outcome of 2012 is anybody's guess.
''After the primaries, the race will be who can get to the middle first with the bulk of his credibility intact,'' said Chris LaCivita, a Republican consultant close to Mr. Allen. ''Whoever can accomplish that is the one that will win the election.''
Both men have liabilities on that front. Mr. Kaine's main pitch is on the micro level, revolving around distinctly nonpartisan issues: his support of a permit for a clean coal plant in Wise County, the recruiting of businesses to the state, and the passage of higher education bond measures that built a Bioscience Center in Harrisonburg and the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine in Roanoke.
But he is already campaigning on the back of Mr. Warner, who remains one of the state's most popular, least polarizing figures. On a recent swing through the foothills of the Appalachians, Mr. Kaine and Mr. Warner ran something of a buddy show, with Mr. Warner delivering most of the punch lines and Mr. Kaine playing his straight man.
It is understandable why Mr. Kaine wants to stay joined at the hip with Mr. Warner. The other hip he would be joined at belongs to Mr. Obama, a considerably more polarizing figure who selected him as his Democratic National Committee chairman in 2009, then personally recruited him to run for the Senate when Mr. Webb announced his retirement. ''His hand-picked senator,'' Mr. Allen sniffed in Culpeper. Republicans say that association has significantly damaged Mr. Kaine's nonpartisan appeal.
''He was a do-nothing governor, and he was with Obama the last year of his governorship,'' grumbled Charlene Sprinkle, 64, a Lynchburg resident who was shopping in Culpeper's quaint antebellum downtown the day Mr. Allen was dropping by.
Mr. Allen's rush to the center faces two high hurdles, his own history and the demands of his base. Unlike Mr. Kaine, Mr. Allen has always been a partisan. At his state's 1994 Republican convention, he promised to knock the Democrats' ''soft teeth down their whiny throats.''
And then there is ''macaca.'' Voters, pro-Allen and con, have not forgotten it.
''The 'macaca' moment, who forgets that?'' laughed Ian Fitzsimmons, 53, of Culpeper.
It is a testament to Mr. Allen's name and reputation that he still nearly won in 2006 even after the ''moment'' -- and in a powerfully Democratic year. But advisers to both the Allen and Kaine campaigns say the Virginia of 2012 is not the same as the Virginia of 2006, especially with the first black president running for re-election. A more diverse state will require more political sensitivity.
But Mr. Allen is trying to keep his cool and maintain his path to the center as he navigates a Republican primary on June 12 that few believe he will lose.
At a recent stop in tiny Madison, Va., Mr. Allen showed up in black suit pants, a white shirt and a blue striped tie, without a jacket -- standard campaign wear, except for his cowboy boots. Talk among the 30 or so Republicans gathered in the grassy town park revolved around arch-conservative favorites like insisting that Mr. Obama is Muslim, the president's supposedly forged birth certificate, even black helicopters taking off from the Federal Emergency Management Agency base nearby.
When Mr. Allen opened the gathering to questions, the first came from Anne Farmer, 75, a bed-and-breakfast owner who asked, ''Would you tolerate the U.N. and their mandates?''
At first, Mr. Allen looked as if he would take the bait, speaking gamely about preserving the nation's sovereignty and mentioning Agenda 21, a United Nations sustainable development plan that some conservatives fear has morphed into a global land use agenda for their hometowns.
But then he caught himself: ''The Democrat nominee, Tim Kaine, will not be able to win with just Democrats. We are not going to be able to win with just Republicans. We need to welcome people, independents, and even sound-thinking Democrats to our side,'' he said, adding in almost a plea, ''It's important that we get all the wings of our party flapping in the same direction.''
New Dominion: Articles in this series will examine the United States Senate race in Virginia and its implications for the presidential election and control of the Senate.

HEADLINE: Crucial to Romney, Florida's Latino Voters Are Wary of Him, Too

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
CORRECTION APPENDED
KISSIMMEE, Fla. -- If Mitt Romney is to overcome his problem with Hispanic voters, he is going to have to start by changing a lot of minds in central Florida.
A key battleground in a vital swing state, the region is home to growing numbers of non-Cuban Hispanics who have always been viewed by Republicans as open to their economic and social views but reluctant to back the party in part because of its position on illegal immigration. With Mr. Romney having taken hawkish stances on immigration during the primary season, he and his campaign are now trying to shift the debate to what they feel will be friendlier terrain -- jobs.
But the challenge here in central Florida is clear. Gladys Thayer, a native of Panama who is a registered Republican, is receptive to Mr. Romney's message on the economy but did not like his tough immigration talk.
''I definitely think he needs to lean more towards helping the Hispanic community,'' said Ms. Thayer, a real estate agent, who has not decided if she will vote for Mr. Romney in November. 
Mr. Romney acknowledged his problem when he told donors in Florida recently that if President Obama keeps his commanding advantage among Latinos, it ''spells doom for us.'' He campaigned this week with Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a Cuban-American, and signaled on Monday that he may be open to compromise on the Dream Act, a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children.
But whether Mr. Romney can make real inroads among Hispanic voters here and in other swing states remains an open question. Although Cuban-Americans in South Florida favored the Republican candidate, John McCain, in 2008, President Obama won 57 percent of Hispanic votes in the state thanks to Puerto Ricans and immigrants from Latin America. ''The question is, can the Republicans change that?'' said Dario V. Moreno, a political scientist at Florida International University. ''If they perform as they did four years ago, they will lose Florida.''
Much of the fight will be waged in and around Orlando, a region where population growth led to the creation of a new Congressional district for 2012 in which Hispanics, many of Puerto Rican heritage, are 41 percent of the voting-age population.
The new district is centered here in Kissimmee, the seat of Osceola County. Hispanics registered as Democrats outnumber Republicans by 35 percentage points, but many votes are considered up for grabs: Mr. Rubio, the Republican and Tea Party favorite, carried the district in 2010. It is no coincidence that the Republican National Committee's director of Hispanic outreach for Florida, Pablo Pantoja, who was named last week, is based in nearby Orlando.
''Hispanics in the area are going to realize the Republican Party is where they belong,'' said Mr. Pantoja.
The wave of Puerto Rican migration here began in the 1970s; the newcomers were attracted by good schools and houses sometimes marketed with a trip from Puerto Rico to Disney World. The Republican economic message has had a natural resonance with some of these transplants.
''I came to the United States during the Ronald Reagan years when I was 14,'' said John Quinones, an Osceola County commissioner, who is running as a Republican for Congress in the new Ninth District. ''I was very much influenced by his philosophy. If you work hard and play by the rules, you can get ahead in life.''
As Mr. Romney courts these voters, Mr. Rubio, a potential vice-presidential choice, could help bolster his appeal in Florida and other swing states like Colorado and Nevada. Last week, Mr. Rubio urged Mr. Romney and Republicans to compromise on the Dream Act, which would give legal residency status to illegal immigrants in college who grew up in the United States.
In the Republican debates, Mr. Romney had fiercely attacked a Texas Dream Act that allowed some undocumented students to pay in-state college tuition, calling it a ''magnet,'' and he alarmed Hispanic leaders with talk of ''self-deportation,'' which would induce illegal immigrants to leave voluntarily by making life more difficult through tougher enforcement measures.
Even as Mr. Romney now weighs moderating his immigration stances, his main approach is to appeal to Hispanic voters by pinning the blame for their economic woes on the failure of the president's policies.
''President Obama Isn't Working for Hispanics'' was the headline of a campaign broadside last week. It cited figures showing that the Hispanic unemployment rate is 2 points higher than the national average, and that Hispanic households lost 66 percent of their net worth in the recession.
But the problem for Mr. Romney is that though Hispanics are suffering disproportionately, polls show that they are not blaming Mr. Obama.
''When they say the economy is bad, yes, Latinos believe that, but they think it's bad because of the Bush tax cuts,'' said Matt Baretto, a political scientist at the University of Washington who surveys Hispanic voters.
Mr. Obama retained the support of 67 percent of registered Latino voters in a nationwide telephone poll released last week by the Pew Research Center, the same historically high figure he achieved in the 2008 election, according to the exit poll conducted by Edison Research.
Mr. Romney, who is well behind the president's campaign in grass-roots organizing, plans to bring on national Hispanic policy and media coordinators soon.
The Obama re-election team, in a call with reporters last week, rebutted Republican claims of Hispanic hardship by asserting that 1.2 million new jobs have gone to Latinos under the president and 9 million Hispanics would acquire health insurance under his health care law.
Mr. Romney does have his backers here. Last Saturday in Kissimmee, over breakfast at the Taqueria Tres Amigos, Raymond Millan said he would vote for Mr. Romney over President Obama.
''Even though both have good points, I have the tendency to lean toward the Republican,'' said Mr. Millan, the director of operations for a regional courier company. He said that when he was growing up in Puerto Rico, his family favored Republicans, and ''I decided I should remain'' faithful.
But support for Mr. Obama runs deep. Lissette Martinez, who was getting a manicure-pedicure at a strip mall, said she and her husband, Jason, a county employee, were rescued by a government loan modification program that kept their house out of foreclosure.
''They put us on a payment plan'' pegged to their monthly income, she said, ''and that's really helped us.''
The mortgage program, subsidized by government payments to lenders, has had many troubles since its introduction in 2009, but Ms. Martinez expressed gratitude to the president.
''It's going to take some time for him to undo what was previously done,'' she said. ''But he's been doing everything he said he would do.''

HEADLINE: Energy Meeting Hopes to Bring Light to Millions of Homes

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Ministers from 22 countries and the E.U. hope to develop modern lighting for two million Indians by the end of 2015. 

 BODY:
"Their work is not sexy and generates little controversy or media coverage," but a group of energy and environment ministers from 22 countries and the European Union is claiming "substantial progress in spreading energy efficiency and more affordable energy around the globe," John M. Broder writes in Green blog of The New York Times. 
The third session of the so-called Clean Energy Ministerial concluded on Thursday in London with "agreements to share technology on energy-efficient appliances, to map the potential for solar and wind energy, to finance a competition to develop low-energy flat-screen televisions and to bring modern lighting to two million people in India by the end of 2015," Mr. Broder writes. 
The ministerial group, which is coordinating its efforts with the Sustainable Energy for All initiative of the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, has shorter-term goals, including eliminating the need to build 650 power plants, accelerating the spread of clean energy technology and providing energy access to more than 10 million people who today lack electricity. The nations in the ministerial group, which include the United States, Russia, China and India, produce roughly 80 percent of the world's greenhouse gases.
India will be the host for next year's session, Mr. Broder writes.
