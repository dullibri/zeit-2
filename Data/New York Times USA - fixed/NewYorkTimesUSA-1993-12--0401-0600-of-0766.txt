HEADLINE: Map of All Chromosomes To Guide Genetic Hunters

BYLINE: By NATALIE ANGIER

 BODY:
Scientists have roughed out the first comprehensive map of all human chromosomes, a feat considered one of the high hurdles of the ambitious and expensive international effort to parse the complete genetic blueprint for a human being.
The map should sharply accelerate scientists' efforts to isolate the 100,000 genes that make up human DNA, to track down mutations that result in disease, to trace the evolution of humanity as recorded by subtle runes inscribed in the genes and to solve other grand puzzles of biology. Those efforts are all part of the Human Genome Project, a 15-year program now under way at dozens of laboratories in the United States and abroad.
 
Flaws Are Conceded
 The new map, called a physical map, is still preliminary, and the researchers who generated it concede that it has many flaws. Nevertheless, the effort is considered a significant stride forward. Although scientists have been analyzing the chromosomes in piecemeal fashion for years, the map is the first effort to give an overview of the 23 pairs of chromosomes.
 
Yeast Cells and Lists
 "It's not perfect, and I don't want anybody to think I'm saying it's perfect," said Dr. Daniel Cohen, a molecular biologist at the Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humain in Paris who helped devise the map. "As with all maps, it needs to be refined. "But best is an enemy of good, and good things, even if they're imperfect, are very useful." 
 Dr. Cohen, who called the physical map "an important milestone," headed a team of French scientists reporting on their generation of the map today in the journal Nature.
"I think it's kind of great," said Dr. Kathleen Gardiner, a molecular biologist at the Eleanor Roosevelt Institute in Denver who has worked on mapping several human chromosomes. "There are a lot of resources here that will be useful to a large number of investigators."
The new compilation does not resemble a standard map. It consists of two elements: large collections of yeast cells growing on laboratory dishes, each cell enfolding a particular segment of a human chromosome, and lists of 2,000 genetic markers, precise descriptions of biochemical patterns found on the different chromosomal chunks.
The markers serve as road signs, giving sense and direction to the otherwise inscrutable monotony of human DNA. They indicate how the segments would be aligned in the heart of the human cell, and they spell out the distance between road signs.
Dr. Cohen said he would give out information about the markers over electronic mail to any interested scientist. Researchers can also call one of 10 central laboratories in the United States, or others overseas, to request any of the 33,000 chromosomal segments, or clones, which will be sent in test tubes and kept fresh on dry ice.
"You can call and say, 'I need this and this clone,' and you'll get it in two days," he said. Each clone harbors about a million bases, or chemical subunits of DNA, a stretch that may represent hundreds of individual genes.
With clones and markers in hand, researchers can cut their search for individual genes by months or years, Dr. Cohen said.
Confirming the utility of the map, Dr. Gardiner said after reading the new report that she was planning to contact Dr. Cohen immediately to get marker information about a particular region of chromosome 3, where a gene linked to leukemia is thought to lie.
 
Making Life Easier
 Dr. Francis S. Collins, director of the National Center for Human Genome Research in Bethesda, Md., who leads the American part of the genome effort, said of the map, "If it's as good as it appears to be, it will certainly make the life of the gene hunter easier than it used to be."
But, lest anybody on Congressional budget committees or elsewhere think the mapping effort of the genome project is done, he added, "This is not the end, but the beginning, or maybe the middle point."
Comparing the struggle to make a complete physical map of the chromosomes to the effort to build a national highway system, Dr. Collins said: "What we have now is the road system of about 1850. You can get from one place to another but you may find it pretty hard slogging sometimes, and on occasion you may have to get out of your wagon and walk."
Dr. Maynard V. Olson, a professor of molecular biotechnology at the University of Washington in Seattle who helped invent the yeast-based technology that the French team relied on for their mapping, said: "One thing I like about Daniel's go-for-broke attitude is that it will encourage more of the same. I think this sort of attitude will be required to move on to more detailed maps."
 
Mapping a Slippery Target
 Scientists emphasize that the new map by no means guarantees that every quest for human genes will be smooth. Indeed, some argued that having a physical map is only a small part of the difficulty of isolating genes. They said that for years scientists had an excellent physical map of the region of chromosome 17 thought to harbor an important breast cancer gene, but that six major laboratories were still struggling to home in on the gene itself.
However, the breast cancer gene is thought to be an unusually slippery target. For the capture of most genes, Dr. Olson predicted, the map will prove very useful. He also said small and less amply endowed laboratories would probably benefit more from the new report than would large scientific groups able to whip up their own cloned segments within a matter of weeks.
Using the same highway analogy that Dr. Collins used, he said: "An interstate highway stimulates economic activity tremendously by making it possible for small businesses to move goods without having to own a railroad at the same time. Having a biological infrastructure like a physical map makes it possible for smaller and more diverse labs to tackle the isolation of important genes."
Beyond creating maps and identifying genes, scientists in the genome business hope soon to begin spelling out, or sequencing, all three billion chemical letters that make up human DNA. That task, the most daunting element of the genome project, is not likely to be completed before the turn of the century.

HEADLINE: Rebuking Aide, U.S. Says Haiti Policy Stands

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
Rebuking its top human rights official, the Clinton Administration said today that it had no intention of changing its policy of returning Haitian boat people without granting them a chance to seek political asylum.
"There is no change in Administration policy on that question," Michael McCurry, the State Department spokesman, said today. 
 State Department and White House officials reportedly were incensed by the comments by John Shattuck, Assistant Secretary for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs, who suggested on Tuesday that the Administration's policy on Haitian boat people should be re-evaluated. The policy has drawn sharp criticism from human rights groups, which say it violates international treaties on the handling of refugees.
On a visit to Haiti, Mr. Shattuck told reporters that he was returning to Washington "with a view that a policy review is necessary."
But White House and State Department officials were quick to say that Mr. Shattuck's comments did not reflect Administration thinking, and that Mr. Shattuck was given a stern dressing down this morning by Peter Tarnoff, the Under Secretary for Political Affairs and the second highest ranking official in the State Department.
"It was completely wrong and outrageous and there is enormous anger in the White House and the State Department about his alleged statement," said one State Department official, who spoke on the condition that he not be identified. "That is not the policy. There will be no review. It was a completely rogue statement."
Mr. Shattuck has told State Department officials that the article misquoted him, but according to several State Department officials who asked not to be quoted by name, "nobody believes that." In private conversations with friends, Mr. Shattuck and other Administration officials have expressed disquiet over the policy, which has remained in place for nearly a year even though there has been no discernable progress in restoring democracy to Haiti.
Mr. Shattuck did not return telephone calls seeking his comments today.
The confusion over American policy toward Haitian boat people comes at a time when the number of people trying to flee the beleaguered country is rising sharply. Since the country's military leaders refused to allow the return of the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, as scheduled on Oct. 30 and since the imposition of an economic blockade by the United Nations, the number of Haitians applying for asylum at the three American processing centers in Haiti has risen sharply.
The Coast Guard reported today that it had so far picked up 220 Haitians trying to flee the island in boats in December. That is a large jump from the 60 caught at sea in November. But it remains a long way from the 1,363 Haitians who were picked up last January, before Mr. Clinton reversed a campaign pledge and directed the Coast Guard to pick up and forcibly return Haitians trying to escape the political repression and economic chaos in their country.
The reiteration of the President's policy regarding Haitian refugees came as Robert Malval, the Prime Minister appointed by Father Aristide, said that because of a lack of support he was canceling a new round of talks among representatives of a cross section of Haitian society aimed at resolving the country's political crisis.
Administration officials said that at a meeting in Paris on Monday, Mr. Malval told envoys from the United States, France, Canada and Venezuela that Father Aristide had withdrawn his support for the talks. Representatives of the four countries are scheduled to meet next week with Father Aristide in an attempt to persuade him to back the Malval-initiated talks, one official said.
Mr. Malval's resignation as Prime Minister technically becomes effective today. But he has said he will remain in office until a successor is named and ratified by the Haitian Parliament.

HEADLINE: Makers of Anti-Personnel Mines Are Urged by U.S. to Ban Exports

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 15

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration has asked more than 40 countries that produce land mines to ban exports of anti-personnel mines for three to five years, senior American officials said today.
The Administration, which wrote to the governments on Dec. 7, has also told them that it wants a new agreement to stop the spread of mines. The accord would be based on an existing agreement, the Missile Technology Control Regime, intended to limit the spread of missile technology. 
 Congress has agreed to extend a one-year ban on United States mine exports for three years, and the United Nations General Assembly is expected to give unanimous support to a nonbinding resolution calling for a global moratorium on such exports.
There are already 80 million to 100 million land mines sown around the world.
 
The Main Sources
 The General Assembly has already adopted a European-sponsored resolution calling on all aid and development agencies to include mine-clearing in their work and asking the Secretary General to consider a fund to finance such work.
The countries the Administration is pressing for a moratorium include China, Italy and the former Soviet republics, which some officials say are probably the biggest mine exporters, as well as Brazil, Argentina, North and South Korea and the East European countries.
United States officials have set an initial goal of ending trade in anti-personnel mines rather than anti-tank and ship mines in order to ease resistance from some defense ministries and arms makers.
But they also argue that the inexpensive devices, which are hard to detect, are often scattered indiscriminately in areas where they become a major threat to civilians, complicating the task of furnishing aid to war victims and hindering the return of refugees.
 
A Dangerous Randomness
 According to a State Department report last summer, the use of mines has changed in recent decades in ways that make them a major threat to civilians.
In contrast with World War II, when both sides laid "rigorously mapped minfields," the report said: "Mines are now generally laid without maps in areas designed to protect economic targets or to instill fear in opposition soldiers and civilians. Unfortunately, in this terror style of mine warfare, it is the civilians who suffer the most."
Afghanistan remains the most heavily mined country, with 9 million to 10 million mines -- and possibly as many as 35 million -- unaccounted for. Between 5 million and 10 million mines are thought to be planted in Angola, a similar number in Iraq, and four million to seven million in Cambodia, or one for every two inhabitants.
Cambodia's 12-year-old civil war is thought to be the first in which more people have been killed by mines than by any other weapon. This has left Cambodia with the world's highest percentage of disabled people: one Cambodian out of every 236 has lost a limb.
Mozambique, Somalia, Western Sahara and Bosnia and Herzegovina are each thought to have one million to two million mines, the report said.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD TRADE AGREEMENT: The Negotiators;
Odd Couple Bring a World Trade Accord Home

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, Dec. 15

 BODY:
One is portly, one is slim. One is subtle, the other blunt. One is a committed free trader and a one-time protege of Margaret Thatcher; the other is a Los Angeles lawyer, willing to argue almost any position, who started in politics as an advocate of the dispossessed.
But to an extraordinary extent, today's global trade pact is the product of the unusual friendship between Sir Leon Brittan, the Englishman who represented the European Community, and Mickey Kantor, who represented the United States.
 
Frosty at First
 When they met 10 months ago, their relationship was frosty. That is not surprising, since one is the product of Cambridge University and Britain's traditionally aristocratic Tory Party and the other, folksier in style, started life in America's country-music capital, Nashville, and made his name as a wheeling-and-dealing entertainment lawyer. 
 Sir Leon delights in the rituals and perquisites of international negotiations. Mr. Kantor often travels tieless across the Atlantic in tourist class, lugging a bag over his shoulder.
Months of close work, however, have turned suspicion to trust, they and their aides say. The two men abandoned the usual practice of holding meetings with legions of assistants. Instead, they would meet with one another for hours at a time, relying heavily on their memories instead of their aides. Their confidence in each other grew and in time, they began to compare notes about the political and lobbying pressures they faced at home, finding they had more in common than they realized.
In the end, they could seal with handshakes a succession of trillion-dollar trade deals.
"I found we could do a lot just one-on-one -- there were things said in private, just to each other, that really helped, particularly in difficult moments," Mr. Kantor said here today.
For his part, Sir Leon learned to face Mr. Kantor's table-thumping negotiating style with equanimity.
"I would just quietly say, 'Look, where is this going to get us,' and he changed," Sir Leon said in a telephone interview tonight from his home in Brussels. "I know various American styles," Sir Leon, who also studied at Yale University, said. "It doesn't faze me."
Aides say the friendship between Sir Leon and Mr. Kantor eased the tension of negotiating sessions that ran as long as 22 hours, and made a real difference in enabling compromises on several occasions.
Early Tuesday morning, for instance, Sir Leon had to decide whether to yield to American insistence that the issue of greater access to Europe for American films and TV programs should be dropped from the agreement. Such a step would preserve the United States' ability to impose trade penalties against Europe, particularly the French.
Sir Leon pondered the issue as he stared out of his limousine after leaving the American trade mission's conference room. Finally, according to an aide in the car, Sir Leon slapped his thighs with both hands and said "Yes" aloud to himself, realizing that he knew Mr. Kantor well enough to recognize that further discussion would be hopeless.
"He knew he had reached the American bottom line," the aide said.
 
Ardent Free Trader
 Sir Leon, who is 54, was a protege of former Prime Minister Thatcher of Britain until his free-trade instincts led him to support a politically unpopular plan for the British Government to buy helicopters from an American, not British, manufacturer. As the European Community's commissioner for industrial competition policies in the late 1980's, he enraged the French by challenging their subsidies to state-run industries as unprincipled meddling with market forces.
By contrast, Mr. Kantor, who is also 54, is contemptuous of economic ideologies, and has less worldly interests. He has preferred to vacation in Hawaii and had never even been to Asia before taking the trade job.

HEADLINE: U.S. Proposes to Divert Fresh Water To Restore Damaged California Delta

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 15

 BODY:
In a concerted action without parallel, four Federal agencies moved today to reverse the long-term environmental destruction of San Francisco Bay and the Sacramento Delta, the vast estuary that is the lifeblood of California.
The agencies, which rarely cooperate, entered one of the most politically charged issues in California by proposing new water quality standards for the estuary. If adopted, they would require that substantial amounts of fresh water be diverted away from cities and farms, particularly in dry years. 
 By stepping in under the authority of the Federal Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act, the agencies are trying to resolve what had become an intractable environmental problem. Fifteen years of political paralysis have brought several fish species to the brink of extinction in the Sacramento Delta and have threatened the quality of drinking water as increasingly larger amounts of water have been siphoned off to slake the thirst of farms and fast-growing cities.
 
Vital Agricultural Area
 The delta harbors more than 120 species of fish and is the source of drinking water for 20 million people. It also irrigates 200 different crops, including 45 percent of the nation's fruits and vegetables.
The environmental damage is caused by saline water from the Pacific Ocean that backs up through the 1,600-square-mile estuary, which extends east from San Francisco Bay nearly to Sacramento.
Fresh water that would hold back the salt water is carried by aqueducts hundreds of miles south to Los Angeles and other cities, and to farms in the Central Valley, the state's main agricultural area that extends for more than 400 miles between the Sierra Nevada and Coast Ranges. The delta provides two-thirds of all the water used in California.
The big question now is whether the state will cooperate and help shape and carry out the new rules, or continue to fight and let the Federal agencies and courts impose a solution.
While Federal action has been pending for years, Clinton Administration officials compelled the disparate agencies to cooperate to minimize the economic impact of the action, saying they could reduce the amount of water needed in the delta by using it to meet several different environmental objectives at the same time.
And the officials extended a conciliatory hand to Gov. Pete Wilson of California, a Republican who last April scuttled years of state efforts to rescue the delta on the ground that planning was impossible because of the threat of fragmented Federal action under different laws.
"This is an unprecedented proposal by four Federal agencies to work with the state to end the gridlock in water policy in California," said Felicia Marcus, the regional administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, adding that the Government was open to modifying today's proposal.
The proposal, which goes into effect after a 90-day period for public comment, would set minimum salinity standards for Suisun Bay, a crucial fish hatchery area northeast of San Francisco, and reduce salinity elsewhere to protect migrating Chinook salmon and the spawning areas of striped bass.
As part of the plan, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service proposed to designate the Sacramento splittail, a 12-inch fish of the minnow family, as threatened and changed the status of the winter-run Chinook salmon on the Sacramento River from threatened to endangered, a more serious designation. It also reaffirmed its designation of the Delta smelt as threatened.
 
Additional Fresh Water
 The Government estimated that the rules would require an average of 500,000 acre feet of additional fresh water in the delta a year, and as much as 1.1 million during extended droughts. On average, this is about 7 percent of the water drawn from the delta. An acre foot is about 326,000 gallons, or enough water for two typical households for a year.
Farm interests were dubious, saying the plan would require considerably more water.
Pressure on the delta has eased in the last year with the end of a six-year drought in the Far West. Even so, only 40 percent of the delta's historic water flow remains, and the salinity has threatened not only fish and the commercial fishing industry, but also local drinking water supplies.
San Francisco gets its water from the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir in Yosemite National Park, and is not directly dependent on water from the delta, but most of its suburbs gets its water from the delta.
After the state killed its plan last April, 16 environmental groups sued the E.P.A. for failing to enforce the Clean Water Act. Under a settlement negotiated by the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, the Government agreed to issue proposed rules by today.
 
Reaction Is MixedOther Agencies Listed
 The other Federal agencies are the Fish and Wildlife Service, the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Bureau of Reclamation, which operates the Central Valley Project, the largest irrigation project in the state.
Reaction to the action was predictably mixed.
Environmentalists hailed it as a milestone. "The Federal Government said today that the environment can no longer be ignored," said David Behar, executive director of the Bay Institute of San Francisco, an advocacy group. "The key question is will the state now get off the dime and work toward a solution that meets both environmental and water supply needs."
In a statement, Governor Wilson criticized the standards but also offered to negotiate with the Administration. He said the standards would "thoughtlessly cost California jobs," and accused the Federal agencies of grossly underestimating how much water would be needed to meet the standards. But he said he hoped to reach an agreement that would reconcile "the economic and environmental dependencies on the bay-delta."
For many farmers, the action today was viewed as yet another blow after years of water cutbacks. This year, 90,000 acres remained fallow because of water diverted for environmental reasons.
 
Delta Issue Unites Cities
 "There have been several foreclosures this year, and they are primarily tied to water issues," said Don Upton, a spokesman for the Westlands Water District in the Central Valley.
Urban interests were more equivocal. The delta issue has, for the first time, united cities in Northern and Southern California, long divided over water. The state's largest district is the Metropolitan Water District of Southern California, which depends on the delta for 30 percent of the water that is supplied to 16 million people.
Duane L. Georgeson, assistant general manager of the district, said the proposal was a source of "serious concern" over the amount of water that might be lost. But he said he had been given assurances by Elizabeth Rieke, Assistant Secretary of the Interior, that the Clinton Administration was open to compromises to reduce the economic impact.
The Federal action came two days after another major milestone in California's water wars. After years of controversy and litigation, the City of Los Angeles agreed to reduce the amount of water it takes from streams feeding Mono Lake, which provides an important habitat for migrating birds and which has suffered extreme environmental damage after eight decades of pumping by Los Angeles, 400 miles to the south.

HEADLINE: WHITE HOUSE SPLIT OVER BUDGET CUTS

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
Working against a Christmas eve deadline, members of President Clinton's Cabinet have begun lobbying in earnest for relief from the tight spending ceilings that are forcing many to slash their 1995 budget requests.
Most Cabinet secretaries are keeping their complaints relatively quiet to maintain an illusion of solidarity within the President's top ranks. But the fissures are widening as senior Administration officials find themselves feuding with each over policy and politics while the White House prepares its budget proposal for the 1995 fiscal year, which begins next October. The plan will be submitted to Congress in February. 
 Defense Secretary Les Aspin, who announced today that he was resigning after a year on the job, broke ranks last week when he made public his displeasure over the White House plan to leave the Pentagon $40 billion to $50 billion short of what the military contends is needed to sustain the forces Mr. Clinton wants.
And Secretary of State Warren Christopher has sounded similar alarms, signaling frantically that the State Department cannot hope to meet its post-cold war peacekeeping responsibilities while complying with the Office of Management and Budget's recommendation that its budget be sliced significantly.
 
Little Hope of Help
 The pressure is at least as intense on the domestic side of the budget equation, where the bulk of Mr. Clinton's new policy initiatives fall. The President has been meeting with his agency heads almost every day since Thanksgiving to listen to their pleadings. But with the aid of the fierce and unyielding front supplied by his economic advisers, he has offered little hope of additional help.
The President's budget recommendations will not be made public until next month, and Mr. Clinton is expected to consider recommendations from his advisers over the Christmas holiday break.
"He's not there to evenly divide his priorities among 14 children," an adviser said. "He's there to lead the country."
The fights that have erupted over the budget within the Administration arise from the passage of last year's budget plan, which freezes discretionary spending at about $550 billion and does not even allow increases in inflation.
Discretionary spending is the money allocated to all programs for which the money must be approved each year by Congress. Many benefits programs, such as welfare and Medicare are financed over multiple years.
"There's tons of wrestling going on," said one adviser to the President.
 
Meetings With Secretaries
 Mr. Clinton has made a point to meet with each of his Cabinet secretaries personally to hold what one White House aide called "real earnest discussions." The President often finds himself confronting old friends like Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich, Education Secretary Richard W. Riley and Health Secretary Donna E. Shalala.
As each Cabinet secretary has trooped into the West Wing Cabinet Room, he or she has been greeted not only by the generally cordial President, but also by the unsmiling aides whose job it is to prevent Mr. Clinton from yielding to his natural tendency to compromise.
These advisers include the budget director, Leon E. Panetta, and Robert E. Rubin, the chairman of the National Economic Council, who remind the President of his budget limitations, and senior advisers George Stephanopoulos and David R. Gergen, who remind the President of his political limitations.
"It is difficult in terms of balancing what our commitments have been in terms of investments, against the Administration's larger objective in terms of deficit reduction," a Transportation Department official said. "People here believe the best thing to do for the economy is stick to deficit reduction goals. Everybody believes that in the abstract."
But the abstract has run up hard against the reality of Mr. Clinton's policy goals. The Department of Labor is pleading for money to pay for job training programs. The Department of Health and Human Services, the Government's largest agency, is hoping to avoid cutting full-time employees so it can staff new Administration commitments to alter the welfare and health care systems and improve the Head Start preschool program. And the Department of Housing and Urban Development is holding the President to a promise to provide additional financing to fight homelessness.
 
Possibility of Layoffs
 Because of its budget dilemma, the Clinton Administration has found itself, in essence, at war with itself. And the proposed cuts could run far deeper than merely delaying the start of new programs. At the Department of Health and Human Services, the cuts could result in layoffs.
Most agency officials are cautious about complaining too loudly about their plight, mostly because they do not know what their colleagues in other Cabinet departments might be up to. Lacking a clear view of the bottom line, they hesitate to handicap their chances without knowing what others might be accomplishing. One Cabinet official called it a "prisoners' dilemma."

HEADLINE: MILITARY MARRIAGE SEEN AS NO THREAT

BYLINE: By ERIC SCHMITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
An exhaustive high-level Pentagon report ordered last summer by Defense Secretary Les Aspin after the Marine Corps tried to ban married recruits has reached this conclusion: marriage is not a threat to national security.
Since August, scores of generals and admirals and their top aides have been poring over reams of reports on military pay, housing, child care and demographics to determine whether married recruits hurt combat readiness and, in general, are bad risks for the armed forces. 
 What they have found, according to a confidential summary of the 600-page report, cries out for an explanation of why it took four months to divine this piece of common wisdom: military life is hard on marriages, but most couples make it work.
As one general involved in the review muttered, "This was like hitting a gnat with a sledgehammer."
 
No Surprises
 Another military officer who has been briefed about the study said, "If you're looking for a big, front-page story out of this, you're going to be disappointed."
To be sure, the study did find that the military needs to spruce up the barracks that single soldiers live in, and to improve family and financial counseling for young troops, many of whom enter the armed services at age 17 or 18.
Senior Pentagon officials are putting the finishing touches on the report and its recommendations, which Mr. Aspin, who announced today that he would retire, is expected to announce with great fanfare next week.
To be or not to be married became an issue in August when Gen. Carl E. Mundy Jr., the Marine Corps commandant approved a new policy that would phase out enlistments of married men and women beginning this year.
Marine officials expressed concern that many young married recruits failed to re-enlist after long tours away from home. These young recruits also had higher divorce rates than older married marines, the officials said. There would have been no restrictions on marriage once recruits joined the service.
 
Storm of Criticism
 The policy drew a storm of criticism, largely because neither President Clinton nor Mr. Aspin had been made aware of the plan. Mr. Aspin immediately canceled General Mundy's policy and ordered the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness, Edwin Dorn, to carry out a militarywide study.
Four panels were created to study military pay, housing, demographics, family support programs and the impact on combat readiness that young married recruits would have.
Pentagon officials said much of the information had been compiled in independent studies and merely had to be collected and analyzed. Military and civilian Pentagon officials also conducted scores of interviews to gather new information.
Under the direction of Nicolia Timenes, the Pentagon's principal director for military manpower and personnel policy, and aided by several senior generals and admirals, the team of experts produced a report that contradicted the Marines' premise.
 
Premise Doesn't Stand
 "The presumption was that getting married early was a problem, but that's not what they found," said another Defense Department official. "What they found are that the problems are more financial."
Specifically, the report found "no direct, clear, meaningful and statistically valid relationship (positive or negative) between marital status and readiness."
In addition, the report also concluded that "trying to become a warrior, spouse and perhaps a parent simultaneously is a real challenge; most meet it, but it's tough."
A third finding was that the military "can do a better job of helping our junior members, both married and single, meet the challenge."
General Mundy and other military commanders have worried about economic incentives in the services for young troops to marry. In the Marines, for example, officers say a substantial number of 17- and 18-year-old enlisted troops to have wives who are as young as 14 or 15.
The report found that younger women and men in general who are in the military were more likely to marry than their civilian peers.
Among the recommendations Mr. Aspin is expected to embrace are several that do not cost anything. The reports recommendations include financial and family counseling, a review of barracks policy to allow more younger families to live on base, and generally, improved family-support.
 
Some Costly Options
 The report also suggested several options that would require an estimated $200 million to $300 million. One would be to increase the housing allowance given to military personnel who live off-base. Another increase could come in cost-of-living pay.
Some senior Defense Department officials questioned spending more money on a problem that apparently was not as serious as officials initially thought.
The report conclusions applied broadly to all four armed services, but it did note the particular problem facing the Marine Corps, which is the smallest of the services but whose forces spend increasingly more time overseas.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD TRADE AGREEMENT: The Turning Point;
A Call From Clinton, and Then a Deal

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, Dec. 15

 BODY:
It was early dawn on the day before the deadline for a world trade agreement when, after another night of fruitless haggling with European officials over trade in movies, the United States trade representative, Mickey Kantor, called President Clinton.
"As in any negotiation, every tough issue had been reserved until last," Mr. Kantor recalled in an interview today. "I gave the President my advice on the movie issue, based on the last European offer; the President thought about it a while and called me back. The answer was firm -- we could not buy into something that compromised on free expression." 
 If the seven-year-old negotiations surrounding the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, completed today, had a single turning point, this was perhaps it. President Clinton's decision effectively insured that a GATT deal would be done, but would not include the contentious issue involving movies, television and musical recordings.
Mr. Kantor then talked with Samuel Berger, the United States deputy national security adviser, and then invited a weary Sir Leon Brittan, the top trade negotiator for the European Community, into a private room. "I told him the answer is no," Mr. Kantor said in his hoarse voice. "We're walking away from the table."
 
'Our Position Would Not Change'
 "Sir Leon asked me if I was sure," Mr. Kantor said today, "and I said that our position would not change. Then he asked, 'You mean you're going to let the French win?' I said that in the end, it's the French people who are going to lose."
Mr. Kantor's decisive conversation with the President underlined a pattern repeated during the negotiations.
In Brussels a week earlier, when the two sides had again negotiated through the night and seemed on the verge of a comprehensive accord that included the movie issue, it was the President who had decided that the proposal was unacceptable, Mr. Kantor said.
"The President told me about how far I could go, and then left me a great deal of room," Mr. Kantor said as he drove to the Geneva airport, clutching a gift-wrapped present for his daughter. "He showed a lot of trust and I am grateful for that. But the last decisions were his. He knows this GATT deal backwards and forwards."
The last European offer on access in Europe for American films and fast-emerging technologies like cable and pay-per-view had been limited, Mr. Kantor said, falling short of an American compromise proposal involving the lifting of Europe's quotas on American programming shown in prime time. The American plan also involved channeling a portion of the tax revenue collected by France on United States films to American entertainment companies on the condition that the money would be reinvested in Europe.
Mr. Kantor said Sir Leon offered a binding European commitment that the quota on American-made programs on television, now limited to 49 percent of broadcasts, would not be made more severe and would be applied equally to services like video-on-demand.
Sir Leon also offered to negotiate a change in the French levies on box-office tickets and blank audio and video cassettes "as soon as possible," Mr. Kantor said, but without committing to a deadline. Sir Leon could not be reached for comment.
The United States objects to the French levies because nearly 60 percent of the French box-office taxes on foreign films come from American movies and many of the cassettes are used to record American music or films. But all the money raised goes to subsidizing the French cinema.
 
A Question of Fairness
 "We felt very strongly on the philosophical issue," Mr. Kantor said. "This was an economic question, sure, but it was also about free expression and fairness. U.S. artists are being denied their financial rights, which is incomprehensible. Also, what the Europeans refer to as 'culture' was being invoked as a means to deny free speech."
Mr. Kantor said he had argued the fairness question several times with Sir Leon in recent weeks before giving up. Then they tried to find a formula to settle each side's demands and came close several times. "But," he added, "you're not negotiating with a United States of Europe. You're negotiating with 12 nation states, and that was complicated."
After President Clinton rejected Europe's offer on film, other issues were settled quickly.
Within four hours, and after quick showers, Mr. Kantor and Sir Leon were ready to announce to the world that they had reached "comprehensive agreement."
In fact, of course, it was much less than that. But Mr. Kantor said he was "elated" by the result. "There is now a seamless web between domestic and foreign economic issues," he added. "The President understands this and has therefore put trade and international economics to the fore, as a means to reinforce our national security."

HEADLINE: Industrial Production Rises 0.9%

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
The nation's factories and mines posted their biggest gain in output in a year during November, driven by a sharp upswing in auto production, the Government said today.
The Federal Reserve Board's industrial production index surged nine-tenths of a percent in November -- the sixth consecutive monthly increase. It followed a gain of seven-tenths of a percent in October. Analysts said November's gain provided further evidence of robust economic growth. 
 "It basically fits with an economy that is growing rather strongly -- at a 4.9 percent rate this quarter," said Elliott Platt, director of economic research at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc.
 
Increase in Auto Industry
 About half the November gain was a result of higher production in motor vehicles and parts, which has jumped by 20 percent in the last four months. Low interest rates have encouraged consumers to replace aging cars and trucks.
But even when auto manufacturing was excluded, output expanded by a healthy five-tenths of a percent in November.
These strong gains meant that American factories were working harder and faster in November, using 83 percent of their productive capacity, the Fed said.
This pushed capacity utilization to its highest level since August 1989, when it stood at 83.2 percent. The November rate was up six-tenths of a percent from the previous month. A year earlier, the rate was at 80.8 percent in November.
Although these high levels of factory use normally flash warnings that inflationary pressures may be building, analysts say this is not a worry. With much of the global economy in a slump, price pressures in the United States are likely to remain muted, they said.
Production of business equipment, which has been one of the bright spots in the slow 33-month-long recovery, advanced 1.3 percent in November following a gain of eight-tenths of a percent in November.
Construction supplies also increased by a strong 1.1 percent in November, compared with a three-tenths of a percent gain in October.
Separately, the Commerce Department said today that business inventories were steady in October while sales rose for a third straight month, up four-tenths of a percent after a gain of half a percent in September.

HEADLINE: Planning for Desegregation: 22 Guides to Lead 11 Forums

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST HARTFORD, Conn., Dec. 10

 BODY:
It was the last day of training for the 22 people selected to help local officials and parents draft plans for integrating public schools, as a new Connecticut law requires. What, they were asked, could state officials say to help them, in introducing them to the public forums that convene next month?
"Tell them it's not our fault," someone quickly said. 
 No state has ever asked communities to write their own plans for addressing segregated schools, and no one expects it to be easy. Connecticut's new law sets no specific goals, but it does require cities and suburbs to talk to one another about racial and economic disparities. It will be the jobs of the 22 people, called facilitators, to help the 11 regional forums organize themselves and get to work.
 
Establishing Neutrality
 Amid an atmosphere of anxiety and anger so intense that state education officials have been shouted down at some public meetings, the facilitators' first challenge will be to establish their neutrality before groups likely to include reluctant, suspicious or even hostile people.
When the 11 forums convene in January, they will range in size from 22 to 58, depending on the number of communities in a region. They will include each community's chief elected official and school board chairman, plus two teachers and four parents. Each forum will be assigned two facilitators.
Facilitators, increasingly common in the corporate world, guide groups as they make decisions. Not part of the group, they aid progress by helping to plan agendas; by moderating discussion, and by clarifying issues.
 
Like a Game Show Host
 In action, moving around to draw people out, dashing to a blackboard to record suggestions, facilitators may appear to be animated leaders. But their role is much more like a game-show host, moving things along. Their goal is a meeting that is conducted fairly and efficiently and that achieves consensus.
These facilitators, selected from more than 200 applicants, include management consultants, professional facilitators, trainers and mediators, lawyers, college professors and administrators, and teachers. One once was a relief worker for Cambodian refugees in Thailand; another worked with gangs in New Haven; one is a Democratic town chairwoman. To avoid conflicts of interest, no facilitator will be assigned to the forum that dealing with his or her community.
Seventeen are women and five are men. Seventeen are white, four are black and one is Hispanic. Going through exercises that sorted them according to various categories, they discovered that more than half are first-born children.
 
A Professional Challenge
 During four days of training in a classroom here, they said they were attracted to the assignment both by the importance of the subject, and by the professional challenge that the forums would present.
"You really needed to look deep within yourself as to why you wanted to do this," said Deanne Shapiro, a management consultant from West Hartford with two children in public school. "Even though we're being paid for attending the meetings, in essence we're volunteering our time."
"I think of it as Connecticut's great adventure," she said. "I think it will shape the future of Connecticut and the country no matter how it turns out. And as a parent, I want the best education for my kids and all kids."
But the facilitators also agreed that their opinions about the integration law, and about anything else, was "their stuff," and that they should keep "their stuff" to themselves. Their role was to help the regional forums do whatever they could agree to do.
Agreeing on regional plans could be easy or hard, depending on how much a forum's members want to do, said Howard Rifkin, who as director of the Institute for Public Service at the University of Connecticut is in charge of convening the forums.
"If people come to the forums believing that they have an obligation to do something, the meetings will be very contentious and emotional," Mr. Rifkin said. "If people meet and speak platitudes for five months, they won't be."
 
Collaboration Uppermost
 Before any forum can begin debating issues of education or integration, however, its facilitators will have to help its members master a new way of doing business.
Facilitators rely on collaboration, helping a group's members see themselves as a team. But the forums will be made up of elected officials used to running things themselves, plus a handful of parents whose idea of debate might be a verbal free-for-all. Everyone will have to agree on ground rules.
Working as teams also tends to exclude the public, which will be intensely interested in the forums' progress and eager to have its say. But all meetings will be open, in a process that has as much to do with politics as with education, and so the local politicians who make up the forums will have to decide how to accommodate the public.
"The public hates this cooperative-working method because it's very hard to observe," said Michael Rion, former president of the Hartford Seminary, who is also the facilitator for the State Commission on Educational Excellence.
"Traditional meetings are terrible places to discuss and get things done, but they're perfect for the public to see everything," he said. "Work groups, by their nature, exclude observers."
At bottom, each forum's members will have to decide whether to have confidence in their facilitators, or to view them with suspicion as agents of the state with an unspoken agenda.
On their last day of training, feeling anxious themselves, the facilitators asked Mr. Rifkin and other officials what everyone wants to know: What kind of regional plan will satisfy the state?
Many kinds, they were told; to say more, the state would risk seeming to have a plan it wanted to impose. "This is very much where ambiguity takes over from clarity," Mr. Rifkin said.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD TRADE AGREEMENT: The View in Washington;
Clinton and Some in Congress See Less Trouble This Time

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
President Clinton kicked off his campaign today to get the new world trade agreement approved by Congress, saying it would foster an American export boom and that it "cements our position of leadership in the new global economy."
At a hastily called news conference at the White House, within minutes of the approval of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade accord in Geneva, Mr. Clinton said he was formally notifying Congress of his intention to sign the accord. Asked if he thought this accord would have as much trouble being approved by Congress as the North American Free Trade Agreement, Mr. Clinton responded categorically: "No." 
 Senior lawmakers said they shared Mr. Clinton's optimism. The opposition to GATT in Congress is much more balkanized: there is no clear enemy, like Mexico, for opponents to focus upon and no one has stepped forward to lead a charge against the accord, which offers much larger potential benefits for the American economy.
 
Contrast in Scale
 While the North American accord opens a market, Mexico, that represents 5 percent of American gross domestic product, GATT opens a market, 116 other countries, that is three times the American G.D.P. It opens them less deeply than the North American pact does, but much more broadly.
Nevertheless, lawmakers cautioned that it would take at least 18 months to rewrite the American trade laws as required by the agreement, to hold hearings on its contents in both the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, and to decide how to replace the roughly $10 billion in lost tariffs that will result from the treaty. They said GATT would almost certainly take until June or July 1995 to be voted upon.
"Round One is completed; it took seven years," said Lawrence O'Donnell, chief of staff of the Senate Finance Committee. "Round 2 is now beginning with the Congress." He added: "Popping the champagne is extremely premature. Our champagne is still on ice."
With an eye to the Congressional debate, Mr. Clinton took the offensive today in trying to explain to the American public why the complicated accord was a good deal.
 
Not Entirely Satisfied
 He acknowledged that it "did not accomplish everything we wanted." For example, the United States agreed to deal with the much-disputed issue of tariffs on American television programs and movies in separate negotiations.
The President said, "We must continue to fight for more open markets, for entertainment, for insurance, for banking and for other industries." And he said the export boom fostered by the agreement's tariff cuts "will create hundreds of thousands of good-paying American jobs."
He also said the agreement would discourage nations from discriminating against American businesses in such industries as computer services, construction, engineering and architecture, and would crack down on piracy of American products.
Finally, Mr. Clinton said, the pact preserves "our ability to retaliate against unfair trade practices and our right to set strong environmental and consumer protection standards for economic activity here in the United States."
 
Dissent Is Emerging
 Opposition groups are beginning to coalesce. William Farley, chairman and chief executive of Fruit of the Loom and one of the most vocal corporate opponents of the GATT accord, vowed to continue his fight against the pact in Congress. "I have already today talked to four Congressmen and three Senators and two Governors to raise the visibility of this issue to see if we can block passage of the agreement in Congress," he said.
President Clinton has until April 15 to sign the trade pact. Under an agreement with Congress, Mr. Clinton was required to notify Congress by midnight tonight that he intended to enter into the agreement. Because Mr. Clinton met that deadline, the accord will be considered under a "fast track" arrangement, in which lawmakers are barred from rewriting provisions or adding amendments. Instead, they are resticted to a simple vote of "yes" or "no," as they were with the North American Free Trade Agreement.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Municipal Prices Slip; Treasuries Up

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
A rush of new issues kept prices in the municipal bond market subdued yesterday, but helped lift Treasury prices, ending a three-day slide.
As has been the case recently, Treasury trading was light and directionless, as prices and yields remained in their recent trading ranges. 
 In the municipal market, about $2 billion in new issues were sold, according to Bloomberg Business News, led by a $756 million issue for the New York State Medical Care Facilities Finance Agency. Traders said the high volume of new issues -- more than $5 billion this week -- is keeping prices flat after a sharp rally last week.
Because many of the new municipal bonds are being used to pay off older, higher-interest rate bonds, they can help the Treasury market when trading is light. That is because the escrow funds set up to pay off the old bonds are filled with Treasury securities.
 
Economic Data Ignored
 The economic data released yesterday seemed to have little impact on traders and investors. The Federal Reserve reported that industrial production rose nine-tenths of 1 percent in November, which was a little higher than expectations on Wall Street.
But the data still were in line with what seems to be the consensus outlook for the fourth quarter: that the economy will grow at a rate around 4 percent, after adjustment for inflation. The uncertainity that is keeping the market in its trading range is about the first part of next year, and whether the growth pace will slow.
Many forecasters are predicting that growth will slow to around 3 percent and that inflation will remain moderate, around the increase of less than 3 percent now expected for 1993. If this is the case, these analysts are arguing that there should be little upward pressure on long-term interest rates.
Allen Sinai, the chief economist at Lehman Brothers, said yesterday that he expected inflation to remain below 3 percent next year and that long-term interest rates would be in the 6 percent range, little changed from where they are now.
 
Long Bond Price Up
 In late trading in the secondary market, the price of the 30-year bond due in August 2023 was up 5/32 while the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, slipped to 6.28 percent, from 6.29 percent Tuesday. The price of the two-year note was up 3/32 as the yield fell to 4.18 percent from 4.23 percent.
The Treasury announced that it would sell $17 billion of two-year notes next Tuesday and $11 billion of five-year notes Wednesday. The size of the auctions fits with expectations in the market.
In the when-issued, or pre-auction, market late yesterday, the yield on the two-year note was 4.25 percent while the yield on the five-year note was 5.20 percent.
The $756 million issue from the New York State Medical Care Facilities Financing Agency was tentatively priced to yield 5.75 percent on the bond due in 2019. That is a tax equivalent yield of 8.98 percent in the new 36 percent tax bracket. The serial bonds due in 1999 were priced to yield 4.75 percent, which is a tax equivalent yield of 7.42 percent. The lead underwriter for the deal was Morgan Stanley & Company.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Higher as Concerns Remain About Russian Vote

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar was mostly higher yesterday in light trading amid continuing concerns about the political future of Russia.
Gold prices rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for February delivery closed at $389 an ounce, up 40 cents. The Republic National Bank of New York quoted spot gold at $387 an ounce, up 25 cents. 
 The dollar did well against the Japanese yen in Tokyo and London, giving it strength in New York, said Erik Nickerson, a foreign exchange economist with the Bank of America.
 
Dollar at 109.30 Yen in Tokyo
 In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 109.30 yen, up 0.46 yen from Tuesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at the higher rate of 109.65 yen. In New York, the dollar finished at 109.78 yen, up from 109.40 Tuesday.
"It gave confidence to buy dollars against the mark as well," Mr. Nickerson said.
In fact, when the London market closed, there was a rally in New York, Kevin Lawrie, a foreign exchange manager with the Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said.
It was a matter of "people just seeing what was up there," he said.
The dollar ended its European trading at 1.7160 German marks, up from 1.7140 late Tuesday. In New York, the dollar ended at 1.7175 German marks, up from 1.7150 late Tuesday.
Meanwhile, Mr. Lawrie added: "The market is thin and there is some underlying bull sentiment. Everything still favors the dollar."
 
'A Risk Potential'
 Analysts said that the dollar was favored because the Russian political situation was unsettled. A leading vote-getter in the parliamentary elections over the weekend was a hard-line nationalist, Vladimir Zhirinovsky.
"They see a risk potential there, but it's not immediate," Mr. Nickerson said. "It provides another reason to make dollars attractive, although we don't see a huge move into dollars." Traders generally favor the dollar as a safe haven in times of international uncertainty.
Also, the market found signs of a strengthening economy in a Federal Reserve report that said the output at the nation's factories, mines and utilities shot up nine-tenths of 1 percent in November. This was the sixth straight monthly gain and the largest in a year.
In New York, the British pound fell to $1.4790, from $1.4885 on Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
The villain theory about savings and loans gets some backing.

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
EVERYBODY -- everybody, that is, but economists -- knows that the great savings and loan bust of the 1980's was the handiwork of thieves. Now, a couple of heavyweight academics, George Ackerlof and Paul Romer of the University of California at Berkeley, have come around to the popular view. Indeed, in an article to be published later this month in the Brookings Institution's Papers on Economic Activity, they go much further, blaming the perpetrators of the savings and loan scam for the junk bond and corporate takeover excesses of the decade.
Where the truth lies is still unclear. What is clear, though, is that the Ackerlof-Romer "looting" hypothesis will raise the dander of economists who are convinced that the financial scandal had much more to do with perverse Government incentives than outright villainy. 
 Common sense suggests that it takes bad people to make bad things happen. And certainly all the anecdotes about the Sun Belt hustlers who drank Dom Perignon while their savings and loans crumbled have done nothing to change the conventional wisdom. But specialists in financial regulation have generally been uncomfortable with the idea that the Devil alone made them do it.
Dan Brumbaugh, a former economist with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board who has written extensively about the savings and loan crisis, emphasizes the industry's predicament in the early 1980's. Obliged to pay double-digit interest rates to keep deposits, yet stuck with portfolios of home mortgages paying far less, many savings and loans were, as a practical matter, insolvent by 1982.
But Federal regulators did not have reserves to pay off the insured depositors. So rather than ordering the institutions to shut down, Washington actively encouraged insolvent savings and loans to grow their way out of the cash squeeze.
The savings and loans, Mr. Brumbaugh acknowledges, "had neither the experience nor the expertise" to invest in commercial real estate. That, however, is where most of their depositors' money ended up because that is where the action (and hope of resurrection) was. The result, of course, was to convert a major headache for the deposit insurance system into a catastrophe for taxpayers.
Who is to blame for the billions of dollars in losses on see-through office buildings and ghost town housing tracts? Lawrence White, a former savings regulator who teaches economics at the Stern School of Business of New York University, dismisses hindsight about the inevitability of the commercial real estate collapse. In 1983, he notes, "there were a lot of people who still thought oil prices were headed for $50 a barrel, and even more who didn't foresee the 1986 Tax Reform Act."
But Mr. Ackerlof and Mr. Romer believe much worse was involved than aggressive risk-taking egged on by Washington. The Government's casual regulatory stance, they argue, offered the owners of savings institutions an alluring opportunity to profit from bankruptcy.
The idea was to borrow enormous sums from the public, courtesy of deposit insurance, and lend the money to anyone who would agree to pay high fees up front that could be paid out as bonuses or dividends. Real estate development was the ideal vehicle, they suggest, because it permitted the institutions to book "profits" on interest payments for years before a project would actually have to prove its worth in the marketplace.
Of course, the train would eventually run out of gravy. But the owner of an insolvent savings institution who was careful to stop short of provable fraud could end up rich -- and free to go and sin again.
Worse, argue the Berkeley pair, the waste wrought by bankruptcy-for-profit scams extended far beyond the shady transactions. Overbuilding also brought down honest developers who entered the market early on, in expectation that their competitors' behavior would be governed by the wisdom of Adam Smith rather than that of Cheech and Chong.
Bankruptcy-for-profit may also have generated the money to support the market in junk bonds that, in turn, supported the rash of leveraged buyouts in the late 1980's. While the two economists concede that savings and loan purchases of high-risk bonds represented just a tiny fraction of such bonds issued, they calculate that the sums were sufficient to prop up the borrowers most likely to default, thereby allowing the principals to take home huge fees and commissions for years longer.
Who makes the better case? The Ackerlof-Romer hypothesis is both plausible and logically consistent -- and it meshes well with increasingly dark contemporary interpretations of America's 1980's love affair with cowboy capitalism.
But as Mr. White notes, the Berkeley pair offer no acid test for separating the crooks from the incompetents. And for true connoisseurs of doom, the old story still holds attractions. Which, after all, is worse: a financial market in which the knaves took temporary advantage of rapid (and in the long term desirable) change to steal a fortune, or one so complicated and fragile that it is inherently beyond control by fallible politicians and regulators?

HEADLINE: Where The Boys Are: Home Ec

BYLINE: By LISA M. MILLER

DATELINE: FAIRFAX , Va.

 BODY:
GRAHAM McMAMEE stood at a counter in a classroom kitchen at his school preparing lunch for a group of hungry toddlers.
"Hopefully, I will work with children, maybe in day care, after I graduate," said Mr. McMamee, an 18-year-old senior at Robinson Secondary School in Fairfax, Va., a suburb of Washington. 
 Some of the boys at Robinson still wouldn't be caught dead in them, and many still think they're only for girls. Yet, slowly but surely, home economics classes at other schools across the country are attracting boys who want to learn how to become good parents, improve their communications skills, cook pasta or have better relationships with their families.
Stereotyped for decades as "girls' classes," for teen-agers preparing to be good wives, home economics has a new focus and, in some parts of the country, even a new name -- Work and Family Studies or Life-Management Education.
And with those changes has come a new following.
Nick Rhoton, 17, a senior at Gate City (Va.) High School, likes to play tennis and basketball and acts in community theaters in his spare time. But Mr. Rhoton has an unusual item on his resume: he is the national president of a somewhat forgotten student organization, the Future Homemakers of America. He is the third young man to hold that office in the last eight years. "Males are realizing their roles in society," Mr. Rhoton said. "Everyone is a homemaker. Everyone will run a home. Home economics isn't just a class: it shows how to live in your society."
Of the estimated 5.3 million students in the United States enrolled in home economics classes this year in grades 7 through 12, 41.5 percent are boys, compared with 4.2 percent of 2.2 million students in 1968, said Alan T. Rains Jr., the executive director of Future Homemakers, in Reston, Va.
The group that Mr. Rains oversees started out in 1945 as a sister organization to the Future Farmers of America. Back then, its purpose was to use extracurricular activities to teach girls how to become better cooks and seamstresses. Future Homemakers has changed with the times, and since the early 1970's has aimed its programs at both boys and girls, teaching how to "balance work and family roles," Mr. Rains said.
The number of boys who call themselves Future Homemakers has risen steadily since 1965, from less than 1 percent of the group's membership to 16 percent this year. Nonetheless, the group is struggling to keep going, as overall membership has fallen steadily, from a high of 549,488 in 1965 (when the group merged with the New Homemakers of America, which operated in black schools in the segregated South) to 262,239 this year.
Mr. Rains attributed the drop in part to a declining high school population, lingering stereotypes about women who stay at home and what he said was a "decrease in the amount of extracurricular time a student has." In 1971, to increase its membership, the group started its Home Economics Related Occupations division, which helps schools develop a broad array of courses in skills that range from resume writing and preparing for interviews to entrepreneurship, family problem solving and financial management.
And to recruit more boys, it has also been stressing subjects that take into account the multiple roles that men can play in the family, with classes like Family Communications Skills.
Although the organization's overall focus, the family, has not changed, the "definition of what family is has changed," Mr. Rains said.
In some places, not just the curriculum, but even the course name is different. Last year in Virginia, Home Economics was changed to Work and Family Studies.
"The change is going on in junior high, high schools and universities all over the country," Mr. Rains said. "Some school systems are calling it Life-Management Education, Family and Consumer Sciences or Human Environment Ecology." Even Future Homemakers has debated over the years whether to change its name.
Whatever home economics is called, more boys are finding that so-called girls' classes can be interesting and helpful in their pursuit of an occupation or in their everyday lives.
"I'm learning how to coordinate my wardrobe and my room," said Vinnie Johar, a ninth grader at Robinson Secondary School who is taking Housing and Interior Design, a course that helps students make decisions on selecting, furnishing and decorating a home. "I don't want it as a career," he said. "I wanted to learn something new."
The idea that learning how to cook and manage a household might involve a process of education beyond the folkloric learning at one's mother's knee was largely an American invention. In 1841, a domestic reformer, Catherine Beecher, whose younger sister was Harriet Beecher Stowe, published her "Treatise on Domestic Economy," in which she complained that "women are not trained for their profession," and offered details on techniques for cooking, cleaning and furnishing a home.
The outlines of homemaking and home economics as a quasi science emerged early in this century. Two women whose husbands were disciples of the industrial-efficiency expert Frederick Winslow Taylor offered guides to rationalizing and "scientifically" simplifying the work of the homemaker along the lines of more tangibly productive work, like farming and manufacturing.
Christine Frederick wrote "Household Engineering" in 1915 and later created a correspondence course based on its ideas.
Lillian Gilbreth, a pioneer of household engineering -- she practiced it daily as the mother of 12 children and became known to millions through the book "Cheaper by the Dozen," written by two of her children -- helped make home economics a respectable academic discipline with several books, including "The Homemaker and Her Job."
By the early 1900's, home economics courses were taught at many colleges and universities, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Columbia University.
At Robinson, which Future Homemakers points to as a success, courses are offered that are much different from the how-to-make-a-good-pot-roast classes of the 1940's and '50's -- courses like Relationships, in which students are taught through class discussions and role playing how to interact with family, friends and society; Child Development and Parenting, about the growth patterns of children from birth to age 6, and Teen Living, which covers cooking techniques, table manners, nutrition and the art of maintaining satisfactory relationships. Zach Nichols, an eighth grader, had a very simple reason for signing up for Teen Living. "I'm in this class because I like to eat food," he said. "And if I don't get married, I'm going to have to cook my own food."
One teacher who has been involved in many of the changes in Fairfax is Nancy Henderson. She has been teaching home economics in Fairfax since 1972, but started in the fall of 1954 in small rural towns in Texas.
"Back then, we were teaching young ladies how to function in a nuclear family," said Mrs. Henderson, who was on the board of Future Homemakers from 1986 to 1990. "Their primary focus was to learn how to decorate their homes, raise their children and become involved in community service. Now, both parents are going to work and supervise the home."
Although studies show that women still do most of the housework, there are no specific courses at Robinson that teach students solely about housekeeping.
"We teach some housekeeping skills to an extent in each class," Mrs. Henderson said. "Seventh and eighth graders learn about laundry and mending. Older students learn how to clean in the kitchen and use the washer and dryer."
While some boys have a lot of catching up to do, for many girls, like Chantel Chuck, 13, an eighth grader at Robinson, home economics classes are simple reinforcement. "Girls know the stuff already," she said, "so it's an easy A."
Such attitudes, though, aren't lost on some of the boys -- boys like Alan Rindfleisch, 14, who is taking Fitness and Foods at Robinson. "It's a break in the day from all the hard classes," he said.
But many male students, like Mr. Rhoton, take the subject more seriously and have found it has led them to highly visible leadership positions. Thomas Lucas became the first male national president of Future Homemakers in 1986-87 while attending Barboursville (W.Va.) High School; Corey Brown held the post last school year while a student at Gettysburg (S.D.) High School. The president is elected by student delegates from around the country every July at the group's national convention.
Mr. Rhoton, the current president of Future Homemakers, whose mother was a home economics teacher and who points to her as an inspiration, said that the communications skills he learned in an eighth-grade family-management class at Gate City Middle School will remain with him for the rest of his life. He plans to start college next year to study broadcast journalism. "I am so confident about public speaking and talking to people," he said, "that whatever I choose to do, the organization would have benefited me more than anything else."

HEADLINE: Thanks, Mom. Here's Your New House.

BYLINE: By ELAINE LOUIE

 BODY:
IN a material world, perhaps there is no greater gift than a house.
"Any kid growing up in the ghetto wishes to buy Mama a decent house," said Shabba Ranks, 27, a Jamaican reggae star. Mr. Ranks bought his mother, Constance Christie, a house in Kingston, Jamaica. Mother and son are to move in at the end of this month. 
 Mr. Ranks's action is in the house-giving tradition of many performers who have made it big. Among them is Desmond Child, a rock songwriter, who gave his mother a condominium in Florida in 1989. And in 1984, Chris Frantz and Tina Weymouth of the group Talking Heads bought her parents a sailboat, a water-borne home, since her father retired as a vice admiral in the Navy.
"I think of it -- supplying the old folks with a homestead -- as people coming from the bottom rungs of the society, economically," said Jerry Wexler, who has produced records for performers like Ray Charles and Wilson Pickett. "A classic story is a black young man who is one of 16 siblings, who makes it big with a rap group or in the N.B.A. and furnishes Mom with a home."
But the tradition spans classes, races and cultures. And as Mr. Wexler noted, it's a gesture that carries a lot of sentiment.
Mr. Ranks, one of seven children, is a classic example. His image is that of a lover (a special edition of his record "X-Tra Naked" had a condom tucked into the sleeve). But beneath the surface of this star, whose first and third records each sold at least 500,000 copies, is a mama's boy.
His father, Ivan Gordon, who died in 1990, was a mason. "My father used to do a man's job -- he supported us," said Mr. Ranks, who spoke of his father as if he were a distant memory. But when he talked about his mother, emotion filled his deep voice.
In Kingston, Mr. Ranks's mother worked on buses, first as a conductor, then as a driver. She and Mr. Gordon, who never married, had two daughters and five sons. Mr. Ranks, whose given name is Rexton Gordon, is the middle child. Shabba Ranks is his stage name.
In 1983, Ms. Christie and Mr. Ranks, who has been recording since he was 14, bought their first home, a house in Kingston with two bedrooms -- one for the parents, the other for the children. "We grew up in nothing," Mr. Ranks said, describing the one-room house he first lived in. But he knew how to save money. In school, children had their own penny bank books, into which they put money two days a week. "If we have 6 cents, we spend 4 cents and hide 2 cents," he said.
In 1992, vandals broke into the home, tied up his brothers and wrecked music awards he had won. Last year, Mr. Ranks bought a 20-year-old house, which has just been renovated. "I'm going to live as close as possible to my mom," he said. They will live opposite each other, in fact, each in a wing of the house, separated only by a swimming pool.
The house has many rooms, he said. How many? He counted, quietly, to 16. Behind the house is a garden. He recited a litany of the fruit there, including mangoes, papayas, sweetsops, cherries and coconuts.
When his mother moves in she will sit on leather sofas and dining chairs made of hand-carved mahogany. As the sun sets in Kingston, the house will be lighted by crystal chandeliers, said Cindy Breakspeare, the interior designer of the house.
Ms. Christie takes no credit for raising her children alone. "The father gave them love," she said.
And Shabba is a joy to her. "He has given me pleasure, courage," she said. "He is so important to me, because I am everything in his life."
Elena Casals has also inspired generosity from her son Desmond Child, 40, who wrote songs like "Livin' on a Prayer" and "You Give Love a Bad Name" and others recorded by performers like Bon Jovi and Cher.
In 1989, he bought her a condominium in the South Beach section of Miami Beach, where, from her windows, she can watch fashion models posing in the sand for photographers. She moved from a one-story house in Overtown, a neighborhood in Miami, where her windows were covered with steel bars and where she was once robbed.
Mr. Child was born in Gainesville, Fla. His mother, who is Cuban, was married to John Barrett, an American geologist. They divorced when Mr. Child, whose given name is John Charles Barrett, was 4 1/2 and his brother, Fred, was 2. They moved from Gainesville to Miami, where home was a housing project and the furniture was plastic, some of it broken. Mrs. Casals, who remarried, raised her sons by working different jobs.
Some families yearn for a house. Mrs. Casals had a more modest dream. She wanted furniture. When the children were young, she took them to furniture stores, where they sat on the pristine sofas and chairs, bounced on the cushions and imagined the furniture in their home.
In 1989, Mr. Child bought two homes: one for himself -- a $2 million Spanish-style home in Santa Monica, Calif. -- and the smaller place in Florida for his mother. "I felt I had neglected my mom," he said. After she was robbed, he flew to Miami and drove her to Miami Beach, where he saw a brand-new pink building. They stopped, asked to see a two-bedroom model apartment on the ninth floor and bought it, for $140,000, on the spot.
Then they shopped -- at the same furniture stores they had gone to 20 years before. "We finally got to do it for real life," Mr. Child said. They chose a "a beautiful ivory grand piano, beautiful off-white rugs, beautiful urns," he said.
Across the street from the condominium is a discotheque. "I hear the beautiful music," said Mrs. Casals, who is now a real-estate agent part time. She is mesmerized by the view. "You see the big boats coming in and out, the surfers," she said.
Some people's living quarters afford views from the opposite perspective. Take Ralph and Lo Weymouth, the parents of Tina Weymouth. They spend four to five months a year on the Katrinka, a 48-foot sloop that Ms. Weymouth and her husband, Chris Frantz, bought for them.
The boat is kept in Nassau, the Bahamas. The Weymouths, both of whom are in their 70's, spend four to five months a year on it.
"It's absolutely idyllic," Mrs. Weymouth said from Nassau. "I wish you could see the view, see the breakers coming in, and the palm trees waving here, and the reef, which is turquoise, and the ocean, which is dark blue."
Ms. Weymouth, 42, is one of eight children born to a family of seafarers. Her father built his first boat when he was 11. Ms. Weymouth's great-great-grandfather Egbert Sewall was the captain and owner of the Istria, a clipper ship, in the 1850's and 1860's. Mr. Sewall once sailed around the Adriatic Sea with his family. He even kept a cow on board, so the children could have milk.
"That has been a family dream -- reducing life to its real essentials by escaping on a boat," Ms. Weymouth said. "I hear my parents dream their dreams."
Ralph and Lo Weymouth made their home on naval bases from Honolulu to Iceland. In 1984, Ms. Weymouth and Mr. Frantz, 42, made the Weymouth family dream come true.
That year, the Talking Heads (with Ms. Weymouth on bass and Mr. Frantz on drums) had spent nine months on the road, promoting the film "Stop Making Sense" and the album "Speaking in Tongues." "That brought us considerable fame, and all the problems that entailed," Mr. Frantz said. "A sort of burnout."
To refuel, they bought the boat and invited her parents to sail. "Usually when rock stars arrive, they give a home to their parents," Mrs. Weymouth said. "But Tina said: 'You don't need a home. Daddy needs a boat.' "
But not all rock stars are generous. Albert Goldman, the author of "The Lives of John Lennon" (William Morrow, 1988), said there have been plenty of big stars who did not buy their parents homes, stars like Jim Morrison, the lead singer of the Doors, whose life and death are part of rock lore. He "described his parents as dead when they were alive," Mr. Goldman said.

 BODY:
A front-page chart yesterday about the highlights of the world trade agreement referred incorrectly in some editions to the timetable for its approval by Congress. The agreement requires the President's signature by April 15; he may submit it to Congress at any time after signing it. The pact is scheduled to go into effect July 1, 1995. If Congress has not approved it by then, the United States will be vulnerable to trade sanctions.
A related front-page article yesterday about how free trade promotes growth misstated the first name of an economist at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. She is Kim Elliott, not Tim. 
 A news analysis article in Business Day yesterday about the agreement referred incorrectly in some copies to the number of participating nations. There are 117, not 116.

HEADLINE: After Seven Years, a Global Gift

 BODY:
The trade agreement completed yesterday after seven tortuous years of negotiations among 117 countries is good for the U.S. and good for the world. Its real importance lies less in its individual provisions than in its vibrant message; the world's trading partners have now pledged to keep marching relentlessly toward liberalized trade. And that, in turn, will bring higher living standards than any other government policy will.
For the first time, agriculture, services, textiles and investment will be covered by international rules of fair trade. Tariffs and trade barriers will tumble. Those changes should drive down consumer prices on everything from clothing to computers. And lower prices will mean higher living standards, especially for the poor. 
 Around-the-clock bargaining between Mickey Kantor of the U.S. and Sir Leon Brittan of the European Union was decisive in bringing negotiations to a successful close. Their efforts paid off; had the talks collapsed, momentum would have shifted toward countries that seek advantage by raising tariffs. Eventually, the law of the jungle would have shrunk economies everywhere.
For the U.S., the agreement makes important headway. It reduces tariffs by about a third. U.S. exporters will sell more construction equipment, computer chips and pharmaceuticals. Some concessions took real political courage. The new Japanese Government, for example, agreed to import rice, a product of mythic importance to the Japanese.
For the first time, international rules will protect copyrights and patents on books, computer software and other intellectual property that have been routinely pirated. The agreement, also for the first time, protects the right of service-sector companies -- accounting, management consulting and other industries in which the U.S. is strong -- to operate on foreign soil free of discriminatory laws.
The agreement sets up effective procedures for resolving disputes. Under current rules, countries accused of violating trade agreements can block a judicial panel's negative ruling; under the new rules, defendants would have no such power.
That said, the treaty falls shy of the goals set out in 1986 when the Uruguay Round started. Important industries, like movies, shipping and telecommunications, were left out of the agreement. The U.S. pulled financial services -- including banking, securities and other industries dominated by the U.S. -- from the accord because Japan and other Asian countries refused to grant the same unfettered access to U.S. firms that the U.S. grants to them. And third-world countries did not receive the access they deserved to textile markets in the industrialized countries.
The third world is also displeased by some provisions on unfair trade practices. Under current rules, countries may retaliate against products that are unfairly subsidized by foreign governments or sold at prices below the foreigner's cost of production -- a practice known as dumping. But many countries, including the U.S., have abused that right by raising tariffs on legitimate goods in order to protect domestic industry. The Uruguay Round will not eliminate the foul play.
The Uruguay Round's purpose was to liberalize trade, thereby subjecting producers everywhere to more intense competition. The agreement could have been better. But it's a victory for the U.S., opening up markets for many of the goods it produces best, and a victory for the global economy.

HEADLINE: SKIING;
The Looks Don't Count With Equipment

BYLINE: By BARBARA LLOYD

 BODY:
Tamara McKinney, the 1989 World Cup skiing champion, still moves with power and precision on the slopes. But at 5 feet 3 inches, she is a relatively small racer who has always chosen skis and boots that are more flexible than bigger ski competitors require.
Stiff skis and boots are more responsive for edging than softer ones, but they also tend to be uncomfortable and unnecessary for skiers who do not have trophies on the mind. When it comes to advice for women who are shopping for recreational equipment, McKinney, 31 years old and a competitor in an annual Tournament of Champions league, advises, "Look out for the impostors." 
 The impostors to which McKinney refers are manufacturers who are deluging the market with products developed for the female skier. "You can see a big difference in your skiing by getting on equipment that responds the way it is supposed to," McKinney said during a recent interview.
Impostors tend to hide behind cosmetic changes in their skis and boots -- such as light, feminine colors and glitzy graphics -- without making the essential design differences that separate the needs of men and women skiers, McKinney said.
 
The Market Is There
 The rush to accommodate women has economic roots. "Skiing until very recently has been a male-dominated industry," said Jeanne-Marie Gand, director of advertising for Rossignol in the United States. "But there has been a big wake-up call this year to women in skiing. The market is there, and women have become much more savvy buyers."
The National Sporting Goods Association estimates that of the 10.8 million skiers in 1992, 40 percent were women. In 1989, 35 percent of skiers were women. This year, the first magazine for women in the sport, Skiing for Women, was introduced by the Times Mirror Corporation.
Some experts question how much women need special equipment. Tait Wardlaw, a technical editor at Ski Racing, a competitors' journal, and Ski magazine, said recently that gear for women was more important in boots than in skis.
"Much of it's lip service as much as anything else," Wardlaw said about ski design. "When you get to a level where you can tell the difference between men's skis and women's skis, most of those women are so good and so strong that they would just as soon ski on a men's ski."
The editors of Skiing for Women tend to agree. "If you're looking for real power out of the turn and rock-solid edge grip on the ice, you'd best begin your search among unisex racing models," the magazine said in its winter 1994 issue. The magazine rated 12 ski companies offering special designs for women that generally are best if "ease of turning, comfort and improvement in your technique are your goals."
 
The Strength Factor
 Seth Masia, a technical expert with K2 Skis, concedes that expert women perform just as well on a unisex ski, but for average skiers there is a need to design especially for women. K2 does market a line of women's skis, including the popular LTP.
Masia said that the main difference between male and female skiers has to do with upper body strength. "Anything else doesn't address the real issue," Masia said. "A guy with good upper body strength uses the pole to assist in directional change while women, who generally have 30-40 percent less upper body strength, don't have that option."
But what about boots? Manufacturers are generally concluding that women's boots should be shaped differently from men's. Designers are allowing for narrower heels in women's boots and compensating for calf muscles that are lower on the leg by dropping a boot's cuff. Some are also adding heel lifts to adjust for what they see as a lower center of gravity among women.
To address the gender gap in equipment, Rossignol is offering four skiing workshops for women this year. The $195 cost of the two-day clinics includes the use of Rossignol's new skis and boots designed for women.
McKinney, sponsored by Rossignol for the last 10 years, will be on hand for instruction, as well as two former United States world ski champions, Christin Cooper and Kiki Cutter.
The first workshop is scheduled for this weekend at Killington, Vt. Others are planned for ski resorts in Colorado, Minnesota and California later in the season. Rossignol can be called at (802) 863-2511 for more information.
 
Midwest Alternative
 As part of her series of women's clinics, Jeannie Thoren of Duluth, Minn., focuses on equipment. In addition to providing a choice of additional equipment from various manufacturers, Thoren also advises students on ways to adjust their own gear to improve its performance. Her advice includes an unorthodox suggestion that women move their bindings forward about an inch from the standard position to counteract a lower center of gravity.
For information on the daylong clinics, which cost under $50 and are located mostly in the Midwest, Thoren can be reached at (218) 724-5809.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD TRADE AGREEMENT: The Overview;
GATT Talks End in Joy and Relief

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, Dec. 15

 BODY:
A small wooden gavel came down on a table here today, signaling, with a sharp tap, the completion of the long-contested world trade agreement intended to provide the basis for global economic growth and cohesion into the 21st century.
As he lowered his hammer like an auctioneer completing a sale, Peter Sutherland, the Irish lawyer who oversaw the last phase of the seven-year trade negotiations as GATT's Director General, declared, "I gavel the Uruguay Round as concluded." 
 Representatives from the 117 member nations of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade leaped to their feet in the brown-carpeted, granite-walled conference hall here -- applauding, cheering, even succumbing to bear hugs.
 
The Worst Is Past
 Their sense of relief was palpable: A deal had finally been done and the worst averted, after a negotiation that at times seemed more likely to reveal the irreconcilable trade rivalries of the post-cold-war world than its determination to pursue a quest for freer trade, lower tariffs and greater economic cooperation.
"There are those, not without reason, who find the post-cold-war world full of new risks and tensions," Mr. Sutherland said. "Today, the world has chosen openness and cooperation instead of uncertainty and conflict. This is a success that will reinforce economic growth."
In fact, as several delegates remarked here today, the 400-page Final Act of the negotiations ended as an incomplete compromise, much better than nothing, but far less than once hoped.
"To conclude this is, in itself, a major achievement," said Luiz Felipe Palmeira Lampreia, Brazil's representative here, "even if we are left with mixed feelings."
 
Close Call for Clinton
 The agreement came after a first, formal deadline in December 1990 was missed and later target dates produced nothing. In the end, Mr. Sutherland announced the conclusion just 10 hours before the cutoff of President Clinton's "fast track" authority, allowing him to send the GATT accord to Congress to be voted on without amendments.
Within an hour of agreement, President Clinton said he would submit the pact to Congress. "This agreement did not accomplish everything we wanted, but today's GATT accord does meet the test of a good agreement," he said in Washington.
After approval by Congress last month of the North American Free Trade Agreement -- and the intense battle the President waged to gain that approval -- the new accord underscored the Administration's once-doubted commitment to free trade. It also indicated the belief of Mr. Clinton and his advisers that jobs, growth and national security are, in the end, better served by an open world trading system than protectionism or recourse to regional trading blocs.
In Paris, Prime Minister Edouard Balladur, who repeatedly clashed with the President over issues ranging from agriculture to access for American films to European markets, declared in Parliament that the accord was in France's interest.
"The cultural identity of Europe is protected, the future of French agriculture assured," he said, before winning a vote of confidence by 466 to 90 in the lower house.
Under the agreement, to be signed in Morocco in April and due to come into effect in 1995, worldwide tariffs were cut by an average of one-third, encouraging the freer movement of goods, and industries like agriculture were brought under GATT rules for the first time, implying the gradual elimination of subsidies that are costly to taxpayers.
 
Little Gain on Many Services
 But accords on the world's trillion-dollar annual trade in services like banking and the movie and entertainment industries proved elusive, leaving some of the fastest-developing parts of the world's economy encumbered by national or regional protectionism of the sort that discourages foreign investment.
The agreement, before coming into effect, faces potentially contentious legislative battles in the United States and elsewhere.
Today, South Korean students, angered by the lifting of the country's ban on rice imports, rioted and shouted "Yankee go home." And some Indian legislators denounced what they depicted as the sale of the country to American imperialists after it was announced that the Government had accepted the accord and an eventual lowering of tariffs on textiles.
The agreement came after a series of last-minute flurries. The American trade representative, Mickey Kantor, won an 11th-hour change of name for the new international trade organization that is to be established in 1995 to police the accord and settle trade disputes.
Instead of the Multilateral Trade Organization, it will be called the World Trade Organization.
"It just sounds a lot less bureaucratic and has more gravitas," Mr. Kantor said.
The United States, concerned for some time that the organization could compromise the effectiveness of national trade legislation, withheld final approval of the new body until today.
The European Community bickered among itself to the last.
 
At the End, Portuguese Textiles
 At a meeting in Brussels, European foreign ministers had to allocate more than $450 million to Portugal to compensate it for the GATT accord's effect on the country's textile industry before Portugal would accept it. The Portuguese had argued that the community's gradual lowering of barriers to textile imports was not sufficiently compensated by openings in the textile markets in the United States and in big Asian countries.
The European ministers also approved a speeded-up procedure for taking trade action against countries selling products below cost in the European market before France would announce its approval.
The French Foreign Minister, Alain Juppe, emerging from the meeting, remarked, "I never want to hear the word GATT again."

CORRECTION-DATE: December 23, 1993, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
A chart in Business Day on Dec. 16, with articles about the conclusion of talks on a General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, misstated an estimate made by Myron E. Ullman 3d, chairman and chief executive of R. H. Macy & Company, of the amount that American consumers pay extra for clothing because of tariffs and quotas on imported apparel and fabrics. He estimated the amount at $46 billion a year, not $46 million.

GRAPHIC: Photos: "I gavel the Uruguay Round as concluded," said Peter Sutherland, who closed the meetings of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. "Today, the world has chosen openness and cooperation instead of uncertainty and conflict," Mr. Sutherland declared. (Associated Press) (pg. D1); About 40 Belgian farmers yesterday protested the accord reached under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which they fear will threaten their livelihoods. The farmers set fire to a tractor during the demonstration outside the headquarters of the European Community in Brussels. (Reuters)
 
Chart: "GATT: The Effect on Industry"
 It took seven year for 117 countries to agree on a pact that would modify world trade for the firt time since 1979. But in expanding rules that would cut some tariffs and eliminate others as a way to stimulate business and investment, negotiators have not satisfied every industry in the United States, despite some estimates the agreement could generate as much as $200 billion in new business. President Clinton notified Congress yesterday that the United States intended to sign the agreement on April 15. Here is a closer look at the industries that won, lost or came away with a draw under GATT.
 
Agriculture DRAW
 Some groups, like the National Farmers Organization, say freer trade under GATT is bad for agriculture everywhere because it increases efficiency to a point where less efficient farmers are driven out of business and some rural communities threatened with extinction. But most American grain farmers expect to benefit from reduction in worldwide export subsidies under GATT, although some grumble that the side agreement with the Europeans slowed the pace of subsidy reduction from the Blair House accord of 1992. Fruit, vegetable and rice growers expect better access to foreign markets. Domestic crops protected by strict quotas, like sugar, cotton and peanuts, will see slight increases in import competition over time.
 
Banking DRAW
 The stakes for the banking industry were small, and the results were inconclusive. The agreement neither opened new markets for American banks nor restricted the ability of the United States to retaliate against countries that maintain barrier. "We did not get stuck with the door locked open," said Christopher Rieck, a spokesman for the American Bankers Association. Since banks already have access to markets in Europe and Japan, the industry's only concern, which is subject to future negotiations, is gaining the right to open branches in developing countries. This mainly affects Citibank, which is the only American bank interested in running retail branches overeas.
 
Brokerage firms DRAW
The failure of GATT negotiators to agree on a plan for foreign countries to drop barriers to American securities firms was disappointing, said David G. Strongin, director of international finance at the Securities Industry Association. Securities dealer were pleased, however, that the agreement leaves the United States Government the right to negotiate with individual countries about their barrier, rather than requiring use of GATT's formal dispute settlement system. At Merrill Lynch, GATT was viewed as less important than the North American Free Trade Agreement earlier in the year, which called for Mexico to open its borders to foreign securities firms.
 
Insurance DRAW
"We were disappointed that we did not get an agreement for foreign countries to remove barriers protecting their insurance industry, but the mere fact that, for the firt time, financial services such as insurance were on the GATT agenda was important progress," said George Henry, vice president of the American Insurance Association. The GATT talks did produce an agreement to give foreign countries an extra six months beyond the start of GATT on July 1, 1995 to remove barriers protecting their insurance industry. After that, the United States is free to impose trade sanctions against those countries.
 
Capital Goods WINNER
The gradual elimination of tariffs should help American makers of capital goods by stimulating world economies and thus demand for manufactured products. The United States capital goods industry also has some of the world's lowest- cost producer, who are well positioned to compete on price and will not miss losing the protection of antidumping suits at home. It was "certainly not all we wanted, but our bottom line was this was one heck of a good agreement," said Timothy Elder, a spokesman for Caterpillar, a heavy-equipment maker.
 
Forest Products DRAW
The trade pact is expected to be more welcome to the paper industry than to lumber. The United States exports only limited amounts of lumber, and prices of American lumber have not been particularly competitive since efforts to protect the spotted owl made logging more expensive. American paper makers have more to gain. Until now, they have had to contend with 6 percent tariffs on any liner board, their principal export to the European Community and 9 percent on bleached board.
 
Medical Equipment WINNER
 Medical device and equipment makers said smaller companies would be the main winners as tariffs fall by $500 million a year and exports grow by $200 million to $300 million, creating about 3,000 jobs. Even larger companies with overeas plants were pleased. "Lowering trade barriers and eliminating tariffs through GATT is very good news for us," said raymond V. Gilmartin, chairman of Becton, Dickinson & Company
 
Pharmaceuticals LOSER
The pharmaceutical industry, which lobbied hard for the GATT agreement, was set back by a provision that gives developing countries like India and Brazil 10 year before they will be required to honor foreign patent claims. Trade negotiators said American drug makers lose $4.8 billion in annual sales. Noting that other types of patents must be respected after a five-year transition, Merck & Company, the world's largest drug maker, complained that pharmaceutial patents had been made the objects of discrimination. But the industry also won on some points, including 20-year patent protection from the filing date.
 
Retail WINNER
Retailers have been urging an end to quotas and tariffs on imported apparel and fabrics, which they say increase the cost of their merchandise to consumer. Myron E. Ullman 3d, chairman and chief executive of r. H. Macy & Company, which makes much of its private-label apparel abroad, says consumers pay $46 million a year extra. The GATT accord will phase out the tariff and quota system and give retailers the chance to lower prices.
 
Semiconductors WINNER
American manufacturers retained the right not to license foreign competitors who would make their products. They also kept the ability to file dumping complaints like those used to fight Japanese competition in the 1980's. There was also a modest gain on European tariffs, which will fall from 14 percent to 7 percent on imported memory products after five years.
 
Textiles LOSER
The textile industry will, over 10 year, lose the complex system of quotas that has served as a barriers to increased imports of fabrics manufactured abroad. "I consider this to be just a complete sellout of this industry," said William Farley, chairman and chief executive of Fruit of the Loom. Manufacturers had pushed for a 15-year phase-out of the current arrangement, which imposes tariffs and quotas on imported fabrics and apparel. And they wanted a reduction of tariffs and quotas to be dependent upon other countries like India and Pakistan opening their markets to American textiles. Neither of those proposals made it into the final package.
 
Toys WINNER
 "We look at this as a win-win situation for us," said David A. Miller, president of the Toy Manufacturers of America, a trade association that represents more than 200 companies. Lower tariffs will benefit the toy industry because two-thirds of the toys, games and dolls sold in the world are made by American companies. The reduced tariffs will also presumably benefit consumers with lower prices. In the case of stuffed toys and dolls, a $600 million combined business this year, the 80 percent of the companies' products made overeas now face import duties of 6 percent and 12 percent, respectively, Mr. Miller said. Without them, he said, companies would save as much as $150 million. (pg. D8)

HEADLINE: CHANGE AT THE PENTAGON;
Wounded in Policy Wars

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr.,, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 15

 BODY:
Les Aspin had studied all his life for the job. But he failed to master some key lessons, and instead of providing the capstone for his career, his service as Secretary of Defense lasted only a year and ended in ambiguity, with a decidedly equivocal record.
 To move across the Potomac to the Pentagon, Mr. Aspin had to abandon a safe Congressional seat and his post as chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. He did not do so lightly, because he knew it would be difficult if not impossible to restart an elective career in his late 50's. But after some hesitation, he decided this would probably be his only chance at the secretary's job, and he took it. 
That is one of the main reasons that the national-security insiders in Washington, who have known him well for decades, put little credence in his explanation that he wanted a break from government service. One of them commented tonight: "He thrived on this stuff; to tell the truth, he didn't have much of a life outside his work, and he'll be lost without it."
 
'Time to Pass the Baton<HHE>
 Asked whether he had been forced out, one of the Secretary's closest co-workers answered: "You know how this town operates as well as I do. I can only say I think my friend read the evidence and made the right decision. It's a relay race, not a marathon, and he decided that one lap was enough: it was time to pass the baton."
 Mr. Aspin worked hard to develop new policies on difficult issues that grew out of the end of the cold war, like the reduction in the size of American armed forces, the intensified problem of proliferation of nuclear weapons and heightened regional dangers. He also wrestled with tough questions that he told friends he would not have chosen and that others might have shirked: homosexuals in the armed forces, women in combat roles and the Tailhook convention, at which naval aviators made sexual assaults on women.
 But his policies and his actions cut across entrenched interests, and that hurt him. So, several senior officials said, did his decision not to reinforce American troops in Somalia, when officers on the scene had urged quick action. When American Rangers were pinned down, suffering 18 deaths and 75 injuries, a cry went up for his scalp.
 "We have a dilemma, which Somalia exemplified," an ally of Mr. Aspin said. "We haven't worked out when, where and how we are going to commit our forces in this new age. Les hasn't worked it out, nobody's worked it out. He opposed the use of force in Haiti and Bosnia and won, but he lost in Somalia -- and in that sense he is a victim of our failure to make a national decision.
 "Mr. and Mrs. Couch Potato want us to stop civil wars and save the hungry. They see the military as the best way to do that, but when people get killed, they won't stand for it. The President will have to resolve that issue."
 
Hailed at Beginning
 It is President Clinton's responsibility, of course, to make the final decisions on all the big issues. But Mr. Aspin got tangled in one controversy after another, and he was an obvious target when leading Democrats began pressing for change in the foreign policy team. A change was more urgent than it might otherwise have been, many of them said, because of Mr. Clinton's own unusually weak background in and feeling for foreign policy and military affairs.
 Mr. Aspin has always been better at the substance of things than at the political penumbra that surrounds them. At one point, he was briefly forced out of his chairmanship because of his failure to perform even the most rudimentary acts of constituency-building within the Democratic membership.
 He promised to reform, but he was not very apt at covering his political flanks at the Pentagon, either.
 When the President announced that he had chosen Mr. Aspin, the Wisconsin legislator was widely hailed in Washington as the most thoroughly qualified nominee for the position since Harold Brown, who was Secretary under President Jimmy Carter.
 Both men could be described as military intellectuals, but Mr. Brown had an important advantage. He had run things before taking charge at the Defense Department. So had Dick Cheney, George Bush's Secretary, who had served as White House chief of staff in the Ford Administration before entering Congress.
 Mr. Aspin, on the other hand, was almost entirely a creature of the House of Representatives. After studying at Yale, Oxford and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he earned his Ph.D. in 1965, and after teaching economics for a while, he had worked in the Pentagon and in Vietnam as one of Robert S. McNamara's "Whiz Kids." But he was elected to Congress in 1970, when he was only 32, and had served there for 22 uninterrupted years.
 "He was an idea man when he was up here, a guy who liked to sit around and talk theory more than he liked to make decisions and issue orders," said Senator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who flew Navy attack planes over Vietnam at the same time as Mr. Aspin was analyzing the war in Saigon and Washington. "I admire him tremendously, but it's very hard to make the transition from thinking and talking to administering and commanding.
 "Cheney did it, but his background was a lot more varied than Les's."
 A burly and engaging man, Mr. Aspin was something of an absent-minded professor, whose friends teased him when he would ask them to his house and forget to offer them drinks because he was so deeply enmeshed in explaining the arcana of defense policy. And he was never strong on organization.
 
Worked as 'Chairman'
 Once he arrived at the Pentagon, his rumpled, discursive, informal style, which almost everyone found charming outside the office, drew criticism from top uniformed officers, from counterparts at the Central Intelligence Agency and, ultimately, from his former colleagues on Capitol Hill. His testimony before Congressional committees was attacked as woolly and nonresponsive.
 In his defense, his friends said tonight that he had functioned as a "chairman of the board," leaving management of the Pentagon to aides like John Deutch, an undersecretary whom Mr. Aspin had known for many years. The system worked efficiently, they said, but that was not the majority view.
 Whatever the details of his thinking, which he has apparently disclosed to very few people, Mr. Aspin is clearly worn out. His doctor gave him a clean bill of health, but he looked wan and gray when he appeared in the Oval Office this afternoon, and he seemed to have concluded that the White House viewed him as a political liability.
 "He didn't say so in so many words," one associate commented, "but he gave me the strong impression that if the President had given him a resounding vote of confidence, he would have found the energy to carry on. I talked with him every day, more or less, and he didn't strike me as a man who was leaving of his own volition."

HEADLINE: CHANGE AT THE PENTAGON: Man in the News -- Bobby Ray Inman;
An Operator for the Pentagon

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
More than a decade ago Bobby Ray Inman left Washington in a huff, vowing never to return. The city was too mean, the bureaucratic infighting too enervating, the backbiting too intense, he told intimates after serving 16 uncomfortable months as deputy to William J. Casey, who was then Director of Central Intelligence.
Shucking a long Government career, Mr. Inman went home and set up a business in Austin, Tex. But his heart never left the Potomac. Using the tools he had acquired as a four-star admiral and a spy master -- stealth and discipline -- he managed to keep his finger on the pulse of power. 
 "I am an operator," the 62-year-old Mr. Inman bluntly told reporters today after President Clinton announced his nomination to succeed Les Aspin as Secretary of Defense. "Hopefully with a strategic view."
Although he may have been using the expression the way people in uniform use it -- to make the point that he had not been just a desk-bound paper-pusher during his 31 years in the Navy, but also a man in the field -- it was natural that those who know him interpreted the word differently.
"Operator: that's arguably the magic word," said Robin West, a petroleum executive who has known Mr. Inman for nearly two decades. "He's a brilliant creature of the inside, a man who can help educate the President."
 
Essential Qualities
 Mr. Inman is one of those Washington figures whose accomplishments and peculiarities have made him a legend in the capital and a fixture on corporate boards and Government commissions, although his name is probably unknown to most of America.
Senior Administration officials say he brings to his new job three qualities that Mr. Aspin seemed to lack: credibility with the military, a highly developed sense of organization and the ability to articulate policy positions in public.
Since his days as a prize-winning whiz kid on a radio quiz show in his hometown of Rhonesboro, Tex., he has been known as a prodigy.
Under President Jimmy Carter, Mr. Inman, then a 46-year-old career Navy intelligence officer, became the youngest Director in the history of the National Security Agency, the supersecret organization that eavesdrops overseas. He was the first intelligence officer ever to receive a fourth star, and with confirmation by the Senate he will become the first career military officer since George C. Marshall to head the Pentagon.
In his years since leaving full-time Government work, Mr. Inman has nonetheless kept his hand in. Among other things, he has headed a Reagan Administration commission on embassy security and the Bush Administration's Presidential Intelligence Foreign Policy Advisory Board and served on a number of Congressional panels on intelligence.
He replaced Secretary of State Warren Christopher as vice-chairman of the New York-based Council on Foreign Relations and has served on the boards of 11 nonprofit organizations and a number of companies.
 
Endearing Style
 Along the way, he has perfected an endearing style characterized by bureaucratic finesse and intellectual grace.
He has maintained in interviews that he is so clumsy that he cannot walk across a room without bumping into the furniture but is so disciplined that when he was at the Central Intelligence Agency he rose every morning at 4 o'clock to prepare for the day by reading a huge bag of classified documents.
His gap-toothed smile and self-deprecating demeanor conceal a steely center, an extraordinary intellect and a remarkable ability to shape quietly the opinions of other officials.
Over the years, Mr. Inman has maintained political independence, a characteristic that was on display during the Rose Garden announcement today.
 
Didn't Vote for Clinton
 "I would tell you up front, honestly, I did not vote for President Clinton," he volunteered. "I voted for President Bush, even though I was mad at him about his handling of the economy, but because I considered him a personal friend."
Mr. Inman also confessed that he had neither sought nor wanted the Pentagon job, which he said he had accepted because of "duty and country."
Indeed, in the fall of 1990, after assigning himself the role of saving the contentious nomination of Robert M. Gates to be Director of Central Intelligence, he said in an interview: "I will never come back to Government. I have zero Potomac fever. I don't have the patience anymore. Watching this process has absolutely locked that in concrete."
Last year, during the transition between Presidencies, Mr. Inman was discreetly asked whether he would be interested in becoming Bill Clinton's top intelligence chief, and he politely but firmly declined. But Washington insiders who claim to know him well say he has always coveted the job of either Secretary of State or Defense Secretary. Even Mr. Inman admitted in the 1990 interview that if, at the beginning of the Bush Administration, "somebody had offered me Secretary of Defense, I might have taken it."
 
Business Years Stressed
 Today, Mr. Inman touted his business experience as perhaps the most important asset he brings to the Defense Department.
"In these last 10 years," he said, "I've learned a lot about how business works, and I would hope to spend a lot of my time on bringing the best business practices to the Department of Defense."
In fact, though, his business record has been mixed.
In 1983, he founded the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation, a consortium of computer companies, to compete with Japan's electronics giants. During his tenure, many big companies refused to join, and some that did sign on refused to provide their best researchers.
When Mr. Inman brought in talent from the outside, he angered some of the companies, which feared that unless their own technicians were in the consortium, it would be hard to use the technologies in their own products. Mr. Inman complained in a 1984 interview that some of the corporate partners were "sitting back and sipping with a long straw," and two years later he stepped down.
 
Frustrating Experience
 In 1987, Mr. Inman was made chairman and chief executive of Tracor Holdings, a large military contractor in Texas that had heavy debt from a leveraged buyout. He failed to respond adequately to the shrinking of the military, he conceded later, and two years after joining Tracor, he resigned as the company was posting enormous losses.
"I have been very frustrated with this," he said in an interview at the time. "I feel infinitely better now that this will be put in the hands of an old pro, someone who has been to the table before. I bring no expertise to bear as we proceed with asset sales and begin to restructure."
 
Ties to Arms Dealer
 A line on Mr. Inman's resume that is expected to be raised in Senate confirmation hearings concerns his relationship with a corrupt arms merchant, James Guerin, who is now serving a 15-year prison sentence for fraud, money laundering and illegal exports of military technology to South Africa and Iraq.
In 1975, when Admiral Inman was director of naval intelligence, the United States sought to spy on Soviet ships off the South African coast. Mr. Guerin's company shipped electronic eavesdropping gear to South Africa. Beginning in 1977, after President Carter severed the intelligence relationship between Washington and Pretoria, Mr. Guerin served as an intelligence agent for the United States on South Africa's nuclear-weapons program.
Then, in 1982, Mr. Inman served on a special board of outside directors for Mr. Guerin's arms company, International Signal and Control. The board's responsibility was to prevent classified information from leaking.
 
Illegal Sales of Weaponry
 Throughout the 1980's, Mr. Guerin's company illegally sold weaponry to South Africa and cluster-bomb technology to a Chilean arms merchant who helped arm Iraq.
Mr. Guerin's attempt to sell his company to a British concern resulted in a swindle that a Federal judge described in 1991 as "the largest fraud ever perpetrated in North America."
At Mr. Guerin's 1992 sentencing, Mr. Inman wrote a letter vouching for Mr. Guerin's patriotism for his spying on South Africa, although he did not advocate leniency for him.
It was unclear whether Admiral Inman knew about the arms shipments or Mr. Guerin's illegal activities, and he said in an interview at the time that he was certain that American intelligence agencies had never approved illegal conduct by Mr. Guerin's firm.
 
Unassuming Beginning
 Bobby Ray Inman was born in the dusty East Texas hamlet of Rhonesboro, the son of a service station owner, a point Mr. Clinton made today.
After graduating from the University of Texas in history at 19, he taught at an elementary school, hoping to attend Stanford Business School.
When the Korean War broke out, and he thought he would be drafted, he signed up for trhe Navy's officer candidate school and was soon decoding secret messages on an aircraft carrier. He became the American cryptographer in Paris and then studied at the Navy's intelligence school in Washington although unlike most senior flag officers, he never graduated from the Naval Academy at Annapolis.
He rose rapidly through the ranks, serving as chief intelligence officer for the 7th fleet, naval attache in Sweden, Director of Naval Intellgience and vice director of the Defense Intellgience Agency before becoming head of the National Security Agency.
 
Appeal From Reagan
 When Ronald Reagan named Mr. Casey the nation's intelligence chief, Admiral Inman resisted taking the job as deputy. According to an oft-told story, Mr. Casey had to persuade Mr. Reagan to make a personal appeal, which he did, telling him, "Admiral, I need you."
But Admiral Inman never trusted Mr. Casey, who shut him out of covert operations and was a disorganized manager, and the admiral left the job and left town as soon as it was politically acceptable.
After a 60-day, 11,000 mile driving tour of the western United States with his wife, Nancy, and their two sons, the gangly, 6-foot-2 military man with the brush cut and the boyish grin went back to Texas.

HEADLINE: CHANGE AT THE PENTAGON;
Statements by President Clinton and His Nominee to Head the Pentagon

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of President Clinton's announcement yesterday of the appointment of Bobby Ray Inman as Secretary of Defense and Mr. Inman's acceptance of that appointment, as recorded and transcribed by The New York Times:
 
By PRESIDENT CLINTON
Ladies and gentlemen, yesterday I announced that Secretary Aspin would be stepping down as Secretary of Defense next month after a year of devoted service. I want to stress again how deeply grateful I am on behalf of all Americans for his hard work and his many unique contributions to the Pentagon and to our national defense. 
 To insure the greatest possible continuity, I wanted to announce the successor as soon as possible. So today I am very pleased to announce my intent to nominate Adm. Bob Inman as the next Secretary of Defense.
Admiral Inman was one of our nation's highest-ranking and most-respected military officers. He was a four-star admiral whose career in the Navy and in our intelligence community and in private business has won him praise from both Democrats and Republicans who admire his intellect, his integrity and his leadership ability.
The admiral's experience in serving our nation is truly impressive. He personally briefed Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy. He held senior positions under Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan and Bush. Former Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger called Admiral Inman a national asset, and I know he will be a national asset as Secretary of Defense.
He brings to this job the kind of character all Americans respect. The son of a gas station owner in a small East Texas town, he rose to distinction and success on the basis of his brains, his talent and his hard work.
He finished high school at 15, graduate from college at 19, joined the Naval Reserve at 20 and then launched an impressive 31-year career in the Navy. He served on an aircraft carrier, two cruisers and a destroyer as well as in onshore assignments as an analyst for naval intelligence. In 1976, at the age of 45, he became the youngest vice admiral in peacetime history.
Bob Inman's stellar intelligence work caught the attention of many military and civilian leaders and prompted his elevation to several high posts in the intelligence community. He served as vice director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, director of the National Security Agency and deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Because of his outstanding service, he was awarded the National Security Medal by President Carter.
Over the past decade, since Admiral Inman left government, he's served in a wide range of private sector positions, including C.E.O. of two private sector electronics firms, chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and a teacher at his alma mater, the University of Texas. He's also served on 11 not-for-profit corporate boards. And in all these roles, Admiral Inman has established a reputation for penetrating analysis, strong leadership and a rock-solid commitment to this nation's security.
Those qualities will serve our nation well as the admiral becomes our next Secretary of Defense. This is a time of great change in our world. We must build on the work Les Aspin began with the bottom-up review to insure that we have the right forces and strategy for this new era. We must insure that even as we reduce force levels, our military remains ready to fight and win on a moment's notice.
We must insure that our men and women in uniform remain the best-trained, the best-equipped, the best-prepared fighting force on earth. And we must maintain and build strong bipartisan support in the Congress and in the country for the foreign policy and national defense interest of our nation.
I am confident that Admiral Inman is the right leader to meet these demanding challenges. I'm grateful that he's agreed to make the personal sacrifices necessary to return to full-time government service and to accept this important assignment at this pivotal time in world events.
I'm delighted that he will be joining our national security team, and I thank him for his service to the nation. Admiral.
 
By MR. INMAN
Thank you, Mr. President.
You do me great honor with this appointment. Notwithstanding all the wonderful things you said, I am an imperfect human being who has been provided many wonderful opportunities -- none quite yet of the status of this. I've not done all of them as well as I would like. But I've always worked hard at them, and I will work hard at this one.
As you know, I did not seek the job, honestly, and I did not want the job. Ultimately, you would ask then, why am I here?
Duty and country. I was persuaded from our lengthy conversations of the President's absolute commitment to build a strong bipartisan support for where this country needs to go in the years out ahead. I would tell you up front, honestly, I did not vote for President Clinton. I voted for President Bush, even though I was mad at him about his handling of the economy, but because I considered him a personal friend. The President did know that when he asked me to take this job.
I look forward to the challenges that are in front of us. I particularly look forward to working with the senior members of the national security team. Warren Christopher I consider an old friend, and someone I not only enjoy working with but I greatly admire. Tony Lake is a new acquaintance to me but in these very few short days, there's been a great start.
But ultimately, the key to my being willing to do this, to give up a very happy and prosperous life, was the President's commitment and our interaction. I had to be comfortable that he was persuaded I was the right choice for this time frame. And, Mr. President, as you know, I had to reach a level of comfort that we could work together, that I would be very comfortable in your role as the Commander in Chief, President, while I was Secretary of Defense. And I have found that level of comfort.
As I look at the challenges in front of us, the road ahead is already pretty well mapped. I've had the privilege of knowing Les Aspin for more than 15 years. He is truly one of the great intellects in this country. From the first meeting, he's always been challenging: What was the best approach to national security for this country? I'm persuaded that the work he's done over these last 11 months will make it vastly easier for his successor. But it won't be an easy job.
As I've tried to describe myself, I'm an operator, hopefully with a strategic view. I would hope, in the years ahead, to focus on an area that may surprise you. I've noted the media coverage this morning has focused almost entirely on my intelligence background. But in these last 10 years I've learned a lot about how business works, and I would hope to spend a lot of my time on bringing best business practices to the Department of Defense. My sense in traveling the country is that the public is less concerned about what we're doing overseas or our commitments than whether we are getting a dollar value for a dollar spent on defense.
And I would hope at the end of our years of working together, we will have persuaded them, Mr. President, that they are. And I would hope to insure that we practice standards of ethics and integrity in the Department of Defense that will be a beacon for the rest of government.
Finally, to my many friends in the media, both here and around the country -- there've been, at my last count, some 82 calls last night and this morning for interviews -- if we are going to build a bipartisan support for national security, it has to begin with establishing the best relationship with the Congress. I will be deeply respectful of the Senate's approach to the confirmation process. I believe, therefore, it will be wisest if I limit my public remarks on issues until the confirmation process is through, and then I will try to be as available to all of you in the future as I have been in the past.
Thank you very much and thank you, Mr. President, for your confidence.

HEADLINE: Gore Signs Pacts in Moscow on Joint Shuttle Crews and Oil and Gas

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 16

 BODY:
Insisting that they would not be deterred by political uncertainty, the United States and Russia formally joined as partners today on an international space station and announced that the first Russian astronaut would fly in the space shuttle Discovery in six weeks.
While both sides had agreed to the basic space accord, the agreement today formally ended decades of rivalry between Moscow and Washington. 
 Russia also accepted an invitation to join the United States, Europe, Japan and Canada in building a revamped space station. An orbiting space laboratory involving all the partners could be operating by 2001.
Vice President Al Gore and Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin also signed agreements on economic development, high-technology ventures, the environment and oil and gas exploration. Some pacts were for small but possibly fruitful projects, like plans to build as many as 25 privately financed gas stations in Russia.
 
Commitment to Yeltsin
 Mr. Gore and Mr. Chernomyrdin said at a news conference that the 17 agreements were an important sign of Washington's commitment to Russia after parliamentary elections on Sunday in which a faction that opposes President Boris N. Yeltsin's political and economic reforms did far better than expected.
"The Russian Government is committed to reform," Mr. Gore said. "President Yeltsin and Prime Minister Chernomyrdin have reaffirmed the need to press forward." The agreements, he said, "demonstrated that we are building even more momentum."
Mr. Chernomyrdin closed the news conference with an appeal to Americans to take home the message that the two countries should put behind them the years of mutual mistrust. Waving his fist, he declared, "Tell them there's no need to be afraid of Russia, no reason to fear Russia."
In his last day in Moscow before traveling to St. Petersburg, Mr. Gore also sought to help Lubavitcher Jews in their long struggle to get the Russia State Library to release 12,000 sacred volumes that have been locked up for more than 70 years.
 
Sending a Book to Brooklyn
 After Mr. Gore examined several volumes at what was once called the Lenin Library, Yevgeny Y. Sidorov, the Culture Minister, gave him one volumes as "a token of good will and a step in the right direction."
Mr. Gore turned the book over to Rabbi Baruch Shlomo Cunin, who plans to fly to New York on Friday to deliver it to Menachem M. Schneerson, the Rebbe of Lubavich, who presides over the Hasidic sect from his headquarters in Brooklyn.
"This is a wonderful humanitarian gesture," Mr. Gore said, "and I am grateful for it."
The Vice President, who had pressed for release of the books when he was a Senator, said that talks on the collection were continuing and that he believed they would lead "toward a successful resolution."
 
Gazing Into Outer Space
 Most of Mr. Gore's visit was devoted to meetings with Mr. Chernomydrin, and much of the focus has been on space exploration.
In addition to assigning Russians to United States shuttles, one agreement calls for four or more American astronauts to spend 24-day stints aboard the Mir space station launched by Russia.
The United States is to pay the Russian space agency up to $400 million through 1997 for materials and other services for their joint ventures.
In another show of support, Mr. Gore went to the Russian space operations center when he arrived this week and spoke to a Russian astronaut in orbit. The astronaut, who has been on Mir for 166 days, told Mr. Gore: "We're looking forward to working together with the United States astronauts when they come aboard."
 
Expressions of Confidence
 Mr. Gore and Mr. Chernomyrdin brushed aside the notion that the political turmoil in Russia could endanger Moscow's ability to fulfill its promises. Mr. Gore also rejected criticism by some experts in the United States that Russian launch facilities are in disrepair, saying, "We have every confidence that we will succeed."
Among the agreements signed today were these:
*A commitment to a joint United States-Russian technology center, scheduled to open in Tyumen in June, to improve the Russian oil and gas industry.
*A pledge by Russia to improve the safety of its older nuclear reactors and to join the United States in examining alternative energy sources.
*A treaty to limit the taxes paid by United States investors in Russia, which is intended to expand business.
Mr. Chernomyrdin and Mr. Gore met in Washington in September to pave the way for some of the agreements signed today. Mr. Chernomyrdin plans to return to Washington next year for further talks.

HEADLINE: Drug Spotlight Falls on an Unblinking Cali Cartel

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CALI, Colombia

 BODY:
When radio bulletins flashed the news of Pablo Escobar's death, residents of this city celebrated with caravans of horn-tooting cars. White flags flew from pharmacies owned by a prominent Cali cocaine-trafficking family.
Indeed, there is little doubt that the Cali cartel aided the Government in its drive against Mr. Escobar, leader of the rival Medellin trafficking ring, who was killed by the police on Dec. 2. 
 "Hey, we helped the Government with intelligence," said a man who identified himself as a midlevel member in the Cali cartel, asserting that the cartel "paid $5 million every two months to the Pepes," a death squad that hunted Mr. Escobar before he was killed.
The death of Mr. Escobar cemented the ascendancy of the Cali smugglers, who now control 75 percent of Colombia's cocaine and heroin exports. The Cali group is led by the brothers Miguel and Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela, but they are more loosely knit than the group run by Mr. Escobar. And because they have preferred bribes over bullets, the Cali smugglers have operated with relative impunity while the Government battled it out with the bloodthirsty Medellin traffickers.
 
Attention Switches to Cali
 But with the Medellin group largely dismantled, world attention has suddenly swiveled 200 miles south to Cali, long a quiet city set on the Cauca River in the green foothills of the Andes.
Cesar Gaviria, Colombia's President, vowed, "Not only the Cali cartel, but all the cartels have to know that our state has a firm policy of fighting drug trafficking and that we are going to persist."
The United States Ambassador to Colombia, Morris D. Busby, announced on national television: "Pablo Escobar's death and the dismantling of the Medellin cartel are great successes for Colombia. But now they should continue with the Cali cartel."
[On Dec. 15, the United States Embassy in Bogota announced that about 120 United States Army engineers were to arrive in Colombia in late December for a 10-week construction project on Malaga Bay, about 60 miles northwest of Cali.
[An embassy spokesman said the project, which calls for repairing roads and building a school and a hospital, "should have absolutely nothing to do with the proximity of the Cali cartel." But Colombian radio reports on the announcement spoke of the impending arrival of "gringo troops," and a newspaper wondered about a "U.S.A. Invasion."]
 
Deals Are in the Air
 Faced with this unwelcome new attention, leading traffickers no longer appear in restaurants and discotheques here, and have instructed their lawyers to speed up negotiations for deals, under a new penal code approved in November, that would legalize their multimillion-dollar fortunes in return for surrender and a few years in a local prison or under house arrest.
Several cartel leaders have said they want to pave the way for their Harvard- and Stanford-educated children to become legitimate business leaders. But many people are skeptical that the families will abandon the $25 billion a year cocaine business.
"No one is about to give it up," the midlevel trafficker said, talking on the condition that he not be identified by name. "Cali controls the markets. They have got planes, cocaine routes, big protection costs. Nobody believes that they are going to give up the business."
Many doubt that the Government will try hard to force them to give up. President Gaviria shows no sign of shifting to Cali the 3,000-strong military and police unit that was used to hunt Mr. Escobar in Medellin. Colombian society does not appear to have the stomach for a repeat of the frontal attack on the Medellin traffickers, a war that cost thousands of dead since 1989.
Decriminalization of cocaine, once a taboo topic, has been advocated in recent weeks by a series of Colombian notables: Gustavo de Greiff, the Attorney General; Antonio Navarro Wolf, a left-wing presidential candidate, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the Nobel Prize-winning Colombian novelist.
 
Cartel Controls the City
 Should it choose to attack, the Government faces a formidable foe.
"The Cali cartel is bigger than anyone gives it credit," an American drug expert said in Bogota. "Their political and economic influence is unprecedented. They have complete control of the city. They have bought the majority of the cops. If the cabdrivers at the airport see anyone suspicious, they call a special number and get several thousand pesos. There isn't a politician in the Valle del Cauca who isn't on the payroll or intimidated."
The self-described midlevel trafficker agreed. "It's a paradise for narcos here," the 32-year-old cartel veteran said as he took a visitor on an impromptu tour of the city. "The police and the airport are bought."
The cocaine business is so widely tolerated that a visiting reporter needs nothing more than a telephone to set up an appointment with a drug trafficker, in this case a gregarious man who enjoyed showing off his English.
Shaving red lights as he rocketed down Roosevelt Avenue in a big American sedan, he pointed out neon-lit shopping centers, new high-rises and luxury car dealerships -- all investments by gang leaders eager to build legitimate business empires. "It's starting to look like Miami, isn't it?" he said.
Construction cranes and boxy buildings are rapidly reshaping the skyline of a city of orange roofs that for four centuries was the genteel preserve of cotton, coffee and sugar cane baronies. Last year, Cali, with one-third of Bogota's population of six million, matched the capital in new construction.
On Sixth Avenue, traffic slowed to a crawl as luxury four-wheel-drive vehicles with tinted windows cruised past flashy new discos, like the three-story, lime green Latin Palace.
"You have 1,000 boys worth over $50 million," the driver said.
 
'Then They Shoot You'
 Called traquetos after the sound of a machine pistol, the younger gang lords are insecure millionaires. They demand instant respect.
"You see a nice car, it must be a mafioso, so you stay back," said the guide, an employee of an older, more established drug trafficking house. "The traquetos are very dangerous. You're sitting in a disco, and they say, 'Why are you looking at my girl?' Then they shoot you."
Traquetos have been known to sweep into a disco and announce that they will pick up everyone's tab. There is one proviso: no one can leave the premises before they do. Sometimes they stay for more than a day.
Traditionally known for its civility, Cali registered 1,268 murders in the first nine months of this year, just shy of Bogota's level. To cool the murder rate, the Mayor declared that all pistol permits were invalid from dusk to dawn on weekends. Enforced with police and army checkpoints, the program has cut the average number of weekend murders in half, to 14.
Repeatedly waved through army checkpoints during three hours of cruising the town, the guide had no worries about the authorities.
"A retired army lieutenant does our security," he said. "He knows which police officer has received how much, whose wife has received a new car."
"When the heat gets too strong, the police call the Rodriguez Orejuelas and say, 'We have to hit some labs,' " he said. "They pull out the drugs. There never is a big seizure in Valle."
 
A Nervous Moment
 Free of police worries, the tour guide showed genuine nervousness only once during an evening of horn-honking, lane-cutting driving.
Toward midnight, he was cruising Ciudad Jardin, an exclusive suburban neighborhood where winking Christmas lights festooned front yards. As he approached the 10-foot-high floodlit walls that hid from public view one of the Rodriguez Orejuela residences, he accelerated and sped past .
"They have their own patrol cars," he said. "It's best not to attract attention."
Cali authorities believe that the United States is unfairly targeting their city.
"Why don't Americans start looking for the California cartel, or the New York cartel?" asked Carlos Holguin Sardi, Governor of Valle del Cauca State, of which Cali is capital. "There is no drug trade, no refining and no transportation from Valle."
Others acknowledge that cocaine trafficking accounts for part of the state's $7 billion economy, but they insist that it is a small part.
"We have recorded half a century of steady economic growth in Valle,"said Fabio Rodriguez Gonzalez, president of the Cali Chamber of Commerce.
 
A Threat Brings Yawns
 Valle has factories from 40 multinational companies, a stock exchange that is second only to Bogota's, and a Pacific Ocean port, Buenaventura, that handles 60 percent of Colombia's legitimate foreign trade.
But with Cali's clandestine cocaine industry injecting hundreds of millions of dollars into the local economy every year, it is hard to find a voice here advocating radical action against it.
A few days after Mr. Escobar's death, Octavio Vargas Silva, the police general who directed the manhunt, publicly warned leaders of the Cali cartel to surrender "or suffer the same fate as Pablo Escobar."

HEADLINE: South Korea Changes Premiers Over Rice Protest

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SEOUL, South Korea, Dec. 16

 BODY:
Accelerating a drive for reform that has shaken the Government, President Kim Young Sam dismissed his Prime Minister today and replaced him with a former Supreme Court justice.
The reform efforts, in which Mr. Kim has taken on some of the country's most powerful institutions, have been little noticed outside South Korea, largely because they have been overshadowed by the showdown with North Korea over its nuclear program. 
 The new Prime Minister, Lee Hoi Chang, has become a popular figure in South Korea by leading an investigation into a corruption scandal that eventually forced some of the nation's military leadership to resign.
The ostensible reason for the dismissal of Prime Minister Hwang In Sung was the Government's highly unpopular decision to open South Korea's rice market as part of the world trade deal announced this week. Mr. Kim had repeatedly vowed never to allow foreign rice into the country, and his reversal prompted street protests.
Mr. Hwang said today that he was being sacrificed in an effort to quell the public outcry over the rice issue, which many South Koreans believe is far more important than North Korea's nuclear ambitions.
The Prime Minister's post in South Korea commands little real authority, but Mr. Hwang was considered something of a holdover from the military-backed Governments that ran South Korea for nearly three decades until Mr. Kim was elected a year ago. The choice of the 58-year-old Mr. Lee, officials said, was intended to signal that the Government's attack on corruption and the financial system will continue.
Mr. Kim's entire Cabinet offered to resign today, a traditional gesture when a new Prime Minister is appointed. And although Government officials said that several ministers with economic portfolios will likely be replaced, Mr. Kim was expected to retain the key ministers involved in the sensitive talks with North Korea and the United States over inspections of the North's suspected nuclear sites.
The new Prime Minister may in fact end up in a critical role in the continuing negotiations with North Korea. It is usually the Prime Minister, rather than South Korea's President, who negotiates with North Korean officials.
Mr. Lee had served as the head of the Board of Audit and Inspection, until this year a relatively powerless group within the South Korean Government. But as soon as Mr. Kim was elected, he began an investigation into charges that the military had sought bribes from defense contractors in return for awarding lucrative contracts that were part of a major expansion of South Korea's military capability.
By July, Mr. Lee had worked with prosecutors to arrest two former Defense Ministers and some senior uniformed officers. At one point the investigation seemed likely to engulf two former South Korean Presidents, Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae Woo, both of whom were questioned. But no legal action was taken against either.
Mr. Lee's investigation made him one of South Korea's most popular figures, and the inquiry was considered remarkable in a country that just a few years ago openly wondered if the military would again seek to take power.
"This time the military could do nothing," a former senior Government official said. "There were no vacuums to fill, no way to claim that the country was being saved from chaos."
In another case Mr. Lee took on the powerful National Security Planning Agency, once known as the Korean Central Intelligence Agency, for exaggerating North Korea's alleged threat to flood Seoul by releasing millions of gallons of water stored by a so-called "Peace Dam" just above the North Korean border.
The warnings led to a huge project to build a compensating dam system that would contain or divert the water. Mr. Lee determined that much of the work was motivated by companies seeking Government contracts, rather than a real threat of flooding.
Based partly on those findings and partly on his suspicions of the intelligence agency that date back to his own years as an opposition leader, Mr. Kim has significantly scaled back the group's power and budget.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Panel Calls for Wide Economic Reform

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 16

 BODY:
An advisory commission to Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa called today for wide-ranging reform of the Japanese economy, including lifting of regulations, increased spending on public works, development of an information superhighway, a cut in income taxes and renewed efforts to reduce Japan's towering trade surplus.
A basic theme of the commission's report, which is supposed to serve as a blueprint for Japan's economic development over the next few years, is that Japan must rely less on exports for future growth and more on greater spending within Japan to improve people's living standards. Many of the measures recommended by the commission have long been advocated by the United States and Japan's other trading partners. 
 But while the report was considered broad, it also lacked specifics, prompting the Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan's leading newspapers, to conclude that the document "lacks power as a new prescription for the Japanese economy." And there are doubts about the extent to which the recommendations will be implemented.
Yotaro Kobayashi, chairman of the Fuji Xerox Company and a member of the commission, said he expected that the report would have "a very important impact on how Japan's economy will proceed in the years to come."
But he added that how influential it will ultimately be "will depend very much on how long Mr. Hosokawa's Government will last."
The Prime Minister, who has made improving the lot of Japan's consumers one of his platforms, is presiding over a shaky coalition Government that almost splintered this week over his decision to partly open the nation's rice market to imports.
He must still achieve reform of Japan's corruption-tainted electoral system and a new economic stimulus package. The current session of Parliament will be extended until the end of January to give him a chance to achieve those goals.
The Advisory Group for Economic Restructuring, as the commission is called, is headed by Gaishi Hiraiwa, chairman of the Keidanren, Japan's most powerful business lobbying organization. Appointed by Mr. Hosokawa, the commission has been meeting since September and issued a preliminary report in November calling for the elimination or easing of nearly 500 regulations.
Today's final report incorporates the deregulation recommendations but covers many other topics as well.
One new issue was the recommendation of an income tax cut of unspecified size in the near future to try to jolt Japan's economy out of its stubborn recession. Although the committee was charged with looking at medium- and long-term reform of the economy, it said there would be little point in talking about the long term unless Japan could escape from its short-term difficulties.
A United States official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the report "lays out a positive agenda, a reformist agenda that we think is moving in the right direction." But he added that "it depends on a strong government" to carry out the reforms.
Gerard Legris, a spokesman for the European Community's mission in Tokyo, also praised the report's direction, but said, "What we are looking for is not a list of intentions but assurance that they will be implemented."
Japan's powerful Government bureaucrats are resistant to deregulation that would weaken their control over business activity. Mr. Kobayashi of Fuji Xerox said bureaucrats were partly responsible for the report's being watered down so that, for instance, there are no figures as to how much taxes should be cut or how much public works spending should be increased.
The new report in some ways echoes a 1986 report that was also supposed to serve as a blueprint for the transformation of Japan's economy from being export-oriented to being driven by domestic demand. But many of the recommendations of the the 1986 document were not carried out. That was in part because a boom in the late 1980's removed some of the impetus for economic reform.

HEADLINE: Nantes Journal;
Unhappily, a Port Confronts Its Past: Slave Trade

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NANTES, France

 BODY:
Along the quays of the Loire, fine mansions speak of the time when Nantes was a great port that loomed large in France's colonial history.
Behind the pilasters and wrought-iron balconies lived the shipbuilders and sea captains who, local lore has it, bravely crossed the Atlantic and returned with precious produce from French possessions in the Americas. But few people here knew -- or chose to remember -- why exactly Nantes became so rich. 
 Breaking a taboo, the city has mounted an exhibition showing that its past wealth came largely from running slaves from Africa to the New World. So proficient was its fleet that Nantes became France's largest port and chief slave trader.
In the 18th century and well into the 19th, Nantes alone launched some 1,800 expeditions to buy African captives, hauling more than 500,000 men and women to the Americas. Slave ships from this port frequently sold their human cargo in Haiti, where plantation owners were often from Nantes, but they also dropped anchor elsewhere in the Caribbean and on the Louisiana coast.
Facing this painful past has not been easy for Nantes. "This exhibit had a hard time starting," said Marie Helene Juzeau, its present curator. "It seemed too sensitive, too difficult."
 
200,000 See Exhibit
 From 1984, plans were blocked by a conservative Mayor and prominent local families, including descendants of the slavers, who said the exhibition would stir no interest and only give the city a bad name. But three years ago a new Socialist Mayor agreed to finance the project.
Nearly 200,000 people have already come to the castle of the Dukes of Brittany where the exhibit opened a year ago. Now the city has decided to extend it until May 29.
Several other European cities are confronting their slavers' past, which schoolbooks have commonly glossed over. Le Havre, France, and Liege, Belgium, had exhibits on slave trading -- though modest ones -- in 1986 and 1989 respectively. In Britain, Liverpool, which became Europe's dominant slave-trading city in the 18th century, is preparing a large permanent exhibit on slavery to open next year.
 
A Triangular Trade
 At Nantes, documents, drawings and objects convey how the slave business operated here and how this and many other European cities profited from what became known as "the triangular trade." (The same ships carried European goods to Africa, exchanged them for slaves, took the slaves to the Americas and returned to Europe loaded with sugar, tobacco, coffee, cacao and other tropical produce.)
The exhibit explains how a Nantes shipowner, to spread his risks, would often sell shares in a "slaving expedition." The money raised would finance the crew, food needed on board and cargo destined for the tribal rulers of Africa's west coast who sold the slaves to the traders.
Records of the African-bound cargo are ample and typically include guns, alcohol, beads and textiles, to be bartered for slaves. Some documents include "useful tips," like what gifts were expected by African kings before they would even agree to discuss business.
Sometimes transactions are recorded in great detail, like those between a Nantes trader and King Pepel of Bany in the Niger delta. On May 20, 1790, the trader, for example, bought a female slave from the King for many items, including 2 cloths, 3 guns, 20 knives, a bowl, 4 hats, 4 chains.
Some documents also hint at the cruelty of the operation. One notes that plenty of drinking water was needed on board to preserve the lives of the human cargo. But once the hold of a slave ship was full and it set off across the ocean, documents note, conditions were often so bad that 10 to 20 percent of the 300 or more slaves might die on the journey. Upon arrival, the trader could get up to five times the price he paid for a captive in Africa.
 
Trade Spawns Own Economy
 In Nantes and elsewhere in Europe, the slave trade spawned its own economy. From 1707 to 1847, records show, 3,829 slaving "expeditions" left from France alone. They generated vast business for shipyards, timber merchants, rope and sail makers. Glassmakers in Bohemia and Venice sold masses of beads and other trinkets destined for barter. Smiths made chains, shackles, spiked collars and other instruments to control the slaves. Manufacturers produced guns and ammunition for the traders and for barter in Africa.
Textiles to pay for slaves became so important, the exhibit notes, that in 1780 Nantes had more than 10 textile mills, employing 4,500 workers.
One ship of slaves could yield up to three or four shiploads of coffee, sugar, indigo, cacao, cotton -- produced by slave labor. Back in Nantes, as elsewhere in Europe, this cargo spawned sugar, chocolate, textile mills. Because of this economic web, Nantes kept trading slaves clandestinely for almost 20 years after France banned it in 1817. Yet a 12-volume history of Nantes published in 1843 devotes just one page to slavery.
A number of African officials have visited the Nantes show and asked for it to travel to West Africa. But when Nantes asked if it would interest Bordeaux, another important slave-trading city, it was given short shrift. More interested in its links with wine, Bordeaux said: no thanks.

GRAPHIC: Photo: Nantes has confronted a painful part of its past. Much of the wealth of the French port was earned running slaves from Africa to the New World, and an exhibit, which has been extended into spring, traces the trade. Among the artifacts are friezes of African faces that adorned merchants' mansions. (Marlise Simons/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: Roles Shifted For Deputies By Giuliani

BYLINE: By STEVEN LEE MYERS

 BODY:
Shuffling his deputies' powers even before he becomes Mayor, Rudolph W. Giuliani announced yesterday that he would broaden the duties of Ninfa Segarra, now a member of the Board of Education, putting her in charge of New York City's vast array of health agencies and social services.
The announcement of Ms. Segarra's expanded portfolio as a deputy mayor came as Mr. Giuliani appointed Fran Reiter to be the third of what will ultimately be four deputy mayors. He said Ms. Reiter, the chairwoman of the state's Liberal Party, would be in charge of planning and community relations, assuming some of the duties that Mr. Giuliani had assigned to Ms. Segarra only two weeks ago. 
"What I said at the time that I appointed Ninfa was all of these things were subject to change, based upon the other people we appointed," Mr. Giuliani said at a news conference at his transition headquarters in Manhattan. "So there really is no change at all."
 
Welfare and Foster Care
 Ms. Segarra will now oversee not only Mr. Giuliani's education policies but presumably also the city's Departments of Health, Youth Services and Aging, as well as the sprawling Human Resources Administration, which runs the welfare and foster-care systems.
In a city where more than 1 million residents receive some form of public assistance, health and social welfare are among the most significant and pressing issues facing Mr. Giuliani, particularly given the billion-dollar gaps he most close in the city's budget.
The expanded duties of Ms. Segarra drew immediate criticism from women's organizations and gay groups, particularly those angered by her views as a member of the conservative majority on the Board of Education that ousted Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez amid disputes over the distribution of condoms and lessons about AIDS.
"I'm scared about what this means for the AIDS crisis, which is the biggest health issue facing the city," said Denny Lee, a spokesman for Act Up, an AIDS protest group that staged an early-morning protest yesterday outside Mr. Giuliani's apartment on the Upper East Side. "She's not going to be healthy for the city."
With the appointments of Ms. Segarra, Ms. Reiter and Peter J. Powers, whom Mr. Giuliani has made his top deputy, the Mayor-elect has now assembled the core of his cabinet. So far, he has appointed three deputies who have virtually no experience in municipal government.
Mr. Giuliani said he would soon announce the last deputy mayor, to oversee finance and economic development. At that time, he said, he will provide a breakdown of agencies that fall under each of the four deputies.
The division of duties -- vital to the efficiency of City Hall and something over which Mr. Giuliani has often criticized Mayor David N. Dinkins -- has been discussed at some length by Mr. Giuliani and his aides as he assembles his administration.
Ms. Reiter, who as deputy campaign manager often acted as Mr. Giuliani's liaison to women and gay organizations, had been under consideration to take over the administration of the city's health agencies and social services.
Ms. Reiter said the discussions over who would be in charge of what continued through Wednesday. Mr. Powers said the division of duties had been "evolving over the last few days."
Mr. Giuliani said that in dividing the roles of his deputies, he was mindful of his pledge to reduce the size of his City Hall and that he expected "four deputy mayors will be doing the work of six" -- the number who now serve under Mayor Dinkins.
While commissioners are in charge of the day-to-day operations of the city's various agencies, deputy mayors have responsibility over broad areas of programs and policies. A deputy mayor's power, though, depends at least in part on his or her relationship with the Mayor.
 
'A Better Arrangement'
 "We decided that a better arrangement, given the talents and interests and the direction in which we wanted to see the city go, would be to give Ninfa the responsibility for what is a very major area of the city, of the city's budget," Mr. Giuliani said. "And therefore it made more sense for Fran to have responsibility in the community-relations areas."
Ms. Segarra, who is 43 and a lawyer, has served in a number of positions in city government since 1977, including as legal counsel to the Mayor's Office for the Handicapped and as executive director of the Voter Assistance Commission.
But she has little experience in managing a huge bureaucracy like the one Mr. Giuliani has assigned to her. Asked if he was worried about the relative inexperience of his three deputies, Mr. Giuliani replied with a smile, "Do I look worried?"
Mr. Giuliani expressed confidence in Ms. Segarra's ability to shove the city's health and social services in a new direction. "There are a lot of directions we want to go that are different than the current administration," he said.
The Mayor-elect demurred, however, when asked about specific changes he expected. Asked about the program of providing clean needles to drug addicts to combat the spread of AIDS, which Mr. Dinkins first opposed but later instituted, Mr. Giuliani repeated his opposition but said that he, as Mr. Dinkins had, would rethink it after a study of its viability.
Diane H. Welsh, president of New York City chapter of National Organization for Women, expressed concern that Ms. Segarra had not been involved in a broad range of issues involving health and social services and that her role would be "solely to cut programs that will be desperately needed." She added, "I don't think she'll be very sympathetic to a large range of concerns that have been raised in this city."
Ms. Reiter, who is 39 and has worked as a television marketing consultant for 15 years, will be responsible for the Department of Parks and Recreation, the Department of City Planning and the Community Development Agency, which distributes Federal poverty grants.
 
An Uncertain Fate
 Another agency that Ms. Reiter will oversee is the city's Human Rights Commission, which Mr. Giuliani has indicated might face elimination as an unnecessary replication of the role of the state's Human Rights Commission. The agency's possible elimination or consolidation, Mr. Giuliani said, is "one of the areas, along with many, many others" being studied by committees reviewing the city's agencies for him.
City Councilman Charles Millard, a Republican and Giuliani supporter who received Liberal Party backing, praised Ms. Reiter's appointment, saying she would prove an asset to the new Mayor in his dealings with an overwhelmingly Democratic Council.
"As the chairwoman of the Liberal Party, she can build bridges between Republicans and Democrats," he said. "Many Democrats in the Council don't owe anything to Rudy, but they owe things to her."
At yesterday's news conference, Mr. Giuliani also named Nydia Negron, a former television reporter, to be deputy press secretary, serving under Cristyne Lategano.

HEADLINE: Texas Lawyers to Vote on How Far Their Ads Can Go

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Dec. 16

 BODY:
In his most talked-about television advertisement, Brian Loncar is sitting at what appears to be his office desk. "If you've been injured in a car accident, do what hundreds of people have already done: bring your troubles to me," Mr. Loncar declares. An "800" number flashes on the screen. Then a car comes crashing through the ceiling above Mr. Loncar, smashing his balsa wood desk to smithereens.
"I'm attorney Brian Loncar and I can help," he continues, reaching under the wreckage for a telephone. "Hurt in a car accident? Haven't gotten your check yet? Call me." 
 Only the most reclusive resident of Dallas could possibly have missed the advertisement, which was broadcast some 800 times on five local television stations earlier this year. In local airwaves saturated with the sound of lawyers peddling their wares, Mr. Loncar is the undisputed sultan of salesmanship, spending nearly $500,000 a year on ads. But if the Texas legal establishment has its way, his flamboyant commercials and those of his competitors will soon become extinct.
Monday afternoon marks the deadline for Texas's 57,326 lawyers to vote in an unusual referendum. The question before them is whether to place restrictions on lawyer advertising, electronic and print, including bans on actors, jingles, dramatizations, pie-in-the-sky promises and appeals to the emotions.
Hardly anything is more quintessentially American than lawyers and advertising. But 16 years after the United States Supreme Court ruled that lawyers have a constitutional right to market themselves, the debate over their advertising continues to rage with surprising ferocity, particularly among lawyers themselves. Neither in its 1977 ruling nor in several subsequent decisions has the High Court pinpointed what is permissible. Texas is only one of several states still trying to draw the line.
 
Ads Have Grown Tame
 Though it may be hard to believe, lawyer advertising has grown more tame over time. Gone are the criminal defense lawyers impersonating death row inmates lamenting their choice of counsel, or divorce lawyers taking chain saws to furniture. But according to William E. Hornsby, staff counsel to the American Bar Association's Commission on Advertising, two-thirds of the states have re-evaluated their rules in the past three years. Half of those have either adopted or are considering curbs.
The restrictions take a variety of forms. Several states now require disclaimers, stating either that the decision to hire a lawyer should not be based solely on an advertisement, or that a lawyer's past success does not guarantee future victories. Some states ban the use of celebrities, at least when they are not real clients. Georgia prohibits instrumental music; Mississippi insists that lawyers touting their "juris doctor" degrees disclose that every lawyer has one.
The Texas proposal would amend the state's disciplinary rules to bar advertisements "likely to create an unjustified expectation" about results or that boast of a lawyer's superiority to others, unless he can prove it. Most important, it provides that all advertising "shall be presented without appeals primarily to emotion." That would presumably eliminate jail doors slamming shut, sirens wailing, horns honking, tires screeching, cars crashing, glass breaking and medical equipment beeping, though such questions would be for a new "lawyer advertisement and solicitation review committee" to ponder.
Here as elsewhere, the debate is impassioned, filled with talk of free speech, consumer protection, protectionism, professionalism and taste.
The campaign, which has gone into high gear since ballots were mailed last month, has exposed several fissures in the profession: between older and younger lawyers, established and upstart lawyers, rural and urban lawyers, plaintiffs' and defense lawyers, richer and poorer lawyers, nostalgic and realistic lawyers, corporate lawyers in large, conservative law firms and knots of lawyers in personal injury or criminal practices.
At first blush, the balance of forces on the referendum could not seem more lopsided. Standing behind the measure is the cream of the Texas legal establishment, including the State Bar of Texas, the Texas Trial Lawyers Association, the Texas Young Lawyers Association, the Texas Association of Defense Counsel and the bar associations of Houston and Dallas. Just about the only group against it is Texans Against Censorship, an ad hoc organization to which Mr. Loncar and other lawyer-advertisers belong.
But in this contest, Goliath appears to be the underdog. Whatever the vote on the merits, the referendum is null and void unless a majority of the lawyers in the state participate in it. The question everyone is asking, then, is not how many lawyers will vote for the new restrictions but how many lawyers will vote, period.
As of noon today, only 42.53 percent of the state's lawyers had sent their ballots to the State Bar in Austin. This is despite furious campaigning by the State Bar's current president, Lonny Morrison of Wichita Falls; a telephone bank set up by the Young Lawyers, and reminder cards sent to recalcitrant members by the State Bar, which offered replacement ballots to anyone who had tossed out the original.
"Everyone knows lawyers put things off to the very last minute," Mr. Morrison said. "But as of this moment, we're essentially 4,900 votes short, and unless something startling should develop, that's a lot of ballots to think will flutter in Friday and Monday. There's a good bit of apathy, I regret to say."
Supporters of the restrictions believe that a few cheesy ads have inflamed public antipathy toward the entire profession. "Some lawyers advertise their services as if they were the latest deodorant on the market or the newest detergent," Mr. Morrison said. "It makes us look hungrier than is consistent with our professional responsibilities." And if the lawyers of Texas do not get their own house in order and bring their own miscreants to heel, he and others add, the State Legislature gladly will.
Those who oppose restrictions counter that it is not the public that is upset with their commercials, but other lawyers. According to Mr. Loncar, these include lawyers for insurance companies; small-town lawyers losing clients to big-city advertisers and trial lawyers too cheap, hidebound or unimaginative to advertise themselves.
In its campaign literature, Texans Against Censorship has called the proposed changes "elitist, Neanderthal and self-serving." The ban on emotion-mongering has it especially upset. "When censors train their cross hair on advertising's ability to attract attention, they aim at the ads' effectiveness, not its deceptiveness," the group states. "The censors' furtive mission is to make advertising so meaningless that it won't work, to effectively silence those who dare to break tradition and overtly compete."
Mr. Loncar concedes that some lawyer advertising is undignified, but says that with a variety of negative images of lawyers being portrayed, restricting advertisements is not going improve the public's perception of the Bar.
If the proposal dies, however, the mortal blow may have been delivered by the state's largest law firms. Though marginally affected by the measure -- they would have to submit even their usually discrete, written solicitations for approval -- it has little emotional or economic relevance for them. The management at one of Houston's largest law firms, Vinson & Elkins, urged its lawyers to vote for the restrictions, but did not press the point. Turnout is far higher in outlying areas, like Lubbock and Amarillo, than in Dallas, Houston or Austin.
"People here are not terribly worked up one way or another," said Thomas P. Marinis Jr., a partner at Vinson & Elkins.
One need only watch television for an hour or so on any given morning (when lawyer-advertisers figure that the injured parties they seek are home sick) to see how prevalent lawyer advertising has become. Between the relentless cheeriness of "Happy Days" and "Laverne and Shirley" reruns on channel 11 in Dallas, for instance, marches a parade of accident victims, scofflaws, criminal suspects and assorted ordinary people -- or actors masquerading as them -- singing their lawyers' praises.
*A Sylvester Stallone look- and sound-alike glowers from behind bars. "If you're arrested for an outstanding ticket, you're probably in serious trouble, which means you need serious help, like attorney John L. Corn at 38-LEGAL," he says.
*A couple agonizes over a wrecked car, medical bills and collection letters. "I'm calling R. A. Gabriele," the husband declares, referring to a Dallas lawyer famed for sending flowers to his clients. "It's time we had someone on our side."
*"Jim Adler. He makes drunk drivers pay," states another announcer seconds later.
*A man washing his car holds up a settlement check and hails Jeff Slakter, "the attorney who cares."
*"For personal injury, call 748-0503," a woman sings.
After appeals from legal consortiums like "The Injury Health Line" and 1-800-722-LAWYER, comes the inescapable Mr. Loncar, who also advertises in The Dallas Morning News, the Yellow Pages and Howard Stern's radio program.
 
As Saying Goes, It Pays . . .
 Together, the advertisements have helped make the 33-year-old Mr. Loncar prosperous far beyond his years. His assets, he says, include two Mercedes, a $400,000 home and $500,000 in the bank; his office is several architectural cuts above the seedy digs of his competitors, including Mr. Slakter and Mr. Gabriele.
For all their electronic loquaciousness, Mr. Adler, Mr. Gabriele and Mr. Slakter declined to speak with a reporter. That left the talking to Mr. Loncar, who did not shrink from the task.
"People want to be entertained, whether it's selling lawyers or selling soap," he said. "God knows, lawyers are boring enough. If you make it so that all they can do is stand in front of a lot of books and say, 'I'm a lawyer, call me,' people will switch the channels as fast as they can."

HEADLINE: Report Says Filming Is Up By a Third

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
New York City's film and television production industry, which was devastated in 1990 by a Hollywood boycott, appears to have revived this year, the Dinkins administration said in a report yesterday.
The report largely credited the swath of wage reductions and other concessions the craft union accepted after a bitter conflict with Hollywood film makers three years ago. 
 For more than a decade, New York has been losing business to smaller but fiercely aggressive film centers in Canada, Florida, Texas and elsewhere, all of which offer far lower costs. The gap in costs, although narrowing, remains wide.
But this year, the report found, film production in the city soared 38 percent over the depressed level of 1992.
And while yesterday's report was released by a group of economists and film experts on the staff of outgoing Mayor David N. Dinkins it attributed the upturn mainly to changes within the film industry itself, not to city policy.
"The economics of the industry have shifted," said Richard Brick, the city's Commissioner of Film, Theater and Broadcasting. "Suddenly, the playing field has become more level."
Even during the slump in 1992, the report found, film making contributed $3 billion to the city's economy. That included the production of television programs, commercials and industrial films as well as feature films.
 
Jobs for 68,000
 The film industry employs 68,000 who work in New York City, or 2.6 percent of its private work force. According to the report, the infusion into the economy comes through a ripple effect.
"There is a good buzz that things are at least possible in New York, that you can get concessions here," said Barbara DeFina, a Manhattan resident who produced several movies directed by Martin Scorcese, including "Age of Innocence," "Cape Fear" and "Color of Money."
The biggest blow to New York City's film industry, which was already facing intense competition, came in a seven-month boycott of the city by Hollywood production companies that began in November 1990 and did not end until May of 1991. Studio executives, already upset over the high costs and routine headaches of making movies here, abandoned the city amid a labor dispute with New York's film craft union .
After the boycott ended, film production continued to suffer because of the recession.
But amid the downturn, according to yesterday's report and interviews with people in the industry, economic changes have made the city more welcoming to movie and television producers.
 
A New Agreement
 The industry's labor dispute, which led to the 1990 boycott, ended when the East Coast Council of the International Alliance of Theatrical and Stage Employees, which represents craft people here, agreed to accept reduced overtime pay.
Then, in series of amendments to its work rules, the union agreed to pay schedules that varied with the proposed budget of the film to be produced.
Previously, low-budget production companies had to pay their camera people, set designers, truck drivers and other crew members the same wages that a huge production would pay. The union agreed to permit lower wages for small productions provided that they would recoup their concessions in bonus checks if the little movie turned out to make big profits.
"We have created customized work rules," said Louis D'Agostino, executive director of the New York film industry union. Although the new rules were resisted by some crafts people, he said, they have now won wide support not only because they have attracted more production activity, but also because they have provided the film workers with wide creative options.
"Some of the people who left for Hollywood are coming back just because they can work on a $50 million film in one month, then go to work on a $4 million feature that gives them more room for experimentation," he said.
While union rules have changed, suppliers to the film industry -- a broad spectrum including hardware stores, lumber yards, trucking companies, lighting suppliers, caterers and photographic processors ---have lowered their prices.
The report included recommendations for broader city support of film makers. Among them were the use of a venture capital fund, financed partly by the city, to invest in small production companies.
That was proposed during the mayoral campaign by Mayor Dinkins, but would now have to win the approval of Rudolph W. Giuliani.
A smaller proposal in the report was for the city to set aside low-cost office space for film producers, relieving them of the need to hunt for offices when they are on tight production schedules. Another was to assist the film industry in finding a permanent garage for the trucks and lighting equipment that production crews use for work in Manhattan.

HEADLINE: Ford to Build New Compacts At U.S. and Mexican Plants

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Dec. 16

 BODY:
Eager to expand its production capacity and exploit the favorable regulations under the North American Free Trade Agreement, the Ford Motor Company said today that it would build its new compact cars in Mexico, as well as the United States, and greatly increase its exports to Mexico.
Ford's plans will touch off a series of production shifts in Mexican, Canadian and American factories, the company said, resulting in the creation of the equivalent of 550 jobs in the United States and Canada, and 300 jobs in Mexico. Ford projected that the total number of jobs, or "job equivalents," could climb to 6,000 when additional work at its suppliers' plants in the United States and Canada was taken into account, as well as overtime work. 
 The announcement by Ford lends support to the arguments of supporters of the trade pact, who had said the agreement would add jobs, especially for the automobile industry, which has had its opportunities to do business in Mexico severely constrained.
Ed Hagenlocker, executive vice president of North American operations for Ford, said the company's actions proved that the North American accord would benefit the economies of all three countries.
The United Automobile Workers union, which strongly opposed the trade deal, did not respond immediately to the announcement by Ford.
Because Mexico has imposed tariffs of 20 percent on imported vehicles, as well as complex local-content rules, Ford and other auto makers have relied mostly on local manufacturers for their sales.
This year, Ford will export only about 1,500 cars to Mexico from its plants in the United States and Canada, but next year that number is expected to rise to about 25,000. Ford projected that its exports to Mexico would rise to 50,000 by 1996. The auto maker will add the Lincoln Mark VIII and Ford Escort to the list of models it exports to Mexico.
Moreover, Ford and its parts suppliers now may export parts to Ford assembly plants in Mexico at a greatly reduced cost. Next year, the Mexican tariff will decline to 10 percent on cars, and will be eliminated after 10 years. Tariffs on trucks will be eliminated after five years.
The North American trade accord was one important factor in Ford's decision. The other was the very tight capacity at the No. 2 auto maker since the mid-1980's.
Ford said last year that it planned to build the new Mystique and Contour models at its assembly plant in Kansas City, Mo., next year, with a capacity of 250,000 cars annually. But the company said it believed that it could sell more of the models, which will replace the Ford Tempo and Mercury Topaz, if it could find a place to build more. It had been reluctant to build a new assembly plant because of the expense and risk.
The Mexican plant and the reduction of the tariffs on parts neatly solve the problem, said Bert Serre, a spokesman for Ford in Dearborn, Mich., because "we don't believe there's enough demand to justify adding a whole plant with capacity of 250,000 more cars." Ford's assembly plant in Cuautitlan, Mexico, will be able to build about 74,000 Mystiques and Contours a year, about 24,000 for sale in Mexico.
Ford, meanwhile, will transfer the production of a small number of Thunderbirds and Mercury Cougars from that factory in Mexico to its Lorain, Ohio, plant that produces those models.

HEADLINE: October Trade Deficit Narrowed 1.6%

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 16

 BODY:
After deepening through the spring and summer, the United States trade deficit stabilized in October, despite the largest gap with Japan in nearly seven years.
The difference between what Americans sold overseas and what they bought from abroad narrowed by 1.6 percent, to $10.5 billion, the Commerce Department said today. 
 The modest improvement came even though the deficit with Japan jumped 14 percent, to $6.1 billion, the largest since November 1986.
Over all in October, a 3.2 percent increase in exports, to a record $40.1 billion, outpaced a 2.1 percent rise in imports, to $50.6 billion, also a record.
 
Foreign Economies in Slump
 Slumps in Europe and Japan have cut demand for exports, economists said, at the same time that a moderate improvement in the United States economy has increased Americans' appetite for foreign goods.
For the first 10 months of the year, the trade gap is running at an annual rate of $117.8 billion, far exceeding last year's $84.5 billion. That puts the United States on track for its worst trade performance since 1988.
"We will continue to grow faster, so there's probably going to be more trade deterioration in 1994," Bruce Steinberg, an economist for Merrill Lynch, said. "Once you get a more solid recovery taking hold everywhere, you'll begin to see our trade deficit start shrinking again, probably in 1995."
Meanwhile, a separate report from the Labor Department found that 7,000 fewer Americans applied for unemployment benefits last week than the week before.
A seasonally adjusted 330,000 people claimed benefits during the week ended Dec. 11. A less-volatile four-week moving average of claims declined by 2,000, to a nine-week low of 332,000. The numbers were taken as signs of continued, although irregular, improvement in the job market.
Trade was one of the few strong components of the American economy during the 1990-91 recession, but it has turned into an economic drag this year. Still, Mr. Steinberg and other economists pointed to October's slight improvement as a sign that the deficit would not markedly worsen.
 
A "Flattening" Is Seen
 The evidence has been suggesting that "we're getting a flattening," said Robert G. Dederick, an economist for the Northern Trust Company in Chicago. "It's a flattening at a very high number, to be sure, but it's a flattening nevertheless," he added.
The Clinton Administration is promising that the just-signed tariff-slashing pact under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the recently ratified North American Free Trade Agreement will overcome the nation's trade imbalance.
"Accelerating the growth of exports is the best path to improving the balance of trade," Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said. "To achieve this, our trading partners need to stimulate their economies to create growth."
The October gain in exports reflected increases of $447 million in civilian aircraft, $391 million in autos and parts, $181 million in gold, $141 million in telecommunications equipment, $135 million in semiconductors, $133 million in nuclear fuel and $106 million in industrial engines.
The increase in imports reflected an increase of $247 million in autos and parts, $222 million in computer accessories, $151 million in crude oil, $145 million in artwork and antiques and $124 million in fish.

Fleet Unit Settles Claims of Lending Bias

BYLINE: By Bloomberg Business News

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Dec. 16

 BODY:
A unit of Fleet Financial Group Inc. has pledged $100 million in loan refunds and other relief to Georgia customers to settle allegations of discriminatory lending practices by the banking company.
The settlement, which was announced today, is the largest ever involving accusations of discrimination in mortgage lending against members of minorities. 
 Fleet Finance, an Atlanta mortgage lender, pledged between $30 million and $40 million in refunds and lower-rate mortgage loans to the company's 18,300 customers in Georgia. Fleet also agreed to set up a $70 million fund to issue mortgage loans for as low as two percentage points less than prevailing market rates in the next five years.
 
 
'Improper Pursuit of Profits'
 The Georgia Attorney General, Michael J. Bowers, said, "We found, as a result of our investigation, that arrogance and the improper pursuit of profits was to blame."
Fleet Finance, a unit of the nation's 14th-largest bank, did not admit guilt.
In a related move, Fleet Finance said it would pay $18 million to $20 million to settle a class-action lawsuit filed in Augusta, Ga., that accused the bank of selecting black neighborhoods for mortgage loans at annual rates that sometimes exceeded 30 percent.
Today's settlement closes a yearlong state investigation into allegations that Fleet Finance trapped lower-income people in high-rate mortgages. Fleet Finance was accused of lending to people who did not qualify for loans so that it could foreclose on them later and sell the property at a profit.
The loans prompted a rash of consumer complaints and several class-action lawsuits. No charges were filed by the Attorney General.
Under the settlement, Fleet agreed not to charge interest rates that exceed 12 percent above the prime interest rate. Fleet also agreed not to charge prepaid finance charges in excess of 5 percent of the face value of the loan amount. As part of the refund payments, Fleet said it would reduce by as much as half the interest rate charges to some borrowers.
Fleet Finance has offices in 22 states. The parent company, based in Providence, R.I., said the settlement would have no impact on fourth-quarter earnings.

HEADLINE: Fed Rebutted by Bentsen On Bank Regulatory Plan

BYLINE: By SAUL HANSELL

 BODY:
Responding to sharp criticism from the Federal Reserve Board, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen yesterday defended the Clinton Administration's plan to create a single banking regulatory agency and contended that the Fed was merely trying to protect its turf.
"There is no question our proposal will result in the reduction of jobs, saving the taxpayers money," Mr. Bentsen said at a news conference in Manhattan. "Change can be painful for those that want to keep the status quo." 
 The Administration has proposed forming one agency to supervise all banks and savings and loan associations. Banks are now subject to the overlapping authority of the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Under the Clinton plan, the Fed would no longer examine banks, but would remain responsible for conducting monetary policy. It would also continue to serve as the lender of last resort to banks and securities firms, providing the nation's main defense against financial panic.
But the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, and other Fed officials have said that the Federal Reserve's role in bank regulation helps it perform its other duties by giving it more information on bank activities.
"The Fed's arguments fail on numbers alone," Mr. Bentsen said. "The Fed supervises 18 percent of commercial bank assets. It's hard to imagine that the integrity of monetary policy and the stability of the financial system rests on the continued oversight of those banks."
"Most financial crises have nothing to do with banking," he added. "The Fed has nothing to do with securities regulation but it handled the 1987 stock market crash. It never regulated the railroads, but it dealt just fine with the Penn Central bankruptcy. And it never regulated the silver market, but it managed to control the silver market collapse in 1980."
Still, under the Administration's proposal, the Fed would have access to all information gathered by the new agency. "We're looping the Fed in, not out," Mr. Bentsen said. A member of the Fed would be one of the five members of the proposed Federal Banking Commission that would supervise the new agency.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Mark Time

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The bond market did not do very much of anything yesterday except prove how tightly it was locked into an aimless trading range as the end of the year approaches.
Early yesterday, Treasury prices fell and yields rose after a report by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia showing a sharp jump in the bank's index of regional business conditions. In December, the index leaped to 42.4. from 22.4 in November. This jump seems to indicate that the closely watched purchasing managers index could move up to 60, which would indicate another good month for manufacturing. 
 Still, the bond market's reaction to the report was calmer than expected. "Normally that would be worth a point off the price of the bond," said John Ryding, senior economist at Bear, Stearns & Company.
 
Inflation Would Pick Up
 The reason is that such a spurt in manufacturing activity could make traders worry more about a jump in overall growth that would make the pace of inflation pick up. And unlike many other economists, the Bear, Stearns chief economist, Lawrence A. Kudlow, is predicting 4 percent growth in both the fourth quarter of 1993 and the first quarter of 1994. The consensus outlook is for a slowdown in growth in the beginning of next year.
Matthew Alexy, the government trading strategist at CS First Boston, said he was also surprised that the bond market, especially at the long end, did not sell off much on the Philadelphia data. "It's a big number," he said.
In late trading at 5 P.M., the price of the 30-year bond was 9914/32 , down 5/32 as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, inched up to 6.29 percent from 6.28 percent Wednesday. The price of the two-year Treasury note slipped 1/32 as the yield moved to 4.20 percent from 4.18 percent.
 
Firms Back Ban
 The list of municipal bond underwriters that have said they will join the voluntary ban on political contribution is growing. According to the Securities and Exchange Commission, nine new medium- and small-sized firms have endorsed the ban, which prohibits contributions that are made with the intent of winning lucrative underwriting business.
According to the Securities Data Corporation, the 51 companies that have endorsed the ban accounted for 78.6 percent percent of the underwriting business this year, when full credit for each issue is given to the lead manager.
The new companies, which include firms run by women and minorities, are the Artemis Capital Group; Barr Brothers & Company; Craigie Inc.; Griffin, Kubik, Stephens & Thompson; Hanifen, Imhoff; the LaSalle National Bank, E.A. Moos; Samuel A. Ramirez & Company, and William E. Simon & Sons Municipal Securities.
But there are still nine significant firms in the market that account for about 6.7 percent of the underwriting business that have not said whether they will endorse the ban.
 
Prison Issue
 The New York State Urban Development Corporation sold $216 million of bonds yesterday to be used for prison construction.
The sale has been opposed by State Comproller H. Carl McCall, who calls it "backdoor financing" that allows the state to sell bonds without voter approval and uses the bonding authority of the corporation for purposes not originally intended.
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who in the past had approved the use of the corporation's bonding authority for prisons, is also now pushing a revision of the state's debt practices that would prevent such sales. The issue avoids the need for voter approval by depending on the Legislature to appropriate the payments to bondholders each year.
The issue came amid a recent flood of bonds with New York names and may have suffered a bit because of that. The lead underwriter, Merrill Lynch, had to increase the yields on several maturities to attract more buyers. Paul Kuhns, the co-head of municipal bond underwriting, said that the initial pricing was also very aggressive, meaning yields were pushed as low as possible.
The issue due in 2023 was priced to yield 5.786 percent, up from an initial pricing of 5.75 percent. The taxable equivalent yield in the 36 percent tax bracket is 9.04 percent.
The 10-year bonds were priced to yield 5.729 percent, up from an initial pricing of 5.70 percent. The taxable equivalent yield is 8.95 percent. The very small increase in yield between the 10-year maturity and the 30-year maturity is a reason many analysts advise investors to buy intermediate rather then longer-term bonds, which are more volatile and can have a much greater price drop if interest rates rise.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
MCI is expanding its ethnic marketing into long-distance business services.

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
AND now a word from MCI: hola!
The MCI Communications Corporation is making its initial foray into aiming advertising for long-distance business services at ethnic markets. Its efforts, which could include hiring agencies that specialize in ethnic marketing, are intended to complement the ethnically oriented consumer campaigns it already runs as supplements to its general advertising. 
 Since last week, television viewers in Los Angeles and San Francisco have been able to watch a commercial featuring Bita Daryabari, an MCI account representative of Iranian descent. In the commercial, she recounts her success at signing business customers in the San Francisco area's Iranian community. And sometime early next year, MCI plans to introduce a comprehensive communications program in South Florida called "Hola! MCI/Positivamente Miami!" to try to increase its market share among Spanish-speaking owners of businesses there.
"We've done a tremendous amount of ethnic marketing on the consumer side," Kevin Bennis, MCI's senior vice president of marketing for business markets, said in a telephone interview from his office in Atlanta. "But our ethnic marketing to businesses has been only scattered.
"This is our first effort to really do a national business ethnic marketing program," he added. "If these markets are as big of an opportunity as we think, we'll invest behind them."
The decision by MCI to further segment its sales messages is emblematic of the growing importance that mainstream advertisers are placing on ethnic marketing. That is particularly true in intensely competitive product and service categories like telecommunications, soft drinks, beer, banking and fast food.
It has become fashionable to deride attempts to address anyone other than white, Anglo-Saxon males as "politically correct." But the campaigns being sponsored by companies like MCI simply acknowledge demographic trends. One need not wax rhapsodic over gorgeous mosaics or rainbow coalitions to recognize that the complexion of America's population is growing more diverse.
"Someone once made the staggering statement that one in five Americans will be of Hispanic descent by 2015," Mr. Bennis said.
In other words, never mind politically correct. Marketers are trying to be economically correct.
For the "Hola! MCI" program, Mr. Bennis said, MCI will seek proposals from three or four agencies that specialize in marketing to Spanish-speaking consumers. The longtime MCI agency, Messner Vetere Berger McNamee Schmetterer Euro RSCG in New York, which created the spot centering on Ms. Daryabari, will also be asked for a proposal, he added.
If "Hola! MCI" is successful, Mr. Bennis said, he foresees adapting it to other markets with large numbers of businesses owned by Spanish-speaking people, including California, New York and Texas. Nationally, these businesses spend $2 billion annually on long-distance services.
"There's no reason why we can't get 8 percent to 10 percent of that market in the next 24 months with this kind of targeted program," Mr. Bennis said, compared with MCI's current share of "a little higher than 5 percent."
It is too early to estimate MCI's budget for business-market ethnic campaigns, he said, adding that the company's overall 1994 spending on ads aimed at business customers would exceed $50 million.
In adding an ethnic component to its business market advertising, MCI is following its larger rival, the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. A.T.& T. already runs campaigns directed at Spanish-speaking business owners, created by Bravo, a unit of Young & Rubicam Inc. in New York, and at Asian-American business owners, created by Amko Advertising in New York.
At the Sprint Corporation, the No. 3 long-distance carrier behind A.T.& T. and MCI, a review has begun to find an agency to create advertising for its new business services group. J. Walter Thompson San Francisco will remain Sprint's lead agency.

Profits Rise On Property Insurance

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Sharply lower losses from disasters have helped property and casualty insurance companies, which protect against accidents to buildings, cars and people, earn nearly $16 billion after taxes this year, more than double last year's $7.4 billion, the Insurance Information Institute said yesterday.
"The most notable event for insurers in 1993 was actually a nonevent: the much feared son or daughter of Andrew did not appear," said Sean Mooney, senior vice president at the institute, a trade group that is financed by the industry but does not lobby on its behalf. Hurricane Andrew caused about $16.5 billion of losses in Florida last year, making it the most costly disaster ever for insurers. 
 The 1993 profit relied heavily on investment income -- $31.6 billion of interest and dividends and one-time capital gains of $10.7 billion, thanks to rising stock and bond prices. The industry collected $233.7 billion of premiums, incurred losses of $190 billion and had other expenses of $63.3 billion.
 
Underwriting Results Lackluster
 Despite the high level of overall profits, John Snyder, senior vice president at the A. M. Best Company, an insurance rating firm, warns in a separate study to be published soon that for insurance underwriting -- the business of collecting premiums and paying claims -- "overall results are lackluster."
In addition, investment income will fall because of lower interest rates, Mr. Snyder said, and much of the 1993 capital gains came at the expense of future income. For example, companies that sell older, high-interest-rate bonds at a gain will collect less interest in the future than if they still held the bonds.
The companies' financial condition appears stronger now, Mr. Snyder said, because of $3 billion of unrealized capital gains from investments still on their books, but that could be jeopardized by a drop in stock prices. "What comes easy also can disappear easily," he said.
 
Liability Insurance Growing
 Mr. Mooney of the insurance institute noted that liability insurance, which now accounts for nearly 60 percent of premiums collected by property and casualty companies, can be very profitable even if claims payments exceed premiums because the companies can invest the premiums for several years before claims are paid. The growth of liability insurance, he added, makes it unlikely that the property and casualty industry will ever again collect more in premiums than it pays for losses and expenses.
For other lines of property and casualty insurance, high claims are a greater problem because companies have only a short time -- often less than a year -- to invest premiums before claims are paid.
Mr. Snyder said that many lines of personal insurance, such as homeowners' policies, were producing claims and expenses so much greater than premiums that some large companies, which sell through independent agencies and have higher expenses, were pulling back from those businesses.
Losses from catastrophes -- big disasters that usually cost more than $5 million in losses -- totaled $6 billion this year, the third highest ever, but were down from $23 billion a year earlier, the insurance institute said. The year's biggest catastrophes included the March blizzard, which cost $1.8 billion, the Los Angeles fires, $950 million, and the bombing of the World Trade Center, $510 million.

Dollar Eases Against Yen And Slips in Other Trading

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar eased against the yen yesterday after a Government report that the United States trade deficit with Japan hit a seven-year high in October.
It also slipped against European currencies on news that Germany left its interest rates untouched. Investors had been betting on a rate cut in light of Germany's weak economy. 
 In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 109.56 yen, down from 109.78 yen on Wednesday. It also dropped to 1.7105 German marks from 1.7175 marks.
Gold prices fell. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for February delivery, the most active futures contract, dropped $1.50, to $387.50 an ounce.
The United States trade deficit narrowed by less than many economists had predicted, to $10.46 billion in October from a revised $10.62 billion in September.
Moreover, the nation's trade gap with Japan widened to $6.09 billion, from $5.323 billion the prior month. The dollar quickly eased against the yen, since a lower dollar has often been used to combat a high Japanese surplus.
 
 
Trade Figure 'Shock'
 "There was a shock from the trade figure," said Amy Smith, currency analyst at IDEA. "People had expected a widening of the bilateral deficit, but that number was way above expectations."
Later, the market shrugged of Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen's comment that the White House was comfortable with the dollar-yen rate.
News that Germany's money supply grew sharply in November tipped off the market early that the German bank probably would not cut official interest rates at its weekly council meeting, this year's last.
That suspicion was borne out when the Bundesbank said it would hold rates steady.
The dollar declined against the mark after the money supply report as dealers bought back marks sold earlier on the off chance the Bundesbank would ease.
Lower German rates would have made mark-based assets relatively less attractive than investments denominated in other currencies.
The British pound rose in New York to $1.4855, from $1.4788 on Wednesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with Wednesday's quotes, included: 1.4604 Swiss francs, down from 1.4680; 5.8415 French francs, down from 5.8610; 1,689 Italian lire, down from 1,691, and $1.3330 (Canadian), down from $1.3332.

HEADLINE: Review/Architecture;
Isozaki's Designs for an Insecure Postwar World

BYLINE: By HERBERT MUSCHAMP

 BODY:
"Arata Isozaki: Works in Architecture," now on view at the Brooklyn Museum, may put you in mind of Nietzsche's warning against looking too long into the abyss lest the abyss look back into you. A show that begins with a glimpse into the cultural void of postwar Japan gives way to the queasy sensation that the West has also been swallowed up by a nuclear-age vacuum. This is a beautiful show, and it looks terrific in the great big blond galleries Mr. Isozaki has designed with James Stewart Polshek for the Brooklyn Museum's newly renovated West Wing. But a profound malaise lurks beneath the beauty.
Born in 1931 in Oita, Japan, Mr. Isozaki came of age in a country that was not only physically and economically in tatters but had also been torn from its cultural moorings. With its emperor demoted from a god to a figurehead and many of its ancient social customs outlawed by a new constitution, Japan veered toward the condition of a blank cultural slate. It is apt that the country later cornered the market in cameras, tape recorders and VCR's. With its own culture in a state of partial erasure, it is as if Japan had no choice but to fill the vacuum by recording the sights and sounds of the world beyond its borders. 
 This 30-year retrospective suggests that Mr. Isozaki has been the architectural equivalent of a recording machine, a tourist's camera looking to frame the best shots. He started out as a kind of modernist day-tripper. Early Japanese projects, like the City in the Air (1960-63) and the Oita Prefectural Library (1962-66), bear the influence of Le Corbusier, Louis I. Kahn and the British architectural group Archigram, as well of that of Kenzo Tange, Mr. Isozaki's early mentor in Tokyo. Later, as Mr. Isozaki's international career accelerated, his designs absorbed the classical high spots of the traditional European grand tour. The Tsukuba Center Building of 1979 to 1983, for example, visualizes the civic center for a new Japanese town as a stone collage of references to Michelangelo, Borromini and Ledoux.
The paradox is that the West was scarcely better equipped than Japan to offer a firm historical footing to an architect of Mr. Isozaki's generation. In contrast to the 19th century, when Japan's modernization was sustained by Europe's confident view of progress as the fulfillment of history, Mr. Isozaki embarked on his career just as the West was losing its faith in modern progress. Mr. Isozaki's eclectic cribbings are like a mirror held up to that crisis. Unlike those American post-modernists who believed that classicism held the key to a usable past, Mr. Isozaki appeared to understand that no amount of historical excavation could uncover a firm foundation on which to build the present. He perceived that a time that had lost its faith in the future had also lost its grip on the past.
Mr. Isozaki grasped this lesson early on. In 1968, he created a project for the Milan Triennale, called the Electric Labyrinth, in which images of ruined, futuristic cities were projected onto a screen printed with a panoramic view of Hiroshima flattened by the bomb. Although only the screen is included in the Brooklyn show, much of the subsequent work on view could be regarded as a continuation of that early apocalyptic vision. Each building is an image, briefly flashed onto a narrow strip of time between an irretrievable past and an uncertain future. Mr. Isozaki's design for the Tsukuba Center Building, for instance, is not only composed of fragments: it is also depicted in a series of silk-screen prints as a ruin of the future, the skeleton of an expired present.
When Mr. Isozaki uses traditional Western forms, he is not so much appealing to the past as he is embracing a present in which the Japanese have become global explorers. A trip to the Campidoglio in Rome is modernity to him, and so is the use of industrial technology and geometric abstraction. He does not cede the pyramid franchise to I. M. Pei, or the latest high tech to Richard Rogers. And Mr. Isozaki can use traditional forms toward explicitly anti-traditional ends. On a wall panel, he explains that the classical forms of the Tsukuba Center Building were intended as a polemic against the resurgence of Japanese nationalism. Foreign tradition, in other words, becomes a tool for opposing tradition at home.
Mr. Isozaki's eclecticism is double-edged. While refusing to restrict himself to a signature style, he differs from some of his post-modern contemporaries in allowing that esthetic freedom can be a road to triviality. The liberation from modernist orthodoxy is not something to be mindlessly celebrated, and it may even be cause for dread. And the present can be a scary place. The most recent project in the show, Mr. Isozaki's 1992 design for the Nara Convention Hall in Nara, Japan, is an immense black shell that recalls at once the exquisite modeling of ancient pottery and the sleek precision of military hardware. Inside the hall, glass-walled auditoriums blaze with crystal fire, but also with the unearthly brilliance of shattered electrons. In one rendering, the black hall hulks beneath sulfurous yellow skies, perhaps offering shelter from atmospheric pollution, just as possibly adding to it.
Team Disney headquarters, completed in 1990, epitomizes Mr. Isozaki's unsettling synthesis of the malignant and the benign. Straddling an artificial pond in Lake Buena Vista, Fla., the stunning building consists of two long office wings hinged at the center by an immense truncated cone, 120 feet high, that somewhat resembles a nuclear reactor dressed up as a festive party bonbon, an atomic bombe glacee. The cone's windowless interior, bridged by a Piranesian catwalk, is exposed to the sky, while a gigantic stylus protrudes across the mouth, casting shadows on a vast sundial inscribed on the cone's inner wall.
This is perhaps meant to demonstrate ma, a Japanese word signifying the merging of space and time, which was the subject of a traveling exhibition Mr. Isozaki created in 1978. But other, less welcome fusions -- between reality and entertainment; between corporate culture and global politics -- may be taking place in Disney's electric labyrinth, mergers between entities that should perhaps remain visibly distinct. One enters the cone through a tunnel cast in the form of an extruded pair of Mickey Mouse ears. Listen, and you can almost hear the echoes of an infernal laugh track bouncing off the walls as audiences line up to be vaporized by Team Disney: anesthetized by beauty, then quickly tickled to death.
Originally organized by the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, the show is skillfully designed. Such a visually diverse body of work could easily end up looking like a yard sale. Mr. Isozaki has prevented this by devising a display format that presents each project in three parts. A large blue wall panel, accompanied by a single defining image, is inscribed with a text that explains the concept behind each of the 22 projects on view. A group of drawings and prints traces the design development. Wooden scale models display the final design.
The format weaves the projects together in a loose, three-dimensional version of the tartan patterns that occur in Mr. Isozaki's buildings. It also lends cohesion to the galleries themselves. Mr. Isozaki has banished photographs from the main part of the show to an adjoining room, where a high-definition video monitor screens a continuous program of supernaturally crisp color pictures.
"Arata Isozaki: Works in Architecture" remains at the Brooklyn Museum, 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, through Feb. 27.

HEADLINE: Quick Fix at Defense

 BODY:
President Clinton has made a safe and smart choice in nominating retired Adm. Bobby Ray Inman to be his second Secretary of Defense. The national security establishment is already singing the nominee's praises. That has to be music to the ears of a President who may feel vulnerable about his own weak national security credentials.
Admiral Inman would bring a sharp mind, government experience and bipartisan respect to the Pentagon post. A retired four-star admiral and formerly Director of the National Security Agency, Deputy Director of Central Intelligence and chief executive of a private-sector computer consortium, Mr. Inman is known for the kind of management skills the incumbent Secretary, Les Aspin, is said to lack. 
 Senators will want to examine his management record in and out of government and satisfy themselves that his military and intelligence background in no way detracts from his ability to exercise strong civilian control over America's armed forces. Such control is crucial because Admiral Inman will have to plug the $50 billion, five-year defense budget gap that was reportedly the last straw in an increasing tense Clinton-Aspin relationship. That will require establishing a firm hand over the service chiefs, whose requests will need to be scaled back if even a fraction of Mr. Clinton's domestic goals are to be financed.
At the same time, the new Secretary will need to get up to speed quickly on the complex nuclear bargaining now going on with North Korea. And it will be his responsibility to assess the military implications of the rise of aggressive nationalists in a nuclear-armed Russia.
The Secretary of Defense is a key member of any Administration's national security team, an influential voice on wider issues of diplomatic and even economic strategy. This Administration's team has not yet jelled, and will not until the President himself begins to give personal direction.
Mr. Clinton's notion of simply leaving Bush Administration foreign policy on autopilot has not worked. Many Bush policies had already become outdated in the swiftly changed environment following the cold war. In other areas, what Mr. Bush left behind were not coherent policies, but time bombs waiting to explode after months of procrastination and evasion; for example, Bosnia and Haiti. Mr. Aspin took the heat for some of the consequences. So will his successor, unless American objectives are systematically rethought.
Whether the Clinton Administration can now begin to perform more smoothly on national security issues depends not only on the new Defense Secretary, but on the President's ability to absorb the lessons of a shaky first year.
Mr. Clinton deserves some credit for avoiding a major debacle in 1993, but he and Secretary-designate Inman have to reach for a higher mark in 1994.

HEADLINE: Restraining Property Seizures

 BODY:
Property seizures can be valuable supplements to law enforcement. By confiscating drug dealers' houses, cars, yachts and other property, Federal agents can disable their enterprises and deprive them of ill-gotten gains. But as the Supreme Court is beginning to suspect, such seizures can be abused to raise revenues.
Explaining the need for legal safeguards for seizures and forfeitures the other day, the high court cited a 1990 Justice Department memorandum to its far-flung agents. "We must significantly increase production to reach our budget target," the memo said. "Failure to achieve the $470 million projection would expose the Department's forfeiture program to criticism and undermine confidence in our budget projections." 
 When the Government has a strong economic motive to grab a person's house for budget-balancing purposes, the courts need to be vigilant to insure fairness, the Court said. A 5-to-4 majority ruled that property owners are entitled to advance notice and a hearing before Federal agents take their homes or land in connection with a drug case.
The decision was perhaps only a temporary victory for James Daniel Good, a small-time drug violator whose home in Hawaii was seized four years after he pleaded guilty to a marijuana charge and served a year in prison. After his hearing, Mr. Good and others whose homes are targeted may still lose their property, but not without a chance to contest the forfeiture.
In recent cases the increasingly cautious justices have blocked the seizure of a house from an owner if she can prove she was unaware that drug money was used to buy the home. They also served notice that some seizures can be so valuable compared with the crime as to violate the Eighth Amendment's ban on excessive fines.
The best way to achieve the law enforcement objectives of property seizures while curbing overzealous acquisitions is to reallocate where the money goes. Congress ought to require that forfeiture proceeds go to the general Treasury rather than to the law enforcement agencies that are making the seizures, thus removing any temptation to pad revenues with unwarranted property grabs.

HEADLINE: The Truth Rebuked on Haiti

 BODY:
John Shattuck is the State Department's highest human rights official. He is also an honest man. After a firsthand look at the deteriorating situation in Haiti, Mr. Shattuck concluded that the collapse of efforts to restore President Jean-Bertrand Aristide had intensified repression, and that a new wave of refugees would soon be on the way. He urged the Clinton Administration to review its policy of turning back every boat that attempts to flee Haiti. He wanted to assure that those with a legitimate claim to asylum get a fair chance to present their cases. What he got was an official rebuke.
So continues the cruel charade that has gone on since the Bush Administration started pretending that all those fleeing the terror unleashed by Haiti's September 1991 coup were economic refugees. That pretense was used to justify indiscriminate return, a policy that mocks American principles of asylum and one that is applied to Haitians alone. 
The real reason for this perverse policy is fear that the arrival of poor black Haitians, no matter how legitimate their claims, could provoke an ugly backlash. Rather than stand up for principle, two successive Presidents have bowed to political expediency. When he was a candidate, Bill Clinton denounced the Bush policy. But from the day he took office, he adopted that policy as his own. And while some of his senior people don't like the policy -- Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, reportedly called it a "dark stain" on the Administration's record -- it remains in place.
Neither Administration has chosen to intervene with force, and they were right to be cautious in this regard. But basic standards of fairness need to be followed. The U.S. has not hesitated to grant political asylum to all arriving Cubans, prompting speculation about politically driven distinctions. In particular, efforts to woo right-wing Floridians appear to dictate the admission of Cubans and the exclusion of Haitians, without fair regard to the justice of individual claims.
True, a just policy would cost money. While most departing Haitians do not qualify for political asylum, letting in those who do could burden some communities' economies. Washington would need to help offset these local costs.
Repression in Haiti is increasing. Military intervention has been ruled out. Diplomacy is stalled. The one remaining tool, U.N. economic sanctions, imposes heavy sacrifices on millions of poor people in order to squeeze a handful of insulated and recalcitrant coup leaders.
In this context, it is not too much to ask the Clinton Administration to absorb the modest costs of extending to Haitians the refugee standards available to everyone else.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Russia: Who's to Blame?

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
For days phone calls have been coming in from Russian friends, explaining to me and themselves how in their homeland a fascist nationalist could have become a strong contender for power.
In their explanations, and much of the American intellectual and political reaction, ran a theme of Western failure or guilt: 
 President Clinton was guilty for sticking so strongly to Boris Yeltsin. The NATO powers failed to soothe the fears of the Russian military. The West should have provided more money to stabilize the Russian economy.
Western guilt -- I think not. Russia did this to Russia.
Russians, not Westerners, checked the ballots; and a quarter of them, in a choice of national parties, selected the leadership of the man who promised another dictatorship and resurgent armed forces on the march. The memory of German voters helping Hitler leap to power is inevitable and valid.
Russian centuries did this -- centuries of czarist and Communist despots and church and state bigotry. Faced with the perils of freedom, a frightening number of voters turned to fascists, or Communists. They returned to the security of obedience, and the passions of Holy Russia that exclude all others as foreign to themselves and God.
This shocks the West. It should. We had forgotten how the realities of the old Russia could linger into the new. Remembering Russia's history does not diminish the importance of Russia's destruction of the Soviet prison empire, but makes it stand out greater, more thrilling.
Russians who oppose return to despotism will draw their own lessons. But it is important for foreigners not to make scapegoats of the Yeltsin people. They made mistakes, but their problems were not simply what they did but what they hoped for and could not achieve because of the heritage of Russian history.
The West must make its own military, economic and political decisions, to protect itself and help save the revolution from its enemies.
Militarily, talk of integrating Russia into NATO, or the halfway house of a military "Partnership for Peace," should be put aside. Neither can happen, or should, until any realistic threat of a new Russian despotism ends. To pretend otherwise now is a hoax.
Western nations should examine their own armed forces. Vladimir Zhirinovsky, and ilk, may not wait sweetly until the next election to take the presidency, but lunge for power anytime from tomorrow on. Not to examine Western readiness would be unthinkable negligence.
Economics: The free market is a road and a goal, not a religion. Russians, so many of them, are frightened by the price -- particularly unemployment. And why not? The West itself is not yet a fully free market. And we not only set our own pace but make sure the risks are protected by unemployment insurance and Social Security. We expect the Russians to leap from the trapeze with no net at all -- and like it.
If a slower pace is what Russians want, they are entitled to choose it -- without the blackmail of the threat of withdrawal of Western aid.
Politically Mr. Clinton is right not to give any sign of sidling away from Mr. Yeltsin. America has enough trouble already convincing foreign friends that it will be around tomorrow to finish what it starts today.
The President also should continue to make clear that the chasm between America and this Zhirinovsky is unbridgeable. A demagogue in command of Russian armed forces is a direct threat to the United States and its allies.
Already we read stories about how he will be more cooperative en route to the presidency, and that maybe he had a Jewish father. That would make him even more dangerous. Jews spreading anti-Semitism are straight-out lunatics, so deep in self-hatred that they cannot surrender hatred of anybody else.
On an October Sunday in 1965, The New York Times printed a story that a top leader of the American Nazi Party was a Jew. That day he shot himself. Mr. Zhirinovsky may not oblige, but in a cold winter it is a warming thought.
Mr. Clinton's duty is not simply to support a Yeltsin or oppose a Zhirinovsky but to remain true to the democratic ideals that helped bring about the anti-Communist revolution and still inspire so many Russians. That fidelity remains Russia's greatest asset, and America's.

HEADLINE: Getting a Diversified Start in the Market

BYLINE: By DEBORAH M. RANKIN

 BODY:
You're sitting with a little pot of money -- perhaps a year-end bonus, or an inheritance from your Aunt Edith. And you've decided that it's finally time to venture beyond mutual funds into some individual stocks.
"What most novice investors do, as a practical matter, is to become enamored of some stock they've just read about," said Michael Stolper, president of Stolper & Company, a San Diego firm that evaluates investment managers for wealthy individuals. "If they enjoy the experience -- that is, if they make some money -- they'll keep at it. The problem is that they usually wind up with a collection of consumer stocks without any diversification at all." 
 Investment professionals agree that the best way to enter the stock market is to spread your holdings among different areas.
"Most studies show that you need 8 to 12 stocks, in unrelated industries, to achieve adequate diversification," said John Markese, president of the American Association of Individual Investors, a Chicago educational organization. "At the very least, you need five stocks."
How much money do you need? Estimates range from just $5,000 to $50,000. Another factor, as important as sufficient funds, is whether you have the time and temperament to monitor a stock portfolio.
If you lack the money or the will, you may be far better off with an equity mutual fund, which has lower minimum investment requirements and provides professional portfolio management.
Assuming you have both, create a list of attractive but unrelated industries. Mr. Markese suggests checking whether the companies in the various industries share a product market (like fast-food outlets or prescription drugs), resources (like oil or lumber) and labor unions (like mine workers or airline pilots). Eliminate industries that overlap and winnow the list to five or six industries.
Mr. Markese then recommends buying in a round lot, say 100 shares, what you consider to be the best company in each industry. Continue this practice every quarter over a period of two to two and a half years, he advises.
This approach, however, does not provide instant diversification. For that reason, Peggy Schmeltz, a Bowling Green, Ohio, homemaker and individual investor, suggests an alternative. Mrs. Schmeltz, who has parlayed $75,000 that she inherited 15 years ago into a portfolio worth 20 times that amount, recommends buying the top stocks in three industries for starters.
"One may do well, one may go sideways, and one may go down," she said. Although the commissions on three transactions will be higher than on a single one, she said, "the chances are that you'll do better over all than if you sunk all your money into just one stock and it later drops by several points."
For the final selections, Mrs. Schmeltz looks for stocks that she thinks will double in value over five years. She focuses on a company's growth in sales and earnings, and favors stocks that have had steady year-to-year increases. She also looks for stocks that are attractively priced, with price-earnings ratios close to their growth rates and to their average ratio for the previous five years.
Linda D. Marcelli, a senior vice president with Merrill Lynch and manager of its largest branch office, at the World Financial Center in New York, suggests spreading purchases among large-company stocks, small-company stocks, growth stocks, value stocks, domestic stocks and international stocks.
"You want your portfolio to represent a number of different investment styles," she said. "The idea is to be positioned so you can participate in any market upturn."
She advises investing a third to half of your money immediately, and dollar-cost averaging the remaining balance for a year. Using the averaging technique, investors put a fixed amount each month in stocks, which allows them to buy more when share prices are low and less when prices are high.
Below are some other tips for novice investors.
*Expect to strike out a few times. Mrs. Schmeltz admits that even she stumbled: "A broker friend of mine recommended General Motors as my first purchase, and I bought it even though I didn't realize at the time that the auto industry is a cyclical one that goes up and down with changes in the economy. I bought it at $50, watched it go up to about $70, and then rode it down into the $60's, the $50's and the $40's. I now own more than 100 stocks, but that was my first and last cyclical."
*Use dividend reinvestment plans when possible. These plans, available widely with at least 120 stocks, allow you to reinvest dividends directly in additional shares of stock. This way, you buy automatically regardless of market conditions and pay little or no commissions.
*Expect to spend a fair amount of time monitoring your investments. Mrs. Schmeltz, for example, tries to devote 12 to 15 hours a week to her holdings, though this time is dwindling because of her new duties as chairwoman of the National Association of Investment Clubs. She also maintains a card file on some 200 prospective stocks, keeping track of company data like quarterly earnings, price-earnings ratios and returns on investment and equity.
If after you buy a stock, it declines and you still consider it a good buy, Mrs. Schmeltz recommends adding to your position. Then once you have about $10,000 more to invest, she advocates choosing three different industries and repeating the selection process.
If drugs, food and regional banks were represented in the first round, she said, you might look into restaurants, leisure time and health maintenance organizations for your next purchases.
Other sources of information are the American Association of Individual Investors in Chicago, (312) 280-1625, and the National Association of Investment Clubs in Royal Oak, Mich. (313) 543-0612.
The stocks that appear most frequently in the portfolios of investment clubs are McDonald's, Wal-Mart and Pepsico, according to the national association.
A major issue is whether to place your first stock purchase through a full-service broker, like Merrill Lynch or Smith Barney Shearson, which provides investment advice as well as order execution, or through a discount broker like Fidelity or Charles Schwab, which only executes trades.
There's no doubt you will save commission dollars -- up to half -- by using a discounter. But if you are uneasy about making investment decisions, you may feel more comfortable using a full-service broker, who can provide research reports on companies and advice on how to fashion a stock portfolio that is appropriate for your situation.
In any case, do not let concern over minimizing commission costs be the tail that wags the dog. Mrs. Marcelli cites "the 99:1 rule," which holds that 90 percent of the return of a portfolio is determined by the way money is allocated among different asset classes, 9 percent of the return is determined by the performance of the individual stocks or bonds selected and 1 percent of the return is determined by the execution of the order.
Although this rule works to the advantage of a full-service broker like Merrill Lynch, by minimizing the importance of its higher transaction costs, Mrs. Marcelli rightly notes that most people would benefit by devoting the bulk of their energy to deciding on asset classes and industry groups. "But most people concentrate on the 9 percent and the 1 percent, and spend very little time on the 90 percent," she said.
Whichever approach you follow, don't procrastinate. As Mr. Markese said: "Most people never start. First, they worry that the market is too high and wait for it to correct. But when the market comes down, it looks too gruesome, so then they wait for it to recover."

HEADLINE: New-Home Starts Are Up 3.9% As Buyers' Demand Turns Brisk

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
Spurred by eager buyers, the nation's builders broke ground on new homes at an annual rate of 1,432,000 last month, a pace 3.9 percent faster than in October and the highest rate since early 1990.
The increase in housing starts, the fourth straight, consisted entirely of single-family homes, reflecting what analysts say has become a sizable migration of apartment dwellers from rental units to their first houses. 
 The biggest spur to housing construction, which began to accelerate in August, has been the lowest interest rates in 20 to 25 years. The low rates, combined with generally stable or declining prices, have made homes more affordable than at any time many renters under 45 can recall.
 
'Excellent' Buying Conditions
 "Affordability conditions are excellent, with mortgage interest rates still at around 7 percent," J. Roger Glunt, president of the National Association of Home Builders, said earlier this month after the Government reported new-home sales for October. "Those low rates are prompting many people to buy their first homes."
Even the relatively dormant Northeast participated in the November advance. Construction began in the region on 142,000 new homes, at a seasonally adjusted rate, the second-highest pace of the year. Housing starts also jumped in the South but fell slightly in the Midwest and West.
"The housing sector continues to strengthen," economists at Merrill Lynch told clients in reaction to the Commerce Department's report. "There were only two months in the past 15 years where a higher level of single-family starts was recorded."
Permits for future construction bounded ahead 4.8 percent in November, a sign that the housing market -- and related sales of appliances, carpeting and other furnishings -- will remain vigorous in the new year. Housing gains have a strong "multiplier" effect on the economy, rippling through many trades and industries for months.
The revival in home building, along with a comeback for the automotive industry, has been a principal engine of economic acceleration this autumn, contributing heavily to what is expected to be a rate of growth in gross domestic product of more than 4 percent for the October-December quarter. The economy would be even stronger were it not for the shrinking military sector and a wave of corporate revamping that continues to stunt job growth.
Laurence H. Meyer & Associates, a St. Louis economic consulting company, said today that it was raising its forecast for housing starts and residential construction for the quarter by about $2 billion, pushing its estimate for gross domestic product up by nearly two-tenths of a point.
An uptick in mortgage rates since mid-October seems to have led some fence-sitting buyers to conclude that nothing further was to be gained from holding off and that the time to act had arrived.
Such reversals "always move buyers," said Robert J. Strudler, chairman of the U.S. Home Corporation, the country's fourth-largest builder. He noted that decisions these days are quickly translated into new business since those willing to hold, or finance, large inventories of homes are becoming scarce.
"Most of us are building to order," Mr. Strudler said, adding that few builders were putting up houses speculatively, hoping to find buyers after they were built.
Although new homes tend to be more expensive than resales, many new homes today are being tailored to first-time buyers' pocketbooks.
Interest rates bottomed at 6.74 percent for 30-year mortgages in the week that ended on Oct. 22, according to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, and have climbed to 7.17 this week. The current level, however, is still nearly a full percentage point below what it was, 8.14 percent, at the start of 1993.
Unlike many analysts, who expect interest rates to creep up, the chief economist of the National Association of Home Builders, David F. Seiders, predicts that long-term rates will edge back down. But he has not raised his estimate that 1,385,000 homes will be built next year, a pace below November's.
Last month's rise in starts of single-family homes was 4.5 percent, to a rate of 1,269,000, the Government reported, with a small gain in structures of two to four units offset by a small decline for larger buildings.
Multifamily construction remains depressed even though reinstatement in August of the tax credit for low-income housing halted a long decline and apparently brought stability to this segment of the market.
Starts in the Northeast jumped 17.4 percent, to a 142,000 annual rate, while those in the much busier South rose 8.4 percent, to a rate of 635,000. The declines in the Midwest, to 341,000, and in the West, to 314,000, were less than 3 percent.
The department slightly reduced its tally of nationwide starts for October but raised its September total by about the same amount, the report also showed. For the first 11 months of the year, starts ran 6 percent ahead of the period in 1992.
The actual number of dwellings started last month, without seasonal adjustment, was 102,900, down from 122,100 in October, as colder weather affected work in much of the country.
Permits for construction, seasonally adjusted, rose in all regions and included a moderate rebound for units in large buildings. The rise was 2.1 percent in the Northeast, 4 percent in the South, 4.2 percent in the West and 8.2 percent in the Midwest.

HEADLINE: Former Head of Power Authority Is Chosen to Be a Deputy Mayor

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday named John S. Dyson, a former chairman of the State Power Authority, as his Deputy Mayor for finance and economic development, filling out the top tier of his administration.
Mr. Dyson, who has also served as State Agriculture and Commerce Commissioner and pioneered the "I Love New York" promotional campaign, became the last of four deputy mayors to be appointed to City Hall, and the only one who has had significant government experience. While their party affiliations vary, all the deputies were crucial campaign supporters of Mr. Giuliani in either his first or second race for mayor. 
 Mr. Dyson, 50, a wealthy Dutchess County businessman and investor, said his talks with Mr. Giuliani about the deputy mayor's post began unexpectedly about two days ago after he sent the Mayor-elect a paper outlining 12 ideas for the city's economic development.
 
Unable to Persuade Parsons
 Until recently, Mr. Giuliani had been trying to persuade Richard D. Parsons, the chairman of the Dime Savings Bank and Mr. Giuliani's most prominent black supporter, to become a deputy mayor, aides said.
Introducing Mr. Dyson at a news conference, Mr. Giuliani, who had promised after a racially polarized vote to assemble a government representative of the city's diversity, showed impatience when questioned about the lack of a black official among his appointments so far.
"Give us a chance to put the government together before you criticize," Mr. Giuliani said, noting that he had not completed his top 30 to 40 appointments. "Why don't you give us a chance?"
Besides the deputy mayors, he has named a police commissioner, budget director, corporation counsel, press secretary, deputy press secretary and speech writer.
In keeping with his pledges to streamline government, Mr. Giuliani has eliminated two of the deputy posts that had existed under Mayor David N. Dinkins -- the first deputy mayor and the deputy mayor for public safety. He has said that the police commissioner, budget director and commissioner of investigation will all report to him directly.
Mr. Giuliani, seeking to blunt questions about relative lack of government experience among his Deputy Mayors, said, "There is going to be no inner cabinet," and added, "I very much think this city gets managed through commissioners."
"A government that was elected in order to make changes should be a government that has a substantial number of people who haven't been in government before," he said, "as well as some people who have been in government before so you have people you can rely on who have an understanding of what happens to that government."
In his 10 years in various state positions under two Democratic Governors, Hugh L . Carey and Mario M. Cuomo, Mr. Dyson was known for his flamboyance, his advertising campaigns to sell the state and its products, and his quick, though acerbic, wit. When Republicans in the State Legislature were threatening to bar his face from being used in advertisements by the Commerce Department, Mr. Dyson showed up at a legislative hearing in a Lone Ranger mask.
 
'Open for Business'
 He served as Commerce Commissioner for Mr. Carey during a period in which the Democratic administration reduced the top personal income tax rate and took credit for stemming a loss of jobs from the state. He stepped down from government in 1985, when he resigned as chairman of the State Power Authority. Yesterday Mr. Dyson vowed to "unfurl a new banner over our skyline that says, 'New York is open for business.' "
Echoing Mr. Giuliani's own priorities, he said the city government had to improve its business climate by signaling that "we are beginning to cut taxes." Mr. Dyson said his mission was also to mount an assault on red tape and "rigid bureaucratic procedures," to bring an entrepreneurial spirit to government and to let businesses know "that we will cherish them, not punish them."
He also said the city should clean up its airports and the highways leading from them, to prevent arriving executives from getting a bad impression. "Safe streets are a business issue," he said.
As Deputy Mayor for economic development, Mr. Dyson will not only oversee such departments as Finance, Business Services, Employment, Telecommunications and Energy, but also Cultural Affairs, which Mr. Giuliani called crucial to the economy of the city.
While Mr. Dyson is a Democrat, he was a prominent supporter of Mr. Giuliani in 1989, campaigning at his side and becoming a major fund-raiser for the Republican-Liberal, responsible for $50,000 in contributions and a $100,000 loan. He said he provided occasional advice again in this campaign.
But he was solicited to join the Giuliani administration only over the last few days, promoted by a combination of Mr. Carey; the Liberal Party leader, Raymond B. Harding, and Mr. Giuliani's campaign media strategist, David Garth, said an adviser to Mr. Giuliani, who spoke only on the condition of anonymity.
"This was not 100 percent expected, you might understand," Mr. Dyson said yesterday.
Mr. Dyson has been running the Millbrook Vineyards winery and an investment company, Dyson Sinclair. His new job requires that he live in the city, and he said he would move to a "pied-a-terre" he keeps on Fifth Avenue. He said he would close his investment firm and put his holdings in a blind trust.
Mr. Dyson, who lost a 1986 Democratic Senate primary to Mark Green after spending $6 million of his own money, had been mentioned as a possible candidate for state comptroller next year. But he said yesterday, "I think I'll be too busy for the next two years to run for any office."

HEADLINE: After Years of Ignoring AIDS Epidemic, Kenya Has Begun Facing Up to It

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Dec. 17

 BODY:
John Wainaina had heard about AIDS for years but never thought it was an illness that could touch him or his friends. Life was good. The 40-year-old construction worker was healthy and had a job, a family and, like many of his contemporaries, several girlfriends.
Today, 16 months after testing positive for H.I.V., Mr. Wainaina, emaciated and weak, shares a bed with another patient in Kenyatta Hospital here, too ashamed and too frightened to tell his friends and relatives that he has AIDS. At first, he did not even tell his doctor. 
 Mr. Wainaina is a victim of a growing epidemic that the Government and health officials say threatens to destroy the economic backbone of East Africa's wealthiest country in the next decade.
 
Government Starting to Act
 After years of passivity, the Government is finally facing up to the threat and taking a forceful role in the fight against AIDS.
Mr. Wainaina's four children in a nearby suburb are healthy, but his wife has tested positive for H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, though she has no symptoms of the disease.
Three of his friends have died of AIDS, and Mr. Wainaina guesses that at least five other friends who saw the same women must also be H.I.V. positive.
"Of course I was aware" that AIDS existed, he said. "But back then I was a young man, with a job, a car. None of us used condoms. People thought that if you get AIDS, you die right away. So if you stay healthy, you're O.K.
"I am so ashamed. I cannot even tell my brothers. If I tell my friends, they will sneak away and they won't help. And then what will happen to my children when we are gone?"
This year the AIDS epidemic was debated in Kenya's Parliament and Cabinet for the first time. Leading Government officials, including President Daniel arap Moi and Vice President George Saitoti regularly warn the public in speeches to avoid infection. National officials are instructing district administrators, including local tribal chiefs, to tell people that they must take responsibility for their future by practicing safe sex and limiting their sexual partners.
"We have not come out as fast as we should have in talking about AIDS," said Naftali Agata, director of the Health Ministry's program for AIDS prevention. "The Government has now made a definite commitment."
The Government estimates that 800,000 people in this country of 22 million are infected with H.I.V., including 30,000 children. The exact number of AIDS cases in Kenya is not known, but a recent survey by the Agency for International Development put the number at about 100,000.
Roughly 900,000 Kenyans are expected to die of AIDS by the year 2000, and another 2 million will be infected by the turn of the century, Government officials say.
Already struggling with inadequate financing and a surge in tropical diseases like malaria, Kenya's public health system will be unable to cope, and the loss of millions of young and skilled workers will devastate the country's already faltering economy, experts say.
Though the virus has been racing through sub-Saharan Africa since the early 1980's, Kenya has been far slower than many of its neighbors to acknowledge the epidemic or combat it through education and prevention programs.
Its record presents a paradox. Despite an economic decline linked to corruption and the collapse of global commodity prices, Kenya is still the wealthiest country in East Africa and has been relatively stable since it won independence from Britain the 1960's. If any country in the region could have coped with AIDS, experts reasoned, it would have been Kenya.
 
Threat to Tourism Feared
 But unlike neighbors like Uganda, where the Government of President Yoweri Museveni opened an aggressive campaign to halt the spread of AIDS in the mid-1980's, the Kenyan Government tended to play down the threat for fear that it would keep tourists and much-needed cash away from its game parks and beach resorts.
Though Kenyan doctors diagnosed their first AIDS case in 1984, the Government did not release national statistics on the malady until 1986. That year it listed one AIDS-related death.
After years of semiofficial neglect, the Government must now do far more than simply acknowledge the epidemic, Kenyan officials now say.
"We have to develop strategies that are broader than just writing something in the media," said Mr. Agata, the head of the Government's AIDS prevention program. "Unless awareness of AIDS is going to change behavior, we are not going to achieve anything."
Among the biggest challenges the Government faces are a general reluctance among Kenyans to talk about sexuality, the illusion that AIDS can be contained within certain population groups and the shame people feel when they discover that they have the disease.
Attitudes of patients here contrast with those in Uganda, which has the highest number of recorded cases of H.I.V. infection in Africa -- around 1.5 million. There, AIDS has touched virtually every family and much of the cultural, religious and psychological stigma of the disease has slipped away. Uganda and several other African countries have developed grass-roots strategies to cope with the epidemic, including home care networks and community support and counseling groups.
In Kenya, with an abundance of victims like Mr. Wainaina, who heard about AIDS years ago but never thought he could contract it, the Government will have to find ways to "personalize" the disease.
Here, as in other African countries, the virus is transmitted mainly through heterosexual contact among young adults. It has spread through East Africa in the wake of wars and political upheaval, and more recently along the long-haul truck routes linking Tanzanian and Kenyan ports to the landlocked interior of Ethiopia, Uganda, Rwanda, Burundi and the eastern part of Zaire.
More than two-thirds of all estimated AIDS cases worldwide are in sub-Saharan Africa, according to the most recent survey by the World Health Organization. The cumulative total of H.I.V. infection on the continent is close to 10 million, with 1.5 million new infections this year, according to M. H. Merson, executive director of the World Health Organization's global program on AIDS. Experts projected this week that 20 million Africans will have been infected by the end of the century.
 
Estimates of Infection
 Estimates of H.I.V. infection are based on scientifically compiled samples and are considered far more reliable than country-by-country tallies of AIDS cases, which are provided by the African governments.
In Kenya, experts report, H.I.V. is generally more prevalent among people with higher-paid jobs, like businessmen in Nairobi and Mombasa and truck drivers who ply the roads from the eastern coast to the interior.
Kenya's bigger cities have became magnets for men in search of work. Separated from their families for months, many eventually contract H.I.V. and bring it back to their villages. A great number of women in the cities who have been abandoned by men or in need of extra income turn to prostitution.
Dr. Frank Plummer, an associate professor at the Universities of Manitoba and Nairobi who is an expert on infectious disease, estimated that 12 percent of young adults in the city were now H.I.V. positive.
The Kenyan Health Ministry estimates that by the year 2000 the cost of AIDS will be the equivalent of 15 percent of the country's gross domestic product. At the same time that it is coming to terms with the AIDS threat, the Kenyan Government is struggling to come up with money to combat other diseases. Malaria is still the biggest killer, with more than 10,000 deaths attributed to it last year, Mr. Agata said.
 
Spending on Prevention
 In 1993, 20 percent of the Kenyan Health Ministry's budget of about $60 million went to AIDS prevention, a figure that Mr. Agata described as "totally inadequate."
The Government has made an extra allocation of $77,000 for AIDS programs for 1994. But most of the money for AIDS prevention comes from foreign donors like the United States Agency for International Development. It provided about $2 million this year for prevention programs and expects to supply $4 million in 1994, including $2 million worth of free condoms.
Given the limits on their resources, Kenyan Government officials say they need to focus on changing sexual behavior, mainly by counseling abstention, monogamy and the use of condoms.
The Agency for International Development calculated in one survey that only 12 percent of Kenyan men currently use condoms. But the chief of the agency's population and health sector, Gary Newton, said the figure had probably been close to zero only three years ago.
In the long term, international experts say, Kenya must also establish a far-flung program of home care for AIDS sufferers. A survey by the Agency for International Development says that AIDS patients currently occupy 15 percent of the country's hospital beds.
At Kenyatta Hospital, which with 2,000 beds is one of the largest hospitals in sub-Saharan Africa, the wards are so crowded that patients share beds and lie curled on blankets on the floor.
On an average day, the hospital is short of cancer drugs, penicillin, plastic gloves, disposable needles and linen. One official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the hospital had received no screening kits in the last six months to test for the presence of H.I.V. in donated blood.
"The health infrastructure will never be able to bear the burden of AIDS when it is full-blown," warned the hospital's director, Dr. Julius Meme. "We even have a shortage of blood. People used to donate quite freely. Not any more. They're scared.
"We can't keep burying our head in the sand and say it doesn't exist," he added.

HEADLINE: NEW YELTSIN MOVES MAY SIGNAL EASING IN ECONOMY REFORM

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 17

 BODY:
In what may be a sign of a weakening of economic resolve after his electoral rebuff on Sunday, President Boris N. Yeltsin today granted new heavily subsidized loans that could aggravate the budget deficit and inflation.
At the same time, after an extended debate, Mr. Yeltsin's Government approved the draft of a weaker, less centralized privatization program over objections from well-known reformers, including First Deputy Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar and Privatization Minister Anatoly B. Chubais. 
 The economic actions may or may not be straws in the wind, and Mr. Yeltsin's ultimate course may not be known until next week. At that time, his aides say, Mr. Yeltsin plans to comment for the first time on the election, in which there was a surge of support for critics of reform and for the caustic nationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky.
 
Gore Critical of I.M.F.
 But the steps taken today, including the $120 million in subsidized loans for agriculture enterprises, came at a time when the International Monetary Fund has been criticized by Vice President Al Gore as being insensitive to the plight of those in Russia who have lost their jobs because of sharp cuts in Russian military spending.
On Thursday in Moscow, Mr. Gore accused the monetary fund of being too strict in its conditions for loans to Russia, even though the fund has loosened its normal requirements to provide Russia $2.5 billion on the basis of Government promises of financial restraint that have not been met.
"Every country with representatives on the I.M.F. board has been slow to recognize the hardship caused by some of what has been done in the past," Mr. Gore said. "That may cause a diplomatic incident, but I don't care."
 
$1.5 Billion Is Delayed
 The fund has delayed a second installment of $1.5 billion in special financing because of poor Russian financial management, arguing that such loans are useless unless tied to a serious program to stabilize the economy and reduce inflation of 15 to 20 percent a month.
Mr. Gore's statement, which diplomats said they assumed had been coordinated with the White House, seemed to reflect a possible shift of support toward more direct Western subsidy of Russia's work force during the painful transition to a market economy.
Many Russians have criticized the West for providing lots of advice, but little money to back it up. But many Western countries fear that easing credit terms would destroy the credibility of the fund around the world. Some suggest that perhaps a new agency should be given the task of subsidizing the economic transformation of Russia, if that is what Washington intends.
Mr. Yeltsin handed out the loans today while the reformist Finance Minister, Boris G. Fyodorov, was meeting officials of the Group of Seven nations in Paris to discuss Western aid and debt relief for Russia. The loans were for farm machinery enterprises at 25 percent interest a year, far below the Central Bank's discount rate of 210 percent, the Interfax news agency said.
Mr. Fyodorov and Western economic advisers to the Government had said before the elections that the days of such artificially cheap loans, at interest rates well below the rate of inflation, were over.
[A senior United States Treasury official said in Washington that Mr. Fyodorov had told the Group of Seven in Paris that there would be a continuation of economic reforms in Russia, and that the approval of the new Russian Constitution on Sunday would help carry them out.]
The handout will add to a Government deficit that is bound to swell in the new year, as about $4 billion in deferred Government payments to farmers, miners and the military are finally paid. The major Western industrialized countries are looking for Russia to get its budget deficit down and monthly inflation to less than 10 percent this year.
 
No Mandate for Reformers
 But the West's expectations that Russia's reformers would have the mandate to push through a tough economic stabilization program after the elections have been dashed.
Mr. Yeltsin, aides said, may deliver a long statement on the election at a news conference next week. His silence has baffled many supporters, leading to suggestions that he is seeking ways to work with Mr. Zhirinovsky, who won the largest share of party preference votes on Sunday and will command the second-largest bloc in the lower house of Parliament.
The aides also said there was likely to be a Government reshuffle, though Mr. Yeltsin will reaffirm support for Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, who did not run in the election, and "the core" of pro-reform ministers.
But it seems likely that Mr. Yeltsin and Mr. Chernomyrdin will shy away from calls to throw their support fully behind the reformers, instead trying to pull in some officials from centrist parties who have opposed the current pace of economic change.
The privatization measures for 1994 were approved at a long and contentious Government meeting run by Mr. Chernomyrdin's favorite deputy, Oleg N. Soskovets.
Well-known reformers like the Privatization Minister, Mr. Chubais, complained that the draft gave far more rights and discretion to the regions than the previous program and imposes more curbs on the privatization of property, Interfax said.
Mr. Gaidar, the First Deputy Prime Minister, complained that it would be "irresponsible to tamper with the privatization program" until July 1, when the period for using privatization vouchers, issued to every Russian citizen, expires.
While all these economic steps were being debated and carried out, the vote on Sunday remained a focus of uncertainty today. At a news conference, the head of the Central Election Committee, Nikolai Ryabov, said that even the preliminary vote count was not yet completed, raising concerns about possible manipulation of the results.
According to almost complete preliminary counts, he said, Mr. Yeltsin's strong-presidency Constitution was approved in a general turnout of 54.8 percent of the 106.1 million registered voters. A minimum 50 percent turnout was required to make the constitutional referendum valid.
Mr. Ryabov also said 32.9 million people, or 58.4 percent of those voting, had voted for the constitution. If he is right, that would mean a turnout for the constitution ballot alone of only 53.1 percent.
 
Discrepancy Not Explained
 But Itar-Tass, citing "reliable sources," said tonight that only 50.14 percent of registered Russian voters had turned out, extremely close to the minimum required. There was no immediate explanation for the discrepancy.
In 8 of the 20 ethnic republics, Mr. Ryabov said, less than 50 percent of voters turned out, casting a shadow on the results. Those 8 were Tatarstan (where less than 25 percent voted), Bashkortostan, Dagestan, Tuva, Chuvashia, Mordovia, Adyegya and Karachayevo-Cherkasia. Chechnya, which has declared independence, did not vote.
Mr. Ryabov did not detail the party affiliations of those elected to the lower house. Half the 450 seats are filled through proportional representation, from party lists, and the other half are filled by direct constituency election, as is the entire upper house.
No single bloc or faction will have a working majority in the lower house, which will be controlled by the 130 or so elected as independents.
The upper house will have few, if any, Zhirinovsky supporters, but it will include many Yeltsin foes.

HEADLINE: U.S. Disenchantment With Aristide Growing

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
In the latest public suggestion that they are growing disenchanted with Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Clinton Administration officials today expressed tepid support for the exiled Haitian leader and grumbled privately about their frustrations with him.
For now at least, they say, they will continue efforts to restore him to power. But they are wringing their hands over what they call his inflexibility. 
 "I don't pretend at all that the path will be easy," Secretary of State Warren Christopher said at the State Department today. "But the United States is resolute about pursuing the restoration of democracy and the return of President Aristide."
But Mr. Christopher was less than enthusiastic about the Haitian leader, saying only that he had been "responsive and effective" in meetings.
 
Sign of Displeasure
 Senior State Department officials said later that Mr. Christopher intended to signal the Administration's displeasure with Father Aristide. "I would not describe the Secretary's comments as effusive with respect to Aristide," a senior State Department official said.
Administration officials are furious with Father Aristide for scuttling an initiative by Robert Malval, his hand-picked Prime Minister, that was intended to ease the Catholic priest's return from exile in Washington. The initiative involved the convening of a conference held by a cross section of segments of Haitian society, including the military.
Military leaders like Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras have refused to abide by the so-called Governors Island Accords, reached last summer in New York, which were supposed to lead to the exiled President's return on Oct. 30.
Father Aristide originally backed the new initiative by Mr. Malval but last week withdrew his support, saying the safety of his supporters who might attend such a conference could not be guaranteed.
 
Reservations Expressed
 "A lot of people expressed reservations to Malval about the possibility of holding such a meeting under the current circumstances," said Michael K. Barnes, Father Aristide's legal adviser here. "The security situation in the country, in the view of most knowledgeable observers, makes it impossible to hold a meeting where people feel they could participate without being killed."
On Wednesday, Mr. Malval's resignation became effective. Though he will stay on until a successor is named, Father Aristide has instructed him not to undertake any new initiatives.
At a news conference on Wednesday, Mr. Malval broke into tears after telling reporters that Haiti, whose economy has been battered by a United Nations oil embargo, was "in a desperate situation."
Aides to Father Aristide acknowledge that they sense a rising level of irritation on the part of Administration officials. But one adviser said he believed it reflected the anger of Administration officials with their own inability to carry through with their promise to return Father Aristide to power.
Administration officials freely acknowledge they are at a loss on what they should do next if Haiti's military leaders continue to defy the entreaties of the international community for Aristide to return. Military intervention has been ruled out, and there is increasing concern over the hardship the oil embargo is causing to the average Haitian.
And there are signs of divisions within the Administration over some of the most fundamental questions of Haitian policy, such as whether the United States would participate in a military mission to monitor and retrain the Haitian military if they agree to let Father Aristide return.

HEADLINE: Pentagon's Budget Gap Is Narrowed to $31 Billion

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
Anxious to put to rest a public dispute between the Pentagon and the White House before Bobby Ray Inman takes over as Defense Secretary, senior Administration officials today produced more optimistic inflation estimates showing that a $50 billion Pentagon shortfall had shrunk to $31 billion.
A top White House official also told reporters that President Clinton was determined to maintain the Pentagon strategy of preparing to fight two regional wars virtually at once and to buy the aircraft carriers and maintain the Army divisions and Air Force wings necessary to carry out the strategy. 
 "The President said he is committed to funding the strategy," Anthony Lake, the national security adviser, said today after he met with Mr. Clinton, Defense Secretary Les Aspin and Leon E. Panetta, the budget director. "That will be the assumption."
The comments by Mr. Lake and other top White House and Pentagon officials were intended to strengthen ties with the military and rebut Republican assertions that Mr. Aspin was leaving because of budget cuts that would undermine the armed forces.
 
Optimistic Assumptions
 The economic assumptions that reduced the shortfall for the Pentagon's five-year plan were developed by the Council of Economic Advisers, whose estimate is more optimistic than the one the Pentagon had been using to develop its budget for 1995-1999.
The gap stems from the decision to raise military pay and faulty inflation estimates developed earlier this year. With the Administration committed to reducing the deficit, funds that go to the Pentagon to help make up its shortfall will come at the expense of other agencies, including hard-pressed domestic spending programs.
Top Pentagon and White House officials, gathering in an unusual display of unity, summoned reporters for the latest White House inflation estimate.
But the officials refused to say how much of the $31 billion shortfall, which the Pentagon had estimated at $47.5 billion, would have to be absorbed in new Pentagon cuts, or if the Defense Department would have to reopen its comprehensive "bottom up review" of military spending. They said the budget issue still needed to be worked out.
The officials also declined to say whether the Pentagon would receive more funds if the White House's latest inflation estimate turned out to be low.
 
Sense of Harmony Seen
 Some budget experts on Capitol Hill said the White House assertion that inflation would be less than had been projected earlier was plausible, although they said they would reserve judgment until they examined details of the Administration's economic forecasts.
But some military officials said they were suspicious that the problem was being papered over to create a sense of harmony before Mr. Inman replaces Mr. Aspin as Secretary of Defense.
"We are not falling off our foreign policy commitments," one general said. "We are not falling off our level of projected forces. It does not add up."
Mr. Aspin discussed several options for cuts in military programs in a 90-minute meeting this morning with the President, and has also presented the options to the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
The issue has to be resolved soon so that the Pentagon and the other departments and agencies can complete their budget requests for next year. Mr. Clinton will make the final decisions on the Defense Department budget before Christmas.
 
Committed to Aspin Plan
 As the President considered the options, top Administration officials said the White House was still committed to maintaining a force of 12 aircraft carriers, 10 active Army divisions and 20 active and reserve Air Force tactical air wings. That was the force proposed by Mr. Aspin's review to maintain the ability to fight two wars "nearly simultaneously."
The officials also said that, to maintain the combat readiness of the armed forces, they intended to continue with military training and to buy the necessary spare parts. This means that any offsetting budget cuts must come from programs for new weapons and areas like environmental cleanup.
The Defense Department, in addition to the budget shortfall it is facing with its five-year plan, is trying to identify $13 billion in offsetting cuts to accommodate the forces it wants to keep.
The Pentagon is not the only department that faces a gap between what it wants for the 1995 fiscal year, which begins next Oct. 1, and what the White House is proposing to request from Congress. The Central Intelligence Agency wants White House support for its budget request.
 
State Department Shortfall
 And Secretary of State Warren Christopher met today with Mr. Clinton to ask for additional funds to cover the shortfall between the State Department's plans for foreign aid, dues to the United Nations, funds for international organizations to contain population growth and preserve the environment, and money to operate American embassies around the world.
One senior State Department official said the gap for next years' budget was about $3 billion, though Mike McCurry, a spokesman for the department, insisted that figure was not accurate.
Mr. McCurry said Secretary Christopher had been arguing "passionately" for White House support for the department's foreign affairs budget.
"He's been selling hard for some time," Mr. McCurry said. "He feels very strongly that diplomacy deserves to be funded at adequate levels and that you can't continue to sort of nickel and dime the diplomatic function within the Federal budget as this country has over the last decade."
Senior Administration officials said that the President had discussed military spending with Mr. Inman and indicated that whatever happened he would not seek less military spending for next year than had been previously planned. Mr. Panetta has publicly made such an assurance.

HEADLINE: U.S. Envoy Says Crackdown Strengthened Aidid's Faction

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's special envoy to Somalia said today that the failed effort to hunt down Gen. Mohammed Farah Aidid during the summer actually strengthened the Somali faction leader politically and militarily.
In a speech to a group of reporters in Washington, Robert B. Oakley, who represented President Clinton in Somalia, said that General Aidid remains a "threat" to United Nations efforts to rebuild Somalia. 
 "Up until the first of November the net result of what had begun on June 5 had strengthened him considerably," Mr. Oakley said. The earlier date was when 24 Pakistani peacekeepers were killed by fighters believed to be part of Gen. Aidid's forces.
After the June clash, the United Nations branded General Aidid a criminal, setting off a manhunt that resulted in numerous street battles between United Nations forces and Aidid militia members. Those clashes culminated on Oct. 3 with a battle that left 18 Americans dead and 75 wounded.
 
Caused an Uproar
 The raid caused an uproar in the United States and produced demands in Congress for an immediate withdrawal. Instead, President Clinton opted for a withdrawal by March 31.
Mr. Oakley's remarks came as the first American combat unit began leaving. Some 450 infantrymen from the 10th Mountain Division left for Fort Drum, N.Y.
Members of the battalion, two of whom died and 24 of whom were wounded in the fighting on Oct. 3, told Reuters that Somalia shattered their ideas of saving famine victims.
"I didn't see one starving person in my five months here," said Sgt. Steve Andrews, 28, who is from Baltimore. "And we certainly did a lot more chasing Aidid than we expected."
 
More of a Threat
 In his speech today, Mr. Oakley said that General Aidid "is perceived by the rest of the country as being more of a threat than he was before.
But Mr. Oakley said that General Aidid had not gained strength in the rest of the country and does not have the military might to bring the other Somali clans under his sway.
General Aidid's strength is one of factors the Administration is considering as it ponders changing the focus of its aid efforts in Somalia.
Efforts to broker a peace collapsed last week, leading some United Nations officials to fear that fighting would renew after the United States completes its withdrawal.
Earlier this week, Richard McCall, chief of staff for the Agency for International Development, told reporters that the United States and other countries were considering limiting efforts to rebuild Somalia to areas where there is no factional fighting, and trying to isolate areas controlled by factions that do not cooperate.
Mr. Oakley said today that a lull in fighting has continued.
"The crisis is simmering, rather than exploding like a volcano," he said.

HEADLINE: Holiday Shoppers Are Whipping Out the Plastic

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Retailers and credit card companies say shoppers are charging more purchases this holiday season, a sign of improving consumer confidence.
The volume of retail sales cleared through Mastercard's network jumped almost 20 percent between the day after Thanksgiving and last Friday. Over the last weekend, Visa processed about 850 transactions in its peak second, beating out 811 calls in last year's peak second, which fell on the Saturday before Christmas. 
 But merchants and credit industry analysts caution that the leap in purchases on credit, a trend that has been building since the beginning of the year, will not necessarily translate into equally robust sales increases. In part, consumers are responding to promotions and incentives like mileage points for dollars spent, using cards instead of cash.
"The growth you're seeing in the use of bank cards is apart from retail sales growth," said Kurt Peters, publisher of Credit Card News, which is published by Faulkner & Gray Inc.
 
Sales Up in Malls
 Sales in shopping malls through the first 17 days of the holiday season rose 5.7 percent, according to a survey by the International Council of Shopping Centers. In comparison, sales charged to Visa cards were up 28 percent from the day after Thanksgiving through last Saturday.
"It doesn't necessarily tell us how robust sales will be, but it does tell us the customer seems to be regaining some confidence," said Bernard Fuchs, chairman and chief executive of Specialty Retailers Inc., which operates Palais Royale and Bealls department stores in Texas.
While retailers welcome any sign of renewed shopping vigor, some consultants are concerned that the increased credit card volume may be a damper on sales in the new year. Last year, use of credit cards also heated up at Christmas time, with sales up an average of 8 percent. After the bills arrived in January, however, consumers clamped down on further purchasing until August.
"The increased use of credit cards means, in my opinion, that the consumer who is going to be hit with higher taxes anyway will cut back on spending," said Walter F. Loeb, a retail consultant.
Credit card companies say, however, that while use has skyrocketed, card holders are also paying off bigger portions of their balances. Mr. Fuchs of Specialty Retailers said that the main factor encouraging credit card use during the 1992 holiday season -- euphoria in the aftermath of the Presidential election -- was not driving usage this year. "I think people are feeling more secure about their prospects, and I think they're being smarter about how they use their cards," he said.
Use of cards like Visa and Mastercard, as well as Specialty Retailers' own proprietary credit cards has increased about 2 percent or 3 percent during the season, Mr. Fuchs said, and other retailers, particularly department stores, report even greater increases in card use. Don Shinkle, a spokesman for Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the country's largest retailer, said card use had increased about 35 percent this year. "That trend is holding the same over the holidays," he said.
Mr. Peters and others say special incentives that credit cards companies are offering, combined with lower interest rates, are paying off.
Mastercard and Visa have both beefed up their holiday promotions, and some department stores are using their credit cards to promote their Christmas business. Both Saks Fifth Avenue and Bloomingdale's held special shopping nights for their best credit card customers, and in February, Saks First card holders, the premier group, will receive a bonus certificate equal to 10 percent of their purchases in November and December, which can be redeemed for merchandise early next year.
 
Catalogue Sales Consistent
 While sales in stores have seesawed up and down during the holiday season, catalogue sales, which are largely through credit cards, have been fairly consistent. Major discounters have installed new technology that improves credit card processing, and Sears, Roebuck & Company, the country's third-largest retailer, just started accepting Visa and Mastercard this year.
"We've seen quite an increase in mail- and phone-order activity, as well as a somewhat smaller increase in transactions at discount stores," Albert Coscia, a Visa spokesman, said.
Mastercard has increased the number of merchants participating in its Master Values program, which gives holiday shoppers as much as a 25 percent discount on items purchased from participating retailers like Camelot Music stores, Mattel Toys and the Right Start catalogue. Visa changed its annual holiday promotion to increase the number of card users likely to benefit from it and gave merchants incentives to promote it, as well.
 
Co-Branded Cards Growing
 But the real engine powering the explosion of credit card purchases year-round, credit card experts and retailers say, is the growth of co-branded cards like the GM Card, a Mastercard that gives users a rebate toward the purchase of General Motors cars and trucks, and Citibank's program with American Airlines that gives shoppers frequent flier miles.
"The frequency of usage of our co-branded cards is always higher than our regular cards," said Stephen J. Bartell, vice president of co-branded and affinity marketing at Mastercard. "People will go in and start using them in lieu of cash because they want the rewards."
Mr. Shinkle of Wal-Mart said that in addition to such incentives, speedier processing had also fueled the use of credit cards. He said Wal-Mart installed technology a little more than a year ago that made the approval process almost instant. "Not too long ago, customers hesitated to use their cards because it took so doggone long to get a transaction processed," he said.

HEADLINE: Accord on Health Care Reached in Albany

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 17

 BODY:
After eight months of tortuous negotiation over health care financing, the State Legislature and Gov. Mario M. Cuomo struck an agreement tonight to grant hospitals a modest increase in revenues and provide new incentives for improving preventive and family care.
Because the bill would leave New York's health care system largely intact, critics said it would fall far short of the blueprint for change once envisioned by Mr. Cuomo. The Governor abandoned proposals to grant no rise in financing to hospitals, to cap doctors' fees and to tighten the state's control over the proliferation of expensive medical equipment. 
 With President Clinton and Congress considering a radical overhaul of the country's health care system, Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature left the most difficult decisions about New York's health system for another day. They did not consider creating a universal health care system or debate other sweeping changes in the insurance system.
"There's a lot of good in this package," said Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, a Manhattan Democrat who is chairman of the Health Committee. "But it's hard to do major system reform when the Federal Government is on the verge of changing all the rules of the game."
 
More Aid to Hospitals
 Leading legislators and Cuomo administration aides said the bill would increase revenues at the state's hospitals about 5.6 percent a year for the next two years. They said it would also funnel new money to struggling hospitals, to training for emergency medical technicians, to hospital tuberculosis units and to programs to care for infants with AIDS.
Assembly Democrats failed in the final talks to win agreement from Senate Republicans to expand eligibility for a popular program of state-subsidized health insurance for the children of the working poor.
The bill passed both the Senate and Assembly late tonight.
With the state's hospital reimbursement system scheduled to expire on Dec. 31, the bill's sponsors said they were relieved to have an agreement at last that would allow the state's hospitals to budget for the next year. Hospital executives had predicted fiscal chaos if the deadline lapsed without a bill.
 
Albany Controls Repayments
 Through an intricate formula, the state controls the rates that Medicaid and private insurers use to reimburse hospitals for various procedures. It can also use the formula to direct money to hospitals in particular regions or to those with fiscal problems caused by heavy caseloads of poor or chronically ill patients.
The formula expires every two or three years, and the ensuing battle to revise it is driven by the competing interests of doctors, hospitals, insurance companies and citizens' groups.
The Senate sponsor of the bill, Michael J. Tully of Roslyn Heights, L.I., said he hoped the agreement would not lead to increases in health insurance fees. But leaders of patients' groups predicted that it would.
"There is no cost containment but almost a billion more dollars spent on hospitals and only a fraction of that on primary care," said Richard Kirsch, director of Citizen Action, a patients' group. "The Governor and Legislature have utterly failed at health care reform."
 
Cuomo Agrees to a Change
 But Richard M. Cook, the Governor's deputy secretary for health, disagreed. "This bill is the most significant increase in primary care that the state has made in 10 years," he said. Mr. Cook added that the Cuomo administration would continue to push for controlling the growth in health care costs.
Mr. Cuomo originally proposed to limit health care costs by not increasing hospital reimbursement rates, which currently generate about $10 billion in revenues, according to the State Health Department. But with hospitals facing deep new cuts in Federal Medicare payments, he eventually agreed to a Senate plan that would funnel an additional $181 million a year to hospitals.
That increase is about 1.8 percent on top of a 3.8 percent increase that is already built into the hospital financing formula to keep pace with inflation, said Peter Slocum, a Health Department spokesman.
Daniel Sisto, president of the Hospital Association of New York State, said the higher payments to hospitals would barely offset the losses inflicted this year by Congress through cuts in Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly.
 
Help for Poorly Served Areas
 "Next year we're looking at a $170 million loss from Medicare," Mr. Sisto said. "This should help stabilize hospitals in 1994 and give them time to prepare for the initiatives in Clinton's health security act."
The bill would add $13 million a year to an existing $22 million for grants to doctors, hospitals and clinics that set up preventive and family care practices in underserved areas. It would also spend about $15 million to forgive medical school loans for family doctors, give grants to medical schools that stress family and preventive medicine, increase aid to schools that recruit minority doctors, and give scholarships to aspiring midwives, nurse practitioners and physician's assistants.
The Democrats who control the Assembly fought to expand the eligibility for the state's Child Health Plus program. Created in 1990, the program provides health coverage for children under 13 from families that cannot afford insurance but are not poor enough to qualify for Medicaid.
The Assembly majority proposed expanding the program to cover 13-year-olds next year and 14-year-olds in 1995, at a cost of $5 million the first year and $12 million the second.
 
Opposed by Catholic Group
 The state Catholic Conference opposed the expansion on the ground that it might make state-financed abortions available to young teen-agers. Senate leaders said they were not persuaded by that argument but were opposing the proposal because it was not affordable.
Instead, all sides agreed to increase money for the program so that the state can afford to cover more of the children who are now eligible. There are now 64,000 children enrolled out of an estimated 170,000 who are eligible. With the new money, about 80,000 children should be covered by the program next year, legislative aides said.

HEADLINE: Interest Rates Fall in Bond Market

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Treasury bond prices spurted higher and interest rates fell yesterday after a newspaper report that the Federal Reserve Board did not see an immediate need to raise interest rates.
The price of the Treasury's 30-year bond was up 9/32 , and its yield fell to 6.27 percent, from 6.29 percent on Thursday. 
 The report, in The Washington Post, said that a number of senior central bank officials felt inflation pressures were insufficient to warrant higher rates. That helped allay concerns among many traders and investors who have come to believe that the Fed would nudge short-term yields higher early next year.
The sentiment has depressed bond prices in recent months, since higher rates on newly sold securities would hurt the value of bonds already sold, which pay a fixed rate of return.
The Fed's monetary policy-making panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, meets next week to discuss the direction of interest rates.
Treasury prices initially rose during Tokyo trading, which begins before New York's session, and maintained their gains in New York.
However, some analysts said reaction to The Post article was muted because rumors of its publication circulated in the market on Thursday. Among the rumors was that the Fed's vice chairman, David W. Mullins Jr., had told The Post that the central bank would hold the line on interest rates for six months. In fact, the article cited comments from a speech he gave last week, not an interview, and did not mention a timetable.
Kathleen Camilli, chief economist at Maria Fiorini Ramirez Inc., said her firm had circulated the rumors on its electronic wire on Thursday morning. The wire goes out to 330 clients in 38 countries. She said she heard the rumors from three financial traders.
She said that turned bond prices around for the next 24 hours, but that by Sunday night, "we'll have something else to trade off of."
Also countering market enthusiasm was a Government report that housing starts jumped 3.9 percent in November. The report added to evidence that the economic recovery accelerated this quarter, raising the specter that inflation could increase from this year's level of roughly 3 percent. Inflation can diminish the value of fixed-income securities.
Yields on three-month Treasury bills were higher at 3.09 percent as the discount was up 0.01 percentage point at 3.03 percent. Six-month yields held at 3.31 percent as the discount was unchanged at 3.22 percent. One-year yields were lower at 3.56 percent as the discount fell 0.02 point to 3.43 percent.
The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 2 7/8 percent, down from 31/16 percent late Thursday.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 10310/32 , up 1/32 from late Thursday. The average yield to maturity was unchanged at 5.58 percent.

HEADLINE: Judges in Trenton Reject Sports Betting Plan

BYLINE: By JOSEPH F. SULLIVAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
The two-year campaign by the 12 casinos in Atlantic City to legalize sports betting ended today when State Supreme Court ruled that such an extension of gambling would need voter approval under the State Constitution.
A bill to place the question before the voters on Nov. 2 cleared the State Senate but was blocked in the Assembly. The Casino Association of New Jersey last month asked the Casino Control Commission, which regulates the industry, to approve sports betting through regulation. The commission said it lacked such authority, and its position was upheld last week by an appeals court and today by the state's highest court. 
 "Obviously, we're disappointed," the lawyer for the casinos, Joel H. Sterns, said. "It's the end of the legal battle."
The casinos had until Jan. 1 to obtain state approval under the Federal Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, which last year barred states that did not already have some form of sports betting from approving it in the future. Before final passage the bill was amended to allow New Jersey an extra year to decide whether it wanted sports betting because of the interest of the casinos.
 
'We Had Aa Tremendous Opportunity'
 "We had a tremendous opportunity to gain a competitive advantage that no other state had by approving sports betting in a state that has widespread illegal gambling on sports anyway," Mr. Sterns said.
Although the opportunity expires on Jan. 1 the casino operators are expected to continue to try to obtain a bipartisan expression of support for their proposal, so that they can mount another attempt to reopen the issue in Congress.
The Supreme Court did not write its opinion, but unanimously adopted the decision written by Judge Arnold M. Stein of the Appellate Division of Superior Court. Judge Stein wrote, "Except for constitutionally authorized simulcast horse-race betting, gambling casinos may operate only those games conducted solely in-house." Under simulcasting, casino customers can bet on races at tracks here and elsewhere.
The casinos based their request for approval by the casino commission on regulations in force in Las Vegas, Nev., where bets are taken on virtually all sports events, professional and amateur. The New Jersey proposal would not accept bets on contests in which a New Jersey school was a participant nor on election results.
The National Football League, the National Basketball Association, the National Hockey League and the Commissioner of Baseball fought the betting proposal in the Legislature and opposed it in the short-lived court test that ended today.
add betting
 
Billions in New Jersey Alone
 The defeat for the casinos here leaves Nevada with a virtual monopoly on the lucrative legalized sports-betting industry. Oregon has a sports lottery, and Delaware voters have approved wagering on athletic events, but state officials have not yet started that.
Officials of the Casino Association said that illegal sports betting in New Jersey alone was a $2.5 billion industry and that legalizing it would produce an extra $14 million a year in revenue for the state.
But the measure faced stiff opposition from the outset from amateur and professional sports alliances and leagues and from a host of legislators who worried that New Jersey was becoming too economically dependent on gambling revenues.
In a bid to win support the casinos backed off their initial demands that they be allowed to take bets on any college or professional sports activity and agreed instead to focus on just professional events. The proposed law would have also barred the casinos from taking bets by telephone, requiring gamblers instead to go to the casinos to place bets.

HEADLINE: New Pushcart Era Faces Old Threat;
Weak Sales and Low Prices Add to Problem of Paying Rent

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
It has been more than 50 years since Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia banned pushcarts, those mobile symbols of entrepreneurial initiative, from New York City streets.
Now the city is seeing the second rise -- and perhaps the second fall -- of pushcarts, with an important change. From bus and train terminals to the nooks and crannies of the World Trade Center to Citicorp office buildings in Manhattan and Queens to a Brooklyn shopping mall, the carts have gone inside. And they are big business. With access to thousands of scurrying commuters and shoppers in a good week, some post sales of more than $3,000. 
 But this has not been a good season, at least so far. Operators say sales are running way below last year, and they fear that they will not earn sufficient money to pay their rents. Rents for the holiday period are steep, running $700 to $1,200 a week, three times as high as the rest of the year.
"Nobody's stopping," said Kirit Sheth, who sells holographic pictures from a cart at an entrance to the Port Authority Bus Terminal on Eighth Avenue in midtown. "Everybody's running for the bus."
 
Wobbly Demand, Large Discounts
 Pesia Romeo, who sells Victorian sachets from a cart beneath the World Trade Center, said, "I invested a lot of money, and it doesn't look like I'm going to get it back this year."
The problem is the same one afflicting retailers from the suburban malls to the cluttered shops on the Lower East Side to catalogue sellers. Consumer demand remains wobbly, while merchants cannibalize one another with deeply discounted prices.
"The stores have reduced their prices so low that they are now competing with the prices on the pushcarts," said Arlen A. Penn, operations director for Ports of Call Management Inc., which runs pushcart programs for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Grand Central Terminal and other locations.
That means some vendors will be forced out of the pushcart business, at least temporarily. Ms. Penn said she expected at least seven of the 22 carts at the bus terminal to drop out after the holidays. But replacements seem eager to take their stalls at rents that will fall, to $175 to $300 a week. About 15 people are on the waiting list for the terminal.
Some people go into the pushcart business because they want to be their own boss, no matter what the scale. Some are looking to move up to real stores. Many are immigrants, willing to work endless hours and able to converse just enough to sell Christmas tree ornaments made from bread dough by South American Indians at three for $10.
"This is a good start, I would say," said Nelson Villasante, who sells T-shirts, sweat shirts and other clothing with Art Deco designs at the South Street Seaport, paying $500 a week for rent plus 15 percent of all sales over $2,900 a week. In some cases operators pay rent and commission to the owners of the buildings where they work and in other cases the money goes to specialized companies that recruit cart operators and act as intermediaries with managers of buildings where they do business.
Jack DeMarco, who sells plastic key chains and decorations from a cart at the Gallery at Metrotech in downtown Brooklyn, said: "If I make $300 in a day I'm doing very well. But if that shoe store makes $300 in a day he's bankrupt."
From the perspective of realty owners the carts represent extra revenue, a chance to offer untested merchandise in small quantities, a service to customers and a way to force out less desired activities like panhandling.
"They're a very, very convenient way for someone to shop," Jack Brendlen, a real-estate manager for the Port Authority, said. "And they displace negative activity."
Customers like the convenience and novelty. At a cart that sells nothing but products in the color purple, Purple Mystique at the Seaport, two women bought each other presents, a purple backpack and a purple hat. "This is the first time I ever bought from a pushcart," said one of them, Nancy Landis, a bartender. "It has a low-pressure appeal."
 
The Usual and the Unusual
 Some carts sell totally expected items like costume jewelry, compact disks or ties to commuters in desperate need of last-minute gifts. Others offer unusual items.
The Leftorium, a cart in the A. & S. Plaza at Herald Square, sells goods designed for left-handed people.
All the carts rely on convenience, low prices and sharp display to move merchandise briskly.
The director of the development office at Grand Central, Jeanne Giordano, likened the pushcart trend to the flowering of so-called superstores that offer vast quantities of goods, from books to bath towels, at low prices. "These are the two extremes of the same phenomenon," she said. "People want value, and carts offer incredible variety and low prices in a small space."
In their modern incarnation, carts are a phenomenon that originated in shopping malls, specifically with the Rouse Company Faneuil Hall development in Boston in 1976. Rouse's goal was to build a diffuse retail center with no big development stores for anchors in an area previously occupied by an open-air market. Many stores that the company approached were afraid of the concept and were reluctant to lease.
"Fast thinking is the mother of invention," a spokeswoman for Rouse, Cathy Lickteig, said. "We had to the bring the merchandise out to the people. So we put it on little carts."
Rouse has gone on to put 1,500 carts into 70 of its 78 shopping centers. "It's become a multimillion-dollar business for us," Ms. Lickteig said. At the South Street Seaport, a Rouse development, pushcart sales have at a 15 percent annual pace.
Peter Lembo, an associate general manager for the owner of the A. & S. Plaza, the Simon Company, said he had a waiting list of 45 people for one of two pushcart spaces.
A spokesman for the International Council of Shopping Centers, Keith Fox, estimated that the number of shopping carts in shopping centers nationally had doubled, to at least 27,000 over the last decade.
 
'One of the Best' at the Market
 Perhaps because failures simply disappear, success stories abound. Ossam Elbardissy, now 28, emigrated from Egypt six years ago, and opened a pushcart selling Broadway posters and paraphernalia at the South Street Seaport. He expanded to a store, kept the pushcart and added a cart with cartoon-related products.
"It was one of the best pushcarts in the market," he said of cart No. 1. "I'm very proud."
Another established vendor is Adrian van der Plas, whose business is called Fine Art a la Cart. For $15 to $500 he sells paintings with New York themes from a prime location at Pier 17 in the seaport. With the rent he pays, more than $2,500 monthly, he said he could easily lease a nice gallery in TriBeCa, where he lives, but chose not to.
"I'm building something here for many years to come," he said. "People find me and come back."
Other vendors have felt compelled to roam the malls of America in search of success
Mr. DeMarco has taken his acrylic key chains to Sarasota, Fla.; Richmond; Ocean County, N.J., and countless stops in between. "Sometimes the economy is down, and my business goes up, because I'm selling a low-priced item," he said. "See, everybody wants to spend money when they go to a mall, but they don't have to spend $90 for boots."
Another vendor who has moved around is Ms. Romeo, who lives on Staten Island, where friends make the sachets she has sold for a decade from a dreamily lighted pushcart. The display has been attractive enough to make people to look, but no more. "If everybody who sniffed my merchandise had given me a $1 it would have been a good season already," she said.
And the work can be vexatious. "People can get really nasty, and you have to be nice to them," said Lalou Assayag, 22, a singer and songwriter from Belgium who sells women's accessories at Grand Central.
But merchants could put up with crabby customers, if only they were buying. And that is what is not happening so far this season.
At the bus terminal Kimmy Wang, who immigrated from Beijing two years ago and who sells costume jewelry to support a husband conducting postdoctoral research in mathematics at Columbia University, said, "This business is no good."
Upstairs, Adnan Faruque, an immigrant from Bangladesh who turned to selling perfume from a pushcart after his photo store went bankrupt, said, "I'm very frustrated."
Ms. Penn of Ports of Call offered hope that things might improve in the final days of the season. "A last-minute shopper," she said, "won't go to a store and stand in line for an hour."

HEADLINE: Chip Fight Persisting With Japan

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 17

 BODY:
The American and European share of the Japanese computer-chip market is continuing to fall, making it likely that the United States will seek special trade talks with Japan early next year, American officials said today.
Preliminary estimates suggest that non-Japanese makers, most of those American, had 18 to 19 percent of the Japanese chip market in the third quarter, the lowest level in a year, a senior Administration trade official said today. 
 The figures throw a harsh light on trade friction with Japan, which persists despite the new world trade accord completed in Geneva this week under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
 
Provision for Consultations
 As a result of the continuing slide in foreign chip business, the United States is likely to invoke an "emergency consultations" provision of the 1991 Semiconductor Arrangement with Japan, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The United States will present specific proposals -- ways that Japan might open its computer chip market, but will not immediately raise the threat of sanctions, the official added.
The 1991 arrangement established a 20 percent goal of the Japanese market for foreign chip makers by the end of 1992. These companies reached 20.2 percent in the fourth quarter of last year, but the figure has since been falling. It was 19.6 percent in the first quarter of this year, and 19.2 percent in the second.
Third-quarter figures, scheduled for release next week, will probably fall between 18 and 19 percent, depending on a statistical review by Americans and Japanese here early in the week, the official said.
 
Another Foreign Policy Problem
 The figures present a political and diplomatic problem for the Clinton Administration, which wants to make more extensive use of numerical targets in trade agreements. It is seeking new agreements covering cars, car parts, insurance and government purchasing practices as part of a framework of negotiations set up during the summer in Tokyo. The framework calls for these agreements to be completed before Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa meets with President Clinton on Feb. 11.
Until now, no talks on computer chips had been scheduled other than routine meetings under the 1991 accord. But the American semiconductor industry is pushing for some sort of government action, and points out that American companies are gaining market share in the rest of the world. It argues that its share should not be falling in Japan "when it's headed up elsewhere in the world," as Andrew A. Procassini, president of the Semiconductor Industry Association in San Jose, Calif., put it.
Mickey Kantor, the United States trade representative, said in the spring that to prove that the fourth quarter 1992 figures were not a fluke, Japan should assure that American chip companies maintain an average market share of 20 percent through all of 1993.
However, Seiichiro Noboru, the top economics official at the Japanese Embassy, said talk of special consultations should wait until after the market-share figures are tallied next week.
The GATT accord just reached in Geneva emphasized tariff cuts. It did nothing to improve Japanese-American trade relations because the two countries already have very low tariffs. For instance, each charges no tariff at all on the other's computer chips. The long-lasting dispute between them over American access to the Japanese market has instead focused on charges of collusive business relationships between chip producers and chip users in Japan.
The first indication that the United States might seek special talks came in a little-noticed speech on Thursday by Charlene Barshefsky, the deputy United States trade representative for Asia. Ms. Barshefsky said the talks would be sought, but the senior Administration official said today that she had spoken without obtaining a consensus among agencies. However, the consensus will probably be to seek the consultations, the official acknowledged.
Stan Anderson, the American trade lawyer who represents Japanese chip makers, said the current attention to market share overlooked that American sales of chips in Japan were rising in dollar terms.
But Daryl Hatano, a trade expert at the Semiconductor Industry Association, said the increase reflected the increased value of the yen. And Michael C. Maibach, director of government affairs at the Intel Corporation, said that chip sales were rising around the world but that the 1991 agreement focused on market-share figures.
The Administration of President Ronald Reagan requested special talks in 1987 under the 1986 U.S.-Japanese Semiconductor Arrangement, which was replaced by the 1991 version with many of the same provisions. The 1987 talks failed to satisfy Mr. Reagan and his officials, who imposed 100 percent taxes on Japanese color television sets and power tools.
These punitive taxes, which covered $300 million a year in imports, were gradually lifted over the succeeding years and disappeared with the 1991 pact. They remain the harshest trade sanctions the United States has imposed on Japan since the end of World War II.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Above 110 Yen But Is Lower Against Mark

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar reached a five-month high against the Japanese yen yesterday, but it drifted against European currencies.
Gold prices also rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for February delivery, the most active futures contract, gained $1.40, to $388.90 an ounce. 
 The dollar pushed through 110 yen, a technical level that has proved a formidable barrier in the past, without fanfare. It peaked at 110.20 yen, its highest rate since July 12.
"There were no fireworks when the dollar went through 110," said Randolph Donney, senior research director at Pegasus Econometric. He said there was little enthusiasm to drive the dollar much higher, since trading volume thins considerably as the end of the year approaches.
"It's like trying to get a football game together with only four players," he said.
Nevertheless, dealers said the breach of 110 yen boded well for further gains in the dollar.
In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 110.19 yen, up from 109.56 yen on Thursday.
Technical factors depressed the yen against the mark, which in turn helped the German currency post gains against the dollar, dealers said.
They said the dollar's moves were largely dictated by gyrations in other currencies. There was little reaction to news that housing starts rose an impressive 3.9 percent in November to an annualized rate of 1.432 million units.
The dollar fell to 1.7075 German marks in New York, from 1.7105 marks late Thursday.
The British pound closed in New York at $1.4875, up from $1.4855 late Thursday.
The dollar did see some action against the Canadian dollar, which weakened after Standard & Poor's said that some Canadian provinces with negative outlooks could see their debt downgraded in the future.
The Bank of Canada reportedly bought Canadian dollars for United States dollars repeatedly to stem the slide. The dollar closed at $1.3405 (Canadian) in New York, up from $1.3330 (Canadian) on Thursday.
Other late dollar rates, compared with Thursday's quotes, included: 1.4590 Swiss francs, down from 1.4604; 5.8360 French francs, down from 5.8415, and 1,685 Italian lire, down from 1,689.

HEADLINE: Rifkin Unable To Heed Rights, Expert Testifies

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., Dec. 17

 BODY:
A psychologist who examined Joel Rifkin, the unemployed landscaper who has confessed to killing 17 women, said today that at the time of his arrest, Mr. Rifkin was "quite disturbed and incapable of understanding the Miranda warnings" that the state police read to him.
Dr. Naftali G. Berrill, a clinical psychologist at the New York Forensic Health Group in Brooklyn, said that Mr. Rifkin's judgment was "impaired" and his thinking "strained" on the morning of his arrest because he had not slept for three days and was suffering from depression. 
 He added that the fact that there was a dead body in Mr. Rifkin's house contributed to his deteriorating state. "The fact that there was a corpse in his house for three or four days made it so that his judgment was not quite clear," Dr. Berrill said at a pretrial hearing. Mr. Rifkin's lawyer is trying to have his confession and other evidence excluded from his pending murder trial.
Dr. Berrill, who said he offered his services to Mr. Rifkin's first lawyer, Robert Sale, after reading about the case in the newspaper, said he based his findings on school records, school psychologists' reports, and interviews with Mr. Rifkin, his mother, his sister, and two close friends, John Griselle and Christina Buffalino, Mr. Rifkin's ex-girlfriend.
The prosecutor, Fred Klein, challenged the documents on which Dr. Berrill based his testimony.
Producing them for the witness, Mr. Klein noted that the copies of the school records that were used by the psychologist were illegible, one lacked a letterhead, and that he had not pursued information about the psychologist Mr. Rifkin had seen when he was 17 and 18 years old.

HEADLINE: Repeal the Pol Tax

 BODY:
A politician's favorite tax is one that spares the home folks; for example, taxing hotel rooms. The victims are out-of-towners. Supposedly. But when the tax is so high that out-of-towners stay away, as is the case with New York City's tax, the victims are the home folks -- jobless hotel workers and every store, restaurant and pinball palace that does less business when visitors don't visit.
The tax in New York City averages 21.25 percent. It is the world's highest hotel tax, a distinction that carries no honor. Gov. Mario Cuomo has the power to correct this -- the power of leadership. He should call for a reduction in the tax in his budget next month, rather than leaving it to the Legislature, as he did last year. 
 The 21.25 percent represents the effect of five state and city taxes on an average room: the 4 percent state sales tax, the city's 4.25 percent sales tax, a $2 per night city tax on rooms costing $40 or more, a 6 percent city occupancy tax and, finally, a 5 percent tax the State Legislature imposed in 1990 on rooms over $100. If that latest tax were repealed, the city would still have the highest hotel tax in America, but it would be only marginally higher than other major cities, and close enough to be competitive.
The 5 percent state tax yields $73 million a year, a flyspeck in a $32 billion budget. More significantly, the city's hoteliers say state revenue would increase if the tax were repealed, because the city would get more conventions. They calculate that spending for the business of the conventions themselves, plus shopping and recreational spending by those who attend, would yield substantially more in sales taxes than the $73 million from the hotel tax.
While New York hotels are jammed to overflowing right now, that's Christmas. On the convention front business has plunged, from 890 meetings in 1988 to 594 this year. Spending by the conventions and their delegates has shrunk from $1.7 billion to barely $1 billion, according to the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau. The recession probably hurt the most, but the high cost of bedding down surely mattered; convention arrangers notice taxes, more than tourists who don't hear about the tax until they check out.
 Mayor-elect Rudolph Giuliani has promised to continue Mayor David Dinkins's pressure for repeal. If the Legislature and the Governor approve, the hotels must do their part by passing the tax cut through to their customers. The tax is too high, but there would be no gain from repeal if room rates climbed when the tax came down.

HEADLINE: Nigerians Prefer Military Rule to Chaos

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In response to your report on the new military Government in Nigeria (news article, Dec. 2):
A major objective of the Nigerian state is to develop stable and lasting democratic structures. The country has gone through problems and difficulties necessitating several military interventions. 
 But at no time did we give up the pursuit of the democratic objective. None of the military governments intended to remain in power indefinitely. All saw themselves as corrective regimes determined to restore peace and stability, and to chart a new course for political and economic development, based on democracy and free enterprise.
Thus, although most Nigerians prefer democratic rule, they almost invariably welcome military interventions, which they see as better than allowing the country to slide into chaos, with unpredictable consequences.
The military, for its part, rules in full consultations with the general public, by nationwide debates and setting up elected institutions to chart a new political future. In addition, the military runs the country in cooperation with civilians.
In the present military government led by Gen. Sani Abacha, all but two members of the 33-man cabinet are accomplished and experienced politicians and administrators, contrary to your quoted allegation that they are "all brawn, no brains." By deciding to include in his Government pro-democracy activists and to call for a constitutional conference, General Abacha has demonstrated he does not intend to stay in power indefinitely.
Moreover, all Nigerian military governments respect human rights and due process. It is true that some people are detained from time to time, but only if they are involved in criminal offenses, such as organizing riots, in which many innocent people lose their lives or property. But even such criminals are released after some time. Nigerian military regimes have never deliberately engaged in brutalities, large-scale repression and murder of political opponents. Freedom of speech and expression is always allowed.
Like many other countries, Nigeria is encountering serious economic problems. In our case, these are accentuated by our economic recovery program. But the standard of living of our people has risen considerably since independence, with the provision of electricity, pipe-borne water, hospitals and secondary schools in the rural areas during the military regimes that we had in the 1970's and 80's.

HEADLINE: ELLEN BAXTER

BYLINE: By DAVID C. ANDERSON; David C. Anderson writes about criminal justice, the homeless and other urban issues.

 BODY:
On a bright autumn morning, a crowd has gathered in front of one of New York City's most notorious places: the Fort Washington Armory, in upper Manhattan. In the worst years, on the coldest nights, as many as 1,200 homeless men would claim the cots set less than two feet apart on the cavernous drill floor. Crackheads, drunks, panhandlers, hustlers, muggers, burglars, sociopaths and psychopaths -- all were jammed in with runaway kids, the jobless and others down on their luck.
 But on this day, sparkling with promise, Mayor David N. Dinkins announces "a terrific proposal" for the armory. There won't be any more cots on the drill floor. Instead, it will be used once again for regional high-school track meets. A new tower above the armory will provide 200 low- and moderate-income apartments, youth and day-care centers, space for art programs and a community theater. 
 After a succession of city officials laud the redevelopment plan, a shy, diminutive woman with the Nordic features of a young Liv Ullmann approaches the microphone. She speaks for only a minute or two, nervously insisting to the assembled group, "This really happened because of you. This is your victory." But when she is done, the crowd of neighborhood leaders and residents erupts in cheers and applause. Over the years, people living near the Fort Washington Armory have learned to respect Ellen Baxter, who is perhaps the city's most accomplished not-for-profit entrepreneur.
To help the most distressed of the homeless population, Baxter has reinvented the single-room-occupancy (S.R.O.) residential hotels that once offered cheap lodgings to a collection of former mental hospital patients, aging pensioners and skid row bums. But unlike the old S.R.O. hotels despised by city planners as squalid warrens, Baxter's residences are well maintained and come with social service staffing.
Five of these "supported S.R.O.'s" now operate in Washington Heights, one of the city's more drug-ridden neighborhoods. Even with caseworkers on the premises five days a week, these residences are less expensive to operate than shelters like the Fort Washington Armory. A bed on the armory floor cost New York City more than $40 a night; a private room at one of Baxter's residences costs less than $20. This means that the $80 million or so that the city and state spend each year to provide minimal shelter for some 5,300 people could house thousands more in supported S.R.O.'s and also help many of them overcome the obstacles that caused their homelessness. Doing that for a few years might actually bring the problem of homelessness under control.
Although Baxter has insisted on integrating the most troubled homeless with everyone else, city officials have thus far resisted. They see the armory project as a way to relieve pressure on welfare hotels and shelters for homeless families and to increase the general supply of low- and middle-income apartments. People with "special needs," these officials contend, are incompatible with family life.
That disagreement aside, the Dinkins Administration did embrace the idea of turning major responsibility for the homeless over to nonprofit groups like the one headed by Baxter, the Committee for the Heights-Inwood Homeless. During the mayoral campaign Rudolph W. Giuliani, now the Mayor-elect, attacked the Dinkins Administration's overall approach to the homeless issue but also called for more supported housing.
Ellen Baxter's lesson reaches beyond New York City. The Corporation for Supportive Housing was established in 1991 in New York and now has $21 million in foundation grants. Its mandate: to jump-start supported housing for homeless people suffering from mental illness, addiction or AIDS. To date it has provided seed money and technical advice to nonprofit groups not only in New York but in Minneapolis, Chicago, Atlanta, the San Francisco Bay area and Connecticut.
WOMAN WHO FIERCELY guards her privacy, Ellen Baxter offers an interviewer only sketchy details of her personal life. She lives with Tony Hannigan, head of Columbia University Community Services, their 4-year-old son and her 14-year-old daughter. Last year, prompted by concern for the children's safety, they moved from New York City to Westchester. It was a painful decision, given Baxter and Hannigan's close ties to the Washington Heights neighborhood. "Our toddler would mimic the pop, pop, pop of gunshots and the sirens that followed." A police officer explained the shooting as a side effect of gun sales going on nearby, as customers test-fired their purchases.
The move has given Baxter the space for a flower garden, which she tends with care. Otherwise, she says, "we just try to lead a regular life." Weekends are devoted to catching up with her newspaper reading, going to movies and spending time with the kids.
Baxter's career as an entrepreneur began with a place called the Heights. Today it is one of the better-looking buildings on its block of West 178th Street -- the only one, certainly, with morning glory vines creeping from window boxes and up around the iron bars that protect the first-floor window.
The 55 residents of the Heights include the mentally ill, recovering substance abusers and those who for other reasons wound up on the streets. Their ages range from 24 to 74. Some will engage a visitor in animated conversation; others are painfully shy. Those with business on the outside -- medical appointments, classes, jobs -- come and go. Others prepare meals in the kitchens on each floor or gather for a staff-run bingo game in the common room off the entrance hall. A few keep to themselves in their rooms.
Though things seem peaceful enough, currents of tension rise and fall. From the day the place opened, in February 1986, Baxter and the social workers found themselves settling disputes over matters like the cleaning of the communal kitchens, thefts of food from the refrigerators, noisy neighbors, personality conflicts and gross neglect of personal hygiene.
These days Baxter spends less time at the Heights, as her other four residences in upper Manhattan also demand attention. (A total of 220 people live in her S.R.O.'s.) She spends the better part of her days maintaining contacts with neighborhood leaders and politicians, untangling bureaucratic red tape, fighting City Hall.
"Ellen looks like one of those quietly industrious women sewing in a shaft of sunlight in a Vermeer interior," says her friend Kim Hopper, a medical anthropologist. "But she has the instincts of a street fighter and the tenacity of a badger."
In the early 1980's Baxter and Hopper were working for the Community Service Society on a study of how the homeless survived in New York City. At the same time, Robert Hayes, a young corporate lawyer, was spending his spare time preparing to sue the city on behalf of homeless men. The three combined forces. Hayes finally forced the city to provide shelter on demand, but the victory turned sour as the city piled the homeless into shelters that offered neither privacy nor much control and that soon became nightmares of dirt, disease, danger and chaos.
In 1981, when the city suddenly turned the huge Fort Washington Armory into a shelter, Baxter mobilized her neighbors to support an alternative. If the razing of old S.R.O.'s by real-estate developers was one cause of the homeless problem, then a new kind of S.R.O. might offer a humane solution.
She sought help from Columbia University Community Services. (Created in the wake of the university's embarrassment over evicting people from old S.R.O.'s in Morningside Heights in order to build dormitories, the group is now known as the Center for Urban Community Services.) It brought together law, social work and architecture students to explore housing options for the homeless. They were put to work searching out possible sites and sponsors for a new S.R.O.
It took almost three years to open the Heights. Baxter's group, the Committee for the Heights-Inwood Homeless, was committed to developing a permanent residence. But a number of city officials, who still considered S.R.O.'s a disreputable form of housing however they were managed, opposed the idea.
Undeterred, Baxter obtained a list of vacant properties in the area from the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development. With no previous experience in real estate, she revealed an unexpected aptitude for entrepreneurship. She learned how to assemble supporters in the community and make sure they got the proper credit. She learned the art of tactical compromise. And she learned that in prolonged battles with city bureaucrats the person who never ever took no for an answer might well prevail.
Hopper and Hayes lent their advice. The Community Service Society kept Baxter on its payroll and provided a financial adviser. But it was Baxter who systematically worked her way through a maze of housing regulations and funding options.
Did a deputy mayor appear nervous about the level of neighborhood support? She worked the phone to produce letters of support from ministers, civic groups, a city councilman. Were prospective lenders interested but reluctant to take the plunge? She called and cajoled, keeping everyone aboard until someone finally made a commitment. Did a housing bureaucrat question whether the project qualified for city funds? She assembled legal opinions and found a state official to turn the obstructor around. Did a neighborhood group threaten opposition? She found the leaders, met with them and followed up with letters politely but forcefully refuting their objections.
In the meantime Baxter took a step that would be crucial to the eventual success of the Heights. She rented an apartment on West 174th Street to serve as a drop-in center. It offered the homeless a place to shower, pick up clean clothes, store belongings and get a meal. Two caseworkers were on hand as well. The homeless who began to appear were offered help finding treatment for drug or alcohol abuse, medical or psychiatric care, education and job training. With an address to receive a check in the mail, they could apply for benefits.
Baxter organized outreach teams to bring in would-be tenants for the new S.R.O. They found Jack Langford living at the end of a subway platform, with swollen, lacerated legs. He was persuaded to go to the hospital, where he was laid up for about two months. At first he was silent, but before long "he became very sociable," Baxter recalls. "So then all the people from the apartment started to go visit Jack at the hospital because it was something to do." When he was discharged, he refused to consider city shelters. So he was given a spare room at the 174th Street apartment. Today, Langford -- a painfully thin man who walks with the deliberate grace of a wading bird -- lives at the Heights in a room whose walls he has covered with magazine and newspaper fashion spreads.
In early 1986 all the pieces of the new S.R.O. came together: a building located on West 178th Street; a $1.2 million package of state, city and private money to acquire the place and create 55 single rooms with a kitchen and three bathrooms on each floor; a commitment from Columbia University Community Services to provide a resident social work staff; and a relatively cohesive group of people ready to move in. In February 1986 the new residence opened as the first S.R.O. in New York for single homeless people. Given a sense of place, safety and privacy, residents of the Heights could focus on the rest of their lives.
Baxter found that a supported S.R.O. permitted certain economies of scale. Accommodating several hundred homeless people in a huge hall requires legions of managers and guards -- who cost plenty even though they never seem to maintain order or security. In a supported S.R.O., each resident has a private room, social workers head off potential conflicts, and the more functional tenants are asked to work at the reception desk or patrol the corridors.
An S.R.O. can also take advantage of state and Federal revenues. Nearly every homeless person on the street qualifies for some kind of entitlement, from the city and state's home-relief allowance of $215 a month to more than $1,000 a month from the Federal Government for a disabled veteran. (The transient nature of living in a city shelter makes it difficult to capture much of this revenue.) At Baxter's S.R.O.'s, 30 percent of a resident's benefits or income goes to rent. In addition, such residences qualify for Federal housing funds that make up the difference between a tenant's contribution and market rent.
 UNTIL THE COURTS forced the city to limit the number of people it could send to the Fort Washington Armory, the shelter was a stark reminder of official policy failure every night of the year, as bus loads of the homeless arrived from downtown intake centers. Beyond the spiritual degradation, concentrating people at risk for AIDS and tuberculosis in a confined space of dirt, drug abuse and violence created a public-health horror show.
"The mattresses were all urinated on; they had bedbugs," recalls Carlos Pabon, a Heights resident who spent one night at the armory and never went back. "There were fights over cigarettes, fights over towels, clothes. Somebody might look at somebody else a little too hard and before you knew it there was a fight." Everyone worried about their sneakers or shoes. "What most guys would do is to lift up the bed and put one sneaker under each leg. So if somebody wanted your sneakers, they would have to lift the bed and you would wake up."
For Baxter the armory became the symbol of everything wrong with homeless policy -- the antithesis of what she had learned at a place called Geel (pronounced hail).
The Belgian village of Geel is home to the shrine of St. Dympna, patron saint of the mentally ill. Its residents have taken in mental patients as boarders since the late Middle Ages, and the town has evolved into a long-term experiment in community mental health care unique in the world. In 1975 Geel's population was 30,000, with some 1,000 families boarding 1,100 mental patients in their homes. That summer, a Geelian family also took in Ellen Baxter.
She was 21 years old and had just graduated from Bowdoin College in Maine. A psychology major, she had become interested in the movement against institutionalizing the mentally ill. During her sophomore year, she persuaded a psychiatrist to commit her to Augusta State Hospital, where she feigned symptoms for a week in order to experience institutional life. She found the treatment of inmates barbaric but left for another reason. "It bothered me that I was getting friendly with the other patients," she says. She didn't want to go on deceiving them.
In the course of her studies, she came across an article about Geel in The American Journal of Psychiatry. Baxter speaks Dutch, having attended high school in The Netherlands. (Her father, an engineer for an international firm, had moved his family around the world.) When she won a fellowship for a year of postgraduate study anywhere she chose, she headed for Geel.
The Geelians, she found, had no trouble accepting the occasionally bizarre behavior of their guests. "Some boarders really had remarkably deviant behavior, like screaming loudly, nonstop," she recalls. "Why didn't they consider offering the person some medication that would help control that?" The family would explain, "Well, we really don't believe in that. We're used to him. He's always been that way."
The average length of stay in Geel for a boarder with a host, Baxter found, was 23 years. The government had built a psychiatric hospital in town, but it was only for crises. Hosts were expected to make boarders part of their households, often trusting them to run errands and help care for the children.
Geel radicalized Baxter on the issue of care for the mentally ill. She had seen how easily a community could accept mental patients who were not violent or deeply depressed. Granting them basic dignity and a place in daily life left both the patients and the community better off.
SOMEWHAT GRUDGINGLY, the city began to recognize Baxter's pioneering efforts at the Heights. By 1987 the Mayor's office made capital financing available for supported S.R.O.'s. Baxter opened four more residences. The newest and largest is an apartment house called the Rio, whose facade gracefully follows the curve of Fort Washington Avenue as it merges into Broadway. Opened in late 1991, it has 82 units and its penthouse serves as Baxter's headquarters.
Others also took notice. In 1990 New York State signed an agreement with City Hall to cooperate in the financing and development of more supported S.R.O.'s. A judge ruling in a class action suit ordered city hospitals to stop discharging mental patients to the streets and instead insure that they find "stable housing with available supportive services."
Word spread to Washington. Aides to Jack F. Kemp, then Housing Secretary, came to New York to look at S.R.O.'s and were impressed by their economy and efficiency. A Federal Task Force on Homelessness and Severe Mental Illness also called for more supported S.R.O. housing.
The Clinton Administration promises active support. Henry G. Cisneros, the new Housing Secretary, considers homelessness his first priority. Soon after taking office, he drafted Andrew M. Cuomo as his Assistant Secretary for Community Development; Cuomo had written a report for Mayor Dinkins that emphasized principles similar to those guiding Baxter's work. But Cisneros has been bedeviled by bureaucratic impediments.
"We'll spend hours talking through a strategy for meeting all the objections to move our homeless initiative through the Office of Management and Budget and Congressional committees," he said recently. "Meanwhile it's dusk and people are starting to bed down for the night -- for one more night in the park outside the window."
What sustains Baxter in the face of similar frustrations?
To anyone who has spent time with her, the answer is clear. It lies in her sense of the homeless as unique individuals -- the Jack Langfords and the Stella Levines.
Asked why she named her second residence the Stella, Baxter recalls the middle-aged heroin addict she found sleeping in a bus terminal restroom. Levine would become one of the founding tenants of the Heights, living there until her death, from cancer, in 1987. Thin and barely five feet tall, she dressed in flashy colors, heavy jewelry and makeup. She was a friendly, generous soul, often bringing to her housemates gifts of objects she had picked up on the street. When angered, she could curse like a Marine.
"Although she continued to have her problems with drug abuse," Baxter says, "Stella was a survivor." She had a spirit that deserved to be honored, a name that deserved to live on.

HEADLINE: Out Man in a Mig

BYLINE: By Peter Passell; Peter Passell writes about economics and other subjects for The New York Times.

 BODY:
MY FIRST LOOK AT POST-SOVIET AVIation was not confidence-building. From the rusting outhouse to the old planes lining the Tarmac in various stages of cannibalization, the little airfield some 100 miles west of Moscow might have been home to a fly-by-night crop-duster in a 1940's B movie.
Why, then, am I -- the sort who buckles his seat belt to move the car in the driveway -- perched on a bench in the tumbledown flight-operations center, struggling to memorize the three ways to trigger a VS-1-BRI rocket-assisted aircraft ejection seat? 
 It all started with an advertisement in a half-dozen newspapers known to be read by large numbers of 25- to-59-year-old males with considerable discretionary income. "Fly a MIG-29 at Mach 2.5 in Moscow (no, really)," it teased. And like several hundred other latter-day Walter Mittys, I phoned the advertiser, a company called MIGS Etc., in Sarasota, Fla.
Yes, really, insisted Kent Ertugrul, a former software entrepreneur and partner in MIGS Etc. Rides in the MIG-25, MIG-29, MIG-31 and Sukhoi-27 -- collectively the pride of the Soviet military-industrial complex -- were indeed available, starting at $9,945 plus air fare to Moscow. No, the Russian Air Force had not been privatized by peaceniks who decided to skip the plowshare stage and go straight to the theme park. The handful of Russian state enterprises that designed and tested high-performance aircraft, Ertugrul explained, were feeling underappreciated in the new world order and thus eager to show off their wares to opinion makers and potential customers. Anyone in reasonable health with $9,945 to spend fit the profile.
A few days later I was struggling into a helmet and an oxygen mask, wondering why I hadn't managed to come up with a tamer way to work through midlife crisis.
In fact, the preflight jitters soon evaporated. My cheerful pilot, Arkady, a former air force instructor, radiated competence. And one glance at the Czech-made L-39 subsonic-jet trainer, a savory before the main-course MIG, instantly transformed me into an aerospace groupie. The needle-nosed little plane, with its compact, rakish wings, pressurized cockpit and green camouflage paint, looked ready to boogie.
It was. Moments after the starter-motor whine of the engine turned to a gentle roar, the L-39 was in the air and punching through the clouds. Arkady leveled off at 15,000 feet and spent a few minutes demonstrating how the stick tilted the plane left and right, up and down. Then, stretching his knowledge of English to the limit, he ordered me to "take controls."
Believe it or not (I don't), I did. And was it fun! Or as Sarah MacT. Davidson, a 32-year-old New York investment banker and the other satisfied MIGS Etc. customer that day, later put it: "Was it as good for you as it was for me?"
The L-39 responded instantly to a nudge, swooping like a hawk in the winter sunshine. There was no sound but the authoritative growl of the engine occasionally changing pitch as the pilot throttled forward and back to keep me out of trouble.
Now it was time for Arkady to show what the plane could really do: a shallow dive to build speed to 400 miles an hour, then a steep climb until the plane was on its back and once again plummeting toward the snow-covered fields below. The G (gravity) meter registered 4 at the max, sufficient to paralyze my extremities with a crushing but curiously benign weight. Next a slow 360-degree roll to the left followed by one to the right, a maneuver I had been dreading on behalf of my inner ear. The rotation of the horizon was indeed disorienting but not in the least sickening -- courtesy of the Dramamine taken as a prophylactic or perhaps the natural endorphins left over from my interlude as a bird of prey.
Back to Earth for a cup of tea, a tuna salad sub and sign language chatter with the Russian flight instructors, who did not conceal their delight in our delight. In the helicopter returning to Moscow, the iron-gray sky seemed friendlier, the dead November farmland almost inviting. Could the MIG be anything but anticlimax?
In a word: yes.
The plane I wanted and expected to fly was the one I'd heard most about: the supersonic MIG-29, an incredibly maneuverable twin-engine fighter designed to go missile-to-missile with the American F-16. But this is the New Russia, where everything is possible and nothing is certain. One of the two MIG-29's stationed at the Zhukovsky aircraft test center, 30 miles south of Moscow, was on the way to the Dubai Air Show; the other was in the shop. So the Test Pilot Institute, which shares the Zhukovsky center with the elite Mikoyan, Sukhoi and Tupelov aircraft design bureaus, rolled out something equally exotic on short notice: a MIG-25 (NATO code-named Foxbat).
Before being permitted to fly, Sarah Davidson and I endured exhausting (if not exhaustive) medical exams followed by a four-course meal in the private dining room where Politburo biggies must have been feted before viewing the latest machines of mayhem (we nibbled on the rolls). That left maddeningly little daylight for thrills and chills. But a little proved a lot.
The MIG-25 is a plane unlike any other, a long-range, ultrahigh-altitude interceptor whose steel, titanium and aluminum body is at once crudely menacing and muscularly beautiful. Oversize rectangular air-intakes feed two turbojets capable of 48,000 pounds of thrust -- more power than a 100-passenger Boeing-737 and sufficient to push the MIG-25 past 1,800 miles an hour. Pilot and passenger sit above the heat-scorched snout, isolated from the beast's business parts.
I snuggle into a streamlined glass aerie normally reserved for the cameraman on reconnaissance missions. Trussed tight to the ejection seat, lifelines attached for oxygen, radio and inflatable anti-G suit, we taxi ponderously to the end of the 20,000-foot runway. Yevgeny, the pilot, pushes the throttles to 100 percent with the brakes locked, shouts "O.K., Pee-tur?" in the intercom and lets it rip.
My high-tech steed explodes forward on the supercharged power of its afterburners, trailing cones of blue-white fire. Up, up we climb at a 45-degree angle, the altimeter registering another 1,000 meters every few seconds. The MIG passes the speed of sound without a shiver, eventually leveling off at 60,000 feet. I am safe, serene in a quiet bubble, hurtling 1,500 miles an hour at the edge of space. Only the 200-degree heat of the glass canopy (which I have been warned not to touch) offers a clue to the rage of the elements clawing to get in.
Yevgeny gives me a few minutes to contemplate the black sky above and the ocean of beige clouds 10 miles below. A sunset, with perfect spectral bands from red to green to blue, highlights the curvature of the Earth. Then he tilts into a wrenching supersonic arc to the right; the Foxbat shudders for the first and only time as he adjusts the controls, gradually descending and slowing the plane to 500 miles an hour.
We skim the surface of the clouds, feathery wisps whipping by at unimaginable speed. Now the unexpected snap of a roll that barely takes more than an instant; now another and another. Yevgeny dives through the mist and buzzes the landing strip at 200 feet before accelerating into a hard, climbing turn on afterburner.
We circle the field and touch down with a delicate kiss to the concrete. Elapsed flying time: 36 minutes -- long enough to burn 2,500 gallons of kerosene, specially modified for high-altitude flight. I am poised between euphoria and post-adventure tristesse.
Is less than an hour in a MIG worth the $10,000-plus price? Is 1945 Chateau Latour worth $50 a sip? It is a matter of taste -- and, of course, how hard the money might be to come by.
For Sarah Davidson, who has been in love with fast airplanes since she was a teen-ager and eager to be the first non-Russian woman to fly a MIG, the calculus was easy. Most of MIGS Etc.'s clients fit the same mold: young professionals in search of adventure. But would-be jet jockeys are everywhere: Ertugrul reports that one of his next customers is a French parking lot attendant who has borrowed the cash deposit.

Visits to Peru Rebound As Obstacles Fade

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE

DATELINE: LIMA, Per

 BODY:
STARTING in 1988, three scourges of a happy vacation cholera, hyperinflation and terrorist violence -- kept tourists away from Peru. But recently and without great fanfare, cholera and inflation have come under control and guerrilla violence has waned. Today, visitors are beginning to venture back to the land of the Incas.
For the first time in five years, foreign arrivals are up in Peru. Since April, 150,000 foreign visitors have come here -- a 36 percent rise over the same period last year.
Tourism's resurgence in Peru is most noticeable in Cuzco, where the number of foreigners buying tour packages increased this summer by 50 percent, to 9,500, according to the National Chamber of Tourism, a Lima-based organization. Betting on a long-term recovery, Lima's largest hotel, El Libertador, is doubling its capacity to 250 rooms. 
 "My business is up 70 percent this year," said Alfredo Ferreyros Gildemeister, president of Explorandes, a Lima travel agency with a largely foreign clientele.
Europeans and Latin Americans account for most of the new visitors. Americans still shy away, in part because of stark warnings by the United States Government. Issued in May, the latest State Department travel advisory begins: "U.S. citizens are warned against travel to Peru until further notice. With the exception of certain tourist areas, terrorist violence continues to affect a large part of the country."
Adding exclamation points to the travel advisory, guerrillas in late October exploded bombs at Lima's airport and at a Lima hotel. No tourists were wounded. But Peruvians, and many foreigners, increasingly say they are convinced that tourism will rebound strongly in the late 1990's. The World Bank is preparing a $35 million loan to rehabilitate the railroad from Cuzco to Machu Picchu. South Korea's Government is financing an $18 million renovation of Cuzco's airport.
By the end of next year, Peru's free-market Government plans to have sold all its state-owned hotels. Sprinkled over 39 towns and cities, the hotels are attracting inquiries from foreign investors, according to Alonso Rey, a lawyer who is directing the privatization program. An "open skies" airline deregulation program has already prompted a doubling in domestic air traffic in five years, he said. Pushing down air fares and extending scheduled service to 23 cities, the number of private airlines had increased from two in 1988 to eight today. Thanks to deregulation, foreign visitors can now skip Lima and enter Peru through the back door -- Cuzco, an Andean city reknown for its charming mix of colonial churches and Inca ruins. Tourists may want to avoid Lima, a grimy, overpopulated city that endures roughly half the terrorist incidents in the country.
For Andean tourists, Aeroperu inaugurated two weekly flights in October among La Paz, Bolivia and Cuzco.

HEADLINE: In Glenn Close, 'Sunset Boulevard' Finds Its Megastar

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY

 BODY:
ONE THING WAS PERfectly clear the other night in Los Angeles, at least inside the Shubert Theater.
When the curtain came down on the last preview performance of "Sunset Boulevard," Andrew Lloyd Webber's elaborate, neo-Gothic musical adaptation of Billy Wilder's classic 1950 film, Glenn Close had suddenly become a big, exciting new star of the American musical theater of the 1990's. 
 It's not as if Ms. Close were unknown on the stage. She's a two-time Tony Award winner (for "The Real Thing" and "Death and the Maiden") and received warm reviews for her work in the 1980 Broadway musical "Barnum." "Sunset Boulevard" is something else. Her performance catapults her into the sphere of megastars. As the show serves her with material that effects a career transformation, she serves the show. Though not quite single-handedly, she takes the role of Norma Desmond, the demonic, reclusive silent-film queen whom Gloria Swanson made so dauntingly memorable, and fiercely shapes it into her own unexpected image.
This isn't a Glenn Close you have ever seen in movies. There have been hints of her reserves of power in "Dangerous Liaisons," "Reversal of Fortune" and even in "Fatal Attraction." Yet nothing she has done comes near the commanding figure she creates in this new Lloyd Webber extravaganza, which, with Patti LuPone as Norma Desmond, opened in July in London to mixed reviews.
Ms. Close's performance is ravishing. Her looks astonish -- the high cheekbones, the Rooseveltian jaw, the eyes staring out from the pale face beneath a thick layer of mascara. She somehow manages to suggest Lon Chaney's silent-screen Phantom of the Opera, and even the one in Mr. Lloyd Webber's long-running Broadway chestnut, without sacrificing either her beauty or her intelligence as an actress. She is no belter in the manner of Ms. LuPone. Yet her singing voice is lovely and strong, the phrasing capturing Norma's merciless determination and self-serving wit. If the lyrics tend to blur in moments of high melodrama, it's more because of the vagaries of stage mikes and the uncertain science of sound amplification in today's musical theater. Say this for Ms. Close: Her diction is far better than Joan Sutherland's.
Most important, the actress inhabits every square inch of the Shubert's immense stage with mesmerizing authority. She wears the space with the same elegant self-assurance with which she wears her succession of extraordinary outside-of-time Anthony Powell costumes. It's as if, like Norma Desmond, she knows that the rest of the world exists only as "all those wonderful people out there in the dark," that is, as an audience whose sole function is to attend her with adoration.
Ms. Close's triumph seems certain to complicate the question of who'll be playing Norma if the $10 million show comes to Broadway next fall. Though Ms. LuPone is under contract to play the role in New York, there's bound to be pressure now to bring in the star of the Los Angeles company.

 Mr. Lloyd Webber's "Sunset Boulevard" is not Billy Wilder's, though Trevor Nunn, the director, and Don Black and Christopher Hampton, who wrote the book and lyrics, appear to have adapted the film with something like abject fidelity. In fact, Mr. Lloyd Webber and his associates have subtly (some will say unforgivably) shifted the emphasis in transferring the film to the big stage.
What was once an evilly skeptical, bitter melodramatic comedy about Hollywood's self-infatuation has been turned into something quite other. This "Sunset Boulevard" is not a tragedy, though it ends badly. It's a melodramatic romance that buys the old fan magazine nonsense about how much great stars suffer to brighten the lives of us little people.
The real shocker is that with Ms. Close as Norma Desmond it works.
I'm aware that Mr. Wilder, who has seen the musical twice, has been quoted as saying that he loves the stage production but thinks the collaborators could have profited by being less reverent toward his work. To the extent that Mr. Lloyd Webber and company recreate the film virtually scene by scene, sometimes famous line by famous line, Mr. Wilder is right.
The show's first image, which is a stunner, comes directly from the film. The audience, as if huddled on the bottom of Norma Desmond's swimming pool, stares up at the body of Joe Gillis (Alan Campbell) floating face down on the pool's surface. With three bullets in him, Joe is quite dead but, out-of-work B-picture writer that he is, he won't shut up.
With Joe supplying the narration, there follows a frenzied succession of sequences, full of split-second scenery changes and numbing Lloyd Webber recitative (often in doggerel), that do with great labor what movies do effortlessly. They set up the time (1950), the place (Hollywood) and the initial circumstances that put Joe and Norma onto a course of fatal collision, much in the manner laid out in the screenplay by Mr. Wilder and his partner, Charles Brackett.
Yet Mr. Lloyd Webber and his collaborators veer off in their own direction after the first meeting of Norma and Joe. This is a scathingly funny sequence, and the only time when the romantic aims of Mr. Lloyd Webber and the satiric ones of Mr. Wilder coincide: Joe, being chased by repo men who are after his car, has turned into a Sunset Boulevard driveway. Having hidden his car in what he later learns is the Desmond garage, he finds himself mistaken for the undertaker who has been summoned to bury Norma's pet chimpanzee.
THE SCENE TAKES PLACE IN the centerpiece of John Napier's eye-popping production design, the cavernous drawing room of Norma's old Sunset Boulevard mansion. Almost as high as the nave of Notre Dame de Paris, the drawing room suggests the main lobby of the old Roxy Theater, being all tarnished gilt with plaster pillars that are vaguely Aztec and a little bit Sumerian but mostly 1920's picture-palace Renaissance. There are also a tile floor ("Valentino said tile is for tango," Norma tells Joe later on), a pipe organ, a massive sofa and a grand stairway that curves upward toward the loges. The only thing missing is a drinking fountain and a glass tube of Dixie cups.
As Joe looks on in awe, the imperious Norma stands by the makeshift bier, mourning her dead ape in a sweetly simple Lloyd Webber melody, with lyrics that are passionately inappropriate. The song is called "Surrender" and, in this time and place, it's both a howl and crazily affecting. Norma sings of the trials of life (the chimp's and of hers) in terms of wars, of battlefields, of tracer bullets lighting up the sky, and of the peace that comes only with surrender. She sings that she won't see her beloved again until she surrenders, which is something she has no intention of doing any time soon.
Mastering her grief, she sizes up the handsome, needy young Joe and hires him to work on her script about Salome, which is to be her return to the screen. For the money she's paying, she also expects him to share her bed. Joe becomes restive only when he doesn't see any money. Instead, Norma showers him with expensive clothes, champagne, caviar and a gold cigarette case. Though rich and slightly mad, Norma is a tightwad, one of the reasons she has held onto her money over the years.

 Yet Mr. Lloyd Webber's "Sunset Boulevard" doesn't simply pity Norma, as Mr. Wilder's does, it also salutes her crazy grandeur. It recognizes that in 1950, Norma, at age 50, would be only 20-some years past her peak. As Joe tells Norma, "There's nothing wrong with being 50, unless you are acting 20." But in the silent-film era in which Norma is locked, youth is all.
The musical also recognizes that the technological divide between silent and sound films has marooned her, left her isolated on the far side of a metaphorical Grand Canyon. Mr. Lloyd Webber agrees when first Norma, and later Max von Mayerling (George Hearn), her butler, former director and ex-husband, sing that they gave the world "new ways to dream."
Mr. Wilder's "Sunset Boulevard" doesn't sentimentalize Norma Desmond. It seems to understand (without saying so) that it was Edison, among others, who gave the world new ways to dream. The Norma Desmonds, Mary Pickfords and Gloria Swansons were just the figures with which those dreams were illustrated, at no great hardship to themselves, for enormous fame and large pots of money.
But over and over again Mr. Lloyd Webber's "Sunset Boulevard" salutes Norma's mad courage and her delusions. Her cuckoo dreams are encouraged. And in numbers such as "Surrender," "With One Look" and "The Greatest Star of All," he makes a convincing case for his romantic view of human nature and movie history.
Mr. Lloyd Webber's score is a good one, though the handful of songs is so shamelessly reprised you suspect it might be the music that's pushing Norma over the edge, not Fate, and not the feckless Joe's clandestine pursuit of someone else. Possibly nothing in the score is as witty as Mr. Lloyd Webber's melodic doomy overture. It, too, is repeated in one form and another throughout the rest of the show.
The overture evokes every movie score, great and schmaltzy, ever written by those exotically named screen composers of my youth: Miklos Rozsa, Bronislau Kaper, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Max Steiner, and Franz Waxman, the man who actually wrote the music for the Wilder film, though it sounds nothing like Mr. Lloyd Webber's.
Mr. Hearn sings beautifully while giving a wonderful interpretation of Erich von Stroheim's screen performance as Max von Mayerling. All the other voices are first-rate, including Mr. Campbell's, but the actor seems a very lightweight Joe Gillis. Unlike William Holden, who played Joe in the film, Mr. Campbell looks like a juvenile out of a musical of the 40's or 50's, someone without any concept of the terrors of economic desperation or, for that matter, of the joys of sleazy opportunism. The time devoted to Joe's relationship with Betty Schaefer (Judy Kuhn), the pretty, sweet, utterly vacuous script reader, is time wasted. So is almost every scene set outside Norma's mansion, away from Ms. Close.
The show's coup de theatre occurs as Mr. Napier effectively splits the stage in two, horizontally, when Joe abandons Norma on New Year's Eve to go to a party given by his impoverished peers. At that moment, the entire Sunset mansion set, still containing a hysterical, champagne-swilling Norma and her faithful Max, magically levitates to reveal, below, the cramped little apartment containing Joe's heedless merrymaking peers. You're allowed to say "Wow!"
Will "Sunset Boulevard" become a Lloyd Webber super-hit on the order of his "Phantom of the Opera"? As someone who could barely sit through "Phantom," and who, when the chandelier softly plummeted, felt cheated (no blood or mangled tiaras in sight), I would say that "Sunset Boulevard" delivers almost everything it promises. It has class.
Yet to achieve the kind of longevity enjoyed by "Phantom" and "Cats," "Sunset Boulevard" must be perceived as a family show, which it definitely isn't. It's going to be a hard matinee sell for toddlers and all other pre-adolescents.
'My Fair Lady'
Toddlers and pre-adolescents were much in evidence at the Sunday matinee I caught of the sleepy, newish revival of "My Fair Lady," directed by Howard Davies, of the Royal National Theater in London. The children spent much of their time running up and down the aisles of the Virginia Theater, where the musical, having been on the road for nearly eight months, is now catching 40 winks. Should the youngsters have accidentally looked at the stage at any point, their innocence was safe: Shaw's subversive wit is still effectively disguised in the glorious Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe work.
This is a touring show and looks it. It's rather small and efficient, in spite of a scenic design "based on original designs by Ralph Koltai," with the assistance of Mr. Davies and (unbilled) of Heidi Landesman. Their collaborative touch is most evident in the rather surreal Ascot scene in which the Ascot crowd descends on individual swings from above. The image is handsome but spare.
Another odd touch in the otherwise plain production: Henry Higgins's laboratory, featuring a lot of Dr. Frankenstein-like test tubes and other glassware, plus a giant model of a human head, the brain and the vocal organs outlined in neon. The point seems to be that, like Frankenstein, linguist Higgins is challenging God in making a new woman of Eliza Doolittle. Oh, please.
RICHARD CHAMBERLAIN GIVES a reasonable facsimile of Rex Harrison's unbeatable performance as Higgins, while seeming to remain detached from everyone around him. Melissa Errico has a lovely voice, a pretty-doll face and little stage presence. The reliable Paxton Whitehead plays Colonel Pickering, Julian Holloway (Stanley's son) plays Alfred P. Doolittle, and Robert Sella is Freddie Eynsford-Hill, the penniless twit who courts Eliza.
There's nothing terribly wrong with the production, and nothing surprisingly right. It lacks urgency and, in its Henry Higgins and Eliza Doolittle, heart.
In his chatty afterword to "Pygmalion," the source of the musical, Shaw says that following the play's end, Eliza should marry not Higgins but foolish Freddie. This may be the only production of "My Fair Lady" to convince you that Shaw was right.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN TOKYO

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER; DAVID E. SANGER is head of the Tokyo bureau of The Times.

 BODY:
If Asia has a capital city, Tokyo is it. From the air and even from the highway, it may look like an unrelieved ode to urban gray, but at ground level it is one of the most bustling and international cities in the Far East, and in some ways the most deceiving. The apparent Western air -- the glitzy boutiques in the Ginza, the English-language signs everywhere -- leads many visitors to the quick conclusion that this is a familiar place, albeit one so sprawling that getting around is a bit intimidating. In fact, getting around is a cinch, with an outstanding subway and train system. The hard part is sorting out the two Tokyos -- the caffeine-charged city of all-day business and all-night drinking, and quiet neighborhoods where old men in their yukata robes and geta, or clunky wooden sandals, make their way back home from the public baths.
Most visitors spend their time in the high-tech and Western Tokyo, from the electronics shops of the Akihabara district, stocked with goods that have yet to hit America, to the coffee shops filled with young people who seem to feel equally at home in New York, Honolulu or the Ginza. But it is still worth searching for the tiny enclaves of the second city. That is where the few remaining geisha alight from rickshaws and head for the ryotei, or private restaurants of the wealthy and powerful, and you are left standing in wonder at the hidden life. 
 The latter Tokyo, the Tokyo from the wonderful lithographs of the city as Westerners first discovered it 130 years ago, gets harder to find every year. There are far fewer women in kimono on the subways than just five years ago; the old wooden houses in many neighborhoods are falling to wrecking balls, in favor of Western comforts. But if you are willing to wander, particularly in the out-of-the-way neighborhoods that seem to live independently of much of the city, the remnants of Edo are still there to sample.
Unfortunately, never before has the prospect of visiting Tokyo seemed so financially daunting as it does these days. Since the spring, the dollar has hovered at record-weak levels, around 105 to 107 yen to the dollar, making the normally outrageous expense of visiting the city even worse.
But there is hope. The surprisingly severe economic downturn in Tokyo has not cast many people into the street, but it has resulted some bargains -- discounts at major stores, better prices on set-course meals at restaurants.
The usual rules apply: Eat what the Japanese eat, stay out of hotel shops and restaurants, be willing to get lost.
You will never be far from a subway entrance, and there is no safer city in the world. And the best part of Tokyo, the life on the streets and the temple grounds, is free.
 
Events
 The New Year's holiday, one of the most magical periods to be in Tokyo, offers a tremendous variety of special events. On Dec. 23, the Emperor's birthday, and again on Jan. 2, the public is allowed into the grounds of the Imperial Palace; the rest of the year only the gardens are open. The royal family greets everyone, from a distance of course, from 9:30 A.M. to 11 A.M. On Dec. 27 to 29 there is a year-end fair, called Toshi-no-Ichi, at Yagenbori Fudoson Temple right near Higashi-Nihonbashi Station, and another on Dec. 28 at Meguro Fudoson Temple, near Meguro Station. Those fairs have everything from food to stalls selling old wares; they are usually open until late at night, when the trains stop.
"Omisoka," or New Year's Eve, the whole city heads out to neighborhood temples, to hear 108 peals of the temple bell at midnight. One of the best celebrations, full of smiling Buddhist priests and great food stalls and sake, is at Zojoji Temple; go to Onarimon, Shiba-Koen or Daimon Stations, and follow the crowds. Other famous celebrations are at Gokokuji Temple by the subway station of the same name, and at Sensoji near Asakusa, but even a small neighborhood temple will be full of charm, as residents build bonfires and bring their pets to be blessed.
On the days just after New Year's, many Tokyo residents -- foreigners and Japanese alike -- take an annual trek to "Shitamachi," literally the "low city," the center of Tokyo life until a century and a half ago. It is on the far side of the river from Asakusa, and the neighborhood is littered with small temples that each have a long connection in the history and mythology of the area.
At each temple, you purchase, for about $4 each, seven minature "lucky gods," made of pottery. Some are gods of health, some are gods of happiness and many are gods of wealth.
During the year you place them on a small model boat intended to carry you with good luck through the new year.
Start by crossing the big bridge at Asakusa over the Sumida River, turn left under the highway and then right around the huge building with the giant radish sculpture on top, and follow the crowds to Mimeguri Jinja, or shrine.
There are a few posted maps of the route to the rest of the temples. The whole walk takes about two and a half hours, maybe a bit longer if you dawdle over a hot bowl of noodles along the way, and winds through a charming neighborhood of Tokyo that most tourists never visit.
 
Where to Stay
 The boxy but efficient Shiba Park Hotel, phone 3433-4141, fax 5470-7519, has a wonderful location near the Daimon subway stop and Shiba Koen, one of the nicer parks in downtown. Units in the 400-room hotel run about $220 and up for two.
In a similar price range, the Takanawa Prince Hotel, built on the site of the home of a former member of the imperial family; it shares a wonderful Japanese garden with the New Takanawa Prince next door, a modern, 946-room hotel popular among tour groups. It is in the southern part of the city near Shinagawa Station; phone 3447-1111, fax 3446-0849.
The Fairmont Hotel, phone 3262-1151, fax 3256-2476, is right on the edge of the moat of the Imperial Palace, a great place for jogging enthusiasts. It has 208 rooms, which start at about $190 for two.
Budget: The Y.M.C.A., in Mitoshiro-cho, phone 3293-1911, fax 3293-1926, has 40 small but new rooms; twins start at $180. And the location is excellent, surrounded by good book shops and noodle joints.
Right in the middle of the Ginza is Hotel Atamiso, 4-14-3 Ginza, phone 3541-3621, fax 3541-3263, with 76 rooms. The nicer are the tatami rooms with futons rather than beds, starting at $150. A twin-bedded room for two begins at $185.
Luxury: At the famed 875-room Okura Hotel, scene of trade negotiations and economic summit meetings, there is, naturally, a fax machine in every room. Double rooms at the Okura these days run from $350 a night and up for a twin. (3582-0111, fax 3582-3707).
The Four Seasons Hotel Chinzanso, at 2-10-8 Sekiguchi in Bunkyo-ku, is in the midst of a spectacular Japanese garden. Doubles start at $320. (3943-7178, fax 3943-0294).
 
Where to Eat
 A raging argument in Tokyo is just how many restaurants there are -- some say 80,000, some say 120,000. No matter where the truth lies, this city has some of the best eating in Asia, and not just for Japanese food. There are scores of French restaurants, hundreds of Asian specialty restaurants -- the list is endless. The trick is finding them in a city with few street names; the best bet is to call ahead and have a map faxed to your hotel, something every restaurateur is accustomed to doing.
For a quick bite, on the cheap, head for the noodle shops. Some of the best are under the bullet train tracks at Yurakucho Station, near the Ginza, but every neighborhood has them, with plastic replicas of the offerings in windows or cases out front. At night, yakitori is the fare of the "salari-man" -- office workers out with their colleagues -- and a popular choice is Agatha's in Roppongi (3470-2234), near the Self-Defense Agency; set menus of 8 to 10 sticks of chicken, fish and grilled vegetables run about $30 a plate. (Add another $4 to $5 for beer.) Nearby, and in several other locations, is Nanban-tei (3402-0606 for the original outlet, a smoky bar), with menus in English and courses that start at about $25.
Great Cambodian food can be found in Ebisu at Phnom Penh (3461-2769), 1-10-14 Ebisu-Nishi; count on $35 to $45 a person and order the egg plant with chili sauce and the miniature spring rolls. Not far away is Khumbila (3440-2638), the city's best Nepalese restaurant at 5-22-3 Hiroo, with similar prices. A few blocks away, just by the exit of Hiroo Station, is an exceptional Thai restaurant, Gold Leaf (3448-1521), but it can be pricey, with dinners from $80 a person and up.
Kaiseki dinners, an assortment of spectacularly presented small dishes, mostly vegetables and fish, are usually reserved for the most exclusive and expensive restaurants, places where you can't get a reservation unless you are a politician or executive with the right connections. But one bargain place to sample it, in high-tech elegance, is Sai-Sai (3441-9006), near Hiroo station, where exquisitely presented dinner sets start at about $50 a person. Shirogane (3449-0033), with its spectacular bamboo dining room, has a fine selection of sashimi, tempura and Japanese beef. Dinners run from $80 to $150 a person, but lunches start at about $35. One of the area's best traditional Japanese garden restaurants is 10 minutes from Takao Station. Ukai Toriyama (0426-61-0739) is a series of marvelous tea houses and country-style rooms where kaiseki meals cost $80 a person and up.
 
Shopping
 Some of the best shopping in the city is for "mingei," or traditional crafts, everything from $25 handmade tea cups to $100 cherry wood boxes, that convey some of Japan's design esthetic in the smallest and most practical things. Bingoya (3202-8778), Tokyo's best shop for crafts from across the country, is four floors of pottery, wonderful paper products, fabrics, wood carvings and whimsical toys, some for as little as $10. Call for a map, or take bus 76 or 74 from the west exit of Shinjuku Station to the 8th stop, Kawada-cho.
Bargain hunters should head to the stores surrounding the Tsukiji Fish Market (take the Hibiya line subway to Tsukiji) for an incredible array of Japanese cooking goods, hand-made knives, from $100 handmade knives to $20 or $30 bamboo steamers, and a wide selection of pottery. This is where Tokyo restaurateurs shop. The alleys around the fish market are teeming with small shops, but there are also bigger pottery outlets along Harumi Dori, leading to the expensive Ginza shopping area. The closer you get to Ginza, the more expensive the goods become. Shop early; the stores close when the fish market does in midafternoon.
Mitsukoshi's main store, in Nihombashi (3421-3311, closed Mondays), right on top of the subway stop of the same name, has traditionally designed goods, kimonos and unusual kitchenware.
Other areas good for shopping and strolling are the souvenir markets around the Asakusa temple, the doll stores around nearby Asakakusa-bashi, (dolls run from $50 and up), and my favorite, the print and book shops in Kanda, surrounding the Jimbocho subway stop. This is the best place to look for ukiyoe, the traditional woodblock prints of scenes in Japan in the 19th century Omote-Sando, the classiest shopping district in the city, is the place for boutiques and designer goods.

HEADLINE: Looking to Foreclosures for Bargains

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

 BODY:
THE still-depressed residential real estate market is full of good buys these days. Take, for example, the four-bedroom Cape Cod that Sandra Nieves bought in Patchogue, L.I., last month. She paid $94,000 for a two-story stucco starter home on a half-acre lot. That's almost 30 percent less that the home's bank-appraised value of $130,000.
"After we fix it up, it will be worth about $150,000," she said.
Ms. Nieves's home was sold below its market value because it was in foreclosure. That means that the previous owner didn't keep up with the payments, and the holder of the delinquent mortgage had taken possession of the property and was selling it to pay off the loan balance.
A decade ago, homes in foreclosure were few and far between. They also carried a stigma of failure and misfortune that, regardless of how low the sale price, often repelled home buyers who weren't speculators or professional real estate investors.
Nowadays, though, home buyers, mirroring a trend found among consumers in other sectors of the economy, are becoming more value conscious. They are often seeking out and even limiting their searches to foreclosures or homes in pre-foreclosure -- when an owner has fallen behind in mortgage payments and is looking to sell a house to recover equity or avert further damage to the owner's credit rating.
Most buyers who wind up buying a home in foreclosure have actively sought out a financially distressed property. In many cases, all they did was ask local real estate brokers to show them only foreclosures, estate sales or homes being sold because of death or divorce.
In some cases, though, buyers have found foreclosure properties by going directly to local banks, which often have large inventories of foreclosed homes, or to the Resolution Trust Corporation, the Federal agency that acts as repository for assets held by failed banks and savings and loan institutions.
Properties that are about to be auctioned at foreclosure sales can also be found by scouring court records, legal notices in newspapers, the real estate classifieds or specialty publications, like Foreclosure Update, a weekly newsletter that prints lists of foreclosed properties in New York's five boroughs. (The newsletter, which can be subscribed to by calling 212-982-4026, costs $260 a year, $160 for six months or $89 for 12 weeks.)
"The hottest bargains now are in foreclosures," said Melissa S. Kollen of Commack, L.I., the owner of Long Island Real Estate Training, a real estate school, and the author of "Buying Real Estate Foreclosures" (McGraw-Hill, 1992). "The only better way to get a home is to inherit it.'
The foreclosure market isn't limited to starter homes, or low-priced houses or less-than-desirable properties, either. Last June, for instance, Ann and Larry Kaplan bought a four-bedroom contemporary home on two acres in the Cos Cob section of Greenwich, Conn., for $515,000. After putting in a $40,000 septic system, installing a water-softening system and repainting the house they now believe it is worth $750,000 to $800,000.
"This house was such a fantastic deal," said Ms. Kaplan.
Not all foreclosure sales offer such significant savings. In fact, most properties are sold for at least 90 percent of their current market value. Buyers, however, might also get a slight reduction in the interest rate on their mortgage or on the amount needed for a down payment, as banks are often eager to unload foreclosed properties.
"It is a popular way to get a little bit of an edge in price and maybe in financing," Theodore J. Doll, the president of Washington Savings Bank in Hoboken, N.J., said.
Those slight savings might not cover the cost of necessary repairs, though. Maintenance on many homes in foreclosure is usually minimal; many have been boarded up for months.
"We saw foreclosures that were so bad that you wanted to tear them down," said Ms. Nieves, who had new carpeting installed in her home after she closed on the sale.
BESIDES the additional costs, buying a home in foreclosure is a complicated procedure and the rules often vary from state to state. "There is a lot of homework and legwork that has to be done," Ms. Kollen said.
Danielle Weitz, who with her husband, Robert, bought a three-bedroom ranch in Franklin Lakes, N.J., last year that had been in foreclosure, strongly recommended hiring a lawyer to help in the process. "Without an attorney at the sale, you could wind up having more liens against the house than you know about," she said. "You have to do an iron-clad title search."
Ms. Weitz paid $160,000 for her home. She also paid $65,000 to pay off a second lien that had been levied against her home and an $8,000 tax lien. The total amount she paid, $233,000, is still below the $299,000 that the former owners had sought. She had even offered the owner $270,000 before the home fell into foreclosure.
The most daunting aspect of Ms. Weitz's purchase, however, was that a 10 percent down payment was required immediately, with the balance due within 10 days. Getting financing on such a time frame is, to say the least, difficult for most home buyers. It was accomplished only because she and her husband, Robert, had recently sold their home but had not yet moved out.
"The timing was phenomenal," she said.
There was also a second bidder on the house the Weitzes bought, indicative of the increased interest in buying foreclosures. "If there had been no other bidder, we would have paid $123,000 or $125,000, and usually there are no other bidders," she said. "But one other person took us up to $160,000."
Ms. Nieves also noted the increased competition. "We had made a bid on a house in Bay Shore that was in foreclosure, but someone outbid us," she said.
Ms. Nieves, who is 25 years old, lives in West Babylon, L.I., but will move into her new home on Jan. 1 with her 18-month-old son, Joseph Anderson, and her fiance, Martin Anderson, a 27-year-old general contractor.
"There are foreclosures all over the place," she said.
In the Northeast, in particular, foreclosures have increased phenomenally in recent years, according to statistics compiled by the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, a trade organization in Washington.
In New Jersey, for example, the percentage of mortgages in foreclosure has tripled in the last five years to the highest rate in the nation: 2.42 percent, or one in every 41. In Connecticut, the foreclosure rate has gone up almost eightfold since 1988, to 1.75 percent. In New York, the figure has quadrupled over the same period, to 1.55 percent.
THE high current rate in New Jersey is attributable largely to the length of time it takes in that state to complete the process -- up to two years. By comparison, foreclosures can often be accomplished in less than six months in Connecticut.
Nationally, mortgages that have fallen into foreclosure have increased by about 20 percent in the last three years, to 1.02 percent, as of June 30, according to the Mortgage Bankers of America, which surveys about 40 percent of the mortgages in the nation.
"I don't see any reason why foreclosures in the New York area would go down as long as the economy remains the way it is," said David Breger, a lawyer and vice president of Real Property Publications, the publisher of Foreclosure Update. "The market for foreclosures is as active as it ever was. My bet is that it will stay the same in '94."
Subscriptions to Foreclosure Update cost $260 for a year, $160 for six months or $89 for 12 weeks.
Many of the foreclosures in the Northeast are a direct result of the hundreds of thousands of job losses in the region since 1987, which have helped depress local property values and home equity levels. In some cases, exasperated home owners walk away from a property when their mortgage is larger than the value of the home.
Foreclosures, though, may also be a result of divorces or deaths that have left a spouse unable or unwilling to keep up with mortgage payments.
As an example of the different circumstances that can lead to a foreclosure, the home Ms. Nieves bought in Patchogue was formerly owned by a house painter who went out of business; the home Ms. Weitz bought in Franklin Lakes was previously owned by a dentist involved in a costly divorce, and the home bought by Mrs. Kaplan in Greenwich had been owned by a real estate developer who had pledged his home as collateral for a failed real estate project.
"We had been looking for three years, and we wanted to live in Greenwich," said Ms. Kaplan, 41, an executive recruiter, who along with her husband, Lawrence, 51, an accountant, used to live in nearby Darien. The couple have a 6-year-old daughter, Jacqueline.
"We were looking for estate sales, divorces or foreclosures," she added. "We lost a house we wanted that was involved in a divorce. We were outbid."
Though there is an abundance of foreclosures in the Northeast today, there are also recent signs that, as the real estate market and the economy improve, the number may have peaked.
"Our foreclosures have declined," said Mr. Doll, whose bank had 21 loans in foreclosure in October compared with about 50 at the same time last year. "We still have a few that were in process back in 1991, but there are less than there had been."
Lawrence G. Esmonde, a spokesman for the Resolution Trust Corporation, also said that his inventory was shrinking. "The numbers are certainly lower than they were a year ago," he said.
Nationally, the R.T.C. took over about 114,000 commercial and residential properties in 1989; it has about 16,000 left. There are currently 128 R.T.C. residential properties for sale in New York and 83 in New Jersey. No figures are available for Connecticut.
"We not getting any new assets and were are getting rid of what we have pretty quickly," Mr. Esmonde said.
The inventory of foreclosed properties is still high, however. Terance P. Beaty, director of special services for William Pitt Real Estate in Stamford, Conn., said that 5 percent -- or 207 -- of his company's real estate sales in Fairfield and Litchfield Counties in the last year had been foreclosures. A decade ago, that figure would have been about 0.5 percent.
"The Northeast has never seen this level of foreclosures," he said. "The 80's really killed a lot of people. We have about 320 in inventory, and we're getting about 30 more a month, and closing on about 10 of them each month."
He said that many of the foreclosed homes were starter homes boughtby first-time buyers, adding that foreclosures frequently resulted not only from job losses but also because of no-income documentation or no-down-payment loans that were common in the 80's.
"There were a lot of loans made to people who should have never received loans," he said.
Mr. Beaty added that he did no see the level of foreclosures declining until late next year. "And you won't see any appreciation in the rest of the market until the foreclosures get cleared away," he said. "People won't be able to get market prices because the foreclosures pull down the overall market."
The downward drag on all home prices because of the foreclosure market is exacerbated by the growing number of people who are learning about and looking for foreclosures. Ms. Nieves, Ms. Kaplan and Ms. Weitz, for example, all shopped specifically for below-market-price properties and were introduced to them by bankers or brokers.
Ms. Kollen, the author of the book on foreclosures, said that a common question buyers asked about the foreclosure market was 'Where are the homes found?' "
For pre-foreclosures, she suggested scanning the real estate sale ads looking for key phrases like "owner desperate" or "motivated" or "anxious to sell." There are also lists of homes, called lis pendens, that have legal actions pending against them.
"CONTACT the owner through a letter or a personal appearance," Ms. Kollen said. "You may have to do it five or six times because a lot of these people are in denial. They can't sell their home and they can't keep the debt. Tell them you are going to pay off their debt. The benefit to them is that they will have no deficiency judgment."
"It is really better to work something like this out without having the house taken back or foreclosed," she said. "And banks are working with delinquent owners as never before. The banks will sometimes accept the deed as payment in full, or consider a buyer who wants to assume the mortgage."
Should this tactic fail, Ms. Kollen suggested getting in touch with the bank that holds the mortgage and offering to pay off the debt and assume the mortgage. The bank then may increase the pressure on the delinquent owners.
The best way to find homes that have already fallen into foreclosure is to check the legal ads of newspapers for auctions or ask a local bank or broker about homes that are in foreclosure. Ms. Nieves, Ms. Kaplan and Ms. Weitz all found their homes with the aid of a broker or banker.
Foreclosure policies vary widely among banks and states, but usually the process does not begin until a borrower is at least 90 days behind on mortgage payments. Once the foreclosure process is begun it may take several months before a judgment is reached in court. With a judgment issued, it may take several more months before the home can be seized or sold.
In most states, the property is usually sold at an auction -- either in the courthouse or at the property site. In most cases, the bank or mortgage holder is the only bidder; in essence, it is buying back the property for a nominal processing fee. The mortgage holder will then resell the property, either through a private auction or through brokers, to recoup the money it is owed. If the mortgage holder does not recover all the money, it may still pursue the original owner for the balance, unless the owner has filed for bankruptcy or, in rare cases, has a nonrecourse loan.
Only about one in seven loans that go into foreclosure results in judgments, however. And of those, only about one in seven results in evictions. Most borrowers who are subject to foreclosure sell their homes, especially if they have equity in the properties. If they cannot sell, a not uncommon problem these days, or if they have little or no equity, they often seek revised payment schedules or get stays through legal motions or bankruptcy protection.
But once a property has reached foreclosure, the lender, which is responsible for taxes and maintenance of the property until a new buyer takes over, is often eager to make a deal.
As Mr. Doll, the savings bank president, said: "We are not in the business of owning properties."

HEADLINE: The Struggle to Find Buyers for Studios

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In my co-op apartment house anyway, the reason that studios for sale aren't moving ["Studio Owners Struggle to Find Buyers," Nov. 21] is their relatively high maintenance charges. These are drawbacks in selling the larger apartments as well. Part of the problem lies with the board's seeming unconcern with trying to economize on operating costs, and spending unnecessarily large sums on cosmetic renovations. 
 Rarely if ever has a studio shareholder-occupant been elected to the board, which might provide representation for this constituency. One reason is that studios do not command as many voting shares as the larger apartments.
I suggest that a co-op's studio shareholder-occupants organize to gain some seats on the board and issue a periodic newsletter voicing their views and concerns about building conditions. Much can be done to make board members and management accountable to all the shareholders, but not many tenants make the effort.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property/The Shifting Nature of 14th St.;
The Hub of Change Is Union Square

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
THINGS are hopping around Union Square these days. Bradlees, the big regional discounter, has leased the former Mays department store building, which has stood empty on 14th Street between Broadway and University Place since the spring of 1991.
Toys 'R' Us is going into three floors at 32 Union Square East, near 16th Street, where Kiddie City used to be. House of Blues, a jazz club, will soon open at 20 Union Square East, the old American Savings Bank building on 15th Street. 
 Coffee Shop, that chi-chi restaurant at 30 East 16th Street, is turning its back room into a restaurant-cum-private-party space. The Union Square Cafe has done so well at 21 East 16th Street that Danny Meyer, its owner, will soon open another restaurant, Gramercy Tavern, a few blocks north, at 42 East 20th Street.
The reason seems obvious. "This is a transportation hub, and that makes it a great retail hub," said Benjamin Fox, a partner at New Spectrum Realty.
Try telling that to the merchants strung along 14th Street between Third and First Avenues. The soft economy and the botched road construction project that had 14th Street torn apart for 30 months have combined to keep their spirits -- and their revenues -- as downtrodden as the grafitti-laden blocks on which they struggle to survive.
"You used to need reservations to get in here, we were so busy," said Daphne Mahoney, who owns Daphne's Hibiscus, a Caribbean restaurant at 243 East 14th Street. "Now I'm not sure I can hold on for even three more months."
Welcome to the 14th Street/Union Square Business Improvement District, an area stretching from 14th Street to 17th Street around Union Square Park, and along 14th Street from First Avenue to Avenue of the Americas. Once uniform in its blight, it now has a personality that is split three ways.
Union Square itself is thriving. West 14th Street is caught in a time warp in which local stores try to push the cheap merchandise of yesteryear to shoppers who want higher quality, albeit discounted, goods. And East 14th Street is ailing badly.
"We can help with security and with cosmetic things, but only new stores can get traffic to these streets," said Robert W. Walsh, the district's executive director.
It is quite a comedown from a decade or so ago, when the whole district was a mecca for working-class shoppers. Some worked in the area's clothing-production lofts, others flocked in from New Jersey, the other boroughs and other parts of Manhattan. After all, subways, buses, and PATH trains converge on Union Square, and the local merchants offered bargains that were hard to find elsewhere.
Since then, most of the lofts have closed, taking away much of the local shopping base. And discounters began opening stores in the suburbs and in the city outside Manhattan, enabling the commuters to buy their bargain wares closer to home. The seemingly endless reconstruction of 14th Street, with its concommitant traffic gridlock, kept away the final diehards. Now the street has reopened, but the shoppers have not come back.
"It's facile to blame everything on the reconstruction, but there's just no reason for people to travel here to shop anymore," said Robert B. Pauls, a real estate consultant.
STILL, there's little gloom in Union Square itself. Children, not drug dealers, now populate the spruced-up park. Its well-visited Greenmarket has added a fourth day to its schedule. And the Coffee Shop will open an in-park cafe this spring.
"The redevelopment of the park and the area has led to significant absorption of retail and office space," said Bruce Weissberg, president of RELocate, a company that tracks commercial leases and sales.
Union Square's savior was probably Zeckendorf Towers, the residential condominium with office and retail space at its base that was completed in 1987 between 14th and 15th Street, the site of the old S. Klein on the Square. Integrated Resources, a financial firm, took its 365,000 square feet of office space, and upper-middle-income buyers took its 671 condominium apartments. Restaurants that catered to this crowd thrived.
"Before Zeckendorf Towers came in, distribution centers and raucous clubs were about all we could rent to around here," said C. Bradley Mendelson, a senior managing director at Edward S. Gordon Company who manages 860 Broadway, on the northeast corner of Union Square. He now rents to Hermann's, the sporting-goods store.
The Towers has not had smooth sailing, though. Integrated Resources went bankrupt, leaving the building's office space empty. But Macmillan/McGraw-Hill School Publishing has taken about 140,000 square feet, and Beth Israel Hospital is planning to take an additional 100,000 square feet.
The 16th Street restaurants continue to thrive, and have been joined by Texas, Steak Frites and other upscale newcomers. That influx has, in turn, lured many more office and retail tenants to the area.
"It is an exciting, trendy place, yet one where you can still get decent rents," said Robert A. B. Baraf, a managing director of Edward S. Gordon.
Many local landlords have indeed brought their rents down to fill their spaces up. Earle S. Altman, one of the owners of 915 Broadway, at 21st Street, has leased 13,000 square feet of ground floor space to Metronome, a restaurant with dancing, at a rent that is about 10 percent less than what Cafe Society, the last tenant, had paid.
"Everyone is more realistic these days," he said.
But walk either west or east on 14th Street, and the high spirits, as well as the attitude of realistic compromise, dissipate rapidly.
MR. WALSH'S group has tried to make the area more palatable. It has arranged for better street cleaning. And it runs a security office in a storefront at 223 East 14th Street -- between two former crack houses -- that dispatches guards who patrol the area, chasing off three-card monte dealers and bands of roving youths.
But still, street traffic -- and thus, potential shoppers -- remains sparse.
Mr. Walsh blames the city. He believes that, if only he could get zoning changes that would allow tall, mixed-use buildings on the corners of Third Avenue and 14th Street, he could attract developers who would bring big retailers in. He says that city planners have been stonewalling him on the issue.
The planners say that's ridiculous. "Zoning isn't the problem, the market and the economy is the problem," said Robert E. Flahive, director of the Manhattan office of the Department of City Planning.
East 14th Street isn't entirely stagnant. Housing Enterprise for the Less Privileged, a nonprofit group known as HELP that develops housing for homeless people, is building housing on a city-owned lot between Third and Fourth Avenue. The city itself is building about 30,000 square feet of retail space on the lot.
And the heady activity around Union Square could still set off a ripple effect up and down 14th Street. Indeed, if more discounters line up along the street, it could provide the missing part of a jigsaw puzzle that, when completed, will depict the largest continuous discount center in the city.
Already, Broadway around 18th Street sports ABC Carpet, Paragon Sporting Goods and other well-established stores. Lower Sixth Avenue has Bed Bath & Beyond and will soon have a Barnes & Noble megastore. There are rumors that Filene's Basement and Sports Authority are looking for sites in the area.
Vincent A. Carrega, an executive vice president at James Felt/Grubb & Ellis, a sales brokerage firm, said that several developers were looking at a 28,000 square foot lot on 14th and Broadway, empty but for a vacant eight-story loft building.
"The lot is in play," said Mr. Carrega, who expects a deal for a mixed commercial/ residential project within a year.
If all of the rumored deals go through, it could do wonders for the local economy, if not for the existing stores.
"You'll see fewer entrepreneurial operators and a lot more big chains," Mr. Pauls predicted. "What you'll wind up with is upgraded merchandise and upgraded stores."

HEADLINE: In the Region/Connecticut;
Hartford Indoor-Outdoor Amphitheater Put on Hold

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
AN ambitious proposal announced late in October for an indoor-outdoor amphitheater in Hartford's North Meadows, possibly the first such structure in the country, has been put on hold until mid-January while General Assembly leaders scrutinize its merits.
The 60,000-square-foot theater and semi-circular outdoor seating area will cost $22 million and accommodate 7,500 patrons indoors in winter and 22,500 more outdoors in summer. The project, which would be built on vacant land off Exit 33 of Interstate 91, adjacent to Conrail's freight yard, will also include parking space for 10,000 cars. 
 City and state officials support the project as a catalyst to jolt Hartford out of its economic doldrums. But a provision in the state's 1992 Tax Increment Financing Statute mandating a 30-day cooling-off period before the approval of state bond issues to finance construction was invoked earlier this month by State Senator Adela M. Eads, a Kent Republican, and Representative Richard O. Beldon, a Shelton Republican, who are among the 12 General Assembly leaders empowered to call for the delay.
"This is the first time that tax-increment financing has been used," said Bruce Carlson, policy development director for the state's Office of Policy and Management. "We are feeling our way."
The statute permits the use of revenues from a completed project to pay off the debt service on state bonds issued to finance the project. In this case, revenues from a 10 percent tax on tickets, and 6 percent sales tax on anything bought at the amphitheater, to be called the Connecticut Center for the Performing Arts, would go directly for debt service rather than into the general fund.
Before the 30-day stay was announced the Connecticut Development Authority was scheduled to vote on approving an $11 million tax-increment bond issue for the theater. When the stay expires it may choose to reschedule the vote, presumably with input from the legislators who asked for the delay.
The remaining funds would come from an $8 million mortgage bond issued by the Connecticut Development Authority and $3 million from the developers, a partnership of the Nederlander Organization of Chicago, which has eight outdoor theaters, and Metropolitan Entertainment of Montclair, N.J., a promoter of rock shows.
The developers hope to open the amphitheater next July without using any taxpayers' money. But, says Mr. Carlson, "in a worst case scenario the taxpayers would be responsible."
"Once the Connecticut Development Authority and the State Bonding Commission approve issuance of the bonds," he said, "they are simultaneously requiring the State Treasurer to pay the debt service out of state tax revenues. If the amount of revenue from the project is inadequate, there would be a draw on general tax revenues."
Some protection lies in the developers' commitment to reimburse the state for any amount it might have to pay. "We believe that the Nederlander Organization can meet that commitment," said Mr. Carlson. "Marketing studies show that an amphitheater in this area would be a great success, so that failure would most likely be the fault of the managers."
PROTECTION against default would be written into the state's contract with the developers, authorizing the state to assume ownership and operation of the theater.
James Koplik, president of Metropolitan Entertainment, estimated that operating costs would be around $10 million a year and that the theater would hire up to 750 part- and full-time employees.
"We expect to book a wide variety of performers -- Michael Bolton, B.B. King, Bonnie Raitt, Elton John, perhaps the Hartford Symphony Orchestra," he said.
In winter, the theater would be enclosed and heated by equipment installed in the roof. In summer, the side walls of the seating area would be removed and outdoor patrons would sit on a grassy, semi-circular hill, graded up to 75 feet high to provide unobstructed views of the stage. The theater was designed by Jeter, Cook & Jepson, Hartford architects.
Currently, 18 acres of the site is owned by the Hartford Redevelopment Agency, and 7 1/2 acres belongs to Conrail. Conrail will sell its parcel outright, but Collin Bennett, chairman of the Redevelopment Agency, said that "because land values are depressed, we are only leasing to the developer."
During 15 years of ownership the agency has been unable to attract a buyer to the site. But that has not prevented the agency's neighboring parcels from being developed. Several automobile dealerships, a B.J.'s Price Club, Bowlmaster Lanes, a jai alai fronton, a MacDonald's franchise, the Country Inn, a new post office and a retail-office complex called Commerce Park line both sides of the Reverend Moody Overpass.
The Overpass, a four-lane road three-quarters of a mile long, was built in 1983 to connect the North Meadows commercial district with downtown Hartford. It would give the theater a second entrance in addition to one planned on Jennings Road off I-91.
The developers say that noise from the adjacent railroad yard would be effectively muted by fences and landscaping, but Robert Krafty, property manager for Conrail's real estate, is skeptical.
"THE nearest track is about 30 feet from the amphitheater's property line," he said, "and we have warned these people that we operate 24 hours a day. This is an active switching yard, with moving freight cars screeching and banging into one another day and night. Our schedule is driven by our customers, whether there is a concert going on next door or not."
He added that regardless of sound barriers, "the developers must erect fencing around the entire perimeter of the site to prevent people from entering railroad areas that could be dangerous." The Amtrak passenger line is 100 yards from the theater property.
One problem the developers do not have is competition. The 16,000-seat Hartford Civic Center books sports events far more than concerts, and in summer performers prefer the huge audiences that can be accomodated in outdoor venues. The closest counterpart to the amphitheater is Great Woods, an open-air summer theater in Mansfield, Mass., 1 hour and 20 minutes away.
"We are expanding from 15,000 to 20,000 seats," said Kathy Rochefort, spokeswoman for Great Woods. "Hartford is too far to be competition. Our audiences come from the Boston and Worcester areas."
"Unquestionably this would help Hartford," said Joseph Cohen, spokesman for the Connecticut Department of Economic Development. "Even if a small percentage of 30,000 people bought tickets, stayed overnight, shopped, and ate in restaurants, it would be worth it. But right now it's still a proposal with major financial hurdles to overcome. We have yet to determine whether to move forward."

HEADLINE: Why Spending More on Child Care Reduces Violent Crime

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your report on the increase of crimes by very young children in New York City public schools (news article, Dec. 4) coincided with my receiving the Department of Labor's third-quarter report on women in the labor force. The first sentences summarized the findings: 
 "By far the most important labor market development between 1965 and 1992 has been the dramatic increase of working women. This has been punctuated by particularly steep increases in labor force participation among women in the central age groups (25 to 54), including those in the childbearing and childrearing years."
To me, the connection seems very evident. Who is there to guide and teach our children in their early years? Do we really believe that violence on television is the culprit? What values are we passing on to the next generation when there is no one there to help children assess what they are seeing, to set patterns of behavior that condemn violence, to teach, guide and mold thought?
This is not to suggest mothers shouldn't work. Many families, particularly single-parent families without a father present, must have the incomes of working mothers to survive. Our country's economy and strength depend on full participation of our 53 percent female population. Nor does the marketplace adjust easily to family needs. Yet the human infant does not enter the world capable of surviving or developing into a well-organized member of society without adult care and supervision.
Every other industrialized country recognizes that it is counterproductive not to provide organized care for children. In our country, we have not even been able to offer child care to move families off welfare and into the labor force. How long will it take us to know we must provide an organized system of high-quality child-care services, not based on income except in setting fees on a sliding scale, not segregated by income levels, but available to all who require it?
Congress will consider reauthorization of the Child Care and Development Block Grant in 1995. It is inadequate in the number of children served and the quality of care that can be purchased. Congress must use this opportunity to provide high-quality care to all families in need of assistance. This should be the first step on a long road to parity with the rest of the industrialized world.
Every neglected child is a potential danger to society. How many innocent people will have to die, caught in gun battles, before we can recognize this?

HEADLINE: Look at What Rice for Japan Will Cost Us

 BODY:
To the Editor:
After years of pressuring Japan to open its markets to rice imports, United States negotiators finally won a battle for freer trade at the expense of truth in advertising (Business Day, Dec. 8). 
 How does one grow rice in California? Only with tremendous government subsidies! Rice is produced at the expense of billions of taxpayer dollars for water projects to redirect water from the Colorado and other rivers to central and Southern California. Such projects were (and are) not only economically disastrous but environmentally destructive as well.
The relatively small number of rice growers in California are among the most heavily subsidized agricultural producer groups ever.
While it may be good for United States producers to have Japan open its markets, the victory for California rice growers is a travesty for the doctrine of free trade. Rice would not grow in California if not for handouts by our Government on a truly monumental scale.

HEADLINE: Trick Question;
In Foreign Affairs, Clinton Faces Tests He Can't Study For

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THERE is an old saying that experience is what you get from not having it when you needed it, and Bill Clinton is about to get a lot of foreign policy experience as he confronts a Russia that no longer necessarily seems destined for democracy and free markets.
In his first year as President, Mr. Clinton has excelled in foreign policy when the emphasis has been on trade and economics. But the political uncertainty now looming in Russia, after a surge by nationalists and Communists in last week's election, is not easily navigated with spreadsheet diplomacy or lawyerly negotiations. 
 It is the sort of thing a President navigates with his gut instincts and political antennae. Global trade agreements are about managing the rational side of international affairs. Russia, Bosnia, Haiti, Somalia and North Korea are about managing the irrational side, and that is where Mr. Clinton is now going to be severely tested.
Girding himself for that test, the President moved last week to strengthen his national security team. Hoping to end months of sniping about his ineffectual and inarticulate foreign policy advisers, he dumped his Secretary of Defense, Les Aspin, whose absent-minded-professor demeanor and tendency to think out loud had lost him the military's confidence -- and Mr. Clinton's.
Unlike his bollixing up of earlier personnel matters, Mr. Clinton made sure that his ax was razor sharp and that it fell on Mr. Aspin with such a clean, swift blow that the Defense Secretary was handed his head with a minimum of blood and virtually no public criticism. The President replaced him with an Establishment figure, Bobby Ray Inman, a retired admiral who had served in senior intelligence jobs and distinguished himself as a manager and intellectual. The Congress applauded; the Pentagon sighed in relief. No muss, no fuss.
But Mr. Inman is a son of the cold war, indeed of its most shadowy aspects. What vision he brings to the defense job is unclear. He certainly is a safe choice. But Mr. Clinton has consistently been inclined toward "safe" Establishment figures in his foreign policy team. Partly this is because he does not want to spend time on these issues and feels comfortable turning them over to people who he thinks won't get him into trouble; partly it is because he desires the acceptance of the Establishment, and partly it is because he does not trust his own instincts in foreign affairs.
That is too bad, because his impulse to choose from this elite has not served him especially well so far (just as it did not serve his idol John F. Kennedy), and because he is moving into a phase of foreign policy that is all about politics and not about pinstripes. And more than once he has shown that he is better off following his own political instincts than doggedly heeding advice from "experts."
Remember when Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization were about to come to Washington and sign a peace accord? It was not clear whom they would send. All of Mr. Clinton's foreign policy advisers told the President that it would be a political disaster to invite Yasir Arafat. At the news conference at which Mr. Clinton announced that the signing would be in Washington, the talking points written for him in advance instructed him to signal that Mr. Arafat would not be there.
Sure enough, the first question asked was whether Mr. Arafat could come. Mr. Clinton, acting on his impulse that Mr. Arafat's presence was essential, answered: "Whoever they decide will be here is fine with us." His advisers were stunned, but later admitted he was right. However, such free-lancing on his part is the exception, not the rule, which may be unfortunate.
Like it or not, the President's political instincts are about to get a workout abroad. Before last week Mr. Clinton had plenty of reason to feel that his Russia policy was pretty much on target. He supported President Boris N. Yeltsin and produced $2.5 billion in economic aid, assuming this would keep Russia on a bumpy but upward trend toward reform. But the jagged-edged outcome of Russia's election has stunned the Administration, and is forcing it to rethink its whole approach. The big surprise was the 24-percent vote given to a party headed by Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, an ultra-nationalist who sounds every bit a fascist. Millions of Russians had cast ballots for a bizarre braggart who appealed to their sense of grievance and wounded pride.
What to do? Mr. Clinton must now walk two different tightropes, knowing that either can collapse at any time. On one side he has to redouble support for Mr. Yeltsin and the reformers, but without being so obvious, or imposing so many economic conditions, that it makes Mr. Yeltsin appear a stooge of the West and plays into the nationalists' hands.
On the other tightrope he has to begin to hedge America's bets against a Weimar Russia scenario, in which economic deprivation feeds radical Slavic nationalism, sweeping Mr. Yeltsin aside. And he must do his hedging without undermining Mr. Yeltsin. The only way to accomplish that may be by bringing into the Western security orbit, specifically NATO, those states in the former East Bloc that are already firmly democratic, like Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary, in order to consolidate the gains of the end of the cold war.
That doesn't mean excluding Russia, but it does mean forcing the Russians to realize they have a choice: Continue with reform and be embraced by the West, or follow Mr. Zhirinovsky and have the world aligned against them.
Until now, the Clinton team has been unwilling to take this step. It has wanted to split the difference, by hinting at NATO membership but not actually offering it. But that is only making the Russians nervous without reassuring the East Europeans.
Mr. Clinton's relationship with Russia throughout his first year in office was generally so positive -- with Mr. Yeltsin basically doing everything the United States wanted -- that it allowed the President to avoid these tough choices. "But what we have seen with the Russian elections," said the Presidential historian Michael Beschloss, "is something that we did not think was plausible only a week ago: that Zhirinovsky could be the next leader of Russia, or, at the very least, that his people are going to be a very important political force that can do a lot to tie Boris Yeltsin's hands."
Any Administration that does not build a dam to protect American interests against that would be irresponsible. "And that brings you to choices," said Mr. Beschloss. "Once you start talking about admitting nations to NATO you are making choices that bring you something, cost you something, and commit you in ways that speeches about 'enlargement of democracy' do not. This is one of the toughest problems that can face any President, but particularly a President who has not spent a lot of capital on this side of his job."
There is more at stake here than Mr. Clinton's foreign policy reputation. What is at stake is the whole American expectation, or maybe illusion, that after the Berlin wall came down the countries to the East were somehow destined to move toward free-market democracy. Though the road would be bumpy, Americans told themselves, the end was never in doubt. Well, the end is in doubt. History on the other side of the wall, it seems, is not over. It's more messy than ever.

Old Laws Have a Way Of Learning New Tricks

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THROUGH an evolutionary process that seems peculiar to broad-based laws that are enacted to combat one set of problems and end up being applied to a host of others, the Federal racketeering act now finds itself the weapon of choice in the struggle against violence at abortion clinics.
Fashioned in 1970 as a tool against the mob, the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act, or RICO, had already undergone several metamorphoses before it was pulled into the contentious abortion debate. It is now routinely cited in ordinary commercial disputes and in criminal cases far afield from organized crime. This month, the Supreme Court heard arguments in a case that will decide whether advocates of abortion rights can use the law against groups that have staged unruly demonstrations at abortion clinics. 
 While the transformation that RICO has undergone is hardly unique, its story offers a cautionary tale about the consequences, intended and otherwise, of writing broad criminal laws. Many other laws have taken on lives of their own, shaped over time, like the people who conceive them, by economic forces and by technological advances, by political currents and by social mores.
Decades ago, statutes were passed against conspiracy and mail fraud, and to safeguard civil rights and securities trading. It is impossible to know if those lawmakers could have imagined the unlikely uses to which these laws would be put by prosecutors and plaintiffs not yet born, uses far more complex and subtle than trying to put Al Capone in jail, force the University of Alabama to admit blacks or prevent Wall Street from peddling the worthless paper of phony companies.
Not everyone thinks this is for the best. Civil liberties and defense lawyers point to RICO as an example of how such open-ended laws can be misused by prosecutors who are overzealous and plaintiffs who are overly creative.
"RICO is the Achilles' heel of substantive criminal law," asserted Bruce A. Ackerman, a Sterling Professor of law and political science at Yale. "It hasn't grown as if it's had a life. It's more like a cancer."
But others say that RICO fits comfortably in the American tradition of changing laws to fit the perceived needs of justice. "The most exotic beasts get tamed over time," said Gerard E. Lynch, a professor of law at Columbia University and former head of the criminal division of the United States Attorney's office in Manhattan. "Over time, people get comfortable with patterns, and what was once considered innovative becomes routine."
Social legislation adopted during the New Deal era against excesses of corporate power are among the statutes that have been transformed. Once, they were used to combat monopolies and cartels; now they regulate how corporations behave.
The concentration of power in corporate America, once scorned by trust-busters as a monopolistic shackle on the marketplace, is now selectively encouraged by the regulators in areas like telecommunications and biotechnology as a way of competing against foreign giants, and in banking and health care as a way to cut costs.
 
Science Forces a Rethinking
 Advances in science and technology have forced a rethinking of criminal and civil laws in many areas. This year, the Justice Department said it plans to crack down on pornography in computer programs. Even though no Federal laws have been written with precisely that problem in mind, prosecutors say they intend to apply existing provisions in the criminal code as best they can.
Just as the courts have developed detailed precedents for the legal use of telephone wiretaps, prosecutors are looking at ways these rules can be applied to surreptitiously monitor personal computers and fax machines. In the area of intellectual property, courts are applying age-old principles of patents and copyrights to the alteration of genes.
Experts in the differences between American laws and those in other countries also point to unique qualities of American jurisprudence that allow laws to change their shape and character over time. Laws in the United States are more malleable than laws elsewhere because of the unusual role of American courts as the last refuge for safeguarding individual liberties and rights, the sanctuary when Congress or the White House is unable for one reason or another to resolve political questions. Other countries, which give their courts less leeway to reinterpret statutes or approve of new uses of old ones, tend to have bodies of inflexible law. "There is hardly a political question in the United States," Alexis de Tocqueville observed more than a century and a half ago, "which does not sooner or later turn into a judicial one." What this means, of course, is that old laws are often given new meanings.
Yet some laws have shelf lives. That lesson is also clear from the RICO case before the Supreme Court, which has become much more significant because the Justices have already barred the use of a civil rights act, passed 120 years ago, against violent protesters at abortion clinics. "There are certain natural life spans to laws," said Professor Lynch, "both in terms of the way in which they get adapted and in the way they get stodgy."

Alaskans Don't Want To Be Anyone's Siberia

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN

DATELINE: SEATTLE

 BODY:
THE remnants of Russian influence in Alaska, from the blue-domed churches found in Aleut native villages to the tiny dolls sold to cruise ship passengers in Sitka, are a big part of the state's modern tourist shtick.
But the 49th state is not exactly warming to the idea of taking this a step further. So it is saying no, thanks, to Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the right-wing extremist who stunned the world with his strong showing in elections in Russia on Sunday, and who in the past has suggested that Alaska be reclaimed by his country. 
 "You mean, he wants to welsh on the deal?" said John Manly, press secretary to Gov. Walter Hickel of Alaska.
In what at the time was considered Seward's Folly -- after President Andrew Johnson's Secretary of State, William H. Seward -- the United States purchased Alaska from Russia in 1867 for $7.2 million. Turned out to be a pretty good deal. Even accounting for inflation, the purchase price today would barely pay the bar tab of fishermen, oil workers and miners who now extract more than $10 billion worth of natural resources from Alaska every year.
At the time of the purchase, the Russians had claimed Alaska for 126 years, and established a fur-trading network, a series of churches and a colonial capital in Sitka. As of this year, the United States has controlled Alaska for 126 years, though it has been a state only since 1959.
 
Creative Geography
 Whether Mr. Zhirinovsky is serious about restoring Alaska to what was once imperial Russia remained unclear after his press conference last week. But his party emblem offers a clue; it includes a map of the czarist empire embracing everything from Finland to Alaska.
"I don't think any of us expect to be giving up Alaska any time soon," said President Clinton when asked about it last week. On the other hand, noted Tom Bodett, an Alaska humorist and motel chain spokesman, "For that fringe element up here attempting to secede, this may be the foreign country they're looking for."
Governor Hickel, who has made a career out of playing to secessionist sentiment, was a bit cagey in his reaction to Mr. Zhirinovsky. Asked on Friday what he thought about Russia reclaiming Alaska, Governor Hickel said, "We would like to take it back first." He was referring to Alaska's 550,000 residents, many of whom feel, like him, that the Federal Government controls the state and not them.
 
Grim and Bering It
 Russia's rule was a largely brutal experience for aboriginal Alaskans.
Vitus Bering, sent by Peter the Great to explore the North Pacific, saw Alaska in 1741 and claimed it for his country. Fur hats were a fashion rage in Europe at the time, and provided the economic incentive for Russia to begin clobbering thousands of sea otters, hunting them to near-extinction.
To further the trade, the Russians essentially enslaved the native Aleut people, taking them to the distant Pribilof Islands to club and skin otters. The first Russian settlement was on Kodiak Island in 1784, a largely treeless haven for the world's biggest bears. The capital of the territory was later moved south to Sitka, where it is much warmer year-round, though it is one of the wettest spots on Earth. Russia gave up its claim largely because it had trouble convincing settlers to move to Alaska and because the fur trade had collapsed. This was before oil became the lubricant of industrial progress.
Over time, the Russian Orthodox Church established a more benign presence in Alaska, converting many natives. Perhaps the strongest legacy of Russia's imperial presence is the blue-and-white churches that dominate tiny Aleut villages in coastal Alaska. In native hamlets like English Bay, virtually everyone in town has a Russian surname.
"From the native point of view, Russia did a couple of good things in addition to all the cruelty they inflicted," said Dr. Ted Mala, an Anchorage physician whose mother was born in Russia and whose father is Eskimo. What Alaskans and Russians share, said Mr. Mala, who pioneered cold-war exchanges between the two peoples, is a northern latitude and common attitude that comes from living far from the central government. As to whether any Alaskan would like to see Russian rule return, Mr. Mala just laughed.

HEADLINE: The World;
Regional Trade Makes Global Deals Go Round

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
ASSORTED presidents, prime ministers and political poo-bahs rushed to congratulate themselves last week on the initialing of the new General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which ended seven years of bargaining only hours before a self-imposed deadline. Alain Carignon, France's Minister of Communications, called it "a great and beautiful victory for Europe and for French culture." Striking a more statesmanlike pose, Peter Sutherland, GATT's Director General, celebrated the choice of "openness and cooperation instead of uncertainty and conflict."
But all that gush raises an awkward question: If global agreement is, in fact, the holy grail of trade liberalization, why have the last three American Presidents campaigned so fiercely for a separate regional trade agreement for North America, and why is Bill Clinton beating the drums for a separate pact linking the Asian economies to the Americas? 
 The answer in part is that regional deals often accomplish what GATT doesn't, and in part because they are a necessary catalyst to global agreement.
The Bush Administration dismissed the conflict between regionalism and globalism as more apparent than real, insisting that trade negotiators could walk on two (one regional, one global) legs. That is certainly the party line in the Clinton White House, too. However, not all economists -- make that political economists -- are so sure.
Most do agree that the classic complaint against regional free trade, namely that encouraging commerce within the region diverts trade from low-cost producers outside the region, no longer carries much weight. Worries that "customs unions" would divert more trade than they create stem from the 1950's, when Europe was dismantling internal barriers while maintaining high tariffs that discriminated against non-European imports. But "in today's world of low tariffs, I'd be surprised if there was much trade diversion," says Gary Saxonhouse of the University of Michigan.
Besides, Fred Bergsten, director of the Institute for International Economics, points out that the basic GATT accord already "makes the world safe for regionalism" by binding all 117 member-nations to a code limiting just how inward-looking they may be. Specifically, regional free trade deals cannot pass muster if they create new tariff barriers or raise existing ones against the rest of the world.
Why, then, the concern? Layering the grand global design for open trade with regional side deals could still have unintended consequences.
"When you walk on two legs," warns Jagdish Bhagwati, a trade specialist at Columbia University who has been a senior adviser to the GATT bureaucracy, "you sometimes end up on all fours."
In the best of circumstances, notes Robert Hormats of Goldman-Sachs International, regional accords can set the pace for global liberalization by setting precedents for the more awkward process of GATT-wide negotiation.
The United States' original free trade pact with Canada, for example, created a super-national mechanism for arbitrating disputes. And by no coincidence, argues Mr. Hormats, the World Trade Organization (the new, improved successor to the GATT that was created last week) will have considerably more authority to lay down the international law.
Regional pacts -- or the prospect of writing new ones -- can also be used to drive the parties back to the global bargaining table. In October, wise heads were all but reading the last rites for the GATT negotiations, as French politicians from both the left and right were tripping over each other to denounce limits on farm subsidies earlier agreed to by the European Community negotiators. Then Congress approved the North American Free Trade Agreement and sent President Clinton off in triumph to Seattle for a tete-a-tete on trade with his Asian counterparts.
Nothing happened at the Pacific summit meeting that directly threatened the mutually vital trade links between America and the European Community. And nothing is likely to happen anytime soon. A dozen formidable obstacles, everything from Japan's clubby business practices to China's lack of enthusiasm for free speech, block Nafta-style economic integration with Asia.
"But without the Seattle meeting," wonders Mr. Saxonhouse, "would Europe have been ready to compromise on GATT?"
 
Carry a Big Market
 That, however, is not the only way to read the tortuous route to compromise in Geneva. Mr. Saxonhouse also wonders whether the imperative to peddle Nafta to Congress like a patent medicine cure for lumbago did not distract -- and thereby weaken -- America's negotiators at the global talks. "Might we have gotten a better GATT agreement if Clinton hadn't spent so much time on Nafta?" he muses.
For his part, Mr. Bhagwati points to a problematic aspect of what is generally viewed as a virtuous global precedent in Nafta. To undercut opposition in Washington, long-xenophobic Mexico bowed to remarkably intrusive side agreements dictated by the United States, including a promise to clean up purely domestic pollution and one to raise the minimum wage. There are no parallels in the new global accord, but only because the United States had bigger fish to fry. And American environmental groups are vowing to raise the issue in any and every trade negotiation in the future, complicating the prospects for further trade liberalization.
Almost everyone agrees that regional negotiation is an effective tactic for expanding American influence on trade issues. Bilateral deals generally give America the bargaining edge because access to the American market is so much more important to smaller trading partners than access to their markets is to us. If, for example, Chile, Venezuela or Argentina is admitted to Nafta, it will be on terms decreed by Washington. And the more countries that sign on to American terms, the more likely they will serve as precedents for global agreements.
But Mr. Bhagwati fears that what America wants will not necessarily be what is best for the world economy -- or even, on balance, for Americans.
 
Momentum
 Certainly the Clinton Administration's willingness to "manage" trade by carving up international product markets by quota and its enthusiasm for playing the tough guy on anti-dumping disputes has made economists wonder whether Washington is a suitable role model for the young and impressionable.
Others -- probably the majority of trade analysts -- see more virtue than vice in the dual global-regional tracks.
"A lot of things fell off the GATT table" in those last frantic hours of negotiation in Geneva, reminds Mr. Bergsten. Among the subjects on which everyone agreed to disagree: financial services, telecommunications, French film quotas. "You have to keep the bicycle of liberalization moving forward," he insists, and only regional bargaining can preserve the momentum.

HEADLINE: The Nation;
The Regulatory Thickets Of Environmental Racism

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER

 BODY:
EVER since civil rights leaders marched in protest 11 years ago to prevent the construction of a new hazardous waste dump in predominantly black Warren County in North Carolina, private and Government studies have reported that minority communities not only suffer disproportionately from toxic contamination but also have been largely left out of the environmental cleanup of the last two decades.
As a political issue, what has come to be called "environmental racism" is almost irresistible to President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore. By addressing the problem, the Administration is appealing to three of the Democratic Party's most important constituencies -- minorities, the poor and environmentalists. 
 But as a matter of policy, developing new rules to keep minorities and the poor from bearing the brunt of modern industrial society may turn out to be as difficult and sensitive as anything the President has tackled. "Put the two together -- racism and pollution; it's a political hand grenade," said Kent Jeffreys, the director of environmental studies at the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a policy research group in Washington.
Over the last few months, the White House and several Federal agencies have been working on a new executive order that will, for the first time, direct Federal agencies to consider the racial and socio-economic characteristics of a community before they decide to build a new project or issue a new environmental rule.
Civil rights groups and environmental organizations say they support the Administration's work as a first step toward preventing hazardous waste plants and other undesirable industrial projects from being built in poor and powerless communities. Many leaders are calling for legislation that would give poor and minority communities much greater authority to bar the construction of projects they didn't want.
"The executive order is a good thing, but it's only a small step to respond to the crisis in our communities," said Pat Bryant, executive director of the Gulf Coast Tenants Organizations, an environmental group in New Orleans. "The most effective and permanent way to protect all communities, not just Beverly Hills and the East Side of Manhattan, but all communities, is with legislation. The President could do much more."
But business executives and state regulators say that, by itself, the Administration's executive order may turn out to be one of the most significant and potentially costly changes in environmental policy in years. They say it could add another time-consuming and complicated layer of review to the already lengthy and expensive process for gaining approval for new projects. Unless the White House is careful, they say, the very communities it is trying to protect could suffer from more impediments to investing in minority areas. In Noxubee County, Miss., the focus of an E.P.A. investigation on environmental racism, blacks are divided over whether to approve a hazardous waste dump.
"What the Administration may be contemplating seems to be at odds with their message of economic development," said Gary Stewart, a spokesman for the Amoco Corporation. "In putting the executive order forward, we believe they need to make it easier in this country to site new industrial facilities, not harder."
Mr. Bryant, a leader of what has come to be called the environmental justice movement, bristles at suggestions that an executive order would harm minority communities. "We bear a disproportionate cost in terms of health from plants in our communities, and for the most part we are not included in the jobs that are available," he said. "They have a nerve saying this order could hurt us."
According to Administration and Congressional officials, the proposed executive order will require Federal agencies to collect information about income, race and other socio-economic factors before approving new projects, such as ports or military installations. Federal agencies may also be required to more precisely estimate health risks if a Federal project is built in a minority community.
The officials, all of whom insisted on anonymity, said the Environmental Protection Agency may be directed to study whether state regulators discriminated by allowing polluting plants to be built more often in poor and minority communities and by not vigorously enforcing environmental rules.
"It looks to be a good step in the right direction," said Robert Wiygul, a lawyer in New Orleans with the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund who represents members of communities in Louisiana and Mississippi in two cases involving allegations of environmental discrimination. "This kind of thing hasn't been addressed in a systematic way in environmental decision-making before."
 
Guarding Public Health
 Carol M. Browner, the Administrator of the E.P.A., said that current statutes are inadequate. "The underlying issue is to protect the public's health," she said. "This means looking at all the tools available to us and creatively working to have problems in poor and minority communities addressed."
Some Federal officials, though, said they were nervous about the executive order. By adding a new layer of review for most Federal decisions affecting the environment, the President's order might work at cross purposes with his vow to "reinvent" Government by streamlining bureaucracy, they said.
State regulators are also skeptical. They said states already contend with thousands of Federal environmental directives and rules using small staffs working without enough money. The executive order, they said, could lead to an entirely new kind of review before permits could be issued for industrial projects. Along with the traditional environmental impact statements that look at the effects of a proposed plant on air, water, wildlife and human health, the President's order could require companies or states to prepare new sociological impact statements of unknown breadth and complexity.
"Much of this attention to environmental inequity was brought about by concern about waste plants moving into minority communities," said Charles Chisholm, director of the office of pollution control at the Mississippi Department of Environmental Quality. "But it won't stop there. It will play out with all kinds of permitting decisions. The good thing is that it will broaden the level of sensitivity we have to facility siting. The bad thing is it could make permitting decisions even slower than they are."

HEADLINE: Humbled by Mean Recession, California Fights for Its Jobs

SERIES: Reinventing California -- A periodic look at a changing state.

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 18

 BODY:
The days when California was so rich that it did not care whether businesses came or went are over. Just ask the people at Lego, the Danish toy maker, who were searching for a site for the company's first "family park" in the United States.
In April 1992, Gov. Pete Wilson phoned Lego's president in Denmark. Then the State Legislature relaxed the tax laws affecting foreign companies. Finally, state and local officials, utility executives and private developers formed a special "red team," taking its name from a term coined by the aerospace industry for groups assigned to emergency work. The state quickly promised $7.1 million in roads and marketing help. 
 The result: Last month, Lego announced it would build its 125-acre, $100 million park in what is now a field of cultivated flowers in Carlsbad, a coastal suburb north of San Diego. The city of 65,000 people beat out advocates for sites in Virginia and five other places.
"California never had a reputation for doing what it did," said Joseph L. Manna, director of new ventures for Lego Systems Inc., the Lego subsidiary in Connecticut that will oversee the project. "We expected a coordinated effort from Virginia. We were surprised that California's effort was equally impressive."
While Legoland's 700 jobs will not go far toward lifting California out of its prolonged slump, the episode speaks volumes about the changed attitude here toward business.
The Legislature recently concluded its 1993 session with an extraordinary degree of cooperation between the Republican Governor and the powerful Democratic Speaker of the Assembly, Willie L. Brown Jr. They revamped the state's fraud-ridden workers' compensation system, revised tax laws to encourage investment in manufacturing and took other steps meant to make California more competitive.
 
A State on the Mend
 "We've healed a lot of self-inflicted wounds," said Julie Meier Wright, secretary of the California Trade and Commerce Agency. "Things have really changed in California, both in attitude and substance."
After returning recently from a 17-day trip to Asia to sell California, Governor Wilson pronounced the state on the mend. "I would not have wanted to make that trip a year ago," he said in an interview last Monday. "I would have had a whole lot more to defend and a great deal less to sell."
It is difficult to tell if and when all these efforts will heal California's economy.
The changes will be helpful in the long run, said Don L. Gevirtz, chairman of the Foothill Group, a financial services company. "But we are in such a deep recession that it's going to take a year or two to make any significant difference," he said. "Our problem is overcapacity. We have too many buildings, plants, drug stores, lawyers, banks. The Governor and Legislature cannot change that."
This overcapacity is the result of decades of economic boom -- growth that came to be considered excessive, a problem that had to be controlled.
But the three-year recession, military cutbacks, natural disasters, the Los Angeles riots and the high cost of doing business have caused stunning job losses -- 585,000 since 1990, or 1 in every 20 jobs.
Part of this loss resulted from a substantial exodus from California of industries raided by other states. Over the last decade, according to the California Industry Migration Study, a survey paid for by five utilities, 1,035 companies moved all or part of their operations to other states or nations, for a loss of up to 224,000 jobs or job opportunities. More than half were valued high-technology jobs in computers, electronics and semiconductors.
But there are signs that a recovery may have begun. Since June, sales of single-family homes have been running ahead of last year, according to the California Association of Realtors. And the United States Department of Labor reports that the number of jobs in California rose by 40,000 in November, while unemployment dropped from 9.8 percent to 8.6 percent.
 
Aggressive Strategy To Resurrect Jobs
 Irrespective of a recovery, Larry J. Kimbell, director of the Business Forecasting Project at the University of California at Los Angeles sees a new reality taking hold. He predicts a job recovery starting in 1994 but argues that the state will have to struggle to keep up. "Pretending that old glory days will return, when economic growth could be taken for granted or even turned away, is unrealistic," he said.
That message has been taken to heart, particularly in Southern California.
In Orange County, for example, local leaders recently formed a consortium to help keep companies from moving away. Its chairman is H. Fred Mickelson, vice president of Southern California Edison's operations in Orange County, where the electric utility has lost many customers in recent years.
"Five years ago, we would not have cared if a company said it was moving away," Mr. Mickelson said. "Now, in every presentation, we want them to know we love them."
The consortium's biggest victory so far was keeping Loral Aeronutronic, a subsidiary of the Loral Corporation, based in Manhattan. The company, which makes missiles and other weapons, employs 1,300 people in Newport Beach. It wanted to get out of an expensive lease and was being wooed by Arizona, Georgia, Texas and other states.
Mr. Mickelson and a County Supervisor, Thomas Riley, met with Loral executives last year to determine what it would take to keep the company in Orange County. Unlike other states, California could not afford to offer free land or huge tax abatements.
But the consortium was not without leverage. Edison offered a lower rate for power. Mr. Riley promised to speed approval of permits if the company agreed to occupy a former Hughes Aircraft plant in Rancho Santa Margarita. The South Coast Air Quality Management District, the smog-control agency, agreed to expedite emissions permits. The consortium argued that a move to another state would cost Loral $50 million to transfer employees.
On Oct. 4, Loral announced it would stay.
The consortium is now engaged in similar negotiations with the Taco Bell Corporation, which has its headquarters, with 900 employees, in rented quarters in Irvine, Calif. It wants to build its own headquarters and has been courted by the Governors of Georgia, North Carolina and Texas, dangling various goodies.
The consortium met with the restaurant chain's executives on Dec. 13, in part to make the company feel wanted. "When you've got three states coming and the Governor of California has not visited them, do you feel loved?" Mr. Mickelson wondered.
Not all these efforts have paid off. Numerous small manufacturers have been leaving the area for reasons unrelated to the business climate. The Amflo Division of Bridge Products, which makes pneumatic couplers used in air compressors, will shut down its plant in Santa Ana next July and consolidate its operations with those of other plants in Oklahoma and Virginia: 70 jobs lost.
Amflo's general manager, Gary Spanos, said Santa Ana officials had made a "gallant effort" to keep them, offering cheap rent in the enterprise zone and other blandishments. But the larger benefits of consolidation outweighed them. "We don't need tax incentives," Mr. Spanos said. "That wasn't the issue. By consolidating you can service your customers better."
Other companies, particularly those needing a large labor force, are moving some operations to Mexico. William E. Lew, vice president of North American Production Sharing Inc., a San Diego company that helps locate manufacturing plants in Mexico, said: "California companies have to compete on a global basis. So for some companies that have labor-intensive assemblies, it makes sense not to be in California."
 
Fitting Small Parts In Economic Collage
 After seriously considering invitations to move to Arizona or Colorado, GT Bicycles of Huntington Beach recently chose to stay in California. The 14-year-old company, which manufactures and imports mountain bikes, employs about 400 people and has sales of more than $100 million a year.
"Though we have had many opportunities to move our manufacturing out of California, California is such an important market for us," said GT's co-founder and chief executive, Richard W. Long.
Mr. Long cited Southern California's proximity to Asia and Mexico and said the Mexican market had grown tremendously in recent years.
The main disadvantage is the high cost of living and doing business in California. But that has changed with recession. Home prices are down by as much as 30 percent, and GT has been able to negotiate favorable freight rates and reduced costs for cardboard and other supplies.
The clincher for the company was the designation of parts of Santa Ana as an enterprise zone. This month GT is moving its manufacturing and distribution operations into a vacant 150,000-square-foot building. It will avoid paying state taxes on manufacturing equipment installed there and will gain substantial tax credits for hiring through the state's Employment Development Department.
 
Shrinking Economy Redefines Priorities
 Until fairly recently, California was so flush that the Legislature felt free to create some of the richest public benefits and strictest environmental rules in the nation. Now those priorities are eroding as their costs become apparent in a contracting economy.
In recent months, the State Legislature has approved these changes:
*Narrower grounds for workers' compensation claims and a reduction in certain benefits, saving businesses $1.5 billion over three years.
*A 6 percent tax credit on the purchase of new manufacturing equipment, in effect reducing the sales tax on equipment by 75 percent.
*Modifications in the so-called unitary tax -- a levy against multinational companies, based on their worldwide earnings -- requiring less disclosure of foreign operations and giving hefty tax breaks to international companies that have substantial payroll and property in the state.
*Expanded tax credits for research and development.
*A streamlined process for obtaining environmental and other permits.
These changes have significantly reduced the cost of doing business in the state, said Richard C. Hall, manager of government affairs for the Intel Corporation, the leading maker of computer chips. Intel announced last month that it would expand its research operations in Folsom, Calif., adding 1,700 jobs, rather than move out of state. Hughes Aircraft also recently announced it would keep its headquarters in Los Angeles as a result of the tax changes.
The tax changes were a major factor in bringing Lego to Carlsbad. The company, known for its building-block toys, was at first chary about coming to California. For its part, the city feared a Disneyland-like amusement complex.
But the City Council, convinced that Legoland would be a sedate playland for small children -- and watching other parts of its economic base shrink -- adopted a new development strategy in March to accommodate Lego. About the same time, the city's red team began to meet.
In the months of deliberations, the Legislature voted to alter the unitary tax law, and Lego won a favorable ruling on its tax status. Ground-breaking for Legoland is set for 1997.
The project also has its opponents, who say it will bring transients and tawdry motels and restaurants and will spoil Carlsbad's village character. "It is going to change the character and economic direction of our community," said Geoffrey Bell, a dentist.
The City Council has set an advisory ballot measure to gauge voter sentiment next year.
If California's business climate has improved, it is still not widely recognized. In a survey released on Dec. 8, the California Business Roundtable found that both business leaders and average voters remained pessimistic about the economy. It found that most companies had no plans to expand in the state and that one in three voters worried about losing his job.
"People were very pessimistic about the economy," said Robert E. Wycoff, former president of Arco and now chairman of the roundtable. "But there is a new realism out there. They realize we are going to have to try a little harder than we did in the past."

HEADLINE: U.S. IS HARDENING ITS STAND ON IRAQ

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Dec. 18

 BODY:
Hardening its position toward Saddam Hussein's Government, the Clinton Administration wants to impose tough new requirements for lifting the United Nations ban on Iraqi oil exports.
The United States is urging other members of the United Nations Security Council to insist that Baghdad recognize Kuwait as an independent country and stop persecuting dissident Kurds and Shiite Muslims. 
 These conditions would be in addition to the Security Council's demands, made at the end of the Persian Gulf war, that Iraq disarm and let the United Nations monitor its military industries.
The American position, supported by Britain, France and Russia, three of the Council's other four permanent members, stems from mistrust of Mr. Hussein, officials said. It makes it less likely than seemed to be the case a few months ago that Iraq will start selling oil again soon. The position of China, the fifth permanent member, is not known.
 
Drop in Price of Oil
 Over the last year, the price of oil has dropped from about $18 to $19 a barrel to about $14.50. This was mainly because of weak demand but also because the market concluded that Iraq was trying to strike a deal with the Security Council that would allow it to sell oil again. The tougher United States policy on lifting the embargo could lead to a rise in prices.
Setting out the Administration's position in an interview on Friday, Madeleine K. Albright, the United States representative at the United Nations, called for "a two-phased approach" to lifting the ban on Iraqi oil sales.
First, she said, Rolf Ekeus, head of the United Nations commission overseeing Iraq's disarmament, must certify that Iraq has abandoned its nuclear, chemical and biological weapon programs as called for in Security Council Resolution 687.
The special commission must also show, she said, that it is able to monitor Iraqi industry to make sure Iraq does not try to make such weapons again.
 
'A Proven Track Record'
 "I've said we want a proven track record of 6 to 12 months' monitoring," Ms. Albright said.
But in addition, she said, Iraq's compliance with other Security Council resolutions must be taken into account in "any assessment of its readiness to rejoin society."
This means Mr. Hussein must give "clear evidence of respect for Kuwait's borders" and also "show respect for his own people" by ending his blockade of the Kurds in the north and his attacks against dissident Shiite Muslims in the south.
"There has to be an overall package here," she said.
The Administration's position recalls the stance taken by President George Bush and Prime Minister John Major of Britain, who both said they favored maintaining sanctions against Iraq as long as Mr. Hussein was in power.
 
Changes in Clinton's Attitude
 President Clinton's attitude toward the Iraqi leader has seemed somewhat ambivalent. At first he appeared to distance himself from Mr. Bush's hard line, saying in an interview before his inauguration that he was ready for a fresh start if the Iraqi leader changed his ways and cooperated with the United Nations. Saying he was not "obsessed" by Mr. Hussein, Mr. Clinton said he could imagine a normal relationship with him if he behaved according to international norms.
But in June, saying an investigation showed Iraq backed a plot to assassinate Mr. Bush on a visit to Kuwait, Mr. Clinton ordered a missile attack on an Iraqi intelligence headquarters in a suburb of Baghdad.
This summer, Mr. Ekeus got a green light from Washington, Paris and London before going to Baghdad to try to persuade Iraqi officials their best chance of getting the oil embargo lifted was by cooperating with the disarmament requirements imposed at the end of the Persian Gulf war.
This meant providing missing details of prohibited weapons programs and accepting long-term industrial monitoring.
 
Terms for Ending Sanctions
 Mr. Ekeus based his talks on a literal reading of Resolution 687, which says the ban on purchase of Iraqi oil by foreign countries "shall have no further force or effect" once the Council decides Iraq has complied fully with its disarmament demands.
Iraq would thus be free to resume oil exports, and reap billions of dollars in revenue, though the Security Council is expected to insist that a third of the money be used as compensation for victims of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
But United States officials now argue that the Security Council is effectively being asked to judge the likelihood that Mr. Hussein will continue respecting those provisions after the ban on oil sales is lifted.
And it is difficult to believe Mr. Hussein would continue to comply, they said, when he still says Kuwait is a province of Iraq and his forces continue to oppress dissident Kurds and Shiite Muslims.
"If the pattern of Iraq's behavior outside the demands of Paragraph 22 of Resolution 687 is still one of generalized noncompliance then it is difficult to believe Baghdad is sincere," an Administration official said.
After talks here in November, Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq said Baghdad was finally ready to accept the long-term monitoring and would also provide missing information about its weapon programs.
 
Will Iraq Stop Cooperating?
 It is possible that Baghdad, feeling it has been deceived by Mr. Ekeus, will now stop cooperating with his arms inspectors and that the commission's industrial monitoring plans will come to nothing.
Another possibility, analysts said, is that Iraq will make a new attempt to sell oil under another Security Council resolution.
Resolution 706 permits Iraq to sell $1.6 billion worth of oil to pay for imports of essential goods provided the United Nations closely monitors the distribution of these supplies.
Iraq opened talks with the United Nations this summer about selling oil under these terms but then abruptly broke them off.
Part of the reason appears to have been Mr. Ekeus's success in persuading the leadership they had a good chance of getting the oil embargo lifted completely by cooperating with his disarmament program.
But Iraqi officials have complained that Resolution 706 violates Iraq's sovereignty in unacceptable ways by putting the United Nations rather than Mr. Hussein in charge of distributing the goods Iraq buys and requiring that Kurds and Shiites get their fair share.
"It would turn Iraq into a United Nations refugee camp" a senior Iraqi official said recently.

Vice President Al Gore appealed to Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany today to put aside any doubts about Russia's political stability and to speed up aid to the country.
In a nearly two hour meeting at Mr. Kohl's home, Mr. Gore also raised the question of whether the International Monetary Fund should ease the inflation quotas put on Russia so the country can get aid faster to relieve its severe social and economic troubles. 
 Those issues were "a central topic of our conversation," Mr. Kohl said after the meeting near this heavily industrialized city in central Germany. The Chancellor said that "economic reform will only be successful" if Russia can "bring about a social situation that offers a clear and helpful perspective."
Mr. Gore's visit with Mr. Kohl was the last stop on his way home from a weeklong trip to Russia, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan, where he met with leaders and signed several accords to promote economic development and other ties to the United States. Mr. Kohl apparently had been waiting for a briefing from the Vice President before making any policy decisions in response to the unexpectedly strong showing in the Russian Parliamentary elections by the ultranationalist Liberal Democratic Party led by Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky.
 
Aid to Russia Reconsidered
 Mr. Zhirinovsky has emerged as the most visible opponent of President Boris N. Yeltsin's economic and political reforms. The resulting political confusion has put pressure on Mr. Kohl to reconsider the extent of Germany's aid. Many mainstream German politicians have expressed serious concerns about Mr. Zhirinovsky's showing, particularly because he has close connections to the German People's Union, a right-wing extremist party.
"We discussed some recent elections in Russia," Mr. Gore said after the meeting, "and we agreed to continue consulting each other."
Neither Mr. Gore nor Mr. Kohl discussed the specifics of their meeting, but Mr. Kohl echoed Mr. Gore's contention that the election results should only encourage both countries to reach out to Russia.
"The election results of last Sunday showed how important it is that all of us work together and pool our resources to support the forces of reform," the German Chancellor said.
Germany has contributed nearly $50 billion to Russia and other former Soviet republics since 1989, and has called on other countries to donate as well. But as the United States steps up its aid to the region, some American officials said Mr. Kohl has been more reluctant to continue the spending. German officials contend that Germany is suffering from a sour economy and has done its share already.
 
Doubts on a Broader NATO
 In an interview in a right-wing German newspaper this week. Mr. Zhirinovsky advocated that the Germans and the Russians unite in an "eternal alliance," and said he favored "close military cooperation with Germany," raising the memory of the bond forged by Hitler and Stalin in 1939.
Since the elections last week, Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel of Germany has sounded less sure that his country would still support an American proposal to increase cooperation between members of NATO and former members of the Warsaw Pact. The issue is expected to be discussed at a meeting of leaders of the Atlantic Alliance next month in Brussels.
In another effort to try to resolve lingering disputes over the nuclear arsenal of the former Soviet Union, Mr. Gore met with President Leonid M. Kravchuk of Ukraine in Budapest before arriving here. Ukraine has been reluctant to dismantle the nuclear missiles on its territory, and has not ratified the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.
"The United States is trying to play a constructive role in resolving this issue," Mr. Gore said, adding that "all sides will tell you progress is being made," though he was not more specific.
Strobe Talbott, the United States Ambassador at Large to the former Soviet Republics, met with Mr. Kravchuk earlier this week, but Mr. Gore would not discuss those talks.

HEADLINE: Farrakhan Urges Black Cleanup of Violence

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
After serving as the catalyst for a bitter debate in this year's mayoral contest, the Rev. Louis Farrakhan finally made his postponed public address yesterday, combining a message of black pride with a denunciation of what he called the corrupted moral tenor of the nation.
In a fiery speech, Mr. Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, told an audience of nearly 25,000 in the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center in Manhattan of the need for black people to take greater responsibility for addressing the violence in the black community and the necessity to develop stronger spiritual discipline. 
 "Look, men: We must make our community decent for our women, children and the elderly," said Mr. Farrakhan, whose organization provides security services for some urban areas plagued by drugs. "We can do it better than the police. If we clean up our communities, we will be able to walk the streets in peace and security."
The appearance of Mr. Farrakhan -- originally scheduled for three days before the Nov. 2 mayoral election -- was a heated issue during the campaign. Mr. Farrakhan, while admired by many young black people for his message of economic power and discipline, has been bitterly criticized by many people for his comments nine years ago calling Judaism a "gutter religion."
 
Embarrassment Feared
 The rally, originally scheduled for Yankee Stadium on Oct. 30, was seen as being potentially embarrassing to Mayor David N. Dinkins, who has often faulted the black Muslim leader. Rudolph W. Giuliani, then Mr. Dinkins's opponent, criticized the Mayor for allowing the minister to use the stadium, which is operated by the city. Mr. Giuliani said he would have sought to prevent Mr. Farrakhan from using the stadium, a stand that drew fire from many elected officials and the American Civil Liberties Union.
Ultimately, the speech was postponed, after some of the Mayor's close black political allies asked Mr. Farrakhan to wait until after the election.
Yesterday, before the speech, Mayor-elect Giuliani said Mr. Farrakhan's message in the past had been "despicable, and I think almost everyone in New York feels that way." Mr. Giuliani added that "he has a right, like others do, to express their opinion, even if you believe that opinion is despicable."
 
Two-Hour Speech
 Mr. Farrakhan's address attracted a cross-section of black New Yorkers, from Wall Street bankers and managers in Park Avenue corporations to high school dropouts and the unemployed. Some of the audience had to watch on closed-circuit television screens in an adjacent room.
The rally, at which Mr. Farrakhan made his first public speech in New York since an appearance at Madison Square Garden in 1985, also drew a collection of people representing celebrity and controversy. They ranged from the Rev. Al Sharpton, the political activist, and Leonard Jeffries, who was deposed and reinstated as head of the black studies department at City College, to Stephanie Mills, the Broadway singer and recording artist, and Wesley Snipes, the actor.
In the "Stop the Killing" rally, whose ticket prices ranged from $10 to $100, Mr. Farrakhan spoke for nearly two hours, touching on everything from a defense of the entertainer Michael Jackson to a perspective on the sexual misconduct of some Catholic priests.
Most of Mr. Farrakhan's speech dealt with topics religious and moral. Time and time again, he said that the reason for the violence within the black community was not only the proliferation of guns and drugs but also what he described as the decay of morality in the United States.
"The United States of America, the greatest nation on earth, invincible to any outside force," Mr. Farrakhan said, "is now vulnerable because of an internal rot and corruption." The country, he said "is a brilliant nation that can send men and women to outer space to correct a telescope, but can't help students out of high school with a 30 percent functional illiteracy. The morality of the country has gone to the depth of a bottomless pit."
 
Mostly the Young
 The rally was attended principally by young black men and women, many of whom stood in line waiting to enter for nearly an hour and most of whom were followers of Mr. Farrakhan. They included ever-courteous, crisply dressed men in dark suits and bow ties and women dressed all in white, with long dresses, gloves and hair coverings.
Some of Mr. Farrakhan's rhetoric was racially charged, suggesting frequently that the history of white Americans had been filled with instances of oppression of black, Hispanic and Asian people not only in the United States but abroad.
But he added: "I'm neither a racist nor an anti-Semite. But if I point out your evil with truth, then call me a preacher of truth. And if you will correct your behavior, then love will come as a result. But you can't pass hate on me."

HEADLINE: 1784 SPANISH SHIP IS FOUND IN GULF

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
A lost treasure ship whose sinking in 1784 played a minor role in the early history of the United States has been discovered in 300 feet of water about 50 miles off Louisiana and part of the cargo has been recovered, the finders reported last week.
The vessel, El Cazador, or the Hunter, had been sent by Spain from its port in New Orleans to pick up Mexican coins for its holdings in Louisiana, with the aim of stabilizing their currency. The ship's manifest listed 450,000 pesos. She left Veracruz, Mexico, on Jan. 11, 1784, but never arrived back in New Orleans. The ship was eventually declared lost. 
 As the Louisiana holdings failed to pick up economically, they were ceded by Spain in 1800 back to France, which sold them in 1803 to the United States as the Louisiana Purchase, doubling the size of the young republic.
The lost ship, an armed vessel called a brigantine of war, was about 90 feet long, with a shallow draft and two masts. She probably carried 18 guns, the finders said.
 
Found by Accident
 The wreckage was discovered by accident in August when a fishing vessel snagged its net on an underwater obstruction. The raised net dropped hundreds of coins onto the fishing vessel's deck, all of them minted in Mexico City and most of them dated 1783.
The fishing vessel's owner, Jim Reahard of Grand Bay, Ala., who sails out of Pascagoula, Miss., approached an admiralty lawyer in Key West, Fla., David Paul Horan, who then filed a claim on the wreck for Mr. Reahard. An underwater salvage concern, Marex International Inc. of Memphis, was hired to explore the site.
In September, Marex used a sonar and a small underwater robot to find the wreck. "It took only one hour to locate the target and then three days to properly photograph it with underwater video," Marex said in a statement. "Coins could be seen covering the wreck site."
In October and November, the company used divers and robots to begin recovery operations. To date, Marex said, the findings include some 12,000 silver coins as well as the ship's bell. The recovery operation was suspended last month because of rough weather.
 
Records From Spain
 Robert Stenuit, a historian in Brussels who studies old Spanish wrecks by using the Archives of the Indies, historical records kept in Seville, Spain, was hired to make an identification based on the evidence in hand.
His inquiry showed that no other large sum of cash from Mexico was lost by shipwreck in the Gulf of Mexico between 1783 and 1785, he wrote the finders. "It follows," Mr. Stenuit said, "that the wreck you found cannot be any other wreck but the one of the brig of war El Cazador."
Mr. Horan, the lawyer, said in a presentation in New Orleans on Dec. 6 that the overall salvage group, known as the Grumpy partnership, was "vitally interested in proper conservation of the artifacts and the educational aspects of this adventure." In the partnership, Myrna Reahard, the wife of the fishing vessel's owner, is in charge of counting the coins and keeping track of all the artifacts and recoveries from the wreck site.
Marex, in a statement, said that because of the depth of the water and the muddy bottom, the company "expects to find many historically significant artifacts in a good state of preservation."
Henry N. Hudson, a Marex vice president, said in a telephone interview on Friday: "We're hoping for a 70 to 80 percent recovery. In the salvage business that's a full recovery."
He added that the company expected to work the site of the historic wreck as weather permits.

HEADLINE: Atlanta's Olympic Park Plan Reveals The Complications of Urban Renewal

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, Dec. 18

 BODY:
Midway between Atlanta's surprise designation as the site of the next Summer Olympics and July 1996, when perhaps two million people will descend on Atlanta for the Games, time is running out for the grand dreams of urban renaissance that the Olympics fostered here.
And nothing to date has brought home the political, economic and racial complications that come with trying to mount an event as big as the Olympics in an American inner city as a proposal to bulldoze a ragged, 72-acre swath of downtown Atlanta for a park that could provide the focal point for the Games. 
 Supporters say the $100 million project would provide a much needed public gathering place for the Olympics and would generate new development that would transform a largely seedy part of downtown. Skeptics see the project as a dubious quick fix that would drain money from needy neighborhoods and leave behind a forlorn park and an inner city as poor after the Games as before.
 
Much at Stake
 At the least, however, the proposed Centennial Olympic Park is a reminder of how much is at stake in the Olympics, which are expected to have a $5.1 billion economic impact on Georgia, and how widespread are the fears that Atlanta is in danger of failing to capitalize on the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity 944 days away.
"The Olympics are like a flying saucer that's landed in the midst of a community," said Lyn May, an Olympic spokeswoman. "It's done exactly what you would expect in terms of raising expectations and creating fear and loathing. And the ultimate fear is that the flying saucer will take off and leave only scorched earth behind."
Organizers bill the Games, the 100th anniversary of the Olympics, as the largest single event in American history, one comparable to six Super Bowls a day for 17 days. But despite the boom they mean for the region around Atlanta, the Games will be held in the middle of a city that is 70 percent black, accounts for only 400,000 of the 2.7 million people in the metropolitan area, and is one of the poorest in the country.
Atlanta's successful bid for the Games set off widespread expectations of dramatic urban revitalization. Now, almost everyone agrees those expectations were wildly inflated.
"There was a sense the Olympics could do everything for everybody," said Billy Payne, President of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, known as ACOG. "Of course it was an over-expectation, because we have governments which financially are unable to help. But I don't think ACOG can even be remotely accused of not addressing our civic responsibilities."
From the start, Mr. Payne has stressed that his committee planned to raise $1.6 billion in private donations for the "inside-the-fence" aspects of the Olympics -- the competition sites, buildings and resources needed to put on the Games. The "outside-the-fence" aspects like road improvements, downtown renewal and refurbishing low-income areas adjacent to the Olympic sites were left to public bodies.
So far, the inside activities are roughly on schedule. And Olympic officials say they will leave behind $500 million in projects paid for with private money, including the $211 million Olympic stadium, athletic sites at the historically black Atlanta University Center and student housing at Georgia Tech and Georgia State University.
But outside, there are only glimmers of progress, like a $38 million Federal grant for the rehabilitation of a housing project that is between the Olympic Village and the proposed park.
 
Political Overtones
 Most of the obstacles are financial, caused by the city's small size and tax base and a public climate hostile to the spending of tax money to support the Games.
But the slow pace also has roots in politics and race, and the desire of the City of Atlanta to control Olympic-related development despite the suburban roots and largely white leadership at the organizing committee. The result was Mayor Maynard Jackson's establishment of the Corporation for Olympic Development, which was designated as the agency in charge of development plans. The agency has drawn up a list of $220 million in possible projects, most of them in 15 low-income neighborhoods near the Olympic events.
But the development corporation has no money and as a city venture it lacks the political clout of a broader metropolitan or statewide body. Mayor-elect Bill Campbell said one of his main priorities was to come up with money to further the agency's agenda. A bond issue or sales tax increase is possible but both face political obstacles.
"My challenge and the challenge of the city for the next three years is to try not to let any more time go by without rebuilding our infrastructure and improving our neighborhoods," he said in an interview. "It's going to take a commitment that will be unyielding for the next three years."
Amid growing concerns about the slow pace of development, Mr. Payne last month unveiled his $100 million plan for the park, which would be financed by businesses and foundations. He called for bulldozing 72 acres of downtown that now consists largely of rundown buildings and dingy warehouses. After the Olympics, about 20 acres would remain as a park and the rest would be developed.
For the Olympics the park has impeccable logic, replacing an eyesore between the Olympic Village and major arenas with a green oasis. Supporters include Atlanta's political leadership and its most powerful business interests.
But there are doubters as well, most conspicuously the operators of businesses in the area who would be displaced by the park.
"I feel such sorrow in my heart about this," said Thelma Grundy, owner of Thelma's Kitchen, a popular home-style restaurant that would be displaced. "When I first heard about it I almost fainted."
 
Effect on the Poor
 But many others who have seen the Olympics as an engine for neighborhood development see the park as both a competitor that will consume resources and a confirmation of fears that poor neighborhoods and their residents are more likely to be displaced than helped by the Games.
"Nobody's pulling for the neighborhoods," said Douglas Dean, President of Summerhill Neighborhood Inc., a development group in the low-income area near the stadium. "And let me tell you, if anyone thinks we can sponsor this Olympics by '96, and we don't change the quality of life for the underclass, they're going to be surprised. The underclass has gotten sophisticated enough, that if they don't get some help, they know how to irritate people who have got something."
The park proposal has such powerful interests behind it that few prominent people are willing to express reservations. But privately some are unconvinced that a downtown park would become anything other than a haven for the homeless. And many see in the plan, both in the way it was hatched and in its broad-brush urban renewal approach, a reminder that Atlanta's political leadership may have changed from white to black, but the real power has not.
"It's a vision sort of dropped from on high, another big fix," said Tom Weyandt, a former Atlanta Commissioner of Planning and Development. "But I think the soul of the city and the real vision of the city is in a lot of little things that this will distract us from and draw money away from."
Mr. Payne said Atlanta could do both.
"I will refer you to a moment in time when we started bidding for the Games, and people said, 'What is this crazy idiot out there doing, espousing an idea so big,' " he said.
Almost every Olympic city at some point finds itself anxiously pondering whether it is going to get everything done on time. But Atlanta's commitment to put on the Games without public money and the high aspirations that the Games would bring social uplift along with sport, pose particular hurdles to Atlanta. And everyone agrees that two-and-a-half years is not much time for all the things, including the park, that Atlanta wants to do. Even the park, which would be built on land now owned by almost 200 different people, is viewed a difficult task to accomplish.
"The time has already passed to use the Olympics as a stimulus for some of the things we've talked about," said Joe Martin, a local developer. "Plans are great. But plans without implementation mean nothing."

HEADLINE: Ex-Convict Slays 2 in Oklahoma

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: HUGO, Okla., Dec. 18

 BODY:
An ex-convict bought an assault rifle from a pawn shop and opened fire in a store parking lot on Friday, killing two people before driving down a dead-end road to end his own life.
Two other people were wounded outside the Wal-Mart store in this southeastern Oklahoma town of 6,000 people. The police are trying to find a motive for the attack by the gunman, David Mack Flinn, a 39-year-old convicted burglar who was unemployed. 
 Detectives from the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation said that hours before the shootings, Mr. Flinn lodged a complaint about a neighbor shooting his dog.
"I'll prosecute this myself," Mr. Flinn told a deputy before storming out of the sheriff's office. A Choctaw County Sheriff's deputy who checked out the complaint found no dog and no sign of violence at Mr. Flinn's house.
Mr. Flinn's next stop apparently was a pawn shop, where he lied about his string of theft and burglary convictions to buy the .223-caliber semiautomatic assault rifle and ammunition.
About two hours later, Luke Sheehan, 52, and Mary Sheehan, 49, were killed as they walked out of Wal-Mart, the bureau said.
Minutes later, Mr. Flinn was found dead in his truck on a dirt road a few miles away. Three guns and ammunition were in his truck. He killed himself with a single shot, Assistant District Attorney Larry Grant said.
The motive for Mr. Flinn's shooting spree remains a mystery, apart from a complaint about the dog.
"Basically this is just a random shooting," Assistant District Attorney Clark LeForce said.
Mr. Flinn's record lists a string of burglary and theft convictions in Pamona, Calif., and Dallas from 1976 to 1987. He also pleaded guilty in 1979 to a charge of assault with a deadly weapon in San Bernadino, Calif., records show.

HEADLINE: Russian Premier Assails Reformers in Cabinet for 'Poorly Thought-Out Experiments'

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 18

 BODY:
In another strong signal of a shift against economic reform after the Russian elections, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin was quoted today as scathingly accusing Westernized reformers in his own Cabinet of "poorly thought-out experiments" and a failure "to think about the people, for the sake of whom the reforms were started."
Mr. Chernomyrdin said the Government would now focus less on tight monetary and spending controls, which would reduce Russia's high rate of inflation, and more on social protection and on state and private investment to create jobs. 
 Russian voters stunned their leaders a week ago by voting in substantial numbers for the ultranationalist politician Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky and for the Communist and Agrarian parties. Expectations that pro-reform parties led by Government ministers would win a majority in the lower house of Parliament were dashed, and Mr. Zhirinovsky will end up with the second-biggest bloc of seats there.
Speaking to the trade-union newspaper Trud in an interview, Mr. Chernomyrdin blamed his reformist colleagues for the election results.
 
People Voted 'Against'
 "We should face the truth and admit that many people voted not so much for a particular platform or party as against the hardships and mistakes of the current reforms," the Prime Minister said. "As many as 35 million Russians live below the poverty line, which means that some 30 percent of the electorate were potentially 'against.' "
"Naturally," Mr. Chernomyrdin continued, "any 'shock' methods must be precluded in the future."
That reference was to the economic policies of Yegor T. Gaidar, who is the First Deputy Prime Minister and the leader of the reformist party Russia's Choice. He is also Mr. Chernomyrdin's predecessor, having been forced out of Government a year ago by the old Parliament.
Mr. Gaidar is considered the chief of the Government's Westernized reformers, including Privatization Minister Anatoly B. Chubais and Finance Minister Boris G. Fyodorov, who are pressing for stepped-up reform as the best response to the economic misery felt by voters.
Mr. Chernomyrdin has clearly takenanother view, something that President Boris N. Yeltsin may also choose to do when he finally speaks to the nation about the elections next week.
 
'Personal Defeat' Seen
 "The election defeat is a personal evaluation of Gaidar's work, but not as a representative of the whole Government, but as the person responsible for the Economy Ministry," Mr. Chernomyrdin said. "The same goes for Chubais. It's his personal defeat. So they should think it over hard. They have a lot to think about now."
In essence, Mr. Chernomyrdin seemed to be suggesting that Mr. Gaidar and Mr. Chubais resign.
If they have a lot to think about, as Mr. Chernoymrdin put it, so does the West. The United States and other Western nations have generally approached Russian economic reform through the agency of the International Monetary Fund, which is known for its emphasis on controlling inflation through controls on Government spending. This week, Vice President Al Gore criticized the fund and its member nations for insensitivity to the plight of Russians who lost their jobs because of sharp cuts in Russian military spending.
"Every country with representatives on the I.M.F. board has been slow to recognize the hardship caused by some of what has been done in the past," Mr. Gore said in Moscow on Thursday. "That may cause a diplomatic incident, but I don't care."
 
Gore Meets Chernomyrdin
 Mr. Gore spoke after a series of meetings with Mr. Chernomyrdin. The two men are chairmen of a joint committee on the problems involved in converting Russia's huge military sector so it can produce civilian products.
The fund argues that its loans can be useful only if Russia achieves genuine economic stability. Privately, fund officials say that if the Clinton Administration and the West now want to start a welfare program to keep Russian workers employed and happy, they should do it directly.
It is inevitable, senior diplomats said, that the Group of Seven major industrialized countries review their policy toward Russia. If a significant shift takes place in Russian policy, the West may decide to concentrate less on aid to the Government than on aid directly aimed at the growing private sector.
In the interview, Mr. Chernomyrdin emphasized nonetheless that reforms were still needed. "It was a correct decision to reform," he said. "But it is also true that serious miscalculations were made and that no one thought about the near future and the people, for the sake of whom the reforms were started."
 
'Very Dangerous' Experiments
 "Russia is no small country," he continued, "and poorly thought-out experiments are very dangerous in this case."
No politician in Russia is against "reform." Even Mr. Zhirinovsky professes to favor it. But when Mr. Chernomyrdin talks of reform, he has in mind a much slower, statist policy than Mr. Gaidar or the International Monetary Fund does.
Mr. Chernomyrdin spoke today, as he usually does, of increasing Russian industrial production as the highest priority. The Westernized economists stress the need to reduce the monthly inflation rate of 15 percent, which makes it difficult for Russia to secure private investment or restructure its industries.
Government figures indicate that Russian industrial production has stopped falling, although many factories are limping along on Government subsidies and delays in paying debts they owe to one another.
 
Unworried by Inflation
 While Mr. Gaidar views the current rate of inflation as prohibitive and dangerous, Mr. Chernomyrdin said today that it was fine, adding: "Rigid monetary policy has played its role. Now the time has come for investments and production."
Russia must "carry out an industrial revolution," much as Germany and Japan did after World War II, he said, to produce modern, competitive products. But Washington is hardly likely to provide a Marshall Plan for Russia these days.
In St. Petersburg, Mr. Gore said on Friday that United States support "for Boris Yeltsin's proposals here in Russia are linked to Boris Yeltsin's commitment to reform and democracy, and the support for him is just as strong as his support for these principles."
But Washington is now reflecting on what kind of democracy and what kind of reform Russia will embrace.
Mr. Chernomyrdin, who did not run in the Dec. 12 elections but supported a centrist bloc of another Deputy Prime Minister, Sergei Shakrai, is expected to remain Prime Minister in a shuffled government. That is in part because of his generally centrist views and calm management style, and in part because Mr. Yeltsin is unlikely to want to give the new Parliament the chance to confirm or reject a new prime minister.
 
Subsidized Loans Approved
 The post-election trend toward slowing reform was visible on Friday when Mr. Yeltsin decreed $120 million in cheap, subsidized loans to agricultural enterprises, and when the Government approved a weaker privatization program over the objections of Mr. Gaidar and Mr. Chubais at a meeting led by a close ally of Mr. Chernomyrdin, Oleg Soskovets.
Mr. Yeltsin also decreed new immigration controls on Russia's frontiers and new rules for employing non-Russians, to reduce the number of people from former Soviet republics seeking work and refuge here, one of Mr. Zhirinovsky's biggest complaints.
Mr. Chernomyrdin, after lambasting Mr. Gaidar and his allies for what has been the policy of his own Government for a year, said, "We should not blame now those who launched this great undertaking, but examine calmly the progress of reforms and past mistakes."
But it now seems likely that Mr. Gaidar, while leading the biggest bloc of votes in the new lower house of Parliament, will soon find himself demoted, at the least, and very possibly out of government once more.

HEADLINE: Traveling to Camden

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
In a state frequently given to bizarre political playmaking, it should come as little surprise that a professional basketball team is at the center of the latest political dispute in New Jersey.
But a decision by the owner of the Philadelphia 76ers of the National Basketball Association to begin talks about moving his team across the Delaware River to Camden has put Gov. Jim Florio and Governor-elect Christine Todd Whitman at odds publicly and set off a political debate. 
 It has also revived memories of a high-stake political fight 20 years ago, which also fell during a gubernatorial transition, when New Jersey lured the New York Giants of the National Football League to a patch of swampy land just west of Manhattan.
Frustrated in his efforts to have a new arena built in Philadelphia, the 76ers' owner, Harold Katz, began negotiating with Mr. Florio about moving the team to Camden shortly before the Nov. 2 election, in which Mrs. Whitman defeated Mr. Florio. Both sides say that they expect an agreement within a few days.
 
Paying for Itself
 The question now is whether a new $80 million arena, which is what it would take to lure the 76ers to Camden, could pay for itself.
Governor Florio, who is privy to a confidential feasibility study by the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, has said yes.
Mayor Edward G. Rendell of Philadelphia, who is eager to keep the 76ers and who has a chorus of fiscal experts backing him, has said no.
And a cautious Mrs. Whitman, backed by an even more reticent Republican-controlled Legislature, has given a very qualified maybe, saying that she will support the deal only if it there is no cost to taxpayers.
Saddled with what he has called the worst lease in professional sports -- an arrangement in which he pays rent to Spectacor, the parent company of the Philadelphia Flyers of the National Hockey League, to play in the Spectrum -- Mr. Katz has long been on the lookout for a better deal.
 
Philadelphia Deal Dies
 Once before, in 1989, Mr. Katz and the Flyers' owner, Ed Snider, flirted with New Jersey officials about building a new arena in Camden that they would jointly own. But with incentives from Philadelphia, the two men agreed to help build a new arena to replace the Spectrum, the 18,168-seat center that has been the 76ers' home since it opened in September 1967.
Late last month, after many revisions, the deal fell apart and Mr. Katz again turned to Camden.
The new talks have had a special urgency, partly because Mr. Florio leaves office in a month and partly because Mr. Katz faces a Feb. 1 deadline to decide whether to continue the 76ers' lease at the Spectrum.
Luring the 76ers to Camden would allow Mr. Florio to leave office on a political high. It would also be a plum to the city that has been the base of his political fief during his nearly 30 years in politics.
 
Whitman Fears Bond Debt
 If things proceed as Mr. Katz and Mr. Florio want, come the 1995-96 N.B.A. season, the Philadelphia 76ers, as they will still be called, will be playing in a new arena on the Camden riverfront, built near the state's new aquarium with bonds issued by the Sports and Exposition Authority. The authority's revenue to pay off the bonds would come from the new arena, not its other properties.
Mrs. Whitman, who ran on a pledge to cut state taxes and spending, is worried that the proposed arena may not generate enough income to pay off the $80 million in bonds.
"We are waiting until a review by our staff is completed," said Mrs. Whitman's chief spokesman, Carl Golden. "She is very sensitive to her obligation that taxpayers not be called upon to pay for a new arena."
Mr. Golden said Mrs. Whitman would not object to Mr. Florio's concluding a deal with the 76ers before she takes office on Jan. 18, but only if her concerns are satisfied.
 
Impact on Philadelphia
 Mr. Rendell has played down the economic impact that the departure of the 76ers would cost his city, whose residents would still provide most of the fans. He has said the direct economic impact to the city -- taxes, parking and concession revenues -- amounts to $1 million to $1.5 million a year from the N.B.A. franchise, not counting the indirect benefits like hotel and restaurant income.
"But we would rather not lose the $1.5 million and whatever indirect economic benefit, and we would rather not lose the prestige of being one of the few cities in the country with all four professional sports teams within the city limits," said the Mayor's chief of staff, David L. Cohen.
Philadelphia's City Hall has given out a memo with what it called "some observations on the financial status" of the Sports Authority.
It concluded that the Authority's cash flow from the Meadowlands and its other sites does not cover its debt service -- a $12 million to $18 million shortfall, according to the document -- and that "there are no excess funds to subsidize a new arena."
 
Silence From Sports Authority
 The Sports Authority has refused to comment publicly on the negotiations. Privately, they call Philadelphia's response sour grapes.
New Jersey went through a similar but much more rancorous debate in the early 1970's when its departing Governor, William T. Cahill, started a push for development of the Meadowlands complex in East Rutherford and began talks to bring the New York Giants to the proposed stadium.
New York fought bitterly to stall the project, using the Rockefeller family to try to discourage bond investors from financing the project.

HEADLINE: A Flat Economy Is Forecast For the Island's Near Future

BYLINE: By JOHN T. McQUISTON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HAUPPAUGE, L.I., Dec. 16

 BODY:
The Long Island economy will remain flat for the next few years, with a surge of job growth and industrial development around the turn of the century and through the year 2010, according to a study by the Long Island Regional Planning Board.
After World War II, Long Island had the fastest growing economy in the nation, the report said, but with the end of the cold war, growth has come to a standstill. More than 100,000 jobs were lost over the last four and a half years, many of them high-paying jobs with military contractors. 
 Since every manufacturing job represents a multiplier impact of at least two to one, the impact of the loss of defense jobs has been substantial, said Pearl M. Kamer, chief economist for the board.
As a result, she said, Long Island has been slow to recover from the recession, and the options for a quick recovery are limited. She said the job losses may end next year, with the possible gain of at least 5,000. If there is any growth "it will be moderate," she said.
 
White-Collars Affected
 She said the downsizing of the military industry is only part of the structural changes on the Island. Many white-collar workers are also being displaced because of automation.
Moreover, there are significant local impediments to a sound economy, the report said. They include high taxes, high energy costs, transportation inefficiencies, lack of affordable housing and a negative business climate.
"The two top negatives holding back the Island's economy are the cost of energy and taxes," said Lee E. Koppelman, the planning board's executive director. "The cost of both electricity and property tax rates remain the highest in the country, making it difficult for the Island to compete in the world marketplace for new industries."
Long Island's population leveled off at 2.6 million in the mid-1970's, but there have been significant changes in the racial composition of the population.
Between 1980 and 1990, the Island's white population declined by 84,000, or about 4 percent, while its black population increased by 31,000 persons, or 19 percent. The Hispanic population increased by 63,000, or 62 percent, while the Asian population rose by 38,000, or 250 percent.
 
10th-Biggest Area
 As of 1990, the Island ranked as the 10th most populous metropolitan statistical area in the United States and larger than that of 20 states.
Service industries have replaced the defense sector as the Island's dominant employer in terms of both employment and income generation. These include jobs in supermarkets, financial institutions, transportation, communications utilities and health-care facilities.
Only one manufacturer, the Grumman Corporation, remained among the 10 largest non-governmental employers on Long Island as of 1993. Grumman, which employed nearly 30,000 people in 1980, now has less than 12,000 workers.
To fill the void created by declines in military manufacturing, the panel recommends targeting certain key manufacturing industries, including biotechnology and biomedical research and information technology.
 
Educational Challenge
 To help use the scientific and technical skills of displaced military workers, the report urged the Island's higher educational institutions to rise to the challenge with a diverse array of advanced graduate programs.
The panel urged colleges and universities to abandon their "ivory tower" mentality and adopt a pragmatic approach that will equip large segments of the Island's adult population with the skills needed by regional employers.
Among the plan's other key recommendations is a $22 million military conversion fund to help manufacturers. Suffolk County has allocated $500,000 and Nassau is to consider a similar amount when it votes on its 1994 budget early next week. The state government would contribute $2 million and a consortium of banks would provide the rest of the money.
The report also calls for commercial air cargo service at Calverton Airport, a repeal of the 5 percent state tourism tax on rooms costing more than $100, the importation of cheaper gas and electricity from Canada and upstate New York and property tax abatements to aid strategic new industries.
Matthew T. Crosson, president of the Long Island Association, the region's principal business and civic organization, welcomed the findings of the planning board. He said the L.I.A. intended to use the report as a research base and springboard for an economic summit in September.
"We hope to work very closely with leaders in government and the private sector to build a consensus on what needs to be done and ways to convert it into action," Mr. Crosson said.

HEADLINE: Contemplating a Future Without Jobs

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FULTON, N.Y., Dec. 13

 BODY:
With the shortened days of December, happy hour at the Canal Point Restaurant and Bar here gets an early start. By 4:30 P.M. on a recent Friday, the small, wood-paneled barroom was already crowded and abuzz with two dozen people. Most had cans of Miller beer in front of them.
"I'll probably always drink it," said Ralph Thompson. "It's a good beer." 
 "I'll keep drinking it for now," said Bob Scheemaker. "But I could re-evaluate that next year. I'll have to see."
Ordinarily, loyalty to a brand of beer is evidence of little more than personal taste or a successful advertising campaign. But the situation here is different. Mr. Thompson, Mr. Scheemaker, and almost everyone else in this room work at a Miller brewery less than a mile away. They make the beer; and it's tempting to view their choice whether to drink it now as a referendum of sorts. Because, in all likelihood, these employees and more than 700 colleagues will be losing their jobs.
The Phillip Morris Companies, the consumer-products giant that owns the Miller Brewing Company, announced on Dec. 1 that it plans to close the 1.2 million-square-foot Miller brewery, which lies in Oswego County in the town of Volney, about 25 miles north of Syracuse. Of the plant's 731 employees, 300 are scheduled to be laid off in January 1994. The rest are expected to be gone by October 1994. The call-back list for 170 workers who were laid off workers earlier will be thrown out.
 
Dropping Beer Sales
 The shutdown is part of a larger Phillip Morris reorganization plan, unveiled Nov. 24, that will eliminate an estimated 14,000 jobs over the next three years. The move comes amid projections that Phillip Morris' 1993 earnings will be 16 percent lower than in 1992.
The 17-year-old Volney plant, which sits less than a mile from the Fulton city line, would be the only one of Miller's seven breweries to close. Company officials blame the choice primarily on sagging beer sales in the Northeast. And in that sagging market, Miller trailed Anheuser-Busch, whose leading beers carry the Budweiser label.
"I wasn't too surprised to hear about it -- the rumor mill became too hard to ignore," said Mr. Scheemaker, 39, a 17-year Miller veteran who runs filling and labeling machines in the packaging department. "There were already some layoffs and we kind of had a little cloud up over our heads."
Yet others, including union leaders, said they were shocked.
"When they announced it to us, it was like we were in a boxing ring and I got knocked down," said Tim Phillips, president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers Local 2587.
 
'Best Kept Secrets'
 Denis Ray is the union's secretary-treasurer. "We got absolutely no advance notice," said Mr. Ray. "It was one of the best kept secrets that they have ever had."
Since the announcement, the machinists' union has been holding private talks with Miller officials in an effort to keep the brewery open. There has been no indication so far that the company will reverse its decision.
"I think the problem goes beyond concessions," said Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
Saying there is little chance of keeping the Miller brewery open, Mr. Cuomo has instead assembled a team of state officials to work with local authorities and lure a new business, not necessarily a brewer, to the site. "It won't be easy," said Mr. Cuomo. "But we're certainly looking."
If a new occupant is not found, Oswego County and the roughly 20,000 people who live in the Fulton area may have a difficult time ahead.
"Unemployment rates will see a steep climb," said Roger Evans, an economist with the New York State Department of Labor. "If all the Miller layoffs happened right now, we'd see the unemployment rate in the county increase from 6.7 percent up to 8.4 percent," Mr. Evans said. "But even broken out over a longer time, the layoffs will still be a devastating blow."
Mr. Evans said an additional, long-term ripple effect could eliminate one or two jobs in the community for every position lost at Miller.
At an estimated $19 an hour, Miller's average wage is one of the highest in Central New York manufacturing.
"I've got a better chance of seeing God than to find a similar paying job," said George Gridley, 47, who works in the brewing section.
For Victor Blair, a 43-year-old packaging department worker and his family, the imminent layoff has done more than just serve up a pink slip. It has jeopardized a dream.
Nearly two years ago, Mr Blair, his wife Teresa, and their two sons moved from a cramped, three-bedroom house near the brewery to a new home five miles into the country. Aside from laying the foundation and erecting the outer walls, Mr. Miller built the house himself.
Sitting around the dining room table, the family nodded in agreement when Mr. Blair said, "We love it here."
They are determined to keep the house if they can, but there is money owed to the contractor, a mortgage and college loan repayments for a son who was recently laid off.
Still Mr. Blair is lucky to be in the last wave of layoffs. That gives his wife time to look for work and gives him time to explore opening a business of his own, repairing small engines.
Mr. Blair's youngest son, Ryan, 15, standing in his classically teen-age bedroom, with posters on the wall and shoeboxes filled with sports trading cards, stared at the carpet.
"All the things I used to think about: my cards; stuff at school; or maybe buying clothes, now I never think about them anymore," he said. "I guess maybe everything's sort of confusing me."

HEADLINE: Helping the Neediest Women

 BODY:
A refugee arrives in New York from Belarus. At 56, she has endured for decades a marriage to an abusive, alcoholic husband who has, at least once, come close to killing her. She speaks no English; but immigrant organizations help her to adjust. They arrange English classes. As her confidence grows, she finds the courage, for the first time in her life, to ask for help.
In desperation, she calls the agency that has already helped her so much, an agency supported in part by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. She finds herself in the office of Victoria Neznansky, a vibrant young woman from Odessa who speaks her language, understands her plight, tells her she's not alone and offers support. 
 Ms. Neznansky was such an immigrant herself in 1989. The New York Association for New Americans, supported by the United Jewish Appeal, helped her to find a home, friends and a job. Eventually she won a scholarship to study at New York University for a master's degree in social work. Once she got her degree, she returned to the agency that had helped her. She works with immigrant women from the former Soviet Union who suffer from domestic violence.
Many of these women come from rural societies in which a wife is considered her husband's property. Often they adjust more quickly than their husbands to life in the United States, learning English faster and enjoying their new-found freedom. But freedom for a wife can mean humiliation for her husband. Sometimes the last straw comes when a woman finds work and her husband is still unemployed. With their status in the immigrant community diminished and feeling they are losing control of their families, some husbands turn violent. Others continue a pattern started in the old country, where such abuse was tolerated.
Sometimes, Ms. Neznansky finds, talking to such a husband can help. She explains that this kind of behavior is against the law here. She sympathizes with the difficulty of adjusting to new ways. But she also cautions that if his wife is in danger, as a professional she is obliged to call on law enforcement to protect her. She offers her help. She estimates that in 40 percent of these cases the husband's behavior changes. For the others, she arranges new housing and support to help the wife start a new life.
Ms. Neznansky is one of many people working for agencies supported by the Neediest Cases Fund who have started as clients and ended up as helpers.
In her own case, her drive, her command of the language (she taught English in Odessa before emigrating) and her determination not to depend on welfare caught the attention of agency workers. They felt she would be a good interpreter and hired her. Eventually, after getting her degree, she returned to the work she is doing now -- partly with the help of Times readers who have contributed to the Neediest Cases Fund.
The fund channels all contributions to social service organizations; none is held back for administration or solicitation. The money could end up paying the rent for a young mother who needs to escape an abusive relationship -- or for some other life-saving form of help.
Contributions are tax-deductible to the extent permitted by law, and any amount is welcome. Checks should be payable to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund and mailed to Post Office Box 5193, General Post Office, New York, N.Y. 10087.

HEADLINE: Segregation's Threat to the Economy

 BODY:
According to a Harvard University study, the nation's schools are now more segregated than they have been in 25 years. The segregation is not only racial, with more and more African-American and Latino students attending schools with predominantly minority enrollment. It is also economic, with more minority students from low-income families clustered together.
The nation long ago recognized that integration was a moral and political imperative. These statistics also make clear that to remain economically viable and competitive, the United States cannot keep pushing large numbers of black and Latino children further and further to the margins of society. Fully one-third of those entering the work force in the next decade will be minorities. It makes no sense to keep so many of these future workers isolated in schools that are educationally inferior. 
 The study was conducted by the Harvard Project on School Desegregation and led by Gary Orfield, a professor of education. He and his researchers looked at patterns of segregation across the country in 1991-92.
They found that 66 percent of black public school students were in schools where enrollment was more than 50 percent black or Latino or both. That's the highest level since 1968 when 76 percent of black students attended such schools. Latino students were even more segregated, with 73 percent at schools that were predominantly minority.
The researchers attributed the increasing concentration of minority students to higher birth rates and immigration, rather than to flight of white students. But school and housing segregation tend to go hand in hand.
Several other factors, separately and together, help guarantee the isolation of low-income minority children. Many neighborhoods are not economically diverse and states often restrict students to their neighborhood schools by drawing smaller and smaller school-district lines.
A 1974 Supreme Court decision discouraged desegregation remedies that crossed district lines. And 12 years of Federal policies during the Reagan and Bush Administrations virtually wiped out funding for voluntary desegregation efforts and encouraged legal efforts to terminate successful desegregation orders.
Making matters worse, districts with concentrations of poor, minority students generally have less political clout than affluent white districts and are often shortchanged in funding by state legislatures. But while efforts to equalize funding should continue, improving the life prospects of these students requires the targeting of extra resources -- and a re-commitment to the ideal of integration.
Professor Orfield recommends more Federal funding to encourage voluntary desegregation efforts, using tools like magnet schools and consolidation of districts. He would also link Federal housing funds to school desegregation efforts. And in newly desegregated schools, he thinks more funding should be provided to train teachers and develop multicultural curriculums.
Since the work force is becoming increasingly diverse, it's worse than shortsighted not to educate all future employees to their fullest potential. And it is easier for a diverse group of employees to work together if they share common educational experiences. That makes school desegregation not just an essential political goal, but a matter of economic strength as well.

HEADLINE: The Clinton Challenge in Russia

 BODY:
President Clinton has dismissed Vladimir Zhirinovsky's surprisingly strong showing in Russia's election as a protest vote by citizens who may not have known much about him. But the support for this virulent nationalist may reflect more than the mood of the moment.
Many Russians fear radical reform and respond to the appeal of nationalism. They share Mr. Zhirinovsky's nostalgia for the good old days of empire when Russia kept "lesser breeds" under heel. 
 To head him off, President Boris Yeltsin may preach more populism and nationalism himself. That will make Americans uneasy and will frighten Poles, Czechs and others in Russia's neighborhood.
Mr. Zhirinovsky's showing raises two important issues for the Clinton Administration. Should it continue to push for economic reforms that could jeopardize the reformers' political survival by identifying them too closely with the West and by increasing misery among the Russian people? And what should it do to reassure jittery Eastern Europeans -- extend NATO membership to them at the risk of an anti-Western reaction in Russia?
Mr. Zhirinovsky's 78 seats will give him a loud but not decisive voice in the new 450-member State Duma, the lower house of Parliament. The Communist Party and its rural ally, the Agrarian Party, will have another sizable bloc. While these two parties will resist reform, they are less likely to form a feared "Red-Brown" coalition with Mr. Zhirinovsky than to hold themselves out as an alternative to him and to the democratic reformers.
The threat from the far right and old left may finally compel the reformers to coalesce, but it will probably strengthen the gradualists. Indeed, some reformers are backtracking. The U.S. has no need to push a particular pace or brand of economic reform. It can back reformers of all stripes so long as they do not return Russia to its old autocratic ways.
Washington must also do much more to reassure Eastern Europe. The best approach is to lower barriers to trade and immigration and open the door to closer security cooperation. But it is provocative to talk about NATO membership prematurely. It is vital to keep NATO intact as insurance in case Russia really becomes belligerent; NATO doesn't need another divisive debate now.
For now Eastern Europeans have at least as much to fear from one another as from Russia. The resurgence of Russian nationalism is a long way from reviving the Red Army and moving to restore the empire.
Extending NATO's security guarantee to Eastern Europe now while excluding Russia would only fire up Russian nationalism and seriously weaken Russia's reformers. And Americans are no more ready to commit their troops in Eastern Europe than they were eager to intervene in Bosnia.
Past Western appeasement that led to the dismemberment of Eastern Europe half a century ago hangs heavy on the hearts and minds of many Eastern Europeans. But the appeasers of the 1930's faced a Hitler already in power. Today's challenge is to keep a new Hitler from taking power, in Russia or elsewhere. That means reassuring Eastern Europeans without isolating Russia and undermining its reformers.

HEADLINE: Millions for Us, Pennies for You

BYLINE: By KURT EICHENWALD

 BODY:
BEATRICE GINDEA thought the lawyers were on her side. Now she's not so sure.
In 1988, the retiree invested $10,000 -- a large chunk of her nest egg -- in a real estate fund sponsored by Prudential-Bache Securities through the firm's Morristown, N.J., office. It seemed like a good investment -- Prudential guaranteed her 12 percent annually for three years, and then all her money back. But the promises were false, and the investment collapsed. 
 Last month, when the check to settle her claim against Prudential and other defendants finally arrived, Mrs. Gindea was aghast. "Out of the $10,000, I thought I would only see 50 percent of it back," she said. Instead, she got $423.53. For every dollar she had invested, Mrs. Gindea received a bit more than four pennies.
"I was astonished," Mrs. Gindea said. "I thought I was being cheated."
Meanwhile, the law firm that represented Mrs. Gindea and thousands of others in the class action was paid as much as $6 million in fees, plus expenses. Adding to the sting, some investors in the same fund who sued separately came away with far more money -- sometimes more than 100 percent of their investment, plus interest and legal fees.
Many thousands of limited-partnership investors like Mrs. Gindea are learning the troubling truth about class-action litigation brought in their names. Without ever going to the effort of a trial to fight for a better deal, the law firms representing these investors can win approval for settlements of a few cents on the dollar for their clients while pocketing millions of dollars -- even tens of millions -- in legal fees for themselves. The class-action lawyers argue that their clients could have done no better, but that is cold comfort for those who watch some fellow investors who have hired their own lawyers go to trial or arbitration and then come away fully compensated.
Even more frustrating for such investors, anyone who is part of a class-action settlement waives all rights to further claims, even if the Government later affirms accusations of fraud against the partnership. For example, investors who earlier settled with Prudential in class actions for a small fraction of their investment are excluded from sharing in a fund of $371 million set up in October to repay some losses by customers who had been falsely assured about the safety and returns of the partnerships.
 
The Players
 A number of law firms have staked out business in class actions involving limited partnerships. Milberg Weiss Bershad Specthrie & Lerach, in New York City, for example, represented Mrs. Gindea. Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, also in New York, is the lead counsel in the action involving the Prudential Bache Energy Income Funds.
But the most active in the field may well be the small Chicago law firm called Beigel & Sandler Ltd. Run by Herbert Beigel, a onetime prosecutor of mob members, it has made millions off the travails of limited-partnership investors. And some critics say the amounts it has made and the way it has done so epitomize what is wrong with this part of the legal system.
A review of cases involving the firm by The New York Times shows that Beigel & Sandler has never taken a significant class action to trial, settling rather than fighting for a bigger award even when it had a strong case. At the same time, the firm that so many investors are trusting to recover their investments has been repeatedly criticized by Federal judges for sloppy legal work and frivolous filings.
But Mr. Beigel said such criticism and setbacks are the price of playing in the class-action arena. He said the small amounts he wins for investors in class-action settlements are better than what would come out of a case that goes to court, where many judges have no sympathy for those they view as having gambled on an investment and lost.
"That's the reason you see cheap settlements," Mr. Beigel said. "These cases have a chance of losing and they are thrown out constantly."
In the settlements that have been reached, Mr. Beigel said, "we like to think we have done a good job in some very difficult cases."
But Mr. Beigel does not dismiss critics out of hand. "No one should be in a class action who has a strong individual claim," he said, "except for a person whose claim is of such small monetary value that it would be economically unfeasible to bring a claim any other way."
Those kinds of small-claim cases are largely responsible for the rapid growth in class actions over the last two decades. Such litigation has been used in many kinds of disputes, from product liability to price fixing, and lawyers often receive multimillion-dollar fees from the settlements. But class actions alleging fraud at investment partnerships are notable in that most plaintiffs have suffered huge losses rather than small ones, and therefore have a lot more to lose in an unsatisfactory settlement.
One problem is that lawyers representing investors in a class action don't need their approval of a settlement. Of course, investors can opt out of a class action and sue on their own. But most can't afford it.
Given the outcome of many of the limited-partnership class actions, some experts are asking whether the time has come for reform.
"Class actions are not an appropriate vehicle for people who have lost substantial sums of money," said Samantha Rabin, senior editor of Securities Arbitration Commentator, a newsletter in Maplewood, N.J. "The only people who make money in these are the claimants' lawyers, and the defendants themselves, who shut off a lot of potential liability."
Many critics hesitate to raise objections, in part because class actions are the only option for some investors, particularly those without money for legal fees or with losses too small to attract lawyers willing to work for a portion of what they win. Nevertheless, some are urging efforts to disclose more clearly to investors what they would receive in a settlement, to force higher standards in determining a deal's fairness, and to insure that fees reflect how clients fared.
"We don't want to turn back the clock and restrict plaintiff's attorneys from bringing suit," said Nancy Smith, New Mexico's securities regulator. "But we should take a sober view and make an assessment of how investors are faring in these kinds of class actions and determine what reforms might be necessary."
A GOOD place to begin that assessment might be at Beigel & Sandler. Flip through the filings in most major class actions against limited partnerships, and chances are its name will pop up.
Beigel & Sandler was the lead counsel in one of two 1991 settlements involving investments with VMS Realty that were sold through the firm now known as Prudential Securities. It was lead counsel in settlements involving Prudential deals sponsored by Clifton Harrison, a convicted felon whose past was not disclosed to investors. The firm also participated in the settlement involving the Prudential energy income partnerships. And it was lead counsel in reaching a settlement with Merrill Lynch over the Arvida partnerships.
Many of these deals have been widely criticized as inadequate. "From what I have seen of their previous cases, they have generally settled for a small fraction of the recovery sought," James Beckley, a Chicago lawyer who is a member of the Securities Industry Conference on Arbitration, said of Beigel & Sandler.
The class action involving VMS Realty illustrates how firms can accept low-paying settlements, sometimes sacrificing some investor protections, yet still collect large fees.
The $25 million deal Beigel & Sandler negotiated left investors with less than two cents on the dollar. But Beigel & Sandler walked away with more than $6 million in fees -- the 25 percent typically authorized by the court in class actions -- as well as $350,000 for expenses and additional fees for administering the settlement fund. For all that money, the firm did less court work than some lawyers representing individual clients who went to court or arbitration to fight for full compensation. Those lawyers made far less money for their efforts.
As part of the settlement, Beigel & Sandler waived the rights the investors had, through their partnership agreement, to approve of any future sales of properties held by the VMS partnerships. This created "the potential for sales that might benefit VMS and not provide cash to the investors, but instead leave them with a big tax bill to pay," said Jack VanWoerkom, a real estate consultant in Marblehead, Mass.
All in all, "it was a great deal for the defendant, and it was a great deal for Beigel & Sandler, but it was a pretty lousy deal for the investors," Mr. VanWoerkom said.
Mr. Beigel said the settlements were low because the cases would have been very hard to prove in a trial. Indeed, he said that shortly after some of the defendants settled part of the VMS case, suits against other defendants were thrown out.
But others see it differently. The problem, say legal experts, is that once a deal is on the table, any class-action lawyer would find it hard to walk away from the millions in fees.
"THE lawyers' interest shifts from protecting the investor to protecting the deal," said John L. Grayson, a Houston lawyer who represents a number of plaintiffs involved in Prudential litigation. "If there is not a deal, the attorneys don't get paid, and the litigation drags on."
The only protection for investors comes from the judges who must determine that a deal is fair before approving it. But too often, lawyers said, the judges are under pressure to get the deal done.
Only by writing to the court with a declaration to opt out can an investor reject the settlement. Many of these people are unsophisticated in finance and law, yet must decide whether to walk away on the basis of a disclosure notice written in thick legalese.
"People don't understand the class-action notices, even people who have been relatively successful in business," Mr. Beckley said.
The notices are written by lawyers, and approved by a judge. But everyone involved -- from the plaintiffs' lawyers looking for fees, to the defendant hoping to close off liability, to the judge interested in cleaning out the docket -- has an interest in getting the deal approved. That, some lawyers say, causes all the parties to approve confusing language that leads investors to accept the deal.
HERBERT BEIGEL cut his teeth in Chicago in the early 1970's as part of the Justice Department's organized-crime strike force. A decade ago he formed his own firm with a single associate, just as Wall Street was quickening its drive to sell limited partnerships in assets like real estate and oil. With the collapse of many partnerships, Mr. Beigel found a niche.
Today, Mr. Beigel -- with offices in New York and Los Angeles, and teamed with Louis Sandler, a lawyer in Manhattan -- oversees some 40 lawyers, with specialties not only in limited partnerships but also matrimonial and entertainment law.
Beigel & Sandler has re-invented the class action to what critics say is the firm's own benefit. Where in a conventional class action lawyers assume all risk, with payment fixed as a percentage of money won, Beigel & Sandler in some cases requires each investor to put up a retainer of as much as several thousand dollars.
Mr. Beigel said that clients in such cases, which he calls group actions, do better than those in class actions, because once there is a settlement, there are fewer people with whom to divide the pot, because only those who pay are part of the group.
But critics say that group actions allow Beigel & Sandler to pursue cases while shifting the risk onto the clients. Moreover, at the end, the firm's fees are not subject to court approval, as they would be in a traditional class action, because technically the lawyer and the client have already agreed on fees.
Beigel & Sandler at times spends more on a case than might have been expected, simply because the firm is ordered so often by judges to pay sanctions for doing a bad job.
Sometimes, the judges criticize the firm for submitting silly claims that evidence little work. "The court is confronted with 27 equally frivolous complaints filed by the same law firm, Beigel & Sandler," wrote Judge Thomas P. Griesa of Federal District Court in Manhattan in April 1992 in Kushner v. D.B.G. Properties (a limited partnership). "It appears to the court as if the complaints were spun out of a word-processed original, with little attention to the details of each partnership and its private placement memorandum. Each complaint is as groundless as the next."
Judge Griesa ordered the firm to pay some $25,000 to the defendants for legal costs.
Mr. Beigel makes no apologies for the case, and its outcome tells a good deal about the firm's method of operation. Even before Judge Griesa's decision, Mr. Beigel said, the defendants had settled for a sizable sum.
ANOTHER case where the firm took it on the chin is Crigler v. Pennzoil. In that case, Texaco bondholders claimed they had been damaged by Pennzoil's pursuit of its $10 billion judgment against the oil company for interfering with Pennzoil's contract to purchase stock in Getty Oil. The judge in the case dismissed the bondholders' case, saying that the claimants were essentially trying to punish Pennzoil for pursuing its legal claims.
"Thus is born a new star in our rogues' gallery of frivolous lawsuits," wrote Judge Gerard L. Goettel of the Federal District Court in Manhattan. "This case is a bit of nonsense, a transparent petition for a license to mine in Pennzoil's deep pockets, and I will not allow it. Indeed, we feel compelled to return the favor, and allow the defendants to rummage a bit in the plaintiffs' pockets." Beigel & Sandler was ordered to pay Pennzoil's legal costs for this case.
Mr. Beigel thinks his clients had a decent claim. "If you are not going to bring a case you believe has merit because a judge might take a look at it and penalize you, then you are not being a good lawyer," he said.
Questions about the quality of the firm's legal work were also raised last May by Judge James B. Zagel of Federal District Court in Chicago.
In this class-action case, Williams v. Balcor Pension Investors, Beigel & Sandler argued that the prospectuses of a number of partnerships were misleading. But while the firm had named six plaintiffs to represent the investors, Judge Zagel ruled that none met the necessary standard, which says that the plaintiffs must be typical of the class they represent.
Three of the plaintiffs had never read the prospectus in question. Another, identified as a trustee for a trust that had invested in the partnerships, in fact no longer held that job, so had no right to sue. Some plaintiffs were included in the case before the firm even spoke with them.
"Beigel & Sandler's investigation of the proposed class representatives was woefully inadequate," Judge Zagel wrote, adding that the troubles showed the firm's "inadequacy as class counsel."
Mr. Beigel was undeterred, saying that the case is still going, with a new set of class representatives.
For all the criticism, Mr. Beigel shows no signs of slowing down. "In this business," he said, "you have to have a thick skin."
 
 
 
TRY, TRY AGAIN
 NO CLASS action involving limited partnerships has attracted more debate among lawyers and regulators than the 3-year-old case involving the Prudential Energy Income Funds, a series of oil partnerships. Small wonder: The financial fate of hundreds of thousands of investors who put $1.3 billion into the deals hangs on the outcome.
When the case was filed in 1990, little was known about the widespread fraud in the sale of limited partnerships that the Government now contends took place. Over two years, the class-action lawyers, led by Edward A. Grossmann, uncovered evidence of wrongdoing.
By last year, the team of lawyers, which included Beigel & Sandler, reached a settlement with Prudential that some lawyers criticized as paying only a few cents on the dollar. But Mr. Grossman argued that investors would be hard pressed to do better. "The terms of the settlement provide for fair and adequate compensation," he said last February.
The deal would have provided $37 million in cash, and rolled up the partnerships into a single publicly traded entity that would give stock to the partners. The lawyers could expect $7 million in fees, but as a sign of good faith, Mr. Grossmann asked that his fee be half in the new company's stock.
But in June, Judge Marcel Livaudais Jr. of Federal District Court in New Orleans, who is hearing the case, sided with critics. He said he had "serious reservations about the fairness of the proposed settlement."
About that time, bidders emerged for the partnerships. The winner, the Parker & Parsley Petroleum Company, paid investors $491 million.
By October, a new settlement had been struck for some $120 million in cash. Mr. Grossmann and the other lawyers again are arguing that this deal is fair, saying it gives investors the best of all worlds.
"Class members who want to participate are guaranteed of getting money, and in my opinion will get it faster" than through either arbitration or the fund established in Prudential's settlement with regulators, Mr. Grossman said. "But if they want to go another route, they can."
Others criticize the deal. "There is no justifiable reason why class-action plaintiffs should be treated like second-class citizens and receive only 15 percent of what they could in arbitration," said Stuart Goldberg, a lawyer in Austin with many Prudential cases.

HEADLINE: Crash Russian Course For Procter & Gamble

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN

DATELINE: MOSCOW

 BODY:
IN its brief but intense experience in the quirky Russian market, Procter & Gamble, the Cincinnati-based consumer products giant, has had to learn a few lessons.
Lesson No. 1: Shoppers need help learning about Western products. "I was in a store in Volgograd, and people kept coming up to me asking what this or that product actually does," said Peter Smit, who heads the company's Russian operations. "You have to put yourself in the shoes of the Russian consumer. She wants to be educated." 
 Lesson No. 2: Russians must be taught to make choices from a dizzying variety of goods. After 70 years of seeing stores stocked with whatever was available, not what consumers wanted, Russians are bewildered.
Take shampoo. Soviet shampoo did little more than wash hair, which was all shoppers needed to know -- assuming they even found it on the shelves. Now beauty-care counters in many urban stores are groaning with variety -- French, German and American; for damaged, oily or dry hair.
Procter & Gamble, which in January 1992 introduced Vidal Sassoon's Wash and Go, is doing its best to help shoppers cope with variety. Of nine Procter & Gamble products on the market, four come with instructions in Russian. (On the back of the Wash and Go bottle, it adds a helpful hint in Russian -- "wash hair and go.")
Lesson No. 3: Russians who have extra money are willing to spend it on quality. And a lot of them do have it. As Western companies move in, many find that people have more disposable income than official statistics would indicate.
Procter & Gamble is not alone in this classroom. In the last year, imported products -- from shampoos to pet food -- have poured into Moscow and St. Petersburg, which together have a population of 15 million. What started as a trickle of often bootlegged goods traded on a crazy jumble of street markets and sidewalk kiosks has moved into the shops, heralded by a steady patter of Western television commercials (with Russian voice-overs).
The recently established American Chamber of Commerce in Moscow estimates that 500 to 700 American companies are now doing business in Russia, compared with 100 a year ago.
True, the market is still small: according to Procter & Gamble's surveys, only 10 to 15 percent of the population can afford Western brands, which generally cost at least three times their Russian-made equivalents.
But the long lines at the beauty-care counter at Moscow's elegant Petrovsky arcade, with its attractive display of Western goods, show that there are buyers. Tatyana Petrova, 50, a retired flight attendant from the Siberian city of Krasnoyarsk, recently spent about 60,000 rubles -- $50, or two-thirds of an average Russian's monthly salary -- on a monthly shopping spree.
"I like pretty things, and I can afford them," said Mrs. Petrova, who has virtually written off Russian-made goods. Her shopping bag revealed a brand-consciousness that Western companies could only dream of a year ago. Lancome face powder and Orlane cream for herself, Oil of Olay moisturizer for her daughter, Colgate toothpaste for the family and Old Spice aftershave for her husband, an evidently successful businessman.
Other shoppers were more modest but no less committed to their choices. Natasha Geyorgyan, a teacher, had come to buy Pantene shampoo because a commercial said it was kind to damaged hair. Sofiya Pavlova, a retiree, was in line for Blend-a-Med toothpaste because of its pleasant taste and Camay soap for its nice smell. The prices, she admitted, were high -- 1,470 rubles for the toothpaste, 860 for the soap -- but, she said cheerfully, her son made a good salary.
"A year and a half ago, most companies doing business in Russia were industrial -- I.B.M., G.E. and the like," said Bruce Macdonald, chief Moscow representative for BBDO, the advertising agency. "Now they are mostly packaged-goods companies scrambling for their share of the market."
Why now? For one thing, the ruble, after holding steady for several months at about 1,200 to the dollar, is now effectively convertible, so companies can take local earnings and translate them into hard currencies without going through tortuous barter deals.
But other hurdles remain, like the Russian Government's recent announcement that on Jan. 1 it will impose higher import duties on a wide range of goods. Add this to the confused political situation, and many Western businesses still keep their distance.
"It is still early," said John E. Pepper, Procter & Gamble's president for international business, here on a short trip recently. He called the market a baby that's "alive and kicking but with a lot of growing up to do."
Procter & Gamble, with worldwide sales of $30.43 billion, began operations in St. Petersburg in August 1991; its first partner was Leningrad State University, which is involved in joint research projects and proved helpful in finding office space and providing introductions to bureaucrats.
A year after putting Wash and Go on the St. Petersburg market, Procter & Gamble moved on to Moscow with products like Tix and Ariel detergents, Camay soap, Head and Shoulders and Pantene Pro-V shampoos, Oil of Olay, Blend-a-med and Old Spice. The prices are steep by Russian standards -- 7,100 rubles for Oil of Olay day cream (nearly 8 percent of the average monthly salary) and 8,400 for Old Spice after-shave.
"At a certain point," Mr. Smit said, "we want to branch out" beyond the two cities. "But in a country like this, you have to go step by step."
The company crossed a threshold last month when it signed an agreement with a detergent-manufacturing plant in Novomoskovsk 130 miles south of Moscow; it has been producing Ariel detergent there since December 1992. Procter & Gamble will buy 14 percent of the company's shares and invest $50 million over five years, after which it will become the plant's majority owner.
Most marketing companies here are moving slowly toward local production. First you introduce your product, said Joseph F. Condon, a former RJR Nabisco executive who has set up his own consulting company in Moscow. Next you assemble it locally and then move to production. "Those are the normal stages of development," he said.
Like other consumer companies, Procter & Gamble keeps a tight lid on information about its Russian operations -- refusing, for instance, to reveal sales volumes or production figures.
"The volumes are very low for the size of the country, but we are about where we expected it to be," Mr. Pepper said. The challenge, he said diplomatically, is "price and affordability" -- how to reach a market where most people have little money.
"We are pricing as low as we can," he said.
Mr. Pepper made his first scouting trip here in 1990, when it was still the Soviet Union. "With all the challenges that remain, what has happened so far is miraculous," he said, with the caution of a man who has weathered his share of bureaucratic battles.
One surprise, he said, has been the diligence and eagerness of the young Russians hired to fill about 80 jobs here. Getting Westerners to join them remains a problem, however. "This is tough duty," he said, although he noted that there are always adventurers willing to take up the challenge.
The high cost of a Moscow operation is one reason it is still so difficult for companies to break even. "This is the most expensive city in Europe now," Mr. Macdonald said. "To put a $100,000 officer in Moscow will cost you $500,000," including housing, security and periodic trips out of the couuntry.
Distribution remains a nightmarish challenge. Procter & Gamble ships its products -- mostly from Europe -- by sea to St. Petersburg, a route that has spared it the tie-ups that now plague truck traffic on the border. But getting them from warehouse to stores is still a problem -- part of the "Big L," as Mr. Smit refers to his daily logistical headaches.
The confusion in Russian retailing -- where fly-by-night sidewalk kiosks still compete with state-owned stores -- is one of the most annoying aspects for foreign companies. The business has attracted both amateurs and con artists, and it is often hard to tell the difference.
But in some ways, approaching the Russian consumer has been easier than many companies expected. Brand recognition has not been a problem; Russians have always been acutely aware of foreign products, even when Western goods could be bought only from visitors, or on the black market.
"In those days, a Russian would never ask you to buy a video or a television," Mr. Macdonald said. "They would always ask for a Sony and give you the precise model number." The same applied to simpler products, from Marlboro cigarettes to Levi's jeans.
"Made in the West" remains a powerful lure for Russians, who remain suspicious of local brands and even of labels printed in the Cyrillic alphabet. Pepsi-Cola, which has bottled soft drinks here since Soviet times, now has to defend itself against the perception that it is somehow a local, with a low-quality product. Even Russian-produced Marlboros are proving a hard sell.
For Procter & Gamble, establishing brand recognition has not been any more difficult than anywhere else. Taking advantage of relatively cheap advertising rates (it costs 4 cents to reach a thousand viewers here, compared with $6 in the United States), it has kept up a steady television campaign.
BESIDES selling the products, the commercials offer viewers a glimpse of Western kitchens, clothes and life styles -- all of which contribute to the products' lure. Where the Russian market has shown its peculiarities is in the absence of brand loyalty among consumers, Mr. Smit noted. "If the product was on the shelf," he said, "then she bought it no matter how badly she needed it."
Now, even with more goods available, shoppers often go by their old instincts, snapping up what they see in case it disappears.
Some of the Russian consumer's special problems have been picked up in Procter & Gamble's ads, although most are repeats of commercials broadcast worldwide. But in a country where relatively few families have washing machines, commercials for detergents -- here as elsewhere, the company's best-selling products -- have to aim at women who wash clothes by hand, in buckets.
"You have to talk to them in a way that makes them see you understand their laundry problems," Mr. Smit said. "A Western consumer is trained to see commercials and will grasp the message. The Russian consumer needs extra words and images, not because she is dumb but because you have to show her how to use the product."

HEADLINE: GATT's Big Payoff for the U.S.

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
PROBABLY the most long-lasting benefit for the United States of the recently negotiated global trade pact isn't the most obvious, like being able to sell more beef to Europe and more supercomputers to Japan. Instead, it may be to encourage growth in many of the world's poor but aspiring nations. That -- contrary to the dire warnings of America's new isolationists like Pat Buchanan and Ross Perot -- would be good for most Americans, too, say most economists who focus on trade and growth.
"It's true that successful third world economies are competitors," said Paul Krugman, a trade economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "But they also become bigger markets for our products and they are also suppliers of better and cheaper products to our economy. Those benefits almost surely outweigh the adverse effects of increased competition." 
 Today, $4 of every $10 spent on jets, tractors, grain, movies and other American exports head for destinations outside of Canada, Japan and Europe, even though import barriers in much of Asia and Latin America are still as high as they used to be in the United States 40 years ago. What's more, even conservative growth forecasts suggest that the economies of less developed countries should grow two or three times as fast, on average, during the 1990's as those of the industrial nations.
"If 2 billion people get richer and smarter, will they buy more or less of our stuff?" David Rolley, an economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill who analyzes trade, asked rhetorically. "To ask the question is to answer it."
Briefly, the agreement reached last week under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade will trim tariffs on manufactured products in most countries by one-third, giving exporters a leg up, and will ease barriers against grain imports. More important for many developing countries, the new GATT rules would gradually eliminate quotas on textiles and clothing, which have artificially held down third world exports by tens of billions of dollars a year, and make it much harder for any country to impose new quantitative restrictions, like America's now-defunct quotas on steel imports.
Apart from the obvious -- that making it cheaper to export will increase poor countries' incomes -- there are at least three reasons for thinking that these seemingly pedestrian provisions could make it easier for many developing countries to prosper.
First, the adoption of the GATT accord keeps rich countries -- overwhelmingly the most important export market for poor ones -- committed to keeping their markets open at a time when Europe and Japan are suffering their worst economic setbacks since the Great Depression, a time when protectionism became rampant.
The beneficiaries are not the poorest of the poor but the semi-industrial countries: India, China (which is not yet a GATT member) and Mexico as well as countries on the Pacific Rim and in Latin America.
"MARKET access and growth in exports is worth much, much more than all the aid in the world put together," said Sherman Robinson, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley who is an expert on Latin America. "You generate foreign exchange. You buy capital goods and supplies. You get the technology. On the product side, you learn by exporting."
He added, "What these countries want now is to be part of the game."
Further, the GATT agreement commits lower-income countries, which until the 1980's were for the most part pursuing highly protectionist, inward-oriented growth strategies, to continue opening their markets.
"In a way, the developing countries have really signed onto a program that the O.E.C.D. countries bought into in the 1950's and 60's," said Professor Robinson, referring to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of more than 20 industrialized nations. "The O.E.C.D. countries did well with trade liberalization. There's no reason why these countries can't perform comparably."
FINALLY, trade is vital for growth and seems to benefit nations that open their economies even in the short run.
"Economists used to have a gut feeling that trade liberalization meant short-term loss and long-term gain," said Michael Bruno, chief economist at the World Bank. "But now studies show that even in the short run you can't find job losses in the countries that unilaterally lowered trade barriers."
What happens, he said, is that imports lower the cost of many goods, which in turn increases workers' real purchasing power. Increased competition rechannels workers from inefficient to efficient industries, making employment more profitable.
In the longer run, the intangible benefits loom very large indeed. A new school of development economics emphasizes that ideas -- imitation, invention, innovation -- rather than resources are the elixir of growth, and trade is a prime vehicle for acquiring new ideas. Besides, relying on exports tends to discourage governments from pursuing self-destructive economic policies like high inflation, and that is also good for growth.
But what makes prosperity in the third world good for the United States?
Exports, for one thing. In part, America's export performance has lately been better than Europe's or Japan's because this country's companies have a better foothold in fast-growing markets like Brazil and Indonesia.
"GATT will make these countries push liberalization forward," said Gary Hufbauer, an economist at the Institute for International Economics in Washington, noting that many countries from Mexico to Indonesia had lowered some of their trade barriers even before the GATT agreement. "Bigger hunks of our trade will be going to them."
A SECOND reason, one that no politician in these mercantilist times would admit, is imports.
"The worry I have is that the debate gets very mercantilist," said Professor Robinson at Berkeley. "Exports are supposed to be good and imports are supposed to be bad."
But as economists from Adam Smith onward have long recognized, the whole point of exporting is to be able to import -- just as the point of selling your labor is to be able to buy a doctor's services or groceries.
"If China expands production of toys or clothes, then that almost certainly raises America's real income because the United States is getting things cheaper," even though some American workers in the toy or clothing business may have to find new jobs, said Professor Krugman of M.I.T. "Plus China becomes a bigger market for U.S. airplanes and supercomputers."
More trade between the United States and the developing world should also increase opportunities for product specialization within many industries, as countries concentrate on products or components that they are best suited to make.
"The global specialization and division of labor is already happening," said Professor Robinson. "GATT facilitates this process by opening markets even further."
While some have argued that all manufacturing will move to low-wage countries -- the "giant sucking sound" Mr. Perot likes to talk about -- what has actually happened (between Germany and Spain, Japan and Malaysia and the United States and Mexico) is a growing specialization and an explosion of two-way trade in industries like cars and computers that has helped reinvigorate American industry.
"It's Adam Smith with a vengeance," Professor Robinson said.

ECONOMY
 
Believe It or Not, a GATT Agreement (With Some Holes)
When seven years of world trade talks ended last week -- on schedule! -- it was really a bow to the inevitable. For even as political flash fires flare worldwide, the business world is rapidly making borders irrelevant -- a reality negotiators recognized in cutting many tariffs and moving toward ending subsidies. The goal was clear: raise everyone's living standards. And the cheers were equally clear. "The world has chosen openness and cooperation," said Peter Sutherland, GATT's director general. There was also a sense that in the deadline dash, negotiators lopped off anything sticky -- like a late spat over European limits on American movies -- to deal with another day. President Clinton met his "fast track" goal, however -- Congress must vote "yes" or "no," not amend the pact to death. A comment by France's Foreign Minister, Alain Juppe, best captures the mood: "I never want to hear the word GATT again." 

Wisconsin Takes On Welfare
Wisconsin agrees on one thing: welfare needs an overhaul. What it can't agree on is a solution. Sounds familiar. Wisconsin, though, wants to probe this frontier. Last week, Gov. Tommy G. Thompson signed a law pledging, by 1999, to replace Federal welfare with a state plan. But all is not unity. Mr. Thompson, a Republican, has a time-worn formula: give business hiring incentives. Democrats have their own time-worn formula: create public-service jobs. Not an original idea in sight. But given the sorry state of the current system -- "a jailer of people," one Democrat called it -- Mr. Thompson has a point when he says, "The best thing to do is to start over fresh."
 
A November Spending Spree
People must really think the economy's out of the woods, because even last month, when shopping could easily be put off, they spent up a storm. The Commerce Department said last week that November retail sales rose 0.4 percent, a solid eighth straight rise. Americans spent nearly $180 billion, or about $700 for every woman, man and child. (Did they need that stuff? Don't ask.) And they're looking to the future, too: sales of durable goods provided the power, rising 0.9 percent. ("Durable" goods, by the way, are those meant to last three years.)
 
A Lucite Hyena! How Lovely!
You unwrap the package with trepidation, struggling to keep that joyful smile on your face, and there it is, the gift from hell -- the after-shave (you have a beard), the turtleneck (you loathe turtlenecks), the book you'll never read (but will take up shelf space till the statute of obligations runs out), the demitasse cups (does anyone use these?). What a waste, you sigh, and move glumly to the next gift. But this is an age when even sighs must be counted, so it's no surprise that one economist has put a dollar figure on that waste. In The American Economic Review, Joel Waldfogel, of Yale, estimates that of $40 billion spent annually on gifts, $4 billion, possibly even $10 billion or so, is a "deadweight loss" -- the difference between what the giver spends and the value the recipient puts on the gift. Like all Scrooges, though, he'll get his. Now, as he readily admits, "I'm afraid I may not get as many gifts."
 
Annenberg 'Bomb' for Schools
"I felt I had to drop a bomb on the situation," Walter Annenberg said. An apt image, for what spurred him to action last week was the growing violence in schools -- "so many youngsters," he lamented, "with knives and revolvers." And Mr. Annenberg, who at 85 has made billions in publishing ventures like TV Guide, can afford one heck of a "bomb." He's giving $500 million to groups involved in school reform, the largest single gift ever to public education.
 
Going Without Health Insurance
Lest anyone dream that the health care crisis will ease on its own, Government data showed last week that it's only getting worse. In 1992, the report said, the number of people without health insurance hit 38.9 million, up 2.3 million from 1991 -- a rise greater than in the two previous years combined. Not surprisingly, half the people making less than $10,000 lack coverage. But the problem is not just at small companies and among the unemployed -- the major trouble spots. Fully 19 percent of the uninsured are in the families of those who work for companies with more than 1,000 workers. No one is safe from this epidemic.
 
COMPANIES
 
A Bit Less Bloody at Toys 'R' Us
Hooded vampires stalk scantily clad sorority girls. If they catch them, they drill into their necks and drain their blood. Only the wide-eyed child at the controls can stop them. Wholesome stuff, right? Some people think so. Tom Zito, head of Digital Pictures, which makes the Sega game called Night Trap, says it's "actually very benign and is designed as a parody of a vampire movie." Yes, one can just hear some scholarly 10-year-old: "Awesome parody, dude!" But if kids aren't scared, retailers are (because, perhaps, the Senate is even now pondering curbs on video game violence?). Last week Toys 'R' Us stopped selling Night Trap, and F.A.O. Schwarz followed suit. "I'm thrilled," said Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, a crusader against violent games. "This will help parents raise their children and not leave it to the video-game industry."
 
Con Ed Indicted for Blast
After a 1989 steam-pipe explosion in Manhattan, the Government says, Con Edison did not let on for four days that the blast had spewed out 200 pounds of asbestos. Last week Con Ed and two of its retired officials were indicted on charges of concealing that knowledge.
 
Mixed Signals on Shawmut
Washington didn't quite get its signals straight on Shawmut National. Just last month the Federal Reserve, citing lending bias, blocked a planned acquisition by Shawmut, New England's No. 3 banking company. But last week, when the Justice Department settled its bias case against the bank, Attorney General Janet Reno went out of her way to praise the corrective steps Shawmut took months ago. Shawmut, though denying any bias, agreed to pay $10,000 to $15,000 to any black or Hispanic customer who could show possible discrimination. But the Justice Department said the violations were from 1990 to 1992. Was the Fed a latecomer?
 
Lucky Stores Comes a Long Way
Diane Skillsky has been at Lucky Stores in California for 21 years, at one point working at a cash register next to her teen-age son. Her son was offered a shot at a better job; she wasn't. She, and a lot of others, refused to take it anymore. In a decade-long sex-discrimination battle, Lucky insisted that women weren't promoted because they didn't want better jobs. (Just as the homeless like it on the street.) But last week Lucky agreed to pay $75 million in damages to 14,000 women and to invest $20 million in affirmative action, one of the largest sex-bias settlements ever. Said Ms. Skillsky: "This is a great day." And you can bet the rest of the grocery industry was watching very, very closely.
 
At Kodak, No Quick Fixes
Wall Street often thinks that one mere mortal can instantly reverse a corporate giant's fortunes. Sometimes it gets a rude reminder of its naivete. In October, when Eastman Kodak named George M. C. Fisher as chairman, replacing Kay R. Whitmore, who'd been criticized for being too timid a cost-cutter, Kodak stock shot up. But last week, Mr. Fisher said, in effect, "Wait a second, folks, it's not that easy." Forget record earnings next year, he said, "it looks more challenging." And, going right to that sacred issue, he added, "Cost-cutting alone is not the long-term answer." That did it. End of honeymoon. The shares plunged to Whitmore levels and below, losing $7.25 in a day, ending the week at $55.25.
 
United's Unions Try Again
United Airlines' unions made yet another stab at buying control of the airline last week, in a complex deal that includes concessions on wages and work rules. But investors were wary: even though the deal is valued at $173 a share, the stock fell to $143.375 by week's end.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
At Ford, Trade Pact Means Jobs
Backers of the North American Free Trade Agreement must have applauded. They'd said all along that the accord would mean more American jobs, not fewer, and last week some corroborating evidence bubbled out of the economy's laboratory: Ford said it would build its new compact cars in both Mexico and the United States and greatly increase exports to Mexico. The rejiggering of its operations, it said, will create 550 jobs in the United States and Canada and 300 in Mexico. One swallow does not make the case, though; this week some company may well slash payrolls, pinning the blame on the trade accord.
 
German Engineering Meets U.S. Accounting
Daimler-Benz badly wants to expand its horizons beyond a recession-battered Germany, but it's discovering that each step has a price. Planning to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange soon, it agreed to report its earnings the American way, stricter than the German method that allows moving funds in and out of reserves. But at the moment of truth, that fine point led to two starkly different numbers. Daimler said last week that in the first nine months of 1993 it lost $105 million -- but that ballooned to $1.19 billion under American accounting. True, Mercedes sales have improved, and it has plans for a new Alabama plant. But with that new number, one wonders if American investors will see the shares as quite so desirable.
 
Japan's Trade Surplus Slips
It took a while, but it's happening. The pricey yen is finally putting a dent in Japan's trade surplus, which has made Japan highly unpopular the world over. Last week, Tokyo reported that the surplus fell 2.2 percent in November from the year-earlier figure, the first such decline in nearly three years.

HEADLINE: World Markets;
Westerners in Russia's Rough Weather

BYLINE: By Richard W. Stevenson

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
IMAGINE trying to launch a Russian investment fund last week. That was the unenviable task facing the Framlington Group, a London-based fund manager that had spent a year setting up a plan to attract Western capital and invest it in small and medium-sized Russian enterprises.
Yet despite the political chaos that engulfed Moscow in the wake of last weekend's parliamentary elections, Framlington's launch went smoothly. Along with two government-funded international agencies -- the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank's International Finance Corporation -- a hardy band of institutional investors, mostly from Britain, Europe and America, pledged more than $60 million to the fund, exceeding Framlington's $50 million goal. 
 "We've seen political crises come and go, and it has not affected underlying business opportunities in Russia," said Connell Gallagher, an investment analyst at Framlington. Mr. Gallagher, however, was one of the few analysts in Europe with nice things to say about Russia.
The strong showing of the ultra-nationalist Liberal Democratic party led by Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky sent shudders through European markets. Nowhere were the fears more apparent than in Frankfurt, where the DAX index fell sharply on Tuesday after Mr. Zhirinovsky was quoted as saying that he would not hesitate to use nuclear force against Germany.
Analysts said the nervousness about Russia was a factor in erratic performances in Paris, London and other European financial markets as well.
"The bond markets must hope that Yeltsin continues to outwit the growing threat to his position," said a report from Natwest Markets in London, referring to Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin.
The jitters were to some extent the usual first reaction of investors to political uncertainty in any big country. Some analysts, however, said the Russia factor could prove to be much more than a short-term phenomenon in the markets. In their view, the elections could cause political and military shifts with profound effects on foreign policy and on the economies of Russia and the West.
"The front-line Western European stock markets will be gradually hit over a long period as uncertainty in Russia rises," said David C. Roche, the global strategist at Morgan Stanley in London. "Remember, this is a creeping social cancer, not a coup."
Mr. Roche said that markets in Germany, Austria and Finland would be most vulnerable because of geography and politics, and because they are near record highs.
But he added that any major shift to the right in Russian foreign and domestic policy could spark responses in the West that would be felt far more broadly throughout the European markets. If the decline in military spending in the West has to be reversed, for example, many of the economic and budgetary assumptions underpinning investment decisions would have to be thrown out.
"It's going to affect all kinds of things in the West, and the West hasn't even begun to think about it yet," Mr. Roche said.
The results of the Russian elections were digested by the European markets during a week in which investors had plenty on which to chew.
There was the final deal on liberalizing world trade, widely viewed as a plus for the economies of Western Europe. Germany's Bundesbank said it saw inflation weakening, suggesting that it would continue to cut interest rates, but said it would adopt stricter targets for money-supply growth.
A sharp fall in unemployment in Britain heartened investors who have been looking for evidence that their faith in the British recovery was not misplaced. In London, the Financial Times-Stock Exchange index of 100 leading shares closed Friday at an all-time high of 3,337.1, up 75.8 points for the week, reflecting both the improved outlook for corporate earnings among British companies and the prospect of further interest-rate cuts.
In Frankfurt, the DAX index closed at 2,151.02 on Friday, down just over 10 points for the week. The CAC-40 in Paris closed at 2,196.44 on Friday, down 1.7 points for the week.
The markets gave hardly any notice to the trade deal completed under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. "Everyone expected GATT to pass, and it was fully priced into the market," Mr. Roche said. "The Russian thing is not in the market, and so far people want to ignore it."
Investors within Russia were clearly nervous about the prospects for continued progress toward a free-market system. There was a drop of nearly 20 percent in the price of Russia's only widely traded security, the vouchers used to purchase shares in businesses that are being privatized.
Despite having $60 million on the line, Mr. Gallagher of Framlington, the fund manager, was more sanguine. President Yeltsin, he said, had proved himself repeatedly to be an economic reformer, and with the nation having granted him enhanced powers under the new constitution approved in the vote last weekend, the Russian leader would have the chance to keep the nation heading down the road to capitalism.
"There's a huge lack of capital in Russia, and there's almost no long-term financing, but there's a lot being sold," said Mr. Gallagher, who said the fund would concentrate on investments in companies that have joint ventures with Western partners.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
New Future for Dreyfus Investors

BYLINE: By Leslie Wayne

 BODY:
FOR Howard Stein, the chairman of the Dreyfus Corporation, the union of his company with Mellon Bank is more a realization of a long-held vision of a new world for investors than just a dollars-and-cents transaction.
His vision is that banks and mutual funds will eventually combine to create a new breed of financial institution that will provide a broader array of products than either institution can provide on its own. This reflects his fundamental belief that bank savers, who are now fleeing bank deposit accounts because of low interest rates, are never going to return once they've tasted the more exciting -- and potentially more financially rewarding -- world of investing. 
 "For a long time, I've felt that a new financial service institution was going to come into being," Mr. Stein said in an interview in his expansive and modern midtown Manhattan office just a few days after the Dreyfus-Mellon arrangement was announced on Dec. 6. The merger would create one of the largest pools of assets under management -- $84.4 billion, an amount in the same league with financial powerhouses like the California Public Employees Retirement System, Fidelity Investments and the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association-College Retirement Fund.
"As we see bank savers becoming investors, they will not go back to being passbook savers when interest rates rise," said Mr. Stein, who is 67 years old and has headed Dreyfus since 1970. "The investment side of banks will completely and totally overshadow the savings side, and savings will become like the buggy whip. This is an inevitable change."
For Dreyfus's existing customers in its 125 funds, any changes from the merger will not be apparent for a while. But by the end of the summer, Dreyfus and Mellon will have a new computer system to provide investment advice, something Dreyfus does not now do, and more offerings. These offerings will not be new funds but services now offered by Mellon's century-old trust department.
"This is not going to be two institutions just cross-selling products," Mr. Stein said. "It will be a new way of serving people on all segments of their financial needs in one place for their entire lives."
He specifically plans to have Dreyfus work closely with Mellon's trust department to provide a cradle-to-grave set of products and services that Dreyfus does not offer on its own, including legal and estate planning. "You know Toys 'R' Us?" Mr. Stein said. "This will be Financial Services 'R' Us. All financial services in one system at a reasonable price."
Behind this strategy are some telling numbers. According to Mr. Stein, nearly 80 percent of Dreyfus's 900,000 customers have only about 20 percent of their assets with Dreyfus. Because of this, Mr. Stein said the purpose of the union with Mellon was not to get new client names but to further penetrate Dreyfus's existing client base.
"We want to be involved with personal-wealth building," Mr. Stein said. "We needed to be associated with a bank trust department to do that. We're not interested in selling a product in a bank lobby."
His vehicle for doing this is a computerized "superstation" that will be available to Dreyfus staff by the end of the summer to provide detailed investment and demographic information about clients.
"We will be able to give advice on which mutual fund to buy," Mr. Stein said. "If you have to deal with issues of wills or 401K planning, it will advise you what investments are most appropriate for you. It will be a total management program for people from the beginning of their investing lives through retirement. This is the perfect system to be used in association with a bank trust department."
Mr. Stein, who will become the largest shareholder in Mellon with shares valued at nearly $60 million, believes that other banks that want to expand into mutual funds do not necessarily have to run out and buy a fund company. Rather, he feels they can build on their existing trust departments. This may be a slower process than an acquisition. But, Mr. Stein said, it is an alternative many banks have overlooked.
"Banks already have an asset in their system, and the question is how to make that asset work for them," he said. "They have to learn how to sell that as a service instead of offering a product here and there. Banks can use the asset of their trust department and don't have to go through all the complications of a merger. Mellon's service ability and trust department was what this merger was all about."
Mr. Stein said he was so intrigued by the notion of bank-mutual fund combinations that he bought a bank several years ago -- one with less than $40 million in assets -- to learn how banks work. The bank, the Dreyfus Security Savings Bank, based in Paramus, N.J., has a mortgage banking operation and had a credit card operation that was sold.
"I wanted to learn about the banking business because I had a feeling they would come together," Mr. Stein said. "Now I see that as inevitable. And now that Mellon and Dreyfus are together, I think we're in advance of other institutions."

HEADLINE: NEEDIEST CASES;
Mother of Two Finds Material and Emotional Support

BYLINE: By Abby Goodnough

 BODY:
On the first bitter-cold night of December, Gail Adams roasts a chicken and digs out a dusty box of Christmas ornaments. A scraggly fir tree is propped up on the porch of her tiny white house, waiting to be decorated. Her children, Jessica and Ryan, dance dizzily around the tree as she prepares supper.
For Mrs. Adams, life is rarely this good. 
 Since she left her husband and moved from Long Island to Staten Island in 1990, she has lost three secretarial jobs because of the recession. She was injured in a car accident last May, and her old station wagon died a few months later. Her son, barely out of diapers, has been hospitalized three times for various illnesses.
The worst moment came on a chilly spring night last year when she tried to withdraw $20 from a bank machine and found she had a negative balance. That night, she learned that creditors had been authorized to take $2,500 from her account.
"I didn't even have money to buy diapers and milk," Mrs. Adams, 33, said in a quavery voice, brushing wisps of blond hair from her pale face. "I had to borrow from the neighbors. I couldn't think straight."
 
'I Wouldn't Have Made It'
 The next day, a friend told her to call Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York. But Mrs. Adams, who enjoyed a life of privilege as a child, was reluctant to pick up the phone.
"I've always been very independent, and I'm ashamed to ask for favors," she said. "But I wouldn't have made it through the week if I hadn't made that call."
Mrs. Adams is still incredulous that Catholic Charities gave her several boxes of food, $150 worth of vouchers for grocery shopping and $25 in cash. She kept in touch with case workers at the agency's Staten Island unit, and last Christmas they supplied her with an enormous holiday dinner and gifts for Jessica and Ryan.
"They brought two different kinds of pie and they even remembered whipped cream to put on top," she laughed. "If it wasn't for them, we wouldn't have had a Santa Claus."
Catholic Charities is one of seven agencies supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which is conducting its 82d annual appeal for donations. All contributions go directly to the charities because The Times pays for the fund's expenses. This year's Neediest Cases appeal will end on Feb. 28.
 
Emotional Support
 Since Catholic Charities began helping Mrs. Adams, she said, she no longer has anxiety attacks or crying jags. She calls regularly to chat with caseworkers, and she has even donated several boxes of baby clothes to the agency.
"Whenever things get bad, they give me emotional support," she said. "They have been good friends."
As she slices an apple for her children, Mrs. Adams admits her life is far different from the one she planned for herself as a girl. The first book she read was a biography of Oliver Wendell Holmes, and she wanted to be a lawyer. She attended a Manhattan prep school and a four-year college in Boston where she received a degree in English. But since then, she has had two failed marriages and finds herself dogged from job to job by layoffs.
"My grandmother lived on Park Avenue and I spent my summers in Westhampton Beach," she said, her voice trailing off. "Look where it got me."
 
Barely Covering Expenses
 These days Mrs. Adams has a temporary job as an administrative assistant at a Manhattan real-estate development company. To get to work by 9 A.M., she must leave the house by 7, and she often does not return until after 7 P.M. She does not dare take a day off to stand in line and recertify for food stamps, she said, for fear that she would be dismissed.
Mrs. Adams loathes the long trips to and from work, which keep her from spending more time with her children. And her salary barely covers her expenses, which include $200 a week for baby sitters. But she said she would much rather have a low-paying job than collect welfare, which she did once before. If she were on welfare she would not be able to pay $575 a month for the four-room bungalow she has grown to love.
"When I lived in an apartment, the neighbors would treat me like dirt because I didn't have a husband," she said bitterly. "But this house is all mine, and nobody can tell me what to do. I come home every night and feel totally safe."
 
A Lonely Existence
 But Mrs. Adams also feels lonely. Both her parents are dead, and she has no siblings. Since she does not have a car, she leaves the house on weekends only to do laundry and buy groceries. She has not been to a movie theater in five years, and her last vacation was in 1985. More than anything, she said, she would like to go to church regularly.
"I've always wanted to go to midnight Mass on Christmas Eve," she said. "But there's nobody to stay with the kids, so I sit at home and watch television."
If she is offered a permanent job at the real-estate company, Mrs. Adams said, she will be able to save for a new car. Maybe she will have the money to send Ryan to nursery school.
Meanwhile there is a chicken in the oven and a Christmas tree to decorate. And there are Jessica and Ryan, who chase each other through the cramped rooms and brighten her mood with their giggles.
"Things might be easier without the kids, but everyone has to make sacrifices," she said. "Without them, I would have nothing."

HEADLINE: Inequity of Lobbying Deduction

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "Congress's Wrong Turn on Lobbying" (Viewpoints, Nov. 28), Donald B. Susswein argues that the 1993 tax law's denial of Federal tax deductions for business lobbying expenses is not appropriate. However, he overlooks the similar penalty the tax code imposes on some forms of individual lobbying. 
 Of course, some benefits of individual lobbying, like increased civil liberties, are not subject to Federal income tax. But other individual lobbying can produce benefits that are reflected in higher taxable income.
Individuals can lobby for policies that would allow increased capital formation, foster job retraining, establish fair-hiring practices, bolster labor laws and trade protection and set higher minimum wages. Individuals can also press for measures that would increase the return on their taxable investments or reduce their state and local income and property taxes.
Since individuals are penalized because they are not allowed to deduct the costs of such lobbying while they must pay taxes on the associated benefits, it is unclear whether the 1993 tax law's imposition of a similar penalty on business lobbying is a step toward or away from a level playing field.

HEADLINE: Professional Pay Disparity

 BODY:
To the Editor:
As the world turns away from the failed policies of managed economics, Derek Bok is advocating a return to the form of income controls that were integral to theoretical Communism. 
 Instead of advocating managing the incomes of those who are contributing to the creation of national wealth (business professionals) or those who have spent unending time and money becoming proficient in the medical or legal professions, why doesn't Mr. Bok comment on the excesses in the entertainment and sports industries?
And if Mr. Bok complains about the impoverishment in the educational field, he has only to relate its incomes to the hours of production to see that education's salary rates (plus the extravagant benefits) are on average probably among the highest.

HEADLINE: Yeltsin Marches Russia Toward Dictatorship;
Governing Better

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Marshall I. Goldman offers poor advice to Boris N. Yeltsin in "Yeltsin Needs a Fresh Mandate" (Op-Ed, Dec. 14) because, like many Western observers, he arranges the Russian context according to his own understanding of democracy. 
 Americans have no problem distinguishing political legitimacy from political competence. Elect a bunch of bums, and they are your bums until their terms expire, however badly they perform. If competence had anything to do with legitimacy in our system, we might be electing new officials every two weeks.
What sanctioned the czar was divine ordination. What sanctioned the Communist Party was the promise to overtake and outstrip the capitalist societies of the West, and the application of force when that promise proved idle. In simplest terms, the Soviet system dissolved mostly because it was not working well enough and because, in the end, no amount of force could have made it do better.
No new referendum will legitimize Mr. Yeltsin's regime in most Russian eyes, only an improvement in performance. As was abundantly clear to many of us who were in Moscow at the time, the October Days were a political and moral disaster because the regime handled the crisis so badly. The new parliament will be equally oppositional until Mr. Yeltsin's Government is legitimized by broad perceptions of social and economic betterment and a modicum of political stability, whatever its legal cover. A new referendum could bring chaos.
The regime needs to govern better. This requires taking into full account the vital forces of the country, fully revealed through the elections, and a better way than confrontation to diffuse those whose potential is destructive.

HEADLINE: NEEDIEST CASES;
Remaining Hopeful Despite Troubles

 BODY:
Mary Sullivan awoke in a hospital bed, unaware that she had spent eight days on a respirator, unwilling to believe that a persistent cough had become pneumonia, and that the treatment had left her too weak to walk.
When the doctors explained that muscle relaxants she received during her treatment had caused her muscles to atrophy, she faced down her fear. She vowed to fight for her life and struggled through weeks of physical therapy, straining to breathe as she did leg lifts to regain her strength. 
 A devout Roman Catholic, she accepted six weeks in the hospital stoically. But when she was released 13 months ago and learned that the damage to her lungs had ended her working life, Ms. Sullivan broke down and wept.
"I always had work to look forward to," she said last week, sobbing briefly as she recalled being laid off from her job as office manager for a doctor in Brooklyn Heights. She had never married, and work, like the Church, had been a social focus of her life ever since she finished high school and took her first job as a secretary.
Although Ms. Sullivan misses most the social contacts and the feeling of usefulness that she found on the job, sudden unemployment brought financial hardship as well. Her savings disappeared quickly, and when her disability payments were delayed in a paperwork snarl last March, she found herself unable to pay for her medication or cover her electric bill.
 
'Falling Through the Cracks'
 Catholic Charities for the Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens covered the $150 shortfall with money raised by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, perhaps saving her from applying for public assistance. The agency is one of seven supported by the Neediest Cases Fund, which is now conducting its 82d annual campaign.
"It's amazing how little it takes to keep people from falling through the cracks," said Margaret Keavenig, a social worker at Catholic Charities. "We like to use the Times money as a bridge for people who are in crises. Long-term support is less and less the focus of our social service agency."
Ms. Sullivan's plight was typical for working people who benefit from the Neediest Cases Fund, Ms. Keavenig said. After the disability paperwork went through, Ms. Sullivan needed no further help. She was able to keep her rent-stabilized Park Slope apartment and cover her $100 monthly medication bill on the $700 disability pension.
"I have hope," said Ms. Sullivan, who is now 60 years old. "But it's hard living on the edge. If anything goes wrong, I don't know what I will do."
Ms. Sullivan has little money for even the smallest of luxuries, but her energy and enthusiasm for work are returning. She walked several blocks to a nearby restaurant to eat lunch with visitors last week, and spoke eagerly about her search for volunteer work in her neighborhood.
"There must be something I can do," she said. "I can't stay home and watch the talk shows."

Renewal Plan Moves Ahead

BYLINE: By LYNETTE HOLLOWAY

 BODY:
Ground breaking is scheduled to begin next spring on an ambitious plan to restore one of the city's most impoverished areas -- 28 blocks in the northwestern portion of Ocean Hill-Brownsville and the southeastern portion of Bedford-Stuyvesant.
As part of the Saratoga Square plan, the city this month sent out requests for proposals to nonprofit community agencies for the marketing of 1,200 housing units -- a mixture of new two-family houses and renovated apartment buildings. The plan also calls for the creation of park areas and for new commercial development. 
 Saratoga Square is bounded roughly by Atlantic Avenue and Bainbridge Street and Ralph and Rockaway Avenues. It is the city's second largest neighborhood-renewal project, exeeded only by Harlem's 40-block Bradhurst redevelopment plan.
The Brooklyn plan includes the construction of about 400 two-family homes and the substantial rehabilitation of 80 abandoned, city-owned apartment buildings. In addition, it calls for the moderate rehabilitation of 30 occupied buildings.
This spring, construction is scheduled to begin on 63 of the two-family homes. Construction will be paid for by New York City ($10,000 per unit), New York State's Affordable Housing Program ($15,000 per unit) and the Borough of Brooklyn ($15,000 per unit).
In other aspects of the program, the city's Economic Development Corporation will market sites for commercial development along Fulton Street,two parks will be enlarged and two open-space sites will be developed in the vicinity of Somers and Fulton Streets. L.H.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: HARLEM;
Compendium Aims to Keep Local Money Local

BYLINE: By EMILY M. BERNSTEIN

 BODY:
The latest chapter in the Greater Harlem Chamber of Commerce's effort to sell Harlem's wares is a spiral-bound guide in red, purple and green, called "Harlem Means Business."
Its 80 pages cover everything from the history of Harlem to an overview of the community's major assets to a listing of businesses, including 10 art galleries, 30 funeral homes and one medical supply store. 
 "Our office is flooded by requests for companies that can do work, particularly in the housing development field and the construction field," said Lloyd Williams, the president of the chamber. The guide lists 33 companies that fit the description.
"The need has been there for a long time," Mr. Williams said, "but the demand is greater than ever."
The guide is being produced with the help of a grant from Citibank, which has recently begun a number of outreach programs in Harlem, as have other banks during the increasing move to develop the area over the last five years. Chamber officials say it is the first general guide produced in more than 40 years.
Twenty thousand copies of the book, which covers the chamber's service area from 90th to 168th Street, will be distributed to local businesses, community organizations, libraries and churches beginning in mid-January.
It will also be available in Citibank branches all over the city. E.M.B.

HEADLINE: NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: RICHMOND HILL/OZONE PARK;
Do Giant Stores Kill Small Shops? Survey Says No

BYLINE: By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ

 BODY:
How does the arrival of a retailing giant affect a neighborhood?
Here in Ozone Park, while some residents, merchants and civic leaders continue to try to halt construction of a Home Depot store at Aqueduct Race Track, partly out of a desire to protect smaller businesses, a recent city survey of a local 75,000-square-foot shopping center confirms a conclusion reached by some other residents: large retail chains do not necessarily discourage mom-and-pop-sized shops. 
 The survey, which was conducted by the Department of City Planning, indicates that the seven-year-old Clocktower Plaza shopping center on Atlantic Avenue, anchored by a 55,000 square-foot Pathmark supermarket, has not disrupted the stability of neighborhood retail strips.
Some of those who once opposed the center now say that it has provided new jobs, as well as greater choice for consumers -- a position supported by city planners and other officials who are trying to lure more large retail chains like Home Depot and Kmart into the city.
Simcha Waisman, the head of a block association that once bitterly opposed the shopping center, says that because the Pathmark center has not created the anticipated problems, but rather forced local businesses to be more responsive to the needs of customers, his group is supporting the Home Depot project.
"We feel the Home Depot will be an asset to our community," said Mr. Waisman, who heads the Richmond Hill Block Association.
The survey compared the number of small shops and other stores that existed before and after the Pathmark center opened in 1986, finding that the numbers were virtually the same between 1983 and 1993. City planners conducted a similar survey in Borough Park, Brooklyn, where another Pathmark shopping center opened in 1988, and reached the same conclusion.
Earlier this month, the city's Board of Standards and Appeals concluded hearings on the Home Depot project amid accusations that the giant retailer had not undergone the appropriate environmental, zoning and legal reviews before receiving a building permit -- a charge city and company officials deny.
The board is expected to make a ruling next month on the debate, which reflects the opposition that major retailers have faced as they slowly begin to move into the city.
Brian J. Herman, the president of the Coalition for Community Preservation and Stabilization, questioned the value of the recent survey, noting that the Home Depot project is about double the size of the Pathmark center and thus poses a greater economic and environmental threat to the area.
City planners acknowledge that there is a difference between the projects, but note that the concerns that arose seven years ago recalled those of today.
Mr. Herman, however, remains adamant. "The price of a Home Depot is a loss of businesses and a destabilization of a residential community," he said. R.H.

HEADLINE: EVERGLADES CLASH THREATENS ACCORD

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 18

 BODY:
An agreement between farmers and government to help restore the endangered Everglades ecosystem fell apart this week because the two sides could not reconcile their visions of the region's future.
The conflict mirrors the clash of values in forestry, mining and other industries as the Clinton Administration seeks to turn away from piecemeal natural resource management to restoration of whole ecosystems. The idea is to negotiate broad agreements with local interests based on mutual advantages, but as the collapse of the Florida agreement shows, accord can be difficult when economic interests and the environment collide. 
 In the Everglades, it now appears that the promising but narrow agreement to clean up the phosphorous-laden water discharged from sugar and vegetable farms will have to go back to court.
The two sides had made substantial progress in court-ordered negotiations, even announcing an agreement in principle last July. But on Thursday, the negotiations over the details reached an impasse.
 
Farmers Sought Guarantee
 Growers of sugar cane and vegetables have prospered in a vast swath of farmland claimed from what was, a century ago, the upper reaches of an uninterrupted flow of water creeping southward through grassy marshes from Lake Okeechobee to the Florida Bay. The growers, in the past five months of negotiations, had agreed to take some land out of production but had sought guarantees against losing even more land later.
At Florida's tip lies the Everglades National Park, untouched by development but hardly undamaged by more than 50 years of development around its periphery. The Government is committed to preserving this wilderness.
In an interview on Friday, George Frampton, the Assistant Secretary of Interior who led Federal negotiating, said he would spend the next few weeks coming up with a strategy for the fight ahead. He said he assumed that negotiations would not resume, because in his view the guarantee the growers were demanding was too high a price.
Mr. Frampton said the farmers would have to face the changes that would result from economic and ecological trends in Florida. "That does not mean that agriculture will go out of business, or be less profitable in the future," he said. "But the amount of cane sugar is going to be less. It may be 10 percent, or 20 percent, or 75 percent, or 28 percent less in 20 to 25 years."
 
Going Beyond the Accord

Those figures would go far beyond the agreement in principle, which had contemplated transforming 40,000 acres of farmland into filtration marshes that would have helped remove the phosphorus from the agricultural runoff over 20 years, at an estimated cost of $465 million to growers.
The plan would have provided the farmers with financial incentives to help reduce the pollution, which they could do with new plant varieties, new fertilization techniques and new water pumping practices that the industry is already testing.
Growers also wanted protection from a proposed state tax on sugar to pay for environmental restoration and help with problems with obtaining water permits.
The Government wanted a relatively quick fix to the pollution problem, but over the longer term it wanted a free hand to design a management plan for the whole ecosystem, one that might sacrifice more farmland if necessary.
 
Study Outlines Vision
 The longer-term vision came abruptly into public view this fall when the Government sought public comment on a study that talked about a wholesale reversal of how the state had treated its watery regions for decades.
The study was cited by the growers as a sign that the Interior Department had been bargaining in bad faith over the narrower water cleanup.
The Government scientists contended that on the farmland, drained by thousands of miles of ditches and canals, the mucky topsoil was deteriorating so badly that farming would eventually become virtually impossible.
The study, which raised the possibility of flooding hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland, prompted an outcry in farming communities where the public was invited to comment on it this week.
"I don't think you are willing to die to take my farm," one farmer told Federal officials on Tuesday at a hearing in Clewiston, on the shore of Okeechobee. "But I'm willing to die to keep it."
And J. Nelson Fairbanks, the president of the United States Sugar Corporation, the dominant grower in the negotiations, said the study indicated the Government had acted in bad faith in reaching the accord.
Government officials said the farmers were exaggerating the threat. Environmental groups accused growers of using the negotiations as a stalling tactic and using the report as a monkey wrench in the gears of the negotiations.
"They were looking to walk away from the negotiations, and they found a pretext," said Thomas Martin, director of the Everglades campaign at the National Audubon Society.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 21, 1993, Tuesday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about efforts to restore water quality in the Everglades rendered a percentage incorrectly in a quotation from George Frampton, an assistant Secretary of Interior, about a decline in sugar production that might result from these efforts. In suggesting that any decline could not be predicted precisely, he said, "It might be 10 percent, or 20 percent, or 25 percent, or 28 percent less in 20 to 25 years." He did not use a 75 percent figure.

Selling History on the Lower East Side

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
ORCHARD STREET will never be confused with a suburban shopping mall. Lining it are tenements laced with a spider's web of fire escapes. Levels and levels of coats are displayed above awesomely cluttered sidewalks. Throngs of people, all sworn never even to think of paying retail, paw suspiciously through mountains of merchandise, be it Italian silk sheets or three-for-$10 T-shirts.
In spirit, this marvelously raucous lane, which extends from Canal Street north to Houston, seems to have changed little since the turn of the century, when Yiddish was spoken everywhere and the Lower East Side was home to pushcarts, penny knife grinders and "glimmer men" who fitted eyeglass lenses by the process of elimination. 
 But a second look suggests things may have changed fundamentally. Once almost all the property owners were Jewish; now a third are from other ethnic groups, principally Chinese, and the people who live above the stores these days tend to be of Asian or Hispanic descent.
And for the first time, the traditionally Orthodox neighborhood has strung holiday lights, with a scrupulously correct mix of Jewish and Christian images.
The lights represent one small component of an effort to fight back against economic forces that have combined to pull down one of America's most famous shopping areas.
Some 400 local merchants and property owners have banded together in a business improvement district to advertise and promote the area, as well as to make community improvements. Their strategy is to burnish and market the historic character of this rambunctious bazaar -- to draw tourists and New Yorkers interested in reliving a bit of the city's more colorful history, while prowling sharklike for present-day bargains.
"If we thrive, it's going to have a ripple effect on the entire area," said David Ceci, executive director of the group, the Lower East Side District Management Association.
Two blows have particularly kicked the wind out of Orchard Street over the years. One is the gradual loss of the monopoly on Sunday shopping once enjoyed by a largely Jewish business district that closes on Saturdays; with blue laws now a two-decade old memory, Sunday shopping is ubiquitous. The other is the rise of discounting in all forms of retailing, meaning Orchard Street no longer has a special claim on bargain hunters.
Throw in a long and bitter recession, major repairs on the East River bridges, persistent parking problems, drug selling and other crime, and an exodus of many loyal shoppers to the suburbs. The result is a prolonged business downturn.
There is no body count on the number of businesses that have closed or moved, but the effect is starkly evident on Orchard south of Delancey, where the store vacancy rate is estimated by local realtors to be 15 percent.
Fixtures that have moved or gone out of business in recent years include Ezra Cohen, one of the great linen stores; Eldridge Textile Company, which featured an enormous selection of bedspreads; Penchina Textile Company, Bernstein's kosher deli and the famous Grand dairy restaurant.
"It was very unprofitable to stay where we were," said Jay Rosenfeld, owner of the 80-year-old J. Schachter's, the high-end bed shop that moved to Brooklyn in September. "You can't live on expectations."
The association, which started up in January with a $200,000 budget, acknowledges the need for some urgency. "Our No. 1 goal is to make the cash registers ring," said Mr. Ceci. "There are many stores out there hanging on by their fingernails."
Despite a reality that may be a little shopworn, the new business group is determined to sell the image of a lively, vibrant Orchard Street, not unlike the way South Street Seaport has combined historic ships, cobblestone streets and slick retailing.
"What the South Street Seaport has tried to do, we can do in a grittier, nonantiseptic manner," said Sion Misrahi, the president of the business district.
The thrust has been frankly promotional. One of the group's early actions was to hire a public relations firm, McKeefry & Company, to come up with a catchy new name and logo for the area: "Historic Orchard Street Bargain District."
There are big dreams of luring famous national stores to a place where they have never been. Mr. Ceci speaks of getting a national book chain or a Hallmark greeting card store. More immediately, the plan is to lure tour buses -- perhaps as a package with a visit to the Lower East Side Tenement Museum at 97 Orchard Street and a meal at the legendary Katz's or Ratner's or one of the newer Cuban or Chinese restaurants.
Already, some foreign tour operators include Orchard Street on their itinerary. The Brazilian edition of Vogue just featured the street, producing a stream of South American visitors.
But obstacles abound, and progress is not guaranteed. A voluntary program for stores to remain open late on Thursday evenings flopped. And the group's directors decided it could not afford the big-ticket initiatives, like their own garbage collectors, that other business improvement districts adopt.
"There are no Trumps, Zeckendorfs or Olympia and Yorks down here," Mr. Ceci said. "We have almost exclusively mom-and-pop businesses."
Also, there is the parking headache, a priority for the new business group. Two city-owned lots, on Delancey Street just off the Williamsburg Bridge, had fallen into disrepair and were to be refurbished to accommodate 100 cars with attendant parking. One lot, trumpeted by full-page advertisements, opened on Dec. 10 after a $40,000 investment. But the second is being commandeered by the Sanitation Department for its trucks. The business improvement group has been given 30 days to vacate the property.
"We're fighting to get the business district revitalized and, bingo, the city steps in and takes away the most important part of the revitalization," said Kathryn E. Freed, the City Councilwoman who turned on the holiday lights in a ceremony last month.
But the salvation of Orchard Street will hinge on more than parking and lights. It will depend on the group's ability to rekindle the fires of the past. You can still haggle in some stores, and when the light is just right you might imagine you are in a Jacob Riis photograph. Merchants also point to a commitment to quality and service that they say has long characterized Orchard Street.
"Most of our customers, when they come in, we know them by their first name," said David Gatenio, who with his brother Leon owns Carl & Sons, a men's clothing store at 172 Orchard Street.
Bill Levy, whose grandfather opened Harris Levy, a dry goods store, in 1894, said: "People couldn't get this quality of merchandise anywhere else but Madison Avenue. Nobody is rich enough that they're beyond a bargain."

HEADLINE: Communities Study Port Chester's Fight Over Topless Bar

BYLINE: By KATE STONE LOMBARDI

DATELINE: PORT CHESTER

 BODY:
EVERY night there are two live shows at the Diamond Club in Port Chester, both sanctioned by the First Amendment of the Constitution. Inside the club, in darkness interrupted by bursts of strobe light, two young women in G-strings, high heels and elbow-length gloves gyrate to music on two small stages. Male customers drinking around the stages push dollar bills between the women's breasts.
Outside the club -- which sits at the end of a shopping strip of three empty storefronts and a chicken-and-ribs restaurant -- a group of protesters picket the strip bar, carrying signs that read, "No Porn in Port Chester" and "Topless Supporters, Leave Town." 
 The owners of the club and the organizers of the pickets have already met in court. The Diamond Club owners say their establishment is legal and that the protesters are hurting business. The picketers insist on their right to protest what they describe as an immoral and degrading "male playground" in their town. In their nightly showdowns, both sides claim harassment by the other.
 
'Completely Caught Off Guard'
 "They are exploiting young girls who are too ignorant to know better, and they are destroying our community," said Goldie Solomon, who has lived in Port Chester for 45 years and is in charge of the evening protests. "There may be a place for this kind of sexually arousing dancing, but it's not in the suburbs, it's not in small towns that have residential properties entwined with commercial, and it's not in a family shopping center."
The bar and its pickets coexist uneasily now after a temporary restraining order was issued prohibiting the protesters from blocking the entrance to the club or harassing the patrons. Meanwhile, the faceoff is being carefully watched by other communities in the county, all of which want to discourage sexually oriented businesses.
Adult entertainment cannot be arbitrarily banned. The Supreme Court of the United States has held that sexually explicit dancing, books and videos -- as long as they do not fall under the legal definition of obscenity -- are protected by the First Amendment as expressions of free speech. But the Court has also permitted municipalities to place restrictions as to where such businesses can operate, as long as officials can demonstrate harmful secondary effects from the presence of the businesses elsewhere and as long as the officials do not unduly reduce access to the businesses.
George O'Hanlon, the Village Attorney for Port Chester, said that the town was "completely caught off guard" by the opening of the Diamond Club last spring.
"It was not in the forefront of anyone's mind as a potential problem," Mr. O'Hanlon said. While the village has since passed a variety of zoning ordinances to try to control the opening of other topless bars, it cannot legally close the Diamond Club, which was operating before the new restrictions.
But several communities that have been following the controversy in Port Chester have taken the position that the best defense against adult entertainment is an offense. The village of Mount Kisco, for example, currently has no topless bars, adult movie theaters, massage parlors or other sexually oriented businesses, but last month it passed a zoning ordinance to regulate the location of such establishments.
 
Two Different Approaches
 "You think of these things happening maybe in the city, but not up here -- but then when you see what's happening in Port Chester you realize it could happen anywhere," said Mayor Richard Roth of Mount Kisco. "The key word here is proactive. Instead of reacting after it happens and lawsuits being filed, you want to see what you can do to control it ahead of time."
Municipalities attempting to regulate adult entertainment through zoning have generally used one of two different approaches: concentration or dispersal. While almost all regulations confine sexually oriented businesses to industrial or commercial zoning, some towns prefer to confine such businesses to one geographic area (such as Boston, which is well known for its Combat Zone) while others prefer to spread sexually oriented establishments throughout a community and avoid creating a strip or red-light district.
In the village of Mount Kisco, the Board of Trustees has taken the dispersal route. The ordinance specifies that adult entertainment establishments must get a special permit to operate in the village. In order to receive that permit, they must conform to certain restrictions, including a requirement that no such business be within 1,000 feet of a residential district, a church, a school bus stop, a public park or a community center. Further, no adult entertainment establishment may be within 1,000 feet of another one.
"This law doesn't stop them from coming to Mount Kisco, but we are telling them if they do come, they have got to play by our rules," Mr. Roth said.
The Village Board passed the ordinance after studying reports about the effects of adult entertainment on several cities around the country. Statistics were presented noting a decline in the market value of real estate surrounding sexually oriented businesses and suggesting a correlation between a concentration of adult-entertainment establishments and an increase in crime, particularly prostitution, drugs and assault. Mayor Roth said many communities -- including Yonkers and Harrison -- had expressed interest in Mount Kisco's law.
 
Doubtful Constitutionality
 Several other municipalities in the county have cabaret laws, which specifically ban topless dancing. The town of North Castle last spring passed a law "to minimize the adverse impacts of such cabarets and yet permit their existence, thus providing for the economic and social welfare, health, peace and morals of the people of the town of North Castle." The law sets up a 23-step licensing procedure and, among other provisions, includes a section on "exposure of persons," which in great detail describes body parts, including breasts, that are not to be exposed.
Greenburgh, too, has a cabaret law, which specifies, "No female person shall be permitted to appear for the purpose of entertainment in any premises licensed hereunder with breasts uncovered or so thinly covered or draped as to permit one to see through same."
Civil liberties lawyers say, however, that such ordinances would probably not withstand a court challenge.
"These places have a right to do business," said Lynn Dewaters, executive director of the Westchester chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. "The community can protest in one shape or another within the law to bring pressure on the owners of such establishments to such a point that they would deem it a disadvantage to keep it open. But whether communities can pass ordinances to keep this from coming depends on the ordinance. Any regulations of this type would have to pass constitutional muster. They are going to have to sit on the books until someone tries to put in this type of establishment."
 
Lawsuits Expected
 Not many people believe that the county is facing an onslaught of topless bars or that such businesses would be profitable in many locations. The owners of the Diamond Club initially operated as an Italian restaurant, but after losing money, they tried to recoup their investment by converting to adult entertainment, said Frank Allegretti, the lawyer for Vincent Sorrano, co-owner of the club. In fact, on a recent Friday evening, a blackboard behind one of the dancers still offered a baked ziti special, though most patrons were sticking with beer and pretzels.
But Mr. Allegretti said that he believes such disputes will play themselves out in other towns and that communities attempting to ban sexually oriented businesses in the guise of simply controlling their locations will face an increasing number of lawsuits.
"It all depends on the layout of the town," he said. "If the so-called limitations of being adjacent to churches, schools, et cetera, in fact excludes the entire area of the town, then it's impermissible and it's going to be overturned by anyone with standing interest. There will definitely be a proliferation of these establishments popping up, and you are going to see more and more court challenges from town efforts to curb them."

HEADLINE: Companies Are Cutting Their Hearts Out

BYLINE: By Robert B. Reich; Robert B. Reich is the Secretary of Labor.

 BODY:
There used to be an unwritten contract in America between top managers and workers: If you did your job conscientiously, you could count on having that job as long as the company stayed in business. But that implicit contract is being abandoned, at an ever-faster pace. Even reasonably healthy companies are cutting their payrolls.
For the past four months, American businesses have been slashing jobs by more than 2,000 a day, a 30 percent higher rate than a year ago, when the nation was still in recession. From the standpoint of investors, this trend seems to make sense. Stock prices often spike upward after the announcement of a major cut in payrolls, even among companies that are showing no sign of bottom-line distress. The butcher metaphor of modern management seems apt: It's time to cut the fat, slash the excess, get lean and mean. 
 Enthusiasm for corporate downsizing is particularly strong among large institutional investors like pension funds, which are exerting increasing influence within corporate board rooms. Pension fund managers are quick to defend their new appetite for corporate downsizing, even though they represent the retirement incomes of workers who may lose their jobs as a result of the cutting. Making American companies more productive is in everyone's long-term interest, or so the argument goes.
But I want to sound a cautionary note. Are we in danger of overdoing it?
A recent study of 531 mostly large companies by the Wyatt Company, business management consultants, found that although three-quarters of the companies had cut their payrolls, most reported that the cuts had failed to achieve their expected results. Of the companies surveyed, earnings increased for just 46 percent of them; while 58 percent expected higher productivity, only 34 percent experienced it; while 61 percent sought to improve customer service, only 33 percent concluded that they'd achieved it. Even more tellingly, within a year after making the cuts, more than half of the companies had refilled some of the positions.
The results of the Wyatt survey are corroborated by another recent study, by Kenneth De Meuse, who teaches management at the University of Wisconsin at Eau Claire. De Meuse found no evidence that large layoffs improved, or even stemmed the decline in companies' financial performance. Now, of course, it may have been that these companies were already heading for trouble before they made the cuts, and would have been far worse off had they not made them. But, together with the Wyatt results, De Meuse's conclusion certainly raises the question whether the typical upturn in stock prices immediately upon announcement of a layoff is based more on a collective anticipation by investors that other investors will respond positively to the same news, than it is on any change in the fundamentals.
Perhaps radical surgery needs time to take hold. I know of no reliable studies of the long-term effects of deep cutbacks, but there is cause for concern in the here and now. The first casualties are the morale and loyalty of the employees who remain on the payrolls. Although they do not register directly on balance sheets, high employee morale and loyalty are often among the most important of a firm's assets. Paring the payroll may imperil these assets in ways that escape profit and loss statements but profoundly affect competitive advantage.
Visiting many American workplaces, I have heard the same refrain: "Everybody's scared. . . . I don't know how long they'll keep me. . . ." Employees fearful of getting the ax are hardly likely to pursue labor-saving innovations. Nor are they likely to volunteer that extra time and energy that so often makes a difference in productivity.
Another casualty is the cumulative experience of those whose jobs are eliminated. Knowledge that comes from years of hands-on work with products or technologies, or years of dealing with certain customers, is often the key to discovering needed improvements. But financial officers tend to see only the wages and benefits paid to an employee, narrowly weighing them against the value of that employee's current output.
Several years ago, I was asked by a group of design engineers at a large computer company to help devise a strategy for convincing their financial officers why the company should manufacture rather than purchase a particular component. "They think it's cheaper to buy rather than build," one of the engineers complained, "and it is today. But if we don't make it in-house, we don't gain the experience and knowledge that goes with making it. And then we can't develop a whole range of technologies that are likely to evolve from that component."
Some would argue, of course, that downsizing strategies are still preferable to the alternative of allowing companies to continue their slothful ways. So long as the cuts result in greater output per employee, downsizing would seem to make sense even at the cost of some employee morale, loyalty, knowledge and experience. The test, after all, is profitability.
This argument would be a stronger if the only means of improving productivity was by way of the butcher. But another approach is possible. At the risk of stretching metaphors, let me describe it as the way of the baker. The butcher improves productivity by cutting away whatever seems unnecessary; the baker improves it by enhancing the value of all the ingredients.
The baker strategy is to invest in the skills of employees by providing them with training, both on and off the job. It provides front-line workers with substantial authority, so they can make decisions about how to improve the production process and increase sales. And it gives employees a degree of employment security by tying their wages to profits or to productivity gains. That way, when hard times come, they are shared by everyone rather than only by those who are axed. When profits return, everyone will share in them as well.
Does the baker approach really work? A number of independent studies provide hard-nosed evidence that it does. An extensive review of 27 econometric studies concludes that the introduction of profit-sharing typically yielded 3 to 5 percent higher productivity. Of 29 studies examining employee participation in company decision-making, 14 showed positive effects on productivity, 2 showed negative effects and 13 had ambiguous results.
The implementation of employee training also seems to boost productivity. One study found that companies that introduced a formal training program had at least a 17 percent larger rise in productivity than companies that did not.
Last year M.I.T. researchers compared two groups of automobile factories that were similar in every respect except that in the first set, all three practices -- employee involvement, profit-sharing or productivity gain-sharing, and training -- were followed; in the second, none. The study found that workers in the first set of factories manufactured vehicles 8 hours faster, on average, than workers in the second, and with fewer defects per car.
Higher productivity through baking rather than butchering translates directly into higher profits. In a recent survey of more than 700 companies from all major industries, researchers from Rutgers University found that businesses that used one or more employee-friendly strategies had higher annual shareholder returns, and higher gross return on capital, than companies that did not.
How do these opposing approaches affect the economy as a whole -- a question of critical importance to pension funds and other large institutional investors that have broad holdings across American industry? Consider the effect of widespread downsizing on consumer confidence: workers who have lost their jobs and not yet found new ones tend to consume less than those who are fully employed. Even full-time employees watch their wallets when they're worried that their job may be the next to go. The current recovery would be more buoyant were it not for such anxieties.
Even when a company becomes more productive by trimming its payrolls, America as a whole does not necessarily become more productive. A company's books may show an increase in output for each worker remaining on the payroll after others have been let go; but the output of the nation as a whole must also take into account the fates of the workers who have been forced to leave. If they promptly found new jobs where they could be at least as productive, the nation's total output would be enhanced. But fewer and fewer Americans who lose their jobs are finding new jobs this easily.
The typical duration of unemployment continues to grow. In the 1970's, an average of 11 percent of the nation's unemployed were out of work for six months or longer; in the 1980's, 15 percent were jobless for half a year or more; thus far in the 1990's, 16 percent. Last year, 21 percent of the unemployed had not worked for six months or longer -- the second-highest annual level since the end of World War II.
We all pay the price, not only in lost output and potential tax revenues. Regular unemployment insurance benefits, paid for by payroll taxes, have averaged $22 billion annually (adjusted for inflation) over the past five years. Federal extended benefits for those who have used up their regular six-month insurance have cost an additional $12 billion in each of the last two years.
The Clinton Administration is designing a comprehensive re-employment system to help these Americans get good jobs as quickly as possible after being laid off. Job search assistance, job counseling, job retraining and extra income support during retraining -- all are urgently needed because of changes in technologies and global markets that require Americans to move from job to job at a faster pace than before. The current wave of downsizing makes these re-employment reforms even more necessary.
Downsizing can, of course, be an efficient means of moving the nation's workers to jobs where they can be most productive with their existing skills. But downsizing does not increase the value a worker contributes to the economy, because it does not enhance the worker's skills. It merely reallocates work.
It is difficult to have it both ways. The more we butcher, the less we bake. Other advanced industrial countries face the same choice, but have tended to do more baking. Look behind their current recessions and you see highly competitive work forces. A recent study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development is revealing. In 1991, 27 percent of American workers had been with their current employer for less than one year; 62 percent for less than five years. At the other extreme is Japan, where only 10 percent of workers had been with an employer for less than a year, and 37 percent less than five years. Only 25 percent of American workers had been employed by the same employer longer than 10 years, compared with more than 40 percent in Japan, Germany and France.
Average length of stay in the job is in direct proportion to the amount of training provided on the job to young employees. The correlation is logical. Before a company will invest in training, it must be confident that the worker will be around years from now when the training will fully pay off. In the United States, only about 10 percent of young workers receive any formal company training, compared with more than 50 percent in Japan and Germany.
I do not mean to overstate the case. Many fine companies in the United States are reducing their payrolls while at the same time seeking to enhance the skills and involvement of workers who remain. Moreover, one of the great strengths of the American economy -- in contrast to that of Japan and most of industrialized Europe -- is a highly mobile labor market, and we must do nothing to reduce that flexibility. I simply wish to urge investors -- especially the large institutional investors like pension funds -- to reconsider their assumptions. Rather than pressure firms to cut payrolls, they may do better to insist that companies invest more in their workers.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 19, 1993, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An essay by Robert B. Reich on page 54 of The Times Magazine today, about corporate downsizing, includes an outdated statistic about job cuts. In the last four months, American businesses have been eliminating jobs at a rate of 2,600 per business day, not 2,000 per day. The essay also misstated the increase in that rate. It is 5 percent higher than in 1991. The comparison "30 percent higher than a year ago" is erroneous.

HEADLINE: Hartford Firm Tests New Legal Issues

BYLINE: By SUSAN KARLIN

 BODY:
RECENTLY, a husband and wife consulted a Hartford lawyer, Maggie Cassella, about a problem they had. In a few weeks, the man could become a woman. But doctors said they would only perform the sex-change operation if the couple were divorced, because two women could not legally be married.
The couple, still very much in love, wished to continue living together after the operation. They wanted Ms. Cassella to handle the legal work of the divorce and a subsequent property-sharing agreement that would substitute in certain respects for a marriage contract. 
 "This is why my mother doesn't want to talk about my work," said Ms. Cassella, who is 32 years old and has built a practice helping gay and lesbian clients navigate a legal system designed for heterosexuals. Since founding Cathcart & Cassella nearly six years ago with Frank Cathcart, 37, Ms. Cassella has written contracts and probate documents covering property ownership, drafted wills, powers of attorney and bankruptcy documents for AIDS patients as well as handled conventional criminal, personal injury, small business and divorce cases.
 
'She Hangs In' With Clients
 "She's seen a lot of people fall to the ravages of AIDS and resulting financial problems and she hangs in with them far beyond what their families are willing to do," said a law school classmate who now practices family and probate law, Judith C. Benedict.
This month, Ms. Cassella begins the first adoption by lesbian parents in Connecticut. It will be the adoption of a baby by the lesbian partner of the the biological mother who became pregnant by artificial insemination. Given the success of similar adoptions in nine states including New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts, Ms. Cassella and a team that includes Ms. Benedict, Philip Tegeler, a lawyer with the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union, and Ruth Harlow, the associate director of the Lesbian and Gay Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union, are confident in their clients' case.
"We don't see any reason why it should not be granted given Connecticut's adoption laws, which do not discriminate according to marital status and offer special procedures for adoptions with special circumstances," Ms. Cassella said. "Plus, our clients are economically stable, have a longstanding relationship and are well-educated, which are important criteria in adoption cases."
 
Recognizing Nontraditional Families
 Mr. Tegeler added that if this case is successful, "it will be an important step toward recognizing nontraditional families in Connecticut."
Ms. Cassella's affinity for her legal niche stems from her own life as a lesbian, forced to draft similar agreements with her companion of 13 years and accustomed to living in a gray area of partial legal and social acceptance.
No marital laws protect the rights and property of gay and lesbian couples, because courts regard them as partners rather than spouses, she said, and wills and cohabitation contracts are often contestable. There are no guarantees that a gay or lesbian spouse will be granted a share of the estate or custody rights of the companion's child. "I've even had people fighting over ashes," Ms. Cassella said.
 
Law Open to Interpretation
 With law open to interpretation, Ms. Cassella said she has often found even the best of her legal arguments at the mercy of prejudice, particularly in criminal cases in which clients have been arrested for picking up members of the same sex.
"One prosecutor referred to my client as 'those people,' and when I asked him what he meant by that he refused to answer," Ms. Cassella said. "If someone's breaking the law, arrest them and put them through the system, just like everyone else. The slurs can really be left at home."
She added: "Then there are the lawyers who say, 'I just want to tell you that I don't approve of homosexuality.' When I tell them that I'm a lesbian and that a lot of gays and lesbians using their firm might be interested to know their feelings, they immediately backpedal."
 
Perceptions of Clients
 Her law firm partner, Mr. Cathcart seconded her perceptions. "I'm a straight white guy, so I've never experienced prejudice growing up as a kid, but I get it vicariously through Maggie and how gay clients are perceived," he said. "Laws treat gay couples differently than married couples. Sometimes, other lawyers are weird about their own gay clients. They don't say anything, you can just pick up on it. Maybe I've been sensitized."
Happily, Ms. Cassella said, those kinds of incidents are becoming more the exception than the rule. "If you're out and you're honest with people about who you are right up front, it tends to be a little easier," she said. "I've had attorneys who have been practicing nearly three times as long call me for advice in heterosexual cohabitation breakups and that clearly flatters me."
Ms. Cassella, who grew up in Bethany, began wrestling with the idea that she was gay at 17; the following year three high school classmates spotted her in a gay bar. "It actually made it easier, because then everyone knew and I didn't have to go through the process of trying to cover it up," she said. "Still, two of the people who saw me refused to talk to me afterward."
 
Paralegal and Teacher
 She graduated from the University of Connecticut in 1982 and worked as a paralegal for the Connecticut Women's Educational and Legal Fund in Hartford and taught philosophy at the Loomis Chaffee School in Windsor before returning to her alma mater for law school. After graduating in 1987, Ms. Cassella worked as an associate at Krass, Jacobson & Gussack in Hartford. When she and Mr. Cathcart began their own firm six months later, Ms. Cassella painted houses for two months to support the practice until business picked up, largely from word of mouth and advertisements in publications catering to gays and lesbians.
"We wanted to provide good service at reasonable rates and not have a stuffy attitude that's so stereotypical of lawyers," said Mr. Cathcart, who tends to handle more cases involving landlord-tenant disputes and litigation. "If we're not seeing clients or have to go to court, we wear jeans to the office."
It was around this time that Ms. Cassella began her foray into what has become a thriving avocation -- stand-up comedy -- when she was asked to be a host at the Hartford Gay Pride Rally in 1988. There, she was spotted by a fellow performer, Lea DeLaria, who gained national attention this spring as the first openly gay comic to appear on a late-night talk show. Ms. DeLaria introduced her to the gay and lesbian comedy circuit and Ms. Cassella began performing one weekend a month and wrote for the PBS sketch comedy show, "The World According to Us." Then her performance at the March on Washington for Gay and Lesbian Rights in April landed her steady weekend bookings along the East Coast.
 
Attractive Plus Biting and Sharp
 It was also strong enough to grab the attention of Los Angeles casting directors. "Maggie is an attractive woman and her comedy is biting and sharp, which is what I like in a comedian," said Tammara Billik, who runs a casting company in Los Angeles that has included among its clients the Fox television series "Married With Children." "Pretty and funny is a look we don't see that often and I thought she was inherently castable."
Ms. Billik arranged meetings with colleagues during a trip Ms. Cassella made this fall to Los Angeles, where she also took her first stab at a mainstream audience at the Improvisation in Santa Monica. There, she held court with a sassy romp through gay-themed political, social and relationship issues. "I'm a lesbian and lawyer," she announced to the startled but intrigued audience. "So you don't know whether to hold on to your wife or your wallet. Either way, I win."
Ms. Cassella, whose recent appearances have included performances in a Methodist Church in Brooklyn, N.Y., and in an "All Women, All Comedy" show in Long Beach, Calif., is booked for shows in Michigan in March and at Town Hall in Manhattan in June. Despite her growing success as a comic, "I'm not going anywhere unless someone offers me a series," Ms. Cassella said with a laugh. "Being a lawyer is not always the most fun profession, but I'm not going to give up a job in which I can serve my community and feel am getting better at by the day, for a job that's uncertain."
She added a third professional hat last year, when she and Gary Bechard, a local club owner, opened a lesbian bar in Hartford. Five months later, a third partner, Terry Milling, helped turn the business into a successful jazz club open to everyone called City's Edge. On occasional Sunday nights, the club features gay and lesbian performers, including Ms. Cassella.
For now, the seemingly disparate businesses actually complement each other. "They're all a big schmooze," Ms. Cassella said. "Speaking in front of 750,000 people in Washington makes it easier to speak in front of a judge in court with a couple of people sitting around. It definitely gives you an edge with the oral presentation part of it. Although you never laugh in court -- unless, of course, the judge makes a joke."

HEADLINE: Listen, New York Needs Rail Freight Access

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "A Senator Paralyzes Transit Planning" (editorial, Dec. 10):
State Senator Norman J. Levy of Long Island is right. Lack of freight access to New York City and its Eastern suburbs is the major impediment to our economic recovery, particularly in the manufacturing and wholesaling segments of our economy. 
 As the result of the lack of significant rail freight service, more than 96 percent of this region's land freight is handled by truck. According to a March 1993 report by the New York City comptroller the rail share of our area's freight market is about 2.8 percent, compared with 26 percent nationally. The result is economic stagnation, monumental congestion and deteriorating air quality.
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority and its Long Island Rail Road and Metro North subsidiaries see freight service as a nuisance. Requests by the Long Island's freight department for the equipment to provide service through the clearance restrictions that blockade this region, nearly 15 years after a state program to remove these problems was financed and initiated, fall on deaf ears in a state that wishes to devote every available dollar to the M.T.A.'s passenger services.
State Senator Levy, one of the few people in state government who understands the link between rail freight service and jobs, had no choice but to pull rank and block M.T.A. funds to get long-needed attention to this critical economic problem. Fortunately, he has the legislative clout to have some effect.
Logic, reason, economic facts and the catastrophic loss of jobs in this region owed to lack of adequate freight services have not been enough to alter this state's budget priorities. Political will and State Senate seniority leverage are the only answers. Norman Levy is to be applauded in his efforts toward rationalization of freight transportation in this long-ignored region of New York State's economy.

HEADLINE: Japan's Promising New Leader Seems to Lose His Magic Touch

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 16

 BODY:
When he swept into office five months ago as the unlikely leader of a political revolution, Morihiro Hosokawa was hailed as the Prime Minister who could finally change Japan. He reveled in American-style politics -- from teleprompters to polo shirts to brisk tennis games -- and promised to end Japan's political corruption and economic collusion.
But after a blazing start, Mr. Hosokawa seems to be losing his magic touch. The programs on which he staked his leadership, reforming the political system and deregulating a languishing economy, have bogged down. Tokyo's back-room deal-making, which he denounced for years as Governor of a southern prefecture, is beginning to engulf him. Time and again in recent weeks he has struggled to keep ideological rifts between the Socialists and the seven other parties in his fragile coalition Cabinet from splitting the Government apart. So far it has held together, but at great political cost to Mr. Hosokawa.
 
Motivated by Bitterness
 The bureaucrats who ran the country for four decades with the now-deposed Liberal Democratic Party snipe about the new Government's disorganization, whispering over lunch in Kasumigaseki, the Government center, that Mr. Hosokawa is proving himself a small-town politician. He is uninterested in foreign relations, they say, at sea when it comes to handling the economy, unwilling to delve into policy details. Editorialists have begun to complain that his Government is long on symbolism but short on action, too captivated by the example of another former Southern Governor across the Pacific. 
 Much of the criticism is motivated by bitterness: many in Japan have a strong vested interest in seeing Mr. Hosokawa fail. Most of the problems he faces, especially an economic slowdown that is far worse than anyone expected, were inherited from the previous Government. It is far from clear that if the Liberal Democrats had stayed in power the economy would be better off or Japanese would feel more secure in their jobs.
But even American officials say their early hopes that Mr. Hosokawa would move swiftly to address the persistent economic tensions between Japan and America are waning.
"What's going on is no mystery," a senior Clinton Administration official deeply involved in dealing with Japan said the other day. "Everyone's expectations were high, probably far too high. And we're discovering once again that change in Japan is not like change in Washington."
Mr. Hosokawa's closest allies are urging patience, saying that cleaning up a corrupt political system has been such a wrenching battle that the Prime Minister has not been able to turn to anything else.
 
From His Allies, A Plea for Time
 "We need some more time," Masayoshi Takemura, the chief Cabinet Secretary and head of one of the reform parties allied with Mr. Hosokawa, said in an interview. "Some of the criticisms are correct. But I think that soon you will see the outlines of our ideas."
There has been little progress on the issues Washington cares about most. While Japan's worldwide trade surplus has narrowed slightly in the last month, the gap with the United States is continuing to widen and the year-end figure may exceed the record of $57 billion.
After months of restraining their public criticisms for fear of undercutting Mr. Hosokawa's reform efforts, Clinton Administration officials have begun to complain of backsliding in Japan's commitments to buy foreign computer chips, supercomputers and cellular telephones. Once again there are rumblings about trade sanctions. American and a few Japanese officials complain that Mr. Hosokawa has been so focused on domestic political issues that he has not yet focused on the main set of trade negotiations under way with the United States, the broad "framework accord" agreed upon in July between President Clinton and Kiichi Miyazawa, Mr. Hosokawa's predecessor.
 
High in the Polls, But Little Power
 Earlier this month the Administration sent a mission to Tokyo to urge certain politicians to get engaged in the negotiations quickly, overriding the protective tendency of the bureaucrats conducting the day-to-day talks. Few expect Mr. Hosokawa to get involved, though, until just before a meeting with President Clinton in February.
Polls show that Mr. Hosokawa is still enormously popular among Japanese voters, with approval ratings upward of 70 percent until recent missteps pushed them down to the high 50's and low 60's.
Nonetheless, the extraordinary popularity figures have not been enough to enable Mr. Hosokawa to push through his broad political reform legislation, which would change the nature of Japan's electoral districts and impose stricter controls on campaign funds. The Liberal Democrats have dragged their feet, hoping to embarrass the new Government without being blamed for the failure of the bill. The Socialists, the biggest party in the coalition, fear the new system would marginalize them.
While the bill has passed the lower house of Parliament, the chances of getting it through the upper house are 50-50 at best, even with the 45-day extension of the parliamentary session that Mr. Hosokawa obtained this week.
If the bill fails, Mr. Hosokawa may be forced to call a new election. That is his most potent threat, because the leaders of the Liberal Democratic Party, ousted this summer after 38 years in power, are desperately trying to prevent their once-monolithic party from fracturing further. An election would probably result in defections, as younger members of the party jump ship to join the reformers.
"The party is in a chaotic condition," said Takeo Nishioka, one of four legislators who recently quit the Liberal Democratic Party and who has been voting with Mr. Hosokawa. "The party's problem is that there has been no discussion of what went wrong, why we left power and who should be blamed. That condition must change."
The most serious charge leveled against Mr. Hosokawa these days is that he has followed the footsteps of the Liberal Democrats too closely. That was deliberate: to reassure Japan's allies, and an instinctively cautious electorate, the new Prime Minister declared even before taking office that he would follow the main tenets of foreign and economic policy set by the Liberal Democrats.
For a while the strategy worked. "In the L.D.P. there was a feeling of shock, going from the party in power to the one in opposition," said Hiroshi Mitsuzuka, the leader of the largest faction among the Liberal Democrats. "Hosokawa, being smart, did not give us any room to attack him. His popularity has been so high that if we fought him, we would be the ones to get bloody."
In fact Mr. Hosokawa's flair has, until very recently, garnered far more attention than the substance of his actions. The Japanese media marveled at how he pointed directly at questioners with his pen when holding news conferences and spoke in clear, declarative sentences. He went further than any of his predecessors in breaking some major taboos: he went to South Korea and apologized for Japan's 40-year occupation of the country, and talks openly about the need for politicians, not bureaucrats, to set the national course.
 
High on Fashion; Low on Ideology
 Meeting world leaders, he appeared young and vigorous: he showed up at the Asian summit in Seattle wearing an aviator's scarf, even wowing Clinton Administration officials who thought they had mastered the art of classy informality. A few weeks ago a fashion industry group voted him one of Japan's best-dressed men, something that would have been said about few of his aging predecessors.
But over time the apparent absence of a governing ideology has created an intellectual void at the center of the new administration. To hold the Socialists in the coalition and to pass the political reform legislation, Mr. Hosokawa has been fearful of breaking new ground on any of the other major issues affecting Japan: rising unemployment, the need to rethink a defense policy born in the cold war and an industrial policy still focused on spawning new industry rather than restructuring faltering and inefficient sectors of the economy.
Three weeks ago, when Mr. Hosokawa's Defense Minister suggested that the Constitution may have to be revised to make it easier for Japanese troops to take part in a broad range of United Nations peacekeeping activities, he was summarily dismissed. It made no difference that many of the leaders of the new Government -- especially Ichiro Ozawa, who led the defections against the Liberal Democrats and has acted as the shadow power behind Mr. Hosokawa -- have often expressed the same view. Any debate on the issue threatened to tear the Government apart, because the Socialists have long challenged the constitutionality of Japan's Self-Defense Forces, and watered down the legislation that allowed them to go on a first peace mission this year, to Cambodia. Mr. Hosokawa has yet to say what he thinks.
 
A Promise Made But Not Kept
 Days later, when the Japanese stock market plunged, Mr. Hosokawa immediately announced that the Government would step in with a stimulous package -- perhaps, it seemed, even with a long-rumored tax cut to get consumers spending again. But as soon as the market rebounded a bit, he backtracked, saying he was still considering his next economic moves. Now it appears those steps will not be decided until after the new year, and it would take months, or years, for them to take effect.
The behind-the-scenes battles taking place over economic policy -- whether to lower taxes, begin deficit spending or intervene more to prevent workers from being laid off -- became clearer this week with the release of a report on deregulating the Japanese economy and spurring growth through increasing domestic demand rather than exports.
The committee began with ambitious goals, many of them set out by the Prime Minister. But its report was watered down by the powerful bureaucracy. By the time it appeared, it contained few specifics and one member of the commission, Yotaro Kobayashi, the chairman of Fuji Xerox, said its success would "depend very much on how long Hosokawa's Government will last."
Mr. Hosokawa's biggest success so far, but his messiest, has come over the emotional issue of opening the rice market. It was an inevitable step, and leaders of the Liberal Democrats were thankful that after 38 years in power, the moment to make the concession, part of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks, came just a few months after their ouster.
To keep the coalition together, Mr. Hosokawa went through a charade of opposing the move, sending his Foreign Minister, Tsutomu Hata, to Geneva in a mission that was ostensibly to plead for an exception to the market-opening requirements. For days it appeared that the Socialists, who have long opposed any market openings, might bolt from the coalition, bringing the Government down. In the end they decided they enjoyed their first taste of power too much and stayed in.
While Mr. Hosokawa won, he looked weak, because he was unwilling to argue in public, as he has in private, that the rice industry was one of the inefficient, declining industries that Japan had to restructure.
Mr. Mitsuzuka, the Liberal Democratic leader, compares Mr. Hosokawa to one of his famous ancestors, Yusai Hosokawa, a 16th-century feudal leader, and a leading poet of his time. "He was famous for not offending anybody and surviving with good tactics," Mr. Mitsuzuka said. "That way the Hosokawa family survived. Probably, the Prime Minister is like him."

HEADLINE: Inman's Business Record Includes Bankruptcy of Defense Contractor

BYLINE: By STEPHEN LABATON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AUSTIN, Tex., Dec. 19

 BODY:
At his introduction in the Rose Garden last week as the nation's next Defense Secretary, Bobby Ray Inman promised to apply the experience he had gained in corporate America to the Pentagon, in the hopes of bringing what he called the "best business practices" to the Government and getting "a dollar value for a dollar spent on defense."
But during the 1980's, Mr. Inman presided over a costly business debacle, a leveraged buyout that resulted in the bankruptcy of Tracor Inc., a Fortune 500 military contractor that made submarine and aviation weapons systems. 
 Once the largest commercial employer in Austin, Tracor is now a small part of what it used to be. Although it has emerged from bankruptcy and is now considered financially healthy, the company became a casualty not only of the excesses of Wall Street in the 1980's but also of mismanagement, cost overruns and shrinking Pentagon spending. To bankruptcy experts and technology executives, the fall of Tracor is a case study in how not to run a business.
"Tracor was like a lot of other deals in the mid to late 1980's," said Robert Miller, a bankruptcy lawyer who represented many of the company's creditors during its reorganization. "The management substantially overpaid for the company and tried to expand it, and ultimately it hit the skids."
Frank McBee, Tracor's founder, said in an interview that Mr. Inman was wise to return to Washington, where he "at least knows his way around." He pointedly did not want to discuss anything about Mr. Inman's stewardship.
Nine months after Mr. Inman, a retired admiral, abruptly left as Tracor's chief executive and chairman in December 1989, the company filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. By all accounts, its debt problems were caused by bad management and by the effort to take it private, both of which were led by Mr. Inman.
As Tracor was sinking, Mr. Inman continued to receive a large compensation package, according to documents later filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Inman received nearly $1 million in 1989, including $422,000 in salary, $250,000 in deferred compensation and a $300,000 bonus from the previous year. Two other executives were paid even more money.
The company never disclosed how much Mr. Inman was paid in 1988, his first year at Tracor.
To Mr. Inman's critics, the story of Tracor illustrates his penchant for big spending on high-tech defense, a penchant that will undoubtedly come under considerable scrutiny as he moves on to head the world's largest procurement organization. The Pentagon's $262 billion budget this year will be larger than the budgets of many small nations.
 
Blames Wall Street
 A member of President Clinton's Cabinet who has closely followed Mr. Inman's career over the years expressed some concern about the former Admiral, observing that he seemed to be an expert at spending money but not particularly adept at raising it or saving it or at cutting costs.
Mr. Inman said in an interview today from his home in Austin that the bulk of Tracor's problems had been caused by bankers and lawyers from Wall Street, whose excessive fees had added significantly to the cost of buying the company and had led it down a road of debt that eventually broke Tracor's back.
He also acknowledged that cost overruns and performance problems while he headed the company had reduced its flow of cash, making it even harder to service Tracor's crushing debt load.
"I would say that the lesson I took from Tracor was that you don't do a leveraged transaction at a time of contraction," he said. "Because unless you have the cash flow, you're not going to be in control of your fate."
But he also conceded that the military side of Tracor had stubbornly resisted cutting costs, a mindset that has dominated the defense-contracting industry.
Asked how he would apply this experience to the Pentagon, he said, "We're going to have to change the procurement system." He declined to comment on any future policies before his confirmation proceedings.
Arguing that it would be unfair to focus simply on his two years at Tracor, Mr. Inman said he had also played significant roles in helping to reshape Fluor, Southwestern Bell and Xerox as a member of the boards of those companies. He said it was those experiences he had referred to when touting his business background at the White House ceremony.
Since 1987, Mr. Inman has also served as a director of Dell Computer and until last week was the head of its audit committee. The company is now under investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission for improper currency speculation. But executives at Dell said there was no evidence Mr. Inman had been involved in the questionable trading or in possible securities violations for failing to disclose losses from the currency speculation.
Mr. Inman said today that when he and the board had learned of the currency transactions, "we were taken by total surprise."
The decision to undertake a leveraged buyout of Tracor was made during the heady days when Wall Street was realizing enormous profits from such transactions, a time when high-yield, high-risk junk bonds were beginning to dominate the world of corporate acquisition.
It was also a time when market illusions were frequently confused with economic realities.
In the typical leveraged buyout, a small group of investors buys a publicly held company by borrowing money and using the acquired company as collateral, much the way a new-home buyer uses a house as collateral. The group then repays the loans with money generated by the company it is buying. If successful in making the company more efficient, the group will turn around a few years after the original deal and sell the company back to the public at an enormous profit.
 
Notable Among Notables
 Two Texas businessmen, Elvis L. Mason and Randy Best, formed a merchant bank, Mason-Best of Dallas, in 1984 that was the main force behind the Tracor purchase. Mr. Mason had a 20-year career in commercial banking, culminating in his elevation in the 1980's to chairman and chief executive of the Interfirst Corporation, one of Texas's largest banking companies. He stepped down from that post in 1983 after the company suffered huge losses from energy loans.
Mr. Mason, who declined through his secretary to comment about Mr. Inman, formed an investment group, Westmark Systems Inc., in 1986 with the intention of taking military contractors private in leveraged buyouts. He recruited an influential board for Westmark that included two former Cabinet members -- Donald M. Rumsfeld, President Gerald R. Ford's Secretary of Defense, and Drew Lewis, President Ronald Reagan's first Transportation Secretary -- and other prominent political and corporate figures, among them Robert S. Strauss, the former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, and David T. Kearns, who had headed Xerox.
Mr. Mason also recruited Mr. Inman as chairman of Westmark, hoping to make use of the retired Admiral's strong ties to the military. Mr. Inman had been a senior Navy official, the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence and had headed the National Security Agency.
In addition, Mr. Mason was impressed with Mr. Inman's experience as the founder and first head of the Microelectronics and Computer Technology Corporation, a consortium of computer software and hardware makers created in 1982 to compete with Japan's electronic giants.
In reality, Mr. Inman's four years at the helm of M.C.C., as the consortium is known, was marked by spotty results, analysts and industry executives said. Most notably, he was unable to tame the competing instincts of the member companies. Many withheld their best researchers, and some of the nation's most important technology giants, including I.B.M. and A.T.& T., refused to participate.
 
Paid 23 Times Earnings
 Westmark's first and only purchase was Tracor, which had been founded in 1955 by four engineers from the University of Texas. By 1986, Tracor had 10,000 employees worldwide, and its annual sales had grown to $632 million, making it the 81st largest Pentagon contractor and the 404th largest company on the Fortune 500. Its major products were anti-submarine weapons, decoys for heat-seeking missiles, aviation equipment and fuses.
Westmark bought Tracor for $714 million -- 23 times its earnings -- in a deal that analysts said at the time was highly overpriced. Compounding the company's problems, the stock market crashed a month later, and the value of the comapny's junk bonds headed into a tailspin.
After the stock market's plunge, Westmark's investment bankers, Shearson Lehman Hutton, grew nervous about the deal's financing. They were also worried about a Pentagon investigation into improper pricing that had begun long before Mr. Inman arrived.
A second set of investment bankers had to be brought in from Merrill Lynch to put up money to complete the deal. Ultimately, all the bankers, along with their lawyers, were paid fees and expenses of $70 million -- 10 percent of the purchase price. The costs of the deal rose further as delays in the financing forced Tracor to take out loans at substantially higher interest rates than they had originally planned.
When Mr. Inman was hired to head Westmark and Tracor, his strengths were supposed to include his Washington connections for landing new contracts and his experience running large, complex organizations. But Tracor was plagued by cost overruns, poor production controls and reduced demand for new weapons.
Instead of rising revenues and profits, the company's earnings began to slide, and it became increasingly difficult to pay bank loans. Crucial cash had already been spent to acquire three other companies: Ultron, which made data security products; Elsin, a maker of combat communications; and General Image Engineering Corporation, which specialized in camouflage technologies.
Two years after he arrived, Mr. Inman abruptly resigned in frustration, conceding as he left in December 1989 that Tracor would be better off in the hands of professional managers than with amateurs like him.
"The most disheartening part of this for me was not being able to accelerate the banks' agreeing to allow Tracor to begin to sell assets," he told a reporter at the time. "I felt totally helpless. There was nowhere to go. In the Government I could always speed things up with a letter or phone call."

HEADLINE: PREMIER OF HAITI CRITICIZES ARISTIDE

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Dec. 19

 BODY:
Three days after formally resigning, the handpicked Prime Minister of Haiti's exiled President lashed out this weekend at the man who appointed him, describing the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide as an erratic figure and questioning his willingness to return to office under internationally negotiated conditions.
The departing Prime Minister, Robert Malval, spoke on Saturday, shortly after returning from a two-week trip abroad during which he tried and failed to organize a national conference in Haiti to break the country's political stalemate. The idea was rejected by Father Aristide, who said that the security of his supporters could not be guaranteed inside Haiti. 
 Mr. Malval described the Haitian President as a man with "a serious ego problem," who along with his advisers in exile is "playing with our lives, playing with the future of Haiti."
 
Caught in a Trap
 It is the first time that Mr. Malval has publicly accused Father Aristide of hampering efforts to settle the crisis. The Prime Minister still blames the military for the collapse of a brokered accord that was to have reinstated Father Aristide by Oct. 30.
In an interview at his house, Mr. Malval described Haiti as caught in a trap between Father Aristide, the country's first democratically elected President, and the man who presided over the President's ouster in September 1991, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras.
He said neither man seemed willing to make the compromises needed to reach a political solution that would halt Haiti's steep economic decline and prevent disaster for its people.
"The country is stuck between a man who refuses to resign and a man who has made a choice to remain abroad as a sort of flag bearer, a mythic symbol," Mr. Malval said of General Cedras and Father Aristide.
"Everything Aristide is doing is meant to preserve his image among Haitians from Miami to Montreal," Mr. Malval said. "But the problem is that this country is going straight to hell and one day the myth is just going to collapse."
To step up pressure on the military, the United Nations imposed an embargo on oil sales to Haiti in October that has aggravated the suffering of the country's poor.
Aides to Father Aristide said he had vetoed the national conference not just out of security concerns but also because he feared that the proposed political gathering would result in new limits on his powers.
"When you go into a conference like this, you know they are going to squeeze you," said Robert E. White, a former American Ambassador to El Salvador who advises Father Aristide. "If the President had accepted the conference and then refused to go along with any new constraints on him, he would have looked all the more intransigent.
"As it is, no serious pressures have ever been brought on the military," Mr. White said. "They have all been applied to Aristide."
Informed about Mr. Malval's criticism by a reporter, Mr. White that said he had conferred with Father Aristide today and that the deposed President had "nothing to add" to his adviser's remarks.
 
Malval Virtually Powerless
 Mr. Malval, a 50-year-old publisher who had not previously been involved in politics, was appointed Prime Minister in August by Father Aristide after playing a crucial role negotiating the July accord with the military providing for the President's return to office.
General Cedras later refused to resign as commander of the armed forces, violating the agreement he had signed. The security forces also organized violent demonstrations in October to deter international monitors and soldiers from paving the way for Father Aristide's return.
Since then Mr. Malval's Government has been virtually powerless. Though he formally resigned on Wednesday, he still technically has authority over the Government's day-to-day affairs. Last week, President Aristide stripped him of his authority to undertake political initiatives.
Mr. Malval said that when he was appointed in August he had expected that the military would try to block Father Aristide's reinstatement. But he said that the president's behavior had surprised him.
Both Mr. Malval and diplomats who were involved in trying to organize the aborted conference said that Father Aristide, apparently distrustful of Mr. Malval, had repeatedly approved steps to resolve the political stalemate during his Prime Minister's trips to Washington, New York, Paris and Rome, only to suddenly withdraw his support.
 
Aristide Distrust of Washington
 Prime Minister Malval said that Father Aristide had abruptly withdrawn his backing for the national conference and the relaunching of an international military mission to Haiti last Tuesday after it had been painstakingly arranged with the White House and leaders in the United States Senate.
The reversal came a day after President Clinton received both Father Aristide and Mr. Malval at the White House to express support for the initiative, he said.
Aides to Father Aristide have said privately that the exiled President had grown distrustful because he suspected that Washington and diplomats at the United Nations were positioning Mr. Malval to somehow supersede him. Relations between United States officials and Father Aristide, a leftist priest, have long been uneasy.
An aide to Mr. Malval, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said that even some aides in the Prime Minister's camp had shared that suspicion during their recent stay in Washington.
"Americans did everything they could to build up Malval at the expense of Aristide," the aide said. "His invitations and meetings around Washington had every appearance of a coup d'etat in the making."
A Western diplomat who was involved in those meetings and has played a leading role in organizing diplomacy in Haiti dismissed the suspicion as "ridiculous."
Senior Administration officials in Washington have often privately expressed exasperation, however, with what they assert has been a lack of cooperation from Father Aristide.
Many diplomats concede that efforts to restore Father Aristide are now completely stalled, although the oil embargo remains in place and a delegation of military officers from the United States, France, Canada and Venezuela is due in Port-au-Prince this week to meet with Haitian Army leaders.
The delegation hopes to revive the idea of separating the Haitian police and army and involving them in efforts to rebuild the country's infrastructure under the July accord.

HEADLINE: Economy Is Humming, But Who Wrote Tune?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
Presidencies rise or fall on the strength or weakness of the economy. So it is not surprising that with almost all economic signs looking good nowadays, President Clinton and his advisers have begun to crow.
"Look at the direction we're going in," the President told a group of supporters early this month. "We have unemployment down, investment up, no inflation and low interest rates. We are moving in the right direction." 
 But in economics circles outside the Administration, even some of the President's strongest supporters -- those who believe that the Clinton policies promise significant improvement over the rest of the decade -- say he does not deserve nearly so much credit as he is claiming for what has happened in the economy so far.
 
'Corrective Process'
 "The strength of the economy now is not so much what they have done as it is a natural corrective process that's going on," said Laurence H. Meyer, a leading economic consultant and forecaster in St. Louis.
The country will surely reap benefits from the lower deficit and the international trade agreements the President worked so hard for this year, Mr. Meyer said, but those benefits will not be realized for years.
Benjamin M. Friedman, a professor of political economy at Harvard University, is another prominent economist who favors the Clinton Administration's basic policies but who believes that the improvement in the economy in the last half of this year is largely a result of the normal progression of the business cycle.
"I don't think the Clinton people deserve a lot of credit for what's happening in the economy today," Mr. Friedman said. "It is good that they addressed longer-term concerns by trying to deal with the fiscal imbalances. But that is not what generates a surge of economic activity so soon."
 
Ingredient in the Stew
 Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the head of Mr. Clinton's Council of Economic Advisers, acknowledges that Administration policy is only one ingredient in the economic stew. But she argues that the improvements of the last few months are a direct result of the budget the President managed to force through Congress last summer.
That budget, which the Administration says will cut the Federal deficit by $500 billion over five years, showed the financial markets that the President was dead serious about lowering the deficit and controlling inflation, Ms. Tyson says. As a consequence, she reasons, long-term interest rates have fallen to their lowest level in more than 20 years and the low rates have generated more investment and jobs and growth.
There is no doubt that times have begun to look good in the last few months, after more than three years in which the economy slid gradually into a recession and then crept even more slowly out of it.
The unemployment rate fell four-tenths of a point in November to 6.4 percent, the biggest monthly improvement in 10 years. The rate of inflation from July through September was only 1.8 percent on an annual basis, the slowest pace since oil prices collapsed in 1986. Construction began on more new houses last month than in any previous month in nearly four years. In October, orders and shipments of durable goods set monthly records. Hours worked, family incomes and consumer confidence are all on the rise.
In a newsletter this month to customers of his investment banking company, Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist of Bear, Stearns & Company, wrote, "The economy is now hitting on all cylinders."
As is generally the case with Presidents, Mr. Clinton's standing in public opinion polls has improved in step with the economy. In the latest CBS News Poll, taken early last week, 51 percent of the respondents said they approved of the way the President was doing his job, up from 38 percent in June.
 
Critics See No Correlation
 Mr. Clinton's political opponents give him no credit whatsoever for the way the economy is growing. Michael J. Boskin, who was chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George Bush and who is now on the economics faculty at Stanford University, said Mr. Clinton was simply lucky in his timing.
"He ran for President when the economy was doing much better than was generally appreciated," Mr. Boskin said, "and now he's riding a normal cyclical recovery."
Jack F. Kemp, who was Secretary of Housing and Urban Development under Mr. Bush, argued that the strong economy now resulted almost entirely from years of inflation-fighting by the Federal Reserve Board.
Victor Canto, an economic consultant from Southern California, said at a conference here on the economy last week that the prospects of further tax increases later in the Clinton Administration had led to increased economic activity this year.
But outside Washington, the view is that these partisans exaggerate their case as much as the advocates in the Clinton Administration overstate theirs.
Even many economists who disapprove of Mr. Clinton's politics find some value in an argument Ms. Tyson made in an interview last week. "Think about what would have happened if we hadn't fought for the budget plan," she said. "The economy was struggling to recover. What concerned the financial markets was that the deficit would continue to grow and strangle off the recovery and the rate of expansion."
In fact, economists from almost every point on the political compass say Mr. Clinton moved at the right time when he tackled the deficit while the economy was strong. They place that in sharp contrast to the mistake they think Mr. Bush made when he disregarded the deficit in 1989, his first year in office, when the economy was healthy, and then sought tax increases and spending cuts in 1990 after the economy had begun to weaken.
 
Deficit and Stimulus
 But the purpose of cutting the deficit is not to give the economy a quick jolt. "You don't want to take the position that deficit reduction is stimulating the economy," said Mr. Meyer, the consultant in St. Louis. "Increasing the deficit would stimulate the economy."
Given the strength of the economy now, most economists say it is fortunate for the Administration that the Senate killed the $16 billion grab bag of public works projects Mr. Clinton proposed at the beginning of his Presidency to stimulate the economy. Even some Administration officials say that in retrospect they believe enactment of the stimulus measure might have sent the wrong signal to the markets.
Economists also agree on the importance of low long-term interest rates play in propelling the economy. Low rates improve the housing market and put new money in the pockets of millions of homeowners who refinance their mortgages. Even more important in terms of the economy, they encourage businesses to borrow, invest and expand, creating more jobs.
Thirty-year Treasury bonds, the standard gauge of long-term rates, are now paying about 6.3 percent interest, a drop of almost a fifth from just a year ago.
The deficit-reduction package was surely one reason those rates fell, though probably not nearly so important a factor as the low level of inflation, the previous cuts in short-term rates by the Federal Reserve or the economic weakness in Europe and Japan.
 
Taking Credit, and Blame
 What is less clear is whether the lower rates are, as the Administration argues, an important element in the condition of the economy today. "I don't think they have yet stimulated investment spending," Mr. Friedman said. "The lag is longer than that. But the more important question is, Will they? The answer is that most likely they will."
At the White House, the dominant view is that Mr. Clinton might as well take credit when the economy is going well, because, as one adviser put it, "He sure as hell will be blamed if it turns sour."
Jimmy Carter bore no responsibility for the surge in oil prices that crippled the economy in 1980. George Bush did not deserve all the blame when the lid blew off the economy during his Administration, after it had overheated so badly in the Reagan years.
"In fairness, no President should be fully credited or fully blamed for the economy at any particular period of time," Ms. Tyson said.
But they are. Just ask Mr. Carter and Mr. Bush.

HEADLINE: John W. Eckman Is Dead at 74; Dean of Pharmaceutical Industry

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
John W. Eckman, former chairman and chief executive of the Rorer Group, the drug and medical products manufacturer, and a director of its successor company, Rhone-Poulenc Rorer, died Friday at Devon Manor Nursing Home in Devon, Pa. He was 74 and lived in Chester County, Pa., and Nantucket, Mass.
He died of cancer of the lymph system, his family said. 
 Mr. Eckman was known as the dean of chief executives of the American pharmaceutical industry at the peak of his career in the mid-1980's, and he remained active as a corporate director and philanthropist until he became ill earlier this year.
Mr. Eckman joined Rorer, based in Fort Washington, Pa., in 1962, when it was a long-established but low-growth company with one well-known product, the antacid Maalox, and annual sales of $15 million. Over the next two decades, analysts said, he built it into a Fortune 500 company and one of the nation's largest makers of pharmaceuticals and medical products.
 
Born in Queens
 John Whiley Eckman was born in Forest Hills, Queens, in 1919, graduated from the Trinity School in New York and attended Yale University before enrolling in the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, where he received a bachelor's degree in economics in 1943.
In World War II, he was as a submarine officer, and in his last tour of duty was the commanding officer of a captured German U-boat, which he piloted on a record 33-day undersea voyage.
After the war, he joined SmithKline and French Laboratories, based in Philadelphia, and in 1952 became vice president of Thomas Leeming & Company, later known as Pfizer. He joined Rorer in 1962 as executive vice president and was president from 1970 to 1980, chairman and chief executive from 1976 to 1985 and chairman of the executive committee from 1986 until a merger formed Rhone-Poulenc Rorer in July 1990.
In expanding Rorer in the 1970's and 1980's, Mr. Eckman used the cash flow from Maalox to acquire 20 subsidiary companies and to develop a broad variety of pharmaceuticals and specialized medical products, including high-technology surgical instruments and diagnostic equipment.
 
Charity and Civic Leader
 One of Philadelphia's best-known charity and civic leaders, Mr. Eckman contributed to and raised money for hospitals, schools, youth centers, homes for the elderly, social service agencies, urban improvement councils, historical societies and performing arts organizations.
He was also chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia from 1977 to 1981, chairman of the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association in 1981 and 1982, and a trustee of the University of Pennsylvania and a director of many companies and educational, medical and cultural institutions.
He is survived by his wife, Jane Haussmann Eckman; a daughter, Alison Eckman Beiser of Houston; a son, Stephen Keyler Eckman of Mount Airy, Pa.; two stepdaughters, Jane Darden Ziesing of Nantucket and Heather Whitney Ziesing of Chester County; two sisters, Grace Eckman Gilbert of Sun City West, Ariz., and Alice Eckman Mason of Winnetka, Ill., and a grandson.

HEADLINE: Home Is Where the Recovery Lurks

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Dec. 16

 BODY:
If the nation finally has a recovery worthy of the name, it is due in large part to the turnaround executed by home builders like Robert Spies.
Mr. Spies, based in the Dallas suburbs, builds what used to be called starter homes. These days he is keeping busy, and then some. Straight through the weekend, he tours subdivisions where he could start projects and inspects the last of the more than 100 homes he has built this year, the most since 1988. 
 Banks and savings-and-loans are competing to lend him money, and rarely does he get as far as sodding a front lawn without finding a buyer.
That is a far cry from two and a half years ago, when he was on the verge of declaring bankruptcy. The Government took over his major lender and cut off his credit. Potential home buyers were holding back for fear of losing their jobs. His work crews, idled, eventually dispersed.
 
A Painfully Close Call
 "I've gotten 'survivor' written across my chest," he said, drawing himself up with a deep breath. "By the grace of God, I made it."
The boom in home buying and building, in Dallas and much of the rest of the country, has animated the broader economy.
Builders require supplies of materials and labor. Home buyers shop for furnishings and appliances. So today's buyers and construction workers are tomorrow's customers at Sears, Ethan Allen or Circuit City.
[The Commerce Department reported on Friday that home starts were up 3.9 percent in November. Purchases by first-time buyers accounted for much of the gain.]
Visiting a construction site, Mr. Spies, 57, steps nimbly through the skeletal frame of a $100,000 home going up 20 minutes east of downtown Dallas. He prods the carpenters to stay until they use every scrap of lumber delivered that day, lest overnight disappearances cause delays.
For the first time in five years, Mr. Spies is also developing raw land for new neighborhoods, putting in roads, utilities and sewers.
Until recently, Dallas builders could buy all the lots they needed from the Government, which had seized them when the savings and loan institutions capsized. His project in east Dallas, he said, is on some of the last of those lots, its basic facilities and services provided, but then left vacant for years.
Although banks have recently become more willing to lend, their rules are new. "Ten years ago, I could virtually do a land development without putting a nickel into it," Mr. Spies said. "Today, I've got to bring the land to the deal, free and clear." To buy the land without borrowing, Mr. Spies has had to find investment partners, which has cut profits. The banks only finance the improvements.
Even so, by this fall, new single-family houses were going up at the fastest rate nationally since the mid-80's. About a third of the current 4 percent annual growth in the economy can be traced to the building of single-family houses and related spending, said Kenneth T. Rosen, chairman of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the University of California at Berkeley.
Falling prices and low mortgage rates have brought out the buyers, while banks' renewed willingness to lend has helped builders.
"Housing is the most affordable it's been in two decades," Mr. Rosen said. "It's an affordable-housing boom."
 
Recovery in Name Only
 It's also a boom that has been very slow in coming. New housing, usually the first flower of a recovery, failed to blossom this time until the limp expansion was more than two years old.
The reasons become evident in the story of Mr. Spies's near-collapse and recovery. He is the sort of builder that others in Dallas -- perhaps conscious of their industry's sometimes hucksterish, high-risk tinge -- point to as a good example, his dealings as tidy as a model home.
During the mid-80's boom, Mr. Spies was building 150 to 200 houses a year. His staff of 20 included crews to pour foundations and nail together frames. He remained conservative, borrowing only half the price of his $20,000 building lots. He turned down $10,000 a month from some savings and loan executives to do little more than front for their real estate deals. He still had plenty of money for cruises or European tours and for meals at the Dallas restaurants of the moment.
In mid-1987, regulators demonstrated their trust in Mr. Spies by installing him as a board member at two failed savings and loan institutions in Houston and asked him to liquidate them within about six months. He saw loan portfolios that included land directly under a dam. An appraisal calmly noted that the dam was opened, flooding the land, "only once a year."
Then the regulators told him they had too little money to pay off the depositors. Board members had little choice but to raise interest rates to levels among the highest in the country, in search of new capital. They drew in brokered deposits up to the $100,000 limit of Federal insurance, drawing money away from healthier institutions. His own financing came from a solid Fort Worth bank, Texas American, so he thought he had few worries.
But as more savings and loan institutions failed, the Government was saddled with more and more of the residential building lots those institutions had financed. Efforts to sell those lots only depressed prices.
By January 1989, when the savings and loans were finally liquidated, Mr. Spies was telling his loan officer at Texas American that his sales, and the value of his building lots, were evaporating.
In June, the loan officer made a call that left Mr. Spies dumbfounded. "We have been taken over by the F.D.I.C.," the banker said, attributing the bank's failure to rash real estate lending. "We can no longer make you any loans. I don't know what else to tell you."
Mr. Spies was soon instructed to repay everything he owed or lose his building lots. He and his wife talked with a lawyer about personal and corporate bankruptcy. The lawyer calmed them down somewhat. With other builders in far worse shape, Mr. Spies decided to keep struggling -- in the hope that the regulators would be willing to strike a deal.
He cut his staff from 20 to 8, as his workers left to build houses in Florida or the Carolinas or work in factories. When friends invited him to dine out or take vacations, he politely declined.
When the regulators hired specialists in working out the repayment of soured loans, Mr. Spies offered plans to pay his debts at less than full value, but more than liquidation would bring. They always demanded more information, more justification. There was no use mentioning his own role in salvaging other threatened savings and loans. "They said: 'You're one of the bad guys. You caused the problem. We know what our rights are, and you have none.' "
He eventually noticed that workout officers who struck deals and closed cases worked themselves out of their jobs, while those who lingered had cases that lingered, too.
To redeem his lots from the bank so he could continue building, he had to pay off a $10,000 loan each time, plus $1,000 or $2,000 in accumulated interest. Nearby, the regulators were selling lots for $6,000 or less.
Any profit Mr. Spies made from building went to the bank. "You were working for the Government," he said. "They controlled everything you did. They were bleeding me to death."
By early 1991, the wealth he had built up for decades was gone and the cash to continue building nearly depleted. "I was at the bottom of the barrel," he said.
A banker friend advised him that his chances of remaining a home builder were greater if he filed for bankruptcy, then started afresh.
The bankruptcy lawyer suggested a final gambit. Mr. Spies told his workout officer that he would no longer cooperate, effectively threatening bankruptcy and challenging the bank to begin liquidation.
He hoped that the liquidation department would be a brier patch, a place where deals could somehow be made. Initially, the bank pressed for the sale of his property. Mr. Spies countered with an offer to buy his business from the bank for about 50 cents on the dollar, reducing his debts by transferring them to an investor he had long known.
The bank demanded exhaustive proof that Mr. Spies was, indeed, the best and highest bidder for his own business. His legal and accounting bills mounted to a quarter of a million dollars.
At 8 P.M. on April 19, 1991, he signed an agreement with the bankers, the regulators and his investor. He had his business back, but his relief was fleeting.
"I thought I would come out the conquering hero, but I was exhausted," he said. "Like John Henry, I beat the steam engine and then collapsed."
Usually upbeat and outgoing, Mr. Spies trudged into work. His remaining assistants, aware of his battle to save their jobs, carried the business along. He looked elsewhere for inspiration, to his wife and two children, his Roman Catholic faith, and to motivational seminars and tapes.
Gradually, the local economy picked up, and interest rates worked their way lower -- "a godsend," Mr. Spies said, for his business and his spirit.
 
Lower Overhead Now
 Now, he does business somewhat differently. Instead of rehiring full construction crews, he has stayed with just eight full-time employees, building homes with subcontractors instead. Lower profits in good times also mean lower overhead in bad ones. "It smoothes out the peaks and valleys," he said.
This spring, with three years to go on his investor's five-year financing, Mr. Spies lined up new, cheaper credit from a savings and loan house. Rather than negotiate better terms, his backer was just as happy to be paid off and free himself of home building's perils.
Mr. Spies notes that the lenders who offered him an easy $10,000 a month in the 1980's, as well as another builder who took it, went to jail. The local home builders' association, he said, has only half its previous members.
But even as home building propels an accelerating recovery, Mr. Spies sees some ominous signs. New builders are entering the business, laying the foundations for the next cycle of overbuilding, overlending and bust.
"When it's real bad, you get nervous, and when it's real good, you get nervous," he said. "In two or three years, there will be another correction, and I'm not sure but that building will lead us all back down."

HEADLINE: POLITICAL MEMO;
Liberals and Republicans Scrambling for Giuliani Jobs

BYLINE: By ALISON MITCHELL

 BODY:
It's hard to keep straight all the interest groups and political leaders who are claiming credit for the narrow victory of Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani. But none are more unabashed than the leader of the state's Liberal Party, who has been introducing himself to Republicans lately as "Ray Margin-of-Difference Harding."
Of course, Mr. Harding, the girthy, occasional Terminator or King Maker of New York politics, is no stranger to that maxim about the victor and the spoils. He has helped promote two allies to deputy mayorships, and if only Mr. Harding didn't have two sons -- Russell and Robert -- New York's hothouse political establishment might not be so confused about which one is going to get the government job. (The answer probably is both.) 
 Let Republicans grumble that the Liberals are beginning to look less like a party than a jobs program. The Republicans want patronage too. For this is transition, and the whole city government as well as the government-in-waiting is caught in a game of telephone, with rumors more plentiful than packing boxes. It's a time to rake in the debts, exploit Who You Know, a time when ally turns against ally and P.C. means personal career.
 
First Chance Since Lindsay
 What makes it especially delicious -- or depressing -- depending on the side you're on, is that Mr. Giuliani's administration offers job-starved Republicans their first crack at City Hall, and the 1,500 positions under the Mayor's control, since John V. Lindsay was elected Mayor in 1965.
"After so many years out in the wilderness, it's almost overwhelming to suddenly play an active role in the selection of our municipal leadership," said City Councilman Andrew S. Eristoff, whose father, Constantine Sidamon-Eristoff was Mr. Lindsay's Transportation Administrator. "I for one was two years old the last time we elected a Republican mayor."
Already, some transition trends are clear. Social workers and labor organizers are out. Lawyers and former assistant United States Attorneys are in. Pictures of Frederick Douglass are coming down from the walls. Small photos of George and Barbara Bush will soon be on their way in.
Of course, even if they fit the profile, job seekers still have to get in the door. And the first trick is to figure out where to send a resume. The 15 job screening committees are an option. But as the selection of William J. Bratton as Police Commissioner showed, the appointee may not actually come through the committee process at all.
Getting to Peter J. Powers, the deceptively mild-mannered transition chairman, is known as the next best thing to reaching Mr. Giuliani himself. But that's not easy. "Trying to get an appointment is like trying to meet with God -- literally." said Frances Werner, the chairwoman of the Queens County Republican organization, who is peddling her own list of candidates, including State Senator Frank Padavan and Bob Bishop, the vice chairman of the Queens party.
Some aspirants in the know have taken to handing resumes to the doorman at the entrance of Mr. Powers's Upper East Side building. Some applicants send in three resumes, even four.
 
'Owed Something'
 After years of alienation, there are Republicans who remember that even with Mr. Lindsay, they didn't have easy pickings. Mr. Lindsay, after all, took fusion to such an extreme that by his second term (after losing a Republican primary) he was running as a Liberal. Soon after that he became a Democrat. And so this time the Republicans are scrambling to make sure that Mr. Giuliani, the Republican-Liberal fusion candidate, remembers them just as much as such exotica of his coalition as the Koch Democrats.
"Queens is owed something," said Ms. Werner. "The Republican Party is owed something."
Still, there are matters beyond loyalty. What about disloyalty? Carlos M. Rivera, the Fire Commissioner under Mayor David N. Dinkins who quit unexpectedly in late summer and endorsed Mr. Giuliani, when the Republican-Liberal candidate was seeking Hispanic support, has let it be known that he would like his old job back. No matter that he serves on the committee picking a fire commissioner. He has said he would recuse himself.
 
The Koch Element
 And since this is a fusion adminstration, Democrats too can seek jobs, especially if they once worked for Mayor Edward I. Koch, who endorsed Mr. Giuliani in the crucial waning days of the Mayor's race. Democrats close to Mr. Koch say he has a little list and is lobbying hard for some people, including Felice L. Michetti, the current Commissioner of Housing Preservation and Development.
"I'm not lobbying," Mr. Koch protests. Of Ms. Michetti, he says, "I do indeed recommend her, but I'm not lobbying. I have, to anyone who asked me, that they couldn't get a better commissioner of housing."
One former member of Mr. Koch's cabinet, Paul A. Crotty, has already been tapped as Corporation Counsel. Others loom on the horizon. Maria Mitchell, a former health adviser to Mr. Koch, is among the candidates for head of the Health and Hospitals Corporation. Lilliam Barios-Paoli, a former Koch commissioner, is a contender to run the vast Human Resouces Administration.
Both Donald Zucker, a developer who once served as an unpaid adviser to Mr. Koch, and James Stuckey are in contention for the job Mr. Stuckey once had, as head of the Economic Development Corporation. But a Giuliani advirser said Mr. Zucker's chances diminished after news organizations were tipped that the Zucker Organization has an X-rated video store as a tenant.
In some respects, Henry J. Stern, the quotable, eccentric, former Parks Commissioner should be a shoo-in for his old job. He's close to Mr. Koch. He's a Liberal. His longtime aide, Richard Schwartz, was Mr. Giuliani's deputy campaign manager. But in this age of cutbacks, when Parks Commissioner Betsy Gotbaum has turned to private fund-raising for the parks, some contributers have let it be known that they would not be happy about Mr. Stern's return, according to several people familiar with the lobbying.
 
Conflicting Quests?
 But at least the Parks Department, with or without Mr. Stern, will probably still be there. One of Mr. Giuliani's transition committees has been searching for a Commissioner of Mental Health, while another committee has been similtaneously considering whether the Mental Health Department should be merged with the Health Department.
Christopher Lynn, a member of the Civilian Complaint Review Board, is being touted as a candidate for Human Rights Commissioner, even though Mr. Giuliani hasn't committed to keeping the Human Rights Commission.
This kind of thing can put a damper on the job hunt. Who besides the David A. Stockmans of this world (Where is he now? Does he want a job?) would take a post eliminating their own agency?
It may take several months to answer such questions. Last week, with legions of appointments still to be made, Mr. Giuliani -- the one person in all this who knows he definitely has a job come January 1 -- put out a request to Mr. Dinkins's commissioners: to stay in place until he can find replacements.

HEADLINE: METRO MATTERS;
Challenges of Today Await Giuliani's Administration

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
"Mayors come and go but the life of the city must endure." David N. Dinkins,
 Nov. 3, 1993
IMPLICIT in Mr. Dinkins's message of continuity was the comforting fact that New York City has survived 106 mayors since 1665 and that it would probably outlast the 107th. Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani's challenge, though, will be to resolve boldly a systemic conflict that threatens not only the city but also his ability to make it to a second term. 
 The voters demanded change and Mr. Giuliani embodies it: neither he nor any member of his newly assembled team of four deputy mayors has ever served at City Hall before (Paul Crotty, the new corporation counsel, is a distinguished veteran of the Koch administration, but may find himself too far removed from daily decision-making in the mayoral orbit). The fledgling administration is long on earnestness and independence -- some say arrogance -- and short on experience. Arguably, it owes little, but knows less.
Or, as one seasoned former official said, "You don't populate a whorehouse with virgins."
The incoming administration responded dismissively earlier this month to provocative recommendations of a nonpartisan commission, created by the Dinkins administration to explore solutions to the city's perpetual budget imbalance. That approach may not bode well for an administration that asks to be measured against its stated hopes of ridding street corners of aggressive squeegee wielders and of avoiding tax increases.
"The taxpaying citizens of New York, whether businesses or individuals, are very sensitive to the housekeeping services that make living and working in the city bearable and desirable," says Donald D. Kummerfeld, a former deputy mayor to Abraham D. Beame and chairman of the mayoral commission.
"If we constantly are forced to choose between investing in housekeeping versus the overwhelming human needs of the deprived population of the city that in human and political terms demand attention, then the quality of life functions get starved or deferred, at best," Mr. Kummerfeld warns.
He suggests reserving revenues from certain fees and taxes for those functions "as a defensive measure to make sure we don't have a city that is falling apart" and warns that "otherwise, it will become another Detroit."
"In a political sense I don't think this choice has been confronted," Mr. Kummerfeld said. "I would have thought if we had any mayor in recent years who is well positioned to do that, it's Rudy Giuliani."
Mr. Giuliani's photograph is the final frame of a new exhibit on mayors opening at the Museum of the City of New York. The first depicted is Whitehead Hicks, the last mayor appointed by the British, who prudently announced in 1776 that he was "desirous to retire from the Town" and move to Flushing. Also displayed are memorabilia from the eras of Mayor Richard Varick, who was acquitted of complicity in Benedict Arnold's treason; A. Oakey Hall, who was indicted with the Tweed Ring but became a successful newspaperman; Robert A. Van Wyck, who invested in a company that sought to monopolize the city's ice supply; as well as exhibits associated with more revered mayors and Mr. Giuliani's more recent predecessors (included is a tweed worsted jacket belonging to Edward I. Koch).
The exhibit opens with Mr. Dinkins's post-election aspiration about endurance. It closes with this quotation from Mr. Giuliani, "My administration will be universal in its concerns, sensitive to our diversity, and even-handed in every way possible."
Last month, the Giuliani transition team debriefed Harvey Robins, who was director of operations under Mr. Dinkins, for suggestions to consolidate city government and deliver services more efficiently. Included were proposals to merge a number of mayoral offices into a new Agency for Neighborhood Services, shift responsibility for taxis back to the Police Department and fold the Department of Employment, the Agency for Childhood Development and the Head Start program into the Department of Youth Services.
"There are no new ideas in economics or sex," Felix G. Rohatyn once said (an adage memorialized in "Quotations from Chairman Felix," a compendium of his pithy remarks as chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation).
Only new mayors and new New Yorkers facing familiar problems. "A corporate executive cannot evade tomorrow unless he is on the verge of retirement," Mr. Rohatyn also said. "Politicians always hope that tomorrow will never come, or that, if it comes, it comes after the next election."
In less than two weeks, Mr. Giuliani, who proposed to his wife at Disney World, will find himself choosing between Fantasyland and Tomorrowland.
For the Dinkins administration, tomorrow arrives two weeks from yesterday. The inauguration Jan. 2 signals Mr. Giuliani's first official today.

HEADLINE: Voucher Plan To Aid Beggars Is Put in Place On West Side

BYLINE: By MARY B. W. TABOR

 BODY:
A community group seeking a solution to panhandling on the Upper West Side yesterday announced the city's first program in which residents can give vouchers -- redeemable for food or personal items -- instead of money to beggars.
Following the lead of Berkeley, Calif., which started the nation's first voucher program in 1991, the group, West Side Cares, began its effort this weekend as a way to "stop feeding the drug dealers and start feeding people in need," said Laura Friedman, a coordinator of the group, which includes merchants, charitable organizations and residents. 
 The program, which was met yesterday with praise and criticism from advocates for the homeless, targets 19 blocks of Broadway, between 106th Street and 125th Street. So far, 17 stores have agreed to sell the 25-cent vouchers to customers, who can give them to panhandlers. The vouchers can then be redeemed at face value for food and personal items in seven participating stores, including two Sloan's supermarkets, four smaller markets and a bagel shop.
 
Quality of Life Issues
 Like similar programs set up in a dozen cities, such as New Haven, Seattle and Chicago, West Side Cares' plan is intended to address quality of life issues raised by residents, organizers said.
As the thousands of New York City panhandlers have become more aggressive in their daily hustles, residents have bristled, Ms. Friedman said. "That is the wrong reaction," she said. "I think this will help everyone in the neighborhood -- people who genuinely need to be fed and people who want to give without being worried they are giving to drug dealers."
Christopher Fay, executive director of Broadway Community Incorporated, which offers homeless services, said that the vouchers are a "practical and compassionate response" to the panhandling problem.
And Sam Szurek, a spokesman for the New York City Department of Homeless Services, said that while he could not offer an official response from the city, he considers the voucher plan "a fine program, if it works."
 
Reactions Vary
 But advocates for the homeless and others who study poverty yesterday had mixed reactions to the program. Some said they welcomed a plan that encouraged people to give to the poor. Others, however, said the vouchers would do little more than ease consciences for those who refuse to give or who do so only out of a sense of annoyance, guilt or pity.
They say that the vouchers are simply another sign of a nation frustrated by failed social policies and they point to a report last week by the National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty that says cities are increasingly enacting and enforcing anti-vagrancy laws to jail homeless people or remove them from busy areas.
"This is just another way to avoid dealing with the real problems," said Joel Blau, a professor at the School of Social Welfare at the State University of New York, Stony Brook. "It's a substitute for a decent policy for homeless people."
Even when the beggars are not homeless, he said, the vouchers "take away a sense of independence from people giving contributions and it reduces the self-determination of people on the street." Professor Blau said he would not participate in a voucher program but prefers to give change to panhandlers he judges are less likely to use it for drugs or alcohol.
'Let's Not Kid Ourselves'
Mary Brosnahan, executive director of the city's Coalition for the Homeless, said she was ambivalent. "On the one hand, if it allows more people to feel comfortable giving to the poor, then that's great," she said. "But let's not kid ourselves that it's bringing us one step closer to a real solution."
Existing voucher programs in other cities get mixed reviews as well. In Berkeley, residents have purchased nearly 250,000 vouchers over the last two years, 70 percent of which have been redeemed. In New Haven, 40 percent of the 9,000 vouchers sold have been used. But in Portland, only 13 percent of the 8,000 vouchers sold have been traded in.
"It's not really going to change anything," said Randall K. Filer, an economics professor at Hunter College, who studies poverty. Berkeley has been successful, he says, largely because the city has a much more homogenous community with a common liberal bent and large numbers of people have agreed to participate in the program.
 
Street Currency
 "In New York, I can't imagine getting most people to agree on anything," he said. Beggars will continue to get money along with vouchers, he said. And those who do get vouchers but want money instead will simply sell the vouchers to others, turning them, like food stamps, into a form of street currency.
But on the street yesterday, shop owners, panhandlers and customers alike said they were hopeful the program would work.
"I think it will definitely help, especially for people who really need it for food," said Mitchell Moore, store manager at Sloan's grocery store at Broadway at 110th Street.
Outside, Herman Johnson, stood quietly with his back against the grocery store wall, his right hand wrapped around a tattered, empty paper cup. At this post, which he said he had held for eight hours a day for five years, Mr. Johnson, a 39-year-old man who goes by "Hollywood Hall of Fame," said that he has seen passers-by grow more reluctant to give. On a good day, he said, he can make $20, which helps go toward the rent on his mother-in-law's apartment, where he lives. On a drizzly day like yesterday, it may be less than $10.
 
'A Beautiful Idea'
 "I think it's a beautiful idea," he said. "Everyone is not living the right way. And this is sending you to a store to buy what you need for breakfast, lunch or dinner."
Lewis Brown, who said he panhandles in the area from time to time, agreed. "It's a good idea," he said. "But I wonder how many people are going to buy the vouchers?"
As she walked out of the University Food Market at Broadway and 115th Street, Gayle Mitrani, a 22-year-old senior at Barnard College, said she usually refused to give to beggars, who stand with cups outstretched for blocks surrounding Columbia University. But she said she would be willing to try giving out vouchers. "This way I'll know it's going for food," she said.
Ms. Friedman said that so far, things are looking good. As of yesterday afternoon, the second day of the program, 100 or so vouchers had already been redeemed. Though initial expenses came out of volunteers' pockets, the state is providing $3,500 in seed money, and another $1,000 will be provided by seed grant money from the office of Manhattan Borough President Ruth W. Messinger.

HEADLINE: The Marketing of Kwanzaa;
Black American Holiday Earns Dollars, Causing Concern

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
The four attendants at the ice cream stand held hands, as one of the them prayed. "Lord, give everyone who comes a hungry thirst for this ice cream," he said.
So began the Kwanzaa Holiday Expo for the Ben & Jerry's store in Harlem, one of about 300 businesses whose presence at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center over the weekend offered a convincing sign of the commercial potential of the black American holiday. 
 While Ben & Jerry's brought its exquisite sweet potato ice cream, other exhibitors showed dark-complexioned dolls, African art, Jamaican root tonic, Kente cloth neckties, handcrafted African roses and an odd contraption that gives a passable back massage.
But perhaps more telling was the presence of corporate giants like Anheuser-Busch, Pepsi-Cola, Revlon, Chemical Bank, A.T.& T. and Time-Life Books.
 
A Reflective Period
 "If Kwanzaa is what one of your target markets is involved in, it's what you need to be involved in," said Darlene Bryan, director of special markets for the Pepsi-Cola Bottling Company of New York.
Organizers of the annual trade fair, which only last year moved the Manhattan Community College into the spacious confines of the Javits Center, realize the same thing. "We have been working to repackage and remarket Kwanzaa," said Jose Ferrer, chairman of the Expo. "Corporate America seems a lot more comfortable in associating with it."
Kwanzaa, which takes its name from the Swahili word for "first fruits" and is based on African harvest festivals, begins on Dec. 26 and lasts until Jan. 1. A candle is lighted each day, gifts are exchanged and lessons are read in what is usually a family-centered, reflective period.
Maulana Karenga, chairman of the black studies department at California State University at Long Beach, who began the observance in 1966, said Kwanzaa is America's fastest-growing holiday with 18 million celebrants.
Mr. Ferrer and others involved in the marketing of Kwanzaa have stressed the message that the holiday, a cultural rather than a religious observance, is not a substitute for Christmas, not anti-Christ and not an exclusionary gesture.
"People were afraid of it, almost like it was separatist and apart," said Terry Keeling, the Woolworth Corporation's district manager for Upper Manhattan and the Bronx.
This year, Woolworth's began Kwanzaa promotions in 19 New York City stores, offering African-centered books, cards and art objects and holding a contest for children to design Kwanzaa cards. "It's moved more to the mainstream this year than any other," Mr. Keeling said.
Hallmark, for the second year, is selling Kwanzaa cards nationally. After successfully offering one card last year, the company is now selling 12 varieties. All use designs made by the Harlem Textile Works, which teaches students in various crafts.
 
More Commercial Inroads
 "We decided to give people more of what they were happy with last year," said Ronnye Peace, a Hallmark spokeswoman.
Also, Pepsi is promoting supermarket sweepstakes in two area chains, while J. C. Penney is offering for the first time several Kwanzaa products in stores around the country. Anheuser-Busch is sponsoring several events at the Expo for the first time, including a large African-centered fashion show Friday night.
Commercial inroads are also apparent in neighborhood stores outside of predominantly black neighborhoods. At Little Things, a novelty store in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn, Kwanzaa is being promoted in a special section for the first time. The merchandise includes black dolls, Kwanzaa books and Kwanzaa bears in colorful African attire, which are now almost sold out.
"We had Hanukkah and Christmas and now we have Kwanzaa," said Edith Brafman, a buyer for the store. Kwanzaa's growing importance to larger merchandisers, makes others nervous, not least because they are threatened by it. Harold Thomas, vice president of Gumbs & Thomas, a New York publisher that has sold Kwanzaa cards for eight years, said, "We have to be careful that in commercializing it, it isn't lost to the black community."
When Dr. Karenga first spelled out his concept for the holiday, one of the explicit principles he cited was Ujamma, which in Swahili means cooperative economics. He said this meant "to build and maintain our own stores, shops and other businesses and to profit from them together."
 
Trying for the Homespun
 In response to numerous queries this year about the growing corporate interest, he issued a statement, saying in part, "The challenge for the African people is to avoid the problems of commercialization that they've learned from other holidays like Christmas."
But the worry among some blacks is precisely that Kwanzaa could become more like Christmas, with its pressures to spend. Lagrane Brooks, who lives in East New York and who works for a film distribution company, said she tried to keep the holiday homespun with only small educational gifts for her 5-year-old son.
The eager exhibitors at the Expo, each of whom had paid $900 for a booth for the four-day event, certainly had no qualms about money-making. Bobbi Humphrey, the pop-jazz flutist who had a booth to sell her compact disks and a poster of one of her photographs, said: "Black people need not be embarrassed about making money. That is what pays the rent and makes America tick."
The expo itself is powerful testimony to the growing importance of Kwanzaa. It began in 1981 as a small celebration in a Harlem school, then moved to successively larger locations as participants grew. Last year, it moved to the Javits Center and drew 250 exhibitors. This year, 300 companies and individuals rented booths from the privately owned company Mr. Ferrer heads.
Mr. Ferrer predicts 50,000 people will visit the show, which closes today. He estimates they will spend $5 million. A smaller show the company staged last week in St. Louis rang up sales of $2.5 million.
For consumers, a clear result of the heightened interest in Kwanzaa is lower prices for products related to the holiday. At one booth, the price of the candleholder, called a Kinara, used for the ritual lighting of a candle, has dropped to $50 from $100 in the last several years, said Malik Ahmed, the proprietor.
Most vendors are small, with their participation perhaps representing a first venture into entrepreneurship. The New York City Housing Authority is using the expo to showcase products developed in an entrepreneurial training program it conducts for project residents. Exhibiting were the fledgling magnates of two T-shirt companies, called Ghetto Gear and Projek Wear. Besides 12 people exhibiting, the authority is taking 1,000 housing project residents in buses to see the grass-roots business activity.
Some exhibitors arrive with high expectations. Harrington Khari came from Los Angeles to sell vests he makes with African designs and messages, which he calls "wearable knowledge." Though he has never been to the Kwanzaa Expo, he said that based on his experience at other African-American bazaars, he expected to sell out $20,000 of his merchandise by today.
The hope of many is that such individual success can be marketed to corporations. In addition to Hallmark's use of the work of Harlem students, J. C. Penney and Woolworth's both bought from black producers. Part of the corporations' interest, suggested Cedric McClester, the expo spokesman, has been the presence of more black executives who have pressed their organizations to get on the Kwanzaa bandwagon.
"There is no problem with commercializing it, but who will be the benefactors of the commercialization?" Mr. McClester said. "It should be people of African descent, not just corporate America."

HEADLINE: A Bar for Wild Ones, and for Domestic Ones

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SYRACUSE

 BODY:
The kitsch-crowned Dinosaur Bar B Que here is where Armani meets heavy leather -- all right, since this is a town that avoids affectation, it's where "off the rack" meets heavy leather.
Just five years after the Dinosaur was opened by Harley-Davidson riders, the blues bar for bikers has emerged as a melting pot where the heirs of the "The Wild One" rub shoulders with people who bought their children the video. 
 "It's the kind of place where middle-age white-collar men talk earnestly about the merits of tattoos and the definition of tattoo art," said Kihm Winship, an advertising copy writer and occasional actor, before hurrying home to read the final two chapters of a Nancy Drew mystery to his young daughter.
The clientele is a melange of bikers and business people, rebels and yuppies -- united by the love of good food at reasonable prices and the unceasing wail of the blues.
 
Champagne and Ribs
 The special on the Day-Glo yellow, plastic-covered menu offers one clue to the bar's dual personality: "Dom Perignon w/rack of ribs." It's $130.
More evidence comes from the bar's Lettermanesque list of reasons why it is the best place for holiday gatherings: "Easy cleanup afterward; the wet-naps are on the table." And, of course, "Absolutely no bad Christmas songs by Pat Boone and Family."
In many ways, the red-and-white diner embodies the evolution of a mining and industrial center known as the Salt City into an academic and education center that bills itself as the Hub of the Empire State and reflexively rejects the mannerisms of larger cities in the state.
"The Dinosaur is the antidote to high-tech," said Lee Conant, the manager of a cafe in the Barnes & Noble bookstore and a caterer who rues what he says is the city's disdain for fine dining. "Instead of the knife-cutting by class, it cuts by attitude. If you can't wear it, drive it or live in it, Syracuse won't spend money on it. Nobody in Syracuse wants to spend money on food."
Just as a ring of factories once encircled this city, the Dinosaur is surrounded in warmer months with a wall of chromed Harleys. Nearby parking lots are filled with luxury sedans whose blinking red alarms turn even summer nights into Christmas. And in winter, the waiting line for tables is a recurrent pattern of plaid flannel and black leather.
 
'Everybody Fits'
 "We've got suits, we've got bikers, we've got young and we've got old," said Cheri Pomatto, a 30-year-old waitress who is expecting her second child. "Every type of life walks through here. And everybody fits. Very seldom is there a problem; very seldom is there any kind of fight."
The Dinosaur goes out of its way to cross-pollinate road warriors with intellectual wanderers, contributing $40 toward employees' first tattoos. A sign on the wall says, "Friends don't let friends eat tofu."
"The waitresses are biker chicks, but you're likely to get one with a British accent," said Rudy Kerven, a customer with a degree in accounting who alternates between being an unemployed roofer and an unemployed pianist.
The bar provokes a continuing conversation between customers by encouraging them to scrawl graffiti on its bathrooms' legal-pad-yellow walls. The Dinosaur takes great pride in these musings and devotes a segment of its monthly newsletter to the staff's favorite sayings. "You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll think!!!" promises the section, "It Came From the Toilet."
Harleys and dinosaurs may have become the latest life-style statements, what conspicuous consumption was to the Me Generation years.
 
Hillbilly Dinosaurs
 The bar grows out of a food stand opened a decade ago at a campground with a primitive theme.
"At the time, the music scene was terrible, we were still listening to the Allman Brothers and I was riding a '57 Panhead," said John Stage, the principal owner. "We were dinosaurs. So we called it Dinosaur Concessions."
His dry-rub barbecue, a Memphis style, was a lip-smacking success. Along with his partner, known universally as Dino, Mr. Stage was soon traveling the East Coast in an old station wagon, towing a pit fashioned from half a 55-gallon oil drum to Harley events.
"We were the Beverly Hillbillies of food," says Mr. Stage, a 33-year-old barbecue maven who says he "reads cookbooks like some people read newspapers."
But he kept returning to Syracuse to have his motorcycle serviced by friends at Andy's Cycle Shop Inc., a dilapidated second-floor Harley-Davidson parts dealership. They pushed him to take over the downstairs restaurant, N & H, a city landmark and traditional shot-and-beer joint whose septuagenarian owners were looking to retire.
"We opened in 1988 and starved for two years," Mr. Stage recalls. "We always said thank God we're in the restaurant business. We thought of closing the doors many times, but we're hardheads."
Three years ago, the Dinosaur installed a bar. Business was soon booming and live blues became a nightly event. Now Mr. Stage is bottling his barbecue sauce and flirting with franchising his restaurant. So far, at least, he's decided against it.
"You lose a little something by expanding," he says. "This is our baby."

HEADLINE: Troubles for Labor;
Legislative Actions in Albany Show Longtime Clout of Unions Is Fading

BYLINE: By JAMES DAO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 19

 BODY:
By passing one bill and killing off another last week, the New York State Legislature sent renewed notice to organized labor that union influence over statehouse politics continues to wane.
Neither action represented a crushing blow to labor, which remains an important player in the Capitol. But viewed in a line of setbacks this year, they suggest Albany that has become less able, or less willing, to deliver for unions. 
 "It's nothing like 20 years ago when the first question in the Assembly was what does labor think," said Norman Adler, a political consultant who works with several unions representing public employees.
Ending what was perhaps the year's most important labor battle, state lawmakers on Thursday passed legislation intended to control the spiraling cost of workers' compensation insurance by requiring some injured workers to seek treatment from managed-care cooperatives. Unions had lobbied furiously against the bill, arguing that it would place workers in the care of company doctors.
 
'They Took a Hit'
 In what struck some as an attempt to paint victory on a canvas of defeat, labor leaders claimed success in diluting portions of the bill, even though their original goal had been to kill it. But many labor loyalists acknowledged in the end that a major fight had been lost.
"The feeling is, yes, they took a hit," said Assemblyman Joseph Crowley, a Queens Democrat who sits on the Labor Committee.
Also on Thursday, negotiators failed to reach agreement on legislation that would have required payment of union wages on most types of publicly financed construction projects. The bill has been a longstanding goal of construction trade unions and, in failing to reach a compromise, the Legislature squandered an opportunity that may not return for years, many labor supporters say.
 
Other Disappointments
 There were other disappointments for labor this year. In September, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo signed legislation intended to give New York City school principals more control over custodians -- a law many unions had protested as an unprecedented violation of collective bargaining.
Last July the Legislature rejected a proposal by the Transport Workers Union for improved pension benefits. And in August Mr. Cuomo vetoed a bill that would have prevented conversations between police officers and their union representatives from being used in criminal investigations.
Labor unions continue to be among the most generous campaign contributors to state elected officials, ranking alongside, and sometimes ahead of, banks, lawyers and doctors.
But the weak economy, declining union membership and disunity within the union movement itself have all contributed to labor's loss of clout in Albany. So has the growing importance of television in political campaigns, a trend that has reduced candidates' dependence on union foot soldiers to get out the vote.
 
Fundamental Changes
 Perhaps more than anything else, labor's misfortunes this year say volumes about fundamental changes in the Democratic-controlled Assembly, long considered labor's house.
Last year Democrats won a record number of seats, 101, in the 150-member Assembly, with most of the new members from rural and suburban districts. Unlike their brethren in the cities, where union membership is highest, the new lawmakers have proved less sympathetic, and sometimes hostile, to labor's concerns.
"The upstate Democrats are more centrist than the traditional downstaters," said Denis M. Hughes, executive assistant to the president of the New York State A.F.L.-C.I.O. "There's more debate today on labor issues in the Democratic conference than in the 20 years I've been following the Legislature."
"Union people," said Assemblyman Crowley, "have been walking around saying, 'Do we have to go to the Senate now to kill bills?' "
Given the State Senate's traditionally close alliance to business, few think that will happen soon. Less clear is the status of labor's relationship with Mr. Cuomo.
 
A Pivotal Role
 In 1982 the A.F.L.-C.I.O. was one of Mr. Cuomo's earliest supporters and played a pivotal role in his unexpected victory over Edward I. Koch in the Democratic primary for governor.
But in recent years Mr. Cuomo has taken positions that have made some labor leaders uneasy, including criticizing New York City's contracts with its unions as too generous, supporting budget-balancing plans that withheld paychecks from state workers and, this year, strongly supporting the workers' compensation bill.
It would appear, some union leaders say, that Mr. Cuomo wants to counter criticism about his stewardship of the state's economy by winning support from business groups, particularly the Business Council, the state's largest business organization.
The Governor pressed several initiatives sought by the council this year, including the workers' compensation bill, legislation that would restrict lawsuits against corporate boards and a bill that would make it more difficult for consumers to win product liability cases.
"He keeps striving for a balance between both business and labor," said Mr. Hughes of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. "And as my father used to say, 'When someone stands in the middle of the road, they usually get run over.' "

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Plotting Fed Rate Move: Yes, but . . . But Then . . .

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
For now it seems that long-term interest rates have seen their lows. But the debate over what the Federal Reserve will do next year, and when it will do it, is picking up.
Most experts think that the yield on the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond has reached its lows for now. Should it somehow breach the 5.78 percent level reached on Oct. 15, a 25-year closing low, such an event would happen far enough into next year for analysts to point to a new set of circumstances to explain the drop -- like an unforeseen decrease in inflation or a lowering of inflationary expectations. 
 As for the Fed, the outlook is unclear. The consensus seems to be that the Fed will push short-term interest rates higher by raising its 3 percent target for Federal funds, a level that has held for more than a year. Estimates are that the funds rate will rise one-quarter to one-half a percentage point. (No change in interest-rate policy is expected when the Fed's policy-making body meets tomorrow.)
But that is where agreement ends. Among those who a rate rise, there is no consensus on the timing -- it could be anywhere from early in the new year to sometime after midyear.
 
A Pre-emptive Strike
 There is also disagreement over how forceful the Fed will be, a debate that has led to speculation about a pre-emptive strike against inflation by the nation's central bank, a favorite theme in the bond market.
One measure of a pre-emptive strike would be how quickly the Fed moved and whether the move was made before there was definitive data showing inflation rising above the 3 percent level of the last two years. Another gauge would be how much the bank raised the Federal funds rate, which is the interest on overnight loans between banks. Two increases over time of one-quarter of a percentage point each would not be as tough as a single increase of one-half of a point early on.
And there are some who said they did not think the Fed would raise short-term rates because, they say, both growth and inflation will remain in check.
Though forecasts of growth and inflation play parts in predicting Fed action, analysts' views of the Fed -- its goals and targets -- color the predictions, too. The fact that the Clinton Administration is about to appoint a new governor to the seven-member board to replace Wayne D. Angell, a hawk on inflation, adds to the debate over the Fed's attitude.
 
Late Move Predicted
 Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns & Company, is forecasting a very late move by the Fed, even though he said he expected the economy to be surprisingly strong early next year, with first-quarter growth of 4 percent, after adjustment for inflation. Other forecasters would see such growth setting off a move by the Fed.
But Mr. Kudlow said he did not expect the Fed to be so tough on inflation because of political pressure and because it "does not want to risk ending this boomlet."
"The Fed's discipline on the margin is eroding right now," he said, "and the President's nominee will add to that erosion" because the likely candidates to fill the Angell vacancy are expected to be growth advocates.
"The Fed," he continued, "will not tighten until they get two or three consecutive C.P.I.'s above 3 percent." And if rises in the Consumer Price Index early next year are temporarily distorted on the high side by seasonal factors, as they have been for the last several years, the Fed will wait even longer, he said.
But John Lipsky, chief economist at Salomon Brothers, said he believed that the Fed and the Clinton Administration had a stronger commitment to controlling inflation. "We think that there are reasons to believe that policy makers will be more serious about inflation," he said of the outlook of Salomon Brothers.
He said the Fed would quickly raise short-term interest rates if the economy was growing at a 3.5 percent pace at the beginning of the year. The Fed, he said, "has to move before the inflation rate has been perceived to have moved up" to maintain its credibility on inflation in the financial markets. This means acting long before the consumer price statistics document a change.
Mr. Lipsky said he did not include inflation, as such, among the factors that would force the Fed to change its policy. Instead, it will be moved by accelerating growth, rising demand for credit and a falling dollar, he said. This means the central bank could raise interest rates even if inflation were still around 3 percent, making this pretty close to a pre-emptive strike, although there was no agreement on the definition.
 
Questions of Pressure
 Mr. Kudlow and Mr. Lipsky also disagreed on how much pressure the Clinton Administration will put on the Fed to keep interest rates from rising. Mr. Kudlow, referring to recent comments by Mr. Clinton, concluded that the Administration did not want the Fed to increase rates, especially with inflation at such a low level.
Mr. Lipsky, noting remarks from other Administration officials, concluded that the President would accept a moderate increase in short-term interest rates if that would help calm worries about inflation and keep long-term rates from rising. Low long-term interest rates are an important source of economic stimulus the Administration has working for it.
Allen Sinai, chief economist at Lehman Brothers, predicted that the Fed would not raise rates any time soon. Commenting on the possibility of a pre-emptive strike and the leanings of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, Mr. Sinai said: "If they did it this time around, it would be the first time in history. I think Greenspan is too traditional." Of the economy, he said, "There is nothing in growth and inflation to get the Fed to move."

HEADLINE: Split Over Rates Ends Clinton-Fed Honeymoon

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 19

 BODY:
It was sweet for 11 months, but the honeymoon between President Clinton and the Federal Reserve has finally come to an end.
The beginning of the end came with bickering over the President's proposal to have just one agency regulate the nation's banks, a move that would take away some of the Federal Reserve's power. And now it seems President Clinton could sue for divorce if the central bank raises interest rates early next year to fight inflation, as some rumblings from within the Fed suggest. 
 The Clinton Administration is delighted that the economy has finally started to advance, and the last thing it wants is for the Fed to slow it down by raising rates. But Administration officials cannot hide their fears that the Federal Reserve will raise rates to make sure that inflation does not surge.
 
Not If, but When and How Much
 "The real question is not whether interest rates go up, but when and how much," said Frank Newman, Under Secretary of the Treasury for Domestic Finance.
Last week Mr. Clinton was so worried that the Fed might sabotage his promise of stronger growth that he engaged in some unusually outspoken jawboning, saying, "There's no indication that we're facing a return of inflation." He added that until the economy produced "some real threat of inflation it would be inappropriate for us to choke off an economy that has already had a false start or two" since the 1990-91 recession ended.
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen joined the jawboning today by saying that with the economy growing at a 3 percent annual rate and inflation low, he saw no need for the Fed to push up interest rates.
"I don't see it in the current quarter or the next quarter," Mr. Bentsen said on the NBC News program "Meet the Press."
In recent interviews and speeches, Federal Reserve officials indicated that they would not approve an immediate rate increase when the central bank's main policy-making committee met Tuesday.
 
No Alarm Bells Heard
 "I don't see anything at the moment that sends alarm bells ringing about inflation," John P. LaWare, a Fed governor, said in an interview last week.
Even though inflation continues to slide, these officials signaled that they might push to raise rates before long in response to the recent surge in economic growth. The Fed's governors seem to have a predisposition that makes them fear that inflationary pressures will burst forth as soon as economic growth blossoms.
"We seem to have a lot of growth out there, which should make us a bit cautious," the Fed's vice chairman, David W. Mullins Jr., said at a conference of the American Enterprise Institute this month. "Once you can see clearly visible signs that inflationary pressures are embedded, it seems awfully late in the game" to act to stop inflation.
He suggested that the central bank's short-term interest rates were so low that they could overstimulate the economy and reignite inflation, although he acknowledged that Pentagon cutbacks and high debt burdens were holding back growth.
Mr. Mullins signaled that he did not support an immediate rate increase, saying, "There is no compelling evidence at this time that inflationary pressures are building."
The Fed is getting contradictory signals from two statistics it watches closely as harbingers of economywide inflation -- unit labor costs, which are declining, and commodity prices, which are inching up.
In an interview, Lawrence B. Lindsey, a Fed governor, read the tea leaves this way: "The inflation genie is in the bottle, but the cork isn't on the bottle." A likely translation: As soon as the genie starts to stir, the Fed will rush to recork the bottle.
The Administration fears that if the Fed raises short-term rates it would weaken the interest-sensitive sectors that are the only engines of growth: housing, business investment and big-ticket durable items, like cars. But the Fed view is that if it increases short-term rates, then the rates it views as key to sustaining growth -- long-term rates -- should stay low because the bond market would see the Fed's commitment to smother inflation.
Several Administration officials said in private that they could accept an increase of one-fourth of a percent in short-term rates once inflationary pressures materialized. But anything more than that would make them uncomfortable, they said.
Economists are divided on how soon and how vigorously the Fed will act.
Predicting that the Fed could raise rates next month, David M. Jones, chief economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a New York brokerage, said the Fed would aggressively push up its main short-term interest rate, currently 3 percent, to 3.75 percent by April and 4.5 percent by next December. The Federal funds rate is the rate banks charge one another on overnight loans.
"What the Fed wants is a soft takeoff," he said, adding that Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, "believes that if he waits till he sees the whites of the eyes of inflation, it will be too late."
"His case to the White House will be a stitch in time saves nine," Mr. Jones said.
David Munro, a Fed watcher at High Frequency Economics, a consulting firm, expects Mr. Greenspan to act far more gingerly because of his cautious personality. Mr. Munro predicted that the Fed would wait until March or April to pull the trigger because it would first want to see how strong first-quarter growth was. His forecast: the Fed will lift the Federal funds rate to 3.5 percent by next December.
"They will act only when there is a fairly strong sign of acceleration in inflationary pressures," he said. "They know Congress will come after them very uncomfortably if there isn't a very solid case.'
Nowadays Mr. Greenspan feels caught in a vise between the two houses of Congress.
 
More Political Control Sought
 Representative Henry B. Gonzalez, Democrat of Texas, the chairman of the House Banking Committee, wants to assert more political control over the Fed by giving the President, rather than private bankers, the power to name the presidents of its 12 regional banks. Those presidents hold 5 of the 12 seats on the Fed's main policy-making committee and the Federal Reserve Board's 7 governors hold the rest. To Fed officials, the Gonzalez plan is a blatant attempt to cripple their independence.
As for the Senate, Fed officials may be rejoicing about the decision by a veteran Fed basher, Donald W. Riegle Jr., the Michigan Democrat who heads the Senate Banking Committee, not to run for re-election. But they can scarcely be encouraged by the man likely to replace him as committee chairman, Paul Sarbanes, a Maryland Democrat who is a more articulate Fed critic than Mr. Riegle.
With an eye to the 1994 elections, Mr. Sarbanes has already warned the Fed that he and other lawmakers are in no mood for higher rates. In a sharply worded letter to Mr. Greenspan, Mr. Sarbanes and Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who heads the Senate Budget Committee, said it was "incomprehensible" that the central bank would consider tightening monetary policy "despite the absence of inflationary pressures."
They added that "it would be a tragedy to jeopardize the current" economic expansion.
Behind the Fed's marble walls, the big worry is that if the central bankers anger Mr. Clinton, he might support Mr. Gonzalez's proposals. Until now, many economists say, Mr. Clinton has tried to build good will with the Fed by maintaining that he treasures its independence and that, at least for now, he does not back Mr. Gonzalez's proposals.
Fed officials say they are pleased that relations are better with the Clinton Administration than with the Bush Administration. The situation grew so tense over the Fed's failure to cut rates as fast as former Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady wanted that he and Mr. Greenspan broke off their weekly breakfasts.
Clinton Administration officials say a rate rise will not mean an end to Mr. Greenspan's tennis matches or weekly meetings with Mr. Bentsen.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Magazines Create On-Line Salons

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
Ever on the lookout for new readers, the magazine industry seems to have hit paydirt. It has discovered electronic publishing.
Almost 100 magazines have signed up with on-line computer services in the last six months and others are joining at the rate of two or three a week. At the same time, a sigh of relief is sweeping the industry because the availability of on-line magazines does not seem to be hurting traditional subscriptions and newsstand sales. 
 "Very few people read text on-line; it's not that much fun," said Jonathan Bulkeley, general manager for media at America Online, one of the leading electronic publishing services. "It's not as compelling as a magazine."
The real popularity of electronic magazines, in fact, has little to do with reading and everything to do with talking. And talking and talking and talking.
 
Opinions Galore
 Subscribers to on-line services are conversing electronically with magazines ranging from Time and Omni to Consumer Reports and Disney Adventures. Many users are offering gripes, praise and advice to editors and writers. Others are scanning electronic bulletin boards for magazine-sponsored discussion sessions, in which they direct questions to everyone from the Rev. Billy Graham to Vice President Al Gore. They are also participating in on-line forums, arguing vehemently about ethics and violence and politics.
"It is like a gold rush," said James Gleick, founder of the Pipeline, a New York-based link to the Internet, a global computer network. "Everybody is suddenly realizing that this world exists and that it is filled with interesting, intelligent, text-oriented people -- and suddenly everyone wants to be there."
All it takes is a computer, a modem and a telephone line. The three major on-line services -- the Prodigy Services Company, with 2 million members; Compuserve, with 1.5 million, and America Online Inc., with 500,000 -- charge less than $15 a month for basic service with some additional fees for extras. America Online, for instance, has a basic monthly fee of $9.95 for the first five hours and $3.50 an hour after that.
The cost to publishers is scant. They are responsible for supplying text, making editors available at specified times for on-line discussions and publishing promotional materials in their magazines encouraging readers to sign up for the services. In return, publishers get a fee every time users call up their magazines electronically or participate in one of their events.
 
Extending a Magazine's Reach
 For a magazine, of course, the biggest benefit may be the potential new audience.
"We're just kind of feeling our way and trying to produce something on-line that is an extension of the magazine," said Kimberly Smith Jensen, senior vice president of The Atlantic Monthly, which signed up with America Online last month. "We are not interested in duplicating what is in the magazine per se. What really drew us is the interactivity."
She said magazine officials were "overwhelmed" by the responses, which have included hundreds of electronic letters and messages.
James Fallows, the Washington editor of The Atlantic Monthly, said he exchanges dozens of letters with readers each day.
"It does help revive what is thought to be a dying art, namely that of letter writing," he said. "But it's much quicker than the usual form of letters to the editor, more participatory."
 
50,000 Responses a Week
 Philip Elmer-DeWitt, an associate editor at Time magazine, said that since Time Online began in September, users have called it up an average of 50,000 to 60,000 times a week. When Kurt Andersen, an editor at large at the magazine, went on-line to talk about his cover article on radio personalities Rush Limbaugh and Howard Stern, 114 users signed up for a lively session. About 300 joined Mr. Graham for an hourlong session after Time's cover article about him.
After U.S. News & World Report made its debut on Compuserve on Nov. 29, users called up the magazine's text, graphics and photographs more than 90,000 times during the next 13 days. Doug Stanglin, the magazine's Moscow bureau chief, even engaged in an electronic discussion in Russian about the new Russian Constitution.
The marketing potential for on-line magazines is still unclear. Mr. Elmer-DeWitt said Time Online was bringing in relatively few new subscribers to the magazine itself. But Jeffrey L. Dearth, president of The New Republic, said that when his magazine went on-line in November 1992, an electronic offer for subscriptions drew about 300 responses.
With that in mind, Mr. Dearth organized the Electronic Newsstand on the Internet in July with 10 magazines, including The New Yorker, The Economist, National Review and Eating Well. More than 60 magazines have signed up, and Internet users worldwide are using the service an average of 20,000 times a day. "We are definitely selling magazines," he said.
The next frontier of on-line services may be advertising. Prodigy, currently the only advertiser-supported network, sometimes runs ads across the bottom of the PC screen; users can call up more information about the products.
 
The Timing of Text
 As electronic publishing expands,publishers are debating the value of putting the full text of their magazines on-line. Time and U.S. News offer full electronic texts before the printed magazines are available on newsstands. Disney Adventures does them one better and puts its text on-line a week ahead of time "to give the kids a feeling that they are part of this special little club," Tommi Lewis, editor in chief, said.
Another approach is taken by Omni, a monthly science magazine, which puts a sampler of its articles on-line the day it hits the newsstands. But it does not make the full text available electronically until the day the magazine comes off the stands.
"Basically we are using the on-line environment to encourage the kind of discussion, explication and investigation of ideas and topics that Omni is most famous for," Keith Ferrell, editorial director, said.
Consumer Reports first went on-line in 1982 and is now available on five services.
"Our mission is to get the information out to the consumers, and we feel that electronic publishing provides us a way to reach the greatest number of them," Thomas Falconer, who is in charge of Consumer Reports' electronic publishing, said. "And it has not affected the sales of the magazine."

HEADLINE: A Smart Move by United

 BODY:
The tentative agreement by United Airlines to sell a majority stake of the carrier to its employees is an attractive solution to a seemingly unsolvable financial problem. Indeed, it could spread to the other major carriers and beyond.
Over the last three years, as the economy has sagged, airline carriers have lost more than $10 billion; United alone has lost more than $1 billion. A major problem is that the large carriers, like United, Delta and American, carry huge debt and other fixed costs that don't go away when business falls off. No matter how few passengers United carries, it still must pay interest to creditors and run its gargantuan hub-and-spoke operations. 
 That makes the major carriers easy prey to strike threats. Management knows that if the pilots walked away from their jobs, the airlines would go bankrupt quickly. Desperate to stay afloat, the airlines have entered labor contracts they can't afford. The situation worsened when upstart carriers, like Southwest, relying on cheap labor and flexible work rules to fly only short-haul routes, began to siphon away United's customers.
The salvation of United lies in cutting its labor costs. That means lower pay. It also means looser work rules so that United can staff planes and airports with fewer workers. But the pilots and machinists, distrusting that they would ever see the benefit, were not about to offer massive wage cuts for nothing. That's why Stephen Wolf, the head of United, entered negotiations for a worker buyout. If it happens, United will become the largest worker-controlled company in the U.S.
Under the tentative agreement, the unions agree to sizable cuts in wages and fringe benefits. The labor savings are expected to exceed $5 billion over six years. In return, the unions will get 53 percent ownership of the airline. Worker control can scare investors who fear that worker-owners would rush to steer revenues into bloated wages rather than dividends or investment. So the unions wisely agreed to appoint only a minority of the board; they would, in effect, retain veto power over many important corporate decisions.
The United deal demonstrates that workers will absorb steep wage cuts only if they are guaranteed benefits down the road. Worker control provides that guarantee. Workers are given an immediate stake in the company's long-term future: wage concessions are immediately translated into stock shares, which stay in an employee stock ownership fund until the worker retires or otherwise leaves the company. And if further wage cuts are needed in the future, worker-owners are unlikely to resort to a bankrupting strike.
Worker-controlled companies have an uneven record of success in the U.S. But many of the failures were preordained, because the companies were at death's door before they were turned over to employees; despite recent losses, United's future isn't bleak. Besides, other worker-controlled companies were not designed to give workers a healthy incentive to watch the company's bank account as closely as their own.
If worker-ownership succeeds at United, it could also solve identical problems at American and Delta. Indeed, other industries forced to meet global competition by restructuring their work forces might gravitate toward the same solution.

HEADLINE: Welfare Recipients Are Victims, Not Criminals;
Abolish the System

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The case for a school-to-work program, which is outlined in "America's Job Disaster," Bob Herbert's column of Dec. 1, is persuasive. Certainly, society needs to do much more to help put today's youth into the jobs of the future.
But is in-school training the answer? The best training ground available is the school of employment; yet our inner-city youth shun the entry-level jobs that offer them a step up into the world of work. Why? Because earnings are effectively wiped out by benefit reductions, making crime and welfare the economy of choice for the urban ghetto. 
 A very straightforward solution exists. Abolish welfare and use the money saved to provide a refundable tax credit for all our citizens. Closing down the welfare system would produce enough saving in bureaucracy and misplaced benefits to finance complete antipoverty protection for all of our citizens.
More important, abolishing the welfare-work disincentive would free the poor to become more productive, thus adding to our national wealth and competitivenes. In time, the failed war on poverty would be replaced by economic growth and productivity.

HEADLINE: 'Prevailing Wage' Bill Threatens Public Works

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The innovative housing development proposed for the Hunters Point section of Queens will fail if the "prevailing wage" pending in Albany is passed. It would vastly expand the definition of public works projects subject to extraordinarily high wage rates and unreasonable work practices. The Hunters Point project would fall under this definition and so would most housing and economic development projects in New York.
No one can object to reasonable working wages for our construction trades, but even nonunion workers in New York City earn more than their union counterparts in Jersey City. No wonder New York is losing its competitive edge, encouraging the exodus of jobs and business. 
 Such a law would doom affordable housing production. But more is at stake. If the prevailing wage bill passes the Assembly, most housing and economic development projects will be killed, along with any hope for this city's economic revival.
Mayor David N. Dinkins (along with other elected officials) has an opportunity to leave a lasting legacy of economic revival for New York City by strenuously objecting to the pending legislation.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Picks Dinkins Aide As Housing Commissioner

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani yesterday named Deborah C. Wright as Commissioner of the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development. Ms. Wright, now a board member of the New York City Housing Authority, is the first black to be appointed to a high-level post in the new administration and the first official from the Dinkins administration to join the Giuliani team.
In other appointments, Mr. Giuliani is expected today to name his team to lead the Health and Hospitals Corporation, which runs the city's municipal hospitals. Dr. Bruce Siegel, Health Commissioner under Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey, is the Mayor-elect's choice to be the corporation president, according to an adviser to Mr. Giuliani, and Luis Miranda of the Hispanic Federation of New York City is in line to be chairman.
It was not clear last night when Mr. Giuliani hoped to see Dr. Siegel assume his new duties. The current president, Billy E. Jones, has a contract that runs through the spring.
 
Strongly Recommended
 In announcing the housing appointment yesterday, Mr. Giuliani brushed off a question as to whether he has had difficulty attracting black candidates for posts in his administration. 
 "The fact is that it has not been difficult to elicit nominees," said Mr. Giuliani, "and in each case, each selection is a different process. In Deborah's case, she was strongly recommended by the selection committee and if you look at her background and her qualifications, she is clearly the best qualified person to do this job."
Earlier in the day, Mr. Giuliani appeared at a Brooklyn meeting on racial and ethnic relations, where he stressed that he wants to be responsive to all New Yorkers. "I understand that it is my job to reach out to every single community in this city," he said, adding that it was important for people to understand "that we are completely united as New Yorkers."
Mr. Giuliani's new Housing Commissioner is a 35-year-old lawyer and Crown Heights resident who has worked for Mayor David N. Dinkins since 1990. She was a City Planning Commission member from 1990 until August 1992, when she was appointed to the Housing Authority board. In that post, she was responsible for overseeing new construction and major rehabilitation of housing projects.
 
Time to 'Pull Together'
 Ms. Wright said she accepted the Giuliani appointment because she believed "it was a time for the city to pull together" and agreed with many of Mr. Giuliani's housing positions.
Mr. Giuliani has given little indication of what his housing policies will be, except to say he wants to substantially reduce the city's responsiblity for 40,000 apartments in buildings taken for nonpayment of taxes.
Yesterday Ms. Wright said she supported the goal of returning to private owners some of the buildings owned by the city. "Its one thing if you are spending a large amount of money and are providing adequate services," she said. "But if you are spending a large amount of money and services are not adequate, its time to re-evaluate the program."
Francine C. Justa, executive director of Neighborhood Housing Services, a private, nonprofit housing agency that helps to arrange private financing for single and multi-family housing, was among the housing advocates who said the appointment of Ms. Wright was a good one.
"Debbie is a talented and energetic woman," Mrs. Justa said. "But she faces a difficult challenge on the fiscal side. Money is going to be tight."
Ms. Wright will be taking over an agency with a $1 billion annual budget and 3,500 employees. She will replace Felice L. Michetti, who is credited with seeing that the city kept on track with fulfilling a 1986 pledge by former Mayor Edward I. Koch to add at least 47,000 apartments for low-income people before the mid-1990's.
Ms. Wright was born in Bennettsville, S.C. and grew up in Dallas. Her father, the Rev. Harry S. Wright, and her mother, Joan, now live in Brooklyn, where her father used to be pastor of the Cornerstone Baptist Church in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Ms. Wright, who is single, received her B.A. degree from Radcliffe College in 1979. In 1984 she receieved an M.B.A. and law degree from Harvard University.

HEADLINE: Giuliani Adviser Seeks Agencies' Plans for Cuts

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER

 BODY:
In a preliminary effort to confront projected city budget shortfalls, Mayor-elect Rudolph W. Giuliani's chief fiscal adviser has asked most city agencies to begin preparing scenarios for cutting their budgets by 5 percent and by 10 percent next year.
The request and the response from the agencies, due by Jan. 1, is an exercise and does not indicate that Mr. Giuliani and his designated budget director, Abraham M. Lackman, have made any specific decisions on how they will deal with a budget gap of at least $1.7 billion for the next fiscal year, which begins in July. 
 "The importance of the letter is to send a strong signal that this Mayor expects to deal with the '95 problem almost immediately," Mr. Lackman said in an interview last night. The request, which did not ask for cuts in Medicaid, welfare or city debt service, is just the first step in the planning process, he said.
But the order to begin planning for spending reductions -- in a memo written at Mr. Lackman's request by the current budget director, Carol O'Cleireacain -- may reflect some priorities Mr. Giuliani will bring to fiscal planning after he takes office.
For example, the Board of Education and City University of New York were exempted from having to propose budget cuts, according to the memo, written on Friday and made public yesterday. The Police Department was asked to find ways to cut spending 5 percent for next year; it was not also required to devise a plan for trimming by 10 percent next year.
 
To Offer Different Choices
 The heads of virtually all other city agencies were told to prepare plans for cutting spending by 5 percent and by 10 percent next year. They were also instructed to propose ways to cut 1 percent from their budgets during the last six months of the current fiscal year -- savings that are supposed to translate into an additional 2 percent in spending reductions when applied to the next fiscal year.
Mr. Giuliani said during the campaign that he would try to spare agencies serving children from budget cuts and to protect agencies already hit hard by spending reductions in the last four years. But some of the agencies trimmed most during the Dinkins administration, including the Departments of Parks and Housing Preservation, were not exempted from Mr. Lackman's requests.
 
First Priority
 Ms. O'Cleireacain told agency heads that their first priority should be to cut spending without reducing services. "This means that productivity, doing the same with less, is absolutely crucial," she wrote. She also requested detailed plans to reduce spending on overtime. She asked agency heads to devise ways to collect 10 percent more in revenues than they do now on uncollected fines, fees and rents, and to analyze how spending cuts might affect city services.
In a related development, City Comptroller Elizabeth Holtzman said the city's economy appears to have begun a very modest recovery from the recession that began in 1989.
She also suggested ways to close next year's budget gap, which she estimated at $2 billion. Among these, the city could save $366 million a year, she said, by improving how it collects unpaid taxes, fees and fines, and it could save as much as $300 million a year by contracting out for goods and services more efficiently.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises On Trendless Trading Day

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks closed mixed after an opening selloff yesterday, as trading moved in a trendless fashion familiar to the end of the year.
Traders said the mood of the market included some optimism about inflation, which appeared to be controlled under the Fed's watchful gaze, and greater optimism about corporate profits. 
 The Dow Jones industrial average gained 3.64 points on the day to close at 3,755.21 in moderate trading, as volume on the New York Stock Exchange totaled 255.9 million shares.
Rao Chalasani, the chief investment strategist for Kemper Securities Group in Chicago, characterized yesterday's trading session as directionless, with low volume compared with a rally on Friday when the trading volume was 363.75 million shares. But he said that rally was related to the "triple witch" expiration of option and index futures.
Mr. Chalasani said bonds, a source from which stocks have often drawn strength, sagged a little yesterday.
 
Defining New Range
 "The bond market, which saw its high in October, is now trying to define a new trading range," he said. "Even though we expect 1994 operational earnings to be up 10 to 12 percent, interest-rate increases do not leave much room for the stock market to perform well."
As the rates climb higher, they offer investors another alternative to equities. For now, Mr. Chalasani said he thought the stock market would mark time with a continued movement sideways.
Yesterday, declining stocks outpaced those showing gains by 1,125 to 990. And the Big Board composite slipped by 0.20 point, to 257.59, while less-than-active trading lifted the Nasdaq composite by 0.92 point to close at 760.15.
Continental Medical Systems, which claims to be the largest provider of medical rehabilitation in the country, fell 1 1/4, to 8, after the company said it anticipated second-quarter earnings to be below analysts' expectations, largely because of the underperformance of its California rehabilitation hospitals and soft demand in the temporary physician-replacement market.
 
Agreement in China
 Qualcomm Inc. rose 1 7/8, to 57 7/8. The maker of digital wire communications technology said it had signed an agreement with China to field-test the company's digital cellular technology.
The stock of TJ International, a building materials company, rose 3/4, to 28 1/8, after Goldman, Sachs upgraded its recommendation to "trading buy" from "moderate outperformer." The brokerage firm gave the stock a target price of $31 a share.
Storage Technology declined 7/8, to 32 1/8. Traders attributed the drop to an article in Barron's in which a money manager who had sold the stock short said he believed the stock would drop to 20.
A report in The Wall Street Journal that the directors of Borden were considering putting the company up for sale drove up the share price of the food and plastics conglomerate by 5/8, to 18 5/8. Analysts said the biggest obstacle to selling Borden outright was that it was a collection of unrelated businesses, and most of them were not doing well.
 
Advice to Buy
 Shares of Wells Fargo rose 3 5/8, to 128 3/4, after Ray Soifer, an analyst for Brown Brothers Harriman, raised his 1994 earnings projections to $14 a share, from $12, with a preliminary 1995 estimate of $15.25 a share. Traders said he had advised clients to buy the stock on weakness.
Talk that Merck & Company was accelerating the work on a promising experimental AIDS treatment made the stock of the drug maker the most actively traded issue on the Big Board. It closed up 1/4, at 33 7/8.
Timberland made a technical rebound yesterday after falling 31 percent last week when investors grew concerned that its fourth-quarter earnings would be lower than expected. Yesterday the stock rose 2 3/8, to 52 1/8, on no news.
Shares of Champion Industries rose 1 1/2, to 18 1/4, after it said its fourth-quarter net income had risen to 19 cents a share, compared with 12 cents a year ago. The printer and supplier of office supplies also declared a 5-for-4 stock split.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises Against Yen On Talk of Rate Cut in Japan

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar rose against the Japanese yen yesterday amid speculation about a near-term cut in Japan's official discount rate, but it weakened against some other currencies.
Dealers suspect Japan may announce a rate cut in tandem with its new economic pump-priming package, which could be made public this week. Japanese Government officials have said the plan is unlikely to include details on specific spending and income tax cuts. 
 "The market is pricing in a rate cut immediately," said Christopher Wilson of Union Bank in Los Angeles.
 In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 110.62 yen, from 110.19 on Friday.
 
Rates Already Low
 A Bank of Japan official said early yesterday that interest rates were already low and that the central bank saw no reason for additional monetary measures. But dealers said Japan's short-term money market rates were hovering just above the 1.75 percent official discount rate, suggesting that the official rate would soon be cut by one-quarter point, to 1.5 percent.
Analysts have been expecting Japan's Government to provide monetary stimulus partly to revive the recently battered stock market.
Gold prices also rose. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for February delivery, the most active futures contract, gained $1.90, to $390.80 an ounce.
The German mark was also in demand among yen holders -- helping the mark hold ground against the dollar. Resistance at the key 1.72-mark level also kept a lid on the dollar against the mark, although the dollar managed to squeeze out gains on the mark. It rose to 1.7130 German marks in New York, from 1.7075 late Friday.
The Canadian dollar fell to six-year lows, following up last week's late selling. On Friday, Standard & Poor's said the debt of some Canadian provinces could be downgraded in the future. The Bank of Canada reportedly bought Canadian dollars for American dollars to stem the slide. The American dollar closed at $1.3450 (Canadian) in New York, up from $1.3405 on Friday.
The British pound closed in New York at $1.4860, down from $1.4875 late Friday.
Other late dollar rates, compared with Friday's quotes, included: 1.4580 Swiss francs, down from 1.4590; 5.8370 French francs, up from 5.8360, and 1,675 Italian lire, down from 1,685.

HEADLINE: U.S. IS ABANDONING 'SHOCK THERAPY' FOR THERUSSIANS

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration's top Russia specialist said today that the surprisingly large support for foes of reform in Russia's parliamentary elections last week showed that there had been too much emphasis on remaking the economy of Russia and not enough on improving the daily lives of its people.
Strobe Talbott, the State Department's Ambassador at Large for Russia and other countries of the former Soviet Union, also said the United States was looking to other Russian reformers as well as President Boris N. Yeltsin to bring change to the troubled country, even if they were Mr. Yeltsin's political enemies.
 
'Shock Therapy' Has Failed
 While Mr. Talbott was characteristically cautious and noncommittal, his remarks illuminated an important shift in official American thinking: an admission, in effect, that the "shock therapy," the-faster-the-better approach to reform advocated by the West -- and until recently by Mr. Yeltsin -- has not worked. 
 In the first on-the-record admission that Washington is rethinking its strategy on Russia, Mr. Talbott acknowledged that the Administration had begun "intensive deliberations" on "refining, focusing and intensifying our reform support efforts" to take account of the election results.
The goal, Mr. Talbott added, is to find a way for "less shock and more therapy for the Russian people."
Secretary of State Warren Christopher sounded the same theme in a meeting with reporters in New York tonight, The Associated Press reported. Saying the vote should be taken as a "wake-up call" by reformers, Mr. Christopher said he hoped they would "be very conscious of the pain that takes place in the transition" from Communism to capitalism.
 
Speedy Reform Encouraged
 Although the United States and the other Western nations have little direct influence on Russian politics, they have encouraged the speedy pace of reform by tying loans from the International Monetary Fund to the pace of economic change.
Worried about Russia's huge budget deficit and high inflation rate, the I.M.F. has adhered to a strict lending policy, calling for action on those fronts before money would be handed over. As a result, the fund has lent Russia only half of a promised $3 billion, a situation criticized last week in Moscow by Vice President Al Gore, who said the I.M.F.'s board was not sensitive enough to the hardships the Russian people faced.
While Mr. Talbott was careful not to criticize the I.M.F. or call directly for a change in its policy, changing the pace of reform would require some loosening of the fund's standards.
Mr. Talbott also said the Administration was considering the expansion of a strong social "safety net" for the Russian people, but he either was unable or unwilling to say where the money would come from. Other officials were quick to insist that the United States would not go beyond the $2.5 billion it has already set aside for the nations of the former Soviet Union for next year.
Projects that would have a direct effect on ordinary Russians would most likely require an injection of aid from the World Bank, the I.M.F. or the international community.
Other senior officials have said that neither the United States nor the rest of the international community has the money or the desire to bail out Russia, knowing that much of the money would not be repaid. For their part, Russian officials want the money to come in grants, not loans.
"To create a huge social safety net would be very expensive, and we don't have the money," a senior Administration official told reporters after a formal briefing at the White House last week. "There is no collection of countries that can do that."
But one clear implication of Mr. Talbott's remarks was that the United States might be willing to endorse a slower approach to reform if that meant meeting the everyday needs of the Russian people and thus steeringthem away from the far left or far right who offer bread instead of statistics.
 
A Safety Net
 Some officials hope that Russia can push ahead with privatizations and other changes as fast as before if a sizable safety net is stitched together.
The comments by Mr. Talbott reflected the sobering effect last week's vote totals have had on the Administration and particularly on him. Until a few days before the election, he, like many other Russia experts in the Government, dismissed suggestions that the Russian people would choose a Parliament that the United States could not wholehearedly embrace.
By contrast, in analyzing the unexpectedly strong showing by the far-right party of Vladimir Zhirinovsky, Mr. Talbott said today that there was no question the Russian people "were sending a message to their leadership, and their message was that reform, as it has been carried out to date, has been accompanied by a lot of disruption, a lot of disorder and a lot of hardship for the average Russian citizen."
He refrained from repeating past Administration appeals to reform as fast as possible, describing the Administration's current view in different terms. "It might be a mistake to cast it in terms of fast and slow," he said, adding, "Rather than thinking of it in terms of slowing reform down, I would say it's more a concept of broadening the concept of reform."
In explaining what he meant by the "broadening" of reform, Mr. Talbott said, "Rather than focusing just on the economic indicators, which are important and which will remain important -- economic indicators such as inflation rates, levels of credit emissions to large state enterprises and that kind of thing -- they and we also have to factor into our policies the social factors, which you might call the misery index -- unemployment, people's sense of being afraid on the streets, being afraid of the future -- that kind of thing."
Mr. Talbott argued that the Yeltsin Government must adopt measures to ease the effect of the transformation from Communism to capitalism and that advisers of Mr. Clinton were preparing specific recommendations for his summit meeting with Mr. Yeltsin in Moscow in January.
 
Balance Is Needed
 "There is going to have to be a balance between the economic imperatives and also the political imperatives of keeping Russia on the path toward democratization and economic reform," Mr. Talbott said in briefing reporters today after his trip to Russia and other parts of the former Soviet Union with Vice President Gore.
Jeffrey Sachs, an Harvard economist who advises the Yeltsin Government, said in a telephone interview from Switzerland that if $4 billion to $5 billion could be added to a social safety net, it would "go far, but not go all the way." He added, "It's not enough to say, as I fear they'll say, 'Oh, we'll add $1 billion or $2 billion to a safety net.' That will be received with the same zero credibility as much of the aid that has been received so far."
Mr. Sachs said money for a safety net might come from the World Bank, which has already lent $60 million for such social services and is considering an additional $500 million.

Constitution Approved
 MOSCOW, Dec. 20 (Reuters) -- Russia's new Constitution has been formally approved by a majority of voters after a referendum this month and will go into effect Tuesday, the Central Electoral Commission said today.
An electoral spokesman said final official results showed 54.8 percent of Russia's 106,170,335 eligible voters took part in the referendum. Of those who voted, 58.4 were in favor of the new Constitution and 41.6 against it.

HEADLINE: Kiev Acts Quickly on Pledge To Disarm Nuclear Weapons

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
Ukraine's President has told President Clinton that Kiev is prepared to deactivate its nuclear arsenal, including its entire force of modern SS-24 missiles, Clinton Administration officials said today.
The assurance was conveyed last month by President Leonid Kravchuk in a telephone conversation with Mr. Clinton, the officials said. 
 And in a gesture of good faith, Ukrainian officials announced today that they had removed the warheads from 17 of its 46 SS-24 missiles, the most modern weapons in their nuclear arsenal.
"Seventeen missiles have been deactivated," Deputy Prime Minister Valery Shmarov said today, referring to the SS-24's. "There will be 20 by the end of the year. This means lowering the level of military alert. The warheads have been moved away from the launchers."
 
'Crossed a Threshold'
 Some Clinton Administration officials called this move encouraging. "They have crossed a threshold in terms of the declaration of intent," one senior Administration official said.
But other Administration officials were more cautious. Some noted that although Mr. Kravchuk did not specify any conditions when he told Mr. Clinton that he was prepared to deactivate Ukraine's entire nuclear arsenal, Mr. Shmarov told reporters that Ukraine would not deactivate all its SS-24's unless a satisfactory agreement was worked out providing economic compensation and security assurances to Kiev.
"We are prepared to remove all SS-24's from military alert, but only if conditions discussed at these talks are fulfilled," Mr. Shmarov said.
 
Problem for Relations
 The nuclear weapons Ukraine has inherited have been a major stumbling block for arms control and for American relations with the Kiev Government. When the Soviet Union broke up, Ukraine inherited the SS-24's, 130 SS-19 missiles and 564 air-launched cruise missiles, according to the Arms Control Association, a private group.
Neither of the strategic arms reduction treaties concluded during the Bush Administration can formally be put into effect until Kiev agrees to relinquish its nuclear arms. But unlike Belarus and Kazakhstan, which have agreed to give up the nuclear weapons they inherited, Ukraine has been reluctant to part with its arsensal. It is dismantling 20 of the older SS-19 missiles, but it had previously declined to dismantle the SS-24's, which have 10 warheads each.
Kiev's disarmament efforts have brought a tart response from the Clinton Administration, which has declined to schedule meetings between Mr. Kravchuk and President Clinton. Mr. Clinton called Mr. Kravchuk two weeks ago to complain about Ukraine's arms-control policies. At the time it was reported that Mr. Kravchuk said only that he would ask the Ukrainian Parliament to reconsider its refusal to eliminate all of the country's nuclear missiles in accordance with the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty.
The Clinton Administration has been involved in three-way negotiations to encourage the Ukraine not only to deactivate its nuclear arsenal but also to return the warheads to Russia so that they can be dismantled.
Under the arrangement being negotiated, Ukraine would remove its warheads from its missiles and store them temporarily on its territory, perhaps under international supervision. It would then return the warheads to Russia. In return, Kiev would receive low enriched uranium for its nuclear power plants, as well as closer diplomatic and military ties with Washington.
"It is not a done deal yet, but there is reason to be hopeful," an Administration official said.
 
Energy Crisis in Ukraine
 While Ukraine is concerned about the possibility of Russian aggression, it is also under severe economic pressures. Ukraine has a severe energy crisis this winter. Many regions cope with daily electrical brownouts, while in Kiev factories run on a rotation basis to economize.
Kiev has a $2.5 billion debt for the oil and natural gas supplied by Russia. The low enriched uranium Ukraine would receive in compensation for its warheads would reduce Ukraine's reliance on Russian energy imports.
Ukraine is also seeking discounts on gas and oil from Russia for the more than 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons it has already returned to Russia.

HEADLINE: ARISTIDE IS URGED TO BACK PREMIER

BYLINE: By STEVEN A. HOLMES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21

 BODY:
With their drive to restore President Jean-Betrand Aristide to power at a virtual standstill, diplomats met with the Haitian leader today to urge him to show flexibility in reaching a solution to his country's political crisis.
Diplomats from the United States, France, Canada, Venezuela and the United Nations met with Father Aristide for more than three hours, but participants said later that he did not give them a commitment that he would support a new plan to end Haiti's political crisis. 
 Even as diplomats sought promises from Father Aristide, President Clinton increased the pressure, publicly appealing to him and to others to show some flexibility. "We're going to take another run at it and see if we can do something on it," Mr. Clinton said today. "It's going to require some flexibility on all sides."
 
Words of Frustration
 United States officials and Robert Malval, the Haitian businessman whom Father Aristide appointed Prime Minister, have expressed frustration with Father Aristide for withdrawing his backing for talks aimed at resuscitating the stalled Governors Island accords.
Those accords, named after the island in New York Harbor where they were signed in July, were supposed to lead to Father Aristide's reinstatement on Oct. 30, but they have been ignored by Haiti's military rulers.
Despite the Administration's expressions of frustration, an adviser to Father Aristide said the meeting today was cordial and described it as more of a "strategy session."
 
Military Talks, Too
 The United States, France, Canada and Venezuela, the countries most involved in the dispute, also plan to send a delegation to meet with Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the Haitian military leader, to urge him to accept the Governors Island accords.
The effort to return Father Aristide to power is basically limited to an international oil embargo, which is bringing further havoc to the economy of Haiti, already the poorest country in the hemisphere.
"The message to Aristide is that the military is primarily responsible for the impasse and that we are applying economic pressure," said one Administration official. "But we are not content to do that and sit around and wait. We want also to have an active diplomatic process going."
 
Beyond Sanctions
 Father Aristide was told that "we are resolute about maintaining the sanctions," one of the participants in the meeting said. "But the sanctions are only a means to an end, and the cost in the country is enormous. Therefore there has to be some sort of a political vehicle to address those issues still to be resolved."
Over the weekend Mr. Malval bluntly criticized Father Aristide, saying the President has "a serious ego problem." Referring to General Cedras and to Father Aristide, a plainly irritated Mr. Malval said, "The country is stuck between a man who has refused to resign and a man who has made a choice to remain abroad as a sort of flag-bearer, a mythic symbol."
Mr. Malval resigned last week but has agreed to stay on as a caretaker.
Some of the diplomats involved said they lamented the loss of Mr. Malval, whom they saw as a pragmatic force, contrasting him with other advisers to Father Aristide who, they said, have been giving the President bad advice.
 
A Question of Security
 Advisers to Father Aristide have said that he withdrew his support for Mr. Malval's plan, which entails a conference of a broad cross-section of Haitian society, because of concern about security.
This explanation did not sit well with Administration officials. "Malval has security concerns too," said one Administration official. "He's sitting in Haiti, making efforts to get Aristide back. That involves a certain amount of risk."
The diplomats who met Father Aristide told him that if he is unwilling to back Mr. Malval's initiative, then he must support an alternative being drawn up by the four countries and the United Nations, which one described as "some sort of conference or conclave or some sort of a opportunity for the Haitian parties to work out implementation of Governors Island."

HEADLINE: Health Costs Vary Greatly By Industry, a Survey Finds

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
Employers and employees in private industry and state and local governments spent $258.5 billion for workers' health insurance last year, the Labor Department reported today in the first Federal survey of such spending.
Employers accounted for 86 percent of the total. They spent $221.4 billion for employee health benefits, or nearly six times as much as the $37.1 billion spent by workers. 
 The new study found that health care spending varied widely among industries. Manufacturers, on the average, spent much more for each worker than service industries. But the cost of health coverage was higher for transportation and public utilities than for any other industry; it averaged $3,924 for each worker. Retailers had the lowest average spending: $1,044 for each employee.
And in general, the cost of health coverage in state and local government was much higher than in private industry. The cost averaged $3,494 for each government worker, as against $2,267 for each employee in private industry.
"In state and local government, there are more professionals and other people in high-paid occupations who expect health insurance as a benefit," said Wayne M. Shelly, a Labor Department economist who worked on the survey. "Public employers have to offer such benefits to attract these workers. In addition, public employers may provide health insurance to part-time workers, whereas many private employers do not."
The survey is based on data from 5,600 work sites chosen to be representative of the nation as a whole. The data were collected in June by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a Labor Department agency, at the request of the Federal Health Care Financing Administration. The data were not available to the White House when President Clinton was drawing up his proposal to overhaul the nation's health care system.
One of the most hotly debated features of Mr. Clinton's plan would require employers to buy health insurance for their employees.
 
Complaints From Retailers
 Industries like manufacturing and transportation, which already cover a high proportion of their employees' health costs, would presumably come out winners under Mr. Clinton's plan. They would generally not have to pay more, and some might pay less, than they now pay for employees' health benefits.
Retailers, by contrast, complain that the Clinton plan would require them to pay much more than they now pay, and the new data tend to support their contention.
Benefits of all types account for 29 percent of total employee compensation, with wages and salaries accounting for 71 percent, the Labor Department reported. Health insurance accounts for nearly one-fourth of benefit costs.
 
Benefits Outpace Wages
 But the cost of benefits, led by the cost of health insurance, has been rising much faster than wages. For every $1 increase in wages and salaries over the last five years, benefits increased $1.67, the department said.
Colleen M. O'Neill, a spokeswoman for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said money that would otherwise be available for wages was needed just to maintain the health benefits that workers already have.
In 1992, spending on health care of all kinds totaled $839 billion, or 14 percent of gross domestic product, the Commerce Department has estimated. Because the Labor Department study focused on insurance provided by employers, its numbers do not reflect the costs of government programs like Medicare and Medicaid, for the elderly and the poor, or the costs of charity care.
The Administration estimates that health insurance for a two-parent family with children would cost $4,360 a year under Mr. Clinton's plan. The premium, it says, would be $3,893 for a one-parent family and $1,932 for a single person. Consumers would normally pay one-fifth of the premiums, and employers would pay the rest.
The Labor Department found that employers paid 89 percent of the cost of employee health coverage in goods-producing industries like construction and manufacturing. In service industries, the employers' share ranged from 93 percent in transportation and public utilities to 77 percent in retail stores.
Spending for employee health coverage last year totaled $67 billion in the Northeast, $72.5 billion in the South, $63.6 billion in the Middle West and $55.4 billion in the West.
The employee spending figures show only the share of premiums paid by workers for the benefits they got through their jobs. The figures do not include amounts paid for deductibles or for private insurance bought by employees on their own, outside the workplace.

HEADLINE: Haitians Bitterly Accusing Outside World of Desertion

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Dec. 20

 BODY:
In the crowded alleyways of a public market here, revived from weeks of inactivity by holiday shopping, Jean-Pierre Paul, a vendor of handmade toys and decorations, had a question for a foreigner that many Haitians are asking these days.
"What are you doing to our country?" the thin 26-year-old inquired with a mixture of anger and frustration. "Either do what is needed to bring our President back, or have the honesty to say that you have failed, and leave us alone." 
 With the approach of the third Christmas since the military coup that ousted the country's first democratically elected President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, Mr. Paul and many other Haitians are expressing increasing bitterness at what they describe as 26 months of dashed hopes, wasted lives and abandonment by the outside world.
Although an international embargo on oil and arms supplies has made life increasingly difficult for the common people, crippling transportation and slowing commerce, few Haitians, from the majority of the population that supported the election of Father Aristide to the mostly wealthy minority that loathes him, express any faith in the world's effort to restore him to the presidency.
 
Wealthy Are Little Affected
 "A sack of rice costs $25 now," said Sauveur Joseph, another market vendor, who joined in the conversation. "If you are lucky enough to have a job, you are still only making $3 a day."
What makes the pain of sanctions even harder for many Haitians to swallow is the widespread perception that their intended target -- the country's wealthy classes and particularly the military -- seems scarcely to have been affected.
Diplomats and Haitians familiar with the workings of the economy here say a porous border with the Dominican Republic and the involvement of some of the Haitian Army's leading officers in the black market for fuel have assured that enough gasoline has remained available for many in the elite to maintain a comfortable life.
Some diplomats here have predicted that the economy will crash as early as next month, forcing the army into new concessions. But many wealthy Haitians place no more stock in international efforts to restore the President to power than do the poor.
"Everyone I know will tell you the date they predict for the lifting of the embargo," said an affluent woman, who like others of her class was confident that neither Washington nor the United Nations would feel comfortable in extending the economic pain here much longer.
With the public squabbling between Father Aristide and his handpicked Prime Minister, Robert Malval, many wealthy Haitians said they were convinced that enforcement of the sanctions would fade within weeks.
 
A History of Failure
 Even diplomats concede there is as much history as cynicism behind such beliefs. Shortly after Father Aristide was overthrown, a general embargo that had shown signs of bringing the military to its knees was suddenly punctured by the unimpeded arrival of a European oil tanker. Since that time there have been many other half measures and false starts to diplomatic initiatives that have strengthened the defiance of the military and its backers and left many other Haitians deeply skeptical of the outside world.
For others, though, nothing the outside world might decide to do, short of an unlikely military intervention, would matter now.
"You are trying to coerce a bunch of people who have no sense of nation and no sense of patriotism," said a well-to-do Haitian who quietly supports Father Aristide, making her a rare exception in her class. "They don't care what happens to the ordinary Haitian. They don't even care what happens to Haiti. If things get too rough for them here, in fact, they'll just hop on the plane and join the family and fortune in the United States."

An Israeli's Vision, of Both Recent Past and Future

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG

 BODY:

The New Middle East
By Shimon Peres with Arye Naor
Illustrated. 224 pages. Henry Holt & Company. $25.
In less than half a century, Israel has produced many remarkable leaders who have been soldiers, diplomats and orators, sometimes all at once. Among those present at the creation were Yitzhak Rabin, now Prime Minister, and Shimon Peres, now Foreign Minister. Both played major roles in the handshake last September between Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization on the South Lawn of the White House. 
 Now we learn from "The New Middle East," an edifying and important book by Mr. Peres, that the handshake was the culmination of years of behind-the-scenes diplomacy and daring thinking by both sides about the future of the entire region. Looking beyond his own country's borders, Mr. Peres says he thinks the Middle East nations can be joined in a harmonious entity resembling the European Community, and he sells this bold notion convincingly.
The invisible diplomacy that preceded the accord in September makes the most tantalizing section, particularly the secret negotiations between the P.L.O. and Israel out of sight of the press in Norway. If ever an argument is needed for quiet diplomacy instead of grandstanding for the television cameras, what took place in Norway would be one.
About the talks in Oslo, Mr. Peres writes:
"The setting was ideal. In Norway, no one was looking for scoops. Even on my last trip to Oslo, not one newspaper reporter requested to accompany me. Deja vu was the general opinion among the government-run communications authorities in Israel. Why send a team to cover the visit? What could happen there? Yet because the Oslo negotiations, unlike those in Washington, were far from the eyes and ears of the media, we were able to keep the talks going for months. The two sides could talk directly, person to person, rather than simply spout rhetoric."
Mr. Peres is much too discreet about what occurred in Oslo. It would be interesting to know more about the selfless Norwegians who were the catalysts for the negotiations. And Yair Hirschfeld and Ron Pundik, the two obscure Israeli historians who broke the ice and began the secret talks in Oslo, were not invited by Mr. Peres to the Washington ceremony, as Amos Elon, Israel's keen journalist, reports in The New Yorker of Dec. 20. Mr. Peres doesn't even mention them in his book. Ever the diplomat, he credits two Egyptians, President Hosni Mubarak and Foreign Minister Amr Moussa, with saving the talks and bringing the P.L.O. and the Israelis back together whenever they reached a dead end.
"The New Middle East" is a textbook lesson in how a small nation negotiates in the changed world after the cold war, when even large nations have given up some of their sovereignty. Mr. Peres says that during the negotiations, he touched base with most of the European countries; he was aware that their tacit approval of an agreement and their economic help would be needed. The United States, once the exemplar of shuttle diplomacy in the Middle East, stood more in the wings than at center stage during the negotiations.
At the heart of Mr. Peres's proposals for the next step in the Middle East is economic cooperation: first commerce with open borders, then political understanding. He says that no nation in the Middle East can prosper on its own and that the way to defeat the militant Muslim fundamentalists who oppose the agreement is to attack the roots of poverty and despair. How to do so?
"Some of the basic rules for establishing a modern economy are clear," Mr. Peres writes. "Decrease the war chest; increase investment in education; use available natural reserves wisely and create alternatives as necessary; establish required energy and desalination plants; construct a state-of-the-art infrastructure for communications and transportation; develop industry, agriculture and tourism, making use of all existing advantages; open borders and encourage competition."
Mr. Peres tells why it made historical as well as political sense for Israel to agree to the principle of rule by the Palestinian majority in Gaza. He notes that the city of Gaza is 7,000 troubled years old. What good is control, he wonders, if Israel cannot improve conditions for the people? He answers himself: "Samson, in his time, took a drastic step, bringing down the columns of the shrine in Gaza. There was no point in our repeating it."
In his occasionally repetitious but frequently eloquent book, Mr. Peres often invokes the Bible to drive home his theme of economic unity. Referring to the scarcity of water in the Middle East, Mr. Peres says that Jacob and Esau drank from the same wells, even when their paths separated. But he adds that they were unable to desalinate sea water, computerize irrigation or enjoy the fruits of biotechnology.
Writing of the potential for tourism throughout the Middle East, Mr. Peres says that Jews, Christians and Arabs share an ancestor, Abraham, who was known for his hospitality. "Throughout history," he writes, "Abraham's descendants have recognized the importance of hospitality and have tried to emulate their ancestor." Building on this pleasant thought, he envisions tourism as a great growth industry all over the Middle East.
Word-slinging and stone-throwing may continue, yet Mr. Peres leaves a strong impression in "The New Middle East" that a diplomat may find an advantage in coming from a land of prophets and miracles.

HEADLINE: Gain Seen in High-Temperature Superconductors

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
A TEAM of French scientists has reported that it created a small sample of material that acts like a superconductor of electricity at a temperature of minus 10 degrees Fahrenheit, far warmer than that of previously known superconductors.
The complex material, assembled atom by atom, was capable of transmitting only a minuscule amount of electrical current, much too little to have any practical use. But the scientists involved, Dr. Michel Lagues and his colleagues at the Higher School of Physics and Industrial Chemistry of the City of Paris and the University of Paris, say they believe they have taken an important step toward developing the technology of superconductors. 
 Superconductivity is the ability of a material to transmit a current of electricity with little or no resistance. It was discovered in 1911, but the researchers led by Dr. Lagues say in the current issue of the journal Science that they believe the material they invented is the highest-temperature superconductor yet created.
The French material is a many-layered sandwich in which each repeating sequence has one layer of mixed bismuth, strontium, calcium and oxygen, followed by up to eight consecutive layers of copper oxide, each one only a single atom thick. The all-important copper oxide layers are applied by "sequentially imposed layer epitaxy," in which copper is vaporized in the presence of oxygen and shot at the top of the sandwich, an atom at a time, by an electron gun. Like the electron beam that scans the inside of a video tube to produce a picture, the beam of copper scans back and forth a line at a time.
The cautiously worded French paper does not assert that superconductivity was achieved at high temperature, but merely that measurements were "consistent" with the phenomenon. The French claim has yet to be verified experimentally by others.
Dr. Richard L. Greene, director of the Center for Superconductivity Research at the University of Maryland at College Park, was one of the scientists who assessed the French paper for publication in Science. In an interview, he said that the paper should be treated with some skepticism, and that only a portion of the new substance may be superconductive.
 
Guarded Optimism
 "No one is likely to believe their results until they've been tested by other groups," he said. "There are a lot of funny things about that paper. But lots of things we don't know about are possible, and we need to keep an open mind."
Low-temperature superconductors, which operate at minus 452 degrees (the temperature of liquid helium), have been in use for decades. But in 1987, materials scientists at the University of Houston discovered that a ceramic compound in which yttrium and barium are blended with copper oxide becomes a superconductor at minus 387 degrees. The discovery prompted a wave of excitement among physicists and officials of the Reagan Administration. There were heady predictions that high-temperature superconductors would lead to efficient electric generators, superconducting power lines, magnetically levitated trains requiring very little energy and other marvels.
Laboratories around the world have steadily developed new compounds that superconduct electricity at increasingly higher temperatures, but practical applications have been few and economically modest.

HEADLINE: Bugs Keep Planet Livable Yet Get No Respect

BYLINE: By WILLIAM K. STEVENS

 BODY:
HUMANS may think they are evolution's finest product, but the creepies, crawlies and squishies rule the world. Remove people from the face of the earth and the biosphere would perk along just fine, ecologists say. Remove the invertebrates -- creatures like insects, spiders, worms, snails and protozoans -- and the global ecosystem would collapse, humans and other vertebrates would probably last only a few months, and the planet would belong mostly to algae and fungi.
But does invertebrates' indispensable role in supporting human life earn them any understanding, gratitude, respect or even recognition? Precious little, according to a new study that explores both the critical importance of invertebrates and people's attitudes toward them. The study suggests that for the most part people hate the myriad small, spineless creatures on which their very existence depends and would just as soon see them wiped out. 
 People have long been repelled by bugs, worms and the like, of course, but hostility to invertebrates has now become a dangerous attitude, says the author of the study, Dr. Stephen R. Kellert, a professor of social ecology at Yale University, whose findings are reported in the December issue of the journal Conservation Biology.
 
Catastrophic Losses
 Because many people do not know or care much about invertebrates, Dr. Kellert said, they do not worry about conserving them. Yet to the extent that humans are precipitating a mass extinction of species, as many biologists believe, invertebrates are being hit the hardest. The world is experiencing a "catastrophic loss" of invertebrate life as natural areas are destroyed and degraded, he writes. Despite this loss, he continues, "the general public seems largely unaware of its possible impact on human well-being."
Not least because invertebrates are so pervasive, conservationists have lately shifted their focus to the protection of entire ecosystems, with all their multifarious tiny life forms. Rescuing single species of big animals like tigers, whales, pandas, bears, wolves, eagles and condors is not enough, according to the new philosophy; for all their charisma, they are far less important to the maintenance of life than the uncountable armies of the spineless, not to mention vascular plants and bacteria.
"The world is going to go on without golden lemurs and without any one of a number of orchids," but invertebrates "are responsible for all the ecosystem processes," said Melody Allen, the director of the Xerces Society, the country's only conservation organization devoted to invertebrates. The society, based in Portland, Ore., is named after an extinct butterfly.
 
90 to 95 Percent of Animal Species
 Invertebrates -- the group includes mostly insects and spiders but also other soft-bodied and sometimes hard-shelled organisms like crabs, lobsters, clams, squid, sea urchins, jellyfish and sponges -- account for 90 to 95 percent of animal species and total animal weight on earth. In reviewing the scientific literature on the subject, Dr. Kellert found that in the United States, for instance, the combined biomass, or dry weight, of earthworms, insects and spiders is 55 times greater than that of humans.
Partly because of their sheer numbers, invertebrates are the biological foundations of every ecosystem. They are not merely indispensable links in the food chain or key denizens of wild habitats, though they are both of those; to a large extent they are the habitat. They maintain the soil structure and fertility on which plant growth and thus all higher organisms depend. They cycle nutrients by consuming decaying matter, pollinate crops and other plants, disperse seeds, keep populations of potentially harmful organisms under control and eliminate wastes. In the ultimate example, colonies of corals, many of them now endangered, provide habitats for a seemingly infinite variety of sea creatures, including perhaps one-third of all fish species.
While scientists know in general that invertebrates are the key to ecosystem functioning, they know comparatively little about the details and, in fact, scientists say that many of the tiny actors are completely unknown. Consequently, said Ms. Allen, "we can't even recoup our losses" if particular assemblages of invertebrates disappear and their ecosystems consequently fall apart.
On another level, the spineless kingdom directly provides food for innumerable larger organisms, including humans. People may dislike the look of crabs, as Dr. Kellert reports, but they eat them with gusto, along with lobsters, clams, crayfish, oysters, scallops, octopuses and squids. Many non-Western peoples dote on locusts, ants, termites, grasshoppers and beetle grubs.
One example offered by Dr. Kellert speaks volumes about humans' dependence on invertebrates. In the United States, humans produce some 130 million tons of excreta annually, while livestock produces an additional 12 billion tons. "Of this waste," Dr. Kellert writes, "99 percent is thought to be decomposed by invertebrates, leaving one to wonder, if not for our 'little friends,' what humans would be 'up to their eyeballs in.' "
If invertebrates are so valuable, then, why do people so often regard them with anxiety and disgust? That they do so was borne out by a limited survey of attitudes conducted by Dr. Kellert among various economic and social groups in and around New Haven. The survey included 145 members of the general public as well as separate, randomly selected samples of farmers, scientists and members of conservation groups.
"For the most part," said Dr. Kellert, "we found that aversion, anxiety, disdain, fear and loathing were very prevalent," especially regarding insects and spiders. A large majority of the general public, according to the sampling, displayed dislike of ants, bugs, beetles, ticks, cockroaches and crabs. A majority expressed willingness to eliminate whole classes of animals altogether, including mosquitoes, cockroaches, fleas, moths and spiders. Farmers conveyed similar attitudes, and both groups disapproved of major expenditures or economic sacrifices on behalf of endangered invertebrates.
Scientists, and to a lesser extent conservation group members, were far more likely to support such efforts. The best-educated people expressed the greatest conservation concern for invertebrates, as did younger people and men. Biological scientists, as might be expected, knew more about invertebrates and were more interested in and less afraid of them than other scientists. A series of true-false questions indicated that most people had a limited knowledge of invertebrates.
 
Reasons for Human Aversion
 Dr. Kellert's search of the scientific literature turned up a number of possible reasons for humans' aversion, which he offers as speculative explanations. Some are obvious: the ability of some insects to harm people (through stinging and disease transmission) and crops, for instance. Some scientists have suggested that humans have a genetic predisposition toward this fear, forged out of evolutionary necessity millenniums ago, and that it has been generalized to include other invertebrates.
Other speculation holds that the appearance of many invertebrates, their otherworldly monstrosity, plays a role. Some scientists also suggest that their overwhelming numbers and rapid reproduction rates challenge human assumptions about personal identity and individuality, that they are perceived as pitiless and devoid of feelings, and that their willingness and ability to invade human space so ingeniously, insidiously and indifferently to human wishes threatens humans' feelings of control and security. Ignorance undoubtedly plays a big role: "For most people," Dr. Kellert writes, "invertebrates remain largely alien and unfathomable."
Some species are exceptions to the general rule of fear and loathing, of course. The Kellert survey found more positive attitudes toward pretty invertebrates like butterflies, and toward useful ones like shrimp and bees and those with recreational value, like mollusks whose shells are collected at the shore.
In this, Dr. Kellert sees cause for hope among conservationists. Some charismatic butterflies and utilitarian creatures like bees might be enlisted as conservation symbols, just as whales and elephants have been, he says. Likewise, he says, corals might provide an especially effective symbol because "we do have an emotional tendency to recognize order and pattern and harmony, if you will, in nature," and nothing in the world better suggests this than a coral reef. The association of greater education with increased knowledge and concern about biological diversity in general and invertebrates in particular is also encouraging, he wrote.
While it is unlikely that many people will learn to love bugs and slugs, Dr. Kellert wrote, it may be that a greater appreciation of their importance to the ecology and ultimately to human welfare can do much to change human attitudes. Ms. Allen of the Xerces Society says that in her experience, people tend to "get over some of their phobic responses" once they understand invertebrates better. Even so, she said, "the most difficult thing in the conservation world is to get even other conservationists to realize the role of invertebrates."

Diagrams: "The Importance of Being Spineless"
 Invertebrates, animals that lack backbones, are so pervasive that it may be said life depends on them. The most numerous are insects, but there are also spiders, lobsters, corals, worms, etc.
 Some insects prey on invertebrates humans dislike.
 Many insects feed on other invertebrates, sometimes specializing in one species, and many of the prey species are crop pests.
 
"The little guys who run the world"
 Invertebrates build soil into the fertile matrix for plant life, and therefore support life for all mammals, including humans. Some insects act as the matchmakers for much of plant sex life, as many plants rely on insects for pollination. They also do important work in seed dispersal.
 
Invertebrates help explain all of nature.
 Syntomid moth's mimicry of wasp sheds light on adaptation. Study of fruit fly Drosophila has provided major revelations in genetics.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
To Russia in Constancy

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Sometime soon after the anti-Communist revolution, a new mantra entered international life.
The phrases "free-market economy" and "democracy" became chanted together, an inseparable formula. Without one, the other could not exist. In combination they were sung as the only answer to the future of Eastern Europe and Russia. 
 The mantra met the beliefs of many economists and politicians in the West and the dreams of reformers in the new Russia.
I understood the belief and dreams. I had reported from Poland in the cold days of Communism. The system disgusted me. Only a fool, ideologue or apparatchik would not understand that it was totally corrupt, totally brutal, totally inefficient.
And no democracy, however imperfect, came near Communism for distribution of poverty, or stultification. Whenever I left Poland to visit a free city, the mere sight of a stall with fruit or a kiosk with choice made my mouth water and brain tingle.
But democracy within a fully free market is not reachable in Russia any near tomorrow. Three problems will logically slow its arrival. If the West and Russian reformers do not face them, the result may be neither a free market nor a democracy but one more all-controlling despotism -- fascist or Communist.
First: The formula does not always work. Dictatorships by the sewerful have used some form of market economy to strengthen themselves; the Nazis in Germany, the Communists in China, Saddam Hussein in Iraq, the ayatollahs in Iran.
And time and again democracies like India have crept ahead while neighbors like China leapt forward. No mystery: dictatorships can act without the consent of the people. That is a laborious, quarrelsome business. Its only value is that it means the difference between breathing freedom and breathing slavery.
The second problem is that Russians, with no experience in democratic economics, are asked to create a fully free market, quick, snap, while established democracies still move toward it with enormous caution. In Japan, business, government and politicians work together in a largely closed system. In Western Europe, public telephones and telecommunications still are in government hands. In the U.S., administrations are elected and survive by ladling out advantage to selected parts of the society.
Since free markets usually mean unemployment for some to create prosperity for more, Westerners protect themselves with nets of unemployment insurance and social security as they inch toward the risks. For Russians -- no inching, no nets, just the plunge.
The third problem could be the most dangerous. Too many Russian workers feel that the new economic system is being shoved down their throats. Economic hard times become a personal and national humiliation -- a combination that helped Russian fascism get a quarter of the party votes, and a variety of Communists take another large chunk.
Russians created Russia and Russians will have to solve its problems. But the West can help. One way is to draw closer to Russian reformers and other democrats -- not just President Yeltsin but all the others who will have to think things through.
Full speed toward the free market would be fine -- if it could be maintained at acceptable social price. But so far it has meant murderous inflation and more unemployment, without the increased production it is supposed to bring.
For the sake of the civil peace that democracy needs to grow, President Yeltsin may have to listen to reformers who argue for a slower pace -- keeping some subsidies, some controls and some tariffs to buoy drowning industries. Name a Western nation that is not doing that right now.
If the pace has to slow, the West should not denounce or isolate Russia in the name of economic theory. If Russian workers want a little more job security to butter their freedom, and shout that economic theory alone can be too dry to swallow, are they different from Western workers?
We are asking the democrats of Russia to hang together against fascism and Communism. So it would be cruel and self-defeating for the West to choose this moment of crisis to withhold our constancy from those democrats. The revolution against Communism was fought for freedom, not an economics textbook.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Good Year Is Seen for Municipals

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The main reason that the municipal bond market looks so attractive next year is that the flood of new issues that marked 1993 is expected to slow substantially in 1994.
This decline should relieve the downward pressure on prices that analysts contend is the reason the municipal bond market has underperformed the Treasury market this year. 
With next year's new supply expected to fall to the pace of 1991, the increase in Federal tax rates should be able to make tax-exempt municipal bonds attractive enough to give prices a good boost. Under the new top tax rate of 39.6 percent, a municipal bond yield of 5.70 percent has a tax-equivalent yield of 9.44 percent, up from 8.26 percent before this year's tax increase.
According to a forecast by the Public Securities Association, new issues should drop to $178.6 billion next year -- a decline of more than a third -- as stable or even rising interest rates end the rush to pay off older, higher- interest-rate debt.
 
Two Banner Years
 The sharp falloff in new issues will follow two consecutive record-setting years. In 1993, the association projects that new issues will reach $289.5 billion, which would be a 23.4 percent jump from the 1992 record of $234.6 billion. In 1991, new issues totaled $174.1 billion.
The association forecast includes both a decline in new issues used to pay off older high-interest debt and in new issues to raise money for projects. New issues for paying off old debt, which are forecast to rise 57.1 percent, to $192.9 billion this year, are predicted to fall to $68.9 billion in 1994, a decline of 64.3 percent.
The level of issues raising money for new projects is predicted to slip 13.6 percent next year to $96.6 billion, down from an estimated $111.8 billion this year. Most of the decline will be in new issues for projects like roads, bridges and single-family housing.
 
Treasury Market
 There was little going on in the bond market yesterday, with the trading pace beginning to drop off ahead of the holiday weekend. But the subtle nudging of the Federal Reserve continued as Administration officials said they saw no need to raise interest rates now.
The comments came ahead of today's meeting of the Fed policy-making committee to set its interest-rate goals going into next year. Analysts do not expect the Federal Reserve to make any change in policy now, which means its short-term interest-rate target will remain at 3 percent. But many analysts expect that the Fed will have to raise its interest-rate target sometime in the first half of next year to head off a rise in inflation.
In comments at the White House, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen said that both the Fed and the Administration wanted sustained growth with low inflation. "That's the objective, I think, of not just this Administration, but, I think it's the objective of the Fed in addition," Mr. Bentsen told reporters.
A rumor early in the day that the Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, was thinking of resigning, did not seem to have an impact on the market, as it was quickly squashed.
In late trading in the secondary market, the price of the 30-year bond due in August 2023 was down 11/32as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, rose to 6.30 percent, from 6.27 percent on Friday. Short-term interest rates jumped a little further. The price of the two-year note was down 3/32 as the yield rose to 4.20 percent from 4.15 percent.
 
Results of Auction
 In the weekly auction of Treasury bills, the average discount rate on the three-month bill was 3.06 percent, the same as a week ago, while the average rate on the six-month bill was 3.25 percent, down from 3.26 percent last week.
There are little major economic data scheduled for release this week but traders and investors will have to get by the Treasury auction of two-year notes today and five-year notes Wednesday. After that the week is basically over, with a half-day session scheduled for Thursday and the Treasury market closed on Friday.
In trading in the pre-auction market, the yield on the two-year note was at 4.25 percent, up from 4.21 percent, while the yield on the five-year note was 5.21 percent, up from 5.16 percent.
Following are the results from the Treasury auction yesterday of three-month and six-month bills:

CORRECTION-DATE: January 1, 1994, Saturday

 CORRECTION:
An article in Business Day on Dec. 21 about the credit markets misstated the periods involved in the Public Securities Association's forecast for the issuing of municipal bonds for new projects. The association forecast of a decline of 13.6 percent, to $96.6 billion, was for 1993, not 1994. The association's estimate of $111.8 billion was for 1992, not 1993. For 1994, the association forecasts an increase of 13.6 percent, to $109.7 billion, in these new issues.

HEADLINE: NEW YORK COUNCIL VOTES TAX BREAKS FOR HUGE TOWERS

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
The New York City Council, in a tumultuous meeting that ended its legislative session, voted overwhelmingly yesterday to extend tax breaks to developers who build large apartment towers in Manhattan.
The bill, which is intended to give a stimulus to the city's anemic construction industry, extends to midtown and lower Manhattan a property-tax abatement that has been available to developers since 1975 in most of the city. For developers who qualify for the break, taxes are frozen for 10 years at the amount the owner of the site paid before the new construction. 
 The tax abatement bill was passed on a day of jampacked agendas, fiery oratory, partisan votes and bittersweet farewells. Mayor David N. Dinkins gave a last address to the Council, telling its members that they were the sole guardians of the liberal tradition of the city, now that a Republican had been elected Mayor.
 
Impassioned Debate
 Mr. Dinkins urged the Council to preserve the programs he had started, including the expansion of the Police Department, new health clinics in poor neighborhoods, the all-civilian police review board and the awarding of more city contracts to companies owned by women and minorities.
Besides the tax abatement, the Council, after long and impassioned debate, approved two well-publicized bills Mr. Dinkins has promised to veto: one to regulate vans that provide taxi service and the other relaxing regulations on horse-drawn carriages. Mr. Dinkins's veto of the horse-carriage bill would mean that after Jan. 1 the 19th-century-style carriages now confined mostly to Central Park would be able to range throughout the city, at least until new legislation is adopted. [Page B3.]
Proponents of the tax-incentive bill argued that development had all but come to a standstill in Manhattan, hitting its lowest points since the fiscal crisis of the mid-1970's. They said developers needed help to counter the prolonged economic slump. Mayor Dinkins had requested the bill, which was passed, 39 to 8, after little debate.
 
Hope for Recovery
 "I don't see the construction industry falling all over itself to start new jobs in the city of New York," said Herbert E. Berman, a Brooklyn Democrat, a backer of the bill. "The reality is the construction industry is totally flat and dead and these abatements are the engines that fuel economic recovery."
But a handful of opponents charged that the incentives amounted to an unnecessary giveaway to individual developers, among them William Zeckendorf, who is planning a residential project at 56th Street and Broadway that would become eligible under the new law. "It's done for Zeckendorf, and we don't know for who else," Ronnie M. Eldridge, a Manhattan Democrat, said.
Ruth W. Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, urged the Council to reject the bill, saying it was spurring development in Manhattan, especially along Broadway in the 50's and below Chambers Street, rather than in other boroughs, where new housing is sorely needed.
"This is encouraging residential development in the wrong place at the wrong time," Ms. Messinger said.
During a real-estate boom in 1985, the city cut midtown and the area south of Chambers Street out of the abatement program, saying incentives were no longer needed. The law passed yesterday reinstates the abatement for the next three years to those zones, which allow towers with 15 times the floor space of the plot.
To qualify, the developer must promise to reserve one in five apartments for low-income families and must build on a vacant or underused property. The city collects no new property taxes for 10 years beyond what the developer paid before the new building went up. Then the new value of the property is gradually added to the old assessment over 10 years, after which the developer begins to shoulder the full tax burden.
It is impossible to say how much tax revenue the city will forgo because no one knows for certain how many buildings would have been built in midtown and lower Manhattan without the incentives, city officials said. But the abatements do have an impact. In 1992, for instance, the city sacrificed $189 million in taxes from hundreds of buildings constructed under the program since 1975.
These were among the other important bills that were approved:
*A measure to let the Department of Buildings contract with a nonprofit organization to do plumbing inspections. Municipal unions opposed the bill, saying it cost more money than paying the plumbing inspectors a higher wage as a way to reduce corruption. But proponents argued that recent arrests of dozens of plumbing inspectors on corruption charges made a radical reform necessary.
*A pilot program aimed at reducing accidents involving speeding tow trucks. It would give certain towing companies a monopoly on business in some neighborhoods to prevent freelance tow trucks from monitoring police radios and rushing to accidents.
*A law to restrict use of car alarms, making it possible for the police or ticket agents to write a ticket when a alarm goes off for more than three minutes. The current law allows them to sound for 10 minutes.
*A measure that allows the city to close a business for illegal activities, including prostitution, drug dealing or gambling, after three violations, rather than the current five.
Dinkins administration officials vehemently denied that the tax-abatement bill was intended to help Mr. Zeckendorf, or any particular developer. They said the measure was an effort to infuse new life in a moribund construction industry that produced fewer apartments this year than at any time since World War II.
"Zeckendorf may have a project, he may not," said Harold Schultz, deputy commissioner of the Department of Housing Preservation and Development. "No one has approached us with an application at this point."
The Council Speaker, Peter F. Vallone characterized the measure as "a signal to the people out there that we would like to see some activity."
Some Council members voted for the abatement with reservations, saying the entire method New York uses to dole out abatements needs revamping. Kenneth K. Fisher, a Democrat from Brooklyn, said he believes the city should rethink the philosophy of giving tax incentives automatically to developers. But in the meantime he supported the measure in the hope that it would create jobs. "I'd rather have half of something than all of nothing," he said.
Charles Millard, a Manhattan Republican, said: "The real issue is whether we let the market operate. Developers, just like everyone else, need to be subject to the market."
Warren Wechsler, vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York, said that for most developers, exclusion of some parts of Manhattan from the abatement never made sense since residential buildings should be encouraged everywhere. He said the measure was needed because only 2,728 units had been built this year, the fewest in decades.
"Based on the figures I have seen," he said, "the last year was one of the lowest for production of privately financed housing since the middle of World War II and the early 1930's."
In other business, the Council approved six nominees from Mr. Dinkins for several city boards -- three to the Environmental Control Board and one each to the Board of Standards and Appeals, Board of Health and Civil Service Commission.

HEADLINE: MORE OF HOMELESS ARE NOW FAMILIES

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21

 BODY:
A survey of 26 major cities has found that the proportion of the homeless population consisting of families with children increased by 30 percent this year.
While families made up 33 percent of those seeking food and shelter last year, they account for 43 percent now, according to a report on the status of Hunger and Homelessness in American Cities. The report was released today by the United States Conference of Mayors. 
 Andrew Cuomo, director of policies on homelessness for the Department of Housing and Urban Development, said at a news conference announcing the report that homeless families with children had nothing to do with the more visible homeless adults with mental, drug or alcohol problems.
Mr. Cuomo said that the number of homeless families was growing but that the public was not aware of it because, unlike the mentally ill, the families were "not on the streets, not on park benches, not in doorways."
According to the report, the number of people requesting emergency food assistance increased by 13 percent this year. It said that while resources available for providing food had increased by an average of 7 percent, two out of three cities reported they could not provide adequate food for those requesting it.
 
Unemployment Cited As Factor
 In New York City, for example, where families make up 75 percent of homeless people, 38,000 people a month were turned away from emergency food providers because of a lack of food. At the same time, the report noted that requests for shelter in New York and four other cities had declined slightly.
Freeman Bosley Jr., Mayor of St. Louis and a co-chairman of the Conference of Mayors, said much of the increase in homelessness and hunger could be attributed to underemployment. Thirty percent of adults requesting food assistance this year were employed, he said, adding, "There is a significant number of working poor among the homeless."
The report revealed that the proportion of homeless people who are in families with children varied around the country. Trenton had the highest proportion of families, at 77 per cent. In Nashville and New Orleans, on the other hand, families accounted for only 16 percent and 14 percent of the homeless population respectively.
 
Economic Recovery Could Help
 Portland, Ore., showed the biggest increase in requests for food and shelter -- 88 percent -- followed by Los Angeles with a 50 percent increase.
Mr. Cuomo and other experts on homelessness see the number of families on the street as an economic problem. In the report, New York City officials said they believed the slow recovery from a prolonged recession would make it unlikely that the demand for food and shelter would increase, especially among families.
Recently, Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros made homelessness his top priority, requesting a doubling of the budget for dealing with the problem from $800 million to $1.6 billion, signaling a change in priorities.
"It has been very lonely for us on this issue," Tom Cochran, the executive director of the Conference of Mayors, said at a news conference. He said that for the first time since the task force was set up 10 years ago, an Administration official was present at the news conference.
Advocates have declared today, the first day of winter, Homeless Persons Memorial Day. Across the country memorial services are being held by advocacy groups to commemorate homeless people who died this year.

HEADLINE: As Free Trade Draws Nations Together, Campus Becomes 'Mexico Think Tank'

BYLINE: By ANTHONY DePALMA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEXICO CITY, Dec. 21

 BODY:
When President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico needed to better understand the emotional tugs and pulls of United States opinion on illegal immigration, he turned to the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at the University of California at San Diego.
When Pedro Aspe, the Mexican Secretary of Finance, wanted perspectives on economic development in the United States, he turned up at the center. 
 And when several hundred businessmen sought ways to enter a Mexican market about to be opened up by the passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement, they, too, came to the center for help.
As United States and Mexico draw closer economically and culturally with the free trade agreement, which takes effect on Jan. 1, the 15-year-old research center not far from the border has become a clearinghouse for information and analysis.
 
'Main Think Tank'
 "The center is the main Mexico think tank in the United States," said Victor Aviles, Press Minister at the Mexican Embassy in Washington. Mr. Aviles was a fellow at the center's summer program in United States studies for Latin American students. "It was my introduction to the United States."
The center -- the largest in the country devoted to Mexico-United States studies -- trains graduate students and runs special sessions for research fellows and visiting scholars from throughout the United States, Mexico and the rest of Latin America. Researchers there have studied Mexico's political, economic and social cultures and how they interact with the United States. It has become an important source of analysis for journalists covering the border and for elected officials trying to understand migration and other issues.
Over the last five years, the center's researchers have generally been supportive of Mr. Salinas's open-market economic changes and of how he has tamed inflation. Parts of Mexico's new agricultural subsidy program, which includes small farmers who had been excluded from previous efforts, was based in part on work done at the center.
Much of the center's research projected that a free trade agreement with the United States would be beneficial, although the work of Harley Shaiken, a labor economist attached to the center, was critical of the impact a trade agreement would have on workers.
 
Budget Is Problem
 Mr. Salinas is a friend of the center's director, Wayne A. Cornelius. Some analysts say that since the Mexican President took office in late 1988, the tone of the center's work has not been critical enough of social problems in Mexico or of the Salinas Administration's reluctance to make substantive political changes. But the center has published critical studies of parts of Mr. Salinas's policies, including his anti-poverty program, Solidarity. A center report said the Salinas Administration used Solidarity to build a new political base.
With the advent of the free-trade agreement, the need for the center's expertise has increased. But its financial support has become dangerously thin, leaving questions about its future. Although the number of requests from Government officials, journalists and businesses is up, no extra staff members have been hired.
"The total pot of funds we have to allocate to researchers is half what it used to be," Professor Cornelius said.
Thirty-four percent of the center's $1.1 million budget comes from the state university system or from the San Diego campus. The California budget crisis has forced the university to revise its priorities, making the center's financing less certain. More than ever, the center has had to rely on contributions from private foundations and other donors. The Mexican Government provides $50,000 a year.
The money crunch comes at a critical time. The free trade agreement will reduce and eventually eliminate the tariffs on most goods crossing between Mexico and the United States. It also represents a coming together of two nations that have been split by wars and mistrust.
That closeness may require understanding and a sharing of information that does not now exist. "I find it frightening that when Ross Perot claims that all Mexicans live in shacks without plumbing," Professor Cornelius said, "millions of American believe him."
When the center was founded in 1979, the only interest most people in the United States had in Mexico was in Mexican oil. After the Arab oil embargo, "Mexico was viewed as key to long-term energy security in the United States," he said. "Mexico was suddenly on everyone's radar scope."
Other centers have been established at the University of Texas at Austin, the University of Arizona in Tucson and Tulane University in New Orleans, but they do not compare with the scope of San Diego's.
"No other place has the kind of concentrated program that San Diego has," said Richard Sinkin, who was a professor of Mexican history at the University of Texas for 17 years. Mr. Sinkin is now a managing partner at Inter American Holdings, a consulting company, and was involved in organizing a business forum recently sponsored by the San Diego center.
The center enjoys an advantage over other programs because of its closeness to the border, but that location also makes some work more difficult. Professor Cornelius recently wrote an opinion article in The Los Angeles Times in which he criticized as neo-nativist the San Diego residents who complained about the costs of education and social services for Mexican immigrants.
That elicited 100 letters to the newspaper, some of which suggested that one way to start dealing with California's budget problems was to dismiss Professor Cornelius.
 
Ties to President
 Professor Cornelius, who is 48, comes to his understanding about Mexico by way of a small mining town in western Pennsylvania and a high school study-abroad program that took him to Mexico for the first time. He later became a member of the political science faculty at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where he taught for eight years before the San Diego campus invited him to establish the center.
While he was teaching at M.I.T., Professor Cornelius had a particularly bright graduate student from Harvard who took advantage of cross-registration privileges between the two institutions. His name was Carlos Salinas de Gortari.
"At that point I couldn't tell how high he could rise," Professor Cornelius said. "He clearly stood out among the foreign students who took classes at M.I.T. during that period as someone with extraordinary drive and intelligence."
The two have remained close. In 1991 the center organized a luncheon with President Salinas in which it raised $87,500 for its endowment. Professor Cornelius is a regular visitor to Los Pinos, the Mexican White House.
Some critics say that the center is too close to the Salinas Administration. A case in point, they say, came this year, when Raul Salinas, the President's brother, was appointed a guest scholar in residence. Described as an engineer and agronomist, he researched land ownership reforms undertaken during his brother's term in office.
Professor Cornelius said that Mr. Salinas came with a legitimate research project and his own financial support. "We have never turned away a qualified researcher with a serious piece of Mexico-related research as long as he had his own financial support," he said.
But he conceded the difficulty of maintaining an image of impartiality, particularly with the increased attention on Mexico. "We're always walking a tightrope," he said. "Namely, are we going to be perceived as advocates or agents of Mexico in the U.S., or as agents for some interests of the United States in Mexico."
 
Reams of Research
 The output of the center's research can be seen in 91 dissertations and more than 115 books, reports and other publications that are used in 120 colleges and universities. Graduates now hold positions in universities all over the continent, as well as in many branches of the Mexican Government.
Reaching agreement on a free trade agreement was only the beginning of a long process of integration for the two nations, Professor Cornelius said. "I view this as a period of both great potential opportunity and great potential conflict," he said. "To the extent that the costs of this trade agreement are going to be spread over the short term, and the benefits realized only over a much longer period of time, there's a potential for recrimination and tension that didn't exist before."

Economic Focus in Shanghai: Catching Up

BYLINE: By PATRICK E. TYLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SHANGHAI

 BODY:
If there is a swaggerer in this part of the world, its name is Shanghai.
This Chinese city is racing to recapture the glory of capitalism that flourished here 60 years ago and crumbled under the scorn and persecution of Communism. 
 Recently released private speeches by China's senior leader, Deng Xiaoping, make it clear for the first time that China's largest industrial city was deliberately excluded from the boom unleashed 15 years ago in a series of experiments that became a revolution.
Back in 1978, fear of failure, and the untested nature of economic reform, left the 13 million residents of Shanghai on the sidelines for more than a decade as "special economic zones" to invent a new Chinese capitalism took off along China's southern coastline.
 
What $40 Billion Buys
 Today Shanghai is racing to catch up, laying the foundations of a new financial capital with a $40 billion public-works binge and a development plan that is putting factories in the rice fields of Pudong, on the east bank of the Huang Pu River, which divides Shanghai.
The economic reformers plan to activate the latent economic power of the Yangtze River delta, bringing Shanghai into competitive play with Hong Kong, Taiwan, South Korea and Singapore.
Thus the ailing Mr. Deng, who is 89, and his reform-minded proteges hope to buttress the political bulwark they have been building against ideological and economic retrenchment after his death.
 
First, the Foundations
 To scan Shanghai's horizon is to see the scale of its transformation.
Construction cranes tower over bulldozed neighborhoods as a new merchant class builds office towers, hotels and shopping centers with money from Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan and the United States.
The largest investor, however, is the Government, which is laying roads and building bridges that will make the new city possible. The first stage is almost complete.
In October the world's longest cable-stayed bridge opened over the Huang Pu. An elevated six-lane ring road, a crosstown expressway and the first line of a subway system are all in progress. New harbor facilities are opening, and water, gas and sewage works. And the first turbines of a new power plant are to begin cranking in 1994.
On the east bank of the river, facing the Bund, old Shanghai's Art Deco waterfront of banks, trading houses and hotels, the skyline is dominated by Asia's tallest television tower, a 1,500-foot-tall architectural Goliath. The tower, which will open next year, has a center spine that pierces two giant "pearls," one of them a geodesic dome housing an elevated shopping mall.
"This tower will be the future symbol of Shanghai," said Yu Guozhuang, an official of the People's Bank of China, which organized $100 million in loans from dozens of Chinese banks for the project.
On thousands of acres around the tower, city officials say, there will be a financial district that they hope will become the Manhattan of the East within 20 years.
"I think we can do it," said Xu Kuangdi, the Executive Deputy Mayor, who spends as much time selling the new Shanghai as he does administering the old one.
 
The Politics
To Modernize, First Apologize
 The scale of Shanghai's program is reminiscent of the post-World War II rebuilding of European and Japanese cities. And the new Shanghai is politically significant because it signals the end of the ideological debate over China's free-market experiments.
"Shanghai's emergence depended upon the success of the earlier stages of reform," Geremie Barme, a China scholar at the Australian National University, said on a recent visit to Shanghai. "Only when that success was assured would they dare tamper with Shanghai."
As Mayor Huang Ju likes to say, 400 million Chinese -- 8 percent of the world's population linked in an expanding Yangtze River economy with Shanghai as "the head of the dragon" -- could be an irresistible political force after Mr. Deng is gone.
"Every act has its political component," Mr. Barme said. "Once they decided to put Shanghai on line as an economic region, it means that they need to do it."
 
'Mea Culpa' From Mr. Deng
 The publication of Mr. Deng's private speeches over the past decade marked the first time that Shanghai residents heard his candid confession of February 1992.
"One of my biggest mistakes," he told a group of Communist cadres, was to exclude Shanghai from the economic zones set up after a meeting of the Communist Party Central Committee in December 1978. That was the year of Mr. Deng's comeback after the death of Mao Zedong in 1976.
By leaving Shanghai out of the economic plan, Mr. Deng acknowledged, he consigned a huge population to another generation of poverty. Had he acted earlier, he said, "the situation in the Yangtze delta, the whole Yangtze Valley, indeed in all of China would be quite different."
That one leader's whimsy could spell rags or riches for so many reflects the enormous scale and impact of social and economic engineering under Chinese Communism.
How could anyone have known then what history would prove, shrugged Mr. Xu, the Deputy Mayor. "It would have been impossible," he said, for Mr. Deng to have gambled with an economic experiment in Shanghai only to see it fail. "To lose the experiment would be to lose perhaps 25 percent of China's G.N.P.," Mr. Xu said.
"But after the 1980's, and success in Canton, it was time for Shanghai," he added.
 
Canton Proved the Theory
 In April 1990, after a meeting of the Central Committee, the State Council removed the constraints on trade and investment that had kept Shanghai in an economic backwater.
The key players were Mr. Deng; Jiang Zemin, the new party secretary and former Mayor of Shanghai, and Zhu Rongji, a protege of Mr. Deng. Mr. Zhu took over the Mayor's office and quickly earned the nickname Mr. One Chop, as he began to reduce the number of "chops," or permits, that had been one of the many barriers to foreign investment. His brusque verbal style also "chops" down adversaries.
The special regulations that had enabled the coastal provinces to take off were extended to Shanghai: tax exemptions for enterprises doing business with foreign companies, tax holidays for new factories set up with foreign investment and a bonded zone, the largest in China, for duty-free imports of raw materials. For its part, the central Government said it would help pay for a vast modernization of public works.
That was three years ago, and Mr. Deng was still struggling against party ideologues who opposed reform, especially as China coiled itself in isolation after the Tiananmen Square massacre of pro-democracy campaigners in June 1989.
But because the first economic experiments in Canton, Zhejiang, Fujian and Hainan provinces were wildly successful, Mr. Deng could push ahead.
 
The Problems
Up-Front Costs, Long-Term Saving
 Whether Shanghai can rival its position of old is a much contested question.
Some foreign investors have begun to complain that the city is gouging new arrivals by more than doubling the price of long-term leases in industrial zones and by failing to rein in the bloated bureaucracy.
Though foreign investment still seems to be rushing in, a number of companies have reportedly considered Shanghai and rejected it, citing the tactics of greedy bureaucrats.
Still, the city's vigorous Mayor, Huang Ju, likes to point out that while Shanghai stood by in the 1980's, it attracted only $3.3 billion in foreign investment. But with the establishment of a "special economic zone" here, that same sum arrived in a single year, 1992. And 1993 is headed off the charts, with $6 billion in foreign investment in the first 10 months.
But Shanghai is entering a cutthroat Asian market of cheap labor and tax breaks.
And if one thing is certain, Shanghai is not getting any cheaper. With the stampede of Western and Asian corporations here, the price of prime office space has soared, making Shanghai the fifth most expensive office market in the world. Corporate executives are working out of closet-sized spaces and Western-style, two-bedroom apartments go for $8,000 a month or more.
Though wages in Shanghai are equivalent to turn-of-the-century wages in the United States, they have doubled since 1990 and quadrupled since 1985. That is the city commissars' biggest worry, the Deputy Mayor says.
 
The Topography
From Rickshaws To Subways
 But costs aside, almost nothing could begin without the foundations of a modern city.
Shanghai is a city laid out for rickshaws. "Modernization" under Communism replaced them with seven million bicycles and 300,000 cars, one-tenth the number of cars in New York City, but on Shanghai's antiquated roads, enough to choke the city with near-constant gridlock. An excursion across town can be a three-hour affair.
Now, nearly 24 months ahead of schedule, the city is putting the finishing touches on $14 billion worth of bridges, tunnels, freeways, ports and power plants. In part because inflation added 40 percent to the cost of the first 10 projects, Mr. Xu, the Deputy Mayor, said, "we wanted to speed up and finish them in three years instead of five years."
By next March, he said, the municipal government will be ready to begin the next phase, for $25 billion, to add a subway system, a second international airport, a container port, more tunnels, freeways, railroads, water and sewer facilities.
 
Relocation: Pluses and Minuses
 The 100,000 residents who are losing their homes to make room for new freeways and high-rises spend little time grumbling.
"Shanghainese seem incredibly patient with things that are problematic," said Kate McLean, an Australian business consultant and longtime resident of the city. "I think that on the whole, people are smart enough to know that you can't have certain changes without certain costs."
There is also the promise of better lives.
Wang Yi, a young man from Pudong who works in a cooking-oil factory and who will lose his house in January to road widening, said: "We know we will get apartments with gas and electricity and indoor plumbing, and this is good for our family. We just don't know when or where."
A migrant population of 2.5 million workers from neighboring provinces has surged into the city, where a million people work on construction projects that give the city its insomnolent night glow. Cranes, craters and the skeletal shells of office buildings, department stores, hotels and apartment blocks with names like Gold City and Nightless City are turning the old foreign concession areas on the West Bank of the Huang Pu into a nouveau riche sprawl.
The stock exchange is there, as are Shanghai's new millionaires, conspicuously consuming in the festival of boutiques and department stores along Nanjing Road.
 
Parties, but No Sycamores
 At night the young and the rich converge on J. J.'s, a high-tech disco built by foreign investors. Its nightly throb would scandalize the old Communists who made Shanghai's overindulgence the ideological whipping post for the political purges of the 1960's and 70's.
The Bund has been stripped of the 70-year-old colonnade of sycamores that stood guard over the facades of yesteryear. Now there is a windswept pedestrian esplanade overlooking the dangerously polluted Huang Pu.
The colossal concrete pylons to support the nearly completed ring road linking Shanghai's two new bridges march through densely populated downtown neighborhoods, crushing the traditional lilong houses, the tiny masonry-and-timber quarters, often set above a shop, that are the hallmark of working-class architecture here.
"The foreigners who come back to Shanghai and want to remember the old Shanghai might miss the things that were familiar to them," said Jiang Jianyun, the deputy editor of The Shanghai Star.
She said residents of lilong houses do not find any nostalgia in bundling up each morning to lug their chamber pots down the street to collection points. "Those people who live in those lilong houses are very glad to be moving out because they are so crowded and the living conditions are so poor," she added.
 
The History
Capitalist Flower, Blooming Again
 Shanghai reached the zenith of power and allure in the first three decades of the century, dominating Asian trade when Hong Kong was a sleepy British outpost. More than 165 banks, including 58 branches of foriegn banks, operated on or near the Bund in the 1930's.
The expatriate merchants imported European architecture and society, living in mansions behind high walls in the concession areas they were granted in the declining years of the Qing Dynasty.
The masses of Chinese outside these walls suffered the instability of warlord rule, gang rivalry and political struggle between the underground Communist movement and the corrupt Nationalist Government.
Old Shanghai had opium dens, cabarets imitating Europe's best, pink gin, cigars and the Green Gang. Politics between the wars was sleazy, corrupt and dangerous.
 
Mao's Long Shadow
 The nascent Communist movement, which included young men like Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping, met furtively in safe houses, always fearing detection and massacre by the Nationalists under Chiang Kai-shek.
Shanghai's long decline began with the Japanese occupation in November 1937, followed by World War II and the civil war between the Nationalists and Communists in 1945-49. These conflicts drained the city of its foreign population and investment in a single chaotic exodus.
The Communist takeover in 1949 began four decades of mass social and economic experimentation under Mao; the political purges and mass movements he inspired deflated what capitalist spirit remained, leaving only a totalitarian hulk.
Today the focus of architectural preservation does not extend beyond the Bund, the old City Garden and the elegant villas of the former French concession.
"We will not allow anyone to destroy those buildings," said Mr. Xu, the Deputy Mayor. But, he added, much traditional architecture will come down and modern government-built apartments will go up on the outskirts.
"We will rebuild most of old Shanghai because the people want to improve their living conditions," he said.
 
Skyscrapers in the Paddy Fields
 Pudong, on the east bank, was an agricultural and industrial backwater until three years ago. It is now the future site of Shanghai's "Manhattan" and a huge free-export manufacturing zone.
More than 20 factories are rising behind fences marked with corporate logos like Siemens and Hitachi. Most of the new tenants are banking on tax concessions and duty-free imports of raw materials to assemble finished goods for export using Shanghai's cheap labor. "For all practical purposes," said Peter Topp, the supply manager for the largest joint venture in China, Shanghai Volkswagen, "the cost of labor in China is nothing."
Indeed, an important part of the economic strategy is once again to allow foreign corporations to exploit China's cheap labor market, just as foreign concessionaires did a century ago. But this time Shanghai will get a piece of the action through joint-ventures and the acquisition of technology. And many of the returning foreigners are foreigners only in name. By far the largest investment is coming from Hong Kong and Macao.
"The 50 million overseas Chinese are a little bit like the Jewish people who lost their country," Mr. Xu said. "Even though they are scattered across 100 countries for three or four generations, they are still Chinese people. They want to do something for their hometowns."

HEADLINE: Many Companies in Area Disillusioned by Accord

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
Though the New York metropolitan region has the largest concentration of international companies in the United States, it was left relatively untouched by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade signed in Geneva last week. And that's not necessarily good.
Provisions that would have helped industries vital to the region, particularly financial services and entertainment, were left out of the treaty that established new rules for international trade. Executives in those fields said that those omissions mean that the United States missed a rare opportunity to help the lagging economies of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. 
 "We think it is terrific that GATT was concluded, but we are also disappointed," said David Strongin, director of international finance for the Securities Industry Association, which represents stock brokerage and investment banking companies. "Our priority was greater market access, and that was not achieved."
 
Financial Services Must Wait
 The nation's manufacturers are expected to benefit almost immediately from the reduced tariffs on their exports that were agreed to in Geneva. Financial service companies had been hoping to benefit in much the same way -- by an easement in the severe government restrictions they face in opening branches, trading on foreign stock exchanges and acquiring subsidiaries in much of the world.
But when the agreement was reached in Geneva, the concerns of the financial services industry were simply put in abeyance. Although nothing in the accord assures that the restrictions imposed by foreign countries will remain, there is nothing for now that makes it easier for the region's financial service companies to do business abroad. Instead, GATT negotiators gave themselves 18 months to continue debating new rules for financial services.
The United States negotiators "did not succeed on the offense, but they put up a masterful defense," said John R. Price, a managing director and head of government relations at Chemical Bank, who worked with government negotiators in Geneva. When the trade talks neared their conclusion, Mr. Price said, his biggest fear was that the accord would formally sanction current policies, which allow many foreign governments to bar or restrict United States banks while their banks have open access to this country. Now, the negotiators will at least have time to concentrate on lowering these barriers.
The region's financial services companies were not the only businesses with an important stake in the trade talks. Though many manufacturers are happy that the agreement offers tariff reductions, some expressed deep disappointment over other some other results.
One such company is United Technologies Corporation, based in Hartford, a maker of elevators, helicopters and commercial jet engines.
Although United Technologies stands to benefit from increased global demand, a spokesman for the company, James Linse, said the sticking point in the Geneva accord came over questions critical to Pratt and Whitney, the United Technologies division that makes jet engines. Pratt and Whitney had hoped the accord would set strict limits on government subsidies to foreign aircraft makers.
Like the unresolved questions facing the financial services industry, the debate over the aircraft subsidies was put off, and the Geneva negotiators set no deadline to resolve the matter.
 
Entertainment Woes
 Among large companies in the region, the entertainment industry is perhaps the most dissatisfied with the GATT agreement.
"We are profoundly disappointed," said Timothy Boggs, vice president of Time Warner, a diversified producer of movies, television programs, records and publications. While the company's Hollywood subsidiary, Warner Brothers, suffered a harsh blow when the negotiators in Geneva gave in to French demands to continue government assistance to European movie makers, he said the company's television business, based in New York, will also be hurt.
That is because the GATT agreement allows "content quotas" for European television programming. The quotas mean that European TV stations must devote more than half their air time to programs made in Europe, a restriction that Mr. Boggs said will adversely affect United States television companies.
 
I.B.M. Is Upbeat
 Although executives across a wide spectrum of industries in the New York region said they hoped for more from the GATT agreement, few denied that that treaty will ultimately benefit them if it spurs increased economic development around the world, particularly in poor nations.
One company that considers itself a clear winner is the region's largest manufacturer, International Business Machines.
"GATT lays out a whole set of business options for us that were not there before," said Mark A. Holcomb, an I.B.M. spokesman.
But among other manufacturers in the region that rely heavily on their own research and technology, the GATT agreement has left much to be desired.
"Our reaction is mixed, at best," said Lou Clemente, senior vice president at Pfizer, the Brooklyn-based pharmaceutical company, which had hoped for tough new global requirements for patent protection. Like Merck and Company, Johnson & Johnson and a dozen other large New Jersey drug makers, Pfizer looses huge amounts through patent infringement in other countries.
The drug makers' complaints are not that patent protections are ignored by the GATT agreement, but that they are being delayed. Under the agreement, foreign governments, some of which now have no patent laws, are given 10 years to enact them.

HEADLINE: Gay Couples Ruled to Be 'Family Members'

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ALBANY, Dec. 21

 BODY:
New York State's highest court today upheld a state housing agency's authority to extend the definition of "family members" to include gay couples in matters concerning rent-regulated apartments.
The Court of Appeals, in a 6-to-0 ruling, said the Division of Housing and Community Renewal acted within its authority when it amended rent stabilization regulations to protect the rights of the surviving "life partner" of a deceased tenant. 
 In 1989 the Court of Appeals determined that "family member," when used in rent-control issues, included the roommate of a deceased tenant, provided there existed a long-term emotional and financial commitment, regardless of the sexes of those involved.
That ruling was hailed as a victory for New York City's gay community, which has been devastated by the AIDS epidemic. Many homosexuals whose partners had died of the disease were being evicted from rent-controlled apartments because existing laws didn't allow for them to inherit the property.

New Plan For Phone And Cable

BYLINE: By EDMUND L. ANDREWS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21

 BODY:
Vice President Al Gore outlined a broad plan today to overhaul the nation's telecommunications laws, but provided few details on how the Administration planned to tackle the devilishly divisive details.
As expected, Mr. Gore called for eliminating the legal barriers that now prevent cable television, local telephone and long-distance services from competing with one another. 
 But, in a speech to the National Press Club here, he also left room for continued regulation, expressing concern that the regional Bell telephone companies might still control "bottlenecks" to local telephone customers and could prevent full competition.
 
 
'Public Right of Way'
 Mr. Gore also said the Administration would push for measures to prevent the nation from being divided between "haves" and "have nots" in the information economy, and called for some sort of "public right of way on the information highway."
The Administration plans to issue a detailed legislative package on Jan. 11, at a speech the Vice President is scheduled to give in Los Angeles. Officials from the White House and the Commerce Department have been trying to work in cooperation with key members of Congress, who have introduced several bills that would relax or eliminate many legal barriers and permit greater competition.
But the Administration is still struggling to define its own role in fostering what it calls a "national information infrastructure," a high-speed network or networks to deliver two-way voice, video and data communications into homes and businesses.
It remained unclear today what the Administration intended to do to meet its goal of making advanced communications services available to schools, hospitals and ordinary citizens. Moreover, Mr. Gore offered no details on what kinds of safeguards would prevent a few big companies from dominating the nation's networks. Those issues represent a minefield of bitter disputes that could unhinge any reform effort, industry analysts say.
Thus far, private industry has been racing ahead of Washington on creating the data superhighway as cable, telephone and computer companies have rushed to build the components of advanced new networks. On a policy front, most of the initiatives so far have come from members of Congress, and Mr. Gore deferred to those lawmakers today by noting that they had done "a lot of the heavy lifting and achieved significant breakthroughs."
In the House, a bill co-sponsored by Representative Edward J. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, and Representative Jack Fields, a Texas Republican, would eliminate a law that now bars telephone companies from providing television services over their networks. In the Senate, Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii, has co-sponsored a similar bill with Senator John C. Danforth, Republican of Missouri.
Meanwhile, Representative John D. Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, has teamed up with a fellow Democratic Representative, Jack Brooks of Texas, on a bill that would loosen prohibitions that currently bar local Bell telephone companies from manufacturing equipment or entering the long-distance business.
 
 
Industry Consensus
 Perhaps because Mr. Gore refused to stray far from what is increasingly a consensus view within the industry about the need for telecommunications reform, today's speech generated little controversy.
The National Cable Television Association praised what it called the plan's "solid, comprehensive principles," a view echoed by the United States Telephone Association, which represents local telephone companies. Both the American Telephone and Telegraph Company and MCI Communications also praised the speech.
The speech also won support from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a nonprofit lobbying group formed to address civil liberties in new electronic media.

HEADLINE: MARKET PLACE;
Japan's Loan Sharks Make Good Money in Bad Times

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 21

 BODY:
Of all the battered sectors of the currently depressed Japanese economy, the business of lending money may be in the worst shape.
Banks are awash in bad debts. The stock market during the last four years has lost more than $3 trillion, equal in value to nearly half the gross national product of the United States. And nonbank finance companies have taken a shellacking on real estate lending. 
 So why does the market here love one of the oldest forms of money-lending -- loan sharks?
While loan sharks appall stuffy commercial banks, occasionally anger the police and even embarrass some customers, investors have found that these specialized consumer-loan companies have a knack for doing something their more prestigious rivals cannot -- make good money even in bad times.
Known here as sarakin, a contraction of the Japanese words for salaryman and cash, these companies provide workers and the downtrodden white-collar masses -- who, beyond family or friends, have traditionally had no place to go for fast cash -- with a range of cash needs, from covering gambling bets to meeting unusual medical expenses.
With improved technology like advanced automated teller machines, some can even offer loan approval on the spot -- a boon to consumers who might be put off by the more formal surroundings of banks, which have always focused on big corporations.
The average loan size at the large sarakin companies now is slightly less than 400,000 yen, or about $3,600. These are high-interest loans that require no collateral.
In the last several months, three of Japan's largest consumer-loan companies -- the ACOM Company, the Promise Company and the Sanyo Shinpan Finance Company -- have sold stock to the public on the over-the-counter market. They have outperformed the market at a time when it has been plunging. They also remain quite profitable.
"These companies are, in fact, quite good at what they do," said Alicia Ogawa, the financial analyst at Salomon Brothers Asia. "They fill a real need. The bigger banks haven't bothered with consumer lending until very, very recently because they always considered dealing with consumers sort of, you know, dirty."
As a result, the rates the sarakin have charged have been usurious. A decade ago they could legally charge 110 percent interest, about 10 times the prime lending rate at banks. Regulators have lowered that to 40 percent, about seven times the banks' prime lending rate. Actual loan rates run about 29 percent. "You can tolerate 2 to 3 percent loan losses if you're charging 29 percent interest," David Snoddy, an analyst here with Jardine Fleming Securities, said.
At one time, the sarakin were relegated to back alleys or the upper floors of out-of-the-way buildings so customers could avoid being seen. Many were affiliated with organized-crime groups and a scandal blew up in the early 1980's because of their unsavory, if effective, collection methods. Intimidation, harassment in the form of tirades outside deadbeats' homes, as well as outright violence, were all tools of the trade.
At least for the large companies, those days are gone. Sanyo Shinpan, for instance, boasts that nearly 90 percent of its 141 loan offices are on the ground floors of buildings.
Sanyo Shinpan also forbids its debt collectors to confront customers in person; contacts are made through the mail and telephone calls. Still, even a call can intimidate a reluctant borrower, since it is considered a humiliation to be known as a deadbeat to a sarakin.
Analysts say the sarakin still do a better job than most banks at managing loan portfolios. They are much faster to write off overdue loans and even better at collecting bad debts.
Sanyo Shinpan is the sixth-largest sarakin company. Shinichiro Maeda, an analyst at Nomura Securities, projected that the company would have a declining rate of bad loan write-offs, and that it would enjoy earnings growth of about 10 percent a year for the next few years, despite the dismal state of the economy.
In the fiscal year ending next March 31, Sanyo Shinpan is expected to post net profits of 8.2 billion yen, or about $74 million. On Tuesday, its stock closed at 14,100 yen, about $127, a share. That's below its offering price in September of 16,000 yen, but the decline has been at a slower rate than the overall market, which has dropped more than 20 percent.
Despite competition in consumer lending with the increased popularity of credit cards here, the sarakin have a strong niche because they are more efficient than banks.
For instance, banks usually close their automatic teller machines at 7 P.M. on weekdays and 5 P.M. on weekends. The sarakin keep their A.T.M.'s open 24 hours in most instances. Promise closes its automated tellers at 10 P.M., but uses the machines as mini-loan centers, where customers can talk to a video image of a company employee and arrange for a credit line on the spot.
In addition, the sarakin work at what is blinding speed by Japanese standards. According to Mr. Snoddy, sarakin can approve a loan in less than an hour. Mr. Snoddy is a fan of ACOM, in large part because it enjoys the highest return on equity, slightly less than 13 percent. Its stock closed at 9,300 yen, or roughly $83.78, a share today, a shade below its offering price last month of 9,500 yen.
Promise, the third sarakin to go public, is trading above its asking price in September of 7,980 yen. Shares closed at 8,300 yen, about $74.77, today.
"These are high-risk, high-reward stocks," Walter Altherr, an analyst at Merrill Lynch Japan, said. "But over the long term one has to believe these stocks will show better growth than the banks."

Dollar Gains Against Yen But Dips in Other Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled lower against most European currencies in subdued trading yesterday, but strengthened against the yen amid more talk that the Japanese central bank might cut interest rates early next year to stimulate the economy.
Lower interest rates would further undermine the yen by making yields on yen-denominated securities less attractive to investors. 
 Further, "the market is now really beginning to get nervous over the economic and political situation in Japan," said Stephen Flanagan, a vice president at Paine Webber Inc. "That's keeping the yen weak."
The market largely ignored comments by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who said he did not envision the United States' intervening to support the Japanese currency. Mr. Bentsen also said he was disappointed that so little progress has been made in opening Japanese markets to American goods.
In late New York trading, the dollar rose to 111.18 yen, from 110.62 yen on Monday.
The dollar was out of the spotlight most of the day. The Swiss franc drew strength as Europe's "safe haven" currency and moved higher. Mr. Flanagan noted that amid Germany's economic problems and growing disputes with labor, investors were inclined to abandon the German mark, and the Swiss franc has been the primary beneficiary.
"For the dollar at this time of year, it's more of a speculative market, and that means dealers are not necessarily trading the dollar," Mr. Flanagan said. Most dealers have settled their accounts and are awaiting the new year.
In New York, the dollar was quoted at 1.4503 Swiss francs, down from 1.4580, and at 1.7103 German marks, down from 1.7125.
The British pound rose to $1.4880 from $1.4860.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 5.8155 French francs, down from 5.8388; 1,669.00 Italian lire, down from 1,673.00, and 1.3449 Canadian dollars, up from 1.3438.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Copper Extends Its Rally To Hit a Three-Month High

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Copper prices, depressed earlier in the year by global recession and an oversupply, extended a recent rally to three-month highs yesterday. But many analysts viewed the 12 percent price rise since late October as a technical recovery in a weak market devoid of strong fundamentals.
"Funds, merchants, producers -- you name it -- everyone was short of copper," one analyst said. "It is the cutting back of those positions ahead of the year-end that has caused this rise." 
 Copper for March delivery gained 0.70 cent, to 82 cents a pound, the highest price since mid-September, at the Commodity Exchange in New York. Since March, prices have fallen from more than $1 a pound to a low of 73 cents.
Early yesterday, the London Metal Exchange, a key trading center and repository for base metals like copper, lead, zinc and nickel, reported that exchange copper inventories had dipped again. The total, 586,175 metric tons, is more than 4 percent below the late-September peak.
 
Far Eastern Demand Improving
 While some worry that there is still an oversupply of the metal, demand has improved in the United States and developing Far East economies, analysts said. But analysts said stocks might start to rise again if supplies from the former Soviet Union, which have been erratic recently because of crowded ports, began moving again.
Other metals prices were stagnant, with February gold down $1.50, to $389.30 an ounce, and March silver 4.5 cents lower at $5.097 an ounce.
On other commodity markets, energy prices eased in trading ahead of a weekly report on domestic inventories. Analysts were also keeping an eye on Arab oil ministers' talks, although there is increasing skepticism that Middle Eastern petroleum producers will cut back output to raise sagging prices.
February crude oil dropped 2 cents, to $14.36 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. January unleaded gasoline edged down 0.17 cent, to 39.38 cents a gallon, and January heating oil sank 0.39 cent, to 43.36 cents a gallon.

HEADLINE: Playing Politics Over Pork Exports

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
On Monday, the Russian ship Irbenskiy Proliv pulled into the port of Houston to pick up the last of about 24 million pounds of frozen American hog carcasses, cut into thirds and packed in boxes for shipment to Russia as a donation from the United States Government.
The ungainly slabs of raw meat, bones and fat, which cost American taxpayers $25 million, will be sold by the Russian Government to local manufacturers, who will use the meat in sausages to be sold at retail prices to Russian consumers. 
 This is the meager result of the American pork industry's two-year battle to win United States Department of Agriculture support for increased exports -- a top-level fight that ultimately was won when President George Bush, following pleas by a pork-farming friend, overruled his own Cabinet-level trade policy committee and approved the effort.
 
Corruption and Abuses Avoided
 The pork initiative was not afflicted by the corruption and regulatory abuses that have plagued the country's export credit programs in recent years -- violations that have ranged from kickbacks to foreign governments to the export of foreign goods disguised as American products. And the costs to the taxpayers are almost unnoticeable in a program that has already exceeded $40 billion during the last decade.
But if the country's costly export efforts are the sum of hundreds of small initiatives like this one, the American pork industry's bid for support illustrates how political pressures, rather than any thoughtful strategy, can dominate the country's trade programs.
It began in the summer of 1991, as the pork industry fretted that a growing hog population would cause prices to slump unless demand could be increased.
To raise demand, the National Pork Producers Council, an industry promotion group, advertised pork to health-conscious Americans as "the other white meat." And in 1989, it persuaded the Federal Government to donate surplus pork bellies to Poland -- a price-raising project that one Congressional critic compared to "sending ice to Eskimos."
By mid-1991, pork producers were looking to the former Soviet Union as a source of potential demand -- both through American Government subsidies and outright donations. "Russia is going to be a huge pork market for somebody," said Alan Tank, vice president for public policy and trade at the pork council. "It might as well be us."
In addition to encouraging Government donations of pork to Russia, the pork council wanted the meat to be eligible for the Federal export enhancement program, or E.E.P., which pays exporters a cash bonus to allow them to cut prices enough to compete in world markets. The export enhancement program, administered by the United States Department of Agriculture, was established to help protect America's share of world markets against Europe's subsidized farm exports.
 
A Boom in Exports
 In fact, American pork exports had boomed since 1986 without Federal trade subsidies. An industry-sponsored study last April by Abel, Daft & Earley, a consulting firm in Alexandria, Va., showed that American pork exports were already growing much faster than the exports of some heavily subsidized American crops.
Thus, the pork lobby faced an uphill fight to get export enhancement subsidies to sell pork to the Russians.
But on Nov. 8, 1991, the pork producers council announced at a press conference that Prodintorg, described as the "official buying agency" of the Soviet Government, "has formally requested 30,000 metric tons of U.S. pork as part of an additional agricultural credit package." That amount equaled nearly 40 percent of the pork exports in the previous year.
In fact, Prodintorg is just one of several procurement agencies still operating in Russia, and it did not have the power to negotiate trade subsidies. And despite the announcement, the Russian Government had not officially asked to use its existing American export subsidy credits for pork.Mr. Tank of the pork council blamed conflicts within the Russian Government and the Agriculture Department's refusal to force the Russians to use their existing trade credits for specific products for this omission.
Edward R. Madigan, who was the Secretary of Agriculture for President Bush at the time, defended his department's stance. "I couldn't just order them to buy it," Mr. Madigan said. "I couldn't set that precedent, or there'd be no end to it."
Besides the lack of strong evidence that pork exports were suffering in the absence of subsidies, Mr. Madigan said his staff felt the Russians preferred to buy subsidized feed grains for their own livestock -- an argument, Mr. Tank said, that reflected the Agriculture Department's "70-year-old thinking" and the political power of America's corporate feed-grain exporters.
In any case, the department's refusal to grant the subsidies ignited a political brush fire in Iowa and other key pork-producing states. Their Congressional representatives wrote Mr. Madigan almost weekly to protest the decision -- and in 1992, the Presidential campaign increased the heat.
"I had Terry Brandsted telling me that there was a chance the President could carry Iowa, but that this was an explosive issue out there," Mr. Madigan said, referring to the Republican Governor of Iowa. "I had the Iowa Congressional delegation on my back. I just wanted to put out this fire."
Mr. Madigan said he finally agreed to seek Cabinet approval for the subsidies. However, when the issue came before the Cabinet's Trade Policy Review Group, which must review such proposals, Mr. Madigan met opposition from the State Department, the Council of Economic Advisers and the Office of Management and Budget. Those agencies would not comment on the internal debate.
But Mr. Madigan said he recalled that the economists and the budget office had argued that the subsidies were an unwise use of tax revenues, while the State Department had opposed subsidizing products that competed with pork exports from the struggling democracies in Eastern Europe. In March 1992, the committee turned down the American pork industry's request.
Then, the industry pulled out its heaviest artillery: Roy B. Keppy, a third-generation pork farmer from Eldridge, Iowa, and a close friend of President Bush. Mr. Keppy, whose son Glen was an officer of the pork council and President Bush's chief farm fund-raiser in Iowa, said Mr. Bush "has sat in my La-z-Boy chair a couple of times" during visits to the farm. Mr. Keppy agreed in April to personally ask the President for the subsidies.
 
Bush on the Line
 "One day the telephone rang and Mrs. Keppy went to the phone," Mr. Keppy said. "And he said, 'Good morning, this is President Bush.' And I wasn't there! So he called back later."
According to Mr. Keppy, his friend seemed to think that the pork subsidies had already been approved. "How do you tell the Commander in Chief that he's wrong?" Mr. Keppy said. "But I did, and he went to work on it and helped us."
Mr. Madigan confirmed that after the telephone conversation the President called him to discuss the subsidies. "I told him I had been trying to persuade the people on the Trade Policy Review Group," Mr. Madigan recalled. "He said, 'Just go ahead and offer it.' So we did."
Mr. Bush declined to comment. However, Mr. Tank of the pork council said Mr. Keppy was the key to reversing the Cabinet committee's decision. "If anyone understood the importance of pork in Iowa, it was George Bush," he said.
 
Trade Sidetracked
 Pork was made eligible for export enhancement subsidies for one year, starting in August 1992.
But the decision did not lead to a thriving subsidized pork trade with the Russians. The attempted coup in August 1992 threw Moscow into disarray. Then, the Russian Government defaulted on loans granted under other American export credit programs. And, in early 1993 Russian officials raised questions about meat inspection practices in the United States.
According to Mr. Tank, American officials failed to respond promptly to the Russians' meat inspection concerns -- a criticism that department officials have denied. In any case, last April the Russians banned American pork products until the inspection issue was settled.
By the time the ban was lifted, in midsummer, the export subsidies were about to expire, Mr. Tank said. A few transactions were reviewed by the Agriculture Department, he added, but were turned down without explanation.
 
Money for Social Aid
 Although no subsidized transactions took place, the Agriculture Department, in response to the industry pressure, bought the 24 million pounds of pork that are now being donated to the Russian Government through the department's Food for Progress program.
Officials in Moscow said the Government's sale of the pork for processing into sausages would generate money for social aid programs.
Stephen Neel, the director of technical services and research at the United States Meat Export Federation, a trade association, conceded that shipping unprocessed hog carcasses was not the best way to show that America's hams and bacon were superior to European products. But he said the federation would try to insure that Russian consumers knew the sausages contained American pork. "We're trying to make the best of the situation," Mr. Neel said.
Even Mr. Keppy conceded that the Russians "aren't quite prepared for large shipments of pork" because of inadequate refrigeration facilities. "But the pork council is trying to work on that," he said.
Undaunted, Mr. Tank said he was trying to get the export subsidies for pork renewed. But history is repeating itself: The Agriculture Department has approved the renewal, but the Trade Policy Review Group has once again objected that the subsidies cost too much and accomplished too little.

HEADLINE: To Sip, Perchance to Steam

BYLINE: By BRYAN MILLER

 BODY:
LIKE a fragrant gulf breeze, the steamy, seductive aroma of freshly ground coffee beans is caressing New York City.
With names like the Coffee Experience, French Roast Cafe, New World Coffee and Seattle Bean Company, these sleek caffeine canteens are introducing -- some might say addicting -- New Yorkers to potent espresso, ristretto (a short super-intense espresso), cappuccino (half coffee, half steamed milk with foam) latte (espresso with steamed milk and a touch of foam), caffe mocha (espresso with steamed chocolate milk), macchiato (espresso with a dollop of milk foam) and more. 
 For all their snazzy decors, impressive displays of coffee beans and hulking steam machines that pack enough power to propel a Toyota station wagon, coffee quality is widely uneven in the cafes. A recent sampling of 15 establishments revealed that it takes more than good equipment and high-quality beans to make a well-balanced espresso or cappuccino.
Espresso bars were strangely late in coming to New York, this most energizing of cities, where for decades citizens have been content with acrid, watery brews served in cardboard cups adorned with Greek motifs. One might think that hyperkinetic New Yorkers need more caffeine about as much as Arnold Schwarzenegger needs more muscles. Nonetheless, they are taking to the new boutique Java like deer to a salt lick.
"We have people come in two, three or more times a day," said Talitha Whidbee, manager of Philip's Coffee on West 56th Street in Manhattan. "We have one man who comes in six times a day." Customers typically start in the morning with espresso or cappuccino, she said, then later in the day move on to drinks with more milk in them, like latte.
The settings of the new coffee bars vary as much as the quality of the brew. Some, like Philip's Coffee and the nearby Jonathan Morr Espresso Bar, on the Avenue of the Americas near 56th Street, are mere slivers of real estate. They are nooks, done in provocative colors with lots of brushed steel, marble and sharp-looking designer lights. At Jonathan Morr, even the trash can is illuminated in ice-blue neon.
Other bars are bigger, with small seating areas in the back, where customers read newspapers, study or just stare into space to the sound of classical music. Eureka Joe, in the Flatiron district, has a spacious back room with white fabric-covered armchairs and sofas; New World Coffee, a much smaller establishment, in Greenwich Village, plays sleepy Gregorian chant -- perhaps in an attempt to counteract the caffeine.
Many of the espresso bars are in the lobbies of office buildings, where they set up aromatic trawlnets to snag arriving workers before they reach the elevator. Usually offered are scones, beignets, muffins, pastries and sandwiches. But don't look for bagels and cream cheese: they don't make it with marble counters and Vivaldi.
With more than two dozen new coffee bars in the city and many more on the way, the European-style coffee house is almost surely more than just a passing fad. Seattle-based Starbucks Coffee, the General Motors of espresso, has 270 coffee bars across the country, with plans to open 125 more next year. The first New York Starbucks is planned for the spring.
All this coffee excitement has energized the once-dominant Chock Full o'Nuts to get back into the act, too. The company, which once had 110 coffee shops and restaurants, mostly in the New York metropolitan area, closed its last outlet in 1983. Its memory is kept alive as a brand of coffee on supermarket shelves. Chock Full o'Nuts plans to open at least five coffee bars in New York City next year, and foresees up to 70 in the future.
"This is a major commitment," said Marvin Haas, the company's vice chairman and chief executive. Mr. Haas attributes the coffee-bar explosion in part to the bad economy. "Espresso, cappuccino and latte are inexpensive treats," he reasoned, things people historically turn to when bigger treats are unattainable.
Lavazza (pronounced la-VAHT-sa), a major coffee brand in Italy, has just opened coffee training centers in New York, Boston and Seattle. Meant both for consumers and for people in the business, they offer classes on coffee beans and the proper use of espresso machines.
For making good coffee, fresh beans are critical, as is the type of grind. Rancid beans yield sour coffee. If the coffee is exceedingly bitter -- a mild bitterness is desirable -- chances are coffee was overextracted, that is, exposed to forced hot water for too long. Other causes could be too fine a grind or a dirty machine.
In hot, humid weather coffee beans sweat oil; in dry weather they contract. The changing conditions require periodic adjustments to the grind. Ms. Whidbee at Philip's Coffee said that on humid summer days she adjusts the grind 10 times or more.
Another variable is the tamp, or the pressure with which coffee is packed into the filter. One quick way to assess the quality of a coffee bar is to observe the workers. A wham-bam, careless attitude is a signal to turn and walk out.
A well-made cappuccino should have equal parts espresso and steamed milk with foam. The foam should be creamy and dense, not full of evanescent bubbles. If the foam is fragile and airy, chances are skim milk was used.
The recent tour of cafes showed that there was not always a correlation between price and quality. The price of a small espresso ranged from $1.25 to $2. The better cafes serve coffee in porcelain cups, which makes a difference; inexplicably, some of the most stylish places -- those that have spent lavishly on decor and equipment -- serve their coffee in cardboard cups.
Many factors enter into the prices charged by coffee bars around town. Aside from overhead, there is the cost of the beans themselves, which can range from about $1.20 to $5 a pound wholesale. So far, at least, New Yorkers aren't balking at paying up to $3 for a trendy new treat.

HEADLINE: A Safety Net for Russian Reform

 BODY:
Russians voted their fears, pain and anger 10 days ago when they turned toward anti-reform demagogues in surprising numbers. The West cannot cure Russia's distemper with the promise that better days are sure to follow if only Moscow will move quickly to a market economy. It must provide aid, and soon, so that Boris Yeltsin's reformers can protect Russia's most vulnerable citizens from the wrenching dislocation of economic reform.
Economic recovery in Russia means shutting down mammoth military, steel and other factories that produce little of value. In time, investment can be redirected into housing and consumer products that Russians crave. But the unemployed, the displaced military and pensioners cannot wait. Only when they are taken care of can President Yeltsin's reform Government survive. 
 The value of this aid cannot be oversold in the way the West originally sold the virtues of rapid reform. This means being honest with ordinary Russians -- as well as American taxpayers, who will be asked to foot the bill -- about the fact that Russia inevitably faces at least several more years of tough times as the price of seven decades wasted under a command economy.
That said, Western aid must flow far faster than it has. So far, the International Monetary Fund has failed to get the job done. President Clinton and other leaders of the industrialized nations must take over from I.M.F. technocrats and prepare a package of aid for delivery when Mr. Clinton meets Mr. Yeltsin next month. In return, Mr. Yeltsin must provide a credible program of economic reform. Binding commitments at the top are needed to help the desperate people on Russia's streets.
The leading industrialized powers had the I.M.F. oversee half of a $28 billion aid package conditioned on Russia's undertaking market reforms. Befitting its traditions, the I.M.F. insisted that reform precede the release of most aid. As a result, the I.M.F. has provided only $1.5 billion. This did little to nourish Russia's pro-Western reformers. The I.M.F. now says it might loosen its preconditions. But that will not be enough.
Mr. Clinton must round up support for a different imperative: Russia's reformers can't win over a fearful population unless they have money before they undertake reform. Reform requires closing down unneeded factories. But in Russia, the factory means more than a job for life. It is a source of housing, food and pensions. That's why fear of failing factories drives Russians to despair -- and reaction.
So Russia's leaders are trying to keep those factories going by printing rubles instead of moving ahead with reform. But that has driven the economy to the brink of hyperinflation. It is this reckless money creation, not the barely begun reforms, that has pummeled Russia's economy. Western aid would help finance a safety net for the unemployed and pensioners with hard currency, eliminating the argument for printing rubles.
In return, Mr. Yeltsin would have to pledge that a credible economic plan would follow. The West need not care how Russia reforms except to insist it move toward markets on a financially feasible path. That means the budget deficit must be closed fast enough to keep inflation in check.
But as Mr. Yeltsin's slowdown of reform shows, the pledge is politically risky since shrinking the deficit means cutting subsidies to factories. The two-way pledge is also risky for Mr. Clinton. He would commit U.S. money on little more than Mr. Yeltsin's promise. But the parliamentary elections make clear that the risk is worth taking. No society has transformed itself without outside help. If the West forces Russia to try, the likely outcome is social turmoil and political reaction.

HEADLINE: Wanted: A Cabinet of Taxpayers

 BODY:
Of course, the White House knew it was asking the public and Congress to accept a double standard in nominating Bobby Ray Inman as Secretary of Defense. That's why the public was kept in the dark for four days about what President Clinton has known for weeks.
For seven years Mr. Inman has failed to pay Social Security taxes on his housekeeper's wages. His failure continued throughout a year in which thousands of Americans, alerted by Zoe Baird's experience, voluntarily began payments. 
 Ms. Baird, whose problem was complicated by the fact that she employed an illegal alien and broke a law she would have to enforce, withdrew as the nominee for Attorney General. The issue of taxes for domestic workers also helped derail the nomination of Federal Judge Kimba Wood for the Attorney General's post, even though Ms. Wood broke no law. But the White House thinks it can save its male nominee from being judged as sternly as the two women.
So they have resorted to some transparent tricks. First, in the initial announcement, Mr. Clinton was portrayed as almost desperately needy of a seasoned national security expert who could keep the generals in line. Moreover, by announcing the appointment last Thursday -- without the full facts -- the White House counted on a long weekend of stories aggrandizing Mr. Inman and underscoring the President's yearning for a strong hand at the Pentagon.
Then, once the country had gotten used to the reassuring prospect of Secretary Inman, came the disclosure that Mr. Inman had a small "Baird problem." But this time it's not supposed to be fatal because he told on himself early enough and hired no illegal aliens. The entire production, with its lack of candor and cunning play of the news cycles, bears the stamp of David Gergen, a skilled perfumer of rank public-relations problems.
But the public should not let Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gergen keep slip-sliding along. This is a big country full of talented people. The Cabinet can and ought to be filled with that category of talented people who pay taxes. If it was right to dump Ms. Baird -- and it was -- how can it be right to look the other way for Admiral Inman?
The Zoe Baird affair gave Mr. Inman plenty of time to put his books in order. The White House's explanation for his delay is disingenuous. It says Mr. Inman did not pay his back taxes because he was waiting to see if legislation pending in Congress would relax the $50 per quarter standard, substantially raising the threshold for taxable earnings.
In other words, Mr. Inman was selectively ignoring the law until it changed in his favor. It may be an economical way to do business, but it is not an example of Cabinet-level civic leadership.

HEADLINE: How Tenure Safeguards Academic Freedom

 BODY:
To the Editor:
What you neglect in "Amid Joblessness, the Joys of Tenure" (The Week in Review, Dec. 12) is that abolition of tenure would radically change the character and qualifications of college and university faculties. Young people now typically spend five or six years earning a doctorate in the subject to be taught. Why would they do so if their training could be rendered useless by some administrator who decided that they, having reached age 40, were "dead wood"? 
 Accountants or lawyers who are fired in their 40's or 50's have a decent chance of continuing their professions elsewhere. There are hundreds of thousands of jobs for those occupations. But in the entire New York metropolitan area, there may not be a dozen jobs for a specialist in 18th-century French literature or Aristotelian philosophy. To fire such a person would be like disbarring a lawyer or denying a physician the right to practice medicine.
No one would advise a young person to make such an investment of time and effort without the security of tenure; college faculties would therefore come to be made up of generalists with bachelor's or perhaps master's degrees, people who could move easily back and forth between higher education and business without serious financial loss.
You also imply that academic freedom no longer needs the protection of tenure. You neglect the very real pressures that ethnic, religious and other groups can apply.
My own courses on the history of Christianity have been criticized by the religious right; and were it not for tenure, my university might be tempted to tell me to modify them. And I, a 60-year-old historian who is paid, after 30 years of teaching, about what many beginning lawyers are paid, would probably be frightened enough to do so. The prospect of being unemployed at this stage in my life would make me exceedingly eager to please everyone.

HEADLINE: C.I.A. Doubtful on Serbian Sanctions

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21

 BODY:
In a new assessment, the Central Intelligence Agency has concluded that the economic embargo imposed on Serbia 18 months ago is likely to deteriorate and that the West will probably have to accept the ethnic partitioning of Bosnia and Herzegovina.
In the analysis, the C.I.A. also says that there appears to be "no good and politically viable alternative" to the Serbian President, Slobodan Milosevic, who has been accused in the West of starting the ethnic violence that followed the breakup of the old Yugoslav federation. 
 He is "probably the only Serb leader the West can deal with and the only one capable of delivering a comprehensive solution" to the Bosnian crisis and Serbia's conflict with Croatia, the agency said.
The analysis was completed early this month, before the elections on Sunday in which Mr. Milosevic's party gained seats in the Serbian Parliament.
 
Division of Bosnia
 The Bush and Clinton Administrations have supported an integral Bosnia and Herzegovina, and have backed United Nations economic sanctions against Serbia to punish it for its role in the war in Bosnia. The Serbian Government has supplied the Serbian forces that have taken control of about two-thirds of Bosnia. Croatia, which has seized about 20 percent of the country, has avoided international economic sanctions.
A document drawn from the assessment, called a National Intelligence Estimate, says it will be "difficult or impossible to undo" the large population shifts that resulted when hundreds of thousands of Muslims, Serbs and Croats were driven from their homes in the fighting.
Last week, David Kanin, the C.I.A.'s chief analyst for Yugoslavia, alluded to plans by Serbian and Croatian leaders to annex portions of Bosnia and Herzegovina and to the prospect that Kosovo, an ethnically Albanian province of Serbia, will one day become part of Albania.
"I believe we are moving toward a greater Serbia, a greater Croatia and a greater Albania as result of this war," Mr. Kanin said during a roundtable discussion at the Woodrow Wilson Center, an arm of the Smithsonian Institution here. "The issue is whether to manage it or ignore it."
"We are not trying to manage it," Mr. Kanin said. "We're just ignoring it."
 
Not View of Agency
 Apprised of Mr. Kanin's public remarks, Kent Harrington, the C.I.A. director of public affairs, said: "We encourage our analysts to participate in academic discussions, but when they do they speak as individuals and do not represent intelligence views. Mr. Kanin's remarks were no exception."
Mr. Kanin's view is also contained in the written intelligence estimate, which sees Croatia absorbing parts of Bosnia and Herzegovina and recovering some of Krajina, the area in Croatia that it lost to Serbs in 1991. It sees Serbia acquiring parts of Bosnia now held by Bosnian Serbs and part of Krajina. In addition, it forecasts that Albania might ultimately gain Kosovo and perhaps even some areas of Western Macedonia inhabited by ethnic Albanians.
The intelligence estimate appears to have prompted no reconsideration of United States policy on Bosnia.
"There is no debate on these issues," said a top-ranking State Department official who has read the C.I.A. assessment and who is involved in policymaking on the former Yugoslavia. "Sanctions are not a major policy issue. We don't question the boundaries of Kosovo. We are not in the business of redrawing borders."
 
Breakup of Yugoslavia
 The new assessment is not the first time the Central Intelligence Agency has confronted a gulf between its assessment of the Yugoslav situation and the attitude of Government policy makers. In November 1990, the agency completed an analysis predicting -- accurately -- that the Yugoslav federation would collapse as early as the summer of 1991 and that civil war could ensue. But Bush Administration policymakers chose not to act upon this assessment.
Yugoslavia began to fall apart in June 1991 when Slovenia and Croatia seceded from the federation, and fighting broke out immediately.
In its assessment, the C.I.A. says the sanctions are likely to deteriorate in coming months because Serbia's neighbors are no longer willing to bear the economic sacrifices entailed in enforcing them: severe restrictions on Danube River traffic and the closure of vital rail and road connections between the Middle East and Northern Europe.
Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, Hungary, Macedonia and Ukraine have complained bitterly in recent months to the United Nations that the sanctions are costing them billions of dollars' worth of trade and industrial production. The European Union has proposed easing the sanctions in exchange for territorial concessions by the Bosnian Serbs to the Muslim-led Bosnian Government.
But Administration policymakers remain uniformly in favor of maintaining sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro, its small partner in the truncated Yugoslav federation. Some even wish to tighten the embargo still further, according to officials involved in the policy process.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 22, 1993, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
 An article yesterday about intelligence assessments of the military and political situation in Bosnia reported that the C.I.A. had concluded that the economic embargo imposed on Serbia 18 months ago was likely to deteriorate, and that the West would probably have to accept the ethnic partition of Bosnia. It cited several passages from what it described as a formal C.I.A. National Intelligence Estimate to support those generalizations.
After the article appeared, a C.I.A. spokesman said the excerpts obtained by The Times were not from a National Intelligence Estimate, but from a C.I.A. memorandum about a symposium at which divergent views on Bosnia's future were expressed. The Times should have tried to verify that the document represented a C.I.A. conclusion.
A corrective article appears on page A6.

HEADLINE: Times and New York City Reach Final Accord on New Plant

BYLINE: By TOM REDBURN

 BODY:
The New York Times reached final agreement yesterday with New York City to build a $280 million printing plant in Queens, clearing the way for construction to begin as early as next summer on what would be one of the largest manufacturing centers in the city.
The Times, which opened a major printing plant in Edison, N.J., early in 1992 and had considered moving all of its printing operations out of New York City, will build the Queens printing and distribution plant on 31 acres in the city-owned College Point industrial park just west of the Whitestone Expressway. 
 The city and the state agreed to grant The Times a package of tax incentives, low-cost energy and other benefits worth a total of $29 million over 25 years.
The incentives offered by the city and the state to The Times are larger, in proportion to the number of jobs involved, than comparable incentive packages given recently to other major New York corporations, like Morgan Stanley, Prudential Securities and CBS Inc., city officials said.
 
Capital Investment
 Several recent academic studies have criticized the city and the state for relying excessively on incentives aimed at large companies as a central component of their economic development strategies.
But city officials said they believed that such incentives were necessary to help stem the loss of jobs and companies from New York. They also argued that the higher cost of the agreement with The Times was justified because of the substantial capital investment it plans to make in the new plant and because skilled factory jobs are particularly hard to retain in New York.
"The city places a tremendous value on our manufacturing jobs," said Karen Backus, a senior vice president at the New York City Economic Development Corporation. "The site is extremely tough to build on and these incentives were absolutely critical."
The decision by The Times to build its new printing plant in Queens will provide as much as $115 million in benefits to the city and the state, Ms. Backus said. These benefits include the rent that The Times is to pay for the land, direct and indirect taxes to be paid by the company and its production employees, and other related gains.
Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, chairman and chief executive officer of The New York Times Company, said, "We are particularly pleased to keep New York's largest newspaper manufacturing operation right here where it belongs -- in New York City."
Construction will start only after The Times board of directors gives its approval to the project.
 
Variety of Tax Benefits
 The agreement calls for The Times to receive a variety of tax benefits, including stabilized real-estate taxes valued at $5 million over 25 years, a 12-year tax credit for each relocated job, worth $1.1 million, and a $4.8 million exemption from sales taxes on construction materials. A preliminary agreement was first announced in November 1992.
Lower power costs and money to prepare the site, which is now used as a police evidence lot for automobiles, are also included.
The Times employs about 1,000 people in press and delivery operations for the daily newspaper at its corporate headquarters, at 229 West 43d Street in Manhattan. The printing and distribution operations there will be shifted to College Point, where The Times plans to install advanced high-speed color printing presses. Company officials said they did not know how many people would work at the new plant.
The business and news operations of The Times, which employ about 2,000 people, will remain at the 43d Street headquarters, just west of Times Square.

HEADLINE: U.S. Gives Haiti's Military Rulers a New Deadline

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
The United States warned Haiti's military rulers today that it would expand an embargo against the country unless they stepped aside by Jan. 15 and allowed the exiled President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, to return to power.
The current embargo applies only to oil and arms. American officials said it could be widened to include restrictions on flights to and from Haiti, as well as other commerce that is not considered vital to sustaining the country's population. 
 The Clinton Administration threatened to tighten the sanctions after the leader of Haiti's armed forces, Lieut. Gen. Raoul Cedras, refused to meet with military officials from the United States, Canada, France and Venezuela who had flown to Haiti to talk with him today.
"We regret that General Cedras did not take advantage of this opportunity," said David Johnson, a State Department spokesman.
 
Urge Military Urged to Step Down
 The representatives from the four nations had planned to urge General Cedras to step down and to agree to a retraining program for Haiti's security forces so that the country's police and army would not stand in the way of a return to democracy.
After General Cedras failed to meet with them, they distributed the warning to reporters.
In a statement issued jointly with the governments of Canada, France and Venezuela, the United States called on General Cedras to honor an agreement that he signed in July to give up power and allow the return of Father Aristide, who was ousted in a coup in September 1991.
The four nations suggested that the embargo be tightened so that it would be observed not only by members of the Organization of American States but by all members of the United Nations as well.
 
Advice for Aristide
 The four countries, working closely with the United Nations Secretary General, also had some recommendations for Father Aristide, who has been living in exile in Washington since he was deposed. They urged him to step up efforts to build a broad coalition with Haitian lawmakers to open the way for a return to democratic rule.
The four nations also pressed Father Aristide to support a conference that Robert Malval, who is serving as a caretaker Prime Minister after he resigned as Father Aristide's hand-picked head of government, had tried to assemble to foster political reconciliation in Haiti.
Mr. Malval, who was appointed by Father Aristide in August, has criticized the exiled President for refusing to support the conference. Mr. Malval insists that such a meeting is needed so that a broader coalition can be formed to stand up to military pressure.
The four nations said that such a coalition was especially important because no political party has a majority in either chamber of Haiti's Parliament.
 
Aristide Plans Statement
 A public relations firm representing Father Aristide said that it planned to issue a statement on his behalf on Thursday.
The statement from the United States and the other nations warned General Cedras that he was not only violating the accord he signed in July calling for a restoration of democratic rule but was largely to blame for the growing economic deterioration.
The embargo imposed upon Haiti has created immense privation for the population. Clinton Administration officials say they hope that the fuel shortage created by the embargo will squeeze the military rulers so severely that it will force General Cedras and his supporters to relinquish power within a few weeks.
The statement said the military was responsible for arming hostile civilian groups and for preventing the docking of a military mission, which included American soldiers, that the Haitian military had officially accepted to help retrain its forces.
The four nations said the military should do far more to prevent individuals who are not in the police or military from carrying weapons. Armed sympathizers of the military known as attaches have terrorized supporters of Father Aristide.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From an Interview With President Clinton Reviewing the Year

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a year-end interview with President Clinton today by reporters from four news services:
Q. How about all the stories from Little Rock, the state troopers, their allegations? How do you feel about it, and are they true? What can you say? 
 A. Well, obviously it hasn't been a pleasant thing, especially coming here at the holiday season. But we put out a very strong statement about it, and I don't really have anything to add to what has been said in our written statement or what Hillary said yesterday.
Q. Mr. President, there's something new now in the allegations. Now there are allegations that public funds might have been used, public employees to do something that was improper. Are you ready to deny that that happened?
A. The statement covers that. There was an allegation about offering a job, too, and that's the only thing I think I should specifically say because it affects my role as President. We've already put out a statement about it. But I want to reaffirm that, that that absolutely did not happen.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
On Removal of Files
 Q. How about the Whitewater files that were taken from Vince Foster's office? If the investigators want to see those files, will you let them look at them? There's some reason to believe that they want to see them.
A. Of course we'll do what we can to cooperate on that. Now, let me say I don't know what's in that file. But I asked about that when I saw the news stories, and let me say what I understand the circumstances to be just to make sure. (Addresses aides in the room) And if I make a mistake you guys can correct me. But literally I don't know what's in the file and haven't looked at it. But when -- after Vince committed suicide and the authorities, the people came in to investigate, as they should have done, all the files were still in the office. There were no files, it's my understanding, removed or anything like that. But they were broken into three categories. The bulk of them were the files that he was working on which were then obviously distributed to others in the office.
Then he had some personal files which were turned over to his family, his personal lawyer.
Then he had this one, and I don't know that there are any more. But there was this file which related to work he had done before he came to work at the White House on our behalf, which was given to our counselor after the investigation. There was never any indication that anyone wanted to see it.
Obviously if anybody feels that there's some relevance to any ongoing investigation, we'll do what we can to cooperate.

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Do you feel there was any wrongdoing?
A. Let me just say this: we have no reason to believe at this time -- I read one of the stories today right before you came in -- I have no reason to believe at this time that anybody thinks there's anything in there relevant to any ongoing Federal matter. But if they do . . .
Q. So you've had the request?
A. No, we've had no request. To the best of my knowledge we haven't. But if anybody wants, thinks that we have some relevant information, then obviously we'll do what we can to cooperate.
I just want to emphasize this: I don't exactly know how this happened. But this Whitewater thing has -- we tried to deal with this back in the campaign. And when I got into this investment, Hillary and I did, it was a time when land values were going up and Arkansas retirees were flooding down there. It looked like a pretty good deal.
What happened was we had a big recession starting in 1980, land values went down, retirees didn't buy so much. And so I never thought much about it when we were clearly losing money and never knew until obviously the accountant closed the books out exactly how much we had lost.
In an attempt to sort of reassure people about this in the campaign we commissioned this independent accounting firm with whom I have never had any contacts or any dealings before or since to try to look at all these, what records we had, to at least ascertain how much money it cost us. Which is about all I thought we were in position to know since we hadn't been involved in running the company, didn't have access to all the records.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
On Highs and Lows
 Q. What have been the highs and lows of your year?
There have been an awful lot of highs this year.
Q. All at the tail end?
A. No, no, not at the . . .
Q, Except for the inauguration.
A: No, no, there were some in the beginning. Appointing Ruth Ginsberg to the Supreme Court happened fairly early. The passage of the budget plan happened early -- happened in August, but happened early by historic standards.
Yes, family medical leave. Yes, that was pretty quick. So there were a lot of highs, you know: the Middle East peace signing, the Nafta victory, the economic plan. There are a lot of highs. The national service day was a big high for me. So there were a lot of things that happened that were highs.
I think the low for me as President, obviously, was when the young men lost their lives in Somalia. That was the low point of the year.
Q. Mrs. Clinton said yesterday that no matter how much you talk to people about it, no matter how much you prepare for the job, that you can never truly be aware of everything that awaits you when you come into the White House. What has been your biggest surprise, what was your biggest surprise in your first year in office?
A. I think my biggest surprise, in a negative sense was -- I shouldn't have been surprised by it -- that coming here from another place and another way of doing things, there really is a Washington culture here that, on the one hand, needs to be changed, but on the other hand, has to be dealt with if you want to get anything done.

HEADLINE: Post Office Considers a 32 Stamp for '95, to Break Even

BYLINE: By KAREN DE WITT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
Even as Americans jam post offices to finish their holiday mailing, the Postal Service is working on a rate proposal that could raise the cost of a first-class stamp to 32 cents in 1995.
Postal Service officials said today that they needed to raise rates in 1995 for the service to break even, as it is required to do over a period of years. And because of the cumbersome process any increase entails, the service must make its request early in 1994, officials said. 
 Among the plans they are considering is an innovative across-the-board increase of 10.3 percent, which would add three cents to the cost of a first-class letter, the officials said. The idea is supported by businesses that make heaviest use of the mail.
The Postal Board of Governors will discuss the rate increase at a Jan. 3-4 meeting here.
 
No Higher Than Inflation
 "There are several options they are considering, but there is no final decision at this point," said Robert Hoobing, a spokesman for the Postal Service.
Whatever form the rate change takes, Postmaster General Marvin T. Runyon has said that he wanted to keep any rise under 14 percent, a cap that would put maximum first-class postage at 33 cents. The 14 percent figure, Mr. Hoobing said, is the estimated rate of inflation for the four-year period beginning in February 1991, when rates last went up. That increase was four cents, to 29 cents.
It would be the first increase of the first-class rate under Mr. Runyon, who took office in July 1992 with a pledge to break the service's tradition of raising that rate every three years. That tradition began in 1971, when the service was made a quasi-independent agency subject to Congressional oversight.
"There has to be an increase because we haven't had one in four years," said Norma Pace, an economist and a governor on the board of governors. "We have to have a rate increase for 1995 to help us break even."
The Postal Service, which generates revenues of $43 billion a year, is expecting a loss exceeding $1 billion for the fiscal year ending in September, Ms. Pace said.
According to the bureaucratic process that governs rate increases, the board of governors makes a recommendation for an increase, then gives an independent body, the Postal Rate Commission, 10 months to evaluate it.
Traditionally, the service has set different rates for various classes of mail, based on costs and overhead. The uniform 10.3 percent increase is favored by the largest users who think it would level off the impact of the rise and give Postal Service managers a chance to study a restructuring of the various classes of mail.
"It's an option that we especially like," said Arthur B. Sackler, managing director of the Mailers Council, a group of the nation's biggest mailers.
Officials said they were also considering smaller, more frequent increases.
Ms. Pace said the Postal Service still offered the best mail service in the world for its cost. First-class postage, for example, is as much as 25 cents higher in countries like Japan and Germany.
"From the tip of Florida to the uppermost tip of Alaska, it still cost the same 29 cents to send a first class letter," she said. "We're committed to maintaining that universal cost at the same time we've got to be extremely efficient."

HEADLINE: Palace of Toys Finds Profits Elusive

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Neither rain, nor sleet, nor snow nor the depths of recession seems to shorten the queue of people shivering outside the F.A.O. Schwarz flagship store in Manhattan during the holiday season, awaiting a chance to wander through the closest thing to Santa's workshop south of the North Pole.
The "toy" soldier standing at the main entrance salutes to more than 50,000 people each day at this time of year. Many are tourists who include the Schwarz store at Fifth Avenue and 58th Street on their itinerary in the same way they do the Empire State Building or the World Trade Center. 
 But despite its ability to delight and inspire with talking teddy bears, a Barbie boutique and $8,200 miniature gas-powered Mercedes cars, the world's most renowned toy store chain has trouble turning a profit. Sales at the 25 stores have marched steadily forward, more than tripling in the last decade and growing by 40 percent in the last two years alone. But when there were any profits in the last decade, they were small, and materialized only briefly between 1987 and 1989 before giving way again to red ink.
A succession of four owners between the early 1960's and 1986 threw up their hands at ever making money off of Schwarz, which was founded in 1862. The fifth, an investment group that backed Schwarz management in a buyout in 1986, and then sold the company in 1990, said the company turned a profit of as much as 5 percent of sales during its ownership, a figure the few analysts who follow the company question.
The analysts say the company's higher costs of business, including expensive real estate, and its singular quality make it difficult not only to make a profit but also to expand its operations. And in an era when low prices excite shoppers far more than interesting displays and wonderful ambiance, Schwarz must contend with competitors who can and often do undersell it.
"It's the classic problem of how can you have something unique on a mass scale," said Sean McGowan, a toy industry analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison & Company. "There's a certain amount of cachet to having an F.A.O. Schwarz shopping bag draped over your arm, but you destroy that if the enterprise gets too big."
It's a problem many other distinctive retailers have faced, including Barneys New York and Bergdorf Goodman. And Schwarz's sixth owner, the Dutch retailing conglomerate Koninlijke Bijenkorf Beheer, has so far had little better luck than its predecessors in solving the riddle. K.B.B. bought the company for more than $50 million in mid-1990.
A report on K.B.B. issued by Bank Van Haften LaBouchere earlier this year takes the Dutch retailer to task for losses at Schwarz, "which with hindsight should never have been bought, at least not at that time."
Nonetheless, an executive at K.B.B. told analysts last spring that the chain would turn an operating profit this year. And John Eyler, the president and chief executive of Schwarz, said in a recent interview that if the company manages to generate comparable-store sale gains of 10 percent this holiday season, it may eke out a small profit.
The Christmas season makes or breaks the year financially for Schwarz, as it does for almost all toy sellers. But holiday sales for retailers nationwide this year have come in wide swings -- one day strong, the next day weak -- making it difficult to predict how well the chain will do.
"I'll know on Christmas Eve," Mr. Eyler said last week.
Despite his cautious assessment of the holiday season, he was cheery enough to dance a jig that played "Chopsticks" on a Dance-On Piano in the waiting room at the corporate offices. The Dance-On keyboard, played with the feet, was made famous by Tom Hanks in the movie "Big." While the steel-framed version costs a cool $9,500, Schwarz now offers a $42 model that will not exceed the credit limit on most customers' charge cards.
 
A Three-Pronged Attack
 The cheaper Dance-On illustrates one of the strategies that Mr. Eyler and K.B.B. are pursuing to broaden the chain's appeal without damaging its franchise. A veteran of the specialty store business who joined the chain a year and a half ago, Mr. Eyler has started a three-pronged strategy that includes replacing the chain's small stores in shopping malls with larger "mini-flagships," increasing the amount of exclusive and less expensive merchandise, and trying to increase the amount of business Schwarz does outside the holiday season.
He is so confident of the chain's long-term prospects that he predicts that sales, which were about $67 million in 1992, will double by 1996, and says it may open at least six more United States stores and one abroad during that period. "We're in a period of growth and rejuvenation and success that may be a first for the company in a long time," he said.
To produce that kind of growth, he will have to find a way to leap the hurdles Schwarz has faced over the last two decades, say the few analysts and retail consultants who watch the company. While its flagship locations in New York, Chicago, Boston and San Francisco have been successful, Schwarz's other branch stores must begin to contribute to sales and profits. The chain must also counter Toys "R" Us and other toy sellers by offering one-of-a-kind merchandise. And Schwarz must try to build its business over the entire year to alleviate the pressure to produce in the fourth quarter.
Mr. Eyler and analysts agree that the biggest challenge is to find a store format, in addition to its 30,000- to 40,000-square-foot flagship stores, that will generate a profit. The 18 mall-based stores, some as small as 3,000 square feet, have not proved profitable, and more than one previous owner sold Schwarz after deciding that American shoppers would sustain three or four flagship stores but not a chain of smaller locations.
"We really foundered on the issue of format," said one former owner who spoke on condition of anonymity. "People were used to F.A.O. Schwarz in Manhattan, and that was what they expected in Atlanta and St. Louis and Chicago -- not some dinky mall store with pricey toys."
Mr. Eyler agrees: "We always tend to disappoint people who expect to find F.A.O. Schwarz on Fifth Avenue in their local mall."
His antidote? An 11,000-square-foot branch store that duplicates the flagship stores in the classes of merchandise it carries and in the mechanized toys and props used for display. The first mini-flagship opened in Seattle in July, complete with the mechanized clock that sings "Welcome to our world of toys" every seven and a half minutes.
Since then, Schwarz has opened other smaller flagship stores and plans to replace five or six mall stores with the new format in the coming year, he said. The new stores, Mr. Eyler contends, can produce a 15 percent return on investment on the same sales per square foot that it takes to break even in one of the smaller mall stores.
Mr. Eyler said he believed there was room for about 40 Schwarz locations in this country. Some might be smaller kiosk stores in airports, which would sell gift items and increase the company's year-round business. The company also plans to make its debut next year on a television shopping network.
Another hurdle for Schwarz is its costs. Its salaries and benefits alone eat up 18 percent of its revenues, according to Mr. McGowan, the Gerard Klauer Mattison analyst. In contrast, total expenses at Toys "R" Us -- including salaries, utility bills, advertising and rent -- cost 19 percent of its revenues.
The difference in costs means Toys "R" Us can easily undersell Schwarz. Video games that are sold at promotional prices by most toy retailers are always sold at the manufacturer's recommended price at Schwarz, Mr. McGowan said.
But Schwarz also suffers from the perception that it usually charges more for toys. In fact, in its Manhattan store, Schwarz was selling T.V. Teddy, the interactive teddy bear that is popular this holiday season, for $69.99, while the Toys "R" Us Manhattan store was selling the bear for $76.99. Both stores were selling Toby the Terrier, another interactive toy, for $49.99.
Mr. Eyler insists that Schwarz does not really compete with Toys "R" Us, the country's largest toy seller, and his buyers are working to put distance and difference between the two companies by commissioning exclusive merchandise. About one-third of the items carried in its stores today are exclusive to Schwarz, or double the amount when Mr. Eyler arrived.
The company is using its longstanding ties with manufacturers to develop unique merchandise. In the last year, for instance, a buyer fell in love with a puppy dog-shaped sleeping bag made by a small Portuguese manufacturer, who could not afford to buy the cloth to fill such a big order. So Schwarz financed the purchase, and the sleeping bag, which appeared in itscatalogue, sold out.
A $140 yacht for Barbie is available only at Schwarz stores. Steiff, a German maker of stuffed toys, has made a musical bear especially for the company. And Schwarz also boasts the world's biggest box of crayons, 144 different shades compared with Crayola's 128.
Schwarz is using some of those exclusive items to give itself a tier of lower-priced merchandise. "About 75 percent of our merchandise is under $50, but no one wants to talk about that," Mr. Eyler said. "Everyone wants to talk about the $8,200 Mercedes."
The company is also using its ties to Gund Inc., a maker of plush stuffed toys, to increase its year-round business. The two have teamed up in "Bearmail," a gift business featuring stuffed bears ordered through a toll-free number.
Schwarz is also trying to develop other business that is less dependent on the Christmas season, like books and toys for infants. Mr. Eyler said the company's book sales tripled in the last year.

Despite his caution about the results of the Christmas season, he was upbeat about the toy store chain's long-term prospects. (Suzanne DeChillo/The New York Times)

HEADLINE: A 'New' Russia: Yeltsin Needs Consensus and Cash

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Dec. 22

 BODY:
After the strong vote for the far right and far left, President Boris N. Yeltsin had a serious choice to make about the pace and kind of economic reform. But today, in his first post-election news conference, there was no indication he has made that choice.
His decision to keep Yegor T. Gaidar, a current First Deputy Prime Minister and leader of the reformers, means the probable continuation of a Government so divided that it has been unable to pursue a consistent economic strategy. 
 After two years of on-again, off-again policy that can scarcely be called coherent, many Russian voters rebelled against the instability of this uncharted transition to a market economy.
In response, Mr. Yeltsin spoke of the need to balance the fight against inflation, which is over 15 percent a month and sure to increase, with the need to help the poor.
He also said he would like to provide more social benefits to ease the pain of those who are suffering from the slow transition to a market economy, thus echoing a wish expressed by the Clinton Administration.
 
Who Pays?
 But Mr. Yeltsin did not speak at all about where such money might come from, or about the consistent plea of the reformers and the International Monetary Fund that Russia spend less money on subsidizing otherwise bankrupt and inefficient industries.
In essence, Mr. Yeltsin has followed the usual pattern of the past two years, which is to try to please everyone. And after the harsh message of unhappiness expressed in the elections, the number of constituencies he has to please has increased.
It appears inevitable, from what he said and did not say, that the pace of economic stabilization and structural change, especially for Russia's industrial behemoths, will be significantly slower. The emphasis is likely to be less on stabilization than on production, investment and social welfare.
But the West and the Clinton Administration also have a choice to make, going beyond statements in Washington about finding "less shock and more therapy for the Russian people."
The Administration's talk about the success of its Russia policy has turned quiet, raising doubts about its assumption that the new Russia will be friendly and Western-oriented, and patient with the chaos of economic transformation.
 
Nervous Neighbors
 Now, countries in Central and Eastern Europe are likely to want more than platitudes about security and "Partnerships for Peace," the phrase used by the Administration to bring those nations into NATO without making them full members.
As for Russia itself, Washington may be under pressure to consider a more active engagement -- and an even larger commitment of funds.
For two years, the West has claimed that the success of the Russian transition toward democracy and free markets is the most important task of foreign policy. But the contrast between those stakes and the way support has been provided "has been so sharp," a prominent banker from a multilateral institution said, "as to appear almost contradictory."
Using the International Monetary Fund as their financial agent, the major industrialized nations of the West have set economic criteria for aid that have been very difficult to meet. Russia's failure to control bank credits and subsidies has led the I.M.F. and the West to provide very little aid at all.
And by making the fund the primary vehicle for aid, the industrial nations have washed their hands of serious bilateral commitments and avoided a political commitment to reform.
 
Without a Map
 A senior official of one multilateral agency added: "Nor, in a large sense, has the West given Russia any coherent road map for reform, with specific promises of real aid in steps along the way. It has basically let the I.M.F. do all the talking, junior minister to junior minister."
Western economists also ask whether the I.M.F. is an appropriate agent for the tasks required, which include social welfare, the development of small businesses and investment to convert and strengthen newly privatized enterprises.
Briefing reporters in Washington on Monday, Strobe Talbott, Ambassador at Large for the republics of the former Soviet Union, talked of Washington's new desire for "refining, focusing and intensifying our reform-support efforts," without ever defining what "reform" is.
Is any sort of Russian "reform," short of a reversal to the command economy, good enough for Washington? Is Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin's idea of aggressive investment to protect decaying businesses and empty jobs -- never mind the inflation -- "reform" enough?
But in Washington there have been few officials publicly asking certain questions.
What, for example, is the West's responsibility in Russia? Is the West helping its friends or simply hoping that all will turn out for the best -- in a world of tight domestic budgets where politicians fear being seen to support another country's unemployed?
The problem, one senior banker said, is that the White House seems to think that the Dec. 12 vote means Russians want slower reform, when what they probably want is more stability, less corruption and a tougher fight against crime.
The White House "also seems to buy a tradeoff between economic reform and hardship, which is not clear at all," he said, adding that the hardship from a transition to a market economy is inevitable and that a slower transition may only extend the pain.
If the West wants to pay to assuage the pain, it is likely to cost money. And if the West is going to pay, it might make sense to urge faster reform, not slower.
And if the West is not going to pay to help reform, some in Russia have an answer. Vitaly Tretyakov, editor of Nezavisimayl Gazeta, says the West should stop giving Russians so much advice because, "We've got fools enough of our own."

HEADLINE: Correction: C.I.A. Says Paper On Bosnia Policy Was a Draft

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
The Central Intelligence Agency said today that a document described in a New York Times article today as embodying the agency's conclusions on the crisis in Bosnia and Herzegovina reflected ongoing discussions among analysts and not the settled judgment of the agency.
A C.I.A. spokesman described the document as an unclassified memorandum summarizing various arguments made at a symposium this month by Government intelligence specialists and academic experts on the Balkans. 
 On a copy of the document given to a Times reporter on Monday, the heading and a footnote are obscured and a final page is missing.
A copy of the same document supplied today by Kent Harrington, the C.I.A.'s director of public affairs, bears the heading "National Intelligence Council -- Symposium Notes, 3 December 1993" and a footnote that says in part, "The views expressed in this memorandum do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Intelligence Council or the intelligence community."
 
Suggestions of a Rift
 The Times article said the C.I.A. had concluded that the economic embargo imposed on Serbia 18 months ago was likely to deteriorate and that the West would probably have to accept the ethnic partition of Bosnia. It cited several passages from the symposium notes to support those generalizations.
Both the Bush and the Clinton Administrations have backed United Nations sanctions against Serbia to punish it for its role in the Balkan war and have backed an integral Bosnia. A C.I.A. conclusion to the contrary would therefore open a significant gulf between the agency and the White House, but Mr. Harrington insisted that no such judgment had been reached.
Mr. Harrington said that the National Intelligence Council was currently focusing on Bosnia and that the Dec. 3 symposium was part of that process.
 
The Panel of Analysts
 He said the symposium had been attended by five experts from foundations and universities, a C.I.A. employee, two employees of the Defense Intelligence Agency, a State Department official and three officials of the National Intelligence Council, only one of whom works for the C.I.A.
Government officials said the council had prepared a draft of a new National Intelligence Estimate, based in part on points reflected in the memorandum. Such drafts, the officials cautioned, are subject to revision before final adoption -- sometimes quite substantial revision.
Mr. Harrington noted that at several points, the symposium summary presents conflicting hypotheses and opinions, attributing them to "the majority," "one participant," "some experts" and so on.
The heading on the sixth page of the document, which is missing from the copy originally obtained by The Times, makes the disagreements among the analysts explicit. It reads: "What Kind of Serbia Would Emerge: A Kaleidoscope of Views."

HEADLINE: '95 Budget Projects Drop In Deficit to $190 Billion

BYLINE: By ADAM CLYMER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
The Clinton Administration in February will propose a Federal budget for the next fiscal year that has a deficit "in the vicinity of $190 billion," the White House budget director said today.
The budget chief, Leon E. Panetta, said the Administration had been able to bring the deficit figure down to that level by making "a number of very tough decisions involving cuts across the board," in keeping with a discretionary-spending freeze voted by Congress last summer. 
 Speaking at a news conference, Mr. Panetta said severe cuts, including an Administration plan to phase out operating subsidies for mass transit, had been necessary to pay for increases in programs that President Clinton classifies as "investment." These include spending for the broad anticrime bill that is expected to win final Congressional approval early next year, health research, child immunization, job training, clean-water enforcement, Head Start, national service and education.
 
Pentagon Dispute Settled
 The deficit projection that Mr. Panetta offered today for the next fiscal year, which will begin Oct. 1, is about $60 billion below the White House's estimate for the current year. It is also below the $200.4 billion that was projected only three months ago as next year's deficit. An Administration official said today that the difference was attributable to improved economic assumptions.
Mr. Panetta also reported that the White House's dispute with the Defense Department over the Pentagon's budget had been resolved. He said the military had been allocated an additional $8 billion to $9 billion to cover the cost of pay increases voted by Congress last year.
But, he said, the remainder of the "shortfall" that the military had complained about will not be provided. That sum, $21 billion to $22 billion, would have covered the costs of inflation over five years. When Congress voted to freeze discretionary spending at $540 billion in the budget reconciliation bill last summer, it did not provide for increases due to inflation.
 
Furor on Mass Transit
 After the White House submits the new budget to Congress, the lawmakers will be able to increase the Administration's spending on some programs by imposing equivalent cuts in others. Members of the House from the New York metropolitan area were already at their fax machines today, sending out attacks on the Administration's plan to phase out $800 million in annual mass transit operating subsidies, of which the New York area now receives about $100 million.
Representatives Charles E. Schumer, Jerrold Nadler, Nita M. Lowey and Jose E. Serrano all contended that the phaseout could lead to higher fares. Although it was not clear how quickly the subsidies would be eliminated under the Administration's proposal, Mr. Schumer and Mr. Nadler estimated that the provision would ultimately mean an increase of 10 cents for a ride on the subway or a city bus.
In an interview with radio reporters today, the President, in a more general way, made the same points that Mr. Panetta did.
"This budget will first of all reduce the deficit in fiscal year '95 to below $200 billion," Mr. Clinton said.
"When I became President, it was estimated that the budget deficit would be $300 billion in fiscal year '95," he said. "This is, I think, quite an important achievement. We will do it by reducing funding in 9 of 14 major agencies below the fiscal year '94 levels. We will meet our 100,000-employee personnel reduction by the end of fiscal year '95."
 
Few Figures From Panetta
 Except for the deficit figure, Mr. Panetta declined to give any numbers related to the new budget, including its total size. The reason, he said, is that the basic decisions made by the President now have to be translated "into what are literally hundreds of thousands of numbers that feed into our budget."
But he said hundreds of programs would be cut below their current levels and that spending on hundreds of others would be frozen.
Mr. Panetta said Henry G. Cisneros, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, had succeeded in getting more money for projects to aid the homeless. Mr. Cisneros had sought a doubling of the current $800 million, but Mr. Panetta said, "It will not be as much as the Secretary wanted."
Mr. Panetta said the Administration's ability to hold the deficit as low as $190 billion was a result of "the strong deficit-reduction policies that have been enacted, plus the economic progress that's obviously been made in 1993."
"We feel that the President is, in fact, staying on track with the economic plan that we set in place last year," the budget chief said . "We are continuing our commitments to fiscal discipline and to deficit reduction, as well as to the initiatives that the President feels are most important to the future."

HEADLINE: New Governor Named For the Bank of Canada

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Dec. 22

 BODY:
John Crow, whose Draconian anti-inflation policies have made him a political target in a period of double-digit Canadian unemployment, is stepping down as the governor of Canada's central bank, the Government announced today.
But he is to be replaced by his deputy, Gordon Thiessen, a longtime Bank of Canada employee, who is expected to keep the same emphasis on price stability. 
 The announcement by Finance Minister Paul Martin ended one of the biggest guessing games here since the election of the Liberal Government nearly two months ago.
Mr. Crow's policies had been attacked by many Liberals, including the new Prime Minister, Jean Chretien, whose campaign slogan was "jobs, jobs, jobs." But until now the Government had ducked the issue of whether he would be reappointed when his seven-year term expired next month.
 
Policy Called 'Misguided'
 Bankers had argued that Mr. Crow was essential to maintain the country's financial credibility abroad and prevent a collapse of the Canadian dollar. Yet many on the left wanted to dump him. A recently formed "Crow To Go" coalition called the policy of fighting inflation with high interest rates "misguided and destructive."
Jeff Rubin, the chief economist at Wood Gundy Inc., a leading brokerage firm, said Mr. Crow "became a sacrificial lamb."
The change in the guard did not fluster the markets. The Canadian dollar, after touching a six-year low, rebounded immediately after the announcement and closed against the American dollar at 74.82 cents, up 0.43 cent.
"The market is taking it as a very positive sign that the new governor is someone so closely identified with the present policies," said Katherine Beattie, an economist at MMS International, a financial information service.
Edward Neufeld, executive vice president and chief economist at the Royal Bank, said he expected a "smooth transition" and little political trouble for Mr. Thiessen.
 
Inflation Less Than 2 Percent
 "The new governor is in the fortunate position of not having to drive the inflation rate down any further," he said.
At less than 2 percent, Canada's inflation is about a point lower than that of the United States. But its unemployment, at more than 11 percent, is almost double that of the United States.
Mr. Crow's tenure recalled a period of the early 1980's when the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, Paul A. Volcker, throttled inflation in the United States. Yet Mr. Volcker's efforts did not rouse the same political passions as Mr. Crow's did in Canada, possibly because the austerity in the United States was followed by a strong expanson that created millions of jobs. Canada's growth has not made a dent in the jobless rate.
Like the man he is succeeding, Mr. Thiessen started at the Bank of Canada on the research staff. Although the two men are roughly the same age -- Mr. Thiessen is 55, and Mr. Crow, 56 -- Mr. Thiessen joined the bank 10 years earler, in 1963. In the 60's Mr. Crow held senior staff positions with the International Monetary Fund in Washington.
Mr. Thiessen, whose appointment is effective Feb. 1, becomes the sixth governor and will earn an initial salary of $224,000 Canadian ($168,000).

HEADLINE: Company Reimbursing Excess Fees For Water

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN

 BODY:
A private water company on Long Island that has been the target of consumer protests and government lawsuits agreed yesterday to make $11.7 million in payments to settle pending litigation and state penalties.
Of that amount, $7.1 million will go to customers in Nassau County in the form of credits averaging $260 per household over three years. The other $4.6 million will go to the City of New York, partly to pay back sewer taxes. 
 The company, the Jamaica Water Supply Company, has customers in Queens and western Nassau. As part of the settlement, it also agreed to freeze its rates at their current level for three years and to submit to a tough system of official oversight and financial penalties if its performance and service do not continue to improve.
While customers and government officials hailed the agreement, workers for the company objected. A union representing about half the company's 500 employees said it would meet today to consider calling a strike.
 
Agreement Called Historic
 Danny Frank, a spokesman for the union, Local 374 of the Utility Workers of America, said the agreement is "balanced on the backs of company workers."
Richard M. Kessel, executive director of the State Consumer Protection Board, called the agreement historic.
"After years of controversy and poor service quality, Jamaica Water customers finally have a fair deal," he said. "Up to now, they have been forced to pay twice or three times what customers of municipal water utilities pay."
The agreement was signed by the company and a number of public agencies, including the State Public Service Commission, the State Consumer Protection Board, the State Attorney General, the Nassau County Executive, the New York City Department of Environmental Protection, and Waterbill Watchdogs, an organization of Nassau County homeowners who have been protesting their water bills for years.
Raymond Howell, the president of Waterbill Watchdogs, said his group welcomed the agreement. "We are pleased with the new management team at Jamaica Water and how they have been responsive to the needs of their customers."
 
Higher Water Bills
 The Watchdogs organization says Jamaica Water Supply charges some of its customers in Nassau about $900 a year, or about three times what other consumers pay for water supplied by municipal utilities in the county. In contrast, the organization said the average bill for Queens homeowners was about $200 a year.
Jamaica's president, Hampton D. Graham, disputed the Watchdog's $900 figure, saying the company's average water bill in Nassau, based on using about 100,000 gallons a year, was $450.
Mr. Graham said the wide discrepancies between Jamaica's bills in Nassau and those of municipal utilities in Nassau and its customers in Queens resulted from the fact that the company was taxed by Nassau County on its property in the county, while municipal utilities and the company's property in New York City is not taxed.
All told, the company said it served 650,000 people in 30,000 homes in southwestern Nassau and 90,000 homes in areas of Queens, including Hollis, Jamaica and Jamaica Estates, Kew Gardens, Laurelton, Queens Village, Richmond, Rosedale and St. Albans.
While Nassau customers will get credits toward their bills, Queens customers will not receive any direct benefit, officials said, because their lower bills are already effectively subsidized by New York City because it does not tax the company.
 
Racketeering Suit Ends
 In 1989, the city filed a petition in State Supreme Court to acquire the company's property in Queens by eminent domain. But the petition was dismissed this year.
A joint statement by the company, the State Consumer Protection Board and the Public Service Commission said the agreement provides for a tentative settlement of $10.6 million in economic penalties recommended at a commission proceeding in 1992.

HEADLINE: 3d-Quarter Output Revised Upward to 2.9%

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
Vigorous consumer spending and booming new-car business quickened the pace of economic recovery this fall, the Commerce Department said today, adding momentum for a strong final quarter bolstered by rising Christmas sales.
In its final estimate of national output during the three months from July through September, the department said gross domestic product expanded at a 2.9 percent annual rate instead of 2.7 percent as previously estimated. 
 It also said inflation was restrained in the third quarter, with the implicit price deflator rising at a 1.6 percent rate, the same as previously estimated, and the G.D.P. fixed-weight index up only 2.1 percent instead of 2.2 percent.
 
Good for Holding Rates
 The steady inflation rate may allay concern over a pre-emptive Federal Reserve move early in 1994 to quash any inflation risk by pushing interest rates up. The Clinton Administration is arguing against any such move, contending there is no evidence that prices or wages are rising sharply.
With consumer spending continuing strong, many economists are forecasting fourth-quarter growth exceeding 4 percent before tapering to a slower rate in 1994.
"Right now consumers are in a buying mood and they've been willing to open their wallets to do it," said an economist, Sung Won Sohn of the Norwest Corporation in Minneapolis, warning that rising debt loads might soon put a brake on spending.
"It's quite possible that in the first quarter of 1994, we'll see consumers start holding back on purchases of big-ticket items," said Mr. Sohn, who foresees G.D.P. growing at a 2.5 percent to 3 percent rate in the first half.
But 1993 will end on a strong note. Factories cranked up car assemblies in response to strong sales of new cars and light trucks. A Johnson Redbook Survey of retail shopping on Tuesday showed sales up 7.1 percent in the first three weeks of December from last year's level.
 
Farm Output Rebound
In addition, Commerce officials predicted an increase of four-tenths of a percent in fourth-quarter growth from a rebound in agricultural output. Devastating Midwest floods and drought in the Southeast had slashed third-quarter growth by about six-tenths of a percent by destroying crops.
The economy gained power steadily in 1993, advancing from anemic annual increases of eight-tenths of a percent in the first quarter and 1.9 percent in the second quarter as momentum built.
The key reason for the slight upward increase to 2.9 percent in third-quarter growth was that businesses added about $2.7 billion more goods to inventories than previously estimated. Even though the goods were unsold, they count as more production that pushes up quarterly G.D.P.
The Commerce Department also said today that corporate profits after taxes grew by only seven-tenths of a percent in the third quarter to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $274.3 billion after a much stronger 5.2 percent increase in the second quarter.

HEADLINE: FUTURES MARKETS;
Oil Rallies on Output News; Soybeans Up, Cattle Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Crude oil futures prices rallied strongly from five-year lows on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday on news that six Persian Gulf states were willing to cut production if non-OPEC producers would do the same.
Analysts said that while an effective effort to cut output was unlikely, even the remote possibility was enough to set off buying in the depressed crude market. 
 On other commodity markets, soybean futures rose sharply, leading most grain futures higher, and livestock futures were mixed.
Light sweet crude oil for February delivery rose 41 cents, to $14.77 a barrel; January home-heating oil surged 0.66 cent, to 44.02 cents a gallon; January unleaded gasoline rose 0.03 cent, to 39.41 cents a gallon; January natural gas rose 2 cents, to $2.022 for 1,000 cubic feet.
It was the strongest advance since Sept. 10 for crude oil, which had slid to a five-year low following the refusal on Nov. 24 by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut production.
The Gulf Cooperation Council, an OPEC subgroup composed of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain and Oman, said yesterday that it would reduce production if other producers around the world pledged to do the same.
 
Analyst Skeptical
 But one analyst, Tom Bentz, director of the energy division for Quantum Financial Services in New York, noted that two major non-OPEC producers, Norway and Britain, had already said that they would not cut production.
"I'm not sure they are saying anything that is any different from what's out there right now anyway," he said of the gulf group.
Oil prices also drew support from a weekly American Petroleum Institute report on Tuesday that showed a drop in domestic crude stocks, and from reports this week of oil rig problems in the North Sea.
Soybean futures surged to a four-and-a-half-month high on the Chicago Board of Trade after a Government report showed stronger demand for soy products than traders expected.
The soybean rally helped push near-term corn deliveries briefly above $3 a bushel for the first time since July 2, 1990.
Cattle futures ended mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange but hog futures fell on ideas that cash hog prices will remain weak for the rest of the week.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar in Steep Drop Linked To Comments by Bentsen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended sharply lower against most currencies in slow trading yesterday, under pressure from lower domestic interest rates and comments by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen.
Gold prices also declined worldwide. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for February delivery, the most active futures contract, settled at $387.20 an ounce, off $2.10 from Tuesday. 
 The dollar had climbed to a seven-month high against the Japanese yen in overnight trading in Tokyo after comments Tuesday by Mr. Bentsen indicating he did not see a need for the United States to intervene in currency markets to support the yen. Traders interpreted his comments as a sign that they could buy dollars.
But as the dollar climbed, Mr. Bentsen released a statement yesterday expressing concern that Japan had not met its commitment in reducing its trade surplus and stimulating its economy. That sent the dollar plummeting on the notion that the Federal Reserve might be willing to buy yen to support it.
"It's not necessarily true, but that's the market's knee-jerk reaction," said Andrew Busch, a trader with the Harris Trust and Savings Bank in Chicago.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 111.30 yen, up 0.55 yen from Tuesday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 110.50 yen. In New York the dollar settled at 110.40 yen, down from 111.18 on Tuesday.
Dealers also said lower interest rates were putting pressure on the dollar. The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond fell to 6.21 percent, from 6.31 percent Tuesday.
Lower interest rates make dollar-denominated securities less valuable, thereby lessening investors' need for the American currency.
In London, the British pound rose to $1.4946, from $1.4880 late Tuesday. In New York it cost $1.4968 to buy one pound, more expensive than Tuesday's $1.4880.
Separately, there were rumors that the Bank of Canada had entered the market to buy Canadian dollars at the expense of the American dollar. "The Canadian dollar was down sharply, but it ended up closing sharply" off those lows, said Michael Malepede, an analyst with Refco Group Ltd. in Chicago.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
If scalpers can get so much, why aren't tickets costlier?

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
BARNEY, idol of the Oshkosh B'Gosh set, is coming to Radio City Music Hall in March. But unless you are prescient -- or very rich or very indulgent -- the tike in your life is going to miss the chance to see the purple dinosaur in the polyester.
Tickets for all 11 shows sold out in two hours. The only way to get them now is through brokers who are selling $30-list seats for as much as $200 -- a fact that has raised the dander of New York City's Department of Consumer Affairs, which will be trying to collect fines under New York State's anti-scalping law. 
 No doubt the slowly unfolding Barney affair will keep grandparents at high dudgeon for weeks. But Richard Thaler, an economist at Cornell University, thinks the furor over ticket scalping obscures a far more interesting quirk in capitalism: If the seats could have been sold for more than $30, why didn't Radio City charge more than $30? More generally, why are legitimate sellers -- everyone from the producers of hit Broadway plays to the owners of this month's chic restaurant -- so often reluctant to use prices to ration scarce supply?
A cynic might look to the darker side of human nature for the answer: Keeping prices below the figure that matches demand with supply creates opportunities for box office employees, headwaiters and the like to make a dishonest living by marking up the scarce space on their own. But Gary Becker, the Nobel Prize-winning economist from the University of Chicago, points out that this hardly explains why their bosses put up with it, or why rationing by price is traditional practice in some industries (steel, airline tickets, soybeans) and almost unheard of in others.
Mr. Becker thinks that success begets success -- and that good entrepreneurs recognize it. Steel is steel and airline seats are airline seats; you generally know what you are getting from the price or the description in the catalogue. But the quality of a book, movie or Caribbean resort is a matter of judgment, he notes, and one way to judge it is by its popularity with others. Thus the line outside a new restaurant or a two-month delay for tickets to "Angels in America" may certify the product as worth buying.
Put it another way: If the restaurant moves swiftly to eliminate the line by doubling the price of the entrees, the absence of a wait may reduce profits along with the demand for reservations. Indeed, its popularity may prove to be very sensitive to menu prices over time, as empty tables beget more empty tables. Mr. Becker thinks this helps to explain why the demand for entertainment in general is apparently so fickle, and so hard to forecast.
But Mr. Thaler is unconvinced. Year in, year out, he notes, the Super Bowl is a sellout. Yet there is surely no risk that higher ticket prices would prevent the stadium from being filled, or reduce the value of television ad time to makers of beer, socket wrenches and other guy things. Far from it: reports of the $1,000 prices charged by Super Bowl ticket scalpers have become a routine part of the hype.
Why, then, the relatively low prices for Super Bowl tickets, or for that matter, third row-center orchestra seats for hit shows on Broadway? Gerald Schoenfeld, the head of the Shubert Organization, which owns a dozen theaters and produces plays, offers a clue: "There's a strong public relations argument" against raising prices when costs remain unchanged, he laments. "We are often told that Broadway ticket prices are too high," and are loath "to add fuel to the fire."
Mr. Thaler agrees, though he puts it somewhat differently. Those with businesses cannot afford the "perception of unfairness," he argues. Hence Broadway producers hold the line on ticket prices even when they have a blockbuster on their hands, and ski resorts charge only a modest premium in high season. "If you gouge skiers at Christmas," he says, "they won't come back in March."
By contrast, Mr. Thaler suggests, a championship boxing match is a one-time event that generates no good or bad will to help or haunt the promoter. Thus ringside seats can and are priced at astronomical sums.
All this may explain why some prices aren't raised rapidly in the face of scarcity. But it doesn't entirely explain why, say, theater owners would care enough about scalping to press the government to make it illegal, and then lobby for tough enforcement.
One possibility is that the objection to scalping is itself a public relations ritual, used to make clear to potential buyers that the initial sellers are not callous profiteers and are not benefiting from the higher prices in the resale market. Or it may be that they simply share the outrage of the public.
Americans, it seems, may be happy to argue in the abstract that free markets are better than the alternatives. But their enthusiasm for the real thing turns on a far more complex calculus of right and wrong.

HEADLINE: The Crafts of America Find Recognition at the Top

BYLINE: By RITA REIF

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
TWENTY years ago, Leon and Sharon Niehues were part of a back-to-the-land movement. After they left Kansas for the Ozarks of Arkansas, he worked all day, splitting trees at local sawmills, and at nights and on weekends they taught themselves from a book to make baskets. Not just ordinary baskets, but lacy, double-walled, two-toned, witty affairs that have been exhibited in museums and galleries from Portland, Me., to Tokyo, and command prices sometimes in the four figures.
The Niehues are among the many crafts artisans now giving ancient technology some modern twists and developing new methods to produce crafts with heightened appeal to the eye and the touch. 
 "The field has grown from a handful of well-known individuals to large numbers of practicing craftsmen, many with a great sense of sophistication and commitment," said Michael Monroe, the curator of 20th century crafts at the Renwick Gallery of the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of American Art. "Twenty years ago there was one magazine, Craft Horizons, serving all the media. Today there are 10 or more, specializing in glass, ceramics, metal, fiber and wood."
This expansion has also been seen in the growth of crafts collections at museums, the proliferation of craft fairs, from a handful to hundreds each year, and since 1973, the tripling of the number of art galleries that show crafts.
"And the boom has not weakened but strengthened the vision of craftsmen," Mr. Monroe said. "They are increasingly adventurous in exploring technology and everything about crafts."
Perhaps nothing has brought as much attention to the field as the first exhibition of contemporary crafts at the White House, which showcases some of the best and brightest objects made today by Americans, with dazzling displays that have transformed tabletops, mantels and window sills.
Hailed by professionals and viewed by many as an unofficial endorsement of the field, the show includes works of glass, wood, fiber, ceramic and metal by studio-trained and self-educated artists.
Several hundred thousand artisans in America now make a full-time living at their crafts, signaling a flourishing of the field, which was unimaginable 30 years ago. The objects shown at the White House reflect most of the major trends in the crafts of the 1990's: the lavish gilding, hand forming even of glass vessels, layered constructions, exotic surfaces and technological innovations that are helping to distinguish and popularize crafts across the country.
The White House show came just in time to catch the end of the Year of American Craft, which was proclaimed a year ago today, when President George Bush signed a bill passed by Congress.
While the observance spurred scores of fairs and symposiums for craft artists, the general public remained largely unaware of the celebration until the Christmas decorations were completed at the White House on Dec. 6, and the doors were flung wide for public viewing. Tickets are available daily at the East Gate, beginning at 8 A.M. By Jan. 1, the day crafts displays are dismantled, about 150,000 visitors will have filed through the 12 hallways and rooms.
"Some trees are hung four deep in angels," said Hillary Rodham Clinton. She added that she was astonished at the ornaments produced by 3,000 artisans across the country. Even more important are the objects of 65 craftsmen, both prominent professionals and less-known artisans, who were invited to contribute bowls, baskets and other table-top-size items to the White House collection.
"This is the icing on the cake rather than the cake," said Harvey Littleton, the dean of American glass craftsmen. "It implies recognition. I hope we can circulate these crafts so that there will be a wider public acceptance and a firmer footing nationally for crafts."
Mrs. Clinton said she chose crafts as the theme of the White House Christmas decor "partly because of my own personal interest in American crafts -- we have a very small collection of mostly pottery." Mr. Littleton said that the traveling exhibition that Mrs. Clinton envisions would have been as unthinkable 30 years ago as the exhibition of crafts at the White House. In fact, in the 1960's when he began producing art glass, very few of his colleagues made a living at crafts.
Three decades ago, glass makers, weavers and ceramists took it for granted that they would supplement their incomes with other work -- mostly by teaching. And they became full-time craftsmen only in the 1970's or 1980's, said Mr. Monroe, who was the adviser to the White House on its exhibition.
While the public became aware of the Year of American Craft only after the White House show, Anne (Susie) Gray, the originator of the concept, who helped lobby the bill through Congress, is not displeased. Mrs. Gray, a New Hampshire craftsman who founded the Smithsonian Crafts Fair in Washington, said: "We purposely aimed our thrust of activities at the grass-roots level. That's where there is a strong creative energy. Without the input of regional crafts, artists become so involved in esthetics, they begin to lose all connection in their work to people."
Suffice it to say that most of the master craftsmen are represented, including Wendell Castle, who sent a laminated wood clock, and Joel Philip Myers, whose round glass vase depicting red and purple poppies glows in the morning light on a window sill. Joan Mondale, who filled the Vice-Presidential mansion with crafts in the late 1970's, sent one of her small pots embellished with calligraphy.
The most enterprising artisans today prove how far crafts have come from the days when it meant only rudimentary wind chimes and macrame. Toots Zynsky, an American now living in Paris, creates bowls with fused glass fibers that imitate fabric -- and you can feel the threads.
Laney K. Oxman, a Virginia potter, combines decals, paint and 24-carat gold to achieve the images of nostalgia she devises on her multi-fired pedestal bowls.
Craft skills and the taste for the same media are inherited in some families, judging by the works of three fathers and sons whose work is represented at the White House.
Mr. Littleton sent to the White House three trumpet-like blue orchids from his North Carolina studio. his son John and his wife, Kate Vogel, also of North Carolina, produced the show's most amusing tromp l'oeil sculpture -- a stack of blown-glass sacks, satiny in texture, with colors to match: blue, green, purple and red. The craftsmen in the two other families -- Melvin and Mark Lindquist of Florida and Edward and Philip Moulthrop of Georgia -- are wood-turners.
While innovative glass dominates the White House displays, as it does museum shows and craft fairs, some of the most decorative crafts today are ceramics. And among the masters is Bennett Bean, a potter for 30 years who began in the late 1980's to add gesso and gold leaf to his vessels. And he didn't stop there, emblazoning the one at the White House with gilding, an American flag and lots of patterning.
"I don't see that the White House exhibition will change the world," Mr. Bean said. "But I'd love it if what the Clintons have started will do for crafts what Jackie Kennedy did for an awareness of decor."
Mrs. Clinton agreed. "I'd love it, too," she said. "As we find ourselves buffeted about in today's world, handicraft takes on more meaning. Besides, I view crafts as an essential economic activity. There may be thousands of people making a living at crafts today. It's a real growth industry."

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
Crime and Black Images in TV News

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
"Viewpoint," the useful ABC program that gives critics of television news a chance to confront its perpetrators, recently devoted 90 minutes to "Crime, Violence and TV News." Although more was bitten off than could be chewed, troubling questions were raised about the evening's hottest issue, the coverage of crimes committed by young black men.
Jeff Greenfield's scene-setting and Ted Koppel's questions were well aimed, and the criticism by the black panelists -- among them the writer Ishmael Reed; the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d, a prominent New York City minister; Fred Thomas, the Washington chief of police; Representative Walter R. Tucker 3d, a Democrat from Los Angeles, and several journalists -- was unsparing. 
Here, in sum, is the charge:
*Crime stories, staples of local-news programs, lack context. In the competition to be first with live reports on death and other carnage, these programs often deliver pictures of the consequences of violence before many of the facts are in. Mr. Greenfield quoted the news producer's adage: "If it bleeds, it leads."
*As a reflection of a skewed justice system, white criminals are treated more gently on the tube than black criminals, and not enough attention is paid to ordinary, law-abiding black families. There is a paucity of positive stories about black life to counter the steady stream of blood and bullets.
*Too few black programmers hold decision-making jobs in television.
The problem is more serious than some of the complaints. Whatever the deficiencies of the police and the courts, for television purposes white crime is just as welcome as black crime. Amy Fisher, Joel Rifkin, Leona Helmsley, the Los Angeles police officers who beat Rodney G. King and many others have received hours of unflattering tube time. Local television news, after all, is an offspring of tabloid newspapers, and they have always doted on villains, race no object.
Still, the suspects seen on television being arrested in muggings and shootings are almost always black men in their teens and 20's, and they figure hugely in the prevailing anxiety, among blacks as well as whites, over personal safety. Nobody is afraid of Leona Helmsley. Mr. Reed's call for more stories about cocaine use in white, middle-class suburbs is simply a distraction.
The rules of journalism require that violent crimes be covered, but it is the rules of the tabloids that require them to be covered prominently, frequently and graphically. The crime of the local-news shows is not that they treat whites better or don't report enough positive stories about blacks. (There are plenty of those, although the doings of hard-working, honest citizens, of whatever shade, have never sold newspapers). It is that their thirst for blood is unslak able. If a fresh murder is not available, a nasty accident will serve. You don't have to be black to be distressed by the result or concerned about its impact.
Some nights, the attention given to crimes of violence turns reality into the surreal. No positive stories can compete with the recurrent images of shackled black youths. Add to this the near-hysterical language of the television reporters, whose vocabularies are not by and large extensive (what would they do without the words "tragic" and "shocking" and "brutal"?), and daily life becomes a theater of horror. (Network news, too, has been focusing more on crime lately, but in a less Gothic mood.)
Such has always been the stuff of the tabloids, on the principle that the higher the anxiety level, the better for business. Mr. Greenfield's call for more reporting about the suffering and pain caused by inner-city violence to complement or replace the pictures of corpses is just an invitation to another, softer sort of tabloid ism, which in fact is by no means neglected by local-news shows. Unfortunately, that may be as much as one can hope for, but it only reinforces the identification of blacks with crime, whether as victims or criminals.
If, Mr. Butts desires, there were more blacks running news departments, there would presumably be more sensitivity to the messages being sent forth. But black executives, too, would be under the pressure of ratings, and in that competition, instant crime in the form of punchy pictures that tell strong, simple stories is premium merchandise.
Surveys reported on "Viewpoint" indicate that most Americans think there is too much violence on the tube. That may be what they tell survey takers, and they can also tell it to the marines. The men and women who run local stations know better. The success of the bloody-minded so-called reality-based shows and the proliferating news magazines, whose stock in trade is crime, is a more convincing measure.
My impression as a constant viewer is that the reporters, news directors and even executives at most local stations, at least in New York City, have been making an effort to present positive stories about black families and to give more time to other aspects of city life than bloodshed. The black anchors and reporters themselves are admirable role models. So the programs seem to be improving, at least around the edges, but the content is still chronically tilted toward mayhem.
Exactly what effects this grisly diet (which is peculiarly garnished with lighthearted chitchat like watercress on raw hamburger) has on its audiences remains unclear, but even its practitioners do not contend it can be wholesome. Yet how much can even the best-intentioned of them do about it, tempted as they must be by the technical wonders of the medium and constrained by its economic imperatives?
Their line of work, which features fast, easy, cheap, on-the-spot grabbers, does not allow for much background or interpretation, and the competition to keep viewers tuned to their channels works strongly against anything that strains the mind. News directors feed their audience sweetened sensationalism because nutritious fare can be risky.
That observation is not offered as an excuse for surrender, just as a fact of existence in commercial television. More power, then, to programs like "Viewpoint" for at least drawing attention to the ailment and compelling some of the professionals to explain what they think they are up to. The success of Mr. Koppel's "Nightline" indicates that there is an audience for something different. Things do change, and disgusted viewers must take what hope they can from the change in public taste since crowds were drawn to reality-based entertainment in the form of hangings and beheadings.

HEADLINE: ON THE WAY HOME WITH: Diane Von Furstenberg;
Always Room For Old Beaus

BYLINE: By GEORGIA DULLEA

 BODY:
THE dark green Jaguar was on its weekend run from Fifth Avenue in Manhattan to the hills of Litchfield County. Behind the wheel, a woman with major cheekbones and a quirky European accent was talking about "Christmas in Connecticut."
Not the 1940's movie in which a magazine writer (Barbara Stanwyck) and a war hero (Dennis Morgan) find love under the mistletoe -- not that celluloid chestnut. 
 No, this was a real-life "Christmas in Connecticut" for the 90's, in which a fashion designer who used to be a princess (Diane Von Furstenberg) becomes the queen of the QVC home-shopping channel. She celebrates the holiday by decking the halls of her country estate with evergreen swags and old beaus. "If you've loved somebody," she said, "they always remain part of your life."
The ranking old beau (Barry Diller) is an entertainment mogul. (As the chairman of QVC, he's trying to take over Paramount Communications, and she has a piece of the action. But that's another movie.)
Also spending Christmas on the designer's 100-acre spread, Cloudwalk Farm, will be her former husband, the prince (Egon Von Furstenberg). She refers to him as "my first husband," though she has been married only once. She describes their children (Alexandre, 23, and Tatiana, 22) as "my best patterns."
Alex, as he is known, works for Allen & Company, a financial-services firm; his sister is an editorial intern at The Daily News. The paper's publisher (Mortimer Zuckerman) is another old beau.
"Before I go on, I want to ask you something," Diane Von Furstenberg said, barely touching the wheel of the Jaguar. "Do you like Mexican fast food?"
"Love it."
"You're sure? You see, I usually stop where they have the best burritos, but . . ."
"Take me there."
Ms. Von Furstenberg seemed a bit overdressed for burritos. She was done up in beige and black with several strips of silky cashmere looped around her throat. "It's called pashmina," she said. "Spell it? I don't spell it, I wear it. Pashmina. It's from those few little hairs under the animal's chin, but only goats in certain regions and only on certain mountains."
She looked splendid. On New Year's Eve, she will turn 47. She has certainly had a long run, as these things go, probably because of this itch she gets every few years to reinvent herself.
Right now, the thing is selling her silk sportswear on QVC and posing on the sofa with Mr. Diller in his suite at the Waldorf-Astoria as the photographer Annie Leibovitz snaps them for Vanity Fair's "1993 Hall of Fame." (Ms. Von Furstenberg is a contributing editor of the magazine.)
In its December issue, Vanity Fair calls the Diller-Von Furstenberg team "a power couple that have doubled their power," noting that "together they stroll hand in hand down the information superhighway."
At the moment, it was just the Hutchinson River Parkway and just the Jaguar, a gift from Mr. Diller. Mind you, this was hardly the first time that she had talked about her professional and private lives, which are pretty much the same thing, but it was worth going along for the ride.
Remember the wrap dress? Surely no woman over 40 has forgotten. A Belgian-born designer who studied economics at the University of Geneva, Ms. Von Furstenberg was just 25 in 1972 when she created a little jersey dress not unlike those worn by European women. She just knew it would lure American women out of pants suits. Four years later, she had sold 30 million of the dresses -- to women of all ages, shapes and incomes -- and she was on Newsweek magazine's cover.
The strategy behind the dresses, as Ms. Von Furstenberg once put it, was simply this: "You can wear them with serious heels, serious pearls, walk into a serious restaurant, and still show your bottom."
The wrap dress lives -- and not just in costume collections and thrift shops. Sometimes when Ms. Von Furstenberg is giving a talk out of town, a woman in the audience will walk up, throw open her coat -- and smile. "I love seeing those old dresses, those old friends," she said in the car.
But she added, "I don't want to be somebody who did something when she was 25."
Her idea of not living in the past is doing a "Midnight Special" on QVC, moving 12,000 of her silk shirts, at $59.95 each, in less than 20 minutes. "Sitting in the green room and watching all the numbers come up on the computer screen is like being at a horse race," she said.
From time to time, her story was interrupted by phone calls in several languages. (She speaks four.) And once, during a chat with her housekeeper on decorating plans for "Christmas in Connecticut," there was a momentary sense that Martha Stewart had somehow commandeered the wheel.
The moment soon passed, however, as Ms. Von Furstenberg went on to talk about her strange and enchanted existence in the 80's. "I was four and a half years with Paolo and four and a half years with Alain," she said at one point. "That's my quota."
Paolo was a Brazilian art dealer with whom she shared a bamboo hut by the beach on the island of Bali. The interlude inspired her to create a perfume, Volcan d'Amour, and to decorate her Fifth Avenue offices with Balinese artifacts, including a flock of wooden geese. The geese remain, but Paolo has flown. "He's the only one I'm not still close to," she said.
After Bali came Paris, where she set up a literary salon and founded a publishing house, Salvy. "Writing is the one art I am most sensitive to," she said. "I have a weakness for writers." In particular, there was the novelist Alain Elkann, with whom she shared an apartment on the Left Bank. He's an old beau.
"Alain came three Christmases ago with his children," she recalled with a light laugh. "Funny, his children and my children are cousins, because his first wife and my first husband are cousins. There were too many around the table that day."
In the 80's, the DVF signature sold more than $1 billion worth of licensed products -- everything from eyeglasses to luggage. The royalties were rolling in, she said, but her label was being ruined by the manufacturers.
"They were doing junk," she said. "I tried to talk to them, but they wouldn't listen. I could tell they thought: 'She's a has-been. What does she know?' "
Her voice grew edgy as she described how she did what few designers have managed to do. "I decided to bite the bullet and take back my name," she said. "In some cases, I had to buy it back; in some cases, beg it back, all kind of ways. My accountant was not happy, but it was worth it to be back in fashion and beauty."
She sighed. "Those years from '89 to '92 were very difficult. I ate a lot of humble pies."
It was time for a burrito break. The Jaguar pulled into Texas Taco, a roadside spot in Patterson, N.Y., permanently decorated for Christmas -- twinkling colored lights, walls spray-painted gold, gnomes, kewpie dolls. The owner, Rosemary Jamison, had bright green hair, and "Silent Night" was playing in the bathroom.
After polishing off a burrito, some guacamole and a glass of cider, Ms. Von Furstenberg daintily pressed a napkin to her lips. "I ate like a pig in front of you," she said with a half smile. She is not an extravagant smiler. Her look, even during a "Midnight Special," is one of languor.
The final leg of the journey was marked by a near-collision with a squirrel and more talk of Mr. Diller. "We met 18 years ago and fell in love -- no question," she said. "Barry and I were together five years, from '75 to '80. He loved me unconditionally and still does.
"But our relationship is different now because it just is. He's a little bit like my husband except that we are not married. He's definitely family."
The Jaguar was almost home. Flashing by the windows were rolling hills, open fields, old stone fences. Another half smile.
"In my house you'll see where each man leaves something behind, eh?" she said. "Barry left the movie projector. Paolo left Balinese textiles, and Alain left a lot of books. A house is very much a home."
Cloudwalk Farm, at last. And leaping about on the raked gravel drive, a welcoming committee of dogs. There was her cocker spaniel, Tatiana's Dalmatian, a German shepherd that used to belong to Paolo, a couple of mutts and a Rottweiler whose mate, Alex's Rottweiler, was penned up.
She bought the farm 20 years ago with part of her wrap-dress fortune. It has an apple orchard, gardens, a stream with a waterfall and, dotted around the landscape, five 18th-century buildings. Serving as her studio is a converted tobacco barn with soaring ceilings, Warhol portraits of D.V.F., plantation chairs and a twig bed.
Always, she said, this has been "a private place," a family retreat. But that may be changing.
The stream with the waterfall was in the September issue of Vanity Fair, and so was Ms. Von Furstenberg, afloat in a cast-iron bathtub full of soap bubbles, to promote her new book, "The Bath" (Random House, $37.50). The tobacco barn was recently shown on QVC, along with the designer perched barefoot on the edge of another tub to promote her new line of home and body fragrances, Surroundings.
"Welcome to my bathroom," she said into the cameras.
Now there was to be another revelation as she set off across the lawn, dark hair flying, dogs barking. She paused before a small wooden bridge leading to the other side of the stream and a stand of red birches.
"Come," she said. "I'll show you where I'm going to be buried."

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Rise Sharply In Late Rally

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The Treasury market rallied sharply yesterday as strong demand at the auction for five-year notes and sudden buying interest from investors gave prices a lift on the last full day of trading before Christmas. The price of the 30-year bond jumped more than a point as the yield dropped to 6.21 percent.
"I think there was some pent-up demand waiting to get past the auctions," said John Costas, head of government trading and sales at CS First Boston. 
 Traders and investors often worry that a Treasury auction will be disappointing, so they wait until the auctions finish before they jump in.
And Mr. Costas said many traders had been selling Treasury securities recently, expecting to pick up two-year and five-year notes in the auctions Tuesday and yesterday.
 
 
Dealers Caught Short
 But when the demand at the auction turned out a lot stronger than expected, the dealers were caught without the notes they needed and had to buy in the open market.
With the light recent trading -- including a remarkably slow morning yesterday -- the sudden move carried more weight than usual, and was able to lift prices on Treasury securities across the board.
In late trading in the secondary market at 5 P.M., the price of the 30-year bond due in August 2023 was up 1 7/32 points as the yield, which moves in the opposite direction, fell to 6.21 percent, down from 6.31 percent Tuesday. This is the lowest the yield has been since Dec. 10. The yield on the bond hit a 25-year low of 5.78 percent on Oct. 15. But since early November, the yield has been in a trading range between 6.10 and 6.38 percent and was near the top of that range yesterday.
But yesterday's rally did not change the tone or direction of the market or the outlook of traders and investors. The 30-year bond and other Treasury securities are still locked in a trading range that tends to produce selling at the top and buying at the bottom, where market prices were in early trading yesterday.
 
 
'A Christmas Present'
 "The market likes to give itself a Christmas present," said Donald Fine, chief market analyst at Chase Securities. "But I would be surprised if it goes outside of the trading range before the end of the year."
Once the new year has arrived, though, the market is likely to be tested. While traders and investors have apparently accepted the strong 4 to 5 percent growth now assumed for the fourth quarter of this year, they are counting on the pace of growth to slow at the beginning of 1994. If it does not, then some strong selling may emerge.
Investors are also waiting on the Federal Reserve, which many analysts predict must raise short-term interest rates early in 1994 to prove its determination to keep inflation from breaking out of a two-year lull in which it has stayed under 3 percent. That expectation has already pushed short-term market rates higher.
 
 
Two-Year Note's Yield Drops
 The yield on the new two-year note, which was auctioned Tuesday, also fell sharply yesterday, ending at 4.18 percent. It was auctioned at a yield of 4.28 percent, which slipped to 4.25 percent Tuesday. But that was still the higher yield since June and the top of the recent trading range.
In the $11 billion, five-year note auction, the high yield, which all the securities are sold at, was 5.19 percent, down from the 5.20 percent of last month.
The expectation ahead of the 1 P.M. auction deadline was that the yield would be as high as 5.23 percent, so the results were quite a surprise, reflecting strong demand because dealers and their customers were willing to pay more than expected to get the new notes.
At the same time, the dealers who thought the yield would be higher and the price lower did not get any notes. Since many had already sold some to customers ahead of the auction, they had to buy the notes quickly, which helped add momentum to the rally.
The following are the results from the Treasury auction of five-year notes yesterday:

(000 omitted in dollar figures)
 
High Yield . . . 5.19%
Low Yield . . . 5.15%
Median Yield . . . 5.19%

HEADLINE: Daughter of Castro Leaves Cuba And Is Given Asylum in the U.S.

BYLINE: By TIM WEINER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
Fidel Castro's daughter has fled Cuba and has been granted political asylum in the United States, State Department officials said today.
The woman, Alina Fernandez Revuelta, arrived in Atlanta on Tuesday on a flight from Spain after her asylum request was granted by the United States Embassy in Madrid, said David Johnson, a State Department spokesman. 
 Mrs. Fernandez, who is 37, is personally and politically estranged from her father, who conceived her out of wedlock when he was a young revolutionary. She has sought to leave Cuba for years, denouncing her father as "a tyrant" and describing Cuban Communism as "a dead-end street." She fled alone, leaving her 15-year-old daughter in Havana.
Her flight is a small but significant political statement against Mr. Castro and his increasingly bedraggled 35-year-old Government.
 
Economy in Steep Decline
 Since the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe in 1989, Cuba's economy, which relied heavily on subsidies from the Soviet Union, has been in a steep decline, contracting by more than 40 percent. This year's sugar harvest was the smallest in 30 years. Annual export revenues have fallen from more than $5 billion to $1.6 billion.
The Central Intelligence Agency reported this summer that "the impact of the economic crisis on the populace has been devastating." Food shortages have caused malnutrition and disease, public transportation has collapsed and half the labor force is looking for work, the agency reported.
Political resistance to Mr. Castro is becoming louder and freer. On Friday, witnesses said, thousands of demonstrators shouting "Freedom! Freedom! Freedom!" marched 12 miles from Havana to a shrine devoted to Lazarus, the biblical figure who rose from the dead.
"This is not just an economic crisis," said Jose Cardenas, a spokesman for the Cuban American National Foundation, a Washington research group opposed to Mr. Castro. "It's something more profound. There is a political, spiritual, social crisis on the island. And that is why Alina Fernandez is important. She needed something more and that was freedom."
Mr. Castro has neither acknowledged nor denied fathering Mrs. Fernandez, who never took his surname or had a real relationship with him, according to biographers of the Cuban leader.
 
A Clandestine Courier
 Her mother, Natalia Revuelta, a wealthy, socially prominent and well-educated woman still living in Cuba, met Mr. Castro in November 1952, according to Tad Szulc's biography, "Fidel: A Critical Portrait" (William Morrow and Company, 1986).
Though married to a prominent surgeon, a heart specialist, Mrs. Revuelta fell in love with the young revolutionary as well as with his revolution. She became a clandestine courier of texts and proclamations supporting Mr. Castro in the 1950's. Their relationship took root not long after the first major uprising of Mr. Castro's revolution, the attack on the Moncada Barracks in Santiago de Cuba on July 26, 1953, celebrated annually under Mr. Castro's Government.
Their daughter, Mrs. Fernandez, was conceived in revolution but came of age in its less than glorious aftermath.
Married at least three times, thin and asthmatic, she lived with her daughter, an aspiring dancer, in a down-at-the-heels two-bedroom apartment in Havana adorned with photographs of her mother as a secretly subversive socialite in the 1950's and of herself as a fashion model in the 1980's. Her mother, Mrs. Revuelta, lived nearby and gave support both to the father of the Cuban revolution and to the child he fathered.
 
Visa Requests Denied
 Before her flight, Mrs. Fernandez had left Cuba only once, at age 8, with her mother on a trip to Paris in 1964. She was denied permission to accompany her husband, a Mexican, to Mexico City in 1986. Her requests for visas were denied as recently as last year, Mr. Cardenas said.
State Department officials and Mr. Cardenas said Mrs. Fernandez was deeply upset that word of her flight had become public, that she wanted to keep her silence for the time being and wanted most of all to be reunited with her daughter.
In Havana, the Government said it had no details on Mrs. Fernandez's case. Reuters quoted the Cuban Foreign Minister, Roberto Robaina, as saying that he never commented on "those who defect," and then adding, "I think that at times like this many people have defected because the situation of the country is difficult -- and these are times in which people prove themselves."
